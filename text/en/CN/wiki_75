<text>In mathematics and functional analysis, a direct integral or Hilbert integral is a generalization of the concept of direct sum. The theory is most developed for direct integrals of Hilbert spaces and direct integrals of von Neumann algebras. The concept was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann in one of the papers in the series &quot;On Rings of Operators&quot;. One of von Neumann&#x27;s goals in this paper was to reduce the classification of (what are now called) von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of so-called factors. Factors are analogous to full matrix algebras over a field, and von Neumann wanted to prove a continuous analogue of the Artin–Wedderburn theorem classifying semi-simple rings.

Results on direct integrals can be viewed as generalizations of results about finite-dimensional C*-algebras of matrices; in this case the results are easy to prove directly. The infinite-dimensional case is complicated by measure-theoretic technicalities.

Direct integral theory was also used by George Mackey in his analysis of systems of imprimitivity and his general theory of induced representations of locally compact separable groups.

== Direct integrals of Hilbert spaces ==
The simplest example of a direct integral are the &quot;L&quot;2 spaces associated to a (σ-finite) countably additive measure μ on a measurable space &quot;X&quot;. Somewhat more generally one can consider a separable Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; and the space of square-integrable &quot;H&quot;-valued functions

:formula_1

Terminological note: The terminology adopted by the literature on the subject is followed here, according to which a measurable space &quot;X&quot; is referred to as a &quot;Borel space&quot; and the elements of the distinguished σ-algebra of &quot;X&quot; as Borel sets, regardless of whether or not the underlying σ-algebra comes from a topological space (in most examples it does). A Borel space is &quot;standard&quot; if and only if it is isomorphic to the underlying Borel space of a Polish space; all Polish spaces of a given cardinality are isomorphic to each other (as Borel spaces). Given a countably additive measure μ on &quot;X&quot;, a measurable set is one that differs from a Borel set by a null set. The measure μ on &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;standard&quot; measure if and only if there is a null set &quot;E&quot; such that its complement &quot;X&quot; − &quot;E&quot; is a standard Borel space. All measures considered here are σ-finite.

Definition. Let &quot;X&quot; be a Borel space equipped with a countably additive measure μ. A &quot;measurable family of Hilbert spaces&quot; on (&quot;X&quot;, μ) is a family {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot;∈ &quot;X&quot;, which is locally equivalent to a trivial family in the following sense: There is a countable partition

:formula_2

of &quot;X&quot; by measurable subsets formula_3 such that

:formula_4

where H&quot;n&quot; is the canonical &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Hilbert space, that is

:formula_5

In the above, formula_6 is the space of square summable sequences; all infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to formula_7

A &quot;cross-section&quot; of {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot;∈ &quot;X&quot; is a family {&quot;s&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;s&quot;&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;. A cross-section is measurable if and only if its restriction to each partition element &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is measurable. We will identify measurable cross-sections &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; that are equal almost everywhere. Given a measurable family of Hilbert spaces, the direct integral

:formula_8

consists of equivalence classes (with respect to almost everywhere equality) of measurable square integrable cross-sections of {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot;∈ &quot;X&quot;. This is a Hilbert space under the inner product

:formula_9

Given the local nature of our definition, many definitions applicable to single Hilbert spaces apply to measurable families of Hilbert spaces as well.

Remark. This definition is apparently more restrictive than the one given by von Neumann and discussed in Dixmier&#x27;s classic treatise on von Neumann algebras. In the more general definition, the Hilbert space &quot;fibers&quot; &quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot; are allowed to vary from point to point without having a local triviality requirement (local in a measure-theoretic sense). One of the main theorems of the von Neumann theory is to show that in fact the more general definition is equivalent to the simpler one given here.

Note that the direct integral of a measurable family of Hilbert spaces depends only on the measure class of the measure μ; more precisely:

Theorem. Suppose μ, ν are σ-finite countably additive measures on &quot;X&quot; that have the same sets of measure 0. Then the mapping

:formula_10

is a unitary operator

:formula_11

=== Example ===

The simplest example occurs when &quot;X&quot; is a countable set and μ is a discrete measure. Thus, when &quot;X&quot; = N and μ is counting measure on N, then any sequence {&quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;} of separable Hilbert spaces can be considered as a measurable family. Moreover,

:formula_12

== Decomposable operators ==

For the example of a discrete measure on a countable set, any bounded linear operator &quot;T&quot; on

: formula_13

is given by an infinite matrix

:formula_14

For this example, of a discrete measure on a countable set, &quot;decomposable operators&quot; are defined as the operators that are block diagonal, having zero for all non-diagonal entries. Decomposable operators can be characterized as those which commute with diagonal matrices:

:formula_15

The above example motivates the general definition: A family of bounded operators {&quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot;∈ &quot;X&quot; with &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; ∈ L(&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;) is said to be &quot;strongly measurable&quot; if and only if its restriction to each &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; is strongly measurable. This makes sense because &quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot; is constant on &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

Measurable families of operators with an essentially bounded norm, that is

:formula_16

define bounded linear operators

:formula_17

acting in a pointwise fashion, that is

:formula_18

Such operators are said to be &quot;decomposable&quot;.

Examples of decomposable operators are those defined by scalar-valued (i.e. C-valued) measurable functions λ on &quot;X&quot;. In fact,

Theorem. The mapping

: formula_19

given by

:formula_20

is an involutive algebraic isomorphism onto its image.

This allows &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;) to be identified with the image of φ.

Theorem Decomposable operators are precisely those that are in the operator commutant of the abelian algebra &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;).

=== Decomposition of Abelian von Neumann algebras ===

The spectral theorem has many variants. A particularly powerful version is as follows:

Theorem. For any Abelian von Neumann algebra A on a separable Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, there is a standard Borel space &quot;X&quot; and a measure μ on &quot;X&quot; such that it is unitarily equivalent as an operator algebra to &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;) acting on a direct integral of Hilbert spaces

: formula_21

To assert A is unitarily equivalent to &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;) as an operator algebra means that there is a unitary

:formula_22

such that &quot;U&quot; A &quot;U&quot;* is the algebra of diagonal operators &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;). Note that this asserts more than just the algebraic equivalence of A with the algebra of diagonal operators.

This version of the spectral theorem does not explicitly state how the underlying standard Borel space &quot;X&quot; is obtained. There is a uniqueness result for the above decomposition.

Theorem. If the Abelian von Neumann algebra A is unitarily equivalent to both &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;) and &quot;L&quot;∞ν(&quot;Y&quot;) acting on the direct integral spaces

: formula_23

and μ, ν are standard measures, then there is a Borel isomorphism

:formula_24

where &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; are null sets such that

:formula_25

The isomorphism φ is a measure class isomorphism, in that φ and its inverse preserve sets of measure 0.

The previous two theorems provide a complete classification of Abelian von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces. This classification takes into account the realization of the von Neumann algebra as an algebra of operators. If one considers the underlying von Neumann algebra independently of its realization (as a von Neumann algebra), then its structure is determined by very simple measure-theoretic invariants.

== Direct integrals of von Neumann algebras ==

Let {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; be a measurable family of Hilbert spaces. A family of von Neumann algebras {&quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;
with

:formula_26

is measurable if and only if there is a countable set &quot;D&quot; of measurable operator families that pointwise generate {&quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot;} &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; as a von Neumann algebra in the following sense: For almost all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;,

:formula_27

where W*(&quot;S&quot;) denotes the von Neumann algebra generated by the set &quot;S&quot;. If {&quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; is a measurable family of von Neumann algebras, the direct integral of von Neumann algebras

:formula_28

consists of all operators of the form

:formula_29

for &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot;.

One of the main theorems of von Neumann and Murray in their original series of papers is a proof of the decomposition theorem: Any von Neumann algebra is a direct integral of factors. Precisely stated,

Theorem. If {&quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; is a measurable family of von Neumann algebras and μ is standard, then the family of operator commutants is also measurable and

:formula_30

== Central decomposition ==

Suppose &quot;A&quot; is a von Neumann algebra. Let Z(&quot;A&quot;) be the center of &quot;A&quot;. The center is the set of operators in &quot;A&quot; that commute with all operators &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_31

Then Z(&quot;A&quot;) is an Abelian von Neumann algebra.

Example. The center of L(&quot;H&quot;) is 1-dimensional. In general, if &quot;A&quot; is a von Neumann algebra, if the center is 1-dimensional we say &quot;A&quot; is a factor.

When &quot;A&quot; is a von Neumann algebra whose center contains a sequence of minimal pairwise orthogonal non-zero projections {&quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; ∈ N such that

:formula_32

then &quot;A&quot; &quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a von Neumann algebra on the range &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; of &quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;. It is easy to see &quot;A&quot; &quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a factor. Thus, in this special case

:formula_33

represents &quot;A&quot; as a direct sum of factors. This is a special case of the central decomposition theorem of von Neumann.

In general, the structure theorem of Abelian von Neumann algebras represents Z(A) as an algebra of scalar diagonal operators. In any such representation, all the operators in A are decomposable operators. This can be used to prove the basic result of von Neumann: any von Neumann algebra admits a decomposition into factors.

Theorem. Suppose

:formula_34

is a direct integral decomposition of &quot;H&quot; and A is a von Neumann algebra on &quot;H&quot; so that Z(A) is represented by the algebra of scalar diagonal operators &quot;L&quot;∞μ(&quot;X&quot;) where &quot;X&quot; is a standard Borel space. Then

:formula_35

where for almost all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;x&quot; is a von Neumann algebra that is a &quot;factor&quot;.

== Measurable families of representations ==

If &quot;A&quot; is a separable C*-algebra, the above results can be applied to measurable families of non-degenerate *-representations of &quot;A&quot;. In the case that &quot;A&quot; has a unit, non-degeneracy is equivalent to unit-preserving. By the general correspondence that exists between strongly continuous unitary representations of a locally compact group &quot;G&quot; and non-degenerate *-representations of the groups C*-algebra C*(&quot;G&quot;), the theory for C*-algebras immediately provides a decomposition theory for representations of separable locally compact groups.

Theorem. Let &quot;A&quot; be a separable C*-algebra and π a non-degenerate involutive representation of &quot;A&quot; on a separable Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. Let W*(π) be the von Neumann algebra generated by the operators π(&quot;a&quot;) for &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;. Then corresponding to any central decomposition of W*(π) over a standard measure space (&quot;X&quot;, μ) (which, as stated, is unique in a measure theoretic sense), there is a measurable family of factor representations

:formula_36

of &quot;A&quot; such that

:formula_37

Moreover, there is a subset &quot;N&quot; of &quot;X&quot; with μ measure zero, such that π&quot;x&quot;, π&quot;y&quot; are disjoint whenever &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; − &quot;N&quot;, where representations are said to be &quot;disjoint&quot; if and only if there are no intertwining operators between them.

One can show that the direct integral can be indexed on the so-called &quot;quasi-spectrum&quot; &quot;Q&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, consisting of quasi-equivalence classes of factor representations of &quot;A&quot;. 
Thus, there is a standard measure μ on &quot;Q&quot; and a measurable family of factor representations indexed on &quot;Q&quot; such that π&quot;x&quot; belongs to the class of &quot;x&quot;. This decomposition is essentially unique. This result is fundamental in the theory of group representations.

<text>The Bulgarian Revival (, &quot;Balgarsko vazrazhdane&quot; or simply: Възраждане, &quot;Vazrazhdane&quot;, and ), sometimes called the Bulgarian National Revival, was a period of socio-economic development and national integration among Bulgarian people under Ottoman rule. It is commonly accepted to have started with the historical book, &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot;, written in 1762 by Paisius, a Bulgarian monk of the Hilandar monastery at Mount Athos, leading to the National awakening of Bulgaria and the modern Bulgarian nationalism, and lasting until the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.

==Characteristics==

The period is remarkable for its characteristic architecture which can still be observed in old Bulgarian towns such as Tryavna, Koprivshtitsa and Veliko Tarnovo, the rich literary heritage of authors like Ivan Vazov and Hristo Botev that inspired the Bulgarian struggle for independence and an autonomous church, and the April Uprising of 1876, a significant event of armed opposition to Ottoman rule, which ultimately led to the Russo-Turkish Liberation War of 1877–1878.
The significant changes in the Bulgarian society, the freedom of economic initiative and religious choice led to the formation of the Bulgarian nation in its ethnic borders and common territory embracing the lands of Moesia (including Dobruja), Thrace and Macedonia.

The Bulgarian National Revival is traditionally divided into three periods, the first from the 18th until the beginning of the 19th century (Bulgarian National Awakening), the second from the Ottoman reforms of the 1820s to the 1850s until the Crimean War, and the third from the Crimean War until the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878.

The beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival has been a topic of intensified discussion in the past. According to contemporaries of the period, it began in the 1820s. Later Marin Drinov suggested the actual beginning was marked by the writing of &quot;Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya&quot; by Paisius of Hilendar. According to an even later assumption by Hristo Gandev, the period began in the beginning of the 17th century after the end of the Köprülü era and the beginning of the Tulip period and the rule of the Phanarites. The prevailing opinion in contemporary historiography is that the Bulgarian National Revival&#x27;s beginning is marked by the first clear processes of decomposition in the Ottoman Empire. The April Uprising led to the liberation and the end of the Revival.

It is universally accepted that the Bulgarian National Revival ended with the Liberation of Bulgaria. This is meant only to include the Principality of Bulgaria, as revival processes continued until later in Eastern Rumelia and Macedonia.

<text>David Levy (; 21 December 1937 – 2 June 2024) was an Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset between 1969 and 2006. Levy&#x27;s ascent to political prominence demonstrated the growing influence of Mizrahi Jews in Israel. He played a crucial role in changing the political power structure in Israel by motivating hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi voters to cast their ballots for Menachem Begin. To quote Benjamin Netanyahu, “David, born in Morocco, forged his way through life with his own two hands… On the national level, he made a personal mark on the political world, while taking care of weak populations that knew adversity.”
He served Israel as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Immigrant Absorption, Minister of Housing and Construction, and as a Minister without Portfolio.
Although most of his time as a Knesset member was spent with Likud, he also led the breakaway Gesher faction, which formed part of Ehud Barak&#x27;s Labor-led government between 1999 and 2001.

==Biography==
David Levy was born in Rabat, Morocco. 
Levy was student at the Alliance school and at a Talmud Torah (religious junior school) in Morocco.

He immigrated to Israel in 1957. His first jobs in Israel were planting trees for the Jewish National Fund and picking cotton on a kibbutz, where he organized a strike to protest the quality of drinking water for the workers. He went on to become a leader of Beit She&#x27;an&#x27;s working-class population. As a union activist, he campaigned for membership in the Histadrut Labour Federation&#x27;s executive body, which was dominated by loyalists of the governing Mapai. Levy headed the opposition Blue-White faction.

David Levy was married and the father of twelve children, including Orly Levy and Jackie Levy. He died on 2 June 2024, at the age of 86.

==Political career==
Until 1973 Likud had been an alliance of the right-wing Herut and centrist Liberal parties known as Gahal, which had never had an active role in governing Israel and had always been a weak opposition. Levy distinguished himself as the first of many young working-class members of the party from a &quot;Mizrahi&quot; (Oriental) background. Until then Herut and the Liberals had been both dominated by right-wing upper-class or upper-middle-class intellectuals, businessmen, agriculturalists, or lawyers.

Levy&#x27;s rise expressed the surging power of the new rebellion of the Mizrahi Israeli. In 1977, Levy became one of the most strident campaigners in Likud leader Menachem Begin&#x27;s triumphant campaign that overturned the 30-year domination of Israeli elections by parties of the left. He drove hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi voters to the polls to vote for Begin, whose populist messages struck a chord in their hearts after the three decades of almost completely Ashkenazic Mapai hegemony.

==Ministerial positions==

===Minister of Immigrant Absorption===
From 1977 until 1981, Levy was Minister of Immigrant Absorption in the first two Begin governments. At this time the largest issues he dealt with during his tenure in that ministry were the campaign to liberate Soviet Jews confined to the USSR, and the controversy over the &quot;Beta Israel&quot;, a group from Ethiopia that had still not received total recognition as Jews at that time.

===Minister of Housing and Construction===
On 15 January 1979 he was given the Ministry of Housing and Construction, a post he invested a great deal of time in. Levy held the ministry until 1990. 

As Housing Minister Levy was able to make housing more affordable (radical inflation in 1984 produced a crisis as property and rent values plummeted along with the Israeli shekels). While rival Likud members like Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and Health Minister Ehud Olmert were hit by controversies regarding abuse of their positions, and repeated finance ministers fell, Levy remained stable in the Housing Ministry. He served in this position in the governments of Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and Shimon Peres.

Levy was the symbolic leader of the young Mizrahi Likud leaders that included former Kiryat Malakhi mayor Moshe Katzav, later President of Israel, and David Magen, mayor of neighbouring Kiryat Gat. In the Likud Central Committee, Levy commanded a huge portion of the members, and was considered a true candidate to succeed Shamir.

In 1987, he met Benjamin Netanyahu, then the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Levy viewed Netanyahu as a potential spokesman for him in the Knesset, as he was viewed as a master at rhetoric and debating during his career as a diplomat.

Netanyahu turned down Levy&#x27;s offer and became an ally of then-Defense Minister Moshe Arens (his former boss when Arens was Ambassador to the United States in the early 1980s). Levy was criticized for his perceived pompousness and shifting policies on the peace process. Levy, who speaks Hebrew, French, and Moroccan Arabic, was not fluent in English, which became an impediment in talks with the Americans. Levy&#x27;s candidacy was supposed to rejuvenate the Likud&#x27;s Mizrahi voting base and form a hawkish working class opposition to Labour. Levy&#x27;s policies on the peace question was moderate relative to Ariel Sharon, Moshe Arens, and almost all other senior Likud figures.

Again he ran parallel to Benjamin Netanyahu who took a hard-line stand, describing a doomsday scenario of terror at the doorstep of every Israeli. Levy refused to accept Netanyahu as the new Likud chairman. The result was the establishment of Gesher (&quot;Bridge&quot;), Levy&#x27;s own political party. Levy believed he could draw a mass defection from the Likud of parliament members and topple Benjamin Netanyahu. What occurred was that only David Magen, a Moroccan politician and former mayor of Kiryat Gat who served as Minister of Economics and Planning in the last Shamir government, broke with the Likud. Magen later broke with Levy to join the Center Party in 1998 (then known as &quot;Israel in the Center&quot;).

Netanyahu and Levy agreed to establish Likud–Gesher–Tzomet, a joint three-party list for the May 1996 elections.

===Foreign minister===
Levy first served as Foreign Minister in 1990, under Yitzhak Shamir. Under Ehud Barak, Levy was again appointed foreign minister, with his deputy being Nawaf Mazalha (One Israel), an Arab Israeli. He quit the coalition in April 2000 in response to Barak&#x27;s plan to withdraw Israeli military forces from Lebanon.

Levy was the first minister in Barak&#x27;s government to resign when his demands were not met. He reformed Gesher along with Maxim Levy and rookie legislator Mordechai Mishani. In February 2002 One Nation quit Sharon&#x27;s government to protest his economic policies. Their leader, Histadrut Labour Federation chairman Amir Peretz. Levy&#x27;s position for the elections for the 16th Knesset was precarious. Levy left Gesher and moved back to the Likud. Etty (Estee) Shiraz, the party&#x27;s head of communications at that time, was elected as the head of Gesher instead of David Levy, and led Gesher in the elections to the 16th Knesset. Levy and his supporters objected in the petition to prevent Shiraz and the rest of Gesher members from continuing the party&#x27;s activity, and asked to dissolve the party and relate to his move as a merge of his political party in its entirety. The struggle continued years later, while Shiraz and other members of the party are trying to rebuild Gesher and transform it into a modern social party appealing to Israel&#x27;s young generation of academics and professionals, and David Levy and his supporters seeking to dismantle it.

Levy was elected as a member of the 16th Knesset but did not get a realistic place on the Likud list in the election to the 17th Knesset and disappeared from the political arena. Following the Kadima split, Levy failed to acquire a high position on Likud&#x27;s Knesset list, and as a result of this lost his seat at the 2006 election.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2018, Levy won the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement.

<text> (; &quot;Gorée Island&quot;; ) is one of the 19 (i.e. districts) of the city of Dakar, Senegal. It is an island located at sea from the main harbour of Dakar (), famous as a destination for people interested in the Atlantic slave trade.

Its population as of the 2013 census was 1,680 inhabitants, giving a density of , which is only half the average density of the city of Dakar. Gorée is both the smallest and the least populated of the 19 of Dakar.

Other important centres for the slave trade from Senegal were further north, at Saint-Louis, Senegal, or to the south in the Gambia, at the mouths of major rivers for trade. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was one of the first 12 locations in the world to be designated as such in 1978.

The name is a corruption of its original Dutch name Goeree, named after the Dutch island of Goeree. The island was also known as Palma, or in Portuguese.

==History and slave trade==

Gorée is a small island in length and in width sheltered by the Peninsula. Now part of the city of Dakar, it was a minor port and site of European settlement along the coast.

Being almost devoid of drinking water, the island was not settled before the arrival of Europeans, although the presence of domesticated sheep noted by Portuguese explorers indicates the island was frequented by local peoples of the nearby mainland. The island of Gorée was one of the first places in Africa to be frequented by European traders, as the Portuguese traders established themselves on the island in 1444. According to Valentim Fernandes, the Portuguese established a chapel with dry stone walls and a roof made out of straw on the island. This chapel was visited by Vasco da Gama in 1502 and probably also by Amerigo Vespucci, Tristão da Cunha and Afonso de Albuquerque in 1501 and 1506, respectively.

=== Dutch West India Company rule ===

Due to the destruction of much of the archive of the First Dutch West India Company, it is unknown when and how the Dutch replaced the Portuguese on the island. According to Olfert Dapper, the island was gifted to the Dutch West India Company by the local chief Biram in 1617. This statement is problematic, not the least because the Dutch West India Company was only established in 1621. The first contemporary Dutch account of a landing at Gorée is by Johannes de Laet, who reported that a fleet of Dirck Symonsz van Uytgeest destined for Brazil anchored at Gorée on 20 July 1628. De Laet mentions that the Dutch West India Company had built a fort on the island and had named the island &quot;Goeree&quot;. This could either be after the Dutch island of or, as is the case for the Dutch island itself, be an allusion to the quality of the anchorage at the island, as &quot;goede reede&quot; means &quot;good roadstead&quot; in Dutch.

Possession of Goree was the key to accessing the trade of the entire coast south of the Cap Vert, including the important trading posts at Rufisque, Saly-Portudal, Joal, and Cacheu, in addition to the commerce of the Gambia river, as it served as a warehousing and transshipment point. In addition, it was a convenient stopover on the shortest route from Europe to the Caribbean. Many slaves were shipped through Goree to the Dutch colony of Curaçao in the 1660s and 70s.

The island was attacked by the Portuguese in early 1629, but they were not able to hold it. With this loss, their access to the lucrative coastal trade was cut off, and the importance and wealth of Santiago, Cape Verde, withered. The British also attempted to control this trade, capturing the island with a fleet under Robert Holmes in 1663, but it was soon recaptured by Michiel de Ruyter. Repeated wars weakened the Dutch West India Company, however, and the Third Anglo-Dutch War precipitated the bankruptcy of the company in 1674. In 1677 a French fleet led by Jean d&#x27;Estrées defeated the Dutch and captured Goree and their coastal trading posts.

=== French colonial rule ===
After the French invasion in 1677, during the Franco-Dutch War, the island remained chiefly French until 1960. There were brief periods of British occupation during the various wars fought by France and Britain. The island was notably taken and occupied by the British between 1758 and 1763 following the Capture of Gorée and wider Capture of Senegal during the Seven Years&#x27; War before being returned to France at the Treaty of Paris (1763). For a brief time between 1779 and 1783, Gorée was again under British control, until ceded again to France in 1783 at the Treaty of Paris (1783). During that time, the infamous Joseph Wall served as Lieutenant-Governor there, who had some of his men unlawfully flogged to death in 1782; for these crimes, Wall was later executed in England.

Gorée was principally a trading post, administratively attached to Saint-Louis, capital of the Colony of Senegal. Apart from slaves, beeswax, hides and grain were also traded. The population of the island fluctuated according to circumstances, from a few hundred free Africans and Creoles to about 1,500. There would have been few European residents at any one time.

After the decline of the slave trade from Senegal in the 1770s and 1780s, the town became an important port for the shipment of peanuts, peanut oil, gum arabic, ivory, and other products of the &quot;legitimate&quot; trade. It was probably in relation to this trade that the so-called was built.
In the 18th and 19th century, Gorée was home to a Franco-African Creole, or &quot;Métis&quot;, community of merchants with links to similar communities in Saint-Louis and the Gambia, and across the Atlantic to France&#x27;s colonies in the Americas. Métis women, called from the Portuguese descendants of African women and European traders, were especially important to the city&#x27;s business life. The owned ships and property and commanded male clerks. They were also famous for cultivating fashion and entertainment. One such signare, Anne Rossignol, lived in Saint-Domingue (the modern Haiti) in the 1780s before the Haitian Revolution.

In February 1794 during the French Revolution, France abolished slavery, and the slave trade from Senegal was said to have stopped. A French engraving of about 1797 (pictured) shows it still going on, but this may be an anachronism. In April 1801, Gorée was captured by the British again.

In January 1804 a small French squadron from Curaçao captured Gorée, but the British recaptured it in March.

In March 1815, during his political comeback known as the Hundred Days, Napoleon definitively abolished the slave trade to build relations with Great Britain. This time, abolition continued.

As the trade in slaves declined in the late eighteenth century, Gorée converted to legitimate commerce. The tiny city and port were ill-situated for the shipment of industrial quantities of peanuts, which began arriving in bulk from the mainland. Consequently, its merchants established a presence directly on the mainland, first in (1840) and then in Dakar (1857). Many of the established families started to leave the island.

Civic franchise for the citizens of Gorée was institutionalized in 1872, when it became a French with an elected mayor and a municipal council. , the first African deputy elected to the French National Assembly (served 1914 to 1934), was born on Gorée. From a peak of about 4,500 in 1845, the population fell to 1,500 in 1904. In 1940 Gorée was annexed to the municipality of Dakar.

From 1913 to 1938, Gorée was home to the , a government teachers&#x27; college run by the French Colonial Government. Many of the school&#x27;s graduates would one day lead the struggle for independence from France. In 1925 African-American historian, sociologist, and Pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois wrote of the school &quot;On the picturesque island of Goree whose ancient ramparts face modern and commercial Dakar I saw two or three hundred fine black boys of high school rank gathered in from all Senegal by competitive tests and taught thoroughly by excellent French teachers in accordance with a curriculum which, as far as it went, was equal to that of any European school,&quot; while faulting Colonial France for how limited its public education infrastructure was in the country overall and expressing pessimism about further investment.

=== Post-independence ===
Gorée is connected to the mainland by regular 30-minute ferry service, for pedestrians only; there are no cars on the island. Senegal&#x27;s premier tourist site, the island was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978. It now serves mostly as a memorial to the slave trade. Many of the historic commercial and residential buildings have been turned into restaurants and hotels to support the tourist traffic.

Gorée is known as the location of the House of Slaves (), built by an Afro-French Métis family about 1780–1784. The House of Slaves is one of the oldest houses on the island. It is now used as a tourist destination to show the horrors of the slave trade throughout the Atlantic world. As discussed by historian Ana Lucia Araujo, the building started gaining reputation as a slave depot mainly because of the work of its curator , who was able to move the audiences who visited the house with his performance. Many public personalities visit the House of Slaves, which plays the role of a site of memory of slavery. In June 2013, President of the United States Barack Obama visited the building.

The Dakar-Gorée Swim was launched in 1985 as a homage to the victims of slavery who displayed resilience by attempting to swim towards freedom. It has been a recurring event throughout its history, except in 2020 and 2021 when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Administration==

With the foundation of Dakar in 1857, Gorée gradually lost its importance. In 1872, the French colonial authorities created the two communes of Saint-Louis and Gorée, the first western-style municipalities in West Africa, with the same status as any commune in France. Dakar, on the mainland, was part of the commune of Gorée, whose administration was located on the island. However, as early as 1887, Dakar was detached from the commune of Gorée and was turned into a commune in its own right. Thus, the commune of Gorée became limited to its tiny island.

In 1891, Gorée still had 2,100 inhabitants, while Dakar only had 8,737 inhabitants. However, by 1926 the population of Gorée had declined to only 700 inhabitants, while the population of Dakar had increased to 33,679 inhabitants. Thus, in 1929 the commune of Gorée was merged with Dakar. The commune of Gorée disappeared, and Gorée was now only a small island of the commune of Dakar.

In 1996, a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, was divided into 19 to which extensive powers were given. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19 . It coordinates the activities of the , much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs.

Thus, in 1996 the of Gorée was resurrected, although it is now only a (but in fact with powers quite similar to a ). The new of Gorée (officially, the ) took possession of the old (town hall) in the center of the island. This had been used as the of the former commune of Gorée between 1872 and 1929.

The of Gorée is ruled by a municipal council () democratically elected every 5 years, and by a mayor elected by members of the municipal council.

The current mayor of Gorée is Augustin Senghor, elected in 2002.

== Archaeology of Gorée Island ==
The island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, since September 1978. Most of the main buildings in Gorée were constructed during the second half of the eighteenth century. The main buildings are the Slave house, 1786; William Ponty School, 1770; (Maritime museum), 1835; , originally called the northern battery, which now contains the Historical Museum of Senegal, built between 1852 and 1865; (Government Palace), 1864, occupied by the first governor-general of Senegal from 1902 to 1907. The Gorée Castle and the seventeenth-century Gorée Police Station, formerly a dispensary, believed to be the site of the first chapel built by the Portuguese in the fifteenth century, and the beach are also of interest to tourists. 

This historical site is a rare example of a European colony where we see free and enslaved Africans (making up half of Gorée&#x27;s population), Europeans and Afro-Europeans living alongside each other, even as the island was a prominent center in the Atlantic slave trade. Archaeology on Gorée Island leads to many contradictory and contrasting conclusions. On one end of the spectrum, enslaved peoples on Gorée were treated poorly, like animals, on the other there is evidence for enslaved peoples being welcomed as part of families. The (free African or Afro-European women) were recorded preferring to eat on the floor with a spoon and communal bowl, as their domestic slaves, but European men kept tradition and used a table.

Archaeological research on Gorée has been undertaken by Dr Ibrahima Thiaw (Associate Professor of Archaeology at the ; and the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal); Dr Susan Keech McIntosh (Professor of Archaeology, Rice University, Houston, Texas); and Raina Croff (PhD candidate at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut). Dr Shawn Murray (University of Wisconsin–Madison) also contributed to archaeological research at Gorée through a study of local and introduced trees and shrubs, which aids in identifying the ancient plant remains found in the excavations. Excavations at Gorée have also uncovered numerous European imports: bricks, nails, bottles from alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and other liquor, beads, ceramics and gunflints.

=== Gorée Archaeological Project ===
The Gorée Archaeological Project, or GAP, started its undertakings (survey, testing, mapping, and excavations) in 2001. The project, extending over a period of several years, aimed to collect artifacts pertaining to the historical time periods of the pre- and post- European settlement, as well as identify the use of the different quarters on the island using the material culture excavated from those areas. In his preliminary results, Ibrahima Thiaw also discusses the difficulties of excavation on a primarily tourist island.

=== Background ===

Portuguese Major Captain and his crew were the first to make Afro-European relations with Gorée Island in 1445. After sighting Gorée approximately off the shore from modern day Dakar, Senegal, and his officers sent ashore a few officers to leave peace offerings to the natives of the island. They deposited on Gorée soil a cake, a mirror and a piece of paper with a cross drawn on it, all of which were intended to be symbols for peaceful actions. However, the Africans did not respond in the desired way and tore up the paper and smashed the cake and the mirror, thus setting the tone for future relations between the Portuguese and Africans of Gorée Island.

As of the early 18th century, Gorée settlements were segregated into quarters: the Bambara quarter (slaves), (Christianized Africans), and a quarter for the residents of Gorée, including free Africans. By the later half of the 18th century, the segregation was between and their families and the rest of the island as well as the previous instated quarters.

=== Pre-European settlement ===
According to preliminary results by Ibrahim Thiaw, the levels between the pre and post European contact deposits were characterized by an obvious infestation of termite nests. One interpretation of this is the possibility that these termite nests were cause of the abandonment of Gorée before Dutch arrival.

Deposits of the pre-European period are dense with pottery decorated with twine and fish vertebrae motifs and could be found in the domestic settlement context, under or at the same levels of floors and fireplaces. The pottery near the settlements suggests that these settlements were semi-permanent or permanent. Fishing tools and equipment were rare although deposits were dense with fish remains. There was also no sign of iron or its usage before the eighteenth century.

Due to a plethora of features containing ritual pots found in the core of the pre European settlement, Thiaw has concluded that the island may have been primarily used for ritual activity and practices. Nevertheless, abandonment is archaeologically evident by the middle of the fifteenth century, possibly due to a mighty termite invasion. There is no archaeological or physical evidence of a struggle or conflict between the eventual Europeans or any other cultural group. Thiaw&#x27;s hypothesis suggest the possibility that when the Portuguese used the island to bury their dead, the island, in the eyes of the natives, became haunted or was negatively impacted by the mysterious powers of the spirits of the sea.

=== European settlement ===
There is some textual evidence that states that the Dutch purchased the island from the chief of Dakar or from local fisherman on the island. While there is little archaeological evidence of this transaction, all European deposits are relatively abundant. On Gorée there are four distinct deposits found through excavation and testing. The first kinds of deposition are located on the northwestern and western part of the island, and were typically three metres of domestic debris and shell midden. Surrounding the area that was once Fort Nassau, these depositions were determined in correlation with Fort Nassau activity, which was seen to be relatively unfluctuating.

A rare deposition was found near the Castel at G18, the sole site excavated in the area. Depositions in this area were typically shallow and right on top of a limestone bedrock. However, this one site produced three burials, all of which were dug into the limestone bedrock.

G13, a site located on the eastern side of the island, has produced cultural debris from one of its trash pits. This debris includes nails, European late pearlware and early whiteware with similar patterns dating from 1810 to 1849, sardine cans, and window glass, among other artifacts. Located near the military barracks from a military occupation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the analysis of these ceramics suggests that many of them were replacements coinciding with the occupation. Deposits like this were not common around the island.

As with many archaeological sites around the globe, modern influences and activities affect the sites and lead to disturbances in the archaeological record or unintentional site destruction. The European government imposed strict rules regarding the use of space and overall settlement development on the island. Archaeology shows this development in the soil; the constructions, levelling, reconstructions, some of which can be linked to a change in the European ruler at the time. However, this evidence of development too show results of the consequences from contemporary activity, thus it is an intricate puzzle to determine complex social identities and groups, such as slave or free or African or Afro-European. An overall deduction can be made however: Atlantic trade significantly impacts the lives of those on Gorée, seen in the influx of ideas, complex identities and settlement structure.

Atlantic trade also influenced the physiological aspects of Gorean society. Archaeology has uncovered a plethora of evidence for massive imports of alcoholic beverages on the island. The massive import of alcoholic beverages naturally suggests a high level of consumption which its effects have been recorded as drunken conflicts, commonly between the military inhabitants. The previously mentioned Dr Ibrahima Thiaw is also the author of &quot;Digging on Contested Grounds: Archaeology and the Commemoration of Slavery on Gorée Island&quot;. In this article, Thiaw discusses the difference between the historical accounts full of slavery and shackles and the lack of archaeological evidence to support those accounts. Raina Croff, one of Thiaw&#x27;s colleagues, states that she personally has never found any evidence of slavery on Gorée Island, however she also includes that archaeological evidence such as shackles and chains would not be found on an island, because there is no need.


, or the House of Slaves, was built in 1780–1784 by . Although it is the home of the infamous &quot;Door of No Return&quot;, which is said to be the last place exported slaves touched African soil for the rest of their lives, there is little evidence at to suggest a &quot;large-scale trans-Atlantic slave trade&quot; economy. According to census records obtained from the 18th century, the majority of enslaved population fell under the category of domestic slaves, rather than slaves to be exported. and his heiress may have had domestic slaves, but again there is little archaeological evidence that they were involved in any slave exportation business. Despite this lack of evidence, has become a pilgrimage site to commemorate forcible removal of Africans from their homeland, also known as the African diaspora. This contrasts with the role of the site of on Gorée. At , as the name suggests, there is a presence of dungeons, which can clearly be associated with the confinement of the slaves to be exported. Historian Ana Lucia Araujo has said &quot;it’s not a real place from where real people left in the numbers they say.&quot; Conversely, UNESCO claims that &quot;from the 15th to 19th century, Gorée was the largest slave trading centre on the African coast.&quot;
==== Bambara Quartier ====
On the southcentral end of Gorée, in the Bambara quarter, although less abundant in artifacts, the deposits from this area differ in sediment inclusions from the rest of the island. Inclusions such as limestone, red bricks, shell, or stones in these two to three meter depositions are no older than the eighteenth century and shows frequent building up and tearing down processes. This could be correlated to the extensive settlement of this area maybe by domestic slaves beginning in the eighteenth century. Quartier Bambara was a segregated settlement, which suggests domestic slavery rather than exportation. The maps of this settlement has segregated boundary lines that eventually, by the mid-eighteenth century, were shown to be reduced. Found in the center of the island, Bambara was inhabited by the Bambara people. The Bambara people had an unfavorable stereotype; found in the mainland of Senegal and Mali, the Bambara were known for being excellent slaves. Brought to Gorée by the French, the Bambara people were set to build roads, forts and houses.

These buildings (, , and ), made of stone or brick, contrasted with the structures built by the Africans made of straw and mud. This contrast aided in the segregation and status separation between the Africans and the European inhabitants and followed the common association that masonry was a European influence. However, the construction of these architectural buildings were most likely built by the slaves, and without floor plans, as indicated by the haphazard city layout and irregular angles in the rooms. Settlement analysis demonstrates the possibility that with time, the masters&#x27; and the enslaved peoples&#x27; statuses evened out enough to work and live side by side on the island by the second half of the eighteenth century.

== Disputing Gorée as a &quot;major&quot; trading post for slaves ==

In the 1990s a debate ensued on the veracity of the Gorée slave trade as narrated by the conservator . In an article, published in the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Emmanuel de Roux challenged Ndiaye&#x27;s repeated claims that Gorée, at the so-called &quot;Maison des Esclaves&quot;, was an important slave depot (which was largely based on the false interpretations of French visitors in the 18–19th century and afterwards). De Roux based his critique on the works of the researchers Abdoulaye Camara and Father Joseph-Roger de Benoist. According to historical accounts, no more than 500 slaves per year were traded there, a trickle in comparison to the scale of the slave trade along the coasts of modern-day Benin, Guinee and Angola: in total 4–5% (or around 500 000) of the slaves were shipped from Senegal to the Americas, whereas the remaining 11.5 million enslaved Africans came from the other (West) African shores. Ndiaye&#x27;s graphic descriptions of the conditions of the slaves allegedly kept at the &quot;Maison des Esclaves&quot; are not supported by any historical documentation and according to De Roux, they may have served to drum up business, especially from African-American tourists. In response to these accusations, several Senegalese and European researchers convened a symposium at the Sorbonne in April 1997, entitled &quot;Gorée dans la traite atlantique : mythes et réalités&quot;, whose proceedings were published afterwards.

Recently, Hamady Bocoum et Bernard Toulier published an article &quot;The Fabrication of Heritage: the case of Gorée (Senegal)&quot; (in French: &quot;La fabrication du Patrimoine : l’exemple de Gorée (Sénégal)&quot;) documenting the elevation of Gorée to an emotionally charged memorial of the transatlantic slave trade for touristic reasons. This was spearheaded by the Senegalese government, begun under President Léopold Sédar Senghor, who had tasked his special appointee Ndiaye with this goal. In 2013, journalist Jean Luc Angrand chronicled how Ndiaye began his lobbying campaign among African-American communities in the US, as he tried to capitalize on their desire to look for their own heritage in Africa that arose in the 1970s. This interest surged after the impact of the TV series &quot;Roots&quot;, which was most acutely felt among African-American viewers. For this reason Ndiaye exaggerated the importance of Senegal, and Gorée in particular, by claiming that no less than 20 million enslaved Africans were shipped from there.

Although several English-written media sources have reported on the invented history of Gorée, notably John Murphy in the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; and Max Fischer in the &quot;Washington&quot; &quot;Post&quot;, some English news sources, such as the BBC, still cling to the invented narrative of Gorée as a major center of the slave trade.

== Notable residents ==

* Latyr Sy, djembe musician
* France Gall, the French singer, owned a home there
* Léa Seydoux, was partially raised on the island

==In popular culture==
Gorée Island was the Pit Stop for Leg 4 of &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot;, and the Slave House itself was visited during Leg 5.

Gorée Island has been featured in many songs, due to its history related to the slave trade. The following songs have significant references to Gorée Island:
* Steel Pulse– &quot;Door Of No Return&quot; on &quot;African Holocaust&quot; (2004)
* Doug E. Fresh– &quot;Africa&quot;
* Akon – &quot;Senegal&quot;
* Burning Spear– &quot;One Africa&quot; on &quot;Jah Is Real&quot; (2008)
* Alpha Blondy &amp; Solar System– &quot;Goree (Senegal)&quot; on &quot;Dieu&quot; (1994)
* Nuru Kane – &quot;Goree&quot;
* Sinsemilia - &quot;De l’histoire&quot;
* Gilberto Gil – &quot;, composed by Gilberto Gil and José Carlos Capinam
* The father of French rapper Booba (born Elie Yaffa) is from Gorée. In his song &quot; he mentions the island, saying &quot;&quot; (Gorée is my land/hometown). Also, in his song &quot;0.9&quot;, he says &quot;&quot; (When I was 10 I saw Gorée, since then my tears have been eternal.&quot;
* Marcus Miller – &quot;Gorée (Go-ray)&quot; 
In 2007 the Swiss director made a documentary called &quot;Retour à Gorée&quot; (&quot;Return to Gorée&quot;).

Greek avantgarde classical composer Iannis Xenakis wrote a piece for harpsichord and ensemble entitled &quot;A l`ile de Gorée&quot; (1986).

<text>Privileged partnership is a generic term for increased cooperation between the European Union and a non-EU country to advance common goals, often without pursuing EU membership.

==History==
The term was initially used to describe an alternative to EU membership for Turkey that was first floated in November 2002 by Heinrich August Winkler in Die Zeit and later formally proposed in 2004, although the term was used previously in 2003 to describe a proposed relationship with Russia and was also used in 2004 for a proposed relationship with Israel. 

Since that time, the term has been used for alternatives for EU membership for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. It has since been used retrospectively to characterize relationships with the countries considered in 2004 for the European Neighbourhood Policy that were first proposed in the Commission Communication of March 2003, and is also used for the EU&#x27;s bilateral relationship with Tunisia and with Russia. 

Ultimately, the term dates back to 1957 when it was used to characterize Morocco&#x27;s relationship with the European Economic Community.

<text>Stefanie Powers (born November 2, 1942) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Jennifer Hart on the mystery television series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (1979–1984), for which she received nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards.

==Early life==
Powers was born on November 2, 1942, in Hollywood as Stefania Zofya Paul, but her surname often was cited as Federkiewicz. In her Polish-language autobiography, Powers says, &quot;&quot;, which translates to, &quot;My real [Polish] name is Federkiewicz&quot;. At the age of 16, she was put under studio contract with Columbia Pictures, and as was the movie-industry custom in those days, her name change to the more Anglo-Saxon-sounding &quot;Stefanie Powers&quot; was made a part of the deal.

Her parents divorced during her childhood. Powers&#x27; father, Morrison Bloomfield Paul (1909–1993), reportedly a cinematographer, was born in Montreal to a Jewish immigrant family from Eastern Europe. Powers was estranged from her father, whom she barely refers to and whose name is never mentioned in her memoir &quot;One from the Hart&quot;, in which she refers to the &quot;tension and unhappiness created by my father&#x27;s presence&quot;. She remained very close throughout her life to her mother, who was born Juliana Dimitria Golan (1912–2009) on a farm near Middletown, New York to Catholic parents of Polish descent. Her mother, who died in Los Angeles from pneumonia at 96 years of age, was known late in life and in local obituaries as Julie Powers. Stefanie Powers had an older brother, Jeffrey Julian Paul (1940–2013), of Orangevale, California, as well as a half-sister, Diane Pascoe Hanson Baillie, who died in 2000. Powers was a cheerleader at Hollywood High School. For a time, one of her schoolmates was Nancy Sinatra, who later graduated from University High School (Los Angeles), in June 1958.

==Career==
In 1961, using the stage name &quot;Taffy Paul&quot;, Powers made Tom Laughlin″s independent film &quot;The Young Sinner&quot;, released in 1965.
Powers appeared in secondary roles in several movies in the early 1960s, such as &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; (1962), &quot;If a Man Answers&quot; (1962), and &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963). She played a schoolgirl in &quot;Tammy Tell Me True&quot; (1961), and Bunny, the police chief&#x27;s daughter, in &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; (1963). She appeared in the 1962 hospital melodrama &quot;The Interns&quot; and its sequel &quot;The New Interns&quot; in 1964. In 1965, she played opposite Tallulah Bankhead in &quot;Die! Die! My Darling&quot; (originally released in the UK as &quot;Fanatic&quot;).
In 1966, her &quot;tempestuous&quot; good looks led to being cast in the starring role as the passive and demure April Dancer, in the short-lived television series &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; Shortly after the series&#x27; debut, she was featured on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; (December 31, 1966 – January 6, 1967). The article mentions her &quot;117-pound frame is kept supple with 11 minutes of Royal Canadian Air Force exercises every morning... Unlike her fellow U.N.C.L.E. agents, the ladylike April is not required to kill the bad guys. Her feminine charms serve as the bait, while her partner Noel Harrison provides the fireworks.&quot; The series lasted for only one season (29 one-hour episodes), airing from September 16, 1966, to April 11, 1967.

In 1967, Powers appeared in &quot;Warning Shot&quot; with David Janssen. Her 1970s movies include &quot;The Boatniks&quot; (1970), &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (a sequel to &quot;The Love Bug&quot;) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven Ride!&quot; (1972). She was a guest star in the Robert Wagner series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; in 1970. The two co-starred in the popular &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; series nine years later. Before success with &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, she starred in &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot; as Toni &quot;Feather&quot; Danton, a successful lawyer, whose father, Harry Danton, was a smooth-talking ex-con man (played by Harold Gould). It ran for a half-season (13 episodes).
Powers&#x27; many guest roles in other popular TV shows include &quot;Lancer&quot; (1969), &quot;McCloud&quot; (1971), &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1972), &quot;Banacek&quot; (1972), &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1974), &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (1975), &quot;Three for the Road&quot; (1975), &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1976), &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976), and &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; (1977). Powers appeared in these shows long after she signed a contract with Universal Studios in 1970. Coincidentally, her longtime friend and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; series co-star Wagner signed a contract with Universal, but did not guest-star in more shows than Powers did.

In 1977, Powers played Sally Whalen in the six-part television miniseries &quot;&quot;, produced by Paramount Television. It is based on John Ehrlichman&#x27;s book &quot;The Company&quot;, a novel inspired by the author&#x27;s time with the Nixon administration. The series had Powers cast with a strong cast, including Cliff Robertson, Jason Robards, Robert Vaughn, Lois Nettleton and John Houseman.

In 1978, Powers starred with Paul Clemens and Brian Dennehy in the TV movie &quot;A Death in Canaan&quot;, directed by Tony Richardson. This TV movie was a dramatization of the nonfictional account of Connecticut townspeople rising to the defense of a local teenager charged with the mutilation murder of his mother in September 1973. Powers portrayed Joan Barthel, a freelance‐writer who brought attention to the original case. Clemens, son of actress Eleanor Parker, made his film acting debut here. The TV movie also marked the American TV directing debut of Richardson, and was Emmy Award-nominated as Outstanding Special of the 1977–78 season.

In 1978, Powers and Stacy Keach were the leads in the stage play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; in a season at the Central Theater in the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center. Directed by Rae Allen, the production was part of an eight-month Long Beach Theater Festival program. The stage production was intended to transfer to Broadway after its California season; however, the bi-coastal run was not extended due to the 1978 New York City newspaper strike of 88 days, which hindered all theatre advertising and reduced box-office sales of the new fall season.

In 1979, Powers starred with Roger Moore, Telly Savalas, David Niven, Sonny Bono and Elliott Gould, in the British adventure feature film &quot;Escape to Athena&quot;, in which a group of Anglo-American prisoners of the Germans scramble to liberate themselves and some Greek art treasures. The production was filmed on location in the Dodecanese islands of Greece in 1978. This was Powers’ last theatrical film until &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; in 2019, in which she played performance artist Ada Risi.

Powers became most widely known as a television star for her role as Jennifer Hart in the American mystery series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, with Robert Wagner as Jonathan Hart, in which they portray a married couple who continually get mixed up in mysterious and/or criminal occurrences that they then solve usually without the assistance of the police. &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; aired for five seasons from 1979 to 1984. Powers and Wagner later reunited for eight &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; TV movies in the 1990s.

In 1984, she starred in the TV mini-series &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, based on Judith Krantz&#x27;s novel.

In 1985, Powers starred as twins who swap places leading to dire consequences in the two-part TV movie &quot;Deceptions&quot;.

In 1987, she starred in the real-life TV drama &quot;At Mother&#x27;s Request&quot; as the frightening Frances Schreuder, who goaded her 17-year-old-son into killing her father. The script was adapted for television by Richard DeLong Adams and aired on CBS, directed by Michael Tuchner.

Powers starred with John Barrowman in &quot;Matador&quot;, a 1991 London stage musical, at the Queen&#x27;s Theater. with a book inspired by Spanish corrida legend El Cordobés. The production was staged by Elijah Moshinsky for producer Laurence Myers, with choreography by Arlene Phillips and Rafael Aguilar, and scenery by William Dudley.

Powers starred with Robert Wagner in the 1993 stage production &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the Chicago Theatre. The two portrayed Melissa Gardner and Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, telling the story of their 40-year, mostly long-distance relationship without getting up from their chairs.

In 1996, Powers toured as Margo Channing in a production of &quot;Applause&quot;, with hopes of a Broadway revival, which did not materialize.

Powers toured the UK in 2002 playing Anna Leonowens in a revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;, and toured the U.S. in 2004 and 2005 in the same role.

Powers released her debut music CD in 2003, titled &quot;On The Same Page&quot;. The album features selections from the classic Great American Songbook era.

Since 2006, she has been the U.S. location guest-host presenter of the long-running &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; panel show.

In 2001, she appeared in the BBC&#x27;s popular long-running British medical drama &quot;Doctors&quot; as Jane Powers, a wealthy businesswoman, and the mother of Dr. Caroline Powers (Jacqueline Leonard). Jane Powers, after being widowed, was due to marry her much younger fiancé David Wilde, but in the lead-up to the wedding, her daughter and fiancé David fell in love and ran off together. Her last appearance was on June 1, 2001.

On April 30, 2008, she was reunited with Wagner for the filming of a special &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; edition of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;.

Powers was a contestant in the reality TV show &quot;11th series of I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, in which celebrities retreat into the jungle. She was the first celebrity to be eliminated on November 25, 2011.

Powers started a tour of &quot;Looped&quot;, a stage play about her former co-star Tallulah Bankhead in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on February 26, 2013.

Powers starred in the musical &quot;Gotta Dance&quot;, which premiered in Chicago in December 2015 through January 2016. The show also starred Georgia Engel, Lillias White, and Andre DeShields. The musical was directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, with a book by Chad Beguelin and Bob Martin, and the score by Matthew Sklar and Nell Benjamin.

In November 2017, it was announced that Powers had joined the cast for a developmental reading of &quot;Love Affair&quot;, a musical with book, music and lyrics by Joseph J. Simeone, based on the 1939 film of the same name. The developmental reading of the musical is being produced by Open Jar Productions as part of their New Works Initiative on November 17, 2017, for an industry-only presentation at the Pershing Square Signature Center.

In 2018, Powers co-starred in the feature film &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; alongside lead actors Bruce Dern and Lena Olin.

<text>Glengoyne distillery is a whisky distillery continuously in operation since its founding in 1833 at Dumgoyne, north of Glasgow, Scotland. Glengoyne is unique in producing Highland single malt whisky matured in the Lowlands. Located upon the Highland Line, the division between the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland, Glengoyne’s stills are in the Highlands while maturing casks of whisky rest across the road in the Lowlands.

==History==

===Illicit stills===
In the early 19th century, due to the heavy taxes on spirit production imposed by the government, many whisky producers were forced to operate illegally. The area around Glengoyne was full of hills and forests which provided excellent cover for the distillers. Records show that at least eighteen illicit whisky stills were operating in the area.

In the 1820s an act of Parliament was passed, which reduced the cost of the licence required to distil, and the duty payable on spirit sales. Shortly after the introduction of the Excise Act 1823 (or &#x27;Walsh Act&#x27;) the first of these illicit stills came into official existence, with Glengoyne following later in 1833. Although Glengoyne only officially existed from 1833 and no records exist from before this date, it is believed that distilling on the site pre-dates that with a local historian writing that the smoke of &quot;illicit stills&quot; was visible in the area in the early 19th century.

===Whisky production===
The distillery began distilling in 1833 and was known as the &quot;Burnfoot distillery&quot;. It was originally owned by George Connell who built the distillery and took out a lease on the surrounding land, on which was built a warehouse which is still in use today. In 1876 the distillery was sold, by Archiball G. MacLellen, to the Lang Brothers who were based in Glasgow. It is stated that the Langs intended to name the distillery &quot;Glengoyne&quot;, but due to a mistake by a clerk it was recorded as &quot;Glen Guin&quot;. In 1894, or 1905 it was changed to &quot;Glengoyne&quot; which comes from &#x27;Glenguin&#x27; or &#x27;Glen of the Wild Geese&#x27;.

The distillery remained with the Lang Brothers until taken over by the Robertson &amp; Baxter Group in 1965, who later became the Edrington Group. In 1966 and 1967 the number of stills was increased from two to three as the distillery underwent a rebuilding project.

In 1984 the Lang Brothers became suppliers of whiskies to the then Queen Mother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s household. The Royal Warrant has since been delegated to Ian Macleod and is featured on all Glengoyne products.

=== Modern era and expansion ===
In April 2003, Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd. acquired Glengoyne Distillery, and the &#x27;Glengoyne Single Malt&#x27; and &#x27;Langs Blended Whisky&#x27; brands. The acquisition of Glengoyne Distillery meant that Ian Macleod became a fully integrated distiller, blender and bottler. Under Ian Macleod, Glengoyne saw a vast increase in output capacity as well as a similar rise in sales.
Speaking of the acquisition and planned expansions in 2003, Leonard Russell, managing director for Ian Macleod stated &quot;We&#x27;ll be aiming to increase sales of the Glengoyne from the current level of 450,000 litres to one million litres next year&quot;.
Later, speaking in 2005 Russell stated &quot;we continue to make whisky exactly the same way at Glengoyne&quot;.
The original warehouse built by George Connell is still on the site, as the shop and visitor reception area. Today, Glengoyne has eight working warehouses with a total capacity of nearly two million litres (4.5 million bottles) or spirit.

==Production and character==
Glengoyne Distillery is situated at Dumgoyne, on the south-western edge of the Scottish Highlands, close to Loch Lomond and to the north of Glasgow. Although distilled in the Highlands, making Glengoyne a Highland single malt, the whisky is matured in the Lowlands. This is because the distillery itself sits upon the Highland Line, the division between the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland which splits the distillery in two. The boundary line runs underneath the A81 road from Glasgow to Aberfoyle and passes in front of the distillery with the warehouses located to the southwest of the road. Glengoyne is located immediately adjacent the West Highland Way, the most popular long walk in Scotland, and regularly enjoys visits from hikers.

Glengoyne is regularly referred to as the &quot;most beautiful distillery in Scotland&quot;. The distillery has been in continuous operation producing Highland single malt whisky for over 175 years with a current distilling capacity of over one million litres of alcohol and over 35,000 visitors per annum.

Glengoyne and Bruichladdich, is one of only two distilleries remaining today that uses Golden Promise barley, which is low in yield but high in quality. The distillery&#x27;s water supply comes from the Glengoyne Burn which flows from the nearby Dumgoyne hill into the distillery grounds before continuing on to Loch Lomond.

Unlike many malt whiskies, Glengoyne does not use peat smoke to dry their barley but instead favours the use of warm air. The clear and bright appearance and distinctive flavour of the Glengoyne single malts are credited to this lack of peat smoke. This rare characteristic is utilised in the marketing of Glengoyne with the use of the promotional slogan &quot;The authentic taste of malt whisky untainted by peat smoke&quot;.

As a result of the use of unpeated malt Glengoyne has been noted as being stylistically closer to a Lowland single malt as opposed to a Highland single malt.

==Products==
At its current operating capacity Glengoyne produces over one million litres of pure spirit (new make spirit) every year which is used in a number of different whiskies.
The distillery has won various awards for its products including a double gold awarded to the 17-year-old Single Malt at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and a gold for the 15-year-old Scottish oak wood finish for &quot;best wood finish&quot; by the Stockholm Beer and Whisky Festival. Glengoyne 17-year-old was voted &quot;World&#x27;s Best Single Highland Malt&quot; in the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; whisky tasting, organised by &quot;Whisky Magazine&quot;.

Due to the rapid growth recently of the Scotch malt whisky industry (recent figures indicate a 9% growth in 2002) and of the premium whisky market as a whole, Glengoyne is mainly marketed in the UK, Scandinavian, French, German and USA markets.

<text>The Topic-based Vector Space Model (TVSM) (literature: ) extends the vector space model of information retrieval by removing the constraint that the term-vectors be orthogonal. The assumption of orthogonal terms is incorrect regarding natural languages which causes problems with synonyms and strong related terms. This facilitates the use of stopword lists, stemming and thesaurus in TVSM.
In contrast to the generalized vector space model the TVSM does not depend on concurrence-based similarities between terms. 

==Definitions==
The basic premise of TVSM is the existence of a &quot;d&quot; dimensional space &quot;R&quot; with only positive axis intercepts, i.e. &quot;R in R+&quot; and &quot;d in N+&quot;. Each dimension of &quot;R&quot; represents a fundamental topic. A term vector &quot;t&quot; has a specific weight for a certain &quot;R&quot;. To calculate these weights assumptions are made taking into account the document contents. Ideally important terms will have a high weight and stopwords and irrelevants terms to the topic will have a low weight. The TVSM document model is obtained as a sum of term vectors representing terms in the document. The similarity between two documents &quot;Di&quot; and &quot;Dj&quot; is defined as the scalar product of document vectors.

==Enhanced Topic-based Vector Space Model==
The enhancement of the Enhanced Topic-based Vector Space Model (eTVSM) (literature: ) is a proposal on how to derive term vectors from an Ontology. Using a synonym Ontology created from WordNet Kuropka shows good results for document similarity. If a trivial Ontology is used the results are similar to Vector Space model.

<text>Axa S.A. is a French multinational insurance corporation headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. It also provides investment management and other financial services via its subsidiaries. As of 2024, it is the fourth largest financial services company by revenue in France, and the 8th largest French company.

The Axa Group operates primarily in Western Europe, North America, the Indian Pacific region, and the Middle East, with a presence in Africa as well. It is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. In 2023, the company was ranked 48th in the Forbes Global 2000.

==Name==
Despite being written by the company in upper case, &quot;AXA&quot; is not an acronym. It was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group&#x27;s desire for an international presence. Initially, &quot;Elan&quot; was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because &quot;elan&quot; is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name Axa.

==History==
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L&#x27;assurance contre L&#x27;incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle). It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies. In 1982, it merged with the Drouot Group, owned by the Hottinguer family, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot.

The firm adopted the Axa name in 1985. Axa took over The Equitable in 1991 and bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France&#x27;s largest insurer, in 1996 to become Axa-UAP. It reverted to the name Axa in 1999. In February 1999, Axa acquired Guardian Royal Exchange. In May 2000, it acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life &amp; Provincial Holdings. On 14 June 2006, Axa acquired Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion. As of 2011, Axa was the second most powerful transnational corporation in terms of corporate control over global financial stability.

In May 2016, the firm announced that it would stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off. On 12 September 2018, Axa acquired XL Group Ltd., a Bermuda-based property and casualty commercial lines insurer and reinsurer, for $15.3 billion. In October 2019, the company sold Axa Bank Belgium to Crelan for €620 million (US$688.51 million).

In 2019, AXA partially disinvested from the Israeli arms group Elbit Systems following pressure from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. The move followed several years of campaigning by NGOs, including an April 2018 petition launched by SumOfUs that received 140,000 signatures, leading AXA to “quietly reduce” its investments in Elbit and Israeli banks. AXA remains indirectly invested in Elbit and Israeli banks through a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary Alliance Bernstein.

In 2023, AXA has increased investments in Israel as a shareholder in three Israeli banks known to support the Israeli occupation of the West Bank: Bank Hapoalim (US$9.99M), Bank Leumi (US$6M), and Israel Discount Bank (US$3.4M). By August 2024, however, AXA had completed a &quot;full divestment&quot; from all three banks, according an analysis by ethical-investing advocacy group Ekō.

In February 2023, the company sold a 7.94% stake in Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) to institutional investors. The package included approximately 100,000,000 MPS shares at a price of €2.33 ($2.5) per share, for a total transaction value of €233 million ($250 million). Axa retained 0.0007% of the Italian bank&#x27;s capital.

Axa Investment Managers acquired France&#x27;s Bry-sur-Marne film studio and the 12 hectare plot of land on which it is located for €150m in June 2023.

==Headquarters==

Axa headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Axa, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as Axa&#x27;s head office.

==Operations==
=== United Kingdom ===
Axa trades in the United Kingdom as Axa UK, with subsidiaries including Axa Insurance, Axa Wealth and Axa Health. AXA PPP International was the trading name for AXA PPP healthcare&#x27;s international health insurance division, which was later rebranded as AXA - Global Healthcare on 1 January 2017. The company bought the online insurer Swiftcover, notorious for its controversial Iggy Pop TV advertising campaign which was subsequently banned.

In September 2013, Axa Wealth was fined £1.8 million by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found &quot;serious defects&quot; in the way Axa advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.

In 2018, they became the &#x27;Official Global Insurance&#x27; partner of Premier League team Liverpool F.C. and in 2019, began sponsoring the training kits of the team. In 2020, the partnership was cemented further, when they purchased the naming rights to the club&#x27;s newly built training centre, which became officially known as &#x27;The AXA Training Centre.&#x27;

In 2016, Axa Wealth was sold to the Phoenix Group.

<doc id="1256150" wikidata="Q1854523" url="?curid=1256150" title="Ernie Irvan">
<text>Virgil Earnest Irvan (born January 13, 1959), occasionally referred to as Swervin&#x27; Irvan, is an American former professional stock car racing driver. A retired NASCAR competitor, he is perhaps best remembered for his comeback after a serious head injury suffered from a crash during practice at Michigan International Speedway in 1994 that left him with only a 10% chance of survival. Irvan has been inducted into numerous halls of fame and was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998. After a series of injuries in the late 1990s, he retired from racing in 1999.

== Early career ==
Irvan began his racing career driving karts in California in 1968 at the age of nine. He won the California Championship at the age of 15. In 1974, Irvan finished second in the country in his class at the national kart championship races. In 1975, Irvan moved up to stock cars at the age of 16 at Stockton 99 Speedway and was victorious in his first race on asphalt in a semi-main event. From then until 1981 Irvan raced every weekend at Madera and Stockton, California, winning numerous feature events. He missed his high school graduation ceremony to race at Riverside, California. During this time, he lost his best friend, Tim Williamson, in a racing accident at Riverside, several months before he was slated to test in the Winston Cup.

== Early Winston Cup ==
In 1982, Irvan left California with $700 in his pocket and everything he owned loaded into his pickup truck and a homemade trailer, and he headed east to North Carolina. Worried about running out of money, Irvan stopped in Las Vegas and managed to leave with an additional $200.

Irvan supported himself in Charlotte, North Carolina by welding grandstand seats at Charlotte Motor Speedway, unloading Ken Schrader&#x27;s moving van, building racecars, and other odd jobs. During that time, he won nine races driving in the late model series at Concord Speedway. Driving a Firebird, Irvan won two races his first year and seven races the next year.

Irvan met car-builder Marc Reno and they became partners in their racing ventures. Before long, Irvan made his Winston Cup debut, on September 13, 1987, at Richmond Fairgrounds Raceway driving the No. 56 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The car, built and prepared by Irvan and Reno, was sponsored by Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet. Irvan qualified 20th but was sidelined after 35 laps after the car&#x27;s engine overheated. He finished 29th and won $860. Irvan was noticed by long-time owner and driver D.K. Ulrich and made three additional starts in Ulrich&#x27;s No. 6 car, finishing 15th at Martinsville, 22nd at North Wilkesboro Speedway, and 19th at Riverside. In October, Irvan drove the No. 56, again sponsored by Dale Earnhardt, in his first Winston Cup start at Charlotte, starting 36th, leading lap 128, and finishing eighth.

In 1988, Irvan made a bid for NASCAR Rookie of the Year, driving Ulrich&#x27;s No. 2 Kroger Chevrolets and Pontiacs. Irvan competed in 25 of the 29 Winston Cup Series events, losing rookie-of-the-year honors to Ken Bouchard by three points (242–239) in the closest battle in Winston Cup history. Irvan&#x27;s best finish of the year was 11th at Martinsville in September. He finished 26th in the final points standings with winnings for the year totaling $96,370. In 1989 Irvan started all 29 races in his first full year in the Winston Cup Series behind the wheel of Ulrich&#x27;s U.S. Racing Pontiac. Irvan started 25th at Bristol in April and caught leader Mark Martin after 38 laps. Irvan went on to lead 56 laps before being sidelined in an accident on lap 167. Irvan&#x27;s sixth-place finish at Martinsville in September gave him his best of four top-10 finishes for the year. Irvan finished 22nd in the final standings for the year with winnings totaling $155,239.

== 1990s success ==
After sponsorship problems plagued Ulrich&#x27;s team, Irvan left to race for Junie Donlavey, who had procured a sponsorship program with True Cure. True Cure failed to fulfill its financial obligations, and after three races, Irvan was told he could seek other opportunities. He moved over to Morgan-McClure Motorsports&#x27; (MMM) No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Oldsmobile, filling the vacancy left by Phil Parsons. After starting 30th in his first race for the new team (Atlanta in March), Irvan charged to the front and grabbed a third-place finish, the first Top 5 of his career. The next race, at Darlington Raceway, he became involved in controversy after being involved in an accident that nearly killed Neil Bonnett. Irvan then won his first Winston Cup pole position, at Bristol, in the spring. He won his first Winston Cup race, in the Busch 500 at Bristol, on August 25. Ernie wrapped up the season with three poles, one victory, six Top 5&#x27;s, and 13 Top 10&#x27;s; he also won $535,280 and finished ninth in the final point standings.
In February 1991, Irvan drove the Morgan-McClure Chevrolet to victory in the Daytona 500, stock car racing&#x27;s most prestigious and then most lucrative race. Four years earlier, Irvan watched the 500 on a borrowed black and white TV while washing cars, one of several jobs he worked to support both his family and his struggling career. Irvan&#x27;s next victory came later in the season at Watkins Glen International Raceway. The race was marred by the death of popular veteran J. D. McDuffie. Irvan ended the year with two victories, three second-place and four fourth-place finishes among his eleven top-five and nineteen top-10 finishes in 29 starts. He finished the year fifth in Winston Cup driver standings and won $1,079,017. Irvan also picked up his first Busch Grand National Series win in the AC-Delco 200 at Rockingham. During this time, Irvan came under more controversy due to his aggressive driving style, earning him the nickname &quot;Swervin&#x27; Irvan&quot; by his fellow competitors. Irvan apologized to his fellow drivers in a televised speech at the driver&#x27;s meeting before the 1991 Diehard 500 after speaking with Darrell Waltrip and Richard Petty about improving his image.

Irvan&#x27;s 1992 season was highlighted by three more victories - Sonoma in June; Daytona in July; and Talladega in July. He had three pole positions, nine Top 5&#x27;s, and 11 Top 10&#x27;s, $996,885 in winnings, and finished 11th in the final season points standing. He scored a pair of Busch Grand National wins at Watkins Glen and Talladega. He suffered a broken collarbone in an accident during a Busch Series race in March at Atlanta and twelve finishes of 24th or worse including seven he did not finish. On November 21, 1992, he married Kim Baker.

===Moving to Robert Yates Racing===
Irvan continued his tenure with Morgan-McClure in 1993, adding poles at Dover in June and Daytona in July and a victory at Talladega in May. In total, while driving for Morgan-McClure, Irvan obtained nine poles, seven wins, and 51 Top 10 finishes in 105 starts. On July 12, 1993, Irvan experienced a significant personal loss when his friend, Davey Allison, died from injuries sustained in a helicopter crash outside of Talladega. Robert Yates, Allison&#x27;s team owner, asked Irvan to replace him as the driver of the #28 Texaco-Havoline Ford at Robert Yates Racing. Morgan-McClure was unwilling to let Irvan out of his contract with the team, and a lawsuit ensued.

After the night race at Bristol in August, Irvan was released from his duties driving the #4 and took over the #28 at the Southern 500 at Darlington the next week, where he started 10th and finished fifth. Irvan&#x27;s first victory with RYR came in his fourth start with the team when he won at Martinsville later that same month. Irvan dedicated his victory that day to Allison and then followed that victory two weeks later with one at Charlotte in which he led all but six laps. Irvan scored five front-row positions (including two poles) and two victories in his nine races that season with RYR. Irvan was ranked ninth in driver standings at the time of his departure from Morgan-McClure, but he rose to sixth in the final standings. At the 1994 Brickyard 400, Irvan was a factor and was leading with five laps to go when a tire puncture forced him to pit and lose a lap.

== Head injury ==
In August 1994, Irvan was a contender for the NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship throughout the first 20 races of the season. Entering the GM Goodwrench Dealer 400 at Michigan on August 21, Irvan was in a close battle with Dale Earnhardt as the class of the field. They were matched on wins with three each, while Irvan led in top-five finishes and winnings and trailed Earnhardt by 27 points after having led the standings for most of the season. Although only running 20 out of 31 races in the 1994 season, Irvan was ahead of all drivers in miles led.

His contention for the championship ended during a Saturday early-morning practice session at Michigan. Upon seeing how Irvan&#x27;s car was handling on the track, Irvan&#x27;s crew chief, Larry McReynolds, instructed Irvan to pit. Irvan decided to run one more lap and subsequently blew a tire.

The #28 careened into the concrete wall exiting turn two at 170 miles per hour (273 km/h). McReynolds, unaware that his driver had crashed, radioed to Irvan that the caution flag had just been displayed at the flag stand. One of the other members of the crew discovered that Irvan had crashed, and McReynolds and several others commandeered the pace car to take a ride over to the scene. Officials on the scene, however, refused to let them near the wreck due to the seriousness of the situation.

Track medical staff tended to Irvan, with a local trauma doctor offering assistance by performing an emergency tracheotomy to help him breathe. Irvan was then airlifted to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in nearby Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was diagnosed with a basilar skull fracture and lung injuries and given only a 10% chance of surviving the night. Irvan clung to life for the first two days. By early September, Irvan was listed in &quot;fair&quot; condition and was removed from ventilator support. A few weeks later, he was deemed well enough to be transferred to the Charlotte Institute of Rehabilitation in Charlotte. A few weeks following the transfer, Irvan appeared and addressed the fans at Charlotte Motor Speedway prior to the start of the Mello Yello 500.

Less than two months later, at the gala NASCAR Awards Banquet in New York, Irvan walked on stage at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel&#x27;s Grand Ballroom to receive the True Value Hard Charger Award. Despite missing the final 11 races at the end of the season, Irvan still ranked among the top five for the most laps led. In addition, Irvan tied Geoff Bodine for the most poles won during the season.

== Recovery and comeback ==

Throughout the first eight months of 1995, Irvan remained focused on returning to Winston Cup racing and did broadcast work for TNN while recovering. He went through rehabilitation and strength training to regain his physical strength. On September 16, NASCAR cleared Irvan for competition. His first attempt at qualifying for a race since his absence, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at Martinsville in late September, ended when the field was set by points standings after qualifying was rained out.

The following weekend&#x27;s events at North Wilkesboro Speedway would see Irvan qualify on the outside pole for the Truck Series event. Six laps after the green flag was dropped, Irvan passed pole sitter Mike Skinner for the lead. Irvan led another 23 laps before mechanical problems sidelined him.

That, however, was not the story of the weekend. For the first time since his accident at Michigan, Irvan entered a Winston Cup race. Driving in the #88 Texaco Havoline Ford as teammate to Dale Jarrett, who had taken over for Irvan in the #28, Irvan made the race; starting in seventh position, he advanced to third by lap 47 and took the lead on lap 125. He held the lead for 31 laps and finished on the lead lap in sixth position. Irvan started at Phoenix International Raceway a few weeks later but could not stay in the race due to engine failure, but he did lead the most laps despite having to start last in the field due to a crash in practice. He started the season finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway and finished seventh.
For the 1996 season, Irvan moved back into the #28 Ford as Jarrett, his substitute, became his full-time teammate in the #88.

Irvan&#x27;s comeback season started well when he qualified on the front row for the season opening Daytona 500 beside Dale Earnhardt. During Speedweeks, Irvan captured a victory in the 125-mile qualifying race for the Daytona 500. As the season progressed, Irvan won the pole position for the spring race at Talladega, then scored victories at New Hampshire and Richmond. On his way to a top-10 finish in the Winston Cup points standings, he collected 12 top-five and 16 top-10 finishes, led 15 of the 31 events, and earned a career-best $1,670,113.

Irvan returned for the 1997 season and notched his 15th career win. The victory came in June at Michigan Speedway, the track that nearly claimed his life three years earlier. Irvan ran up five top-five finishes, 13 top-10s and two pole positions and earned $1,614,281. This would be also be Ernie Irvan&#x27;s final season with Robert Yates. Irvan would be involved in an altercation in Charlotte during Easter weekend where he refused to dance with a female patron and escalated into a fight in the parking lot. In May, Irvan arrived late to a reception dinner thanking Texaco for 10 years of support. At the end of the year, Irvan was let go by Robert Yates Racing and replaced by rookie driver Kenny Irwin, Jr.

== Last years in NASCAR and retirement ==
In 1998, Irvan joined MB2 Motorsports to drive the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac. During the year he scored 11 top-10 finishes with three pole positions despite missing the final three races while recovering from injuries suffered at Talladega in October. Irvan finished the season 19th in the Winston Cup points standings, earning $1,476,141. His highlight of 1998 was the birth of his son, Jared, on February 9. Irvan continued driving the No. 36 for MB2 in 1999, but with a different sponsor. M&amp;M Mars (parent corporation of Skittles) decided to emblazon the popular M&amp;Ms characters on the car.

On August 20, exactly five years after his near fatal accident there, Irvan crashed at Michigan while driving his own No. 84 Irvan-Simo Federated Auto Parts Pontiac in a practice session for the Busch Series race. Irvan was again airlifted from the track and was diagnosed with a mild head injury and a bruised lung as a result of the accident.

Two weeks later, on September 3, 1999, surrounded by his wife and two children, Irvan announced his retirement from driving at a tearful press conference in Darlington, South Carolina. While he would fully recover before the end of the 1999 season, the reasoning for his retirement was to prevent future incidents while he had a family to support.

Irvan finished his Winston Cup career as a driver with 15 victories, 22 poles, 68 top-fives, 124 top-10s and over 11 million dollars in career earnings.

==After retirement from NASCAR==
Just before his final years in NASCAR, Irvan briefly co-owned a NASCAR Truck Series team in partnership with Mark Simo and No Fear. The team&#x27;s first driver was Joe Ruttman, who finished second in points in 1995. The team&#x27;s next and most famous driver was sports-car racer Boris Said, who drove the #44 Irvan-Simo Racing truck sponsored by Federated Auto Parts. Said&#x27;s only win was at Sonoma in 1998. The team also fielded a part-time Cup effort with Said in 1999, where Said qualified 2nd at Watkins Glen, led 9 laps, but retired with a blown engine.

Afterwards, Irvan announced he was planning to start a Cup team with Mark Simo with sponsorship from Federated Auto Parts, but it never materialized.

After a fire in his house destroyed all of his trophies in March 2000, NASCAR presented Irvan with replicas of the lost trophies.

As of 2007, he is the crew chief on his son Jared&#x27;s quarter midget. In 2012, Jared won the Quarter Midget Racing Championship and is leading the USAC Ignite Midget Eastern Region championship, and a late model car has been ordered for Jared&#x27;s planned move into late models. Jared also plans to run the 2015 NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East season.

Irvan attended five NASCAR races in 2006, promoting a foundation that he formed called Race2safety as an advocate for head-injury awareness. The foundation promotes awareness and prevention of head injuries, especially among children.

Irvan attended the 50th annual Daytona 500 and was one of the 24 grand marshals giving the command to start the engines.

The Irvan family used to live in Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina, near Charleston, where they owned El Cardenal Farm and organized the Equestrian Club of Charleston. According to Irvan on Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#x27;s Dirty Mo Media podcast in September 2020, he and his wife currently live in Ocala, Florida.

Irvan and his family were featured on &quot;NASCAR Now&quot; on its &quot;Wayback Wednesday&quot; segment. It featured him and his wife on their ranch in South Carolina.

Irvan was (and still is) recognized on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; by Ronnie &quot;the Limo Driver&quot; Mund, who mentioned Irvan as his favorite NASCAR driver; the drop of Mund saying Irvan&#x27;s name is still played on the show today and has been featured in multiple prank calls by Sal &quot;the Stock Broker&quot; Governale and Richard &quot;Supertwink&quot; Christy.

In June 2016, Irvan was inducted into the Sonoma Raceway Wall of Fame. He currently helps out his son Jared in his racing career and spends time with his family on their farm.

<text>Deanna Wallace (née Bowers), also known as Dee Wallace Stone (born December 14, 1948), is an American actress. She is perhaps best known for her role as Mary Taylor in the 1982 blockbuster science-fiction film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

Wallace earned further recognition as a scream queen for starring in several horror films, including &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975), &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977), &quot;The Howling&quot; (1981), &quot;Cujo&quot; (1983), &quot;Critters&quot; (1986), &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996), &quot; Halloween&quot; (2007), &quot;The House of the Devil&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Lords of Salem&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Wallace was born in Kansas City, Kansas, the daughter of Maxine (née Nichols), a secretary, and Robert Stanley Bowers. Wallace&#x27;s father developed severe alcoholism before dying by suicide when Wallace was in high school. Her mother was a stage actress and producer who appeared in community-theater productions in Kansas City, which inspired Wallace&#x27;s interest in acting.

After graduating from Wyandotte High School, Wallace attended the University of Kansas and obtained an education degree. She briefly taught high-school drama at Washington High School in her native Kansas City in the early 1970s.

==Career==

Wallace began her career on television appearing in episodes of &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, and &quot;Police Woman&quot;, before appearing in the box-office horror hit film &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (1977). In 1981, she played a leading role in the horror film &quot;The Howling&quot; opposite her husband Christopher Stone. They later starred together in &quot;Cujo&quot; (1983) based on Stephen King&#x27;s 1981 novel of the same name.

In 1982, Wallace went on to star in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). The film became the highest-grossing film of all time—a record held for 11 years until &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, another Spielberg-directed film, surpassed it in 1993. Wallace received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance at the 10th Saturn Awards. Wallace also starred in a number of comedy films, including &quot;10&quot; (1979), &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1982), and &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; (1985). In 1986, she starred in the horror comedy film &quot;Critters&quot; (a role she later reprised in a sequel, &quot;Critters Attack!&quot;, in 2019). She has also appeared in many other horror films, most notably Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996).

On television, Wallace played a leading role in the CBS sitcom &quot;Together We Stand&quot; (1986–1987) and the family drama &quot;The New Lassie&quot; (1989–1992). She guest-starred in episodes of a number of shows, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and &quot;The Office&quot;. In 2015, Wallace was cast on the ABC soap opera series &quot;General Hospital&quot;, as Patricia Spencer, the unseen, long-lost older sister of Luke and Bobbie Spencer; Wallace appeared in the show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, which aired on January 27, 2016. In 2016, she was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Guest Performer in a Drama Series at the 43rd Daytime Emmy Awards for her performance in &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was briefly married first to Barry Wallace and still uses his last name in her career. Their marriage ended in divorce. She married Christopher Stone in 1980, who died suddenly in 1995. They have one daughter, Gabrielle Stone.

Wallace is a public speaker and self-help author, having written three books, and has her own call-in radio show, in which she talks exclusively about the creation of &quot;self&quot;. She often speaks about how one can get through tough times with determination and love. She has also written a book called &quot;Bright Light&quot; about her life lessons from an acting career. In 2018, she gave her first TED talk at TEDx Cape May, entitled &quot;The Common Ground of Self&quot;.

<doc id="1256157" wikidata="Q2889028" url="?curid=1256157" title="Battle of Kurikara Pass">
<text>The , also known as the battle of Tonamiyama (砺波山), was a crucial engagement in Japan&#x27;s Genpei War; in this battle the tide of the war turned in the favour of the Minamoto clan.

&quot;Yoshinaka won by a clever strategy; under cover of nightfall his troops enveloped the main body of the Taira, demoralized them by a series of tactical surprises, and turned their confusion into a disastrous, headlong rout.&quot;

==Background==
Minamoto no Yoshinaka, commander of a contingent of warriors from Shinano Province, invaded Taira lands in Shinano, Echigo, Etchū, Kaga and Echizen. The war was put on hold in 1181 on account of two years of famine. As conditions improved in 1183, the Taira sought retribution against Yoshinaka. Taira no Koremori, son of Taira no Shigemori and grandson of the late Taira no Kiyomori, took charge of this operation, backed by Taira Michimori, Tadanori, Taira no Tomonori, Taira no Tsunemasa and Taira no Kiyofusa. Their forces severely reduced by battle and famine, the Taira sought to recruit warriors from the surrounding lands and did so at the risk of further famine, since many of these warriors were farmers leaving their land. The Taira army departed from Kyoto on 10 May 1183.

Minamoto no Yoritomo, Yoshinaka&#x27;s cousin, moved to fight him for dominance of the clan in March 1183, but was convinced to stand down and withdraw by Yoshinaka, who argued that they should be united against the Taira. To ensure his intentions, Yoshinaka also sent his son to Kamakura as a hostage. Shortly afterwards, Yoshinaka received news of Koremori&#x27;s army, and moved to engage him, along with his uncle Minamoto no Yukiie, Tomoe Gozen, and his &quot;shitennō&quot;, Imai Kanehira, Higuchi Kanemitsu, Tate Chikatada and Nenoi Yukichika.

==Battle==

Approaching the mountain passes which connect western Honshū to the east, Koremori split his forces in two, one part taking the Kurikara Pass (between Tsubata, Ishikawa and Oyabe, Toyama today) up to Tonamiyama, the other entering Etchū Province through Noto Province to the north. Minamoto no Yoshinaka, seeing the Taira forces coming up the pass, displayed thirty white banners on Kurosaka Hill a few kilometers away to trick his enemies into believing that his force was larger than it really was. This was a delaying tactic, aimed at keeping the Taira atop the pass until night fell, so that the second part of his strategy could fall in place.

He divided his own forces into three, sending one group to attack the Taira from the rear; a second beneath the Pass, as an ambush party; and the third he accompanied and held centrally. In order to conceal these movements, Yoshinaka sought to distract his enemy with a highly formal battle, beginning with archery exchanges using whistling-bulb arrows. This was followed by individual duels amongst a hundred samurai, to which the Taira gladly indulged, in the hopes of earning their individual places in the chronicles and epic poetry which were sure to follow such a war.

Meanwhile, Yoshinaka&#x27;s armies moved into position, and as the sun set, the Taira turned to find behind them a Minamoto detachment, holding far more flags than a single detachment should merit, giving the illusion of greater numbers. Yoshinaka&#x27;s central force, having gathered a herd of oxen, now released them down the pass directly into the Taira army, with lit torches tied to their horns, a strategy learned from the ancient Qi general Tian Dan. Many of the Taira warriors were simply knocked off the path. Yoshinaka&#x27;s soldiers then charged down the north slope forcing the Taira down into the Kairaka Valley and Yoshinaka&#x27;s ambush.

==Aftermath==
The surviving Taira, confused, demoralized, and having suffered heavy losses, fled. This was a major victory for the Minamoto, leading to the Taira abandoning Kyoto.

<doc id="1256161" wikidata="Q286110" url="?curid=1256161" title="Galliano (band)">
<text>Galliano are a London-based acid jazz group that were originally active between 1988 and 1997. The group was the first signing to Eddie Piller and Gilles Peterson&#x27;s Acid Jazz record label. The original members were Rob Gallagher (vocals – credited as Roberto Galliano), Constantine Weir (vocals), Michael Snaith (The Vibe Controller) and Crispin Robinson (percussion). 

Other important members included Valerie Etienne, who participated in the recording of all their albums, along with other musicians such as Mick Talbot on keyboards, Crispin Taylor on drums, Ernie McKone on bass guitar, Mark Vandergucht guitar, and Steve Ameedee, otherwise known as Uncle Big Man (dancer). Ski Oakenfull replaced Mick Talbot on keyboards in 1994. The band split in November 1997 after musical differences over direction of travel. The band announced a return in 2023, including several live gigs, including several live gigs and a new album that was released in 2024.

== Career ==
The group&#x27;s first single, a reworking of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; called &quot;Frederick Lies Still&quot;, was released in June 1988. It was also the first release on the Acid Jazz label. Their second release was on &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot; by &quot;The Quiet Boys&quot; in 1989. &quot;The Quiet Boys&quot; was an alias used by acid jazz pioneer Chris Bangs who then went on to produce Galliano.

Galliano&#x27;s first album release was &quot;In Pursuit of the 13th Note&quot; in 1991, which was produced by Bangs. Their second album &quot;A Joyful Noise Unto the Creator&quot; was released in 1992.

Galliano achieved the peak of their success in 1994 with &quot;The Plot Thickens&quot; which peaked at number eight in the UK Albums Chart. Two UK top 40 singles were released from the album &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; (a cover of a David Crosby song from the self titled first album by Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash) and &quot;Twyford Down&quot;. The latter was a comment on the road building protests taking place at the time and the protest at Twyford Down in particular, and they were joined onstage by anti-roads protestors to make appeals to the audience. The album was well received making the NME&#x27;s list of top 50 albums of the year. Following its release Galliano performed on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 1994 and returned to play the NME Stage in 1995.

Galliano&#x27;s fourth and final studio album &quot;:4&quot; was released in 1996. This included the track &quot;Slack Hands&quot;, which was used in the title sequence of Kevin Reynolds&#x27; 1997 film, &quot;One Eight Seven&quot;, starring Samuel L. Jackson.

Galliano broke up in 1997. Gallagher together with Etienne formed Two Banks of Four; Gallagher also performs solo using the names Earl Zinger, William Anderson and together with Alex Patchwork as The Diabolical Liberties. 

In early 2023, Galliano announced a return, including a new album and a few live gigs that year. The band played twice at Gilles Peterson&#x27;s We Out Here Festival in August 2023, playing covers of &quot;Harvest for the World&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;Uptown Top Ranking&quot; alongside their original material.

In May 2024, they released their first single in 28 years, &quot;Circles Going Round The Sun&quot;; in June 2024, they released &quot;Pleasure, Joy &amp; Happiness&quot;, a cover of a song by Eddie Chacon. Their fifth album, &quot;Halfway Somewhere&quot;, their first in 28 years, was released on 30 August 2024. The album was co-produced by Rob Gallagher (lead vocals) and Ski Oakenfull (keyboards), and featured many of the original musicians incuding Valerie Etienne (lead vocals), Ernie McKone (bass guitar), Crispin Taylor (drums), Crispin Robinson (percussion), and Booie Gallagher (percussion).

<doc id="1256165" wikidata="Q1332886" url="?curid=1256165" title="Calorie restriction">
<text>Calorie restriction (also known as caloric restriction or energy restriction) is a dietary regimen that reduces the energy intake from foods and beverages without incurring malnutrition. The possible effect of calorie restriction on body weight management, longevity, and aging-associated diseases has been an active area of research.

==Dietary guidelines==

Caloric intake control, and reduction for overweight individuals, is recommended by US dietary guidelines and science-based societies.

Calorie restriction is recommended for people with diabetes and prediabetes, in combination with physical exercise and a weight loss goal of 5-15% for diabetes and 7-10% for prediabetes to prevent progression to diabetes. Mild calorie restriction may be beneficial for pregnant women to reduce weight gain (without weight loss) and reduce perinatal risks for both the mother and child. For overweight or obese individuals, calorie restriction may improve health through weight loss, although a gradual weight regain of per year may occur.

===Risks of malnutrition===
The term &quot;calorie restriction&quot; as used in the study of aging refers to dietary regimens that reduce calorie intake without incurring malnutrition. If a restricted diet is not designed to include essential nutrients, malnutrition may result in serious deleterious effects, as shown in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. This study was conducted during World War II on a group of lean men, who restricted their calorie intake by 45% for six months and composed roughly 77% of their diet with carbohydrates. As expected, this malnutrition resulted in metabolic adaptations, such as decreased body fat, improved lipid profile, and decreased resting heart rate. The experiment also caused negative effects, such as anemia, edema, muscle wasting, weakness, dizziness, irritability, lethargy, and depression.

Typical low-calorie diets may not supply sufficient nutrient intake that is typically included in a calorie restriction diet.

===Possible side effects===
People losing weight during calorie restriction risk developing side effects, such as cold sensitivity, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or hormonal changes.

==Research==

===Humans===
Decreasing caloric intake by 20-30%, while fulfilling nutrient requirements, has been found to remedy diseases of aging, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and diabetes in humans, and result in an average loss of in body weight, but because of the long lifespan of humans, evidence that calorie restriction could prevent age-related disease in humans remains under preliminary research. While calorie restriction leads to weight and fat loss, the precise amount of calorie intake and associated fat mass for optimal health in humans is not known. Moderate amounts of calorie restriction may have harmful effects on certain population groups, such as lean people with low body fat.

===Life extension===
As of 2021, intermittent fasting and calorie restriction remain under preliminary research to assess the possible effects on disease burden and increased lifespan during aging, although the relative risks associated with long-term fasting or calorie restriction remain undetermined.

Intermittent fasting refers to periods with intervals during which no food but only clear fluids are ingested – such as a period of daily time-restricted eating with a window of 8 to 12 hours for any caloric intake – and could be combined with overall calorie restriction and variants of the Mediterranean diet which may contribute to long-term cardiovascular health and longevity.

===Minnesota Starvation Experiment===
The Minnesota Starvation Experiment examined the physical and psychological effects of extreme calorie restriction on 32 young and lean 24-year-old men during a 40% reduction in energy intake for 6 months. The study was designed to mimic dietary conditions during World War II. Participants could only eat 1800 kcal per day, but were required to walk 5 km per day and expend 3000 calories. The men lost about 25% of their body weight of which 67% was fat mass and 17% fat-free mass. The quality of the diet was insufficient to accurately represent the diet during war due to the inadequate consumption of protein, and a lack of fruits and vegetables. Despite the extreme calorie restriction, the experiment was not representative of true calorie-restrictive diets, which adhere to intake guidelines for macronutrients and micronutrients. Chronic weakness, decreased aerobic capacity, and painful lower limb edema was caused by the malnourished calorie restrictive diet. Emotional distress, confusion, apathy, depression, hysteria, hypochondriasis, suicidal thoughts, and loss of sex drive were among the abnormal psychological behaviors that occurred within six weeks.

===Intensive care===
, current clinical guidelines recommend that hospitals ensure that the patients get fed with 80–100% of energy expenditure, the normocaloric feeding. A systematic review investigated whether people in intensive care units have different outcomes with normocaloric feeding or hypocaloric feeding, and found no difference. However, a comment criticized the inadequate control of protein intake, and raised concerns that hypocaloric feeding safety should be further assessed with underweight critically ill people.

===Non-human primates===
A calorie restriction study started in 1987 by the National Institute on Aging showed that calorie restriction did not extend years of life or reduce age-related deaths in non-obese rhesus macaques. It did improve certain measures of health, however. These results were publicized as being different from the Wisconsin rhesus macaque calorie restriction study, which also started in 1987 and showed an increase in the lifespan of rhesus macaques following calorie restriction.

In a 2017 report on rhesus monkeys, caloric restriction in the presence of adequate nutrition was effective in delaying the effects of aging. Older age of onset, female sex, lower body weight and fat mass, reduced food intake, diet quality, and lower fasting blood glucose levels were factors associated with fewer disorders of aging and with improved survival rates. Specifically, reduced food intake was beneficial in adult and older primates, but not in younger monkeys. The study indicated that caloric restriction provided health benefits with fewer age-related disorders in elderly monkeys and, because rhesus monkeys are genetically similar to humans, the benefits and mechanisms of caloric restriction may apply to human health during aging.

===Activity levels===
Calorie restriction preserves muscle tissue in nonhuman primates and rodents. Muscle tissue grows when stimulated, so it has been suggested that the calorie-restricted test animals exercised more than their companions on higher calories, perhaps because animals enter a foraging state during calorie restriction. However, studies show that overall activity levels are no higher in calorie restriction than ad libitum animals in youth.

=== Sirtuin-mediated mechanism ===

Preliminary research indicates that sirtuins are activated by fasting and serve as &quot;energy sensors&quot; during metabolism. Sirtuins, specifically Sir2 (found in yeast) have been implicated in the aging of yeast, and are a class of highly conserved, NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase enzymes. Sir2 homologs have been identified in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to humans.

<text>In intelligence organizations, agent handling is the management of so-called agents (called secret agents or spies in common parlance), principal agents, and agent networks (called &quot;assets&quot;) by intelligence officers typically known as case officers.

==Human intelligence==
A primary purpose of intelligence organizations is to penetrate a target with a human agent, or a network of human agents. Such agents can either infiltrate the target, or be recruited &quot;in place&quot;. Case officers are professionally trained employees of intelligence organizations that manage human agents and human agent networks. Intelligence that derives from such human sources is known by the abbreviation HUMINT.

Sometimes, agent handling is done indirectly, through &quot;principal agents&quot; that serve as proxies for case officers. It is not uncommon, for example, for a case officer to manage a number of principal agents, who in turn handle agent networks, which are preferably organized in a cellular fashion. In such a case, the principal agent can serve as a &quot;cut-out&quot; for the case officer, buffering him or her from direct contact with the agent network.

Using a principal agent as a cut-out, and ensuring that the human agent network is organized in a cellular fashion, can provide some protection for other agents in the network, as well as for the principal agent, and for the case officer if an agent in the network is compromised. Assuming that standard principles of intelligence tradecraft have been strictly observed by the principal agent and the agents in the network, compromised agents will not be able to identify the case officer, nor the other members of the network. Ideally, agents may work side by side in the same office, and conduct their clandestine collection activities with such discipline, that they will not realize that they are both engaged in espionage, much less members of the same network.

Since an agent can sometimes identify his or her principal agent, however, or reveal information under interrogation that can lead to the identification of a principal agent, the protection provided by cellular network organization can be time-sensitive.

If principles of intelligence tradecraft have not been strictly observed, it is also possible that compromised agents can reveal information that exposes other members of the network. In the real world of espionage, human lapses are very much the norm, and violations of the principles of tradecraft are common. It is for this reason that agents are ideally trained to resist interrogation for a defined period of time.

If an agent is able to resist interrogation for a defined period of time, the odds improve that other members of the network can be alerted to the compromise.

==Case officer==
A case officer is an intelligence officer who is a trained specialist in the management of agents and agent networks. Case officers manage human agents and human intelligence networks. Case officers spot potential agents, recruit prospective agents and train agents in tradecraft. Case officers emphasize the elements of tradecraft that enable the agent to acquire needed information, and enable the case officer to communicate with and supervise the agent. Most importantly, case officers train agents in methods of avoiding detection by host nation counter-intelligence organizations.

==Agents, spotting, and recruitment==
By definition, an &quot;agent&quot; acts on behalf of another, whether another individual, an organization, or a foreign government. Agents can be considered either witting or unwitting, and in some cases, willing or unwilling. Agents typically work under the direction of a principal agent or a case officer. When agents work alone, and are not members of an agent network, they are termed &quot;singletons&quot;.

The identification of potential agents is termed &quot;agent spotting&quot; (also termed &quot;talent spotting&quot;). Identifying potential agents, and investigating the details of their personal and professional lives, involves the granular verification of their bona fides. Such activities can include uncovering personal details that leave potential agents vulnerable to coercion, blackmail, or other inducements, such as sexual approaches.

Approaches to potential agents can be multitudinous and considerable time can pass before the potential agent is maneuvered into a position where a recruitment &quot;pitch&quot; can be hazarded.

==Training==
Agent training often includes techniques of tradecraft such as clandestine communication, including cryptography, the use of one-time pads, the construction of concealment devices, and the employment of dead drops. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, surveillance and countersurveillance, photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop &quot;cover for status&quot;, and &quot;cover for action&quot;, meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. More advanced agent training can include resistance to interrogation.

<text>A. Lange &amp; Söhne is a trademark of Lange Uhren GmbH, a German manufacturer of luxury and prestige watches. The company was originally founded by Ferdinand Adolph Lange in Glashütte, Kingdom of Saxony in 1845. The original A. Lange &amp; Söhne was nationalized and ceased to exist in 1948, following the occupation by the Soviet Union after World War II. The current A. Lange &amp; Söhne trademark was re-registered when &quot;Lange Uhren GmbH&quot; was founded in 1990 by Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand Adolph Lange.

A. Lange &amp; Söhne is a highly regarded watch manufacturer. Notable early patrons and timepieces owners of Lange included German Emperor Wilhelm II, Abdul Hamid II of Ottoman Empire, and Alexander II of Russia. Since 2000, Lange Uhren GmbH has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group. Lange watches boast distinctive Glashütte style in appearance and design, which is different from and more &quot;Teutonic&quot; than Swiss styles. The company&#x27;s current model families are Lange 1, Zeitwerk, Saxonia, 1815, Richard Lange and Odysseus.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Ferdinand Adolph Lange, son of Johann Samuel Lange, was born in Dresden on 25 February 1815. When his parents were separated, he was adopted by a foster family, who luckily offered him a chance of proper education. In 1829, he entered the Technische Bildungsanstalt (technical education institute) of Dresden. The training in the school was accompanied by three days of theoretical studies and the other three days were devoted to manual craftwork with a student&#x27;s master. Ferdinand Adolph Lange&#x27;s master was Johann Christian Friedrich Gutkaes (the maker of the famous Five-Minute Clock at Dresden&#x27;s Semperoper), who at the time was second mechanic at the Mathematics and Physics Salon providing an astronomical clock with a mercury compensation pendulum for his service observatory.

After finishing his apprenticeship with honours in 1835, Ferdinand A. Lange worked for Gutkaes for more than two years. In 1837 Lange embarked on his journeyman years, which took him to France, England and Switzerland. In Paris, he spent four years working as workshop manager of Austrian watchmaker Joseph Thaddäus Winnerl (inventor of the split-seconds chronograph). The lectures given by the physician and director of the Paris Observatory Dominique François Arago extended his knowledge of astronomy. After France, he went to Switzerland and Great Britain to improve his knowledge and skills even further with well-known watchmakers. However, Lange&#x27;s intention was to set up a watchmaking industry in Saxony. He returned to Dresden in 1841 and became partners with his master&#x27;s business.

Lange wasted no time in building complicated watches to put into practice what he learnt through his journey years, which all noted in his notebook. His main ambition was the industrialization of the area and become independent as he made verbal proposals in a letter he sent to the government minister Von Lindenau and councillor Weissenbach. His ambition was to found a watch manufactory in Saxony. He asked a commission from the government to grant him a business licence in the less economically fortunate region, “Erzgebirge” (Ore Mountains) in Glashütte. Mentions in the letter as follows:

“&quot;…Should the high council be able and willing to grand the wherewithal for the establishment of an institution and the welfare of 10-15 young people, and to entrust me with its leadership, I am certain that in a near future, livelihood and prosperity will spread among a large number of these unfortunate people…&quot;”
On 7 December 1845, he founded A. Lange &amp; Cie, which later became A. Lange &amp; Söhne in Glashütte. Lange founded not only a watchmaking factory that would bear his name; he also established his vision for an entire industry. Starting with a team of 15 apprentices, to whom he taught the basics of watchmaking. Later on, when they had thoroughly mastered the crafts, he encouraged them to leave his company to start their own small supplier firms. Thus, he established a watchmaking cluster, which provided the region with a new means to make a living.

As Ferdinand Adolph Lange travelled through France he saw French watchmakers still used duodecimal ligne as length unit instead of the new metric system. Accordingly, he recorded detailed calculations for each individual gear-wheel size. Returning from his travels, he started to use the metric system in watchmaking instead of the traditional norm, ligne. Soon after, he built his first micrometer in Dresden from the plans in his journey book. It could measure millimeters to the thousandth. Along with a measurement system, he invented various tools like hand-powered face-lathe to slide-rules and dixieme gauges.

=== Rise to fame ===
In 1868, Ferdinand A. Lange&#x27;s elder son Richard entered the company, and the company name changed to &quot;A. Lange &amp; Söhne&quot; (A. Lange &amp; Sons). He had seven children and also took on political responsibility in his home town: He was the mayor of Glashütte for a period of 18 years. After retiring from this position, he was awarded with the honorary citizenship. Additionally, the citizens of Glashütte established the Lange Foundation, which provided pensions for local watchmakers. He died in 1875.

At the time when Emil and Richard Lange joined the company, the name A. Lange &amp; Söhne was already growing and the company needed new premises. In 1873, the company moved to the Stammhaus, which is being used as the company&#x27;s headquarters today. The new building gave Lange senior the opportunity to realize his idea, a clock with a pendulum of almost 10 meters, the longest in the world. Emil and Richard Lange were complementing each other. While Emil was interested in business, Richard Lange followed his father&#x27;s path. He advanced his father&#x27;s inventions and patents such as quarter repeater and chronograph. Some of his notable patents include an up/down power reserve indicator (patent No.9349), improved chronometer restraints, pocket watch with minutes counter, and addition of beryllium to improve the rate characteristic of balance spring

Emil Lange was awarded the cross of the Knight of the French Legion of Honor for his services as a juror at the Paris world fair and the presentation of the “Jahrhunderttourbillon” (tourbillon of the century). The model was auctioned in 1990 and sold for 1,500,000 Marks. Furthermore, Emil Lange was given the honorary title of “Kommerzienrat” (commercial councilor) by King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony for his success as businessman. In 1898, German Emperor Wilhelm II commissioned A. Lange &amp; Söhne to make a pocket watch that would be presented to Sultan Abdul Hamid II during an official visit of the Ottoman Empire. The watch is in the collection of the Topkapı Palace.

The turn of the 20th century came with a change in fashion. Flat watches for men were increasing in demand. A. Lange &amp; Söhne came up with a new design and registered it in 1898 as “Glashütte caliber” pocket watch. However, in the beginning of the century, in 1904 “Glashütte Präzisons-Uhrenfabrik Akt. Ges.” was founded and then in 1906 “Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft” came up. Both companies offered machine-made watches or movements imported from Switzerland and cased up in Glashütte. By contrast, A. Lange &amp; Söhne was still offering hand-made watches and operating with high costs.

=== World Wars I &amp; II ===

Due to World War I, demand for precious gold watches fell sharply. Many companies had to let go most of their workforce. At the same time, Germany closed its borders to Swiss watches and movements forcing firms dependent on Switzerland out of production. Shortly after the war, German watchmakers founded “Deutsche Präzisions-Uhrenfabrik Glashütte in Sachsen GmbH” (German precision watch factory Glashütte in Saxony), known by its acronym DPUG. The idea was to go to mass production using latest technological machinery. Emil Lange decided not to follow this direction. In 1919, he retired and left the company to his three sons: Otto, Rudolf and Gerhard Lange.

To counter inexpensive production of DPUG, Otto Lange launched a new brand “OLIW” (Original Lange Internationales Werk) and designed a 43mm diameter movement. It was protected in Germany under registered design No. 748 972. It took years to complete the OLIW and serial production did not start until the late 1920s. Between 1921 and 1923, hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic triggered a wave of corporate bankruptcies. Prices ran out of control, for example a loaf of bread, which cost 250 marks in January 1923, had risen to 200,000 million marks in November 1923. At A. Lange &amp; Söhne, sales of OLIW remained behind expectations. In the Glashütte watch industry, most of the workforce was laid off during 1920 and 1930s. Walter Lange describes the situation as follows:

“&quot;I was born in the Weimar era; then came the crash in 1929 and the great unemployment. I can still see it today; it was a childhood trauma for me, when I looked out the living room window and saw all the unemployed men lined up, waiting across the street. I will never forget that view.&quot;”

Germany&#x27;s military buildup of the 1930s brought the demand for precision watches back to Glashütte. From the second half of the thirties to the end of World War II, A. Lange &amp; Söhne was one of five watch manufacturers (the others being Stowa, Laco, Wempe and IWC) that built B-Uhren for Germany&#x27;s air force (Luftwaffe). B-Uhren is an abbreviation of Beobachtungsuhren, literally: observation watches. The total military production amounted to about 13,500 precision watches, equipped with caliber 48 (small seconds) and caliber 48.1 (sweep seconds) with a movement diameter of 48mm.

A. Lange &amp; Söhne, as well as other Glashütte watchmakers, used slave labour to build chronometers, timers, and fuses. During this time Glashütte contained more prisoners than residents, most were women from other European countries.

On 8 May 1945, the last day of the war, the Lange headquarter and main production building was almost completely destroyed in a Soviet air raid. The Glashütte watch companies were nationalized in 1948. At the time, Lange was working on a new movement: Caliber 28, a wristwatch format of the caliber 48. It went into production in 1949 as the last movement developed by A. Lange &amp; Söhne. Watches from this period were signed “Lange VEB” (Volkseigener Betrieb - publicly owned enterprise). When the seized watch companies were merged in 1951 to form VEB Glashütter Uhrenbetriebe, the Lange name disappeared from the dials.

=== Recent development ===
On 7 December 1990, following German reunification, Walter Lange and Günter Blümlein, a watch industry executive, restored the company as &quot;Lange Uhren GmbH,&quot; with the assistance of several Swiss watch manufacturers, including IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre. It was re-established on the exact date 145 years after Walter&#x27;s great-grandfather Ferdinand Adolph Lange founded the original company. The new company re-registered &quot;A. Lange &amp; Söhne&quot; as its trademark, and was again based in Glashütte. It presented its first range of wristwatches in 1994.

Since 2000, A. Lange &amp; Söhne has been a member of the Richemont group, and only manufactured around five thousand watches every year. In 2017, Walter Lange died at age 92.

== Pronunciation and spelling ==
A. Lange &amp; Söhne is pronounced , approximately &quot;ah LAHNG-eh unt ZUR-neh&quot; (by an English speaker who doesn&#x27;t pronounce their R&#x27;s). Where the Umlaut &quot;ö&quot; is not available, it is rendered as a digraph by German convention (&quot;Soehne&quot;), but often as &quot;Sohne&quot; internationally (even though that would imply a different pronunciation in German).

== Motto and slogan ==
One of A. Lange &amp; Söhne&#x27;s company slogans is &quot;State-of-the-art Tradition&quot;. In addition, a notable personal motto of Walter Lange is &quot;Never Stand Still&quot;.

==Watch manufacturing==
All A. Lange &amp; Söhne watches contain mechanical rather than quartz movements, and, with the exception of a very few special edition watches and the Odysseus model, Lange watch cases are made of yellow gold, rose gold, white gold, or platinum. Lange&#x27;s movements are developed, produced, and assembled by Lange itself. In addition to time-only watches, both manually wound and automatic, Lange is known for its complicated watches, including chronographs and split-seconds chronographs, and perpetual calendars.

=== Design and finishing ===
The design philosophy of A. Lange &amp; Söhne was established in 1990 when the company was re-established, and it draws from heritage. Lange&#x27;s watches are often described as more &quot;austere&quot; or &quot;Teutonic&quot; in appearance than watches produced by comparable Swiss firms. Case and dial design are straightforward, confident, solid and comforting. Recurrent design elements are the outsize date, inspired by the stage clock of Dresden&#x27;s Semperoper, solid gold or platinum cases, the shape of the soldered lugs, the galvanized solid-silver dials and the customized typography based on the “Engravers” font from 1899.

The company employs hand-finishing for all their pieces. A. Lange &amp; Söhne applies same level of top hand-finishing on all their pieces from the basic Saxonia to Grand Complication. The hand-engraved balance cock is the brand&#x27;s signature technique. A. Lange &amp; Söhne uses a multitude of different surface decorations. The most frequent finishing techniques are chamfering, circular graining, contour grinding, engraving, mirror polish, linear finish, perlage, Glashütte ribbing, sunray finish and black polish.

=== Movements ===
Lange&#x27;s movement design and decoration is distinctively Glashütte in appearance, eschewing typically Swiss features, such as multiple bridges and cocks, or perlage, &quot;Glashütte stripes&quot;, hand-engraved balance cocks and screwed gold chatons. The movements are made from a metal known as German silver, as opposed to the plated brass typically used for Swiss movements. It requires extra care and attention of the watchmaker. One wrong move carries the risk of tainting and tarnishing the material.

Each watch movement is designed and made entirely in-house. Since 1994, the brand has developed 63 different movements. Many of the movements feature patented constructions and advancements. The brand is especially known for its chronograph mechanisms. According to Lange&#x27;s director of product development, Anthony de Haas, it takes four to five years to develop a watch with a new caliber.

The movement numbers are named regarding their development years. For example, L043.1 (Zeitwerk) indicates that work on this particular Lange (L) movement started in 2004 (04), that it is the third project of that year (3) and that it is the first version of this caliber (.1). Prototypes undergo rigorous load tests before going into series production. The testing routine includes a shaking test, a hammer test, which simulates a free fall from a height of one meter onto a hardwood floor, a pusher test, during which each pusher is pressed 50,000 times and a climatic chamber, where the watches are exposed to temperatures from minus 20 degrees to 80 degrees.

=== Notable inventions and patents ===

*1864&quot;, Stable three-quarter plate&quot;. In 1864, Ferdinand Adolph Lange introduced the three-quarter plate in his pocket watches. It replaced the many separate bridges which until then held the arbors of the going train. While this requires more time and effort during the assembly phase, it clearly improves the stability of the movement. Only the balance cock with the oscillation system remained exposed, located beneath a cock.
*1867&quot;, Jumping seconds hand&quot;. In 1867, Lange developed a jumping-seconds mechanisms for a pocket watch, which his sons Richard and Emil adapted slightly and filed for patent ten years later. Further patents include a keyless winding and hands-setting, a system for the removal of the mainspring barrel, a constant-force escapement, a chronograph, an aluminium balance-spring29 and a quarter repeater.
*1902&quot;, Grand Complication No. 42500&quot;. The Grand Complication was made in 1902 as a unique piece. It was sold to Heinrich Schäfer of Vienna for the price of 5600 Marks which at the time was the equivalent of a villa in Dresden, Germany. The watch houses 833 individual parts and features the following complications: chiming mechanism with grand and small strike (grande et petite sonnerie), minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph with minute counter, perpetual calendar with moon phase, flying seconds (seconde foudroyante), and so on. In 2001, the watch came back to Glashütte during a manufacture visit from customers who left it to the hands of the restoration workshop to be repaired. It took a team of five experts and almost seven years to renovate the watch as it was in 1902. In 2010, the restored piece was first exhibited at the &quot;Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH)&quot;. The watch is now on permanent loan in the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments) in Dresden.
*1931&quot;, Richard Lange&#x27;s&quot; &quot;balance spring patent&quot;. Elinvar balance spring&#x27;s introduction was revolutionary because it was removing the effects of temperature over the elasticity of the spring. After Emil Lange&#x27;s introduction of the nickel-steel balance to Germany, Richard Lange&#x27;s interest in the metallurgical aspect of watchmaking was awoken. He was the first to realise that adding beryllium to nickel and steel lessened the sensitivity of hairsprings to temperature fluctuations and magnetic fields on the one hand, while improving their elasticity and hardness in comparison with the Elinvar alloy springs. His patent application “Metal alloys for watch springs” in Germany and was granted in 1931. His invention created the base of the Nivarox balance springs that are still in use today.
*1997, &quot;Zero reset mechanism&quot;. In 1997, A. Lange &amp; Söhne introduced an advanced and elaborate self-winding movement: the Sax-0-Mat calibre features an integrated Zero-Reset mechanism that stops the balance when the crown is pulled and instantaneously moves the seconds hand to the zero position, much like in a chronograph.
*2005, &quot;Disengagement mechanism&quot;. With this invention, Lange&#x27;s split-seconds chronographs – Double Split and Triple Split – can be activated without causing a decline in amplitude. The mechanism prevents friction loss encountered in conventional solutions by separating the interlocking connection between the rattrapante hands and the chronograph hands on the chronograph centre arbor and on the minute counter arbor when the rattrapante button is actuated.
*2008&quot;, Stop-seconds for tourbillon.&quot; A. Lange &amp; Söhne is the only brand to find a way to stop the oscillating balance inside the revolving tourbillon cage to allow precise time setting in watches endowed with this complication. Pulling the crown triggers a complex lever ensemble that pivots a movable V-shaped spring into the balance rim. It instantly stops the balance. When the crown is pushed, the “brake” is released, and the balance instantly begins to oscillate again.
*2018&quot;, Triple-split chronograph&quot;. In January 2018, Lange introduced the &quot;triple-split&quot; chronograph, an advancement from Lange&#x27;s &quot;double-split&quot; chronograph introduced in 2004. The new chronograph can compare the times of two concurrent events, of up to twelve hours&#x27; duration and to the accuracy of one-sixth of a second. Being the world&#x27;s first mechanical split-seconds chronograph that allows multi-hour comparative time measurements, the watch also features Lange&#x27;s patented isolator mechanism to preserve the amplitude of the balance wheel while the chronograph is running to ensure precision at all times.

== Notable models ==
=== Most expensive pieces ===

*On November 12, 2007, an 18K-pink-gold A. Lange &amp; Söhne pocket watch (No. 46177) manufactured in 1904 was auctioned by Christie&#x27;s for around 0.95 million US dollars (1,057,000 CHF). The pocket watch contains complications such as minute repeater, perpetual calendar, split-second chronograph, and so on.
* On May 12, 2018, a unique A. Lange &amp; Söhne 1815 &quot;Homage to Walter Lange&quot; made in stainless steel was sold for US$852,525 in Phillips&#x27; Geneva auction. This is one of the auction records for Lange timepieces. The proceeds went to Children Action, a Swiss children&#x27;s relief organization. The watch model was introduced in 2018 to pay tribute to the late Walter Lange. It was limited to 263 pieces in total in the following metals: pink gold (145), white gold (90), yellow gold (27) and steel. Notably, it was the first 1815 model that included a jumping seconds hand, a complication first devised by the founder himself.
*In 2013, Lange introduced the &quot;Grand Complication,&quot; which boasts multifarious complications including a chiming mechanism with grand and small strike (grande et petite sonnerie), a minute repeater, a split-seconds chronograph with minute counter, and a perpetual calendar with moon phase and flying seconds (seconde foudroyante). Upon release, the piece was the most complicated wristwatch ever made in Germany. The retail price for the watch was million, and only six pieces have been produced. It took about a year for a master watchmaker to assemble the mechanism.

=== 1815 ===
In general, Lange 1815 is a family of wristwatches that pays a tribute to the legacy of Ferdinand Adolph Lange, who was born in the year 1815 and founded the company in 1845. The Lange 1815 family consists of watch models with complications such as chronograph, annual calendar, tourbillon, perpetual calendar and so on. The watches in this line take their roots from Lange pocket watches to the present time by using traditional elements like railway minute track, Arabic numerals and clubs-shaped markers on the 15-minute intervals. Additionally, a couple notable models of the Lange 1815 include the &quot;1815 &#x27;Homage to Walter Lange,&#x27;&quot; limited in production to just 263 time pieces, and the &quot;1815 Rattrapante Perpetual Calendar in Platinum,&quot; winner of the Grande Complication Prize and the Public Prize at the Grand Prix d&#x27;Horlogerie de Geneve.

=== Zeitwerk ===
Introduced in 2009, the Zeitwerk is the first mechanical watch that displays the time from left to right in a digital looking manner. Its designers had challenged everything, except mechanical principles, to come up with a patented mechanism that drove three precisely switching hour and minute discs. In November 2009, it was awarded the “Aigulle d’Or” at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève. Encouraged by the success, the watch was turned into a family of its own. The Zeitwerk range includes several watches with striking complications as well as a model featuring a ring-shaped date display.

=== Lange 1 ===
The Lange 1 is one of the first watch models introduced after A. Lange &amp; Söhne trademark was re-established in 1990s. It is a family of watches that boasts a unique decentralized and asymmetrical dial design, as well as the outsize date display. Specifically, the &quot;Lange 1&quot; model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key indicators: a dial displaying the hours and minutes, a smaller subsidiary dial displaying seconds, an oversized double window date display, and a power reserve indicator. The Lange 1 family is often regarded as one of the most iconic watch designs and has won 45 prizes since 1995.

At the &quot;Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) 2012&quot; in Geneva, A. Lange &amp; Söhne unveiled new watches including a take on the classic Lange 1. The Lange 1 watch family is to be headed by the Lange 1 Tourbillon Perpetual Calendar, with two large complications and a new type of instantaneously jumping month ring. The company also issued a reworked Grand Lange 1. In addition, there was a luminous Lange 1 Time Zone in white gold. Over the years, the Lange 1 has been evolved into a watch family composed of 15 models. They come in various case diameters and as manually wound or self-winding versions. The portfolio has been enriched with additional functions such as a moon-phase displays that are designed to remain accurate for 122.6 years, a second time zone, or as a combination featuring a tourbillon and a perpetual calendar (Lange 1 Perpetual Calendar Tourbillon). In 2019, the brand celebrated the Lange 1&#x27;s 25th anniversary with a series of limited editions.

<doc id="1256176" wikidata="Q722793" url="?curid=1256176" title="Frankie Vaughan">
<text>Frankie Vaughan (born Frank Fruim Abelson; 3 February 1928 – 17 September 1999) was an English singer and actor who recorded more than 80 easy listening and traditional pop singles in his lifetime. He was known as &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; after his signature song &quot;Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl&quot;. Two of Vaughan&#x27;s singles topped the UK Singles Chart – &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; (1957) and &quot;Tower of Strength&quot; (1961). He starred in several films, including a role opposite Marilyn Monroe in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (1960). 
==Life and career==

Vaughan was born Frank Fruim Abelson on Devon Street in the Islington district of Liverpool on 3 February 1928, one of four children of Isaac and Leah Abelson.

He came from a family of Russian Jewish descent and derived his stage surname from his grandmother; as he was her first-born grandson, she called him &quot;Frank my &#x27;number one&#x27; grandson&quot;, and her Russian accent made &quot;one&quot; sound like &quot;Vaughan&quot;. In his early life, he was a member of the Lancaster Lads&#x27; Club, a member group of the National Association of Boys&#x27; Clubs; having started out at the club intending to become a boxer, he was a major contributor to them during his career, dedicating his monetary compensation from one song each year to them. He was an evacuee during World War II.

He attended the Lancaster College of Art on a scholarship and was a vocalist in their dance band. After a stint in the Royal Army Medical Corps (where he spent most of his time boxing) he returned to art school, this time at the Leeds College of Art. An early appearance was in the Leeds students rag revue &quot;It&#x27;s Rag Time&quot;, which opened on 20 June 1949 at the Empire Theatre in Leeds, when he was described as the show&#x27;s main vocalist. He was still known as Frank Abelson at that time. When he won a prize in a design contest, he left for London, where he won second prize on a radio talent show. 

Vaughan auditioned for the agent Billy Marsh who booked him in for a week at the Kingston Empire in May 1950 with Jimmy Wheeler. His debut went well with press comment stating &quot;Frankie Vaughan gives a promising performance when singing some new and old songs in a crooning style. He receives a warm reception&quot;. This led to further bookings on the variety circuit and he appeared with the veteran male impersonator Hetty King on several occasions. Her guidance helped change Vaughan&#x27;s style for the rest of his career. He became known as a fancy dresser, wearing top hat, bow tie, tails, and cane.

Vaughan made his first television appearance on 13 October 1951 in a variety show from the Theatre Royal, Leeds starring Gracie Fields. He was introduced by Donald Peers and sang &quot;Lucky Me&quot;. 

He made his first records in 1950 for the His Master&#x27;s Voice, but they were not popular. In August 1952 he joined the dance band of Nat Temple for a year or so, but the popularity of further recordings he made in 1953 encouraged him to return to the variety stage. He switched to the Philips label and in 1955, he recorded what was to become his trademark song, &quot;Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl&quot;.

He recorded a large number of songs that were covers of United States hit songs, including Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Kewpie Doll&quot;, Jimmie Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Kisses Sweeter than Wine&quot;, Boyd Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Seventeen&quot; (also covered in the US by the Fontane Sisters), Jim Lowe&#x27;s &quot;The Green Door&quot;, and (with the Kaye Sisters), the Fleetwoods&#x27; &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot;. In 1956, his cover of &quot;The Green Door&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. The same year he was voted &#x27;Showbusiness Personality of the Year&#x27;. In early 1957, his version of &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot;, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1957, he was voted the eighth most popular star at the British box office.

Managed at this time by former journalist and theatrical agent Paul Cave, Vaughan stayed in the United States for a time to make a film with Marilyn Monroe, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (1960), and was an actor in several other films, but his recordings were never chart hits in the US, with the exception of &quot;Judy&quot;, which reached No.100 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1958. In 1961, Vaughan was on the bill at the Royal Variety Performance at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Coventry Street, London. That December, Vaughan hit No. 1 in the UK again, with &quot;Tower of Strength&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach and Bob Hilliard. The rise of beat music eclipsed Vaughan&#x27;s chart career before he returned to the Top 10 in 1967 with &quot;There Must Be a Way&quot;. Chart success eluded him after this although he did have two more Top 40 singles; &quot;Nevertheless&quot; and &quot;So Tired&quot;.

In the late 1960s, Vaughan, involved himself with a youth project in Easterhouse, Glasgow. He was appalled by the level of violence amongst young people. Vaughan held meetings with the gang leaders and appealed for them to surrender their weapons.

In 1985, Vaughan starred in a stage version of &quot;42nd Street&quot; at Drury Lane in London, opposite his old friend Shani Wallis who appeared in their first film together, &quot;Ramsbottom Rides Again&quot;. After a year, he nearly died of peritonitis and had to leave the cast. Vaughan was married to Leeds-born Stella Shock (1924–2022) from 1951 until his death; the couple had three children, a daughter Susan (b.1963) and two sons, singer and yoga elder David Sye (b.1961) and actor-singer Andrew Abelson (b.1968).

In 1994, he was one of a few to be honoured by a second appearance on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. Vaughan had been a subject of the show previously in April 1970 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him at the Caesar&#x27;s Palace nightclub in Luton.

Despite frequent bouts of ill-health, Vaughan continued performing until shortly before his death in 1999.

==Awards and honours==
Vaughan was awarded an OBE in 1965, a CBE in 1996, and as a long-time resident of High Wycombe had been a Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire since 1993. He was an Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University. He also received the Variety Club of Great Britain Award for &quot;Showbusiness Personality of the Year&quot; in 1957.

==Death==
Vaughan died from heart failure at his home in High Wycombe aged 71. His wife Stella donated archival materials, including scores and sheet music he had collected throughout his career, to Liverpool John Moores University in 2000.

<text>Covedale is a former village in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States. The main area of the village was annexed by the city of Cincinnati and is now a neighborhood of about 15,000 people in the western part of the city.

==History==
Covedale was annexed by Cincinnati on June 4, 1930. Residents of the annexed territory unsuccessfully argued in Common Pleas Court that the annexation date was March 18, 1931. Upon annexation, the village disincorporated and its remaining area reverted to Green Township, with a small fragment going to Delhi Township.

==Geography==
Covedale is located about west of downtown Cincinnati. It is primarily a residential neighborhood of tree lined streets with brick and Tudor-style homes. Commercial areas are mainly centered about Glenway Avenue.

The U.S. Census provides population and demographic data for the area that remains in the townships, Covedale (CDP).

<text>Lieutenant General Akwasi Amankwaa Afrifa (24 April 1936 – 26 June 1979) was a Ghanaian soldier, farmer, traditional ruler and politician. He was the head of state of Ghana and leader of the military government in 1969 and then chairman of the Presidential Commission between 1969 and 1970. He continued as a farmer and political activist. He was elected a member of Parliament in 1979, but he was executed before he could take his seat. He was executed together with two other former heads of state, General Kutu Acheampong and General Fred Akuffo, and five other generals (Utuka, Felli, Boakye, Robert Kotei and Amedume), in June 1979. He was also popularly referred to by his title &quot;Okatakyie&quot; Akwasi Amankwaa Afrifa and was in addition the &quot;abakomahene&quot; of Krobo in the Asante-Mampong Traditional Area of the Ashanti Region of Ghana.

==Education and training==

After his secondary education at Adisadel College, he joined the Ghana Army in 1957 and was sent to the Regular Officer&#x27;s Special Training School. From there, he attended the Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot, England in 1958. He then completed officer training at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England. In 1961, he was at the School of Infantry, Hythe, United Kingdom.

Afrifa also attended the Defence College, at Teshie in Accra.

==Career==

In 1960, Afrifa was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Ghana Armed Forces. From 1962 up to 1964, he was a general staff officer in the army. He next attended the Defence College, at Teshie in Accra. Afrifa was one of the officers who served in the Ghana contingent of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. Afrifa rose through the ranks to become a major. He was also staff officer in charge of army training and operations by 1965. He was based at Kumasi, at the headquarters of the Second Infantry Brigade (now the Central Command) of the Ghana Army.

==Politics==

===24 February 1966 coup===

 While at Kumasi, Afrifa became friends with Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, then a colonel and the commander of the Second Infantry Brigade. At the time, Ghana had become a one-party state, political opposition was effectively removed with the Preventive Detention Act of 1958 and in 1964 Kwame Nkrumah declared himself president for life. Simultaneously, the export price of Ghana&#x27;s main foreign exchange earner, cocoa, plummeted. This, combined with ambitious domestic expenditure on much needed social infrastructure and on well documented white elephants such as the Volta dam, led to the bankruptcy of Ghana. There was a lot of discontent among the general population as prices rocketed for basic consumer goods which were widely unavailable, and among the Ghana Armed Forces. Nkrumah had asked the military at the time to prepare for a possible campaign in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) due to that country&#x27;s recent unilateral declaration of independence under a white minority regime. Under the pretext of a training exercise, Kotoka moved his troops from Kumasi to Accra for the coup. Afrifa was his right-hand man in the coup exercise. It turned out later that, unhappy with Nkrumah&#x27;s strengthening ties with the Soviet Union, China and other communist states, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States had been kept updated about preparations for this coup and may have helped create difficulties for the Nkrumah government to facilitate this. The coup plotters struck while Nkrumah was on a trip to Hanoi, then the capital of North Vietnam. Afrifa&#x27;s brief was to take the Broadcasting House, the base from which the national radio station broadcast its news and programmes. This succeeded after heavy fighting, allowing Kotoka to go on air to announce the coup d&#x27;état to the whole nation.

===Allegations of atrocities===

There have been allegations by members of Nkrumah&#x27;s Presidential Detail Department (PDD) responsible for the personal protection of Nkrumah that they were physically tortured, some apparently in the presence of Kotoka, J. W. K. Harlley and Afrifa. Martin Okai, a member of the PDD, claimed at the National Reconciliation Commission hearings that his torture was supervised by Afrifa.

===Time in government===

Following the coup, Kotoka became one of the eight members of the National Liberation Council (NLC). Afrifa also went through a series of rapid promotions rising from major to lieutenant general in the three years his government was in power. He was also appointed the commissioner (minister) for Finance and Trade. The head of state of Ghana and chairman of the NLC, Joseph Arthur Ankrah was forced to resign in April 1969 following a bribery scandal involving Francis Nzeribe, a Nigerian businessman. He was replaced by Afrifa as head of state. Ankrah was accused of effecting payments to influence the results of a poll which showed him ahead of Afrifa and Kofi Abrefa Busia for the national elections due in August 1969. Afrifa was a supporter of Busia, the leader of the Progress Party who was a candidate in the forthcoming National Assembly elections. Afrifa handed over to Busia who became the prime minister of Ghana on inauguration of the Second Republic. He continued as chairman of the newly created Presidential Commission until August 1970 when he was replaced by Nii Amaa Ollennu, the speaker of Parliament in the Second Republic.

===Campaign for democracy===

After the overthrow of the democratically elected Busia government by Acheampong and the National Redemption Council, Afrifa, a known supporter of Busia was arrested two days later on 15 January 1972 and detained until December 1972. Following his release, Afrifa restricted himself largely to farming at his home town of Mampong. In 1978, the Supreme Military Council (SMC) government sought to introduce a new and widely criticized political system called Union Government (UNIGOV) which was to be a military and civilian partnership rather than a return to a multi-party democracy. A referendum was scheduled in March 1978, and Afrifa was one of the leaders of the Popular Movement for Freedom and Justice, which led the opposition to this UNIGOV concept. Joined by students and the intelligentsia among others, the PMFJ demanded a return to constitutional multi-party democracy.

===Elected member of Parliament===

Following the fall of Acheampong, the new SMC under General Fred Akuffo organized presidential and parliamentary elections on 18 June 1979 for a multi-party national assembly. The elections were, however, held under the government of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) as the SMC itself had been overthrown on 4 June 1979. Afrifa stood for and won the Mampong North constituency seat on the ticket of the United National Convention, whose roots were from the Progress Party of Kofi Abrefa Busia. On 26 June 1979, eight days after his election, Afrifa was executed and thus never had the opportunity to take his seat in the Parliament of the Third Republic of Ghana and was succeeded in parliament by Ebenezer Augustus Kwasi Akuoko.

==Other roles==

The late Asantehene (Asante king), Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, honoured Afrifa with the title &quot;okatakyie&quot; (meaning &quot;hero&quot; in Asante) after the NLC had returned power to the civilian Busia government. Afrifa was also the &quot;abakomahene&quot; of Krobo in the Asante-Mampong Sekyere Traditional Area in the Ashanti Region. Afrifa is also credited with initiating the Krobo Rehabilitation Project, raising funds leading to the rebuilding of the entire village.

==Family==

Afrifa was the son of Opanin Kwaku Amankwa and Ama Serwaa Amaniampong, both from Krobo, near Mampong, in the Ashanti Region. At the time of his execution, he was married to Christine Afrifa, with whom he had nine children. His first Ama Serwa Afrifa, seven with Christine Afrifa; Baffour Afrifa, Baffour Anokye Afrifa, Maame Drowaa Afrifa, Serwaa Adimam Afrifa, Ayowa Afrifa, Sophia Amaniampong Afrifa and Akosua Afrifa. His last son Henry Afrifa was born after his death.

==Execution==

===Premonitions===

Afrifa had written a letter to Acheampong expressing fears about the future execution of soldiers as a deterrent against the staging of military coups in Ghana, due to the prevailing corruption and indiscipline in the military. This was around the period of the UNIGOV campaign and before Acheampong was removed in a palace coup on 5 July 1978.
I feel greatly disturbed about the future after the government ... In order to discourage the military from staging coups in the future, how about if they line all of us up and shot us one by one? I do not certainly want to be arrested, given some sort of trial and shot. But I would be a stupid General if I sit in the comfort of my farm and await the VENGEANCE that is about to be unleashed on us. ... I will pray to take away the fear and confusion weighing on my mind now.

====Execution====

After the overthrow of the SMC by the AFRC led by Jerry Rawlings, Afrifa was again arrested on his farm at Mampong. Together with other arrested senior military officers, they were tried to varied extents in camera. They were apparently found guilty of corruption, embezzlement, and using their positions to amass wealth. The investigations carried out were apparently incomplete. Evidence gathered by the National Reconciliation Commission in 2004 also suggests that the others executed were not properly tried. Previously, Afrifa had personally had his assets probed by the independent Sowah Assets Commission without any adverse findings. There also appears to have been a delay to the executions as no one including Rawlings appears to have been ready to sign the death warrants. Lieutenant General Joshua Hamidu, a former chief of the Defence Staff at the time of the AFRC regime, stated that he and Rawlings were the only soldiers at the centre of government who opposed the executions of the former heads of state. He is quoted as saying in response to an accusation of calling for Afrifa&#x27;s execution that: 
That is ridiculous. It is a lie. I had nothing to do with the executions. For three weeks after the 4 June event, questions were constantly raised about executing people. I always stood against it. Surprisingly, the only person who also stood against it was Rawlings. The young boys wanted blood and I used to tell &quot;you cannot resurrect the man once you&#x27;ve killed him. If you have any case against people, try them. Let everybody hear what they have done wrong against the country.&quot; And that even, they could not do. 
On 26 June 1979, Afrifa was executed by firing squad, together with General Fred Akuffo, also a former head of state and Major General Robert Kotei, Colonel Roger Felli, Air Vice Marshal George Yaw Boakye and Rear Admiral Joy Amedume. Reports suggest that Afrifa did not die immediately and had to be shot again. The bodies of the executed officers were buried without ceremony at the Nsawam Prisons Cemetery at Adoagyiri, near Nsawam in the Eastern Region.

===Reburial===

Following a petition by the widows of the executed generals, President John Kufuor decided that their bodies be returned to their respective families as part of a national reconciliation. On 27 December 2001, the bodies were returned to their respective families in Accra. Afrifa&#x27;s remains were finally laid to rest at his hometown of Krobo on 28 January 2002.

<text>Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the &quot;figure&quot;), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network.

Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.

==Related disciplines and history==

Fields other than cartography, such as psychology, neurology, and computer science, have studied differentiation of figure from ground. Many studies have employed different experiments, varying the shades, textures, and orientations of test pictures to determine the best method for figure–ground design with mixed results. A current application of figure–ground research is the development of computer vision for robots. By studying the way humans perceive figure and ground, methods can be developed to improve computer vision algorithms. Unlike some of these other applications, in which figures and grounds are &quot;discovered&quot; in a natural visual field that may or may not have this contrast, in cartography they are intentionally &quot;created&quot; by design, based on knowledge of the visual perception tendencies of map readers.

Since the early days of academic cartography, there has been a recognition of the need for maps to have a conceptual structure. In &quot;The Look of Maps&quot; (1952), Arthur Robinson emphasized the need for visual contrast in making maps that are clearly organized, including the figure-ground relationship, &quot;the visual relation of one or more components to the background on which they are seen.&quot; In 1972, Borden Dent appears to have been the first to use the principles of perceptual psychology to develop a theory of how the figure-ground relationship emerges on maps (as well as Visual hierarchy), and a set of guidelines for design to strengthen it. He identified heterogeneity (contrast), Contour (strong edges), Area (size) and Enclosedness (closure) as the primary determinants of figure identification, a model that gained wide support, soon becoming a core principle of the cartographic canon found in textbooks (including his own). He tied it directly to the idea of &quot;visual levels&quot;, the illusion that some elements on the map appear to float above the page, suggesting that figures are &quot;above&quot; their ground. This correlation has also gained widespread, if not universal, acceptance, even though there are common situations when figures appear below their ground (such as a river beneath a road network).

Further research was largely grounded in Gestalt psychology and perception, which largely corroborated and expanded upon Dent&#x27;s model. In summarizing the work to date, MacEachren added Orientation and Convexity to Dent&#x27;s list, with the acknowledgment that these are relatively minor influences compared to the others. MacEachren discussed the concept of visual levels as &quot;related,&quot; but not equal, to figure-ground contrast.

==Influences on figure–ground contrast==

Several visual patterns are believed to contribute to figure-ground contrast, such that features that exhibit these patterns are easier to recognize as figures. These have been largely adopted from Gestalt psychology.
* Differentiation or heterogeneity, the amount of difference in appearance between the intended figure and the intended ground. A strong figure looks significantly different than everything in the ground, while the elements of the ground look relatively similar to each other. This can be accomplished using almost any of the visual variables, such as color, size, and texture. Achieving difference is more important than using prescribed design techniques on the figure and ground; for example, a dark figure stands out on a light background just as much as a light figure stands out on a dark background.
* Closure, the appearance of a figure to be completely contained within the visual field, and thus entirely surrounded by ground. A figure with closure stands out because it looks like &quot;a thing.&quot; The proclivity for closed objects is so strong in human visual processing that humans will perceive closure even when figures are only mostly closed.
* Centrality, in which features near the center of the visual field (the map) are easier to isolate as figures than features on the edge. The concept of centrality is important because the object located in the center of a map is most often assumed to be the figure. Other map elements can be centered in the remaining visual space after the figure has been centered.
* Size, in which smaller elements are more easily recognized as figures than those that fill the visual field. This is one of the few factors in which figure-ground and visual hierarchy have opposite effect.
* Interposition is when some features appear to be &quot;in front&quot; of others in the visual field, with the former partially obscuring the latter. The former thus has a stronger recognition as a figure. This property could be considered a more complex use of closure.
* Articulation utilizes texture to differentiate figure from ground. One common example of using articulation on a map is differentiating a continent from the ocean. The ocean, in most cases, will be the ground and the continent will be the figure. By adding fine-textured shading to water, the continent pops out visually as the figure. Another method that can be employed for articulation is called vignetting, or the inclusion of brightness gradients at the land-water edge.
* Contour is the strength of the boundary or edge of a figure. The figure is formed by a contour or outline (as opposed to an isometric contour line), the common boundary between the figure and ground, usually through a brightness contrast. If a figure is not separated entirely from the ground, a simple black contour line can be drawn around the figure enclosing it and thus differentiating it from the ground.

==Relationship to visual hierarchy==
The concept of figure-ground contrast is often confused with the concept of visual hierarchy. Both are related elements of map composition, the same design techniques frequently achieve both goals simultaneously, and they are synergistic in that strengthening one typically has the side effect of strengthening the other. The primary difference is in intent. Figure-ground contrast is about making each feature appear &quot;distinct&quot; from the rest of the features in the map, while visual hierarchy is about making each feature appear more or less &quot;important&quot; than the rest of the features in the map.

<text>Noël Godin (born 13 September 1945) is a Belgian writer, critic, actor and notorious pie thrower or &quot;entarteur&quot;. Godin gained global attention in 1998 when his group ambushed Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in Brussels, pelting the software magnate with pies. After bombarding Gates, Godin allegedly said, &quot;My work here is done.&quot; He has been described as &quot;the French-speaking world’s best-known prankster.&quot;

== Philosophy ==
Godin insists he is non-violent and is careful to use only soft pies made of cream and sponge cake that will not physically hurt his victims, which he purchases from local bakeries. He says his humor can be traced back to Bugs Bunny, Wile E. Coyote, the Marx Brothers, Norman Wisdom, and the radical &quot;yippies&quot; of the Youth International Party.

A supporter of anarchist causes, Godin targets figures representing elites whom the public has turned against. One of his favorite targets is the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, who has been pied by Godin or one of his accomplices on at least seven occasions.

== Pieing targets ==
Since 1969, Godin has thrown pies at more than 25 people in the fields of culture, politics, and beyond. The list of public figures Godin and his accomplices have targeted with pies includes:

* Marguerite Duras (1969)
* Maurice Béjart (1969)
* Marco Ferreri (1976)
* Jean-Luc Godard (1985)
* Bernard-Henri Lévy (at least seven times, including 1985, 1994, 2015)
* (1993)
* Patrick Bruel (1993)
* Jean-Pierre Elkabbach (1994)
* Hélène (1995)
* Philippe Douste-Blazy (1995)
* Daniel Toscan du Plantier (1996)
* Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor (1996)
* Priests at Nantes Cathedral (1996)
* Nicolas Sarkozy (1997)
* Bill Gates (1998)
* Bernard Landry (2000)
* Jean-Pierre Chevènement (2002)
* Jean Charest (2003)

<text>Peter Dennis Mitchell FRS (29 September 1920 – 10 April 1992) was a British biochemist who was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his theory of the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis.

==Education and early life==
Mitchell was born in Mitcham, Surrey on 29 September 1920. His parents were Christopher Gibbs Mitchell, a civil servant, and Kate Beatrice Dorothy (née) Taplin. His uncle was Sir Godfrey Mitchell, chairman of George Wimpey. He was educated at Queen&#x27;s College, Taunton and Jesus College, Cambridge where he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos specialising in Biochemistry.

He was appointed a research post in the Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, in 1942, and was awarded a Ph.D. in early 1951 for work on the mode of action of penicillin.

==Career and research==
In 1955 he was invited by Professor Michael Swann to set up a biochemical research unit, called the Chemical Biology Unit, in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Edinburgh, where he was appointed a Senior Lecturer in 1961, then Reader in 1962, although institutional opposition to his work coupled with ill health led to his resignation in 1963.

From 1963 to 1965, he supervised the restoration of a Regency-fronted Mansion, known as Glynn House, at Cardinham near Bodmin, Cornwall - adapting a major part of it for use as a research laboratory. He and his former research colleague, Jennifer Moyle founded a charitable company, known as Glynn Research Ltd., to promote fundamental biological research at Glynn House and they embarked on a programme of research on chemiosmotic reactions and reaction systems.

===Chemiosmotic hypothesis===
In the 1960s, ATP was known to be the energy currency of life, but the mechanism by which ATP was created in the mitochondria was assumed to be by substrate-level phosphorylation. Mitchell&#x27;s chemiosmotic hypothesis was the basis for understanding the actual process of oxidative phosphorylation. At the time, the biochemical mechanism of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was unknown.

Mitchell realised that the movement of ions across an electrochemical potential difference could provide the energy needed to produce ATP. His hypothesis was derived from information that was well known in the 1960s. He knew that living cells had a membrane potential; interior negative to the environment. The movement of charged ions across a membrane is thus affected by the electrical forces (the attraction of positive to negative charges). Their movement is also affected by thermodynamic forces, the tendency of substances to diffuse from regions of higher concentration. He went on to show that ATP synthesis was coupled to this electrochemical gradient.

His hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of ATP synthase, a membrane-bound protein that uses the potential energy of the electrochemical gradient to make ATP; and by the discovery by André Jagendorf that a pH difference across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast results in ATP synthesis.

==== Protonmotive Q-cycle ====
Later, Peter Mitchell also hypothesized some of the complex details of electron transport chains. He conceived of the coupling of proton pumping to quinone-based electron bifurcation, which contributes to the proton motive force and thus, ATP synthesis.

===Awards and honours===
In 1978 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his contribution to the understanding of biological energy transfer through the formulation of the chemiosmotic theory.&quot; He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974.

<doc id="1256189" wikidata="Q3394687" url="?curid=1256189" title="Password policy">
<text>A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly. A password policy is often part of an organization&#x27;s official regulations and may be taught as part of security awareness training. Either the password policy is merely advisory, or the computer systems force users to comply with it. Some governments have national authentication frameworks that define requirements for user authentication to government services, including requirements for passwords.

==NIST guidelines==

The United States Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has put out two standards for password policies which have been widely followed.

===2004===
From 2004, the &quot;NIST Special Publication 800-63. Appendix A,&quot; advised people to use irregular capitalization, special characters, and at least one numeral. This was the advice that most systems followed, and was &quot;baked into&quot; a number of standards that businesses needed to follow.

===2017===
However, in 2017 a major update changed this advice, particularly that forcing complexity and regular changes is now seen as bad practice.

The key points of these are:

* Verifiers &quot;shall not&quot; impose composition rules (e.g., not require mixtures of different character types and not prohibit consecutively repeated characters) (note that this was changed in revision 4 from &quot;should not&quot; to &quot;shall not&quot;)
* Verifiers &quot;shall not&quot; require passwords to be changed arbitrarily or regularly (e.g. no 90-day or 365-day change rule) 
* Passwords &quot;must&quot; be at least 8 characters in length 
* Password systems &quot;should&quot; permit subscriber-chosen passwords at least 64 characters in length. 
* All printing ASCII characters, the space character, and Unicode characters &quot;should&quot; be acceptable in passwords
* When establishing or changing passwords, the verifier &quot;shall&quot; advise the subscriber that they need to select a different password if they have chosen a weak or compromised password
* Verifiers &quot;should&quot; offer guidance such as a password-strength meter, to assist the user in choosing a strong password
* Verifiers &quot;shall&quot; store passwords in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords &quot;shall&quot; be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function. Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive.

NIST included a rationale for the new guidelines in its Appendix A.

==Aspects==
Typical components of a password policy include:

===Password length and formation===
Many policies require a minimum password length. Eight characters is typical but may not be appropriate. Longer passwords are almost always more secure, but some systems impose a maximum length for compatibility with legacy systems.

Some policies suggest or impose requirements on what type of password a user can choose, such as:

*the use of both upper-case and lower-case letters (case sensitivity)
*inclusion of one or more numerical digits
*inclusion of special characters, such as @, #, $
*prohibition of words found in a password blocklist
*prohibition of words found in the user&#x27;s personal information
*prohibition of use of company name or an abbreviation
*prohibition of passwords that match the format of calendar dates, license plate numbers, telephone numbers, or other common numbers

Other systems create an initial password for the user; but require then to change it to one of their own choosing within a short interval.

===Password block list===
Password block lists are lists of passwords that are always blocked from use. Block lists contain passwords constructed of character combinations that otherwise meet company policy, but should no longer be used because they have been deemed insecure for one or more reasons, such as being easily guessed, following a common pattern, or public disclosure from previous data breaches. Common examples are Password1, Qwerty123, or Qaz123wsx.

===Password duration===
Some policies require users to change passwords periodically, often every 90 or 180 days. The benefit of password expiration, however, is debatable. Systems that implement such policies sometimes prevent users from picking a password too close to a previous selection.

This policy can often backfire. Some users find it hard to devise &quot;good&quot; passwords that are also easy to remember, so if people are required to choose many passwords because they have to change them often, they end up using much weaker passwords; the policy also encourages users to write passwords down. Also, if the policy prevents a user from repeating a recent password, this requires that there is a database in existence of everyone&#x27;s recent passwords (or their hashes) instead of having the old ones erased from memory. Finally, users may change their password repeatedly within a few minutes, and then change back to the one they really want to use, circumventing the password change policy altogether.

The human aspects of passwords must also be considered. Unlike computers, human users cannot delete one memory and replace it with another. Consequently, frequently changing a memorized password is a strain on the human memory, and most users resort to choosing a password that is relatively easy to guess (See Password fatigue). Users are often advised to use mnemonic devices to remember complex passwords. However, if the password must be repeatedly changed, mnemonics are useless because the user would not remember which mnemonic to use. Furthermore, the use of mnemonics (leading to passwords such as &quot;2BOrNot2B&quot;) makes the password easier to guess.

Administration factors can also be an issue. Users sometimes have older devices that require a password that was used before the password duration expired. In order to manage these older devices, users may have to resort to writing down all old passwords in case they need to log into an older device.

Requiring a very strong password and not requiring it be changed is often better. However, this approach does have a major drawback: if an unauthorized person acquires a password and uses it without being detected, that person may have access for an indefinite period.

It is necessary to weigh these factors: the likelihood of someone guessing a password because it is weak, versus the likelihood of someone managing to steal, or otherwise acquire without guessing, a stronger password.

Bruce Schneier argues that &quot;pretty much anything that can be remembered can be cracked&quot;, and recommends a scheme that uses passwords which will not appear in any dictionaries.

===Sanction===
Password policies may include progressive sanctions beginning with warnings and ending with possible loss of computer privileges or job termination. Where confidentiality is mandated by law, e.g. with classified information, a violation of password policy could be a criminal offense in some jurisdictions. Some consider a convincing explanation of the importance of security to be more effective than threats of sanctions.

==Selection process==
The level of password strength required depends, among other things, on how easy it is for an attacker to submit multiple guesses. Some systems limit the number of times a user can enter an incorrect password before some delay is imposed or the account is frozen. At the other extreme, some systems make available a specially hashed version of the password, so that anyone can check its validity. When this is done, an attacker can try passwords very rapidly; so much stronger passwords are necessary for reasonable security. (See password cracking and password length equation.) Stricter requirements are also appropriate for accounts with higher privileges, such as root or system administrator accounts.

===Usability considerations===
Password policies are usually a tradeoff between theoretical security and the practicalities of human behavior. For example:
*Requiring excessively complex passwords and forcing them to be changed frequently can cause users to write passwords down in places that are easy for an intruder to find, such as a Rolodex or post-it note near the computer.
*Users often have dozens of passwords to manage. It may be more realistic to recommend a single password be used for all low security applications, such as reading on-line newspapers and accessing entertainment web sites.
*Similarly, demanding that users never write down their passwords may be unrealistic and lead users to choose weak ones (or cause a lot of inconvenience when users forget their password). An alternative is to suggest keeping written passwords in a secure place, such as a safe or an encrypted master file. The validity of this approach depends on what the most likely threat is deemed to be. While writing down a password may be problematic if potential attackers have access to the secure store, if the threat is primarily remote attackers who do not have access to the store, it can be a very secure method.
*Inclusion of special characters can be a problem if a user has to log onto a computer in a different country. Some special characters may be difficult or impossible to find on keyboards designed for another language.
*Some identity management systems allow self-service password reset, where users can bypass password security by supplying an answer to one or more security questions such as &quot;where were you born?&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s your favorite movie?&quot;, etc. Often the answers to these questions can easily be obtained by social engineering, phishing or simple research.

A 2010 examination of the password policies of 75 different websites concludes that security only partly explains more stringent policies: monopoly providers of a service, such as government sites, have more stringent policies than sites where consumers have choice (e.g. retail sites and banks). The study concludes that sites with more stringent policies &quot;do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences from poor usability.&quot;

Other approaches are available that are generally considered to be more secure than simple passwords. These include use of a security token or one-time password system, such as S/Key, or multi-factor authentication. However, these systems heighten the tradeoff between security and convenience: according to Shuman Ghosemajumder, these systems all improve security, but come &quot;at the cost of moving the burden to the end user.&quot;

<doc id="1256194" wikidata="Q1142155" url="?curid=1256194" title="V-model">
<text>The V-model is a graphical representation of a systems development lifecycle. It is used to produce rigorous development lifecycle models and project management models. The V-model falls into three broad categories, the German &quot;V-Modell&quot;, a general testing model, and the US government standard.

The V-model summarizes the main steps to be taken in conjunction with the corresponding deliverables within computerized system validation framework, or project life cycle development. It describes the activities to be performed and the results that have to be produced during product development.

The left side of the &quot;V&quot; represents the decomposition of requirements, and the creation of system specifications. The right side of the &quot;V&quot; represents an integration of parts and their validation. However, requirements need to be validated first against the higher level requirements or user needs. Furthermore, there is also something as validation of system models. This can partially be done on the left side also. To claim that validation only occurs on the right side may not be correct. The easiest way is to say that verification is always against the requirements (technical terms) and validation is always against the real world or the user&#x27;s needs. The aerospace standard RTCA DO-178B states that requirements are validated—confirmed to be true—and the end product is verified to ensure it satisfies those requirements.

Validation can be expressed with the query &quot;Are you building the right thing?&quot; and verification with &quot;Are you building it right?&quot;

== Types ==
There are three general types of V-model.

=== V-Modell ===
&quot;V-Modell&quot; is the official project management method of the German government. It is roughly equivalent to PRINCE2, but more directly relevant to software development. The key attribute of using a &quot;V&quot; representation was to require proof that the products from the left-side of the V were acceptable by the appropriate test and integration organization implementing the right-side of the V.

=== General testing ===
Throughout the testing community worldwide, the V-model is widely seen as a vaguer illustrative depiction of the software development process as described in the International Software Testing Qualifications Board Foundation Syllabus for software testers. There is no single definition of this model, which is more directly covered in the alternative article on the V-Model (software development).

=== US government standard ===
The US also has a government standard V-model. Its scope is a narrower systems development lifecycle model, but far more detailed and more rigorous than most UK practitioners and testers would understand by the V-model.

== Validation vs. verification ==
It is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query &quot;Are you building the right thing?&quot; and verification by &quot;Are you building it right?&quot; In practice, the usage of these terms varies.

The PMBOK guide, also adopted by the IEEE as a standard (jointly maintained by INCOSE, the Systems engineering Research Council SERC, and IEEE Computer Society) defines them as follows in its 4th edition:
* &quot;Validation. The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with &quot;verification&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with &quot;validation&quot;.&quot;

== Objectives ==
The V-model provides guidance for the planning and realization of projects. The following objectives are intended to be achieved by a project execution:

* Minimization of project risks: The V-model improves project transparency and project control by specifying standardized approaches and describing the corresponding results and responsible roles. It permits an early recognition of planning deviations and risks and improves process management, thus reducing the project risk.
* Improvement and guarantee of quality: As a standardized process model, the V-model ensures that the results to be provided are complete and have the desired quality. Defined interim results can be checked at an early stage. Uniform product contents will improve readability, understandability and verifiability.
* Reduction of total cost over the entire project and system life cycle: The effort for the development, production, operation and maintenance of a system can be calculated, estimated and controlled in a transparent manner by applying a standardized process model. The results obtained are uniform and easily retraced. This reduces the acquirer&#x27;s dependency on the supplier and the effort for subsequent activities and projects.
* Improvement of communication between all stakeholders: The standardized and uniform description of all relevant elements and terms is the basis for the mutual understanding between all stakeholders. Thus, the frictional loss between user, acquirer, supplier and developer is reduced.

== V-model topics ==
=== Systems engineering and verification ===
The systems engineering process (SEP) provides a path for improving the cost-effectiveness of complex systems as experienced by the system owner over the entire life of the system, from conception to retirement.

It involves early and comprehensive identification of goals, a concept of operations that describes user needs and the operating environment, thorough and testable system requirements, detailed design, implementation, rigorous acceptance testing of the implemented system to ensure it meets the stated requirements (system verification), measuring its effectiveness in addressing goals (system validation), on-going operation and maintenance, system upgrades over time, and eventual retirement.

The process emphasizes requirements-driven design and testing. All design elements and acceptance tests must be traceable to one or more system requirements and every requirement must be addressed by at least one design element and acceptance test. Such rigor ensures nothing is done unnecessarily and everything that is necessary is accomplished.

=== The two streams ===

==== Specification stream ====
The specification stream mainly consists of:
* User requirement specifications
* Functional requirement specifications
* Design specifications

==== Testing stream ====
The testing stream generally consists of:
* Installation qualification (IQ)
* Operational qualification (OQ)
* Performance qualification (PQ)

The development stream can consist (depending on the system type and the development scope) of customization, configuration or coding.

== Applications ==

The V-model is used to regulate the software development process within the German federal administration. Nowadays it is still the standard for German federal administration and defense projects, as well as software developers within the region.

The concept of the V-model was developed simultaneously, but independently, in Germany and in the United States in the late 1980s:

* The German V-model was originally developed by IABG in Ottobrunn, near Munich, in cooperation with the Federal Office for Defense Technology and Procurement in Koblenz, for the Federal Ministry of Defense. It was taken over by the Federal Ministry of the Interior for the civilian public authorities domain in summer 1992.
* The US V-model, as documented in the 1991 proceedings for the National Council on Systems Engineering (NCOSE; now INCOSE as of 1995), was developed for satellite systems involving hardware, software, and human interaction.
* The V-model first appeared at Hughes Aircraft circa 1982 as part of the pre-proposal effort for the FAA Advanced Automation System (AAS) program. It eventually formed the test strategy for the Hughes AAS Design Competition Phase (DCP) proposal. It was created to show the test and integration approach which was driven by new challenges to surface latent defects in the software. The need for this new level of latent defect detection was driven by the goal to start automating the thinking and planning processes of the air traffic controller as envisioned by the automated enroute air traffic control (AERA) program. The reason the V is so powerful comes from the Hughes culture of coupling all text and analysis to multi dimensional images. It was the foundation of Sequential Thematic Organization of Publications (STOP) created by Hughes in 1963 and used until Hughes was divested by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1985.
* The US Department of Defense puts the systems engineering process interactions into a V-model relationship.

It has now found widespread application in commercial as well as defense programs. Its primary use is in project management and throughout the project lifecycle.

One fundamental characteristic of the US V-model is that time and maturity move from left to right and one cannot move back in time. All iteration is along a vertical line to higher or lower levels in the system hierarchy, as shown in the figure. This has proven to be an important aspect of the model. The expansion of the model to a dual-Vee concept is treated in reference.

As the V-model is publicly available many companies also use it. In project management it is a method comparable to PRINCE2 and describes methods for project management as well as methods for system development. The V-model, while rigid in process, can be very flexible in application, especially as it pertains to the scope outside of the realm of the System Development Lifecycle normal parameters.

== Advantages ==
These are the advantages V-model offers in front of other systems development models:

* The users of the V-model participate in the development and maintenance of the V-model. A change control board publicly maintains the V-model. The change control board meets anywhere from every day to weekly and processes all change requests received during system development and test.
* The V-model provides concrete assistance on how to implement an activity and its work steps, defining explicitly the events needed to complete a work step: each activity schema contains instructions, recommendations and detailed explanations of the activity.

== Limitations ==
The following aspects are not covered by the V-model, they must be regulated in addition, or the V-model must be adapted accordingly:

* The placing of contracts for services is not regulated.
* The organization and execution of operation, maintenance, repair and disposal of the system are not covered by the V-model. However, planning and preparation of a concept for these tasks are regulated in the V-model.
* The V-model addresses software development within a project rather than a whole organization.

<text>Albert Herring, Op. 39, is a chamber opera in three acts by Benjamin Britten.

Composed in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947, this comic opera was a successor to his serious opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;. The libretto, by Eric Crozier, was based on Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s novella &quot;Le Rosier de Madame Husson&quot;, with the action transposed to an English setting.

==Composition history==
After having composed and staged &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, Britten decided he should attempt a comedy, preferably set in England. Crozier suggested adapting the Maupassant short story &quot;Le rosier de Madame Husson&quot; and transplanting it to the Suffolk landscape already familiar to Britten from his home in Snape. Britten composed &quot;Albert Herring&quot; at his home, The Old Mill at Snape, in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947. He scored the opera for the same instrumental forces he had used in his first chamber opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, intending it like the earlier opera for performance by the English Opera Group.

==Performance history and reception==
The opera premiered on 20 June 1947 at Glyndebourne, conducted by the composer. According to one writer, the owner and founder of Glyndebourne, John Christie, &quot;disliked it intensely and is said to have greeted members of the first night audience with the words: &#x27;This isn&#x27;t our kind of thing, you know&#x27;.&quot; Some 38 years later Glyndebourne&#x27;s 1985 production was &quot;one of the most successful the opera has had&quot;.

The opera received its U.S. premiere on 8 August 1949 at the Tanglewood Music Festival. In 1949, Britten&#x27;s English Opera Group toured with both &quot;Rape of Lucretia&quot; and &quot;Albert Herring&quot;, giving ten performances between 12 and 23 September in Copenhagen and Oslo. An almost complete recording of one of the Copenhagen performances has been released commercially.

Sviatoslav Richter called it &quot;the greatest comic opera of the century&quot; and in 1983 staged &quot;Albert Herring&quot; as part of the December Nights Festival at Moscow&#x27;s Pushkin Museum.

The opera was performed at Buenos Aires&#x27;s Teatro Colón in 1972. The Chicago premiere was given by Chicago Opera Theater in 1979. In 2008–2010, over 55 performances were given by companies such as those at Glyndebourne and the Portland Opera in Oregon (2008 season); the Opéra-Comique in Paris and the Opéra de Normandie in Rouen (2009);and, for 2010, at the Landestheater in Linz, the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki and the Santa Fe Opera. The Santa Fe production was given by the Los Angeles Opera in 2011. Vancouver Opera presented the work, in a co-production with Pacific Opera Victoria, in 2013.

==Australian television production==
Australian television aired a live performance in 1959. This was at a time when Australian TV productions were rare.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Time: April and May 1900
:Place: Loxford, a small market town in East Suffolk, England

===Act 1===
Housekeeper Florence Pike is run ragged. Her mistress Lady Billows is organising the annual May Day festival and has gathered all the important people of the village to elect the May Queen. But Florence has dug up dirt on every single girl nominated, proving that none is worthy to wear the once-much-coveted crown. Lady Billows is depressed. Superintendent Budd suggests that the solution may be to select, this year, a May King instead. He knows of a young man in town who is as certainly virginal as the girls are not: Albert Herring.

Working at the greengrocer&#x27;s, Albert is teased for his timidity by the easygoing butcher Sid. Sid&#x27;s girlfriend Nancy comes in to do some shopping, and the couple shares a tender moment while Albert looks on. The lovers leave, and Albert reflects on his miserable existence under his mother&#x27;s thumb. The Festival Committee arrives with the news of his selection as May King. Mrs. Herring is thrilled by the prize of £25, but Albert balks at being paraded in swan-white and mother and son quarrel to the mocking commentary of the village children.

===Act 2===
It is the day of the festival. Sid and Nancy are preparing the banquet tent, and they take the opportunity to slip some rum into Albert&#x27;s lemonade glass. Together with a crown of flowers and the gruesome but improving Foxe&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Martyrs&quot;, Albert is awarded twenty-five pounds in prize money. Asked to make a speech, he is tongue-tied and becomes an object of pity at the feast in his honour, but after draining his lemonade glass (which Britten satirically underlines with a Tristan chord, alluding to the philter in that opera). and having a fit of hiccups he manages a few hip-hip, hurrahs.

That night, Albert arrives home alone and quite drunk. In the street, Sid keeps a rendezvous with Nancy, and the two discuss their sympathetic pity for Albert before going off together. This is the breaking point for Albert, who has overheard. He takes the prize money and heads out looking for adventure.

===Act 3===
The next morning Albert has not returned, and the village is in a panic. Superintendent Budd is leading the search, while the guilt-stricken Nancy tends to Mrs. Herring. A boy shouts that a &quot;Big White Something&quot; has been found in a well, and the village worthies file in to break the news &quot;en masse&quot; that Albert&#x27;s crown of flowers has been discovered, crushed by a cart. A lengthy threnody of grief follows, but is interrupted by the surprise return of Albert. He thanks the Festival Committee for funding his night out. They, in turn, are outraged by his tale of drunken debauchery and leave in a huff. Albert finally stands up to his mother and invites the village children into the shop to enjoy some fruit at his expense.

==Musical style and character themes==
&quot;Albert Herring&quot; is a musically complex work, despite its somewhat light-hearted subject matter. The text is genuinely humorous, and the score, while matching the text in character, includes myriad musical quotations as well as some complex forms. Like &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and other works by Britten, this opera explores society&#x27;s reaction to an odd individual, although, in this case at least, it is from a generally humorous and lighthearted perspective. Some of Britten&#x27;s contemporaries saw in the title character a satirical self-portrait of the composer.

== Recordings ==
There are five audio recordings of &quot;Albert Herring&quot; and one DVD recording, with the following artists:

<text>The Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS) was an early geographic information system (GIS) developed for the Government of Canada beginning in the early 1960s. CGIS was used to store geospatial data for the Canada Land Inventory and assisted in the development of regulatory procedures for land-use management and resource monitoring in Canada.

At that time, Canada was beginning to realize problems associated with its large land mass and attempting to discern the availability of natural resources. The federal government decided to launch a national program to assist in management and inventory of its resources. The simple automated computer processes designed to store and process large amounts of data enabled Canada to begin a national land-use management program and become a foremost promoter of geographic information systems (GIS).

CGIS was designed to withstand great amounts of collected data by managing, modeling, and analyzing this data very quickly and accurately. As Canada presented such large geospatial datasets, it was necessary to be able to focus on certain regions or provinces in order to more effectively manage and maintain land-use. CGIS enabled its users to effectively collect national data and, if necessary, break it down into provincial datasets. Early applications of CGIS benefited land-use management and environmental impact monitoring programs across Canada.

==Development==
In 1960, Roger Tomlinson was working at Spartan Air Services, an aerial survey company based in Ottawa, Ontario. The company was focused on producing large-scale photogrammetric and geophysical maps, mostly for the Government of Canada. In the early 1960s, Tomlinson and the company were asked to produce a map for site-location analysis in an east African nation. Tomlinson immediately recognized that the new automated computer technologies might be applicable and even necessary to complete such a detail-oriented task more effectively and efficiently than humans. Eventually, Spartan met with IBM offices in Ottawa to begin developing a relationship to bridge the previous gap between geographic data and computer services. Tomlinson brought his geographic knowledge to the table as IBM brought computer programming and data management.
The Government of Canada began working towards the development of a national program after a 1962 meeting between Tomlinson and Lee Pratt, head of the Canada Land Inventory (CLI). Pratt was charged with creation of maps covering the entire region of Canada&#x27;s commercially productive areas by showing agriculture, forestry, wildlife, and recreation, all with the same classification schemes. Not only was the development of such maps a formidable task, but Pratt understood that computer automation may assist in the analytical processes as well. Tomlinson was the first to produce a technical feasibility study on whether computer mapping programs would be a viable solution for the land-use inventory and management programs, such as CLI. He is also given credit for coining the term &quot;geographic information system&quot; and is recognized as the &quot;Modern Father of GIS.&quot;

CGIS continued to be developed and operated as a stand alone system by the Government of Canada until the late 1980s, at which point the widespread emergence of commercial GIS software slowly rendered it obsolete. In the early 1990s, a group of volunteers successfully extracted all of the data from the old computer tapes, and the data made available on GeoGratis.

<doc id="1256201" wikidata="Q557935" url="?curid=1256201" title="Spalacidae">
<text>The Spalacidae, or spalacids, are a family of rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. They are native to eastern Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and southeastern Europe. It includes the blind mole-rats, bamboo rats, mole-rats, and zokors. This family represents the oldest split (excluding perhaps the Platacanthomyidae) in the muroid superfamily, and comprises animals adapted to a way of life. These rodents were thought to have evolved adaptations to living underground independently until recent genetic studies demonstrated they form a monophyletic group. Members of the Spalacidae are often placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea.

==Characteristics==
Spalacids are mouse- to rat-sized rodents, adapted to burrowing and living underground. They have short limbs, wedge-shaped skulls, strong neck muscles, large incisor teeth, and small eyes and external ears. In the zokors, which dig primarily with their feet, rather than their teeth, the front claws are also massively enlarged. These features are least extreme in the bamboo rats, which spend at least some of their time above ground, foraging for food. They are most highly developed in the blind mole-rats, whose eyes are completely covered by skin, and entirely lack external ears or tails.

All of the spalacid species dig extensive burrows, which may include storage chambers for food, latrine chambers, and breeding nests. They are generally solitary animals, and do not share their tunnel complexes with other individuals. All the species are herbivores, feeding on roots, bulbs, and tubers.

They give birth to litters of up to six young after a gestation period between three and seven weeks, depending on the species. As with many other muroids, the young are born blind, hairless, and helpless. They may stay with the mother for several months before setting off to establish their own burrows, although some species disperse as soon as they are weaned.

===Characteristics===
Norris &quot;et al.&quot; listed several characteristics present in all members of this family which distinguish them from the rest of the muroids, (the clade Eumuroida). These are &quot;the reduction or absence of external eyes, reduced pinnae, stocky body, short tail (&lt;50% head and body length), broad rostrum, triangular-shaped braincase, infraorbital canal ovoid shape and does not extend ventrally to the roof of the palate, zygomatic plate absent or much reduced, nasolacrimal canal inside infraorbital canal, incisive foramina small to medium-sized, extensive neck musculature and prominent points of attachment on the occipitum, minimal reduction in M3 relative to M1 and M2, and a distinct orientation of the manubrium of the malleus bone.&quot; Spalacid genomes also share a derived filovirus-like nucleoprotein element with an open reading frame. 

==Classification==
The spalacids are classified in three subfamilies, six genera, and 37 species.

<doc id="1256202" wikidata="Q484700" url="?curid=1256202" title="Seongdeok of Silla">
<text>Seongdeok Daewang (reigned 702–737) was the thirty-third king of the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. He was the second son of King Sinmun, and the younger brother of King Hyoso. In 704 Seongdeok married Lady Baeso 陪昭夫人 (Queen Seongjeong 成貞), the daughter of Gim Wontae. In 715 their son, Junggyeong 重慶, was named Crown Prince and heir presumptive. Shortly thereafter, and for reasons unclear but quite likely having to do with a power struggle at court between the king and the clan of the queen, Queen Seongjeong was evicted from the palace in 716. As further evidence of a possible power struggle, the next year Junggyeong died under circumstances that remain unknown. Following the fall from favor of his first wife, King Seongdeog married Sodeok in 720, the daughter of the minister Gim Sun-won. Kings Hyoseong and Gyeongdeok were among the children of Seongdeok and Sodeok.

Despite suggestions of continued power struggles between aristocratic and royal prerogative, the reign of King Seongdeok is seen by most Korean scholars as the apogee of the Unified Silla state. Relations between Silla and Tang China reached unparalleled levels of cooperation. This accommodation following years of confrontation and competition over hegemony in Korea had much to do with Tang&#x27;s realization that Silla would prove more valuable as an ally on its flank than as a rival, during a period when Tang was facing continued challenges to its authority in the far west and on the northern steppes – by Tibet, the Malgal, dynamic Islamic forces emerging out of Central Asia, as well as the state of Balhae, which had emerged in the late 7th century from the ruins of the old Goguryeo state. Indeed, troubled by an increasingly confrontational Balhae (which had actually launched a seaborne attack against Tang in 733), in 733 the Tang emperor Xuanzong enfeoffed King Seongdeok as Military Commander of Ninghai (&quot;Ninghai junshi&quot; 寧海軍使) with orders to chastise the Balhae/Malgal state. Though King Seongdeok did in fact launch a northern campaign that same year, it was foiled by a blizzard.

Silla, too, was concerned by the Balhae resurgence. In 721 King Seongdeok ordered the construction of vodka aqueducts across Silla&#x27;s northern border. Remnants of this wall can still be seen in what is today South Hamgyong Province, North Korea. Plagued as well by the raids of Japanese pirates along the southern coast, the following year (and quite likely with the same laborers) Seongdeok also had a large fortress erected near the capital of Gyeongju that extended ten kilometers in circumference. According to the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, a 13th-century Korean record of history and fable that deals with the period in question, the fortress (known as Mobeol prefectural fortress) required the labor of nearly 40,000 men, a massive mustering of manpower that is testimony of the increasing power of the centralized monarchy.
The reign of Seongdeok also bears evidence of continued attempts at reforming the land system of Silla. The dispersal of &quot;able–bodied land&quot; (&quot;jeongjeon&quot; 丁田) is first mentioned as taking place in the twenty–first year of King Seongdeok (722). The exact nature of able–bodied land is disputed since almost no corroborating evidence remains. However, based on the title, it would seem to be land distributed to able bodied commoners, though whether to work or own outright is unclear. In any case, whatever its precise nature, it would appear to be an attempt to buttress royal authority by nurturing relations with the peasantry at the expense of the land holding aristocracy.

In fitting culmination to Seongdeok&#x27;s reign, and symptomatic of improving relations with Tang, in 735 Tang Emperor Xuanzong formally granted the Silla king the territory south of the Pae River (the modern Taedong River running through Pyongyang), land that had been held at least formally by Tang ever since the 7th century and the Tang–Silla campaigns that had toppled Goguryeo.

Seongdeok&#x27;s reign was one of relative prosperity and peace. As one Korean scholar has contended, during his rule &quot;...the paramount authority of the throne was finally secured, and with this accomplished the kingdom at last was able to enjoy unaccustomed domestic tranquility.&quot;.

According to one account in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, Seongdeok invented Korea&#x27;s first water clock, in Korean &quot;nugak &quot; 漏刻, in 718. However, this is likely a mistaken rendering of Nugakjeon 漏刻典, for elsewhere the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; relates that in 718 was established for the first time the Nugakjeon, or Office of Timekeeping. Regarding the death date of Seongdeok, as period Chinese histories record that in the second month of 737 a Tang envoy was dispatched to confer investiture upon Seongdeok&#x27;s successor (later King Hyoseong) as King of Silla, it has been posited that King Seongdeok in fact died in 736.

<doc id="1256207" wikidata="Q2667635" url="?curid=1256207" title="Cessna AT-17 Bobcat">
<text>The Cessna AT-17 Bobcat or Cessna Crane is a twin-engine advanced trainer aircraft designed and made in the United States, and used during World War II to bridge the gap between single-engine trainers and larger multi-engine combat aircraft. The commercial version was the Model T-50, from which the military versions were developed. Additional versions and names include the AT-8 trainer, UC-78 transport and bomber, and the Crane Mk.I in Canadian service.

==Design and development==

In 1939, three years after Clyde Cessna retired, the Cessna T-50 made its first flight, becoming the company&#x27;s first twin-engine airplane, and its first retractable undercarriage airplane. The prototype T-50 first flew on 26 March 1939, and was issued Approved Type Certificate 722 on 24 March 1940.

The AT-8, AT-17, C-78, UC-78, and Crane were military versions of the commercial Cessna T-50 light transport. The Cessna Airplane Company first produced the wood and tubular steel, fabric-covered T-50 in 1939 for the civilian market, as a lightweight and lower cost twin for personal use where larger aircraft such as the Beechcraft Model 18 would be too expensive. A low-wing cantilever monoplane, it featured retractable main landing gear and trailing edge wing flaps, both electrically actuated via chain-driven screws. The retracted main landing gear left some of the wheels extended below the engine nacelle for emergency wheel-up landings. The wing structure was built around laminated spruce spar beams, truss-style spruce and plywood ribs, and plywood wing leading edges and wing tips. The fixed tailwheel is not steerable, but can be locked straight. The Curtiss Reed metal fixed-pitch propellers were soon replaced with Hamilton Standard 2B-20-213 hydraulically-actuated, constant-speed, non-featherable propellers. Power was provided by two Jacobs L-4MB radial engines rated at for takeoff. Production began in December 1939.

==Operational history==

===US military===
On 19 July 1940, United States Assistant Secretary of War Louis A. Johnson ordered 33 AT-8 trainers, based on the T-50 for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Modifications included cockpit roof windows, more powerful Lycoming R-680 engines and military radios. The first AT-8 was delivered to the USAAC in December 1940, and in late 1941, the US Army ordered an additional 450 AT-17s, based on the T-50. Modifications included additional cockpit windows and Jacobs R-755-9 engines. Production for the U.S. Army Air Corps continued under the designation AT-17 reflecting a change in equipment and engine types. In 1942, the U.S. Army Air Force (the successor to the Air Corps from June 1941) ordered the Bobcat as a light transport as C-78s, which were redesignated as UC-78s on 1 January 1943. By the end of World War II, Cessna had produced more than 4,600 Bobcats for the U.S. Army, 67 of which were transferred to the United States Navy as JRC-1s. The Navy used the aircraft primarily for shuttling crews of ferry flights to and from their home bases. The Bobcat was given the nickname &quot;Bamboo Bomber&quot; in US service. Few Bobcats were still in service with the United States Air Force when it was formed in September 1947, and the type was declared obsolete in 1949.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
In September 1940, the Royal Canadian Air Force ordered 180 Crane Mk.I trainers, Cessna&#x27;s largest order to date. Modifications for the RCAF included Hartzell fixed-pitch wooden propellers, removable cylinder head baffles, and oil heaters. The first Crane Mk.I was delivered to the RCAF in November 1940, and Cessna then received an additional order from the RCAF for 460 more Crane Mk.Is. An additional 182 AT-17A were received by the RCAF through lend-lease, operated under the designation Crane Mk.IA, bringing the total produced for the RCAF to 822, which were operated under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). 

===Other operators===

In addition to military orders, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA, precursor to the FAA) ordered 13 T-50s, and Pan American Airways ordered 14 T-50s. Aircraft operated by the US military and by the RCAF were retired shortly after the end of the war and many were exported worldwide including to Brazil and the Nationalist Chinese. 

After the war, surplus AT-17s and UC-78s could be converted with CAA-approved kits to civilian-standard aircraft allowing their certification under the original T-50 approved type certificate. They were used by small airlines, charter and bush operators, and private pilots. Some were operated on floats. By the 1970s, the number of airworthy aircraft had dwindled as they were made obsolete by more modern types and by the maintenance required by their aging wood wing structures and fabric covering. Since then, several have been restored by antique airplane enthusiasts.

As of December 2017, FAA records show 52 T-50s, two AT-17s, and five UC-78s listed on its registration database.

===Notable appearances in media===
It was featured in the popular television series &quot;Sky King&quot; of the early-to-mid 1950s. The aircraft was replaced in later episodes by the T-50&#x27;s successor, the all-metal Cessna 310. One also stood in for Japanese twin engine bombers in the low level attack scene on the US PT boat base in the 1963 film, &quot;PT-109&quot;

<doc id="1256208" wikidata="Q586911" url="?curid=1256208" title="Rune poem">
<text>Rune poems are poems that list the letters of runic alphabets while providing an explanatory poetic stanza for each letter. Four different poems from before the mid-20th century have been preserved: the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem, the Norwegian Rune Poem, the Icelandic Rune Poem and the Swedish Rune Poem.

The Icelandic and Norwegian poems list 16 Younger Futhark runes, while the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem lists 29 Anglo-Saxon runes. Each poem differs in poetic verse, but they contain numerous parallels between one another. Further, the poems provide references to figures from Norse and Anglo-Saxon paganism, the latter included alongside Christian references. A list of rune names is also recorded in the &quot;Abecedarium Nordmannicum&quot;, a 9th-century manuscript, but whether this can be called a poem or not is a matter of some debate.

The rune poems have been theorized as having been mnemonic devices that allowed the user to remember the order and names of each letter of the alphabet and may have been a catalog of important cultural information, memorably arranged; comparable with the Old English sayings, Gnomic poetry, and Old Norse poetry of wisdom and learning.

==Rune poems==
===English===

The Old English Rune Poem as recorded was likely composed in the 7th century and was preserved in the 10th-century manuscript Cotton Otho B.x, fol. 165a – 165b, housed at the Cotton library in London, England. In 1731, the manuscript was lost with numerous other manuscripts in a fire at the Cotton library. However, the poem had been copied by George Hickes in 1705 and his copy has formed the basis of all later editions of the poems.

George Hickes&#x27; record of the poem may deviate from the original manuscript. Hickes recorded the poem in prose, divided the prose into 29 stanzas, and placed a copper plate engraved with runic characters on the left-hand margin so that each rune stands immediately in front of the stanza where it belongs. For five of the runes (&quot;wen&quot;, &quot;hægl&quot;, &quot;nyd&quot;, &quot;eoh&quot;, and &quot;Ing&quot;) Hickes gives variant forms and two more runes are given at the foot of the column; &quot;cweorð&quot; and an unnamed rune (&quot;calc&quot;) which are not handled in the poem itself. A second copper plate appears across the foot of the page and contains two more runes: &quot;stan&quot; and &quot;gar&quot;.

Van Kirk Dobbie states that this apparatus is not likely to have been present in the original text of the Cotton manuscript and states that it&#x27;s possible that the original Anglo-Saxon rune poem manuscript would have appeared similar in arrangement of runes and texts to that of the Norwegian and Icelandic rune poems.

===Norwegian===
The Norwegian Rune Poem was preserved in a 17th-century copy of a destroyed 13th-century manuscript. The Norwegian Rune Poem is preserved in skaldic metre, featuring the first line exhibiting a &quot;(rune name)(copula) X&quot; pattern, followed by a second rhyming line providing information somehow relating to its subject.

===Icelandic===
The Icelandic Rune Poem is recorded in four Arnamagnæan manuscripts, the oldest of the four dating from the late 15th century. The Icelandic Rune Poem has been called the most systemized of the rune poems (including the &quot;Abecedarium Nordmannicum&quot;) and has been compared to the &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; verse form.

The Icelandic rune poem is shown below with English translation side-by-side from Dickins:

===Swedish===
The Old Swedish rune poem is possibly the youngest of the four, first being recorded in a letter that was published in 1908. The text may be corrupt and it has received relatively little attention from runologists.
==&quot;Abecedarium Nordmannicum&quot;==

Recorded in the 9th century, the &quot;Abecedarium Nordmannicum&quot; is the earliest known catalog of Norse rune names, though it does not contain definitions, is partly in Continental Germanic and also contains an amount of distinctive Anglo-Saxon rune types. The text is recorded in Codex Sangallensis 878, kept in the St. Gallen abbey, and may originate from Fulda, Germany.

==The Rune Poem Puzzle from the Old Bø Church==

In the Old Bø Church in Telemark it is preserved a runic inscription, which uses lines, similar to Rune poems. By guessing the names of runes described in those lines, and reading the lines backwards, you get name of the woman, who the rune-rister fell in love with. The main lines of the puzzle are following:

Reading the lines from bottom upwards, reader gets following runes:
* ᚴ (sótt er barna)
* ᚢ (fjón svínkanda)
* ᚦ (fjalls íbúi)
* ᚱ (hests ærfaði)
* ᚢ (auk høys víti)
* ᚿ (þræls vansæla)
These runes together make the name Gudrun, who, according to the inscription, took the author′s sleep.

<text>Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Miles (née Squire; 19 August 1931 - 30 January 1993) was a Welsh poet and activist in the Deaf community. Throughout her life, she composed her poems in English, British Sign Language, and American Sign Language. Her work laid the foundations for modern sign language poetry in the United States and the United Kingdom. She is regarded as the pioneer of BSL poetry and her work influenced many contemporary deaf poets.

Miles studied at Gallaudet College. From 1957 to 1977, she lived as an expatriate in the United States and worked in education as well as writing. She joined the National Theatre of the Deaf in the US near the time of its founding in 1967. She later returned to the United Kingdom, where she became a key member of the British Deaf Community. By the early 1990s, Miles was experiencing manic depression. In 1993, Miles died by suicide, falling from a second-floor window.

== Biography ==
Miles (née Squire) was born 19 August 1931 in Holywell, Flintshire, North Wales, daughter of James and Amy Squire (née Brick). She was the youngest of five surviving children. In 1939 she contracted cerebrospinal meningitis, which left her deaf. She was educated at the Royal School for the Deaf and the Mary Hare School. In 1957, aged 25, she went to the United States to take up a place at Gallaudet College, sponsored in part by the British Deaf and Dumb Association. During her time at the college she became the first member of a junior class to be a member of the Gallaudet Phi Alpha Pi honour society, was in the 1961 edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in American Colleges and Universities&quot;, edited the student magazines and won prizes for both her prose writing and poetry and for acting. Some of her work was published in &quot;The Silent Muse&quot;, an anthology of selected writings by deaf authors of the last 100 years. She also wrote the Bison&#x27;s song.

She married a fellow student, Robert Thomas Miles, in September 1958. They separated in 1959. She graduated in 1961 receiving a BA with distinction. She worked in the United States as a teacher and counsellor for deaf adults. In 1967, she joined the newly founded National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD) and began to create sign language poetry that deaf people – as well as hearing people – could appreciate. First a wardrobe mistress, she first acted with NTD in 1968 in their production of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, whose script she also helped to translate. Miles also worked with NTD&#x27;s Little Theatre of the Deaf, which produced shows for children and teenagers. 

Miles graduated from Connecticut College with a master&#x27;s degree in 1974; her thesis was titled &quot;A History of Theatre Activities in the Deaf Community of the U.S.&quot;.

In 1975, Miles left the NTD to work with the campus service for the deaf at California State University, Northridge. She returned to live in England in the autumn of 1977, after twenty years in the United States. Miles was soon involved in the National Union of the Deaf&#x27;s pioneering television programme &quot;Open Door&quot; (in which she performed her poem &quot;Language for the Eye&quot;) and was involved in discussions that led to the &quot;See Hear&quot; television series. She took work with the British Deaf Association, working on various projects. She compiled the first teaching manual for BSL tutors and became involved in setting up the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP). She also worked on the BDA dictionary.

For a while she worked as a self-employed writer, lecturer and performer, becoming involved in promotion of sign language teaching and training of tutors and deaf theatre. She was involved in setting up and then teaching on the British Sign Language Tutor Training Course – the first university course for training deaf people to become BSL tutors. She also wrote the best-selling BBC book &quot;BSL – A beginner&#x27;s guide&quot;, which was published to complement the television series.

== Death ==
By the early 1990s, Miles was a key figure in the British Deaf Community. She died on 30 January 1993 when she fell from the window of her second-floor flat. The inquest at St. Pancras Coroner&#x27;s Court concluded that she killed herself while experiencing manic depression.

== Legacy ==
Miles is regarded as a key figure in the literary heritage of sign language and the deaf community. It has been suggested that she is the source of most of the sign language poetry performed today. She was passionate about deaf issues, culture and sign language and longed to bridge the gap between deaf and hearing people.

She features as one of a series of portraits of notable deaf artists painted by Nancy Rourke.

The Dorothy Miles Cultural Centre was established by a group of both Deaf and hearing friends in her memory. It was an organisation based in Surrey, spreading British Sign Language and raising Deaf Awareness in the community. This mantle was taken up by Dot Sign Language, which took over when the Cultural Centre closed. Dot Sign Language continues to teach qualifying British Sign Language courses in Woking and Guildford, as well as Deaf Awareness workplace training. They spend many hours working in the community, in Schools, Scout troops, Brownies and all other youth groups, so that all youngsters can see BSL in action, in real life and interact with Deaf people. They have such a high pass rate and such teaching methods that they were shortlisted for award and recognition in January 2017 by the examining body &#x27;Signature&#x27;.

In April 2024 a Purple Plaque (celebrating Remarkable Women in Wales) was unveiled outside Miles&#x27;s childhood home, 27 Westbourne Avenue, Rhyl by her niece, Liz Deverill.

On 19 August 2024, the 93rd anniversary of her birth, Miles was honoured with a Google Doodle created by Deaf artist Youmee Lee.

<text>The Criticize Lin (Biao), Criticize Confucius Campaign (; also called the Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius campaign) was a political and intellectual campaign started by Mao Zedong and his wife, Jiang Qing, the leader of the Gang of Four. It lasted from 1973 until the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976.

The campaign continued in several phases, beginning as an academic attempt to interpret Chinese history according to Mao&#x27;s political theories. In 1974 the campaign was joined with another, pre-existent campaign to criticise Lin Biao, who had allegedly attempted to assassinate Mao in a failed coup before his death in 1971. In early 1975 the campaign was modified to indirectly criticise China&#x27;s Premier, Zhou Enlai, and other senior Chinese leaders. In mid-1975 the Gang of Four introduced debate on &quot;Water Margin&quot; as a tool for criticism of their opponents. The campaign ended in 1976, when the Gang of Four were arrested.

==Stages of the campaign==

The events that occurred during the &quot;Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius&quot; campaign were &quot;complex and often confusing&quot;, but can be identified as occurring through four main phases. The first phase of the campaign began after the 1st Plenary Session of the 10th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in 1973. Following this session, Mao encouraged public discussions focused on criticizing Confucius and Confucianism, and on interpreting aspects of historical Chinese society within a Maoist theoretical perspective. 

These initial debates focused on interpreting the issues of slavery, feudalism, and the relationship between Confucianism and Legalism according to the social theories published by Mao and Karl Marx. Confucius himself was condemned as a defender of slavery and a denigrator of women who had hindered China&#x27;s development by resisting historical progress.

In late 1973 to early 1974 the second phase of the campaign began, when the Chinese public were encouraged to adopt criticism of Confucius in a great &quot;study campaign&quot;. The universities were mobilized to deliver special courses to workers and peasants, State propaganda photographs depicted Chinese farmers supposedly carrying on &quot;intense debates&quot;. 

The criticisms of Confucius merged with a pre-existent campaign to criticize Lin Biao, who was condemned as a &quot;capitalist roader&quot; by his enemies among a radical faction of the Party led by Jiang Qing. With the deployment of the campaign it became clear that &quot;criticism of Lin Biao and Confucius&quot; was directed not so much against the &quot;enemies of the past,&quot; as against the &quot;enemies of today.&quot; During this phase, Mao&#x27;s image was identified with that of China&#x27;s first emperor, Qin Shihuang (glossed as an anti-Confucian Legalist). Praise was given to Qin based on his popular association with Mao. Mao described Lin as a &quot;closet Confucianist&quot;, &quot;bourgeois careerist&quot;, conspirator, and &quot;ultra rightist&quot;. 

The revolutionary operas (yangbanxi) were used as an ideological tool during the campaign, and their promotion through official state channels surged in 1974. 

The third phase began after Zhou Enlai reorganized the State Council during the 4th National People&#x27;s Congress, in January 1975. At the People&#x27;s Congress, Zhou brought many cadres back to work who had been forced out of power during the 1966–1969 phase of the Cultural Revolution. In comparison with the first stage of the Cultural Revolution, the rehabilitated leaders led by Zhou were able to exercise significant influence.

Feeling strong support from his supporters on 31 January 1974 at the enlarged meeting of the Politburo, Zhou was able to strongly request not to involve the armed forces in a campaign for &quot;four great freedoms&quot;, namely, writing, free expression of opinions and extensive discussion, and general criticism. Deng Xiaoping, who was among those rehabilitated under Zhou, sought to turn the campaign back against the radical faction by linking Confucius to resistance to modernisation and better education – goals that Deng was pursuing at the time, against the radicals&#x27; opposition.

Because they had supported the purging of many career Communist Party veterans during the early Cultural Revolution, the radical faction, now dominated by the Gang of Four, opposed Zhou&#x27;s efforts and began to subtly criticize him and his policies. In particular, they used the ongoing anti-Confucius campaign to attack the 12th century BC Duke of Zhou, a major figure in Confucianism, whose name recalled that of Zhou Enlai.

The fourth and final phase of the campaign coincided with Zhou&#x27;s illness and hospitalization. After 1974, the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius reached its climax, and soon subsided. However, beginning in the summer of 1975 the Gang of Four started a new campaign, introducing public debates on &quot;The Water Margin&quot; and the &quot;war on empiricism&quot; as a tool to criticise Zhou and their other enemies, notably Deng, which sidelined &quot;criticism of Confucius.&quot; Deng Xiaoping then took many of Zhou&#x27;s responsibilities, acting as premier in Zhou&#x27;s absence until Deng was again forced out of power, in 1976. 

After Mao died, the Gang of Four also directed a campaign against Hua Guofeng, who was named Mao&#x27;s successor. The campaign ended with Hua&#x27;s arrest of the Gang of Four, in October 1976. The Anti-Lin, Anti-Confucius campaign was the last campaign of the Maoist era, and with the demise of the Gang of Four, such campaigns were largely abandoned as a feature of Chinese politics.

==Theoretical focus==
A main theoretical focus of the campaign was to advance the principle articulated by Mao that the masses are the motive force of history.

Although the campaign was used as a political tool by the Gang of Four, it did produce a genuine attempt to interpret historical Chinese society within the context of Mao&#x27;s political theories. Maoist theorists attempted to use what they knew about the stone-age Dawenkou culture to produce evidence that a slave society had existed in Chinese history, just as Mao had described. These Maoist theorists used the recurrent patterns of peasant revolts, which have occurred throughout Chinese history, as evidence that the common people had consistently rejected both feudalism and the Confucian ideology that supported it. After their vitriolic denunciations of Confucianism, radical theorists attempted to interpret all of Chinese history as a long episode of conflict between the forces of Confucianism and Legalism, and attempted to identify themselves as modern Legalists.

During the campaign, critique groups formed at Tsinghua University and Peking University; they produced commentaries under the name &quot;Liang Xiao,&quot; a pseudonym that sounds like a person&#x27;s name but which is a homophone for &quot;two schools.&quot;

The campaign was an intense moment in 20th Century Chinese intellectual history, combining both specialist scholarship and with an openness to mass study. There was a spike in new political economy texts produced for a lay audience (as opposed to party members or university students), and mass dissemination of information made thousands of documents and articles available to ordinary Chinese, including worker-formed study &quot;groups for theory&quot; in factories. Workers writing groups also collaborated with specialists on drafting texts, such as the 1976 &quot;Political Economy in Front of the Smelting Furnace&quot; (&quot;Lianganglu qian de zhengzhi jingjixue&quot;) by the theory group of Shanghai Number 5 Steel Factory and the Fudan University philosophy and economics departments. The campaign resulted in reprints and new editions of classic Legalist writings as well as historical reconstructions of their debates with the Confucians. It also provided the impetus for archeological excavations.

== Local level ==
Ordinary people in China generally viewed the campaign as an attack on elitism in China&#x27;s Confucian tradition, particularly given the campaign&#x27;s denunciation of the Confucian principle &quot;shang zun xia yu er bu yi&quot; (meaning that it is a general rule that the elites are respectable and the ordinary people are stupid).

During the campaign, some dormant radicals on the local level resumed political activities, one such example was the Hangzhou incident of 1975, which was put down with a massive deployment of troops.

<text>The 3rd Gorkha Rifles or Third Gorkha Rifles, abbreviated as 3 GR is an Indian Army infantry regiment. It was originally a Gurkha regiment of the British Indian Army formed in 1815. This regiment recruit mainly Magars and Gurung tribes. They were present at a number of actions and wars including the siege of Delhi in 1857 to the First and Second World Wars. After the Partition of India in 1947 the regiment was one of the six Gorkha regiments transferred to the Indian Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain at the time of Indian independence. Prior to independence, the regiment was known as the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles. In 1950 the regiment&#x27;s title was changed to 3rd Gorkha Rifles. Since 1947 the regiment has participated in a number of conflicts including the 1947 and 1971 wars against Pakistan.

== History ==

===Formation to 1885===
The regiment was raised during the Gurkha War by Sir Robert Colquhoun on 24 April 1815 as the Kemaoon Battalion. It did not consist entirely of Gurkhas but of men from Kumaon and Garhwal. The regiment adopted the tartan of the Clan Colquhoun.

The regiment was primarily used to police the border with Nepal, doing so for many decades until the Indian Mutiny began in 1857. The battalion was actively involved in the efforts to quell it. During the siege of Delhi—which lasted from March to September 1857—the regiment, part of Colonel Colin Campbell&#x27;s Third Column, took part in the storming of Kashmiri Gate and gained the Battle Honour &quot;Delhi 1857&quot;. The mutiny was quelled by July 1858.

The regiment, having been brought into the line of the Bengal Army, was briefly titled the 18th Bengal Native Infantry in 1861 before the regiment gained its present numeral designation when it became the 3rd Gurkha (The Kumaon) Regiment. The regiment saw service in an expedition to Bhutan shortly after the name change.

In 1878 the Second Afghan War began and the regiment, as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Kandahar Field Force, took part in the march to seize Kandahar. The field force successfully captured the city on 8 January 1879, having experienced great hardship on the march there. The following year the Kandahar Force began the march towards the Afghan capital Kabul to join Major-General Roberts force in an attempt to consolidate their situation in the country. During the journey, near Ghaziri, the force were attacked by a large force of Afghan tribesmen at Ahmad Khel on 19 April 1880. The fighting that ensued was intense and the field force&#x27;s situation was in the balance until the Afghan forces were successfully repulsed when the 3rd Gurkha formed an infantry square.

===1885–1914===
The regiment took part in the Third Burmese War after it began in 1885 and operations concluded by the following year under First Brigade. In 1887 the 2nd Battalion was formed, consisting entirely of Garhwalis, but this was separated from the regiment in 1890 to form the 39th (The Garhwal) Regiment of Bengal Light Infantry. A new 2nd Battalion for the 3rd Gurkha was raised that same year and in 1891 the regiment was designated a rifle regiment, becoming the 3rd Gurkha (Rifle) Regiment.

The 3rd Gurkhas took part in numerous campaigns in the volatile North-West Frontier, including the 1st Battalion&#x27;s participation in the storming of the Dargai Heights on 20 October 1897 during the Tirah Campaign. The battalion was part of the Tirah Field Force intended to put down a large tribal revolt by the Afridi and Orakzais, orchestrated by Afghanistan. The 3rd Gurkhas took part in the advance into the Tirah Region, meeting resistance from tribal forces before moving on to help relieve Fort Lockheart and Fort Gulistan. After this was done the force marched on Dargai where they intended to take the heights above Dargai, controlled by tribal forces.
The heights had originally been taken by the Tirah force on 18 October but they were ordered to withdraw, coming under attack as they did so and allowing the tribal force to return to the heights and strengthen their positions. The operation to retake the heights began with an artillery bombardment at 10:00 am on 20 October. The regiment took part in the initial assault, positioned at the forefront of the attack with the 2nd Gurkha Rifles and the 1st Dorsets. They advanced methodically, moving up the slopes until they charged towards the enemy but sustained heavy casualties and became pinned down. The battle raged on for hours until, after the tribal positions were subject to an artillery bombardment, a final charge was made by the 1st Gordons, followed by the Gurkhas and 3rd Sikhs. The tribal defenders wilted in the face of the charge and the heights were taken later that day.

In 1907 the title was changed to become the 3rd The Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles in honour of Alexandra of Denmark, queen consort of King Edward VII, and the following year the title became more specific when it became the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles.

===First World War===
In August 1914 the First World War began and the regiment&#x27;s battalions actively participated on the Western Front and in the Middle East.

In 1916, a clerical error gave the regiment a 4th Battalion when 4/3rd, instead of 3/4th, was written on the order for the raising of a battalion for the 4th Gurkha Rifles. The following year a 3rd Battalion for the 3rd Gurkhas was formed.

====Western Front====
The 2nd Battalion, as part of the 20th (Garhwal) Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division, was sent to France a few months after the declaration of war in 1914.

The battalion&#x27;s first large-scale action came at La Bassée that had commenced on 12 October as part of a period known as the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot;. The battalion was involved in the defence of Festubert in November and Givenchy in December, during a bitter winter that the Gurkhas were no doubt unaccustomed to having spent the pre-war period on the sub-continent.

The battalion remained on the Western Front until late 1915. At the Battle of Neuve Chapelle (10–13 March) the Garhwal Brigade advanced successfully during the initial offensive and the 2nd Battalion took part in fierce fighting during the battle. In May it was involved in the battles of Festubert and Aubers. In September the battalion took part in the Battle of Loos which saw the regiment awarded its first Victoria Cross. The VC action took place on 25 September when Rifleman Kulbir Thapa of the 2nd Battalion performed with distinction near the village of Fauquissart, becoming the first Gurkha recipient of the award.

The Battle of Loos was the battalion&#x27;s last action on the Western Front and it left the 7th Division with the rest of the Garhwal Brigade for Egypt in December 1915 after the brigade became an independent unit.

====Middle East====

After its arrival in Egypt the 2nd Battalion saw active service against the Ottoman Empire and later took part in the Palestine campaign, the second largest campaign by force totals during the First World War. It fought in the Autumn Offensive, seeing their first action during the Battles of Gaza. It was involved in many other actions during the campaign, including the Battle of Mughar Ridge in November 1917 and the capture of Jerusalem in December. On 19 September 1918, just a few months before the conclusion of the war, the Megiddo Offensive, began and the battalion was involved in the capture of Sharon. For its part in the campaign the 3rd Gurkhas gained seven Battle Honours and the Theatre Honour &quot;Palestine 1917–18&quot; after such honours were granted to units in the 1920s.

On 10 April 1918 at El Kefr in Egypt, Karanbahadur Rana of the 2nd Battalion became the regiment&#x27;s second VC recipient after distinguishing himself in an encounter with Ottoman forces, and was the last VC recipient of the regiment.

Elsewhere the 1st Battalion, from 1917, took part in the Mesopotamian Campaign (now Iraq), gaining only a single Battle Honour in the process. It was achieved at the last battle of the campaign, at the Battle of Sharqat (28–30 October 1918).

===Interwar period===
The First World War concluded with the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 but this gave the regiment no respite. It took part in the Third Afghan War in 1919 and spent much of their inter-war years in the North West Frontier and Burma.
The post-war reductions saw the regiment reduced to its pre-war establishment. The 3rd Battalion was disbanded in 1920 and the mistakenly raised 4th Battalion followed in 1922.

===Second World War===

The regiment was actively involved in Second World War and, as had happened during the First World War, the regiment was expanded to meet its commitments. The 3rd Battalion was re-raised in 1940, followed by the 4th Battalion in 1941. During the conflict, the regiment fought in a number of theatres, including North Africa, Italy and Burma. During the North African campaign, the 2nd Battalion fought at Tobruk, where they were brought in as reinforcements at the height of the battle and suffered misfortune almost immediately, when they were partially overrun by the Germans, losing almost two hundred men as prisoners of war, although many of these managed to escape later.

===Post Independence===
India gained its independence in 1947 and the regiment was one of six Gurkha regiments (out of 10) to be allocated to the Indian Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement between Britain, India and Nepal. The regiment retained its title until 1950 when India was proclaimed a Republic and the regiment became the &quot;3rd Gorkha Rifles&quot;. It remains in existence and consists of five battalions.

The Regiment won the Battle Honour &#x27;Pir Kanthi&#x27; in the Uri Sector in the war of 1948 and &#x27;Shingo&#x27; in the Kargil Sector in war of 1971. 1/3 GR has the distinction of being the first battalion in the post-independence period to carry out amphibious operations during the 1971 Indo-Pak War. Colonel J.R. Chitnis, CO 1/3 GR, was honoured with the Ashoka Chakra posthumously—India&#x27;s highest peacetime medal for valour—in Nagaland in 1956.

On 3 December 1997, a statue was unveiled in London in honour of the Gurkhas. A quote from Sir Ralph Turner, a former officer in the 3rd Gurkhas, was inscribed on the memorial: &quot;Bravest of the brave, most generous of the generous, never had country more faithful friends than you.&quot;

==Uniforms==
In its early years as the Kemaoon Battalion, the regiment wore green uniforms with white (after 1828 black) facings. As the 3rd Gurkhas from 1861, rifle green uniforms with black cuff facings were adopted to be worn with the round peakless Kilmarnock cap common to all Gurkha regiments. As was the practice with all Gurkha rifle regiments, black metal buttons and insignia were to remain features of the dress uniforms of the 3rd GR. Khaki drill was worn for active service and hot-weather dress from 1878 on. Shorts were adopted by the 3rd GR in 1900, at the same time as the wide brimmed &quot;Kashmir&quot; slouch hat came into general use. The latter had a green edged &quot;pugri&quot; (wide khaki band) as a regimental distinction. While the historic dark green ceased to be worn after World War I, except as part of officers&#x27; mess uniforms and a few other limited categories, the Kilmanock cap survived as a dress item until modern times.

<text>Brahma is a Brazilian beer, originally made by the Companhia Cervejaria Brahma, which was founded in 1888. In 1914, Brahma produced their national Malzbier. After that, the company began expanding internationally. The company bought the license for distribution of the Germania brand, which later was known as Guanabara, and was one of the earliest of the Brazilian beer brands.

In 1934, Brahma introduced the new bottled draft Brahma Chopp, and it became a Brazilian bestseller. In 1989, Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Telles bought Companhia Cervejaria Brahma for $50 million.

== Brahma ==
An interfaith coalition is pressing the world&#x27;s largest brewer to remove the name of a Hindu god (Brahma) from its beer brand. Brahma is a beer produced primarily for the Brazilian domestic market. Brahma was named after Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. Controversially, Brahma is now brewed in the Czech Republic.

<text>Roke, legally Roke Manor Research Ltd, is a British company based at Roke Manor near Romsey, Hampshire, which conducts research and development in the fields of communications, networks, electronic sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, Military decision support consultancy and operational analysis, information assurance, and human science. In addition to supporting its parent Chemring, Roke undertakes contract research and development, and product development work for both public and private sector customers. Products developed from research at Roke Manor include the Hawk-Eye ball tracker, which is now used widely in sports such as tennis, football, and cricket.

Roke has been part of the Chemring Group since 2010, having been founded as part of the Plessey company to operate as a dedicated research and development centre, with mass production elsewhere, and later owned for almost 20 years by Siemens where it had a similar research role.

==History==
*1956 – Founded as Plessey Research Roke Manor Limited by the Plessey company. The first managing director was Harold J. Finden, an electrical engineer at Plessey.
*1990 – Passed to GEC-Siemens AG in a joint takeover.
*1991 – Became wholly owned by Siemens AG when GEC sold their 50% shareholding to Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems.
*2010 – Acquired by the Chemring Group PLC.
*2021 – Roke made its first acquisition since the founding in 1956, acquiring Cubica Technology Ltd. and their holding company Cubica Group.

== Sites ==
The company&#x27;s head office is at Roke Manor, Hampshire. It also has facilities in the Barnwood area of Gloucester, Woking and in central Manchester.

The Roke Manor site is based around a manor house which dates in part from 1653. The grounds had a walled garden, stable block and cottages when bought by Plessey in 1956, and initially these were re-used for laboratory space and meeting rooms, but in various modernisation programmes, many of the original buildings have been demolished and much of the grounds covered by purpose-built facilities and car parking. The main house, entrance lodge and walled garden remain.

<text>Haneuljae (), also known as Gyerimnyeong () is a mountain pass in the Sobaek Mountains of central South Korea. It runs between Chungju in North Chungcheong province and Mungyeong in North Gyeongsang province. Haneuljae rises to about above sea level, between the peaks of Poam Mountain (963 m) and Juheul Mountain (1106 m).

During the Silla and Goryeo periods of Korean history, it played a role of critical importance, as the principal pathway between southeastern and southwestern Korea, and in particular between the valleys of the Han and Nakdong rivers. In the Joseon period, this role was taken over by the pass of Mungyeong Saejae, and Haneuljae fell into disuse. Today only a minor country road traverses the pass.

Seo (2001) contends that the pass played a particularly critical role in the diffusion of Buddhism into Silla from Goguryeo. The first monks bearing Buddhism to Silla came by land from the north, and Haneuljae would have been their most likely route. In addition, the area around Sangju; which would have been the first major city a traveler from the north would come to after crossing Haneuljae, became an early center of Buddhism, in contrast to the rest of Silla, which put up stiff resistance to the new faith.

The Chungju side of Haneuljae is currently protected as part of Woraksan National Park.

<doc id="1256231" wikidata="Q7820783" url="?curid=1256231" title="Tonda Traditional Bunraku Puppet Troupe">
<text>, founded in the 1830s, is one of the most active groups performing traditional &quot;ningyō jōruri&quot; or Bunraku puppetry in Japan, and has been officially designated an Intangible Cultural Treasure. 
In 2016, the current emperor, Naruhito visited Nagahama and the Tonda Puppet Troupe performed for him and his wife.

They are in possession of some of the oldest bunraku puppet heads after the National Bunraku Theater burned down. Their oldest heads are 250 years old and have a stamp branded into the handle.

Based in the northern part of the city of Nagahama near the shore of Lake Biwa, in Shiga Prefecture, northeast of Kyoto, the Tonda Puppets have made international performance tours to Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Germany, and thirteen times to the United States. The Tonda Troupe performs regularly at their own theater in Nagahama and on tour within Japan. The Tonda Puppet Troupe also instructs elementary school students in bunraku puppetry and hosts training sessions for local citizens interested in pursuing the art of the traditional puppet theater. The Tonda Troupe has also been active in training American college and university students in traditional Japanese puppetry in academic programs sponsored by such institutions as Berea College in Kentucky and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as well as the Japan Center for Michigan Universities, which is located in the nearby city of Hikone. In 2012 they also hosted a group of A-Level Theatre Studies students from Abingdon School and The School of St Helen and St Katharine, two independent schools in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.

==History==
The Tonda Troupe traces it origins to the 1830s, when an itinerant puppet troupe that had been traveling through the area was snowbound in the village of Tonda, where they had intended to offer a performance. Unable to continue their journey home to Tokushima or to draw a paying audience because of the snow, the members of the itinerant troupe fell further and further into debt to the villagers for food and shelter. When the weather broke, the unfortunate troupe left their puppets behind as collateral for a loan for the boat fare necessary to travel to the southwestern end of Lake Biwa and beyond. When years passed and the Tokushima puppeteers never returned to pay the debt and reclaim the puppets, the villagers finally formed their own puppet troupe, and by the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Tonda Puppet Troupe had itself become a semi-professional troupe that gave performances locally and on the road. Today, the Tonda Puppet Troupe still uses in performance many of the same puppet heads abandoned by the original snowbound troupe. Some of these puppet heads are over 200 years old, though the bodies and costumes, which wear more quickly, have been remade over the years.

For generations, membership in the Tonda Troupe was restricted to men from the four families who had been traditionally associated with the theater, but in the 1970s the troupe began to welcome both men and women from outside those families, and in 1993, the Tonda Puppets became the first traditional puppet troupe in Japan to admit a non-Japanese member. A theater building, the Tonda Puppet Hall (pictured above right), containing a full stage, as well as rehearsal and meeting spaces, was built for the Troupe in 1991 by the government of Shiga Prefecture. The Tonda Troupe is currently headed by Hidehiko Abe, who traces his ancestry back seven generations to one of the founding members of the troupe.

<text>The Challengers is an American game show that aired in syndication during the 1990-91 television season The series was created by Ron Greenberg and was based largely on his 1969 production, &quot;The Who, What, or Where Game&quot;. Dick Clark presided over the show with Don Morrow announcing. &quot;The Challengers&quot; was a joint production of Ron Greenberg Productions and Dick Clark Productions, with Buena Vista Television (now Disney–ABC Domestic Television) as distributor.

&quot;The Challengers&quot; premiered on September 3, 1990 and aired new episodes until August 2, 1991. A series of reruns filled out the remainder of its broadcast run, which ended on August 30, 1991. The program was one of five syndicated game shows to premiere in the fall of 1990 and had the longest run of the five due to its production schedule, but like the others it was not renewed for a second season. 

==Gameplay==
Three contestants, one a returning champion, competed on each show.

===Challengers Sprint Round===
The Challengers Sprint was a sixty-second speed round that began each game. Clark would ask a series of rapid-fire questions worth $100, and the contestants tried to be the first to buzz in to answer as only one of them could attempt each question. Answering correctly added $100, while answering incorrectly deducted $100. For the first three weeks of episodes, each contestant started the game with nothing; beginning on September 24, 1990, they were each staked with $200 at the start of the game. If time ran out while Clark was reading a question, he would finish it and allow the contestants a chance to respond.

Once the round ended, the contestant in the lead gained initial control of the board for the first round. In the event of a tie, one more question was asked; the contestant that answered it correctly started the first round, but answering incorrectly gave that privilege to the other contestant. 

This round was briefly removed partway through the run (concurrent with the change to the daily &quot;Ultimate Challenge&quot; format, as described below) in favor of a single toss-up question, with the contestant who answered correctly scoring $100 and control of the Round 1 board. If someone buzzed in and did not answer correctly, he/she lost $100 and a new toss-up was given to the other two contestants. These rules did not last long, and by February 1991, the Challengers Sprint had been reinstated.

===Round 1===
Six categories, each containing three questions, were displayed on a video wall. The contestant in the lead after the Challengers Sprint (or the one who answered the single toss-up correctly when the Sprint was not in use) chose one to begin the round. The contestants were then given clues to the subjects of the three questions, valued at $150, $200, and $250 in order of increasing difficulty (later reduced to $100, $150, and $200). Correct answers added the value of the question to the contestant&#x27;s score, while incorrect answers subtracted the same value.

Each contestant secretly chose one of the three questions using buttons on their podiums, and their choices affected the gameplay as follows:
* &quot;Each contestant chose a different question.&quot; The three questions were asked in increasing order of value, with each contestant answering his/her own question.
* &quot;Two contestants chose one question; the third contestant chose a different one.&quot; The two questions were asked in increasing order of value. The solo contestant had to answer his/her own question, while the two who chose the same question used their buzzers. If the first contestant of the two who chose the same question answered incorrectly, the other could either pass or try to answer.
* &quot;All three contestants chose the same question.&quot; All three question values were immediately doubled, and the chosen question was asked as a toss-up open to all three contestants. The same toss-up rules as above applied. A contestant who answered correctly could either end the category or attempt either of the remaining two questions unopposed. Correctly answering this second question again gave the contestant the option to stop or try the third question. An incorrect answer on either the second or third question subtracted its doubled value from the contestant&#x27;s score and ended the category.

In each case, the category was eliminated from play and the last contestant to give a correct answer chose the next one. Play continued until all six categories were played or time ran out.

===Round 2===
Six new categories were introduced and play continued as described above, with all question values doubled ($300/$400/$500, later $200/$300/$400).

As in Round One, play continued until all six categories were played or time ran out. Any players who finished the round with a zero or negative score were eliminated from the game.

===Final Challenge===
One final category was presented, with three question choices, each of which offered different payout odds of 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 ranked by increasing difficulty. The contestants had 15 seconds to secretly choose a question and decide how much of their score they wanted to wager on it. If multiple contestants chose the same question, only the one who placed the largest wager was allowed to answer it; the others were locked out of the round.

Answering a question correctly won the value of the wager multiplied by the odds, while a miss deducted only the value of the wager. The player in the lead after this round won the game and returned as champion the next day, although all contestants kept what they had earned. Contestants could choose to receive their winnings in cash or have them deposited into a Citibank Visa account that would be opened in their name. Later, they were given the additional option of opening a MasterCard account instead. Champions remained on the show until they were defeated.

If only one contestant finished the second round with a positive total, he/she had the option to skip the Final Challenge. If he/she decided to play it, the contestant was shown the category and the question choices. He/she then selected one and made a wager. Giving an incorrect answer deducted the wager and ended the game. Answering correctly, as before, won the value of the wager times the odds attached, and the contestant was given the choice to stop or continue playing. The round continued until all three questions had been attempted, or if the contestant either gave an incorrect answer or decided to stop.

===Ultimate Challenge===
&quot;The Challengers&quot;, like many game shows, employed a bonus round. The round was referred to as the Ultimate Challenge, and offered a prize of five figures to any champion who managed to beat it.

====Format #1====
The initial Ultimate Challenge format saw the round played for an accumulating cash jackpot. The difference between it and most other game show bonus rounds was that a champion had to qualify to play the round by winning three consecutive matches. When a champion qualified, the round would be played at the start of the next episode, and the first round of the main game would be shortened to accommodate it.

Two categories were presented to the champion at the beginning of the round, and each one had three different question subjects. The champion selected a category and was then shown the question subjects in the order in which they would be asked, and was given five seconds to think before answering each question. Answering all three questions correctly won the Ultimate Challenge and the jackpot, while an incorrect answer at any point ended the round and awarded nothing.

Originally, the jackpot had a starting value of $50,000 and was to increase in value by $5,000 for each time the Ultimate Challenge was played and not won. The series began with the jackpot at $55,000, since the round had been played on a special preview episode prior to its actual premiere and was not won. During the first two weeks of episodes, however, no champion won enough games to play the Ultimate Challenge. Therefore, two changes were made to the format beginning on the September 17, 1990 episode of &quot;The Challengers&quot;. One change took effect immediately, adding $1,000 to the jackpot every day it went unclaimed whether a champion had played for it or not. The other took effect once the jackpot was won, as the starting value was cut to $25,000. 

On September 24, the Ultimate Challenge was completed for $60,000. Between then and November 20, when the original format was retired, the round was played a total of five times and won on four occasions.

====Format #2====
Beginning on November 21, 1990, the Ultimate Challenge was reconfigured as a daily bonus round with $10,000 cash at stake. Initially, as before, the champion was presented with a choice of categories before the round began. Later the choice was dropped and the champion was told the category at the outset of the round.

Instead of needing to answer three questions correctly to win the Ultimate Challenge, the champion only had to answer one. However, the question could and often did contain multiple answers and all parts had to be answered correctly in order for the champion to win the $10,000.

The Ultimate Challenge was eventually done away with; while an exact date has yet to be determined, the round was retired sometime after the February 15, 1991, episode.

==Tournaments==

===Tournament of Champions===
For the first two months that &quot;The Challengers&quot; was on the air, contestants were not only competing to win money but were also trying to earn spots in the show&#x27;s Tournament of Champions. The tournament was conducted the week of November 12, 1990, and its structure was similar to the one employed by &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; during its own tournaments. 

The nine highest winning contestants through November 9, 1990 qualified for the tournament. They then competed, three at a time, over the first three days of the tournament. The winners advanced to the finals, which began on November 15 and were a two-day, cumulative score match. The contestant with the highest total score after those two days would be rewarded with a $25,000 bonus. As in regular play, all participants kept whatever money they had earned.

===Teachers Tournament===
Nine teachers competed, using the same format as the Tournament of Champions and awarding a $10,000 bonus to the overall winner.

===Invitational Tournament===
&quot;The Challengers&quot; invited nine more champions back for a tournament, which was held the week of March 18, 1991 and followed the same structure as the two previous ones. A $10,000 bonus was awarded to the winner as in the Teachers Tournament.

==Questions==
Many questions were related to current events, an aspect that the producers saw as a selling point. Episodes were taped shortly before their airdate, which was prominently displayed in the opening and on a screen behind Clark; generally, a week of episodes were taped on the Friday of the previous week, which allowed such categories as &quot;This Week On TV&quot; and &quot;Today At The Movies&quot; to be used frequently.

Most of the current event questions and answers were taken from, or verified by, &quot;Newsweek&quot;; this was announced on-air at the midpoint of each episode.

The series was also unique in its payout structure: contestants received their winnings on a Citibank Mastercard or Visa credit card, although Dick referenced in some episodes that contestants had the option of converting the balance to cash.

<text>Poamsan is one of the Sobaek Mountains of central South Korea. It rises to above sea level, and stands on the border of Mungyeong City, North Gyeongsang province and Chungju City, North Chungcheong province. To the southwest of its principal peak, Poam mountain descends to the low pass of Haneuljae.

Much of Poam Mountain is now contained in Woraksan National Park. Its lower slopes contain a number of important cultural artifacts, many of which are linked to the role of Haneuljae as a key transit route in the Silla and Goryeo periods. For example, the site of the Goryeo-era Buddhist temple of Mireuksa is located in Mireung-ni, Chungju City. The site of the Silla-era Buddhist temple of in Gwaneum-ni, Mungyeong-eup, Mungyeong City. Stone pagodas and sculptures from these long-abandoned temples, which appear to have played a double role as temples and traveller&#x27;s hostels, can still be found at the sites.

<doc id="1256241" wikidata="Q605761" url="?curid=1256241" title="American Cordillera">
<text>The American Cordillera ( ) is a chain of mountain ranges (cordilleras), consisting of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western &quot;backbone&quot; of the Americas. Aconcagua is the highest peak of the chain. It is also the backbone of the volcanic arc that forms the eastern half of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

==Description==
===North America===

The overlapping and parallel ranges begin in the north with the Alaska Range and the Brooks Range in Alaska, and run through the Yukon into British Columbia. The main belt of the Rocky Mountains along with the parallel Columbia Mountains and Coast Ranges of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and Vancouver Island. In the United States, the Cordillera branches include the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada, the Cascades, and various small Pacific coastal ranges. In Mexico, the Cordillera continues through the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental, as well as the backbone mountains of the Baja California peninsula.

The Cordillera carries on through the mountain ranges of Central America in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, and becomes the Andes Mountains of South America.

===South America and Antarctica===
The Cordillera, having extended through Central America, continues through South America and even to the Antarctic. In South America, the Cordillera is known as the Andes Mountains. The Andes, with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of Chile, extend through Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile to the southernmost tip of South America at Tierra del Fuego. The Cordillera continues along the Scotia Arc before reaching the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula.

<text>The naval battle of Mizushima took place on 17 November 1183 during the Genpei War. One of the most important bases of the Taira was Yashima, a small island off the coast of Shikoku. In November 1183, Minamoto no Yoshinaka sent an army to cross the Inland Sea to Yashima, but they were caught by the Taira just offshore of Mizushima (水島), a small island of Bitchu Province, just off Honshū. The Taira tied their ships together and placed planks across them to form a flat fighting surface.

The battle began with Taira archers loosing a rain of arrows upon the Minamoto boats; when the boats were close enough, daggers and swords were drawn, and the two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Finally, the Taira, who had brought fully equipped horses on their ships, swam to the shore with their steeds, and routed the remaining Minamoto warriors.

<doc id="1256263" wikidata="Q3660813" url="?curid=1256263" title="Queens Boulevard">
<text>Queens Boulevard is a major thoroughfare connecting Midtown Manhattan, via the Queensboro Bridge, to Jamaica in Queens, New York City, United States. It is long and forms part of New York State Route 25.

Queens Boulevard runs northwest to southeast from Queens Plaza at the Queensboro Bridge entrance in Long Island City. It runs through the neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Woodside, Elmhurst, Rego Park, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and Briarwood before terminating at Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica. The boulevard is wide for much of its length, with shorter sections between wide. Its immense width, heavy automobile traffic, and thriving commercial scene has historically made it one of the most dangerous thoroughfares in New York City, with pedestrian crossings up to long at some places.

The route of today&#x27;s Queens Boulevard originally consisted of Hoffman Boulevard and Thompson Avenue, which was created by linking and expanding these already-existing streets, stubs of which still exist. In 1913, a trolley line was constructed from 59th Street in Manhattan east along the new boulevard. During the 1920s and 1930s the boulevard was widened in conjunction with the digging of the IND Queens Boulevard Line subway tunnels. In 1941, the New York City Planning Department proposed converting Queens Boulevard into a freeway, which ultimately never occurred.

==Route description==

Queens Boulevard runs northwest to southeast across a little short of half the length of the borough, starting at Queens Plaza at the Queensboro Bridge entrance in Long Island City and running through the neighborhoods of Sunnyside, Woodside, Elmhurst, Rego Park, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens, and Briarwood before terminating at Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica. At , it is one of the longest roads in Queens, and it runs through some of Queens&#x27; busiest areas. Queens Boulevard is the starting point of a number of other major streets in Queens, such as Northern Boulevard, Woodhaven Boulevard, Junction Boulevard, Roosevelt Avenue, and Main Street.

Queens Boulevard has a width of from Queens Plaza to Van Dam Street, from Van Dam Street to Union Turnpike, from Union Turnpike to Hillside Avenue, and from Hillside Avenue to Jamaica Avenue. Much of the road has 12 lanes, and at its intersection with Yellowstone Boulevard in Forest Hills, it reaches a high point of 16 lanes.

Along much of its length (between Roosevelt Avenue and Union Turnpike), the road includes six express lanes (three in each direction) and a three-lane-wide service road on each side. Drivers must first exit to the service road to make right turns or pull over. Left turns must be made from the express lanes, but only at select cross-streets. The express lanes use a underpass (separated by a median) to bypass Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Expressway; the service roads provide access to both streets.

Due to the high number of crashes, Queens Boulevard is known as the Boulevard of Death. More crashes happen along Queens Boulevard than any other roadway statewide.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The route of today&#x27;s Queens Boulevard originally consisted of Hoffman Boulevard and Thompson Avenue, which was created by linking and expanding these already-existing streets, stubs of which still exist. A remnant of the old Hoffman Boulevard can be found in Forest Hills where the local lanes of traffic diverge into two routes, one straight and one that bends around MacDonald Park. The part that bends around the park was the original route of Hoffman Boulevard. The street was built in the early 20th century to connect the new Queensboro Bridge to central Queens, thereby offering an easy outlet from Manhattan.

In 1913, a trolley line was constructed from 59th Street in Manhattan east along the new boulevard.

=== 1930s–1950s: widening and subway construction ===
During the 1920s and 1930s the boulevard was widened in conjunction with the digging of the IND Queens Boulevard Line subway tunnels. The new subway line used cut-and-cover construction and trenches had to be dug up in the center of the thoroughfare, and to allow pedestrians to pass over the construction, temporary bridges were built. The improvement was between Van Dam Street and Hillside Avenue, and it cost $2.23 million. The street was widened to between Van Dam Street and Union Turnpike, and from there to Hillside Avenue it was widened to . As part of the project, there was to have been separated rights-of-way for the trolley line.

On May 2, 1936, Queens Borough President George U. Harvey cut the ribbon for the opening of the center roadway of the Boulevard at Seminole Avenue in Forest Hills. This widened section allowed drivers to access the Grand Central Parkway. This work was partially funded with aid from the Works Progress Administration. $1,555,000 was initially allotted to this project. On April 17, 1937, trolley service along Queens Boulevard ended, being replaced by bus service.

In the late 1930s, NY 25 was aligned to follow Queens Boulevard (NY 24) from Skillman Avenue to Horace Harding Boulevard, where NY 25 turned eastward to follow Horace Harding Boulevard back to its original alignment at Corona Avenue.

In 1941, the New York City Planning Department proposed converting Queens Boulevard into a freeway, as was done with the Van Wyck Expressway, from the Queensboro Bridge to Hillside Avenue. The boulevard would be converted to an expressway with grade separation at the more important intersections, and by closing off access from minor streets. As part of the project, the express lanes of Queens Boulevard were depressed in the area of Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (later turned into the Long Island Expressway), while the local lanes were kept at grade level. The plan to upgrade the boulevard was delayed with the onset of World War II, and was never completed.

in the early 1940s, New York State Route 25 was altered to follow Queens Boulevard entirely.

On November 18, 1949, the Traffic Commission approved the retiming of traffic signals along the entire Boulevard to speed traffic, which would take effect about February 1, 1950. The change, known as the &quot;triple-offset system&quot; was expected to reduce peak congestion, like what was done on the Grand Concourse. Westbound traffic would be favored from 7 to 9 a.m., while eastbound traffic would be favored from 5 to 7 p.m.. The Boulevard handled 73,000 cars on an average weekday, with a peak of 7,600 cars an hour towards Manhattan, and a peak of 6,700 to points east.

===1960s–1970s===

In 1960, Queens borough president John T. Clancy proposed reconstructing the entire seven-mile boulevard to meet traffic demand from the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair for $17.1 million. Due to bureaucratic issues and the need to finance the project using city funds, the project was delayed and cut back to a 2.5 mile section for $2.6 million. Underpasses at Union Turnpike and at Grand Avenue—Broadway were dropped from the plan. On September 3, 1964, the Department of Highways announced that the project was far behind the project&#x27;s original schedule. Only $2.6 million for the central section of the project was approved as rebuilding more than a mile of the road a time was deemed to be too disruptive for travel. At the time, the rebuilding of the first 1-mile section from 70th Avenue to Union Turnpike was completed. The six service road lanes were resurfaced, yellow asphalt surfacing was installed to guide drivers turning at intersections, and malls were narrowed to widen the roadway and provide space for cars turning off the six-lane main roadway. Work on the 63rd Drive to 70th Avenue section was 70 percent complete, and the Department of Highways expected to request the release of $400,000 for the section to Woodhaven Boulevard within two weeks. Work on that section was expected to start in 1965. Queens Boulevard handled more than 85,000 vehicles a day, making it the second busiest roadway in the city, after the Long Island Expressway, which handled 125,000 vehicles a day.

In 1969, many traffic lights on Queens and Northern Boulevards were computerized, reducing travel time by as much as 25 percent during off-peak hours, and as much as 39 percent during rush hour.

===1980s to 2000s===
In 1985, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) started a project to examine the causes of fatalities and injuries on the boulevard. The changing of traffic signals to increase crossing times across the boulevard helped reduce the average pedestrian deaths in a section in Forest Hills and Rego Park from 4 each year from 1980 and 1984 to 1 in 1986. In four of the five years between 1988 and 1992, as many people were killed in car accidents on the boulevard as on any other street in the city. Between 1991 and 1992, new speed limit signs were installed on the boulevard, police enforcement of traffic light and speeding violations was increased, and the timing for street lights was adjusted.

In 1992, in a test lasting a month, one camera on the boulevard recorded over 1,000 red-light and speeding violations. In 1993, the NYCDOT planned on installing 15 video cameras across the city that spring, with at least one installed on Queens Boulevard, to monitor and report drivers who run red lights or speed. Summonses would be sent to the owner of the car observed making the traffic infractions. The DOT also planned on installing barriers in the center median separating eastbound and westbound traffic in a section of Forest Hills to discourage people from crossing the street outside of intersections. The DOT had studied installing pedestrian bridges over Queens Boulevard, in addition to Eastern Parkway and Grand Concourse, but had found that it would have been too expensive to do so.

In January 1997, the city commissioned a study of the of roadway between the Long Island Expressway and Union Turnpike. The study was completed by 1999, and most work was finished by July 2001. As part of the improvement process, the city installed new curb- and median-extensions along the corridor; repainted crosswalks so they were more visible; added fences in the medians; closed several &quot;slips&quot; that allowed vehicles to make high-speed turns; posted large signs proclaiming that &quot;A Pedestrian Was Killed Crossing Here&quot; at intersections where fatal accidents have occurred; and reduced the speed limit from ; a few segments had 35 mph speed limits. Pedestrian signals were adjusted so that they were given 60 seconds to cross the boulevard, compared to 32–50 seconds before the improvements.

The street gained notoriety in 2001 as &quot;the Boulevard of Death&quot; due to multiple pedestrian fatalities. Due to an aggressive public safety campaign by the NYCDOT and engineering changes, deaths fell from 17 in 1993 and 18 in 1997 to 4 in 2001; nonfatal accidents were reduced from 2,937 in 1993 to 1,627 in 2001. New fences in the median led most pedestrians to use crosswalks. The number of camera on poles to catch drivers running red lights increase from four to two, and the NYCDOT planned to mount dozens of fake cameras to keep drivers guessing in 2002. The NYCDOT had resisted making the speed for the boulevard a uniform 30 mph for some time, arguing that it would reduce traffic flow. The NYPD said that a uniform limit would allow them to issue more speeding tickets.

In January 2001, in response to the street safety crisis on the Boulevard, the NYPD began a crackdown on jaywalking, and issued over 6,000 jaywalking summonses on the street, as of June 2001. In May 2001, the NYCDOT proposed eliminating a traffic lane in each direction between Kneeland Avenue and Union Turnpike to be used for metered parking to make the street safer. The arrangement was initially going to be piloted for eight months. Between 1993 and 2000, there were 72 pedestrian fatalities on the boulevard, with 24 in 1993 and 22 in 1997.

A second phase covering the rest of the boulevard was studied from November 2001 to July 2004, and improvements were finished by late 2006. These improvements decreased pedestrian accidents on the boulevard by 68%, most notably at large and dangerous intersections. In 2004, one pedestrian was killed crossing Queens Boulevard. On April 5, 2004, city officials announced new measures to improve safety on the boulevard. These included additional fences to deter jaywalking, modifications to improve traffic flow and safety, longer crossing times for pedestrians, and the elimination of U-turns and left turns in some locations.

=== 2010s to present: capital improvement ===
On August 18, 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation broke ground on the first phase of a reconstruction of the Kew Gardens Interchange, involved in the project was the renovation of a nearby viaduct carrying Queens Boulevard over the Van Wyck Expressway and the nearby Briarwood subway station (). In 2011, safety enhancements, including pedestrian countdown signals, were added. That year was the first year that no one was killed crossing the street since 1983, the year when detailed fatality records were first kept.

In 2014, the speed limit on Queens Boulevard was reduced further, from 30 mph to . The speed limit decrease was part of de Blasio&#x27;s Vision Zero program, which aimed to decrease pedestrian deaths citywide. From 2014 to 2016, average speeds of eastbound cars on Queens Boulevard declined from , and the speeds of westbound cars declined from .

In 2015, a new initiative was announced to further improve Queens Boulevard at a cost of $100 million. The section between Roosevelt Avenue and 73rd Street received safety improvements, including pedestrian zones and bike lanes, as part of improvement&#x27;s Phase 1, which began in August 2015 and was finished by the end of the year. Phase 2 between 74th Street and Eliot Avenue began in summer 2016. Phase 3 was split into two projects: between Eliot Avenue and Yellowstone Boulevard, and between Yellowstone Boulevard and Union Turnpike. The segment of the Phase 3 overhaul between Eliot and Yellowstone started in May 2017, while the segment between Yellowstone and Union Turnpike would start in July 2018.

The project gained opposition from some of the community boards surrounding Queens Boulevard because parking spots were removed to make way for the bike lanes. Starting in 2019, the whole boulevard was to have been totally overhauled in a manner similar to the Grand Concourse&#x27;s capital reconstruction. Partially as a result of these safety improvements, there were no pedestrian deaths on Queens Boulevard between 2014 and 2017. The first segment to be overhauled, between Roosevelt Avenue and 73rd Street, received federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2023; it is expected to be renovated for $23.75 million between late 2024 and 2027.

==Issues==
===Pedestrian safety===

The combination of Queens Boulevard&#x27;s immense width, heavy automobile traffic, and thriving commercial scene made it the most dangerous thoroughfare in New York City by the 1990s, and has earned it citywide notoriety and morbid nicknames such as &quot;The Boulevard of Death&quot; and &quot;The Boulevard of Broken Bones&quot;. During the period 1950–2000, over 27,000 people were injured on Queens Boulevard. From 2002–04 there were 393 injuries and eight deaths. Queens Boulevard became known as the &quot;Boulevard of Death&quot;. &quot;New York Newsday&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; got into a circulation war on the issue of the &quot;Boulevard of Death&quot;, and the DOT was under pressure to take action. Weinshall implemented pedestrian improvements on Queens Boulevard, including longer pedestrian crossing times, a lowering of the speed limit from 35 mph to 30 mph and the construction of new pedestrian median refuges. The safety improvements have proven successful, without the predicted backups.

Between 1980 and 1984, at least 22 people died and 18 were injured in a stretch of Queens Boulevard in Rego Park and Forest Hills. From 1993 to 2000, 72 pedestrians were killed trying to cross the street, or an average of 10 per year. Eighteen pedestrians were killed while crossing the boulevard just in 1997. Between 1990 and 2017, it was estimated that 186 people, including 138 pedestrians, died in collisions along Queens Boulevard. The street&#x27;s design with straight wide lanes has encouraged drivers to drive as if they were on a highway, leading drivers to travel well above the speed limit. In addition, many people cross the Boulevard in areas without crosswalks since there are long stretches between intersections.

Some of the most dangerous crossings of Queens Boulevard are near Roosevelt Avenue, 51st Avenue, Grand Avenue, Woodhaven Boulevard, Yellowstone Boulevard, 71st Avenue, and Union Turnpike; all of these streets either have high vehicular traffic or cross the boulevard diagonally. Pedestrian crossings of Queens Boulevard can be up to long, or one-and-a-half times the length of a city block in Manhattan. As such, the Boulevard is hard to cross in one traffic light.

== Transportation ==
Queens Boulevard hosts one of the highest numbers of New York City Subway services in the city. It is served by the following subway lines:
* The (IND Queens Boulevard Line) serve the boulevard between Briarwood and Grand Avenue-Newtown, with one extra station at the western end. 
* The (IRT Flushing Line) serve the boulevard between 46th and 33rd Streets. 

Both use stretches of the right of way; only Broadway (nine services), Sixth Avenue (seven) in Manhattan and Fulton Street (eight) in Brooklyn carry more at any one time.

It is also served by the following bus routes: 
* The Q60 bus travels the entire length of Queens Boulevard. 
* The Q32 serves the corridor west of Roosevelt Avenue. 
* The Q59 runs between Grand Avenue and either Horace Harding Expressway (Rego Park) or 62nd Drive (Williamsburg).
* The Q20A, Q20B, and Q44 SBS run between Main Street and Hillside Avenue.
* The runs between Union Turnpike and 78th Avenue, with Kew Gardens buses going out of service at 78th Crescent.
* The Electchester-bound runs from 108th Street to Jewel Avenue, with service originating at 70th Road.
* The Q53 SBS runs between Broadway and either Hoffman Drive (Rockaway Park), or Woodhaven Boulevard (Woodside).
* The Corona-bound runs from 62nd Drive to 63rd Drive.
* The Jackson Heights-bound runs from Woodhaven Boulevard to 90th Street. 
* The uses the boulevard from 63rd Drive to Junction Boulevard to change its destination from Rego Park to LaGuardia Airport.
* The Long Island City-bound runs from 48th Street to 47th Street.
* East of 32nd Place, the following express routes head to destinations in Queens. Manhattan service turns onto Long Island Expressway:
** The go to Union Turnpike. They are joined with the at the LIE.
** The run to Jewel Avenue, or from 69th Road when going to Manhattan. 
** The serve until Van Wyck Expressway. They are joined with the at the LIE. 
** The continues until Hillside Avenue.
* And these routes use the LIE in both directions:
** The run either to Horace Harding Expressway (Forest Hills) or from 62nd Drive (Manhattan). 
** The South Ozone Park-bound takes the exit to Kew Gardens Road. Manhattan service originates at 80th Road.
** The Rego Park-bound run until 63rd Road. Manhattan service uses Hoffman Drive instead.

For a few decades, streetcar service operated along the boulevard, and until 1957 operated along the sides of the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan. For the section where the line ran concurrently with the IRT Flushing Line, the streetcars ran in a median below the viaduct supporting the elevated trains. In the space of the present-day Aviation High School, there was a train yard for the streetcars.

<text>Mark Agner Boecking Strudal (born 29 April 1968) is a Danish football coach and former player who played as a striker.

==Playing career==
Strudal was born in Glostrup. He got his national breakthrough while playing for Næstved IF in the Danish 1st Division championship. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1988, and was named 1988 &quot;Revelation of the Year&quot; as Næstved finished runners-up in the 1st Division. He moved abroad to play professionally for German team Borussia Dortmund in the winter 1988. He played half a season at Dortmund, but had a controversy with manager Horst Köppel. He moved on to play for Grasshopper Club Zürich in Switzerland in the summer 1989, and won three trophies in his two years at the club. When the Grasshoppers squad faced 20% wage cuts, Strudal decided to leave the club in July 1991.

In September 1991, he returned to Denmark to play for Vejle Boldklub in a transfer deal worth more than DKK 4 million. It was later to be known that his contract with Vejle had a clause which secured Vejle approximately DKK 4 million if he ever was to be sold to a club abroad. His stay at Vejle was short, as he suffered injuries and the club was relegated. He underwent a series of loan deals to other Danish teams; first to former club Næstved IF in the fall 1992, then to F.C. Copenhagen in February 1993, and finally to BK Frem in April 1993.

When his Vejle contract ran out in the summer 1993, he moved on to league rivals Brøndby IF on a free transfer in July 1993. Strudal helped Brøndby win the 1994 Danish Cup and he was a part of the Denmark national team which won the 1995 King Fahd Cup. He stayed two years at Brøndby, before he left the club in July 1995. Despite his credentials, the Vejle clause kept him from moving to a foreign club. He joined Næstved IF for a second time, where he suffered a knee injury which kept him out for five months. He tried to move abroad in the summer 1996, but a four-year contract with Greek club Skoda Xanthi was terminated without pay when Strudal was injured in a pre-season game. He underwent recovery, and made a short comeback to football on an amateur basis at Danish a local club in Hagested in August 1997.

==Coaching career==
Strudal had to end his active career at the end of 1996 due to an injury and then trained as a teacher, where he later taught at the seminary. In September 2000, Strudal was hired as a youth coach at Køge Boldklub.

In the summer 2004, Strudal was appointed manager of Danish club FC Zulu. However, in December 2005 it was confirmed, that Strudal in the summer 2006 would join FC Nordsjælland as a U19 manager. Beside that, Strudal was also a part of the first team staff, where he functioned as a forward coach. In December 2009, he went on full-time as a part of the first team staff, and therefore left the U19-manager position.

In the summer 2015, Strudal was appointed assistant coach of Thomas Frank at Brøndby IF. He left the position in May 2017.

In June 2018, Strudal was appointed manager of Danish 1st Division club Lyngby Boldklub. However, less than five months later, Strudal was fired, after 20 games with 23 points.

In February 2022, Strudal joined Danish amateur club Jyllinge FC as their manager.

<text>The siege of Fukuryūji took place in 1183, and was a battle of the Genpei War, the great 12th-century Japanese civil war between the Taira clan and the Minamoto clan. Fukuryūji (福隆寺) was a fortress belonging to Seno Kaneyasu, a Taira partisan. Imai Kanehira led his men across muddy ricefields, under heavy archer fire, to take the fortress. The attackers were victorious, and Kaneyasu was killed.

<text>Robert Bruce Merrifield (July 15, 1921 – May 14, 2006) was an American biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1984 for the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis.

==Early life==
He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on 15 July 1921, the only son of George E. Merrifield and Lorene née Lucas. In 1923 the family moved to California where he attended nine grade schools and two high schools before graduating from Montebello High School in 1939. It was there that he developed an interest both in chemistry and in astronomy.

After two years at Pasadena Junior College he transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the Philip R. Park Research Foundation taking care of an animal colony and assisting with growth experiments on synthetic amino acid diets. One of these was the experiment by Geiger using the law of the minimum that first demonstrated that the essential amino acids must be present &quot;simultaneously&quot; for growth to occur.

He returned to graduate school at the UCLA chemistry department with professor of biochemistry M.S. Dunn to develop microbiological methods for the quantitation of the pyrimidines. The day after graduating on 19 June 1949, he married Elizabeth Furlong and the next day left for New York City and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.

==Career==
At the institute, later Rockefeller University, he worked as an Assistant for Dr. D.W. Woolley on a dinucleotide growth factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth factors that Woolley had discovered earlier. These studies led to the need for peptide synthesis and, eventually, to the idea for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) in 1959. In 1963, he was sole author of a classic paper in the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; in which he reported a method he called &quot;solid phase peptide synthesis&quot;. This article is the fifth most cited paper in the journal&#x27;s history.

In the mid-60s Dr. Merrifield&#x27;s laboratory first synthesized bradykinin, angiotensin, desamino-oxytocin and insulin. In 1969, he and his colleague Bernd Gutte announced the first synthesis of the enzyme ribonuclease A. This work proved the chemical nature of enzymes.
Dr. Merrifield&#x27;s method greatly stimulated progress in biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine, making possible the systematic exploration of the structural basis of the activities of enzymes, hormones and antibodies. The development and applications of the technique continued to occupy his laboratory, where he remained active at the bench until recently. In 1993, Jeffrey I. Seeman published &quot;Life during a Golden Age of Peptide Chemistry&quot;, Merrifield&#x27;s autobiography, in the series &quot;Profiles, Pathways, and Dreams&quot; for the American Chemical Society. He received the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 1998.

The achievement of synthesizing ribonuclease A (with Bernd Gutte) was all the more significant in that it demonstrated that the linear sequence of amino acids joined in peptide bonds determined directly the tertiary structure of a peptide or protein. I.e. that information coded in one dimension can directly determine the three-dimensional structure of a molecule.

SPPS has been expanded to include solid phase synthesis of nucleotides and saccharides.

==Personal life==
After raising their 6 children, James, Nancy, Betsy, Cathy, Laurie and Sally, his wife Elizabeth (Libby), a biologist by training, joined the Merrifield laboratory at Rockefeller University where she worked for over 23 years.

After a long illness R. Bruce Merrifield died on May 14, 2006, at the age of 84 in his home in Cresskill, New Jersey. At the time of his death he was survived by his wife Libby, their 6 children and 16 grandchildren. Libby died on September 13, 2017.

<text>Athletic Club Ajaccien (), commonly referred to as AC Ajaccio, ACA or simply Ajaccio, is a French professional football club based in the city of Ajaccio on the island of Corsica. The club was founded in 1910 and plays in the Ligue 2, the second tier of the French football league system. Ajaccio play their home matches at the Stade Michel Moretti and are rivals with fellow Corsican club Bastia, with whom they contest the Corsica derby (&quot;Derby Corse&quot;).

== History ==
Depending on sources, it is agreed that Ajaccio began playing in 1909–10. Their adopted colors are red and white stripes. Though they used to play in what was previously utilised as a sand dump, they decided to move to another, cleaner, safer stadium upon the insistence of Jean Lluis, father-in-law of club president Louis Baretti. The new stadium that was chosen held 5,000 spectators and was in use until 1969.

AC Ajaccio were elected Corsican champions on eight occasions, in 1920, 1921, 1934, 1939, 1948, 1950, 1955 and 1964, and are one of three big &quot;island&quot; teams, along with Gazélec Ajaccio and Bastia, the competition between the three being kept no secret. Spectators during the 1946 Corsican Cup final, held between A.C.A. and Sporting Bastia, were handed umbrellas to shield themselves from the violence. Upon refusal of a penalty which would have been awarded to ACA, violence erupted between the fans, who used umbrellas both to cause and shield themselves from violence. This final was abandoned and replayed much later.

A.C.A. became a professional team in 1965 thanks to the ambitious efforts of the club&#x27;s leaders. They initially adopted the symbol of the polar bear, but this has since been dropped in favour of a more stylised logo that uses a part of the Corsican flag.

In 1967, the team became the first Corsican club to play in France&#x27;s top division. Prior to the 2022–23 season, they were most recently in Ligue 1 in the 2013–14 season, when they were relegated after finishing in last place, following a spell of three seasons in the top flight; the drop was confirmed with defeat at neighbours Bastia.

In November 2014, Olivier Pantaloni returned for a third spell as manager. His team came third in 2017–18, qualifying for the play-offs, where they beat Le Havre in a semi-final marred by violence on and off the pitch, before losing the final to Toulouse. The club were denied promotion in 2019–20 when the season was curtailed with ten games remaining due to the coronavirus pandemic; Ajaccio were one point off the top two, who were the only ones to go up as the play-offs could not be contested. In the 2021–22 Ligue 2 season, Ajaccio were promoted back to Ligue 1 after finishing second. However, with three games in hand, the club were relegated directly back down.

On 27 June 2024, Ajaccio was administratively relegated to the Championnat National by the Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion (DNCG) due to financial issues. They appealed the decision, and on the 11th of July 2024, they were reinstated in Ligue 2 for the 2024–25 season.

<doc id="1256305" wikidata="Q3568450" url="?curid=1256305" title="William Bourne (mathematician)">
<text>William Bourne (c. 1535–1582) was an English mathematician, innkeeper and former Royal Navy gunner who presented the first design for a navigable submarine and wrote important navigational manuals. He is often called William Bourne of Gravesend.

In 1574, he produced a popular version of the Martín Cortés de Albacar&#x27;s &quot;Arte de Navegar,&quot; entitled &quot;A Regiment for the Sea.&quot; Bourne was critical of some aspects of the original and produced a manual of more practical use to the seaman. He described how to make observations of the sun and stars, using a cross-staff, and how to plot coastal features from the ship by taking bearings using triangulation.

==Life in Gravesend==
Before publishing his submarine design, William Bourne was a jurat in Gravesend, England. His name first appears in the first charter of incorporation of Gravesend from June 5, 1562. His name appears once again as a jurat in the second charter of Gravesend, June 5, 1568. During the time of the second charter, the only records of regulations for trading in Gravesend are written in Bourne&#x27;s handwriting. This would imply that he held an office such as clerk of the market. He also worked as an innkeeper during this time, one of fourteen in the town of Gravesend.

==Submarine Design==

His design, detailed in his book &quot;Inventions or Devises&quot; published in 1578, was one of the first recorded plans for an underwater navigation vehicle. He designed an enclosed craft capable of submerging by decreasing the overall volume (rather than flooding chambers as in modern submarines), and being rowed underwater. Bourne described a ship with a wooden frame covered in waterproofed leather, but the description was a general principle rather than a detailed plan. However, the concept of an underwater rowing boat was eventually put into action by the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel in 1620, and Nathaniel Symons demonstrated a &#x27;sinking boat&#x27; in 1729 using the expanding and contracting volume of the boat to submerge.

The submarine was the subject of a modern-day recreation on season 3 of &quot;The Re-Inventors&quot; TV show, episode &quot;Bourne Submarine&quot;. The recreation had limited functionality before it sank when water pressure ruptured some membranes on a test descent.

==Inventions or Devises==
&quot;Inventions or Devises&quot;, published in 1578, is one of William Bourne&#x27;s more important works. This book gives many guides and instructional tools for sailors, mostly concerning interactions with other ships. The 21st device listed is the earliest known description of a ship&#x27;s log and line, which he attributes to Humprey Cole, an officer of the Tower Mint. The 75th device on the list is a description of a night signal or early semaphore system to be used between people on distant ships who had previously decided on a code consisting of a series of lights and fashion of standing.

The 110th entry is what seems to be a type of telescope. The device was said to have been employed by mathematician and surveyor Leonard Digges and Bourne was asked to investigate it by Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne&#x27;s is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens (Bourne noted in his report that the device worked but had a very narrow field of view, making impractical in military applications). This &quot;backwards&quot; reflecting telescope predates the earliest known working telescope by 30 years but its unwieldy nature seems to have kept it from being developed.

<text>Valsörarna (in Swedish) or Valassaaret (in Finnish) is a small archipelago in Korsholm, Finland, located in the Kvarken region of the Gulf of Bothnia. The islands are the last you see when going by boat or ferry from Vaasa, Finland to Umeå, Sweden. The archipelago is detached from Korsholm&#x27;s main Replot-Björkö archipelago. They are uninhabited and there is no road access. However, they are an important bird sanctuary, frequented by birdwatchers and ornithologists. They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the High Coast of Sweden and the archipelago of Kvarken, for exhibiting the effects of land rise due to post-glacial rebound.

==History==

===The name===
The name Valsörarna is of Swedish origin. It is believed that the name was derived from the stone-clad shores and the moraine which resembles a whale. The Finnish name Valassaaret is believed to have been derived from the Swedish word.

===An old route between Finland and Sweden===
The Valsörarna is the shortest route to the Swedish island Holmsö only away. During winter, the waters of Kvarken are completely iced and it was possible to walk over to the neighbouring country that way. Today, this is not possible because of active ferry traffic and lanes that are kept open by icebreakers for commercial shipping.

This fact was used during the Finnish War by Russian general Barclay de Tolly who used this route in November 1809 when marching over to Umeå. The march to Sweden with about 3700 soldiers was successful but failed on the return trip. The severe cold of the spring and the lack of food took their toll on the men and it is estimated that 400 died from the cold alone. The remains of these soldiers were still present around Valsörarna in the 1900s. In memory of the fallen men, there is now a memorial mound of stones raised on Äbbskär. A saying tells the tale that the inhabitants of Valsörarna grew tired upon always finding skeletons everywhere around the islands and collected them all in one place, which today is the mound of stones.

===The lighthouse is built===

There was a sailmark made out of a tree on the island in the 1850s, but that became inefficient for use in the dangerous waters of Kvarken as traffic increased. The long thought-of lighthouse became reality after five boats ran aground on the same night in 1879. The lighthouse was designed by Henry Lepaute who worked for Gustave Eiffels engineering company and built by the same company in France that manufactured the components for the Eiffel Tower.

The lighthouse was initially intended to be placed on Äbbskär. However, after digging and ground analysis, it was concluded that Äbbskär had no suitable ground for the lighthouse and it was decided that it should be moved to Storskär. The hole that was dug on Äbbskär is still there today with a coast guard station as a neighbour.

For the move over to Storskär, a bridge of stone was built between it and Äbbskär. The road also built in connection to the bridge got the name &quot;Kärleksstigen&quot; (&quot; the love path&quot;). The lighthouse was securely fastened on the mountain on Storskär in 1886, and still stands there today, fire-red, high and with 175 steps inside.

The lighthouse amazed and even scared people with its fire-red color fuelling rumors. The best known rumor was that if you touched the lighthouse, you got seriously burned from it. This rumor was so widespread that it lived long until the 1950s.

In 1963 the lighthouse was first automated and later, in the 1980s, electrified. The lens system was removed in conjunction with the electrification and is now on display in Vaasa Seamuseum.

The lighthouse was closed from the public in 2013. It was found that it was impossible to repair or reconstruct the lighthouse to fulfill modern safety and accessibility standards without substantially modifying the architecture.
==Climate==
Valsörarna has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with strong moderation from the Kvarken.

<text>Wakefield is a village in the town of South Kingstown, Rhode Island, United States, and the commercial center of South Kingstown. Together with the village of Peace Dale, it is treated by the U.S. Census as a component of the census-designated place identified as Wakefield-Peacedale. West Kingston, another South Kingstown village, was the traditional county seat of Washington County. Since 1991, the Washington County Courthouse has been in Wakefield. The Sheriff&#x27;s Office which handles corrections is also in Wakefield.

The Wakefield village center along Main Street (old Boston Post Road) between Belmont Avenue and Columbia Street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as Wakefield Historic District, with boundary increases in 2019 and 2022. The district is significant for being an early commercial and industrial center. The district includes 53 properties over an area of .

==History==
Wakefield was a focus for settlement due to its location on the Saugatucket River and the old Post Road, which was laid out early in the 18th century. Settlement began in the early 18th century with establishment of a small mill on the Saugatucket River. A tavern and stagecoach stop were established in 1745 and a snuff mill was built around 1765. The textile industry began to become an important source of economic activity in 1807 when a carding mill was established on the Saugatucket River. By 1822, the village had about 60 residents and consisted of nine houses, a store, the carding mill, a grist mill, a saw mill, and a blacksmith shop. A Baptist church was built in 1830 and an Episcopal church followed in 1840.

The local textile mill continued to operate and expand through the 19th century, but in the mid-century, as nearby Peace Dale grew as a manufacturing center and factories were established in other water power sites in the area, Wakefield became the commercial center of South Kingstown. It underwent considerable growth in the 1840s, including the development of some major retail stores. A Roman Catholic priest was assigned to Wakefield in 1852 and the first Catholic church was built two years later. Kenyon&#x27;s Department Store was founded in 1856. A carriage manufacturing operation was established in 1874, and in 1876 the Narragansett Pier Railroad started operation, with a station in Wakefield. It is now a bike trail called the William C. O&#x27;Neill Bike Path. In 1877, the South Kingstown Town Hall was built in the village. A bank and several other major businesses arrived in the 1880s. By 1895, Wakefield had a population of 1,543, and had begun to coalesce with the villages of Peace Dale and Rocky Brook, forming a roughly contiguous settlement with a total population of 3,285.

The Wakefield Mill underwent several ownership changes and expansions in the 20th century. In 1903, it was sold to the Wakefield Woolen Company, which installed new looms and carding equipment for producing high-grade woolen fabrics. It sold again in 1922 and four more times between World War II and 1984. Beginning in the 1950s, parts of the mill complex began to be converted to other uses, but as of 1984, much of the complex was still used for textile manufacturing.

Wakefield&#x27;s first hospital was started in a house in 1919, and a new South County Hospital building was built in 1925 on a tract that formerly had been the town farm.

Beginning in the late 1950s, commercial activity in Wakefield migrated away from the central business district to new commercial areas on the periphery of the community. As of 1984, the village was considered the largest shopping area in South County.

==Economy==
Much of Wakefield&#x27;s economy is driven by seasonal tourism, as the main central business district of South Kingstown runs from the Saugatucket River up to Old Tower Hill.

==Arts and culture==
Buildings in Wakefield listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Rhode Island include Wakefield Baptist Church, Nathaniel C. Armstrong House, John H. Armstrong House, Hera Gallery, and Bell Block.

==Education==
Wakefield is part of the South Kingstown School District. Schools in Wakefield include South Kingstown High School, Broad Rock Middle School, Curtis Corner Middle School, and Wakefield Elementary School(which has been closed along with Curtis Corner Middle School.)

==Media==
The &quot;Narragansett Times&quot;, a twice-weekly paper serving Narragansett and South Kingstown, is published in Wakefield.

<text>Christiansted (Danish for &quot;Christian&#x27;s Place&quot;) is the largest town on Saint Croix, one of the main islands of the United States Virgin Islands, a territory of the United States of America. The town is named after King Christian VI of Denmark.

==History==
The town was founded by Captain Frederik Moth after he was made governor of St. Croix in 1733. Departing from St. Thomas, Moth&#x27;s party had cleared a space for Fort Christianswærn by 5 September. In a ceremony next to this fort on 8 January 1734, the French formally handed the island over to the Danes in the form of the Danish West India and Guinea Company. St. Croix was to be allotted 300 plantations, 215 for sugar and the rest for cotton. The plantations surveyed were 3,000 by 2,000 feet. In addition, the company established a sugar refinery and distillery. The fort was completed by 1740. The 1742 census listed 120 sugar plantations, 122 cotton plantations, 1,906 slaves, about 300 Englishmen, and 60 Danes. By 1743, St. Croix had a hospital. In 1745, the number of slaves had increased to 2,878. By 1754, the town included 83 &quot;white inhabitants&quot;, &quot;each of whom owned from a single slave to sixty-six of them&quot;, according to Westergaard. Slaves on the island numbered 7,566.

Christiansted is a former capital of the Danish West Indies and home to the Christiansted National Historic Site. It has preserved the 18th-century Danish-style solid stone buildings in pastel colors with bright red tile roofs line the cobblestone sidewalks, adding a touch of 18th-century European architectural style. Because the town was constructed by African slaves, there are also African influences in Christiansted&#x27;s design, making it one of the world&#x27;s few &quot;African-Danish&quot; towns. The town&#x27;s symmetry, with streets running at right angles to the waterfront, makes it popular for walking tours. The commercial area centers on King and Company streets, adjacent to the Christiansted National Historic Site. The residential area, including portions that were originally settlements for free blacks, extends inland and uphill from the commercial area. The botanist Julius von Rohr started a botanic garden in the 18th century and produced a number of landscapes of the island.

Christiansted has small hotels and many restaurants. In 1947, The Buccaneer resort, to the northeast of town, was opened by the Armstrong family as an 11-room inn. Several scuba shops operate in town, as the wharf has easy access to diving attractions on the island&#x27;s north side. A small point of interest is Protestant Cay, a cay near Christiansted.
==Demographics==

As of 2020, Christiansted had a population of 1,770, while the larger sub-district had a population of 1,866.

The population decreased by almost 30% between 2010 and 2020 due to the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

==Economy==
Seaborne Airlines was formerly headquartered in Christiansted.

==Transportation==
Christiansted is served by one commercial airport, Henry E. Rohlsen Airport, with flights on several airlines, including American and Delta.
A ferry serving the hotel on the Cay resort runs between Christiansted and Protestant Cay.

==Education==
Public schools serving the community are operated by the St. Croix School District.

== Climate ==
Christiansted has a tropical savanna climate (Koppen Aw/As).

<text>The Democratic League of Kosovo (, LDK) is the oldest and one of the largest political parties in Kosovo.

== History ==

During the late 1980s, nationalism was on the rise throughout the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Since 1974 the province of Kosovo, although part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, was a self-governed entity over which the Serbian parliament had almost no factual control (&quot;see Political status of Kosovo&quot;). In the late 1980s, civil unrest which had been striking the province for decades, suddenly erupted further in Kosovo as ethnic Albanians demanded more autonomy (in view of becoming the 7th Yugoslav Republic). At the same time, Serbian Communists&#x27; leader Slobodan Milošević used the situation in Kosovo as a political means to win popularity among Serbs. In 1989, he abolished the autonomy of Kosovo using amendments to the Serbian Constitution, reverting Kosovo to its pre-1974 status, thus restoring Serbia&#x27;s control of the province. In response, a group of Albanian intellectuals gathered the same year to form the Democratic League of Kosovo, which opposed these measures, as well as the ratification of Kosovo&#x27;s parliament in 1990 which returned the level of Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy to how it had been sixteen years earlier.

Because of its ideology, which was deemed nationalist and separatist, it was banned by the Yugoslavian authorities, together with the self-styled shadow Kosovo Parliament that opposed the ratifications of Kosovo&#x27;s real assembly in July 1990. As a result, its members proclaimed in protest on the steps of the parliament building the &quot;Republic of Kosova&quot;, independent from Yugoslavia, which drafted its own constitution. Claiming that conditions for Albanians were not addressed, the LDK successfully called for a boycott of the Kosovar Albanians of the first free elections in 1990. Following the 1991 population census, in which LDK President Rugova also called for boycott, resulting in only 9,091 Albanians recorded which composed around 2.53% of the Kosovar population, the LDK called the Albanian people to leave and boycott all state institutions until the solution of the Albanian national question. The LDK opposed the centralized control imposed by Belgrade, which reintroduced the Serbian language as the language of Kosovo as well as making other implementations; and they were growing deeply concerned about Belgrade&#x27;s handling of the Albanian populace with regards to the wider group interests.

By the spring of 1991, the LDK had support from the diaspora in Zürich, Stuttgart and Brussels and numbered a massive membership of approximately 700,000 people. In September 1991 the LDK-constituted shadow Albanian parliament of the self-styled Republic of Kosova adopted a resolution supporting full-scale &quot;Independence and Sovereignty of Kosovo&quot;. The LDK then led the &quot;Coordinating Committee of Albanian Political Parties in Yugoslavia&quot; that included most ethnic Albanian political parties in the country. The decision was that only two choices are viable for peace and stability of the region:
1) unification of all Albanian-populated areas in Yugoslavia, or
2) an undivided Albanian state of all Albanians in the Balkans

The LDK was one of the chief organizers of a poorly organized referendum for self-determination in 1992, in which 87% of Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian population (numbering 80% of the province&#x27;s population) voted for independence. The referendum was declared illegal and further drove a rift between Albanians and Serbians in Kosovo. In 1992 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed and Kosovo remained an autonomous province of the Republic of Serbia. The LDK successfully called for Albanians, including those in Central Serbia and in the Preševo Valley, to boycott of general elections.

The LDK expressed bitterness when Kosovo was ignored during the Dayton Accords in 1995. Supporting an Albanian resistance movement the &quot;National Movement for the Liberation of Kosovo&quot;, it abandoned its support of the subsequently organized Kosovo Liberation Army, which used violent means to achieve its goals. After 1997, the government of Albania changed, with a first democratic cabinet formed. Most LDK members abandoned the desire to unite Kosovo with Albania at this point. The LDK&#x27;s desire for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo conflict lost support among the population and was replaced by the militarist KLA when war erupted in late 1998 and 1999 between the KLA and the Yugoslavian and Serbian forces. Severe atrocities against the Albanian population in Kosovo met with harsh criticism from the LDK. With recommendations from the United States, the LDK abandoned pursuits for an independent Kosovo and sought negotiations with Belgrade with a goal of achieving a substantial level of autonomy for Kosovo, with Ibrahim Rugova traveling to Belgrade and meeting President Milošević (now federal leader) on this matter. This act was criticized by the Albanian public and further downgraded the LDK&#x27;s popularity. After the NATO bombing campaign in 1999, leading LDK members were present for the signing of the Kumanovo Treaty that adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and formalized the cessation of hostilities in Kosovo. However, despite their support of Resolution 1244, which mandates significant autonomy for Kosovo while recognizing the &quot;sovereignty and territorial integrity&quot; of Yugoslavia, the LDK continually supported the independence of Kosovo. It is suspected that hundreds of supporters of the Democratic League of Kosovo were kidnapped, tortured and some killed in secret prisons of the Kosovo Liberation Army, mainly between 1998 and 2001, because perceived as rivals of the Democratic Party of Kosovo. 
While still the second largest political party in Kosovo, the LDK&#x27;s support has steadily declined since Kosovo&#x27;s first elections (municipal) in 2001. Other political parties, including those linked to the former Kosovo Liberation Army, such as the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), have scored much gains at LDK&#x27;s expense. The party is presided by a president and five vice-presidents.

At the legislative elections held on 24 October 2004 the party won 45.4% of the popular vote and 47 out of 120 seats, seven of which have defected to the Nexhat Daci-led Democratic League of Dardania. One of the founding members, Ibrahim Rugova was the president of the party as the president of Kosovo until his death, on 21 January 2006. At the last legislative elections held on 17 November 2007, the party won only 22.6% and 25 seats but went on to form a Coalition government with Hashim Thaçi&#x27;s Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK). In October 2010, the LDK withdrew from the coalition.

== Ideology ==
The Party initially started out as an Albanian nationalist right-wing movement which campaigned for Kosovan independence. It was then led by Ibrahim Rugova a moderate leader who separated with the Kosovo Liberation Army faction. After the war the party remained under the conservative leadership of Rugova. The party also adopted several pro-European policies as well as moving farther to the centre of the political spectrum. However, after Rugovas&#x27; death the party went through a period of turmoil with several factions vying for control over the party. The more liberal-conservative stance of Fatmir Sejdiu took over, leading to Nexhat Daci and 6 other MAs forming the more conservative Democratic League of Dardania.

After losing seats consistently under Sejdius leadership unrest within the party began to grow and before the Kosovan parliamentary election, 2010 Isa Mustafa emerged as the new leader securing more than two thirds of the votes. Mustafa&#x27;s leadership has seen the party return to the more hardline conservative stance, and some politicians have even come to describe the League as a social conservative party as well.

Critics have said the party has considerably abandoned their traditional, Kosovo-Albanian nationalist policies and policies of their founder Ibrahim Rugova. Since August 2014, it has been attacked by Vetëvendosje on that front.

The Democratic League of Kosovo has been described as centrist, centre-right and right-wing.

== Controversies ==
Former party leader Isa Mustafa had over 70 cases submitted to the prosecutor over alleged abuse of office while serving as Prishtina mayor. These cases were all thrown out from the prosecutors in charge as the former mayor had no ties with the cases submitted. Former Minister of Culture Astrit Haraqia has been accused of abusing office during 2004–2007 as well as being involved in a large scheme to sell Schengen visas with other party official Ukë Rugova. Suspected of corruption is also current MP Naser Osmani for alleged wrongdoings while in the board of Kosovo Privatisation Agency. He ran and gained a seat in the Assembly despite the accusations. Former Obiliq municipality mayor Mehmet Krasniqi is being investigated for abuse of office. Mehmet Krasniqi has since been found not guilty on the charges.

Former MP of the Democratic League of Kosovo Uke Rugova, the son of the late President Ibrahim Rugova, was accused for alleged involvement in a visa scam by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo. Kosovo’s Special Prosecution had filed an indictment against Uke Rugova and a number of other individuals linked with the Democratic League of Kosovo over an alleged scam concerning Italian visas. Police from the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo first arrested him in February 2014 when he was a member of the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo, according to the charges, Uke Rugova led a criminal group that falsified travel documents for Kosovo nationals.

In October 2020, the Hoti government drafted the Recovery plan which provided assistance to businesses. In the list made by the Minister of Finance, Labor and Transfers of Kosovo Hekuran Murati a total of 50 businesses had benefited 60 million euros from the recovery package drafted by the Hoti Government. The Recovery plan fueled big businesses in Kosovo instead of small ones, &quot;Viva Fresh&quot; had been given over 860 thousand euros, &quot;Elkos&quot; of Ramiz Kelmendi with over 675 thousand euros, &quot;Proex&quot; with over 335 thousand euros, &quot;HIB Petrol&quot; with over 307 thousand euros. In the Recovery plan also benefited the security company &quot;Balkan International SHPK&quot; which is owned by Besnik Berisha, a former advisor to Isa Mustafa when he was Prime Minister of Kosovo, his company received over 100 thousand euros.

<doc id="1256326" wikidata="Q61890" url="?curid=1256326" title="Marbach am Neckar">
<text>Marbach am Neckar is a town about 20 kilometres north of Stuttgart. It belongs to the district of Ludwigsburg, the Stuttgart region and the European metropolitan region of Stuttgart. Marbach is known as the birthplace of Friedrich Schiller, to whom it owes the additional designation of &quot;Schiller City&quot;, which it has officially held since 2022.[2] The town is home to the Schiller National Museum, the German Literature Archive and the Modern Literature Museum.

== Geography ==

===Geographical location===

Marbach is located in the Neckar Basin on the eastern bank of a loop of the Neckar, whose impact slope is interrupted by two deep cuts. The northern of the two cuts is flowed through by the largely blocked Strenzelbach stream, the southern by the Eichgraben ditch. Marbach&#x27;s old town lies on the southern slope of the Strenzelbach valley, some 30 metres above the Neckar, while the newer residential and commercial areas are spread across the slopes further to the north-east, east and south. Even further south, somewhat secluded by the cutting of the Eichgraben, is the residential area of Hörnle with about 1600 inhabitants. The furrow formed by the Strenzelbach cuts short a loop of the Murr, which flows into the Neckar just north of the town, and forms an important traffic axis for Marbach and the surrounding area.

===Districts and exclaves===

In addition to the immediate surroundings of the Inner City, the urban area includes a narrow strip extending southwest along the Neckar River and incorporating the Marbach power plant.

Furthermore, three exclaves belong to the urban area. Two of them are the districts of Rielingshausen and Siegelhausen, both of which are spatially separated from Marbach. While the area of the core town itself is almost free of forest, the largest part of the forest area of Marbach comprises the uninhabited exclave in the Hardtwald to the north-east of the district of Rielingshausen, which is assigned to the Schwäbisch-Fränkische Waldberge natural area.

Rielingshausen, with about 2800 inhabitants, is located about five kilometres northeast of Marbach on a hill between the Murr and the Hardtwald. The hamlet of Hinterbirkenhof, one and a half kilometres to the north, also belongs to the village. The district is divided by several stream valleys, all of which lead to the Murr. The village centre lies in the shallow hollow of the Weidenbach, while the Kaisersbach forms a depression between Rielingshausen and Hinterbirkenhof. The eastern boundary of the village is formed by the Eichbach, which disappears halfway through in a sinkhole. The Sulzbach flows through a wide valley southeast of the village. After being straightened during the land consolidation in the 1970s, it was renaturalised at the end of the 1980s. This measure was awarded the cultural landscape prize of the Swabian Heritage Society in 1991.

Siegelhausen, a small hamlet with about 30 inhabitants, is located about five kilometres southeast of the core town off the road between Affalterbach and Hochdorf in the valley of the Strombach, which is also called the Apfelbach.

==History==
Marbach am Neckar was founded by the Franks in the 8th century AD between the Duchies of Swabia and Franconia and the Prince-Bishoprics of Speyer and Constance. Marbach received its town rights in 1009 from Walter Marktrecht, Bishop of Speyer. Around the mid-13th century, those rights were reaffirmed by the Dukes of Teck. In 1302, the Dukes of Teck sold Marbach to the County of Württemberg, who made the city the seat of its own administrative district later in the 14th century and then an Oberamt, , in 1758. That Oberamt was dramatically enlarged on 18 March 1806, but then dissolved entirely in 1938. Marbach was subsequently assigned to a new district, Landkreis Ludwigsburg. On 1 July 1972, Marbach incorporated the town of Rielingshausen.

==Geography==
The city (&quot;Stadt&quot;) of Marbach am Neckar covers of the district of Ludwigsburg in a total of four separate exclaves. Marbach is, according to government urban planning, part of the Stuttgart Metropolitan Region. Marbach&#x27;s municipal areas are physically located in the Neckar, with the exception of its easternmost exclave, which lies in the Swabian-Franconian Forest. The lowest elevation above sea level in the municipal area, Normalnull (NN), is found where the Neckar flows out of Marbach and into Benningen am Neckar. The highest elevation, , is found in the east, at the top of the Bülzberg.

==Politics==
Marbach has two boroughs (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;) – Marbach am Neckar and Rielingshausen – and three villages: Hinterbirkenhof, Hörnle, Siegelhausen. Also in Marbach&#x27;s municipal area are the minor administrative units of Dampfkraftwerk, Eichgraben, and Häldenmühle, and the abandoned villages of Hegnachsiedel, Kaisersberg, and Sigebotesbuch.

===Sister cities===
Marbach am Neckar is twinned with:

* L&#x27;Isle-Adam, Val-d&#x27;Oise, France, since 1987
* Washington, Missouri, United States, since 1990
* Tongling, Anhui, People&#x27;s Republic of China, since 2005

===Coat of arms===
Marbach am Neckar&#x27;s coat of arms displays its field, gold in color, as divided &quot;party per pale&quot; into halves. The left half has three black , taken from the arms of Württemberg. The right half has a crenelated, white tower wrapped with green vines growing two clusters of blue grapes. The placement of Württemberg&#x27;s arms is derived from town seals in since Württemberg&#x27;s purchase of the city in 1302, when their arms replaced those of the Dukes of Teck. The tower first appeared around 1547 as a reference to local viticulture. The current coat of arms was devised in 1938 from a 1593 town seal. Marbach has had a municipal flag since 1871.

<text>Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior – caesar (MPINB; ) in Bonn is a non-university research institute of the Max Planck Society. It was founded on 1 January 2022. The institute had been associated with the Max Planck Society since 2006, known as the Center of Advanced European Studies and Research (caesar) and has had its focus on neurosciences since this time.

The MPINB focuses on basic research in neuroethology. The international team of researchers studies the link between brain activity and animal behavior. In cooperation with the local university and research organizations, the MPINB trains the next generation of neuroethologists.

== Research ==
The team of researchers at the MPINB is interdisciplinary and brings together unique expertise: biologists, physicists, computer scientists, veterinarians and psychologists work together to unravel the causal link between neural activity and complex natural behaviors. This effort combines expertise in behavioral quantification and analysis, cellular resolution functional imaging in freely behaving animals and Electron Microscopy (EM) -level connectomic analysis of neuronal circuits. The research questions drive the development of new technology, both in experimental instrumentation as well as in computational modeling and data analysis methods. In addition to the technological breadth of the research groups and departments at MPINB, the neuroethological questions are comparative in nature and incorporate a diverse set of species allowing to study a wide repertoire of behaviors across the animal kingdom.

=== Departments and Research Groups ===
The MPINB is home to two departments and seven independent research groups (as of March 2024).

==== Departments ====
* Computational Neuroethology (Director: Kevin Briggman). The aim of the Department of Computational Neuroethology (CNE), headed by Dr. Kevin Briggman, is to develop computational models which can predict goal-directed animal behaviors. 
* Behavior and Brain Organization (Director: Jason Kerr). The primary aim of the Department of Behavior and Brain Organization, headed by Prof. Jason Kerr, is to understand how mammals use vision to make decisions and what the underlying neural processes are. 

==== Research Groups ====
* Cellular Computation and Learning (Aneta Koseska). The lab focuses on identifying basic dynamical principles of biochemical computations and single-cell learning.
* Neurobiology of Magnetoreception (Pascal Malkemper). The lab studies the neurobiological basis of magnetic orientation in mammals
* In Silico Brain Sciences (Marcel Oberlaender). The lab reconstructs neural networks and elucidate mechanistic principles of how the brain integrates sensory information)
* Neurobiology of Flight control (Bettina Schnell). The lab studies how the brain of Drosophila melanogaster controls flight.
* Neural Information Flow (Monika Scholz). The lab uses the foraging behavior of the roundworm C. elegans to research general principles of signal compression, attention and context-dependency in neural systems.
* Neural Circuits (Johannes Seelig): The lab focuses on adaptive neural circuits underlying sensorimotor integration.
* Genetics of Behavior (James Lightfoot). The lab investigates the fundamental principles and molecular mechanisms behind kin-recognition and its associated social behaviors.

More and up-to-date information on the departments and independent research groups can be found on the institute’s website.

== History - The Center of Advanced European Studies and Research ==
The Center of Advanced European Study and Research (caesar) was founded in 1995 as part of the compensatory actions under the Berlin/Bonn law, which were intended to support structural change in the region of the former capital. In 2022, the institute became a full member of the Max Planck Society and is now called Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology of Behavior – caesar.

Until 2021, the independent foundation operated under private law with foundation capital from the governments of Germany and the State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Caesar was closely associated with the Max Planck Society (MPG). The President of the Max Planck Society chaired the board of trustees. The caesar-directors have been scientific members of the Max Planck Society. The appointment of the directors, the evaluations and the safeguarding of scientific excellence were realized according to the criteria of the Max Planck Society.

The foundation operated a research center, which did research in the field of neurosciences with modern photonic, molecular biological and chemical methods as well as methods of microtechnology. Here, particularly optical methods have been utilized for brain research and brain control. Over the years, the focus was more and more on neuroethology and on the question how brains control behavior.

Within the main building there used to be the &quot;Life Science Inkubator&quot; (LSI). The LSI was a public–private partnership (PPP), one partner being caesar. Other partners were e.g. Fraunhofer Society and Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.

<doc id="1256332" wikidata="Q2411417" url="?curid=1256332" title="The Fleetwoods">
<text>The Fleetwoods were an American vocal group from Olympia, Washington, whose members were Gary Troxel (born November 28, 1939), Gretchen Christopher (born February 29, 1940), and Barbara Ellis (born February 20, 1940).

==Early history==
The band members met as high school students in Olympia, Washington. Originally the band consisted of only Gretchen Christopher and Barbara Ellis, but Gary Troxel was asked to accompany them with jazz trumpet, later switching to vocals. They then started performing in 1958 as &quot;Two Girls and a Guy&quot; but later changed the name to the Fleetwoods after the Fleetwood telephone exchange.

In 1959, they were noticed by producer and Dolton Records founder Bob Reisdorff, and together they recorded their self-written first hit, &quot;Come Softly to Me,&quot; which shot to #1 in &quot;Billboard&quot; and was also covered by others. The UK&#x27;s Frankie Vaughan and the Kaye Sisters had a top 10 chart hit in the United Kingdom with the song, though the Fleetwoods exceeded them, simultaneously charting in the UK&#x27;s top 5. Their second hit, &quot;Graduation&#x27;s Here,&quot; was co-written by Ellis and Christopher, with Troxel later adding a scat line in counterpoint. That one was followed by &quot;Mr. Blue,&quot; which, like &quot;Come Softly To Me&quot;, also topped the US pop chart.

The Fleetwoods continued recording into the 1960s. They hit the Top 10 again with a cover of Thomas Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy&quot; in 1961. Though they went on to have a total of eleven hits on the Hot 100, the beginning of the end for the group came when Troxel had to fulfill his obligation to go onto active duty in the United States Navy, as he had joined the Naval Reserve in 1956. Additionally, the British Invasion of the mid 1960s changed the public&#x27;s taste. The trio&#x27;s hits ended in 1963 with Barbara Ellis singing lead on &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot;. Vic Dana, who was to go on to a successful solo career, replaced Troxel in the group when he was in the service, solely for live performances.

==Later years==
In the late 1970s, Troxel was working in a plywood plant in Washington, Ellis was managing a trailer park in California and Christopher was a housewife and modern jazz dance teacher in Washington at St. Martin&#x27;s College and at Evergreen State College. Ellis is now retired from performing. In 1983, Troxel gave his written resignation from The Fleetwoods, leaving Christopher as manager with the sole authority to contract for both the original and replacement Fleetwoods. Troxel formed a new Fleetwoods group in the 1980s. His group has been performing regularly since the mid 1980s doing several &quot;oldies&quot; concerts each year with two performances on the PBS &quot;Doo Wop, Pop and Soul Generations (My Music)&quot; series.

While Christopher trained replacement Fleetwoods, she also resumed her solo music career, billing herself as &quot;Gretchen Christopher of the Fleetwoods.&quot; Both Troxel and Christopher each continue to perform and occasionally release new recordings. A new Fleetwoods version of &quot;Graduation&#x27;s Here&quot; appeared on Christopher&#x27;s autobiographical solo album, &quot;Gretchen&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen (Suite 16)&quot;, which is one of the 2007 &quot;Billboard&quot; critics&#x27; picks for 10 Best Albums of the Year. It included both the hit arrangement of &quot;Come Softly To Me&quot; and an a cappella version, with Christopher singing all the parts.

Since their 1988 induction into the Northwest Area Music Association Hall of Fame and their 2005 induction into the Olympia High School Alumni Association Hall of Fame, The Fleetwoods have been inducted into both the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame of America in 2006.

The November 2007 release of &quot;Gretchen&#x27;s Sweet Sixteen (Suite 16)&quot; was launched in Las Vegas with the second Annual Cool Bobby B Doo Wop Convention and Grand Finale Concert, headlined by &#x27;The Fleetwoods starring Gretchen Christopher.&#x27; A year later, though, all three originals were inducted and invited to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Christopher was the only original member of the Fleetwoods who accepted, attended and performed, dedicating songs to each of her absent partners. Troxel had every intention of attending but decided it was more important to be with his wife, because of her breast cancer treatment.

In 2000, Troxel and his wife Jenifer lost &quot;Troxel v. Granville&quot;, a landmark grandparents&#x27; rights case before the Supreme Court of the United States. The court held that under the United States Constitution, non-parents seeking custody or visitation rights of a child against the wishes of the child&#x27;s parents must prove that the parents are not acting in the best interest of the child in refusing custody or visitation.

In 2008 and 2009, Christopher testified before the Washington State Senate in support of the Truth in Music Advertising Bill, which, in 2009, passed both the Washington State House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Chris Gregoire. The law provides that a performing group shall not be advertised by the name of a recording group, unless the performing group includes from the hit-making recording group at least one original member who is authorized to use the name. The authorization resides solely with Christopher, according to the performance contract and resignation signed by Troxel.

To date, The Fleetwoods are the earliest vocal group to have a #1 single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with all members still living.

<text>The Queen of Spades or Pique Dame, Op. 68 (, &quot;Pikovaya dama&quot; , ) is an opera in three acts (seven scenes) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to a Russian libretto by the composer&#x27;s brother Modest Tchaikovsky, based on the 1834 novella of the same name by Alexander Pushkin, but with a dramatically altered plot. The premiere took place in 1890 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

==Composition history==
The Imperial Theatre offered Tchaikovsky a commission to write an opera based on the plot sketch by Ivan Vsevolozhsky in 1887/88. After first turning it down, Tchaikovsky accepted it in 1889. Toward the end of that year, he met the theatre&#x27;s managers to discuss the material and sketch out some of the scenes.

He completed the full score in Florence in only 44 days. Later, working with the tenor who was to perform the lead character, he created two versions of Herman&#x27;s aria in the seventh scene, using different keys. The changes can be found in the proof sheets and inserts for the first and second editions of the printed version of the score. While composing the music, Tchaikovsky edited the libretto significantly, changing some of the text and adding his own lyrics to two arias.

==Performance history==
Herman, the lead character, sings in all seven scenes. This requires great skill and endurance by the performer. The part was written with the notable Russian tenor Nikolay Figner in mind, and he performed it at the premiere. His wife Medea Mei-Figner played the role of Liza.

The composer himself took part in the preparation of the Saint Petersburg premiere. Critics gave rave reviews. Tchaikovsky later wrote, &quot;Figner and the Saint Petersburg orchestra... have made true miracles.&quot; The premiere&#x27;s success was tremendous. The opera was just as successful at the Kyiv premiere twelve days later. The Bolshoi Theatre premiere took place the following year. Tchaikovsky was extremely pleased with his effort.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Time&quot;: The close of the 18th century

&quot;Place&quot;: Saint Petersburg, Russia

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1&quot;

During the reign of Catherine the Great (1762–96), children are at play in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s Summer Garden pretending to be soldiers. Two officers—Surin and Chekalinsky—enter, the former complaining about his bad luck at gambling. They remark that another officer, Herman, seems obsessed with the gaming table but never bets, being frugal and methodical. Herman appears with Tomsky, who remarks that his friend hardly seems like his old self: is anything bothering him? Herman admits he is in love with a girl above his station whose name he does not even know. When Prince Yeletsky, an officer, strolls into the park, Chekalinsky congratulates him on his recent engagement. Yeletsky declares his happiness while Herman, aside, curses him enviously. Yeletsky points out his fiancée, Lisa, who has just appeared with her grandmother, the old Countess. Catching sight of Herman, the two women note they have seen him before, staring at them with frightening intensity. Herman realizes that Lisa is his unknown beloved. When Yeletsky and the women leave, Herman is lost in thought as the other officers discuss the Countess: known as the Queen of Spades and formerly as the Muscovite Venus, due to her beauty, she succeeded at gambling in her youth by trading amorous favors for the winning formula of Count St. Germain in Paris. Tomsky says only two men, her husband and, later on, her young lover, ever learned the secret of playing three special cards, because she was warned by an apparition to beware a &quot;third suitor&quot; who would kill her trying to force it from her. Musing on the winning sequence of three cards, the others lightly suggest that this might be the way for Herman to win without risking any money. Threatened by approaching thunder, all leave except Herman, who vows to learn the Countess&#x27;s secret.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

At home, Lisa plays the spinet as she and her friend Polina sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their friends ask to hear more, so Polina launches into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Lisa remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Polina, the last to go, urges Lisa to cheer up; Lisa replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Lisa voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look of the young man in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Lisa hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Lisa asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1&quot;

Not long afterward, at a masked ball, Herman&#x27;s comrades comment on his obsession with the secret of the winning cards. Yeletsky passes with Lisa, noting her sadness and reassuring her of his love (&quot;Ya vas lyublyu&quot; &quot;I love you&quot;). Herman receives a note from Lisa, asking him to meet her later. Surin and Chekalinsky sneak up behind him with the intent of playing a joke on him, muttering he is the &quot;third suitor&quot; who will learn the Countess&#x27;s secret, then melt into the crowd as Herman wonders whether he is hearing things. The master of ceremonies announces a tableau of shepherdesses. Lisa slips Herman the key to her grandmother&#x27;s room, saying the old woman will not be there the next day, but Herman insists on coming that very night. Thinking fate is handing him the Countess&#x27;s secret, he leaves. The guests&#x27; attention turns to the imminent arrival of Catherine the Great, for which a polonaise by Osip Kozlovsky is played and sung in greeting.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

Herman slips into the Countess&#x27;s room and looks in fascination at her portrait as the &quot;Muscovite Venus&quot;; musing how their fates, he feels, are linked: one of them will die because of the other. He lingers too long before he can go to Lisa&#x27;s room and hears the Countess&#x27;s retinue coming, so he conceals himself as the old lady approaches. The Countess deplores the manners of the day and reminisces about the better times of her youth, when she sang in Versailles &quot;&quot;Je crains de lui parler la nuit&quot; (&quot;I fear to talk with him at night&quot;, in French; Laurette&#x27;s Aria from André Grétry&#x27;s opera &quot;Richard Cœur-de-Lion&quot;) before the Pompadour herself. As she dozes off, Herman stands before her. She awakens in horror as he pleads with her to tell him her secret. When she remains speechless, he grows desperate and threatens her with a pistol—at which she dies of fright. Lisa rushes in, only to learn that the lover to whom she gave her heart was more interested in the Countess&#x27;s secret. She orders him out and falls sobbing.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1&quot;

In his room at the barracks, as the winter wind howls, Herman reads a letter from Lisa, who wants him to meet her at midnight by the river bank. He imagines he hears the chorus chanting at the old Countess&#x27;s funeral, then is startled by a knock at the window. The old woman&#x27;s ghost appears, announcing that against her will she must tell him the secret so that he can marry and save Lisa. Dazed, Herman repeats the three cards she tells him—three, seven, ace.

&quot;Scene 2&quot;

By the Winter Canal, Lisa waits for Herman: it is already near midnight, and though she clings to a forlorn hope that he still loves her, she sees her youth and happiness swallowed in darkness. At last he appears, but after uttering words of reassurance, he starts to babble wildly about the Countess and her secret. No longer even recognizing Lisa, he rushes away. Realizing that all is lost, she commits suicide.

&quot;Scene 3&quot;

At a gambling house, Herman&#x27;s fellow officers are finishing supper and getting ready to play faro. Yeletsky, who has not gambled before, joins the group because his engagement has been broken: &quot;unlucky in love, lucky at cards&quot;. Tomsky entertains the others with a song. Then Chekalinsky leads a traditional gamblers&#x27; song. Settling down to play, they are surprised when Herman arrives, wild and distracted. Yeletsky senses a confrontation and asks Tomsky to be his second if a duel should result. Herman, intent only on betting, starts with a huge bet of 40,000 rubles. He bets the three and wins, upsetting the others with his maniacal expression. Next he bets the seven and wins again. At this he takes a wine glass and declares that life is but a game. Yeletsky accepts his challenge to bet on the next round. Herman bets everything he has on the ace but when he shows his card he is told he is holding the queen of spades. Seeing the Countess&#x27;s ghost laughing at her vengeance, Herman takes his own life and asks Yeletsky&#x27;s and Lisa&#x27;s forgiveness. The others pray for his tormented soul.

<text>Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma (Malayalam: ) was the founding monarch of the southern Indian Kingdom of Travancore (previously Venadu) from 1729 until his death in 1758. He was succeeded by Rama Varma (&quot;Dharma Raja&quot;) (1758–98).

Marthanda Varma defeated the Dutch East India Company forces at the Battle of Colachel in 1741. He also put an end to the ettuveetil pillamars and the ettara yogam council and took the full power as a king. The Yogakars and Pillamars were always against the Royal Family of Venad (Padmabhaswamy Temple Judgement page :16) He then adopted a European mode of discipline for his army and expanded his kingdom northward (to what became the modern state of Travancore). He built a sizeable standing army of about 50,000 nair men, as part of designing an &quot;elaborate and well-organised&quot; war machine, with the role of the travancore army and fortified the northern boundary of his kingdom (Travancore Lines). His alliance in 1757 with the ruler of Kochi (Cochin), against the northern Kingdom of Calicut, enabled the kingdom of Kochi to survive.

Travancore under Marthanda Varma made a deliberate attempt to consolidate its power by the use of Indian Ocean trade. It was the policy of Marthanda Varma to offer assistance to Syrian Christian traders (as a means of limiting European involvement in ocean trade). The principal merchandise was black pepper, but other goods also came to be defined as royal monopoly items (requiring a license for trade) between the 1740s and the 1780s. Eventually, Travancore challenged and broke the Dutch blockade of the Kerala coast.

Thiruvananthapuram became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. He undertook many irrigational works, built roads and canals for communication and gave active encouragement to foreign trade. In January, 1750, Marthanda Varma decided to &quot;donate&quot; his kingdom to the last Tiruvadi Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu) and thereafter rule as the deity&#x27;s &quot;vice-regent&quot; (Sri Padmanabha Dasa). Marthanda Varma&#x27;s policies were continued in large measure by his successor, Rama Varma (&quot;Dharma Raja&quot;).

== Early life ==

Marthanda Varma was born in 1706 to queen Karthika Thirunal Umadevi, the Queen of Attingal, and Raghava Varma of Kilimanoor Palace. Queen Karthika Thirunal Uma Devi - an adoptee from the northern Kolathunadu ruling family - was the senior queen of Attingal at the time. His father Raghava Varma Koil Thampuran died of severe fever when he was one year old.

At the time of Varma&#x27;s birth, Trippappur Swaroopam (Thiruvithamkoor or Travancore) was a small chiefdom extending from Edava in the north to Aralvaimozhi in the south. The fundamental politico-economic structure of medieval Kerala was going through a crisis.

The power of the king of Venad was very weak and he could not sustain his control over his territory. The old political structure of the medieval Kerala was going through a crisis in the beginning of the 18th century.

* Decentralized state (complex feudal and political relations). Influence of the local land lords (the Ettuveetil Pillamar) and the barons (landlords known as Madampimar). The authority of the throne was also curbed by the Council of Eight and a Half (the Yogakkar), the managing committee of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. There was no standing army.
* European monopoly in Indian Ocean spice trade. The constant Dutch blockade of the Malabar Coast. Trade with the Europeans was an important source for augmenting the financial reserves of the Kerala kingdoms.
*Quarrels and open warfare among the various royal lineages (increased the dependence of the royals on their warriors and collectors of dues). Trade rivalries between the Dutch and English companies had a role in intensifying the conflict among the branches.

An English East India Company factory was established at Vizhinjam in 1644. The Ajengo Fort was established in 1695. The ruler Rama Varma (1721/22 - 1729) entered into treaties with the English East India Company (1723) and the Madurai Nayaks with the aim of strengthening his position (in the fight against the nobles and other hostile elements in Tranvancore). The role played by Marthanda Varma in these moves are highlighted by P. Shungoonny Menon, the 19th-century Travancore court historian. The Dutch Company positioned themselves against the emerging Travancore by helping Quilon and Kayamkulam. The English Company became an ally of Travancore against the Dutch.

== Rule of Marthanda Varma ==
Marthanda Varma ascended the throne when the crisis in Travancore had already deepened. King Rama Varma was forced to invite troops from Tamil Nadu to collect dues and impose order. Even the Padmanabha Swamy Temple affairs were heading towards a crisis due to lack of funds. The Thampi brothers, sons of Rama Varma, immediately revolted against Marthanda Varma (who was the legitimate successor on the basis of the Nair matrilineal system) with the assistance of a Tamil army.

Marthanda Varma&#x27;s reign was one of constant warfare, against opponents both inside and outside his territory. After reducing the power of the Ettuveetil Pillamar, the Nair aristocracy, and their associates, the Yogakkars, Marthanda Varma turned his attention to central Kerala. He realised that Dutch power in Kerala stemmed from their flourishing spice trade at the port of Kochi. He set out to conquer the major spice-producing areas supplying cargo to Kochi. After declaring a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, between then and 1752, the king annexed Quilon, Kayamkulam, Thekkumkur, Vadakkumkur and Purakkad to Travancore (thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch).

* In 1731, the port of Kollam (Quilon) - which was ruled by a branch of the Venadu family to which Marthanda Varma also belonged - was defeated and its last chief was made to sign a treaty allowing the annexation of his chiefdom by Travancore after his death. The chief was brought to Thiruvananthapuram and lodged almost as a state prisoner in the Valikoikkal Palace. A contingent of the Travancore army under Dalavay Arumukham Pillai was stationed at Kollam.
* Marthanda Varma next turned his attention towards the little chiefdom of Marta and seized it. The neighbouring chiefdom of Kayamkulam - sensing an imminent invasion by Travancore - soon allied itself with Kochi, Purakkad and Vadakkumkur. The Kayamkulam chief was also successful in rescuing the Kollam chief from his Thiruvananthapuram prison. The allies built new fortifications and strengthened their defences against the threat of Travancore. The Dutch East India Company also professed to support the war effort.
* The subsequent invasion of Marta by the Kayamkulam chief signalled the outbreak of the war. The Travancore army seized Nedumangadu and Kottarakkara and prevented the joined forces of Elayadathu and Kayamkulam. Travancore Dalavay Ramayyan then lead an expeditionary force to capture the city of Kollam. But, he was forced to withdraw without accomplishing his mission.
* Having equipped their forces with the help of the French and the English Companies, Travancore renewed a military operation against the chief of Kollam. In the campaigns that ensued, the ruler of Kayamkulam was killed (1734). But the defence of Kollam continued under the leadership of the brother of the deceased chief and Travancore forces were forced to fall back once again.
* Travancore&#x27;s next campaign was against Elayadathu Swaroopam (Kottarakara). When the chief of Kottarakara who was kept in solitary confinement in Thiruvananthapuram died in 1739, Marthanda Varma refused to recognise the claim of the senior female member to succession. The princess fled to Thekkumkur where the chief gave granted her asylum. At this juncture, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff sensed an opportunity to involve further in the politics of Kerala.
* In 1739, van Imhoff arrived in Kochi, took up the cause of the female ruler of Kottarakara and protested against the annexation of that chiefdom by Marthanda Varma in a meeting between the two. In 1741, the Dutch reinstated the female ruler of Kottarakara against the wishes of Marthanda Varma, who attacked the chiefdom and defeated the combined Kottarakkara - Dutch forces before finally fully annexing the chiefdom to Travancore while the female ruler fled to Kochi.

===Battle of Colachel (1741)===

Travancore then launched a series of raids on the Dutch forts in the area and captured them all. In retaliation, a Dutch artillery force landed at Colachel from Ceylon and conquered up to Kottar. The Dutch forces then advanced against Kalkulam, Travancore&#x27;s capital. Marthanda Varma, who was then in the north of his state promptly marched his forces to the south and arrived at Kalkulam just in time to prevent its fall to the Dutch.

In the following battle at Colachel (10 August 1741), the Travancore forces won a resounding victory over the Dutch. More than twenty Dutch were taken as prisoners of war from Colachel. Among them was Eustachius de Lannoy, who attracted the king&#x27;s special notice. Eustachius de Lannoy, commonly known in Travancore as the &#x27;Valiya Kappittan&#x27; (Senior Captain) was entrusted with the organisation and drilling of a special regiment, which he did to the &quot;entire satisfaction of the king&quot;. De Lannoy was raised to the rank of general in Travancore army and proved of considerable service to Marthanda Varma in subsequent battles.

=== Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753) ===

* Following the expulsion of the Dutch, Marthanda Varma now turned his attention once again towards Kayamkulam (which continued to seek help from the Dutch Company). In 1742, Travancore forces attacked Kayamkulam possessions at Kollam and fought the Kayamkulam army led by Achuta Warrier and chiefs from Valiya Kakkanadu Madhom. Although Travancore was defeated in this battle, Marthanada Varma reinforced his army with cavalry brought in from Tirunelveli before mounting an attack on Kayamkulam, which led to the final defeat of the chiefdom. A treaty known as the Treaty of Mannar (1742) was signed, under which Kayamkulam became a tributary state of Travancore.
* However, by 1746, the Kayamkulam chief once again showed signs of rebellion and when his &quot;conspiracies&quot; with the northern chiefdoms such as Kottayam, Changanassery, Kochi and Ambalapuzha came to the attention of Marthanda Varma, Kayamkulam was annexed by a final battle in which the chief fled to Kochi and a branch of the family settled near Charamood known as &quot;Moothantedom&quot;. Travancore now extended from Kanyakumari to Kayamkulam in the north.
* Following this, Ambalapuzha, Kottayam and Changanassery were also annexed to Travancore by 1753. The principality of Meenachil was also annexed. 
* In 1753, the tributary states of Kochi collectively known as Karappuram and Alangad were ceded to Travancore. In 1755, the ruler of Kozhikode was also defeated at a battle in Purakkad. He was supported by the armies of some other local chiefs.

The ascent of Travancore seems to have been particularly rapid after about 1749. Marthanda Varma had declared a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch. A treaty (the Treaty of Mavelikkara) was concluded between Marthanda Varma and the Dutch East India Company. It was signed at Mavelikkara on 15August 1753. Thereafter, the Dutch Company officials report that &quot;considerable spice producing lands came under direct royal control, while those merchants participating in illegal trade in spices stood in danger of being executed&quot;.

==Administration==

* Use of maritime outlets: Marthanda Varma made a determined bid to consolidate his authority by the use of Indian Ocean spice trade. The control of ocean trade was crucial for the statecraft of 18th century India. Travancore challenged and eventually broke the Dutch blockade of the southern Malabar Coast.
* Royal monopoly (the Kuttakam): a number of traded goods such as black pepper were defined as royal monopoly items. These items required a state licence for trade in Travancore.
* Dismantling of the old aristocracy - complete restructuring of the medieval political framework: Marthanda Varma reduced the power of the Nair aristocracy (especially the Ettuveettil Pillamar, and their associates, the Yogakkar of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple) in Travancore. Kings of Kerala had earlier been dependent militarily on these powerful community of nobles.
* Patronage to Syrian Christians: To limit the European involvement in trade, Marthanda Varma extended his patronage to the ancient mercantile community in Kerala. The Syrian Christians soon enhanced their position as landholders and those who controlled the new monopoly.
* Extensive bureaucratisation : a Dalava was appointed to head the military, fiscal and commercial administration. Below the Dalava was established an extensive hierarchy, from the Valia Sarvadhi Kariakkars to the Kariakkars, Manikars and Adhikaris. Upper positions of this new system was dominated by Brahmins effectively reduce the Nairs influences in the administration. The old Pandara Kariakkar and Swarupi Janam were replaced by a new administrative system. Divisions known as Adhikaram and Mandapattu Vatukkal were introduced. 
**Dalavas under Marthanda Varma
***Arumukham Pillai 1729–1736
***Thanu Pillai 1736–1737
***Ramayyan Dalavay 1737–1756
***Marthanda Pillai 1756–1758
*Military machine: a substantial standing army, roughly estimated at 50,000, was created. The soldiers were mainly ordinary Nairs who received tax concessions (the Irayili) for the period under service and a pension (the Irayili Aduthoon) on retirement. Marava Cavalry and Pathan Cavalry was also used by Marthanda Varma. Assistance from some defected Dutch officers were also received (after the victory at Colachel). With the beginning of the conflict against Quilon and Kayamkulam (who were being supplied arms by the Dutch), supply of English arms and ammunition also began to increase. Artillery batteries were positioned facing the Arabian Sea from Purakkad to Cape Comorin. Construction of intricate fortifications in Travancore, including the Travancore Lines. 
*Expansion of agricultural production: development of water harvesting and irrigation projects, and the so-called &quot;Kulikkanam&quot; tenure. The Kulikkanam was applicable to &quot;newly planted trees and freshly sown lands&quot;, where a tax reductions (the Naduvukkur and Vettalivu) were granted. The tenure was found along with the Otti tenure, similar to the Kanam tenure (found elsewhere in Kerala). A number of commercial crops were cultivated in lands under this tenure. The Kulikkanam cultivators usually went to the market to sell their goods for cash (and hence the Kulikkanam dues were collected as cash).
*The basis for the changes in the political and economic relations was provided by the transformation of the old agrarian relations. Extensive land survey and settlement.

==Culture and religion==
Marthanda Varma was born a Samanthan Nair. Wanting the status of a (Kshatriya), he performed a set of elaborate and expensive Mahadana rituals as which included the Hiranyagarbha.
Marthanda Varma started normalising the relationship between the royal family (the ruler) and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple (the administrative body of the temple) as soon as he came to the throne. He undertook the Prayaschittam retribution that was long overdue from the earlier Venadu kings. He reorganized the collection of dues from the temple lands. After the land survey of 1739–40, the allotment of expenses for the temple was fixed.

Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram was re-created as the gigantic structure of today and new state ceremonies such as Murajapam, Bhadra Deepam, and others were introduced by Marthanda Varma. The main Vishnu idol of the shrine, which was mostly destroyed in a fire during his predecessor Rama Varma&#x27;s time, was also re-constructed. He also created Ottakkal Mandapam as well as the Sheevelippura. Out of the seven floors of the temple gopura, five were finished during his reign.

Thiruvananthapuram became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. As a result of the annexation of neighbouring chiefdoms, the artists and scholars from these places migrated to Thiruvananthapuram, turning it into a cultural centre. Marthanda Varma gave patronage to different temple art forms including Koothu, Padhakam, Kathakali, Thullal, and Koodiyattam. Noted artists such as Ramapurathu Warrier and Kunchan Nambiar amongst others served as his court poets.

==Thrippadidanam==
In 1749–50, Marthanda Varma decided to &quot;donate&quot; his realm to Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu) and thereafter rule as the deity&#x27;s &quot;vice-regent&quot; (Sri Padmanabha Dasa).

=== Purpose of Thrippadidanam ===

* Separation of the newly formed &quot;unitary kingship&quot; (and political power) from the disputes and frictions in the civil society.
* Formalisation of the new power structure in Travancore.
* To integrate the existing social divisions in Kerala under the emerging power structure.

==Death==
Ramayyan Dalava, prime minister and a close friend of Marthanda Varma, died in 1756. Ramayyan&#x27;s death caused terrible grief to Marthada Varma, and he died two years later in 1758. He was succeeded by his nephew Rama Varma (&quot;Dharma Raja&quot;). Marthanda Varma&#x27;s policies were continued in large measure by Dharma Raja (1758–98). He also went on to successfully defend Travancore against the aggression of the Kingdom of Mysore. Marthanda Varma&#x27;s legacy involved a major restructuring of the medieval political and economic relations of southern Kerala.

<doc id="1256336" wikidata="Q7157359" url="?curid=1256336" title="Peace Dale, Rhode Island">
<text>Peace Dale (also spelled Peacedale) is a village in the town of South Kingstown, Rhode Island, United States. Together with the village of Wakefield, it is treated by the U.S. Census as a component of the census-designated place identified as Wakefield-Peacedale.

The Peace Dale Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1987. The historic district is roughly bounded by Kersey Rd., Oakwoods Dr., Kingstown Rd., School, Church and Railroad Sts., and contains the historic core of the village.

==History==
Peace Dale was established as a village in 1793 by South Kingstown industrialist Rowland Hazard who named the village in honor of his wife, Mary Peace Hazard. Around 1804, Hazard reputedly pioneered the use of carding machines to process wool in Rhode Island. In 1814, Hazard was also one of the first American manufacturers to employ narrow-width power looms, and also was the first woolen manufacturer to combine all his manufacturing processes under one roof, from wool carding through spinning, weaving, and dyeing.

In 1819 Rowland Hazard&#x27;s sons Isaac P. Hazard and Rowland G. Hazard assumed management responsibility for the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company. A third brother, Joseph P. Hazard, joined them as a partner in 1828, and the business took the name &quot;R.G. Hazard &amp; Co.&quot;

Around 1820 the senior Rowland Hazard renamed the nearby industrial village to Wakefield after the town and family of the same name in England, who were friends of his. Prior to this, the village had been called McCoon&#x27;s Mill for the snuff mill that by the 1820s had been converted to manufacturing woolen textiles.

After an 1845 fire destroyed one of the mill buildings, the brothers built new facilities, including expanded hydropower systems and a fireproof stone factory. In 1848 the partnership incorporated, becoming the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company, with Isaac P. Hazard as president and Rowland G. Hazard as secretary/treasurer. In 1849 the business started a transition into making woolen shawls and other high-quality woolens instead of cheaper fabrics.

Later in the 19th century, the sons of Rowland G. Hazard, John N. and Rowland Hazard II (1829–1898), assumed responsibility for operating the Peace Dale Mills. In 1856 Rowland Hazard II, an amateur architect, designed several new buildings in Peace Dale, including a new stone weaving mill and a stone building located across from the mills that housed offices, a store, the village post office, and a public hall. Over the next several decades he influenced the construction and design of numerous additional buildings, accounting for more than half of the built environment of modern Peace Dale. Rowland Hazard II also was an initial investor in the Solvay Process Company, with works at Solvay, New York, and served as the company&#x27;s first president.

Peace Dale&#x27;s mills operated for woolen manufacturing until 1948, when the manufacturing machinery was removed.

The Hazard family also owned and operated the Narragansett Pier Railroad which connected their textile mills in Peace Dale and Wakefield to the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad at Kingston Station (Rhode Island) and to shipping at South Pier in the village of Narragansett Pier.

<text>Guo Xi () ( 1020 – c. 1090) was a Chinese landscape painter from Henan Province who lived during the Northern Song dynasty. One text entitled &quot;The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams&quot; (&quot;Linquan Gaozhi&quot; 林泉高致) is attributed to him. The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is &quot;Early Spring&quot;, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called &quot;the angle of totality.&quot; This type of visual representation is also called &quot;Floating Perspective&quot;, a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation.

The following is an excerpt from his treatise, &quot;mountains and waters&quot;:
The clouds and the vapours of real landscapes are not the same at the four seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer rich and dense, in autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary. When such effects can be seen in pictures, the clouds and vapours have an air of life. The mist around the mountains is not the same at the four seasons. The mountains in spring are light and seductive as if smiling: the mountains in summer have a blue-green colour which seems to be spread over them; the mountains in autumn are bright and tidy as if freshly painted; the mountains in winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping.

Another painting that can be attributed to him is &quot;The Coming of Autumn.&quot; Both paintings capture the seasonal atmosphere and are regarded as important accomplishments of the Song Dynasty. 

Guo Xi was often referred to as a &quot;Northern Song master&quot; when it came to painting. His work inspired many later artists and he even had landscapes dedicated to him. His lesser-known &quot;Deep Valley&quot; scroll painting depicts a serene mountain valley covered with snow and several trees struggling to survive on precipitous cliffs. The ink washes and amorphous brush strokes are employed to model surfaces that suggest the veiling effects of the atmosphere. One of Guo Xi’s techniques was to layer ink washes to build up forms and his &quot;Deep Valley&quot; is a masterpiece of the use of light ink and magnificent composition.

His son later described how Guo Xi approached his work: &quot;On days when he was going to paint, he would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left. He would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean the ink-stone, as though he were expecting a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began.&quot;

<doc id="1256354" wikidata="Q692376" url="?curid=1256354" title="Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands">
<text>Frederiksted (Danish for &quot;Frederik&#x27;s Place&quot;) is both a town and one of the two administrative districts of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. It is a grid-planned city, designed by surveyor Jens Beckfor, originally to 14x14 blocks but built 7x7 to enhance the island commerce in the 1700s. Fewer than 1,000 people live in Frederiksted proper, but nearly 10,000 live on the greater western side of the island. Christiansted (mid-island on the north) is about 30 years older, but commerce was limited by its natural, shallow protective reef. Frederiksted was built in the leeward side of the island (shadow of the wind) for calm seas and a naturally deep port. It is home to Fort Frederik, constructed to protect the town from pirate raids and attacks from rival imperialist nations and named after Frederick V of Denmark, who purchased the Danish West Indies in 1754.
Locals often call Frederiksted &quot;Freedom City&quot;. This nickname has to do with the fact that the town was the site of the emancipation of slaves in the then-Danish West Indies. On July 3, 1848, freed slave and skilled craftsman Moses Gottlieb, also known as &quot;General Buddhoe&quot;, led the uprising, organized slaves on St. Croix&#x27;s West End plantations, and marched on Frederiksted. The emancipation of slaves was proclaimed on July 3, 1848, at Fort Frederik on the waterfront at the northern edge of Frederiksted by Governor-General Peter von Scholten.

Frederiksted is home to one of two deep water ports on St. Croix and is the sole port for cruise ships visiting the island. Passengers disembark at the Frederiksted Pier, where they may explore the town, enjoy the beaches, rent a car, or catch a taxi that to other points of interest on St. Croix. The other deep water port is at the South Port and includes the tank farm of the former Hovensa oil refinery and Renaissance Industrial Park. Several government offices occupy historic buildings in the town.

In the early 2000s, Frederiksted was briefly a port for Seaborne Airlines seaplanes, which are based in Christiansted. Seaplane service ended after less than a year when a tropical storm damaged the port facility.

==History==

The 1867 Virgin Islands earthquake and tsunami heavily damaged the town. The tsunami with an estimated height of 7.6 meters beached the USS &quot;Monongahela&quot; onshore. At least five people were killed.

The town was destroyed by a labor revolt (known as &quot;The Fireburn&quot; because arson was utilized as a means of revolt) in October 1878, which was led by four Crucian female laborers. Frederiksted was restored during the Victorian era, as reflected in its architecture.

Modern Frederiksted operates at a slower pace than Christiansted, except for carnival in January and whenever cruise ships dock in its deepwater port. In recent years successful redevelopment efforts have begun to restore and revitalize this National Historic Site. The 2000 census population of the town was 732, and that of the larger sub-district was 3,767.

== Renovation and revitalization ==
Several companies have drafted plans to refurbish and enhance the greater Frederiksted area. The Public Finance Authority retained Coastal Systems to develop concepts for a waterfront park, beach, cruise pier, and other site improvements. Teams of land planners, engineers, and landscape architects met with local interest groups to develop plans for redevelopment of the area. Environmental regulatory surveys and permits were managed by the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Agency of the USVI. Phase I of the project was completed, which consisted of the reconstruction of the waterfront park while maintaining the historical facade representative of St. Croix&#x27;s heritage. Natural stonework was used throughout the project site in accordance with the local architectural style.

Phase II of the project will involve reconstruction of the community waterfront north of the fort and re-creation of breakwaters, reconstruction of Paul E. Joseph Stadium, and restoration of the beach, restroom facilities, retaining pond, utilities, parking areas, and soccer fields.

== Volunteers, community, and art ==
Volunteerism is a big part of Frederiksted. Clean Sweep Frederiksted engages volunteers in community cleanups, mural and garden projects, and other opportunities. It also worked with the Artists Guild of St. Croix to install dozens of painted rum barrels as community trash bins. The Artists Guild of St. Croix has installed several murals and paintings, and sponsors scholarships. Delta Dorsch, who was born in Frederiksted, wrote &quot;The Role of the Storyteller in the Preservation of Virgin Islands Culture&quot; (1999) and contributed to &quot;The Glory Days of Frederiksted&quot; (2004) about Frederiksted&#x27;s culture.&quot;&quot;

== Climate ==

Frederiksted has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) featuring very warm to hot weather year-round.

Water temperatures are usually around in winter and in September. The waters are typically very calm, as Frederiksted is in the leeward side (shadow of the island&#x27;s wind) with about a tide.

The sunrise varies from 5:30 a.m. in summer to 7:00 a.m. in winter. Sunset varies between 5:40 p.m. in winter to 7:10 p.m. in summer. St. Croix does not use Daylight Saving Time. The ultraviolet index varies from 10+ in the summer and a maximum of 7 in winter.

Persistent easterly trade winds, moving from east to west across the island year round create a cool breeze.

Rainforests occur on the western side of St. Croix due to the topography featuring peaks, which gather moisture from the trade winds. This rainforest climate is unique to the Frederiksted side of St. Croix.

* 1984 Nov. Category 1 Hurricane Klaus (1984) caused severe flooding 
* 1989, Sept. Category 4 Hugo devastated ~85% of St. Croix, destroying the Old Frederiksted Pier

<text>Stewart-Warner was an American manufacturer of vehicle instruments (e.g., gauges and lubricating equipment) and many other products.

==History==

The company was founded as Stewart &amp; Clark Company in 1905 by John K. Stewart. Their speedometers were used in the Ford Model T. In 1912 John Stewart joined with Edgar Bassick to make vehicle instruments and horns. Bassick owned Alemite Co. and Stewart had bought the Warner Instrument Company; thus the name was changed to the Stewart-Warner Corporation. The company started in Chicago and built a manufacturing plant on Diversey Parkway. The building kept expanding and finally covered one million square feet (93,000 m²) and six floors. At its peak S-W employed 6000 people at the Diversey complex. They also made radios and refrigerators, among other products, and produced the ubiquitous &quot;zerk&quot; grease fitting, named after its inventor, associated with the company. In the last years of the company&#x27;s Chicago factory, it owned a number of aging six-spindle Brown &amp; Sharpe and New Britain screw machines.

Stewart-Warner had other locations, including at 2600 North Pulaski in Chicago, and in later years a distribution center in Elgin, Illinois, located just south of I-90 and east of Rt. 25. The company also opened a plant in Harlow, Essex, England in the late 1950s, which became its European headquarters. Stan Hagerman initially was Director of the UK plant, followed by Curtis W. Van Allen in 1960, who later became vice president and general manager of international operations in Chicago.

The Diversey Parkway complex was the site of both S-W&#x27;s international headquarters and the Instrument &amp; Alemite manufacturing operations. &quot;Alemite&quot; referred to S-W&#x27;s line of lubricating stations, and &quot;Instruments&quot; referred to speedometers and similar gauges. The front that faced Diversey was the location of corporate offices, while to the rear was manufacturing with a warehouse south of Diversey. A large employee cafeteria was inside the main building, which also included an underground garage for executives (including CEO Bennett Archambault, who arrived each morning by limousine) with an entrance off Wolcott just north of Diversey. Corporate archives were housed in the basement below the main tower, and executive offices were in the top floors of the tower. Stewart-Warner operated a free shuttle van service for employees who commuted by train to and from the Clybourn Metra (C&amp;NW) station. In 1981 S-W experienced a labor strike at the Chicago operations. The Elgin site was eventually taken over by Middleby Corporation.

The main Chicago plant and headquarters of Stewart-Warner along Diversey Parkway in Chicago were located in the Deering Industrial Area in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood. As such, S-W was served by both the Chicago and North Western Railroad on the north side, and by both the Milwaukee Road and C&amp;NW on the south end at the warehouse north of Clybourn and east of Wolcott. In later years S-W was served by only the C&amp;NW off tracks along the east side of the S-W plant and parallel to the C&amp;NW North Line.

The company also made heat exchangers starting in the 1940s under the South Wind Division, but after then, it became independent of its parent. Stewart-Warner ranked 95th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

Stewart-Warner was also a manufacturer and distributor of scoreboards, beginning in 1966. Scoreboards created and installed by Stewart-Warner during the 1960s and 1970s included those at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York; Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium; Fenway Park in Boston, Tiger Stadium in Detroit; Exhibition Stadium in Toronto; Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Anaheim Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium and Royals Stadium in Kansas City; Aloha Stadium in Honolulu; Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey; McNichols Sports Arena and Mile High Stadium in Denver; Milwaukee County Stadium in Wisconsin; Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh; Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum in Philadelphia; Busch Stadium in St. Louis; and the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. The latter featured the first videoscreen in a stadium or arena, the Telscreen.
In 1963, Stewart-Warner established an integrated circuit fabrication facility, Stewart-Warner Microcircuits, in Sunnyvale, California.

In the mid-1980s, Stewart-Warner&#x27;s scoreboard division was sold off to another Chicago company, White Way Sign, which took over the maintenance, upgrading and replacement of most of these aforementioned scoreboards.

The last CEO of Stewart-Warner was Bennett Archambault, who died in 1996. He was appointed president and CEO in 1954.

On September 9, 1987, British Tire &amp; Rubber BTR plc entered into an agreement to purchase Stewart-Warner. In 1989, new owner BTR decided to relocate operations to Juarez, Mexico, and shut down the Chicago plant and offices, which at the time still employed 700 workers. BTR eventually spun off its Stewart-Warner instruments business to a company named Stewart-Warner Instruments Corporation. In early 1998 Stewart-Warner Instruments Corporation was bought by Datcon Instrument Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania (later renamed to Maxima Technologies). Maxima Technologies was then acquired by Actuant Inc., now called Enerpac Tool Group, a diversified multi-national industrial corporation in 2006, and renamed Maximatecc. Currently Stewart-Warner is headquartered in Lancaster, and is a part of Enerpac&#x27;s Engineered Solutions Business Segment.

On April 25, 1993, a fire destroyed most of the empty Stewart-Warner Chicago headquarters and factory buildings. What was left was demolished and replaced by condominiums.

<doc id="1256358" wikidata="Q7027862" url="?curid=1256358" title="Nick Sakiewicz">
<text>Nicolaus Sakiewicz ( ; born January 14, 1961) is the former chief business officer of the Arizona Coyotes of the National Hockey League. From January 7, 2016, until February 23, 2022, he was the commissioner of the National Lacrosse League.

Previously, Sakiewicz was a founder, operating partner and CEO of the Philadelphia Union and a former professional soccer goalkeeper. He is a 21-year veteran of Major League Soccer and was part of a small group of people that started the League in 1995.

Until October 2015, Sakiewicz was the CEO and Operating Partner of Keystone Sports &amp; Entertainment, LLC, the ownership group of the Philadelphia Union. He played in both the Major Indoor Soccer League and American Professional Soccer League and coached at the youth and college levels. Sakiewicz has been the CEO of Hartford Athletic, a USL-Championship professional soccer club.

==Early life and playing career==

Sakiewicz, the son of a Polish immigrant father and mother, attended the University of New Haven where he played on the school&#x27;s NCAA Division II soccer team from 1979 to 1982. He was a 1981, 1982 and 1983 All New England and 1982 Division II Second Team All American goalkeeper. After graduating from New Haven, he moved to Europe where he played in FC Nantes as a developmental player. He also spent a short time with Belenenses of Portugal in 1984. He returned to the United States and played for the New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League during the 1983–1984 season. He spent an extended hiatus from the professional game after a serious leg injury and pursued business opportunities, continuing with the game by coaching and playing at the amateur level. In 1990, he returned to the professional game for one season with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the American Professional Soccer League.
Following his retirement as a player, Sakiewicz coached youth soccer in Florida and was an assistant coach with the College of Boca Raton.
In the late 1980s, Sakiewicz was a co-owner of the South Florida-based Ezell-Titterton Inc.

==Major League Soccer==
In 1995, Sakeiwicz joined Major League Soccer as a founding executive and was named the first Vice President of Commercial Sponsorship Sales for the league. During his tenure as an MLS executive, Sakiewicz helped grow the league from ten teams in 1996 to 23 teams before leaving for the NLL in late 2015.

===Tampa Bay Mutiny===

In October 1996, he became the President and General Manager of the Tampa Bay Mutiny.[5] and was named MLS Executive of the Year in 1999.

===New York MetroStars===

In 2000, he left to become president and General Manager of the MetroStars and won a second consecutive MLS executive of the year after the MetroStars finished atop the Eastern Division in the regular season. Over five seasons the MetroStars appeared in the 2003 U.S. Open Cup final and qualified for the MLS playoffs four times, but only won one playoff series. The team improved their sponsorship revenue and local broadcasting contracts under his management. Sakiewicz helped engineer the deal the build a soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena.

During the 2005 season, Sakiewicz was promoted to President of AEG New York, LLC, where he oversaw the record-breaking $100 million sale of the MetroStars to Red Bull Energy Drink Company in 2006. In November 2007 he left AEG to become the co-founder and CEO of the Philadelphia Union, which were announced as the 16th MLS franchise in February 2008 and began play in 2010.

===Philadelphia Union===

Sakiewicz led all efforts in planning and construction of the Union&#x27;s soccer-specific stadium PPL Park, including securing naming rights and other key sponsorships.

On October 2, 2015, Sakiewicz was removed from his duties as CEO and Operating Partner of the Philadelphia Union. Majority owner Jay Sugarman cited a difference in philosophy regarding the management of the franchise as the reason for his dismissal. Sakiewicz had also developed a contentious relationship with fans and the local media. In May 2015 he was the target of a protest by Philadelphia Union fans at PPL Park. Following his dismissal, allegations arose that Sakiewicz had threatened members of the local media with libel suits for their reporting on the franchise.

On January 7, 2016, Sakiewicz was introduced as the fifth commissioner in the history of the National Lacrosse League.

== National Lacrosse League ==

Since taking over as commissioner, Sakiewicz has partnered with Twitter to live stream select games, increased ticket sales and led the way in launching NLL TV. In March 2018, Sakiewicz secured the largest media rights deal in the history of the league, partnering with B/R Live, Turner&#x27;s live streaming service, for all games to be streamed on the platform starting with the 2018–2019 season.

Under Sakiewicz&#x27;s watch, the league has seen attendance growth for three consecutive years and games routinely average 10,000 fans per game.

Sakiewicz&#x27;s biggest impact has come with league expansion. The last time the league added expansion franchises before Sakiewicz took over as commissioner was in 2007, when the Chicago Shamrox and the New York Titans joined the league. Starting with the 2008 season, the league saw continued consolidation, with the league going from 13 teams in 2007 to nine teams in 2012.

Under his watch, the NLL has grown back to 13 teams, and Sakiewicz has repeatedly stated his intention to grow the league by two teams per year to eventually reach 20–30 teams.

Sakiewicz&#x27;s biggest initiative for expansion franchises is to get what he calls &quot;blue-chip owners&quot; in the league, with teams who have favorable arena deals and to be in a good sports and entertainment market.

The first team to be announced as an expansion franchise was the San Diego Seals on August 30, 2007. Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba Group, was announced as the ownership group. Two weeks later, on September 14, 2017, the NLL awarded an expansion franchise to Comcast Spectacor to return the Wings to Philadelphia. Tsai and Comcast each paid a reported $5 million for their expansion franchises.

On September 13, 2018, Sakiewicz announced that the Rochester KnightHawks would be moving to Halifax, Nova Scotia for the 2019–2020 season. Rochester will be awarded an expansion franchise under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula, who also own the Buffalo Bandits.

On December 11, 2018, Sakiewicz announced that New York would be awarded an expansion franchise to begin play during the 2019–2020 season. The team will play at the newly renovated NYCB LIVE, home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, and will be owned by live events and sports media entertainment company GF Sports

Sakiewicz also oversaw the sale and move of the Vancouver Stealth from previous owner, Denise Watkins, to the Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment group. The Stealth moved from Langley Events Centre to the Rogers Arena and were rebranded as the Vancouver Warriors, starting with the 2018–2019 season.

On February 23, 2022, the NLL announced that Sakiewicz &quot;has decided to leave his current position (as NLL Commissioner) to pursue other interests but will continue to advise the league until June 30, 2022&quot;.

<text>Carl Adolph Agardh (23 January 1785 in Båstad, Sweden – 28 January 1859 in Karlstad) was a Swedish botanist specializing in algae, who was eventually appointed bishop of Karlstad.

== Biography ==

In 1807 he was appointed teacher of mathematics at Lund University, in 1812 appointed professor of botany and natural sciences, and was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1817, and of the Swedish Academy in 1831.

He was ordained a clergyman in 1816, received two parishes as prebend, and was a representative in the clerical chamber of the Swedish Parliament on several occasions from 1817. He was rector magnificus of Lund University 1819-1820 and was appointed bishop of Karlstad in 1835, where he remained until his death. He was the father of Jacob Georg Agardh, also a botanist.

== System of plant classification ==

The &quot;Classes Plantarum&quot; has nine primary divisions into which his classes and natural orders are grouped. These are, with class numbers; 
# Acotyledonae 1–3 (Algae, Lichenes, Fungi)
# Pseudocotyledonae 4–7 (Muscoideae, Tetradidymae, Filices, Equisetaceae)
# Cryptocotyledonae 8–12 (Macropodae, Spadicinae, Glumiflorae, Liliiflorae, Gynandrae)
# Phanerocotyledonae incompletae 13–16 (Micranthae, Oleraceae, Epichlamydeae, Columnantherae)
# Phanerocotyledonae completae, hypogynae, monopetalae 17 (Tubiflorae)
# Phanerocotyledonae completae, hypogynae, polypetalae 18–22 (Centrisporae, Brevistylae, Polycarpellae, Valvisporae, Columniferae)
# Phanerocotyledonae completae, discigynae, monopetalae 23 (Tetraspermae)
# Phanerocotyledonae completae, discigynae, polypetalae 24–26 (Gynobaseae, Trihilitae, Hypodicarpae) 
# Phanerocotyledonae completae, porigynae 27–33 (Subaggregatae, Aridifoliae, Succulentae, Calycanthemae, Peponiferae, Icosandrae, Leguminosae)

Each class then contains a number of orders (families). For instance, Liliiflorae contains 11 orders;
* Liliiflorae
** 43 Asparageae
** 44 Asphodeleae
** 45 Coronariae
** 46 Veratreae
** 47 Commelineae
** 48 Pontedereae
** 49 Dioscorinae
** 50 Haemodoreae
** 51 Irideae
** 52 Narcisseae
** 53 Bromeliaceae

Specimens collected by Agardh are cared for in herbaria including the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria

== Publications ==

He devoted considerable attention to political economy and as &quot;a leading liberal&quot;, he &quot;succeeded in improving and raising the standards of education in Sweden&quot;. He also wrote on theological and other subjects, but his reputation chiefly rests on his botanical works, especially &quot;Systema algarum&quot;, &quot;Species algarum rite cognitae&quot; and &quot;Classes plantarum&quot; on biological classification, and &quot;Icones Algarum&quot; (1824, 1820–28, and 1828–35). The greatest part of his &quot;Manual of Botany&quot; (2 vols., Malmoe, 1829–32) has been translated into German.

<doc id="1256378" wikidata="Q520594" url="?curid=1256378" title="Jacob Georg Agardh">
<text>Jacob Georg Agardh (8 December 1813 in Lund, Sweden – 17 January 1901 in Lund, Sweden) was a Swedish botanist, phycologist, and taxonomist.

==Early life and career==
He was the son of Carl Adolph Agardh, and from 1854 until 1879 was professor of botany at Lund University. Agardh designed the current 1862 blueprints for the botanical garden Botaniska trädgården in Lund.

In 1849, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Agardh was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878. It is said that the naturalist Mary Philadelphia Merrifield learnt Swedish in order that she could correspond with him.

==Australian female collectors and Mueller==

Ferdinand von Mueller, as the Government Botanist of Victoria from 1853 to 1896, played an important role in facilitating the study of Australian flora, including algae. Mueller established an extensive network of collectors across Australia, many of whom were women. He actively encouraged these female collectors to gather specimens, which he then sent to specialists around the world for identification and description. In the case of algae, Mueller regularly corresponded with Agardh in Sweden, who was a leading expert in phycology. Mueller would send Agardh specimens collected by his network of female botanists, along with any relevant information about the specimens. Agardh would then identify and sometimes describe new species based on these specimens.

Agardh received specimens and assistance from several female botanical collectors in Australia during his work on Australian algae. These included Louisa Atkinson, who collected specimens at Berrima and the Blue Mountains in New South Wales in the 1860s–1870s; Miss Goodwin, who collected algae specimens at George Town, Tasmania in the late 1860s; Jessie Hussey, who collected extensively in South Australia in the 1890s and corresponded directly with Agardh after Mueller&#x27;s death; Jemima Frances Irvine, who collected algae specimens in Western Australia in the late 1880s; and Mary Lodder, who collected algae in Tasmania in the late 1880s. Agardh named several algal species after these collectors, including &quot;Dasya feredayae&quot; and &quot;Nemastoma feredayae&quot; after Susan Fereday, &quot;Kallymenia nitophylloides&quot; after Nina Hodgkinson, and &quot;Lenormandia hypoglossum&quot; and &quot;Curdiea irvineae&quot; after Jemima Irvine. Ferdinand von Mueller often acted as an intermediary, forwarding specimens from these collectors to Agardh in Sweden for identification and description.

==Works and Botanical Collecting==
His principal work, &quot;Species, Genera et Ordines Algarum&quot; (4 vols., Lund, 1848–63), was a standard authority.
Specimens collected by Agardh are cared for by the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria

<doc id="1256380" wikidata="Q2063903" url="?curid=1256380" title="Vio-lence">
<text>Vio-lence is an American thrash metal band formed in 1985 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Throughout its career, they have released demo tapes, three EPs and three studio albums. Vio-lence is best-known for their association with the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene, and often credited as one of the leading lights of the second wave of the genre. They are also considered to be a member of the &quot;Big Six of Bay Area Thrash Metal,&quot; alongside Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, Lȧȧz Rockit and Forbidden.

Vio-lence&#x27;s most stable lineup was Phil Demmel and Robb Flynn on guitars, Deen Dell on bass, Perry Strickland on drums and Sean Killian on vocals; this lineup recorded all three of their studio albums–&quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot; (1988), &quot;Oppressing the Masses&quot; (1990) and &quot;Nothing to Gain&quot; (1993). After breaking up in 1994 and reforming for occasional live performances from 2001 to 2003, the band reunited once again in January 2019, and released the EP &quot;Let the World Burn&quot;, their first collection of new material in nearly three decades, in March 2022. The current lineup of Vio-lence includes Killian along with live members Mario Salcedo, Nick Souza and Max Mayhem.

==History==
===Initial career===
Vio-lence, then-called Death Penalty, was formed in 1985 with the lineup of lead guitarist Phil Demmel, drummer Perry Strickland, rhythm guitarist Troy Fua, lead vocalist Jerry Birr and bassist Eddie Billy (brother of musicians Andy and Chuck Billy). Not long after playing their first gig, which reportedly took place at a house party, Death Penalty changed their name to Violence and eventually then to Vio-lence, as the former was taken by another band. After recording two demos in 1986, they parted ways with Birr, Fua and Billy, who were replaced by Sean Killian, Robb Flynn (formerly of Forbidden Evil) and Deen Dell respectively. Their live success at local clubs in Northern California – opening for bands like D.R.I., Voivod, Kreator, Dark Angel, Suicidal Tendencies and the Mentors, as well as their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament, Exodus, Death Angel, Lȧȧz Rockit and Heathen – allowed Vio-lence to record another demo, this time for major labels, including MCA Records&#x27; sister label Mechanic, who offered them a recording contract.

From February to April 1988, Vio-lence recorded their debut album, &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, at two studios: The Music Grinder in Los Angeles and Alpha &amp; Omega in San Francisco. The album received mostly positive reviews upon its release in the summer of 1988, and peaked at number 154 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the band&#x27;s only album to enter that chart; this can be attributed to the album selling over 30,000 copies. Vio-lence toured throughout 1988 and 1989 in support of &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, with bands such as Testament, Voivod, Death Angel, Sanctuary, Nuclear Assault, D.R.I., M.O.D. and the Cro-Mags. The underground success of the album also caught the attention of several labels, including Megaforce Records (then-home to bands such as Testament, M.O.D., Anthrax, and Overkill), who eventually signed the band.

In December 1989, Vio-lence entered the studio to record what would be their second album and only release on Megaforce (distributed by Atlantic) &quot;Oppressing the Masses&quot;; however, the album faced multiple delays until its release in the summer of 1990. Although the album&#x27;s success did not match that of &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, it received some positive reviews and a video for the song &quot;World in a World&quot; was released. &quot;Oppressing the Masses&quot; also generated some controversy, when the original album (which reportedly sold only 20,000 copies) was destroyed because of Atlantic&#x27;s objection to the lyrical content of &quot;Torture Tactics&quot;; as a result, the album was reprinted without this track. Vio-lence toured in support of the album for about a year, with bands such as Overkill, Exodus, Forbidden, Flotsam and Jetsam, Prong, Defiance and Rigor Mortis.

In 1991, after being dropped from Atlantic/Megaforce, Vio-lence released an EP &quot;Torture Tactics&quot;, which included three studio songs (recorded in 1989 during the sessions of &quot;Oppressing the Masses&quot;) and one &quot;live&quot; track from 1988. Internal conflicts in 1992 resulted in the departure of Robb Flynn who would move on to form groove metal band Machine Head. A year later, Vio-lence released their third and final album, &quot;Nothing to Gain&quot;, which was actually recorded in 1990. They never toured in support of that album, and Strickland left the band after its release.

===Breakup===
After an attempt to make a fourth album, and performing what would be their final show for eight years on December 18, 1993, with a new lineup in San Francisco, Vio-lence split up. Phil Demmel, Deen Dell, Ray Vegas and Mark Hernandez formed a groove/thrash metal band called Torque which disbanded after releasing a studio album and playing several live shows. Demmel then went to form Technocracy. Robb Flynn has been the guitarist and singer of Machine Head since its inception in 1991. Demmel joined Machine Head in 2003, first as a session guitarist and later becoming a full-time member of the band; he would stay in Machine Head until his departure in 2018.

===Reunion===
Initially planning only a few shows as part of the tribute to Testament frontman Chuck Billy during the &quot;Thrash of the Titans&quot; benefit in 2001, the band decided to reunite with early guitarist Ray Vegas replacing Robb Flynn. In addition to their 2005 re-release of &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, the band released a 7-inch vinyl record containing two demo tracks from their original 1986 demo tape as well as one previously unreleased track. Only 1000 copies were produced and pressed by Bone Crusher Records. The 7 inch collectible was well marketed and advertised, but due to disagreements between the band and the Bone Crusher record producers, only Vio-lence was allowed to distribute and sell the 500 given to them by the producers. A deal was made to distribute a small quantity (about 100) through a Seattle record store, the only known store to stock the item for sale to the public. A DVD entitled &quot;Blood and Dirt&quot; was produced by Jerry Allen (Tales From The Pit video magazine) and released on August 8, 2006, through Megaforce.

On November 6, 2017, it was announced that the members of Vio-Lence would reunite for a performance at &quot;Killian on Command: An Evening of Vio-Lence&quot;, a benefit for the band&#x27;s singer Sean Killian, who was diagnosed with stage four liver cirrhosis earlier that summer. The benefit took place at The Midway in San Francisco, California on January 20, 2018, and included performances by the members of Vio-Lence and their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament, Exodus, Death Angel, Forbidden and Mordred. The show concluded with a performance of &quot;World in a World&quot; featuring four-fifths of the &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Oppressing the Masses&quot; lineup; vocals were provided by Flynn instead of Killian, who did not perform due to his health condition. On November 11, 2018, Killian&#x27;s wife Dana posted a photo on her personal Facebook page, cryptically confirming that her husband has recovered from his illness.

The possibility of a Vio-lence reunion was renewed in September 2018 when Flynn announced that guitarist Phil Demmel was leaving Machine Head after a farewell tour with then-current lineup of Flynn, Demmel, Jared MacEachern and Dave McClain; at first it was speculated that Machine Head was actually breaking up, but Flynn announced shortly thereafter that he was going to continue the band with a new lineup. Musical outlets reported in November 2018 that, following Demmel&#x27;s departure from Machine Head, there were rumors Vio-lence would reform &quot;in the not-too-distant future&quot; for shows and possibly new music. On January 8, 2019, it was announced that Vio-lence would reunite for a performance on April 13 at the Metro in Oakland to perform their debut album, &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot;, in its entirety. The show intended as a one-off sold out shortly after its announcement, resulting in a matinee appearance at the Metro, which took place on the following day. On February 16, 2019, it was announced that Vio-lence would play their first European show at the Alcatraz Metal Fest in Kortrijk, Belgium that August. In addition to their first live appearance in Los Angeles in over a decade on May 31, 2019, at The Regent with Sacred Reich, Excel and Sworn Enemy, they played their first shows in New York in nearly 30 years at the Brooklyn Bazaar on November 8–9. The band also will reportedly play shows with their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament and Death Angel, and has continued their reunion with more shows into 2020. On August 9, 2019, Bloodstock Open Air announced that Vio-lence would be playing their first ever and only UK show at the festival in 2020.

The members of Vio-lence have expressed their desire to write the follow-up to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Nothing to Gain&quot;. In an August 2019 interview with Australia&#x27;s &quot;Heavy&quot; magazine, Demmel said, &quot;Sean&#x27;s itching to write some new music. I&#x27;m not itching as hard. I&#x27;ve got a lot on my plate. Vio-lence is definitely a priority, but that&#x27;s just a step I haven&#x27;t... It&#x27;s hard, because you have this comeback, and then you play the songs, and you want to be good. I don&#x27;t want to put out something that isn&#x27;t as good as &quot;Eternal Nightmare&quot; or some of the songs from &quot;Oppressing&quot;. I want to have something that&#x27;s quality.&quot; In an interview with Exodus frontman Steve &quot;Zetro&quot; Souza on his &quot;Toxic Vault&quot; video channel, Killian stated, &quot;Phil and I have talked a couple of times. It&#x27;s kind of up to him because he is very busy doing a soundtrack for a video game and I guess a Netflix series, and he&#x27;s doing Allegiance and these other things he&#x27;s doing.&quot; Killian also said that the other members of Vio-lence are interested in writing a new album; however, he concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s Phil and I that need to connect.&quot; In January 2020, Ray Vegas announced that he had left Vio-lence and was replaced by former Overkill guitarist Bobby Gustafson. Longtime bassist Deen Dell left the band shortly thereafter and was replaced by former Fear Factory bassist Christian Olde Wolbers. In March 2020, it was announced that Vio-lence had signed to Metal Blade Records and the band was going to record a new EP in the coming months. On August 20, 2020, Vio-lence released their first song in over 25 years, which was a cover of Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;California über alles&quot;.

On June 16, 2021, Vio-lence announced &quot;Let the World Burn&quot; as the title of their new EP, which was planned for release in early 2022. Prior to its release, the band was scheduled to be headlining the 2021 installment of the Headbangers Ball Tour in Europe, with support from Voivod, Exciter and Artillery, but it was postponed to the next year due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 10, 2022, a lyric video for &quot;Flesh from Bone&quot; was released, and on the same day, the band announced that &quot;Let the World Burn&quot; would be released on March 4. About a week prior to the release of &quot;Let the World Burn&quot;, Demmel revealed that Vio-lence had begun writing new material for their next EP, which he had hoped would be recorded in the fall of 2022 for a tentative 2023 release. On October 20, 2022, the band announced that they have parted ways with Gustafson. In February 2023, it was announced Strickland had quit the band &quot;a month prior&quot;. The band later clarified that Strickland did not quit the band, implying that he was fired. On February 5, 2024, Phil Demmel announced that he was leaving the band and that his final show with Vio-lence would be performed on February 11, leaving vocalist Sean Killian as the only constant member. Said Demmel, &quot;given the latest state of the band and where I feel I belong with it, or feel tied to it, I just think my time is at an end.&quot; On February 24, 2025, Wolbers departed the band to focus on his solo band and producing career.

<text>Madrepora (Spanish, &quot;mother of pores&quot;) is a genus of stony corals, often found forming reefs or islands in tropical locations. The names Madrepore and Madreporaria were formerly applied universally to any stony coral of the family Scleractinia. They reproduce in three separate ways, as discovered by the marine zoologist Anne Thynne (1800–1866). It is commonly known as horn coral. A colony is branched with small polyps in cylindrical cups separated by a perforated coenosteum. Terminal polyps bear six tentacles, while lateral polyps bear twelve tentacles. Madrepora is economically important, since it contributes to the formation of coral reefs.

==Species==
Species include:
* &quot;Madrepora arbuscula&quot; 
* &quot;Madrepora astroites&quot; 
* &quot;Madrepora carolina&quot; 
* &quot;Madrepora minutiseptum&quot; 
* &quot;Madrepora oculata&quot;

<doc id="1256388" wikidata="Q7304762" url="?curid=1256388" title="Red Queen's race">
<text>The Red Queen&#x27;s race is an incident that appears in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; and involves both the Red Queen, a representation of a Queen in chess, and Alice constantly running but remaining in the same spot.
&quot;Well, in our country,&quot; said Alice, still panting a little, &quot;you&#x27;d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we&#x27;ve been doing.&quot;

&quot;A slow sort of country!&quot; said the Queen. &quot;Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!&quot; 
The Red Queen&#x27;s race is often used to illustrate similar situations:
* In evolutionary biology, to illustrate that sexual reproduction and the resulting genetic recombination may be just enough to allow individuals of a certain species to adapt to changes in their environment—see Red Queen hypothesis.
* As an illustration of the relativistic effect that nothing can ever reach the speed of light, or the invariant speed; in particular, with respect to relativistic effect on light from galaxies near the edge of the expanding observable universe, or at the event horizon of a black hole.
* Isaac Asimov used it in his short story &quot;The Red Queen&#x27;s Race&quot; to illustrate the concept of predestination paradox.
* In environmental sociology, to illustrate Allan Schnaiberg&#x27;s concept of the treadmill of production where actors are perpetually driven to accumulate capital and expand the market in an effort to maintain relative economic and social position.
* Vernor Vinge used it in his novel &quot;Rainbows End&quot; to illustrate the struggle between encouraging technological advancement and protecting the world from new weapons technologies.
* James A. Robinson and Daron Acemoglu used it in their political science book The Narrow Corridor to illustrate the competition and cooperation required between state and society required to support the spread of liberty.
* Andrew F. Krepinevich used it in his article &quot;The New Nuclear Age: How China’s Growing Nuclear Arsenal Threatens Deterrence&quot; to illustrate how in a tripolar nuclear power system it is not possible for each state to maintain nuclear parity with the combined arsenals of its two rivals.
* Marc Reisner referenced the Red Queen in his book &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; to describe a growing Los Angeles’ quest for water. As the city swelled in population, it required more and more water sources just to maintain a supply barely enough to sate its residents and farms.
* Steve Blank used it in his article “The Red Queen Problem - Innovation in the DoD and Intelligence Community” as a metaphor for how the US Department of Defense and Intelligence community are not able to keep pace with their adversaries in the 21st century because of their outdated approach to technological innovation.
* Mark Atherton used it in fraud detection and other areas of fighting online attackers to describe the never ending struggle to combat relentless adversaries.
* Jay-Z compared the struggle for Black liberation to the Red Queen’s race in his song “Legacy”: “That’s called the Red Queen’s Race/You run this hard just to stay in place/Keep up the pace, baby/Keep up the pace.”

<doc id="1256391" wikidata="Q6774437" url="?curid=1256391" title="Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital">
<text>Martha Jefferson Hospital is a Sentara Healthcare-owned nonprofit community hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was founded in 1903 by eight local physicians. The 176-bed hospital has an employed staff of 1,600 and has 365 affiliated physicians.

The hospital owns 10 primary care and three specialty practices. Major services include a Cancer Care Center, Digestive Care Center, Cardiology Care Center, Orthopedics including Spine Surgery &amp; Joint Replacement Surgery, Bariatric (Weight Loss) Surgery, Neurosciences including Neurosurgery and a Sleep Medicine Center, Stroke Care Center, Thoracic Surgery, Vascular Medicine &amp; Surgery, and a Women&#x27;s Health Center.

== Relocation ==
Over the years, the hospital expanded at its downtown-Charlottesville location on Locust Avenue. However, in the early 2000s, it was clear a new facility needed to be built to accommodate a growing number of patients and the ability to expand further in a more open area. The hospital chose an campus adjacent to their current Outpatient Care Center on Pantops Mountain for the new facility.

=== Design and construction ===
The new building is designed by Kahler Slater of Milwaukee, WI. Engineering firms include Graef, Anhult, Schloemer &amp; Associates of Milwaukee; Ring &amp; DuChateau of Milwaukee; Rummel, Klepper &amp; Kahi LLP of Richmond, VA and Hughes, Good, O&#x27;Leary and Ryan of Atlanta, GA. The general contractor was M. A. Mortenson Company of Brookfield, Wisconsin.

The new building has five floors and a basement. There are two wings for patient rooms, the Wendel Wing and the Cornell Wing, as well as a cancer wing, the Phillips Family Cancer Center. The emergency department is located on the southwest end of the second floor. The maternity ward is located in the central area of the third floor. Visitor access, as well as retail space, is located on the Northeast side of the third floor. The cafeteria is located on the northeast side of the fourth floor.

=== Sale of the old facility ===
In September 2010, Martha Jefferson Hospital sold its downtown Charlottesville building to Octagon Partners. Octagon Partners later announced that the CFA Institute would move into a portion of the re-developed facility in 2013.

== Merger ==
On September 29, 2010, Martha Jefferson Hospital announced its intention to merge with Sentara Healthcare. The merger was finalized on June 1, 2011, making Martha Jefferson the tenth hospital of Sentara Healthcare&#x27;s not-for-profit integrated health system, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia.

<doc id="1256394" wikidata="Q272750" url="?curid=1256394" title="Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz">
<text>Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz (pseudonym, Actaea; Cary; December 5, 1822 – June 27, 1907) was an American educator, naturalist, writer, and the co-founder and first president of Radcliffe College. A researcher of natural history, she was an author and illustrator of natural history texts as well as a co-author of natural history texts with her husband, Louis Agassiz, and her stepson Alexander Agassiz.

Agassiz traveled to Brazil with her husband from 1865 to 1866, and on the Hassler expedition from 1871 to 1872; of the second, she wrote an account for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. She published &quot;A First Lesson in Natural History&quot; (Boston, 1859) and edited &quot;Geological Sketches&quot; (1866).

==Early life and education==
Elizabeth Cabot Cary was born on December 5, 1822, into a Boston Brahmin family of New England ancestry. She was born at the house of her grandfather, Thomas Handasyd Perkins, on Pearl Street in Boston, Massachusetts. Her parents were Mary Ann Cushing Perkins Cary and Thomas Graves Cary (who had graduated from Harvard University in 1811).

The Cary and Perkins families were from England and came to Massachusetts during the seventeenth century. Elizabeth Cary was the second of five daughters and seven children and was referred to as &quot;Lizzie&quot; by her immediate family and close friends. Because of her fragile health, she was tutored at home in Temple Place, Boston, which included the study of languages, drawing, music, and reading. She additionally received informal history lessons from Elizabeth Peabody.

==Career==

Agassiz traveled with her husband, Louis Agassiz, and their family to Charleston, South Carolina for his professorship in the medical school throughout the winters of 1851–1852 and 1852–1853. She visited Europe with him in 1859. She worked closely with her husband in his scientific research. Specifically, she accompanied him as the main writer and record keeper for the Thayer Expedition to Brazil, from April 1865 to August 1866, and the Hassler Expedition through the Strait of Magellan, from December 1871 to August 1872.

In 1856, in their home in Cambridge, Agassiz founded a school for girls from Boston. Her husband supported her by giving courses as well as arranging for courses from other Harvard professors. After the closure of the school in 1863 she helped organize and manage the Thayer Expedition with her husband, who she accompanied to Brazil (1865–1866). This expedition, occurring from 1865 to 1866, took place at the end of the American Civil War, its maiden voyage from New York to Rio de Janeiro beginning in the war&#x27;s final week. In 1867, she began a correspondence with Arnold Guyot, a geologist and meteorologist. She also helped organize and manage the next expedition (the Hassler Expedition in 1871–1872), which was the first important marine exploration by the United States government, and made transcripts. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1873, she published several books on natural history for which she had conducted research for many years.

Agassiz contributed to the founding of the coeducational Anderson School of Natural History. In 1869, she became one of the first women members of the American Philosophical Society (with Mary Fairfax Somerville and Maria Mitchell); she became a member on October 15.

===Society for the Private Collegiate Instruction for Women===
In 1879, Agassiz was one of seven female managing directors of the Society for the Private Collegiate Instruction for Women (Harvard Annex). This provided qualified women who intended to pursue an advancement in their education in Cambridge with the opportunity to have private tuition from professors at Harvard College.

Agassiz was essential in ensuring that the &quot;Harvard Annex&quot; for women&#x27;s education was transformed in 1894 from Harvard University into Radcliffe College. From 1894 to 1900, this college was under their direction and from 1900 to 1903 she was honorary president. With her tact and her fundraising skills she promoted the college and contributed significantly to its continuity.

Agassiz became a member of the Ladies&#x27; Visiting Committee for the Kindergarten for the Blind, under the Perkins Institution for the Blind. She acted as treasurer for the Cambridge branch of the committee until an illness in 1904.

=== Research and published works ===
Agassiz&#x27;s research can be studied through her published books in addition to her series of diary entries depicting her global ventures. Her publications include &quot;A First Lesson in Natural History&quot; (1859) and &quot;Seaside Studies in Natural History&quot; (1865), in which she was assisted by her stepson, Alexander Emanuel Agassiz. Elizabeth Agassiz originally published &quot;A First Lesson&quot; under the pseudonym Actaea. Additionally, Elizabeth Agassiz co-authored &quot;A Journey in Brazil&quot; (1868) and edited and published &quot;Louis Agassiz: His Life and Correspondence&quot; in 1885. A biography of Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz was later written by her sister, Emma F. Cary, and Lucy Allen Paton, published in the spring of 1917 with the assistance of the Council of Radcliffe College.

== Personal life ==

Following the marriage of her older sister Mary to Harvard Professor Cornelius Conway Felton (later president of Harvard University), Agassiz began socializing with a group of intellectuals in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1846, she met scientist Louis Agassiz at a dinner with Mary and her husband. Though they wanted to marry, he was married, with three children (Pauline, Ida and Alexander) in Switzerland. His wife had died in 1848. In December 1849 — when it became more socially acceptable for the couple to wed — Lizzie&#x27;s father gave his blessing in support of their marriage. They married on April 25, 1850, in Boston, Massachusetts at King&#x27;s Chapel. Agassiz organized the household and took care of the finances and the children. She developed strong relationships with her stepchildren, Alexander, Ida, and Pauline, and her grandchildren. She had no children of her own.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1873, Agassiz continued to devote time to her work and family. She continued to enjoy traveling, and in 1892, Agassiz ventured with family to the Pacific Coast, specifically California, for three months.

Agassiz died on June 27, 1907, in Arlington, Massachusetts of a cerebral hemorrhage. She is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery with her husband. The monument is a boulder selected from the moraine of the Aar Glaciers, near where Agassiz once lived.

<text>The National Map is a collaborative effort of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and other federal, state, and local agencies to improve and deliver topographic information for the United States. The purpose of the effort is to provide &quot;...a seamless, continuously maintained set of public domain geographic base information that will serve as a foundation for integrating, sharing, and using other data easily and consistently&quot;.

&quot;The National Map&quot; is part of the USGS National Geospatial Program. The geographic information available includes orthoimagery (aerial photographs), elevation, geographic names, hydrography, boundaries, transportation, structures and land cover. &quot;The National Map&quot; is accessible via the Web, as products and services, and as downloadable data. Its uses range from recreation to scientific analysis to emergency response.

&quot;The National Map&quot; is a significant contribution to the U.S. National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) from the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and currently is being transformed to better serve the geospatial community by providing high quality, integrated geospatial data and improved products and services including new generation digital topographic maps. In addition, the National Map is foundational to implementation of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Geospatial Modernization Blueprint.

The USGS also utilizes data from &quot;The National Map&quot; Corps, which consists of volunteers who devote some of their time to provide cartographic information on structures.

&quot;The National Map&quot; is the official replacement for the USGS topographic map program.

==&quot;The National Map&quot; Corps==
&quot;The National Map&quot; Corps consists of volunteers who devote some of their time to provide cartographic information to the U.S. Geological Survey. The only requirements to participate are having access to the Internet and a current familiarity with the area being mapped. This data is used to update &quot;The National Map&quot;.

The program originally allowed volunteers to collect geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) via GPS receivers. The data was entered in spreadsheet format or in ESRI shapefiles and submitted via e-mail to the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center(s) in Denver, Colorado, and Rolla, Missouri. During the registration process, prospective volunteers submitted a list of the 7.5 minute quadrangle maps on which they wished to work. Once accepted into the project, volunteers received their assignment and 1:24,000 scale topographic map of their quad. While there was no deadline for completing maps, the project&#x27;s administrators preferred volunteers to submit coordinates for all structures in the quad no more than one year after beginning work.

In December 2006, a new Internet-based method for submitting information on structures was introduced. Using a web browser, volunteers are able to navigate maps and aerial photography, placing a point on the map and subsequently entering the name and type of structure.

From August 2008, the program stopped accepting structure data collected via GPS, but continued to use the web-based collection site.

===Types of structures mapped===
The following is a list of structures that can be entered on the web site. The focus is significant man-made structures. The &quot;other&quot; category is for man-made structures not on this list and should not include locations such as homes, restaurants or other commercial establishments.

<doc id="1256415" wikidata="Q4796675" url="?curid=1256415" title="Art Agnos">
<text>Arthur Christ Agnos (born Arthouros Agnos; September 1, 1938) is an American politician. He served as the 39th mayor of San Francisco, California from 1988 to 1992 and as the Regional Head of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1993 to 2001.

== Early life ==
Agnos was born Arthouros Agnos in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bates College and a Master of Social Work from Florida State University. He moved to San Francisco in 1966 and went to work at the San Francisco Housing Authority as a social worker with senior populations.

== Early political career ==
Agnos was asked by California State Assemblyman Leo McCarthy to join his staff in January 1968. McCarthy was elected Speaker of the Assembly in 1974 and Agnos became his Chief of Staff. During this period, Agnos helped obtain the first California state funding for community-based mental-health services serving the lesbian and gay community, helped pass nursing-home reform, and worked for preservation of farm land.

In 1976, Agnos was elected to the California State Assembly, defeating Harvey Milk in the Democratic primary in the 16th District, which at the time covered the eastern neighborhoods of San Francisco. He served as the Chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee and as chair of the health subcommittee of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. Agnos also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on South East Asian Refugees.

Agnos authored legislation that received national attention for innovative approaches to challenges in health care, welfare, and civil rights, among other areas. He authored California&#x27;s model welfare reform, GAIN, that matched work requirements with funding for job training, education, and child care. Agnos also authored much of California&#x27;s response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, working directly with President Reagan&#x27;s Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, M.D., and the President of the National Academy of Sciences, David Baltimore, Ph.D.

Although Agnos arranged for the nation&#x27;s first Joint Legislative Session on the AIDS/HIV epidemic with Koop and Baltimore, the comprehensive approach to the epidemic failed to muster a majority of votes when the governor failed to support the measure.

Since then, nearly all aspects of Agnos&#x27; proposals have become law and policy in California. Agnos also authored laws that provide support for family caregivers, fair child-support payments with a calculation that remains known as the Agnos calculator, safeguards against brain damage in the boxing ring, and legislation to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.

===Assassination attempt===
On December 13, 1973, Agnos, who was then a member of the California Commission on Aging, was attending a meeting in the largely black public housing project in the San Francisco neighborhood of Potrero Hill, to discuss building a publicly funded health clinic in the area. After the meeting concluded, he was shot twice in the chest at point-blank range. His life was saved only by the downward trajectory of the bullets. By his own account, he lost a year of his life to recuperation. This was one attack of the Zebra murders and attempted murders in the city from October 1973 to April 1974. The 15 known killings and attempted murders were perpetrated by an offshoot group of the Nation of Islam, a black separatist organization, in which &quot;points&quot; were earned by killing a white person. Four of the killers were convicted of murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three had died by July 1, 2021.

== Mayor of San Francisco ==
In 1987, Agnos ran for mayor to replace Dianne Feinstein, who was term-limited. Agnos came from behind to defeat Supervisor John Molinari, garnering 70 percent of the vote. Agnos took San Francisco in a different direction, agreeing to a consent decree opposed by Feinstein that opened the way for hiring and promotion of African-Americans and women in the fire department. He changed the priorities for the Redevelopment Commission from creating economic and business opportunities to focus on housing, resulting in the largest increase in affordable housing in twenty years. He disbanded the police unit that had engaged in spying on demonstrations. He empowered the Commission on the Status of Women with subpoena powers and independence and named more minorities and lesbians and gay men to top city commissions and department directors than ever before. He was the first mayor to ride in the annual LGBT Freedom Parade. During his term, the city won top bond ratings, ended deficit spending, and endorsed comparable worth and domestic partners, including health insurance for city workers. Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, Agnos refused to move homeless people forced from shelters until new housing was available, which led to a nine-month presence in Civic Center, changing the earlier policy of simply moving homeless from one place to another. In 1991, Agnos lost his re-election bid to the former police chief who promised to put the city &quot;back on track&quot; and who was strongly supported by the firefighters and others opposed to Agnos&#x27;s policy initiatives.

Agnos&#x27; liberalism also ran counter to other conservative interests. As mayor, Agnos and his family became the first to ride in the Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Parade, appointed minorities, lesbians and gays to high city posts, and ended the city&#x27;s opposition to a court-ordered consent decree to hire and promote minorities and women in the fire department which a federal judge opined was &quot;out of control&quot; due to racism when Agnos took office. Agnos ended a police department policy seen as permitting spying on local political organizations and ended the Department&#x27;s Tactical Squad that critics blamed for abusing citizens. Agnos also strengthened civilian oversight of the Police Department.

Agnos is best known for leading the city through the recovery of the Loma Prieta earthquake, the worst since 1906, and the decision to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway (SR 480), a double-decker freeway along the city&#x27;s Embarcadero that was a wall between the waterfront and the city. His decision was strongly opposed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Chinatown community, who found the freeway a convenience for business purposes, and nearly 25,000 signatures were collected to put a measure on the ballot to repeal the decision to tear down the freeway. Once Agnos obtained federal funding, that opposition melted away. A 6–5 vote at the city&#x27;s Board of Supervisors paved the way to tear down the freeway, which led to the start of a decades-long effort to open up the San Francisco waterfront into what is widely considered one of the best outcomes from the earthquake. However, Agnos&#x27;s 1991 opponent used the decision to play to Chinatown&#x27;s sentiments and indicated he opposed tearing down the freeway. In 1991, Chinatown played a significant role in his failure to win re-election. Agnos lost in a 51.5%–48.5% election by a few thousand votes, almost the same as the Chinatown vote.

In recent years, Agnos&#x27;s decision has been looked to by city leaders and elected officials in Seattle and Toronto, Canada, where Agnos&#x27; Embarcadero result is considered a potential model for replacing elevated freeways in urban areas. Under Agnos, the waterfront transit system gained an uninterrupted streetcar line with historic trolley cars running from Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf in the north to Mission Bay in the south. Agnos added to the waterfront by laying plans for the city&#x27;s first public access pier, Pier 7, to allow pedestrians to walk out into the Bay. Today, San Francisco has dedicated a new public pier, Pier 14, to honor Agnos for his leadership in opening the city&#x27;s waterfront.

Agnos&#x27; San Francisco struggled with homelessness, a challenge that faced a number of cities in the late 1980s. Agnos convened a task force of providers, homeless advocates, city agency representatives and others to develop an approach that hoped to end the reliance on overnight shelters in favor of programs to help homeless individuals and families become self-reliant. The plan, Beyond Shelter, won national recognition and awards.

The 1989 earthquake resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 low-rent housing units, including units housing those recovering from homelessness. Agnos championed changes in earthquake recovery programs from the federal and state government and from the Red Cross that provided funds to build new facilities and housing to implement the Beyond Shelter program and to restore arts programs and facilities. In 1993, the results were named a Finalist in the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.

During the nine months that it took to renovate and open the Beyond Shelter multiservice centers, Agnos allowed homeless individuals to camp in the park in front of City Hall, saying that the alternative was to drive them into neighborhoods and that, as long as they were in front of City Hall, city leaders would be confronted daily with the urgency of the crisis. Critics dubbed the result &quot;Camp Agnos&quot; and called on him to use police force to remove them, which Agnos refused to do.

Agnos remained committed to a program of expanding affordable, low-cost housing in San Francisco. The city increased funding to repair and rehabilitate public housing by 300 percent, changing the vacancy rate from ten percent to one percent. He increased other affordable housing production from 342 units when he took office to 2,240 units, winning San Francisco&#x27;s first national recognition from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for Excellence in Rental Rehabilitation and a Special Achievement Award.

Agnos signed a law establishing domestic partner recognition for lesbian and gay couples that had been vetoed by his predecessor, which then became a target of repeal efforts. In 1989, voters narrowly repealed domestic partner recognition. Agnos moved forward with a Family Policy Task Force that recommended broad changes to San Francisco policy and law, including health insurance for domestic partners of city workers. In 1991, the city formally adopted domestic partner health insurance rights for the city&#x27;s 20,000 employees, the largest employer to do so at that time. In 1991, San Francisco voters approved a new domestic partners recognition law for the city.

Agnos served as Chair of the US Conference of Mayors AIDS Task Force, where he organized the lobbying effort that resulted in passage of the Ryan White Care bill. He implemented the policies he advocated as a state legislator, including a 98 percent increase in the city&#x27;s AIDS budget. He created the Mayors Task Force on the AIDS/HIV Epidemic staffed by Dr. Don Francis, a national leader on AIDS/HIV and credited with leading the effort to eradicate smallpox worldwide.

During his tenure, Agnos also undertook major improvements to the city&#x27;s infrastructure. As first lady of San Francisco, Agnos&#x27;s wife Sherry co-chaired the bond campaigns for public school renovations and a new Main Library at Civic Center, and Agnos designated that the existing Main Library become the new home for the Asian Art Museum that had been in Golden Gate Park. Agnos ended the nation&#x27;s longest stalled public works project at Yerba Buena to develop a cultural hub that includes the Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Center, and Yerba Buena Gardens. Agnos also proposed a waterfront site for a new San Francisco Giants ballpark, but the proposal narrowly lost in November 1989 weeks after the Loma Prieta earthquake absorbed public attention. Later the Giants ballpark was sited at the location Agnos designated and built to the same overall design by the architects and developers he selected originally.

== Post-mayoral career ==
During the Clinton administration, Agnos served as Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for California, Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii. Agnos also served as Acting FHA Commissioner and Acting Assistant Secretary for Housing, as well as Director of the Special Actions Office.

Agnos led HUD&#x27;s effort to uplift San Francisco&#x27;s Visitacion Valley, blighted by twin 20-story high-rises supported by HUD and which were unsafe for the residents and the community. Agnos created a partnership with the city, the residents, local community leaders, and HUD that led to the demolishing of Geneva Towers in 1998 and a new resident-led housing development of townhouses and apartments.

Agnos also crafted a HUD partnership for teacher housing in San Francisco and communities with excess land set aside for schools. Under the program, HUD financing supported construction and rental assistance for housing dedicated for teachers. San Jose, California, has a similar program now in effect.

Agnos worked with city leaders throughout the region to create the first funding for homeless coordination between neighboring cities to address concerns that services were not well matched with those in need.

Agnos also led an effort to combat predatory lending aimed at minority homeowners and to repeal &quot;racial covenants&quot; barring non-whites from living or staying overnight in many California communities.

Agnos worked with his mentor former California Assembly Speaker and Lt. Governor Leo T. McCarthy to establish the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco. He has frequently been called upon by the US State Department, the National Democratic Institute, the Asia Foundation, and other international bodies to provide leadership development on democracy building, including in the Russian Far East, the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Zaire, Sierra Leone, Angola, Korea, and as one of the first officials to arrive in Bethlehem to offer disaster assistance after the Israeli army siege of the Church of the Nativity ended on May 10, 2002. He also is frequently sought as a speaker on disaster preparedness and recovery.

In 2007, Agnos was appointed as receiver for the troubled San Francisco Housing Authority. The Housing Authority sued to block the court order, and the matter went before the California Court of Appeals. The city still failed to act for two years, while appealing Agnos&#x27; appointment. By April 2009, the SF &quot;Chronicle&quot; reported that continued inaction while Agnos&#x27; appointment remained in court &quot;seemed to jolt City Hall into action. Agnos never took control of the agency; instead, Fortner resigned under pressure from Newsom, who appointed Mirian Saez, director of operations at Treasure Island, to run the agency on an interim basis before hiring Alvarez. Under Saez and then Alvarez, the agency sold off properties to satisfy the judgments.&quot;

Agnos&#x27; most recent projects also include advising the founders of Open House, the first senior housing planned for elderly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in San Francisco as well as a project working with young families seeking to improve neighborhood schools in their neighborhood of Potrero Hill in San Francisco, and he has worked as a consultant with Minnesota-based Cargill and Arizona-based DMB Associates on their controversial plan to develop a bay salt pond in Redwood City.

Agnos has become involved with restricting the building of new housing in San Francisco. He strongly opposed the 8 Washington condominium project in 2013, in support of &quot;No Wall on the Waterfront&quot;. Agnos also was a prominent advocate for Proposition B, a precedent-setting measure approved by a wide margin by voters in June 2014 that required developments along the waterfront to win voter approval if the plan called for a height that exceeded the height limits established in the Waterfront Land Use plan first approved by voters in 1990 and implemented in 1997. He is also involved with attempts to block the redevelopment of the San Francisco Flower Mart. In 2024, he supported legislation to restrict new housing development in San Francisco&#x27;s Northern Waterfront.

==Personal life==
&quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called Agnos a &quot;longtime practical joker&quot;. Agnos is married to Sherry Hankins and has two sons.

<text>Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary (WLS) is a post-secondary school that trains men to become pastors for the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). It is located in Mequon, Wisconsin.

The campus consists of 22 buildings, including a library that has over 58,000 volumes and a collection of rare pre-18th century theological books.

==History==
Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary has been located in several different places throughout its history.

===Origins in Watertown===
The origins of the school date to 1863, when the main sources of clergy in the Wisconsin Synod were the mission societies in Germany. As the Wisconsin Synod moved to a more conservative and confessional theological stance, the theological character of clergy from the German mission societies came into question. Furthermore, it became more and more difficult to provide pastors in adequate numbers. To alleviate these problems the Wisconsin Synod formed the Theological School of the Wisconsin Synod in Watertown, Wisconsin. The first students met in the professor&#x27;s home. In 1864, the Wisconsin Synod in convention resolved to provide a permanent building for the seminary. of Watertown land were purchased for $600.00. Ground was broken on July 22, 1864, on what is now the campus of Luther Preparatory School. The building was dedicated on September 14, 1865. The third floor of the building was used for the seminary classes, and the first two levels were used for the synod&#x27;s college, Northwestern College.

===Merger with Concordia Seminary===
Because of small enrollments and an increasing desire to enter into fellowship with the Missouri Synod, the school merged with that synod&#x27;s Concordia Seminary in 1870. As part of the merger, it was agreed that the Missouri Synod would actively participate in Northwestern College by providing a professor for the school and assisting the school with financial support. Wisconsin was to send students to St. Louis, provide a professor, and contribute financial support for Concordia. Each synod was to retain management of its own institution. Six Wisconsin Synod students began study in St. Louis in March 1870.

===Reopening in Milwaukee===
In 1878, the WELS reopened a seminary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to help prevent the assimilation of the entire synod into the Missouri Synod. Wisconsin Synod leaders stressed that doctrinal fellowship was possible with the Missouri Synod without organizational unity. Two small houses were rented at the corner of Hubbard Street and Garfield Avenue and served as the school&#x27;s campus for two years. Prof. Eugen Notz also served as the pastor of St. Marcus Lutheran Church a block away.

The school quickly outgrew that limited capacity. The seminary board authorized the purchase of a small nearby park at 13th and Vine streets to serve as the new campus. The park pavilion was remodeled into classrooms and a residence for Prof. Notz. Classes there began in 1880.

===Move to Wauwatosa===
Because the increasing number of seminarians outgrew the 13th Street facility, a new seminary campus was opened in 1893 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, with 31 students. The facility was a two-story building with a full basement and a large attic. The first floor held two classrooms, a chapel, a faculty lounge, several study rooms, and a restroom in each of the two wings. The second floor mirrored the layout of the first floor, with a large hall in the center. This space was later occupied by the library. The basement contained a kitchen and dining area, a washroom, and a recreation room. Years later, the attic was finished and outfitted for additional student quarters.

===Permanent campus in Mequon===
As enrollment at Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary continued to increase, synod and seminary administrators realized that a bigger facility would become necessary in the coming years. The synod purchased an farm in present-day Mequon near the village of Thiensville for $25,000. Seminary professor John Philip Koehler was given charge of the general design, incorporating the style and features of the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach, Germany.

Ground was broken for construction in 1928, and the cornerstone was laid that same year. The process of moving to the new campus began in the summer of 1929 and the first classes were held in the autumn semester of 1929.

==Campus==
The Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary campus is situated on in Mequon, Wisconsin. With large trees, expansive grassy fields, woods, a stream, and a small holding pond, the campus resembles a park.

===Architectural features===
The design of the campus mimics the architectural style of the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach, Germany. Features include stone walls and slate roofs. The overall layout of the dormitory and academic center is a ring, creating a courtyard in the center of the main complex. &quot;Fachwerk&quot;, timber-framed brick walls, are also common on the campus.

===Buildings===
The seminary tower acts as a gateway to a central courtyard and divides the main building into two areas: the residence hall and dining hall lie to the west and administration-classroom building, chapel, and library to the east. The residence hall, consisting of eight units, can accommodate about 80 students. The dining hall seats approximately 150. Between 1997 and 2002, the residence hall was expanded to provide more room for each student. The classrooms were simultaneously remodeled to provide current technology. An auditorium-gymnasium, built in 1986, seats 1,200.

The campus features these main buildings and areas:
*Administration-Classroom
*Chapel
*Library
*Residence and Dining Hall
*Gymnasium

===Gymnasium===
Opened in 1986, the gymnasium seats 1,200. The main gymnasium contains two basketball courts and a volleyball court. The building also has a racquetball court, two locker rooms, and an exercise/weight room. The gymnasium is also used for concerts, holiday services, and graduations.

===Chapel===
Included in the 1929 building project was a chapel for campus worship. The original chapel was quite plain and did not contain any pews, musical instruments, art glass windows, or even a pulpit and altar. It was not until the 1930s that the chancel was decorated with the help of a local craftsman. For decades the chapel featured a small wooden altar, a pulpit, a lectern, wooden pews, tile floors, a Wick&#x27;s organ, and three art glass windows behind the altar. Unfortunately, the low ceiling and small amount of natural light detracted greatly from the atmosphere.

====Renovation====
In 2002, the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary facilities committee presented a study on the chapel, noting the surface deficiencies of the chapel and pointing out that the chapel architecture did not promote by example the type of liturgical worship practices currently taught at the seminary and commonly in practice among WELS congregations. The committee proposed a chapel renovation.

The renovation, funded primarily by special gifts, began in 2004 and took a full year to complete. Construction was completed in May, 2005. A dedication service was not held until the beginning of the following academic year, on August 29, 2005.

The new chapel design features large, clear windows to allow natural light to pour into the room. The windows are etched with symbols representing the four theological disciplines. The ceiling is now opened up to the tall gable roof. Dark stone tile floors contrast with the white paint on the walls and ceiling. Other features of the chapel include:

* Ambo - The ambo replaces pulpit and lectern as one central location for the reading of Scripture.
* Paschal candle - The Paschal candle reminds worshippers of Christ the lamb who was sacrificed for sin.
* Font - The baptismal font reminds worshippers of their own baptisms. The design allows for a constant flow of water that adds a gentle sound to the chapel.
* Freestanding altar - The altar and chairs are all freestanding and can be moved as needed. In practice, the chapel layout has remained the same since its dedication.
In May, 2006, the newly renovated chapel received a merit award from the American Institute of Architects Wisconsin chapter.

===Library===
The Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary library houses over 58,000 books, almost all on the subject of theology and the Bible. The library subscribes to over 300 periodicals and journals from around the world, most of which are theological in nature. The library contains more than 2000 rare books, some from as early as 1500. Several examples are on display on the main level on the library. Other features of the library include a World Mission Collection, with mission materials printed in over 30 different languages. The library also maintains a vertical file of over 3000 essays written by Wisconsin Synod pastors and professors, many of which can be accessed on the library&#x27;s essay file website.

<text>Mervyn John Meggitt (20 August 1924 – 13 November 2004 New York State) was an Australian anthropologist and one of the pioneering researchers of highland Papua New Guinea and of Indigenous Australian cultures.

== Early life ==
Born in Warwick, Queensland and educated at the Anglican Church Grammar School (formerly the Church of England Grammar School) in Brisbane, Meggitt served in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War. Following demobilisation, he studied psychology and anthropology at the University of Sydney, and between 1953 and 1979, on the suggestion of A. P. Elkin, he carried out research amongst the Warlpiri (Walbiri) of Central Australia and the people of Engan Province, Papua New Guinea.

== Teaching ==
Throughout the 1950s he was a lecturer in anthropology at Sydney, but in the 1960s he took up a position as a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York. His works include &quot;The Lineage System of the Mae Engan&quot; and &quot;Desert People: A Study of the Walbiri Aborigines of Australia&quot;. But perhaps his most noted work is &quot;Blood is Their Argument,&quot; an intensive analysis of the warfare habits of the Engan tribes. The book is widely considered to be among the first ethnographic studies of warfare.

In his work on the people of Enga in Papua New Guinea Meggitt found a firmly patrilineal system. This was unusual as compared to other highland groups, which tended to be organized on a basis of residence as well as descent. Restudies of his material as well the Engan suggest that Meggitt overstated the case, and the Engan may be more like other highland groups than was thought in previous decades.

<text>&quot;The Red Queen&#x27;s Race&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov; it uses the Red Queen&#x27;s race from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; as a metaphor for the final plot twist. The story also makes reference to Asimov&#x27;s psychohistory. &quot;The Red Queen&#x27;s Race&quot; was first published in the January 1949 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and reprinted in the 1972 collection &quot;The Early Asimov&quot;.

&quot;The Red Queen&#x27;s Race&quot; was written in July 1948, a month after Asimov received a PhD from Columbia University and became a postdoc studying anti-malarial drugs.

==Plot summary==
The story is told by an unnamed narrator, an agent of an unnamed U.S. intelligence bureau. The agent is tasked with an investigation into an atomic power plant which has been completely drained of power. A Professor of Nuclear Physics, Elmer Tywood, is found dead.

As the investigation progresses, bringing in Tywood&#x27;s research students and his university colleagues, it is revealed that Tywood had developed a means to send objects back in time via &quot;micro-temporal translation.&quot; His plan was to &quot;improve&quot; the world by giving Hellenic Greece advanced knowledge in the form of chemistry.

The investigating agents and their superior, The Boss, gradually realize that the changes introduced into history might, through the butterfly effect, cause the deletion from existence of every human being alive.

The trail eventually leads to the doorstep of Mycroft James Boulder, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, who had been hired by Tywood to translate a textbook of chemistry into Attic Greek. He states that he had figured out Tywood&#x27;s plan and translated only enough to coincide with historical accounts.

With no clear solution, the investigation is shelved and filed under the heading of &quot;?&quot;.

<doc id="1256432" wikidata="Q862186" url="?curid=1256432" title="Bill Haslam">
<text>William Edward Haslam (; born August 23, 1958) is an American billionaire businessman and politician who served as the 49th governor of Tennessee from 2011 to 2019. A member of the Republican Party, Haslam previously served as the 67th mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee.

He was born in Knoxville and graduated from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He began his career in business, joining his father, Jim Haslam, who was the founder of Pilot Corporation. Haslam rose to president of Pilot Corp in the 1990s, after his brother Jimmy Haslam became the company&#x27;s CEO. Haslam then left Pilot and from 1999 to 2001 was the CEO of the e-commerce and cataloging division at the department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue. He then became a consultant at Saks and later served on the board of directors at Harold&#x27;s Stores, Inc. He is a co-owner of a minor league baseball team, the Tennessee Smokies, and is set to become majority owner of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Nashville Predators by 2025.

He was elected Mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee in the 2003 Knoxville mayoral election with 52% of the vote. He was reelected in the 2007 Knoxville mayoral election, winning 87% of the vote, and served until 2011. After incumbent Governor Phil Bredesen was term-limited, Haslam declared his candidacy for the office in January 2009. He defeated U.S. Representative Zach Wamp and Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey in the Republican primary with 47% of the vote and went on to defeat Democratic businessman Mike McWherter with 65% of the vote in the 2010 general election.

A 2015 &quot;Forbes&quot; article estimated Haslam&#x27;s net worth at $2 billion, making him the nation&#x27;s wealthiest elected official at that time. He was the wealthiest state governor in America, until Democrat J. B. Pritzker of Illinois took office in January 2019.

In the fall of 2019, Haslam became a visiting professor of political science at Vanderbilt University.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Haslam was born in 1958 in Knoxville, Tennessee, the third child of Jim Haslam, the founder of Pilot Corporation, the parent company of the convenience store and travel center chain, Pilot Flying J, and his wife, Cynthia (Allen). Jim Haslam has been a Republican Party fundraiser and University of Tennessee donor and trustee for several decades.

Haslam was educated at the Webb School of Knoxville, where he became active in the Christian group Young Life. He later attended Emory University, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1980. He is a member of the Beta Chi chapter of the Sigma Chi International Fraternity.

As a teenager, Haslam began working part-time in his father&#x27;s corporation. He had made plans to teach history and eventually become a minister. Following his university graduation, he returned to Knoxville to work for Pilot in hopes of learning more about the business world before entering the seminary, and eventually decided to stay with the company. He was elevated to president of the company (with his brother, Jimmy, as CEO, and father as chairman) in 1995.

In 1999, Haslam joined Saks Fifth Avenue as the chief executive officer of the e-commerce and catalog division. He left Saks in 2001, and joined the board of the Dallas-based clothing chain, Harold&#x27;s Stores Inc., later that year.

Haslam is one of the owners of the Tennessee Smokies, a minor league baseball team in East Tennessee. His brother, current Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam, became majority owner of the Cleveland Browns in 2012.

==Mayor of Knoxville==
In 2002, Haslam announced he was running for Mayor of Knoxville, inspired in part by a conversation he had had with then-Chattanooga mayor (and later United States Senator) Bob Corker. Knoxville&#x27;s mayoral elections are nominally non-partisan, but Haslam was known to be a member of the Republican Party when he ran for the office. His opponent in the race, Knox County commissioner Madeline Rogero, criticized Haslam as an oil company puppet, and blamed his father for the appointment of controversial University of Tennessee president John Shumaker, an attack Haslam dismissed as &quot;petty, personal politics&quot;. On September 30, 2003, he defeated Rogero by a 52% to 46% margin. He was sworn in in December 2003.

In 2006, Haslam appointed Rogero director of community development, later stating he had read Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x27;s &quot;Team of Rivals&quot;, and was inspired by President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s decision to appoint former campaign rivals to his cabinet. He was reelected in 2007, winning 87% of the vote against challengers Isa Infante and Mark Saroff.

Haslam identifies several successful historic preservation initiatives among his accomplishments as mayor, including saving the historic S&amp;W Cafeteria in downtown Knoxville, building a new cinema (the Regal Riviera) in the city&#x27;s downtown, and revitalizing the historic Bijou Theatre. In 2008, he was appointed to a four-year term on the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation by U.S. President George W. Bush.

Along with historical preservation efforts, Haslam helped spur residential and retail growth in the downtown area, mainly by offering developers tax subsidies. He helped implement a master plan for the development of the South Knoxville riverfront, which was given an Outstanding Planning Award by the Tennessee Chapter of the American Planning Association. The Haslam administration operated under a balanced budget policy, which helped to double the city&#x27;s savings during his first term.

==Gubernatorial elections==

===Elections===

====2010====

On January 6, 2009, Haslam declared his intention to run for Tennessee governor in 2010.

His campaign received contributions of $3.9 million between January and July 1 in 2009, substantially more than his Republican primary rivals. Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey received $1.3 million and U.S. Congressman Zach Wamp received $1.2 million, while Shelby County District Attorney General Bill Gibbons reported $416,000 at that time. Among Democratic candidates, businessman Mike McWherter raised $650,000 at the mid-year, followed by former State House Majority Leader Kim McMillan&#x27;s $180,000.
Haslam received endorsements from former U.S. Senator Howard Baker and Congressman Jimmy Duncan. &quot;The Tennessean&quot; wrote, &quot;Haslam appears most likely to be able to ride Gov. Phil Bredesen&#x27;s pro-business coattails, despite the different party affiliation.&quot;&quot;

On the Republican side from July 1, 2009, until January 15, 2010, Haslam collected $1.8 million, Ramsey raised $1,412,593 including a $200,000 loan, Wamp raised $1,373,078 including a $61,000 loan, and Gibbons raised $225,218. Among Democrats during the six months, State Senate Minority Leader Jim Kyle collected $741,485 including a $300,000 personal loan, McWherter raised $402,868, and McMillan raised $159,981.

Haslam campaigned on his executive experience as both Knoxville&#x27;s mayor and the president of a major company. His opponents attacked him as an oil executive, especially in the wake of price-gouging allegations levied against Pilot in the wake of the post-Hurricane Katrina fuel shortages, and criticized his refusal to release information related to his income while at Pilot.

On August 5, 2010, Haslam won in the Republican primary for governor with almost 48% of the vote, compared to 29% for Wamp and 22% for Ramsey. Mike McWherter, son of former Governor Ned McWherter, was nominated by the Democrats after several well-known elected officials declined the candidacy.

On November 2, 2010, Haslam won the gubernatorial election over Democratic candidate Mike McWherter, taking 65% of the vote to McWherter&#x27;s 35%. The Republicans also increased their majorities in both chambers of the state legislature, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1869.

====2014====
Haslam announced he would run for re-election in 2014. He defeated three other candidates in the Republican primary with 88% of the vote.

In the general election on November 4, 2014, Haslam defeated Democratic nominee Charles Brown with over 70% of the vote and won every county.

==Tenure as governor==

=== 2011 ===
Haslam stated that job creation and long-term economic growth were his top priority as governor, followed by education reform and workforce development. On June 16, 2011, Haslam signed a $30.8 billion state budget, a 3.9% decrease from the previous year&#x27;s budget.

The budget included 1.6% pay raise for state employees (though it also called for over 1,300 positions to be cut), grants to facilitate construction of an Electrolux plant near Memphis and a Wacker Chemie plant near Cleveland, and $10 million for the Memphis Research Consortium. The budget bill also contained an amendment cutting off all state funding to Planned Parenthood, but the measure was negated by an amendment inserted into the same bill by an unknown legislator, something Haslam vowed to correct in 2012.

On May 23, 2011, Haslam signed a bill overturning a Nashville ordinance that barred discrimination against the hiring of homosexuals for any companies awarded city contracts. On June 1, Haslam signed a bill requiring voters to present photo identification at polling places, a measure supporters argue prevents voter fraud, but detractors have derided as an attempt to disenfranchise traditionally-Democratic voting blocs. On June 2, Haslam signed a bill replacing public school teachers&#x27; collective bargaining rights with a process called &quot;collaborative conferencing&quot;, effectively bypassing the teachers&#x27; union, the Tennessee Education Association.

Other legislation signed by Haslam included a tort reform measure that limits non-economic damages in civil suits, a bill that lifted the cap on the number charter schools in the state and opened enrollment in charter schools to more students, and a bill that allows college students to use Hope Scholarship funds during summer semesters.

In October 2011, Haslam approved an order to implement a curfew on Legislative Plaza in downtown Nashville, where several hundred protesters with the Occupy Nashville movement (part of the greater Occupy Wall Street movement) were camping out. In the early morning hours of October 28, 29 protesters were arrested when they refused to comply with the order, and on the following day, 26 were arrested. In both cases, the arrests were thrown out by General Sessions Night Court Commissioner Tom Nelson, who ruled that the state had no authority to set a curfew for Legislative Plaza. Haslam stated the curfew was necessary due to deteriorating sanitary conditions and safety issues on the Plaza, though critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit in federal court on October 31 to halt the arrests, have stated that the curfew is a violation of the protesters&#x27; civil rights.

=== 2012 ===
The $31 billion budget bill signed by Haslam for 2012 included $50 million in tax cuts, $560 million for construction projects, a 2.5% pay raise for state employees, and additional funding to offset anticipated tuition hikes at state colleges. In June, Haslam signed bills that eliminated the state&#x27;s gift tax and reduced the state&#x27;s inheritance tax and the sales tax on groceries. He also signed the &quot;Fast Track&quot; bill, which provided cash grants to companies seeking to expand or relocate to Tennessee.

Tennessee was granted a waiver requested by Haslam from certain portions of the federal government&#x27;s No Child Left Behind standards. Haslam argued that the law&#x27;s Adequate Yearly Progress model labelled some state schools as failures in spite of these schools having made substantial improvement. In May, he signed a bill providing $37 million in grants for state schools. In July, Haslam called for an overhaul of the state&#x27;s higher education system, with the intention of generating a higher number of college graduates in high-paying fields.

In March 2012, the legislature passed a bill protecting teachers who challenged scientific theories such as the theory of evolution and global warming in the classroom. Critics assailed the measure as a &quot;monkey bill&quot; that was little more than an attempt to allow creationism to be taught in science classes. While Haslam refused to sign the bill, he also refused to veto it, effectively allowing it to become law. He criticized the bill for creating confusion rather than clarity, but pointed out the legislature had passed it by a large margin, and argued the bill would have no effect on the state&#x27;s science curriculum.

On March 8, 2012, Haslam instructed his Health and Wellness Task Force to focus on the state&#x27;s growing obesity problem, noting that nearly one-third of Tennesseans are obese. In early April, he initiated the &quot;Meth Stops Now&quot; campaign, aimed at informing the public of the consequences of methamphetamine manufacture. In May, he signed legislation aimed at curbing prescription drug abuse.

On April 24, 2012, Haslam signed into law the Tennessee Excellence, Accountability and Management (&quot;TEAM&quot;) Act, which established a new hiring system for state agencies and overhauled the evaluation standards for state employees by placing a greater focus on job performance rather than seniority. The bill also makes it easier for executive branch employees to be hired and fired, establishes merit raises for high performing workers, and gives preference to veterans in job openings where applicants have equal qualifications.

In May 2012, Haslam signed a bill barring sex education instructors from encouraging &quot;gateway sexual activity.&quot; Proponents of the bill argued it was necessary to clarify the meaning of abstinence, while opponents argued the bill&#x27;s wording was overly vague, and could be construed to include behavior such as kissing and holding hands. Other bills signed by Haslam in May included a measure requiring drug testing for welfare recipients, a measure providing grants to companies to pay for training expenses for recently laid-off workers, and a bill requiring Amazon.com to start collecting sales taxes on online purchases by 2014.

After the General Assembly permanently adjourned in May, Haslam issued the first veto of his governorship. He vetoed a controversial bill that sought to end Vanderbilt University&#x27;s &quot;All Comers&quot; policy, which required religious groups at the school to allow any student to join even if the student didn&#x27;t share the group&#x27;s religious beliefs. The legislature could not override the veto because it was no longer in session. Haslam stated he disagreed with the policy, but didn&#x27;t think it appropriate for the government to interfere with the policies of a private institution.

In December 2012, Haslam announced the state would not implement a provision of the Affordable Care Act (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) that allows for a state-run health care exchange. Haslam had considered a state-run exchange for several weeks, but argued the federal government had not provided enough information regarding costs of the program, and what had been provided consisted of draft proposals subject to change. &quot;More and more I&#x27;m convinced they are making this up as they go,&quot; he said.

=== 2014 ===
In April 2014, Haslam signed into law a measure allowing prosecution of a new mother with criminal assault if she had used narcotics during pregnancy. The law has been criticised as discriminatory against women from poor rural areas with limited access to healthcare and addiction treatment facilities. In July 2014, the first woman prosecuted under this law was arrested in Madisonville, Monroe County.

=== 2016 ===
In April 2016, Haslam vetoed a bill to make the Bible the official book of Tennessee. The bill, sponsored by State Sen. Steve Southerland, R-Morristown, passed in both the State House and the Senate. If signed by Haslam, it would have made Tennessee the first state to make the Bible its state book. Haslam vetoed the bill on April 14, 2016. An attempt to override the veto failed in the State House, garnering 43 votes, short of the threshold of 50 needed to override.

Haslam took part in the 16-member search committee to select a new chancellor for the Tennessee Board of Regents. He continued to take part in restructuring the Board, which included the implementation of the FOCUS Act.

=== 2017 ===
In April 2017, Haslam signed the IMPROVE Act into law. The bill, which stands for &quot;Improving Manufacturing, Public Roads, and Opportunities for a Vibrant Economy,&quot; cut the state sales tax on food from five to four percent, increased the gasoline and diesel fuel taxes by six and ten cents, respectively, raised the tax on natural gas by eight cents, increased vehicle registration fees, and instituted a new $100 annual fee for electric vehicles. Its primary purpose was for TDOT to fund a $10 billion backlog of 962 needed highway projects. A similar plan called the Better Roads Program was initiated by then-governor Lamar Alexander in 1986.

In May 2017, Haslam signed HB 1111/SB 1085 into law. The bill was seen by the Human Rights Campaign as an attempt to challenge &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; and undermine same-sex marriage in Tennessee, and Haslam was criticized by the Tennessee Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Tennessee Equality Project (TEP) for signing it into law.

==Political positions==
===Taxes and budget===
Haslam favors a conservative state budget that keeps taxes low in order to create and maintain a business-friendly environment. While he largely supports budget cuts, Haslam has suggested that the Republican Party is too often focused on scaling back government rather than making it work. &quot;At the end of the day,&quot; he said, &quot;I think the most conservative principle there is, is giving people a dollar worth of value for a dollar worth of tax paid.&quot;

===Gun laws===
Haslam was formerly a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, but he resigned early in 2009 and became a member of the National Rifle Association of America. When a candidate for governor, Haslam said he would sign a constitutional carry bill, but as governor, he opposed constitutional carry.

===Abortion===
Haslam is against abortion.

===Education===
As Governor, Haslam implemented education reform programs that offered tuition-free access to higher education. The Tennessee Promise program, launched in 2014, provides two years of tuition-free access for high school graduates to attend community or technical college. The Tennessee Reconnect program provides tuition-free access for most of the state&#x27;s adults to earn an associate degree or technical certificate. Haslam framed the education reforms as part of economic development, as the state sought to provide its workforce with more skills and thus attract businesses to the state.

===LGBT issues===
Haslam opposes same-sex marriage, though he has stated that he wouldn&#x27;t discriminate against gay employees. In May 2017, he signed a bill requiring the so-called &quot;natural and ordinary meaning&quot; of words in state law and government forms be used unless those words are specifically defined. This law will make it more difficult for same-sex couples to adopt children, pleasing socially conservative groups like the Family Action Council of Tennessee. The latter lobbied heavily for this bill to be passed, in order to ensure Tennessee courts only accept a &#x27;traditional&#x27; definition of family. LGBT organization GLAAD issued a statement that Governor Haslam &quot;has now placed the future of the state’s economy and the well-being of the LGBTQ community in jeopardy.”

===Immigration laws===
Haslam has said he favors cracking down on businesses that employ illegal immigrants, and suggested he would sign a law requiring law enforcement officers to check the citizenship status of arrested individuals they suspect might be in the country illegally, if passed by the state legislature.

===Other===
On January 11, 2012, Bill Haslam endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination in the 2012 United States presidential election. This announcement came on the heels of Romney&#x27;s victory in the New Hampshire primary on January 10. Haslam&#x27;s father was the Tennessee state co-chairman for the Romney campaign.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, Haslam stated that many of the more controversial measures passed by the state legislature, such as the 2012 law protecting teachers who dispute evolution in class, were &quot;frustrating and a distraction.&quot; He noted that in his travels across the state, &quot;those aren&#x27;t the issues I hear people bringing up.&quot;

== Post-governorship ==

After US Senator Lamar Alexander announced that he would not seek re-election in 2020, speculation began to arise that Haslam would run for the seat. Haslam announced in July 2019 that he would not do so.

In June 2022, Bill Haslam agreed to become the new owner of the NHL&#x27;s Nashville Predators &quot;through a multi-phased acquisition transaction&quot;. Haslam, whose brother, Jimmy, co-owns the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns with his wife, Dee, reached an agreement with the franchise&#x27;s present ownership group, which is chaired by Herbert Fritch and includes at least 17 others. He is set to become the majority owner of the Predators by July 1, 2025.

In May 2023, U.S. Senator and 2024 presidential candidate Tim Scott appointed Haslam as national co-chair of his 2024 campaign.

==Personal life==
Haslam met his wife, Crissy Garrett, at Emory University and they have been married since 1981; with one son and two daughters and eight grandchildren. Haslam is a Presbyterian, and is a longtime member of Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, an Evangelical Presbyterian Church congregation in Knoxville. He attends Christ Presbyterian Church when in Nashville. Haslam has been a member of the Young Life Board of Trustees since 2011.

<text>Sporting Club Bastia (, commonly referred to as SC Bastia or simply Bastia) is a French professional football club based in Bastia on the island of Corsica. The club plays in Ligue 2, the second tier of French football, having won the 2020–21 Championnat National. The club plays its home matches at the Stade Armand Cesari located within the city. SC Bastia is known for its strong association with Corsican nationalism.

Bastia&#x27;s main historical success include reaching the final of the 1977–78 edition of the UEFA Cup. The team was defeated by Dutch club PSV Eindhoven (0–0 at home, 0–3 away). Domestically, Bastia won the second division of French football in 1968 and 2012, and the Coupe de France in 1981. During the club&#x27;s infancy, it was league champions of the &quot;Corsican League&quot; 17 times. They are the local rivals of Ajaccio and contest the Derby Corse.

The club has signed several famous players in its history, notably including Dragan Džajić, Claude Papi, Johnny Rep, Roger Milla, Michael Essien, Alex Song, Sébastien Squillaci, Jérôme Rothen, Antar Yahia and Florian Thauvin.

In 2017 the club was relegated to the Championnat National 3 due to financial irregularities and lost its professional licence. &quot;I Turchini&quot; regained professional status in 2021 following promotion to Ligue 2.

== History ==

=== Genesis of the team and beginning of professional football ===

Sporting Club de Bastia was founded in 1905 by a Swiss named Hans Ruesch. He taught German in high school in Bastia. The first president of Bastia was Emile Brandizi. The Corsican club celebrated its debut on the Place d&#x27;Armes of Bastia, in the light of a single gas burner.

The club began its professional journey in 1965, in Division 2. After three successful seasons, it was crowned Champion of France&#x27;s Second Division in 1968, joining the elite. The first season was difficult, but the club still maintained its place. Thus began a decade widely considered the finest in club history. In 1972, the club reached, for the first time, the final of the Coupe de France against Olympique de Marseille (losing 2–1), getting it its first qualification in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which led to elimination against the excellent team of Atlético Madrid.

=== UEFA Cup finalist in 1978 and Cup victory in France in 1981 ===
In 1977, Bastia finished third in the Division 1 with the best offence in the league, with magnificent Dragan Džajić as a left winger
 and qualified for the UEFA Cup.

This is the beginning of the team built around playmaker Claude Papi, which was composed of many talented players such as Johnny Rep of the Netherlands; Jean-François Larios, a midfielder and French international; and Charles Orlanducci, the solid libero nicknamed the &quot;Lion of Vescovato&quot;.

The team eliminated successively Sporting Lisbon, Newcastle United, Torino, Carl Zeiss Jena and Grasshoppers Zurich before a final defeat to PSV Eindhoven (0–0, 0–3). Of all the victories, the 3–2 win in Turin made the most lasting impression, the &quot;Toro&quot; being undefeated for two seasons on their home pitch. It is also during this match that Bastia marks the best goal of that time, a volley from 22 meters by Jean-François Larios.

The final would, however, end with misfortune. First, with a first leg played at Furiani on an unplayable pitch, heavy rain having fallen on Corsica on 26 April 1978. Unfortunately, the Yugoslav referee postponed the meeting because of the proximity to World Cup in Argentina that was scheduled a few weeks later. Despite Bastia&#x27;s dominance, the meeting ended with a goalless draw, 0–0.
The final return, 9 May, lasted only 24 minutes. This is the time it took PSV Eindhoven to score the first goal, followed by two more late in the game (3–0). The townsfolk will attribute the defeat of Bastia to fatigue accumulated in the league (3 games in 6 days in the days before the final return) and also the rain-soaked pitch in the first leg at Furiani.

Bastia then realised the greatest moment in Corsican sport (see the movie Forza Bastia of Jacques Tati). The ECBC club, from a town of only 40,000 souls, had done more than challenge the major capitals of European football: it had allowed the whole of Corsica to meet, at a time when the nationalist movement was born, three years after the episode of Bastia, in 1975.

Three years after that final, the Bastia won its first trophy with the Coupe de France 1980–81. This was a prestigious victory for the Corsican club facing St. Etienne of Michel Platini. The final was played at Parc des Princes in front of more than 46,000 spectators, including the newly elected President of the Republic, François Mitterrand.

=== Descent in Division 2 and Furiani disaster ===

After 18 years in the elite, the club went down to the second division at the end of the 1985–86 season, and stayed for eight years. This era is marked by the catastrophe of Furiani: In the 1991–92 season, the club reached the semi-finals of the Coupe de France. The match was played at Stade Armand Cesari, or &quot;Furiani Stadium&quot;, against Olympique de Marseille which dominated the Championship of France. The enthusiasm was such that was decided to hastily construct a temporary stand of 10,000 seats. The upper part of the platform collapsed a few minutes before kick-off killing 18 and injuring 2,300.

=== Back in Ligue 1 and in the European Cup ===
The club returned to the elite for the 1994–95 season and that year reached the final of the League Cup. This era was marked by the work of Frédéric Antonetti, who coached the club between 1990 and 1994 and oversaw the development of new talents (Morlaye Soumah, Laurent Casanova, and Cyril Rool).

Antonetti coached the first team from 1994 to 2001 (with an interlude in 1998–99) and was involved in the recruitment of players such as Lubomir Moravcik, Pierre-Yves André, Frédéric Née, Franck Jurietti, and Anto Drobnjak, the latter of whom was the club&#x27;s top scorer in his third season. At the end of the 1995–96 season, Drobnjak was also second in the Championship scoring charts with 20 goals, one goal behind top scorer Sonny Anderson.

In the 1996–97 season the club finished in 7th place in Ligue 1, just 3 points off the top, thus qualifying for the Intertoto Cup. The club won the Intertoto Cup, and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the 1997–98 season. Bastia eliminated Benfica in the round of 32 before falling to Steaua Bucharest in the next round. This defeat left a bitter taste due to the domination Bastia had in both matches. The performance of Bastia in the league in the following years allowed it to qualify two more times for the Intertoto Cup, in 1998 and 2001, but failed to re-qualify for the UEFA Cup.

After the departure of Antonetti in 2001, the club would not finish in the top ten again. They did reach the final of the Coupe de France in 2001–02; in their midfield was Michael Essien, who would go on to play for Lyon and Chelsea. Another player groomed by Bastia was defender Alex Song, who later played for Arsenal and Barcelona.

Between 2002 and 2005, Bastia was managed by Robert Nouzaret, Gerard Gili, François Ciccolini, and lastly the duo of Michel Padovani and Eric Durand. Each failed to take the team to the top ten, the final league placing actually falling each year (see Section championship history), despite the first team featuring the likes of Tony Vairelles, Florian Maurice, Franck Silvestre, Lilian Laslandes (all internationals) and Cyril Jeunechamp.

In the winter break of the 2004–05 season, the club fell into the relegation zone. Bastia recruited Christian Karembeu, member of the 1998 World Cup-winning France team, but Bastia would still be relegated to Ligue 2 at the end of the season after 11 consecutive years in Ligue 1.

=== The Descent Below ===
In 2005, the club was relegated to Ligue 2. Five years later, Bastia was in serious danger of descent into the Championnat National. Bastia was officially relegated to the National on 7 May 2010, following a draw (0–0) with Tours at the 37th matchday of Ligue 2.

On 6 July 2010, the club was administratively relegated to Championnat de France amateur by the Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion (DNCG). The club actually had a deficit of €1.2 million, which was filled by grants from local governments (Territorial Community of Corsica, the General Council of Haute-Corse). On 23 July 2010, the Federal Council of the French Football Federation authorised Bastia to play in the 2010–11 season, as requested by the National Olympic Committee and French sports (CNOSF) after the DNCG had refused.

Despite this disrupted pre-season, Bastia performed well in the transfer window, with no fewer than six rookies. As for departures, there is mainly the transfer of Florent Ghisolfi (Reims) and Christophe Gaffory (Vannes) as well as Pierre-Yves André who decided to end his career.

=== The rise in Ligue 2 ===

Faruk Hadžibegić was fired from the managers&#x27; post after poor results, and the job then passed to Frédéric Hantz. On 22 April 2011, Bastia officially earned its place in Ligue 2 after a game against Frejus-Saint Raphael. No fewer than 500 townsfolk had made the trip. On 7 May 2011, Bastia become the National champion, following a victory over Créteil by 2 goals to one, with Bastia finishing with a record tally of 91 points and unbeaten at home throughout the campaign. Sporting was leading at the half, but equalised by David Suarez, then Idrissa Sylla allowed Bastia to take the lead in the 92nd minute in a crazy atmosphere. At the end of the match, the pitch at Armand Cesari was invaded by Bastia fans, happy to celebrate with their players and their coach, Frédéric Hantz, this new title.

=== Return to Ligue 1 ===

Bastia, newly promoted from the National, welcomed Jérôme Rothen, Toifilou Maoulida, François Marque, Ludovic Genest and Florian Thauvin into the club. Bastia started off on a good note, falling off slightly in the autumn. From early February until the beginning of April, Bastia did not lose a single match. On 23 April 2012, in a full Stadium Armand Cesari, Bastia virtually secured their place amongst the elite by winning against Châteauroux (2–1). On 1 May 2012, Bastia became champion of Ligue 2, 44 years after its first and only league title, with their victory over Metz at Armand Cesari. On 11 May 2012, Bastia won its last game of the season at home 2–1 against Nantes thanks to goals from Jérôme Rothen and David Suarez. The club was also on a 2-year run of being undefeated at home. Bastia became part of the very exclusive club of teams undefeated at home in Europe. Several players played their last game against Nantes in the colours of Bastia, including David Suarez and Jacques-Désiré Périatambée.

Bastia won all the trophies UNFP for Ligue 2: Jérôme Rothen, best player; Macedo Novaes, best goalkeeper; and Frédéric Hantz, best coach, who placed five players in the team line-up (Macedo Novaes, Féthi Harek, Wahbi Khazri, Sadio Diallo and Jérôme Rothen).

In the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season, after four seasons in the top division, Bastia finished bottom of the Ligue 1 table and were relegated to Ligue 2.

=== Sharp fall, financial troubles and climb back to professional football ===
On 22 June 2017, Bastia were relegated again to Championnat National after the DNCG had recommended a further demotion for the club. Bastia were the subject of an audit on their books which resulted in yet another demotion for failing to guarantee they had the finances to compete in Ligue 2. The DNCG released a statement on the same day stating “Following its audit today before the DNCG, Sporting Club Bastia has been given notice of a provisional relegation&quot;. In August 2017 following bankruptcy proceedings, the clubs professional section was liquidated. The club was taken over by local entrepreneurs Claude Ferrandi (Ferrandi Group) and Pierre-Noël Luiggi (Oscaro group). Following the takeover, the club restarted with its prior reserve team in Championnat National 3. After a difficult first season in National 3, the club would embark on a series of back-to-back promotions, starting with promotion to the Championnat National 2 in the 2018–19 season, and then to the Championnat National in the 2019–20 season, by being top of the National 2 Group A table when the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bastia achieved their third successive promotion after being crowned champion of the 2020–21 Championnat National.

=== Creation of a cooperative structure ===
At the beginning of the 2019-2020 Championnat National 2, the club announced the creation of a cooperative structure, under the form of a Société coopérative d&#x27;intérêt collectif, which allows anyone identifying in different types of supporter categories to invest and hold shares in the club. The voting rights structure and board is divided into four colleges:

* Founders (Ferrandi and Luiggi families) - 38% voting rights and 4 board seats
* Economic actors (businesses and organizations) - 22% voting rights and 2 board seats
* Supporters - 20% voting rights and 2 board seats
* Employees and prior employees (players, staff and administrative personnel) - 10% voting rights and 1 board seat
* Public entities (Regional and municipal authorities) - 10% voting rights
* SC Bastia Association - 1 board seat

This structure allows the club to involve any type of supporter into the clubs decision-making, in a transparent structure. 

=== Return to professional football ===
SC Bastia returned to professional football for the first time since its bankruptcy in 2017, playing in the 2021–22 Ligue 2. After a difficult start to the season which would result in the sacking of manager Mathieu Chabert on September 22nd, following a 2-1 defeat away to Valenciennes, with Bastia 18th in the table, just before the derby against AC Ajaccio. The club would then announce the hiring of Régis Brouard on October 2, 2021. The club would go on to a comfortable mid-table finish in 12th. 

The following season, the club would go on to an up-and-down first half of season, before an extremely strong second half that would see Regis Brouard guide the club to a 4th place finish, having for a long time looked towards promotion in a three-way fight with Bordeaux and Metz. During the summer break, expectations were high and the fans wanted to see the club fight for promotion. The club would go on to have a difficult first half of the season, being 15th at the halfway point. In a repeat of the previous sacking, coach Regis Brouard would be sacked following a 3-1 defeat away to Valenciennes and just before the derby against Ajaccio on January 29th. Reserve team coach Michel Moretti and assistant coach Lillian Laslandes were brought on as caretaker coaches until the end of the season, guiding the team to a 13th place finish. 

The club announced the arrival and return of Frédéric Antonetti as Technical Director on March 26th 2024, with the responsibility of overseeing the sporting policy of the first team as well as the youth and reserve teams. Benoit Tavenot would then be named first team coach on June 5th, also returning to SC Bastia for the 2024–25 Ligue 2 season.

== Stadium ==
Stade Armand Cesari, also known as Stade Furiani, is the main football stadium in Corsica. It is located in Furiani, and is used by SC Bastia. In 1992, the stadium hosted the semi-finals of the Coupe de France during which a temporary grandstand collapsed, killing 18 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

Totally obsolete and even dangerous (barbed wire around the ground, dilapidated stands), the stadium hosted the 1978 UEFA Cup Final. The stadium&#x27;s capacity was then less than 12,000 seats, in precarious conditions, heavy rain having fallen on Corsica that day, turning the ground into a quagmire, which handicapped the outcome of this decisive match (0–0). The crowd of 15,000 spectators announced appears exaggerated, but given the fervor not hesitate to stand up, packed tightly, to attend the game. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 1 September 2012, when 15,505 people saw Bastia lose against St. Etienne (0–3) in a league match. Behind it the following record was set in 1978, when 15,000 people saw Bastia draw against PSV Eindhoven (0–0, 1978) in the UEFA Cup final matches.

== Logos ==
== Colours and badge ==
For the 2011–12 season, the club decided to change the logo. This is the explanation; &quot;&quot;1- Replacing the name &quot;SCB&quot;. Spoken in the aisles of Armand Cesari since its inception. &quot;Bastia&quot; is the club of the city. 2- To recall the historic jersey from 1978, the shield has a moor&#x27;s head, from the Testa Mora Flag. 3- It also reappeared as in the 70s and the heyday of the club. 4- The dominant color is blue. Always accompanied by white edging and black as official colours of the club since 1992.&quot;&quot;

== Supporters ==
Bastia has a large number of supporters among Corsicans, and their supporters frequently display elements of Corsican nationalism, such as the frequent use of the local language and symbols, and support for the island&#x27;s independence. The fans are known as the &quot;Turchini&quot;, meaning &quot;Blues&quot; in Corsican.

The fans have a rivalry with most mainland supporters, however, their most fierce rivals are Nice with whom they contest the Derby de la Mediterranée, although the derby can also refer to rivalries with Marseille and Monaco. They also have a rivalry with Parisian club PSG due to political tensions between the capital and Corsica.

The other large rivalry is the Corsican derby with fellow islanders AC Ajaccio, and to a lesser extent Gazélec Ajaccio, with whom they compete over the dominance of the island.

Friendship:
Since 2004, the Bastia ultras have maintained a relationship of friendship and respect with the Nuova Guardia , the historic Torres ultras group.

<text>Pedro Abelino Aguirre Cerda (; February 6, 1879 – November 25, 1941) was a Chilean political figure, educator, and lawyer who served as the 22nd president of Chile from 1938 until his death in 1941. A member of the Radical Party since 1906, he was chosen by the left-wing Popular Front coalition as its candidate for the 1938 presidential election and won. He had previously served as deputy for San Felipe, Putaendo and Los Andes from 1915 to 1918, Minister of the Interior from January to September 1918 under president Juan Luis Sanfuentes, deputy for Santiago from 1918 to 1921, Minister of Justice and Public Instruction from 1920 to 1921 under president Arturo Alessandri, and senator for Concepción from 1921 to 1927. He died two years and eleven months into his presidency on November 25, 1941, at the age of 62, from tuberculosis.

==Early life==
Pedro Aguirre Cerda was born on February 6, 1879, in Pocuro, a small village near the city of Los Andes, Chile. He was the seventh of eleven children born to parents Juan Bautista Aguirre Campos and Clarisa Cerda Escudero. His father, a farmer, died in 1887 when he was eight years old, leaving his widowed mother to run the farm and raise the eleven children on her own. His family was of Basque descent.

He completed his initial tertiary studies at the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile in Santiago, becoming a Spanish teacher. He continued his studies at the university&#x27;s faculty of law, becoming a lawyer in 1904. In 1910, he received a government grant to study administrative and financial law at the Sorbonne in Paris and political economy and social legislation at the Collège de France. He returned to Chile in 1914 and took a position as a teacher at the Instituto Nacional and was elected as president of the National Society of Teachers. In 1916, he married his first cousin Juana Rosa Aguirre Luco, with whom he had no children.

He was a very distinguished teacher, attorney, deputy and senator. He was also the first dean of the new school of economy of the University of Chile. As a member of the Radical Party, he was minister of Public Instruction and of the Interior during the administrations of Juan Luis Sanfuentes and Arturo Alessandri. During the period of military domination, he was persecuted and became an active opposition leader to the government of General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo.

He was chosen by the Popular Front coalition of left-wing parties and trade unions as its candidate in the 1938 Chilean presidential election, where he narrowly defeated right-wing candidate of the Liberal-Conservative coalition by 4,111 votes.

==Presidency==
Aguirre Cerda assumed his duties as president on December 25, 1938, under the slogan &quot;Gobernar es educar&quot; (to govern is to educate). As a teacher, his priority in government was education. As such, he promoted the development of the technical-industrial schools as a means to promote the formation of technicians for the nascent industrialization of the country. He also created thousands of new regular schools and encouraged the growth of the university system to cover the whole of the country. Aguirre&#x27;s government also redistributed some land, encouraged the formation of agricultural settlements, built low-cost housing and schools, and integrated the Marxist parties into the political system.

During his first year he had to face military opposition to his plans, which boiled over with the so-called Ariostazo. He also promoted and campaigned for a Nobel Prize for Gabriela Mistral, which only came to fruition under his successor, Juan Antonio Ríos.

On the economic side, and prompted in part by the devastating earthquake of 1939, he created the Production Development Corporation (&quot;Corporación de Fomento de la Producción&quot; - CORFO) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization. This was the basis for the industrialization of Chile. From there sprung the steel, manufacturing and sugar industries.

In 1941, due to his rapidly escalating illness, he appointed his Minister of the Interior Jerónimo Méndez as vice-president to succeed him. He died soon after on November 25, 1941, in Santiago, Chile, from tuberculosis. Méndez served as acting president until Juan Antonio Rios, elected on February 1, 1942, took office on April 2.

==Legacy==

In the Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1950–51, the explorers named the Aguirre Passage between Lemaire Island and Danco Coast after Don Pedro Aguirre Cerda.

Salvador Allende, one of Aguirre Cerda&#x27;s close associates and Minister of Health under his presidency, would become president in 1970.

On July 3, 2018, another statue of him was inaugurated in the center of Santiago, this time in the Plaza de la Constitución, on the corner of Moneda and Teatinos streets.

<doc id="1256444" wikidata="Q5180039" url="?curid=1256444" title="Coyote (novel)">
<text>Coyote (2002) is a science fiction novel by American writer Allen Steele, the first in a series of eight books. It is a fixup of several of Steele&#x27;s previously-published short stories, beginning with &quot;Stealing Alabama&quot; in the January 2001 issue of Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction.

The series has been noted for the constructed Lemarean Calendar the author created for its inhabited extrasolar moon, Coyote.

==Plot summary ==

The year is 2070. The United Republic of America, under an authoritarian conservative New Christian Right regime constructed after the Second American Revolution, is managed by Liberty Party autocrats. It faces economic sanctions from other powers due to its repressive and xenophobic policies, notably its unilateral establishment of an orbiting nuclear weapons delivery system. The nation has built its first starship: the URSS &quot;Alabama&quot;. The welcoming celebration for Captain Robert E. Lee takes a sudden turn when Lee initiates his plan to steal the &quot;Alabama&quot;. Working with a handful of conspirators, Lee manages to alter the computer software and override the clearance codes. URS soldiers storm aboard to stop Lee, but they are too late. Not wishing to abandon their orders, Colonel Reese and the other soldiers become stowaways.

Captain Lee knew exactly what he was doing. His destination: the 47 Ursae Majoris system, some 46 light years away—far enough to escape the tyrannical United Republic. At a cruise velocity of .2 &quot;c&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot; would not arrive at its destination until 230 Earth years have passed. So the crew of 104 soldiers, scientists, and civilians were put in biostasis, to be awakened from their virtual immortality by the ship&#x27;s AI 226 years into the future. (Four years are spared due to time dilation.) 47 Ursae Majoris&#x27; system has four planets—named Fox, Raven, Bear and Wolf after Native American mythology. Bear has six satellites—Dog, Hawk, Eagle, Coyote, Snake and Goat. Of these six, Coyote is large enough to support its own biosphere.

Just three months into the journey, something goes terribly wrong. Leslie Gillis, the senior communications officer, is awakened from biostasis. Expecting the year to be 2300, Gillis is horrified when he questions the AI. There was a mixup, and now it is inexplicably impossible for Gillis to return to his dreamless sleep. His options are either suicide or a lonely existence. While suicide may be more honorable than consuming his crewmates&#x27; rations, Gillis chooses life.

After a brief chat with the AI, Gillis learns that Eric Gunther was originally scheduled to awaken three months into the trip. Gunther is an agent for the URA, and was to attempt to contact the president or destroy the ship. The program was changed at the last minute to wake someone else instead—Gillis. Gillis leaves a note for Captain Lee explaining Gunther&#x27;s plot. Why they were changed at the last minute remains a mystery, but it was a change that would cost Gillis his life.

During his solitary life, he does everything he can to keep from going insane, attempting to eat and sleep at regular hours, reading all of the books available, playing chess against the AI, writing stories, and painting. Using practically all of the ship&#x27;s art supplies, Gillis creates a story about a prince named Rupurt and the fantastic alien world he lives in. He paints scenes of his books on the walls. Eventually, Gillis dies in his old age after a fall from a ladder while trying to get a better look at an alien ship he has seen. The AI automatically expels his body into space and sails on to 47 Ursae Majoris with no more incidents.

The crew is awakened as planned in the year 2300. The &quot;Alabama&quot; has entered the 47 Ursae Majoris system and is approaching its third planet, Bear (currently known as 47 Ursae Majoris b) is a gas giant. Coyote, its fourth moon, is larger than Mars and is lush with green plants and rivers of water. This will be the crew&#x27;s new home. Captain Lee directs the landing procedures of the two ships docked to the &quot;Alabama&quot;, the &quot;Wallace&quot; and the &quot;Helms&quot;.

The crew finds Coyote to be habitable, but very peculiar nevertheless. Its seasons change at a much slower rate than Earth&#x27;s. A year for Coyote consists of 1,096 days, with days lasting 27 hours. Lifeforms on Coyote seem similar to those on Earth at first glance, but behave in unique ways. As described in Gillis&#x27; novel, the world is home to gigantic bird-like creatures which are anything but friendly. The settlers call them &quot;boids&quot;, which is Gillis&#x27; term for the beasts in his novel. Boids are common in the grasslands around the new settlement.

The remainder of &quot;Coyote&quot; follows the adventures of Carlos Montero and Wendy Gunther along the banks of the equatorial river which stretches around Coyote.

<doc id="1256445" wikidata="Q193377" url="?curid=1256445" title="Stade Malherbe Caen">
<text>Stade Malherbe Caen (; commonly known as SM Caen, Malherbe, or simply Caen) is a French professional football team, based in the city of Caen in Normandy, that competes in the Ligue 2. The club was founded on 17 November 1913 by the merger of &quot;Club Malherbe Caennais&quot; and &quot;Club Sportif Caennais&quot;. The team takes its name from François de Malherbe, a 17th-century poet from Caen.

For most of its history, SM Caen has been one of the main amateur clubs in France. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the rise of Stade Malherbe in the French football hierarchy. In 1985, Stade Malherbe adopted professional status. Three seasons later, it was promoted for the first time to first division. In 1992, a few months after being narrowly saved from bankruptcy, the club finished fifth in Division 1 and qualified for UEFA Cup. However, it was relegated three years later. Despite a second division title won in 1996, SM Caen fell back into anonymity in the second division.

Under the chairmanship of Jean-François Fortin, from 2002, and under the sporting direction of Patrick Rémy, Franck Dumas, and then Patrice Garande, the Stade Malherbe has regained sporting success. The club was promoted into Ligue 1 several times, reached the Coupe de la Ligue final in 2005 and finished 7th in Ligue 1 in 2016. In 2018, during the club&#x27;s fifth consecutive season in Ligue 1, a conflict erupted within the management team, causing the departure of chairman Jean-François Fortin and coach Patrice Garande. Caen was relegated to Ligue 2 in 2019. Facing financial troubles, it was bought by the American fund Oaktree Capital Management in 2020, which appointed Olivier Pickeu as the new president. In 2024, Oaktree&#x27;s 80% stake was acquired by investment firm Coalition Capital, a subsidiary of Kylian Mbappé&#x27;s company Interconnected Ventures. 

SM Caen has been playing since 1993 at the Stade Michel d&#x27;Ornano. Before and since its foundation, the club played at Stade de Venoix, which is now used by the reserve team. It has geographical rivalries with Le Havre AC (sometimes called &quot;Le derby normand&quot;) and Stade Rennais, its closest neighbour when the club was in Ligue 1.

==History==
===Genesis (Before 1913)===
Many football clubs were constituted in Caen at the end of the 19th century : the &quot;Union sportive des étudiants de Caen&quot;, founded in 1892, the &quot;Union Athlétique du Lycée Malherbe&quot; (UALM), founded in 1892 or 1895 and the &quot;Club Sportif Caennais&quot;, founded in November 1899. These clubs participated in the early editions of the football championship organised by the &quot;Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques&quot;.

In 1907, former members of UALM created the &quot;Club Malherbe Caennais&quot;, soon the best club in Lower Normandy. In 1909 and 1911, several friendlies matches were organised between a selection of players from Caen and the English club of St Albans City F.C.

===First years and first professional adventure (1913–1947)===
The &quot;Stade Malherbe Caennais&quot; was officially founded on 17 November 1913 from the merger of &quot;Club Sportif Caennais&quot; and &quot;Club Malherbe Caennais&quot;. It was a multi-sport athletic club, which adopted the &quot;Malherbe&quot; and the striped jersey of the CMC, and the red and blue colours of CSC. The club had its own facilities – the Stade de Venoix – inherited from the CMC.

The football team of CMC, engaged in the league in Lower Normandy, changed its name just after the start of the season. By winning this competition, Stade Malherbe recorded their first title in its first year of existence. Having qualified for the finals of the 1914 USFSA Football Championship, Caen was eliminated in the 1/8 final by the Union sportive Servannaise : after a draw in the first game (3–3) it had to forfeit the second. World War I stopped the competitions. Thirty-nine members of the club were killed in the fighting, including former captain Eugène Lesomptier.

In 1919, the USFSA championship was replaced by regional championships organised by the French Football Federation, called &quot;Division d&#x27;Honneur&quot;. Stade Malherbe, reinforced by the move to Caen of the former French international Eugène Maës, won six times the championship of Lower Normandy between 1920 and 1928, but were unable to compete with the major Upper Normandy clubs, Le Havre AC and FC Rouen. Since 1919–20, Caen also participated in the Coupe de France but fell in round of 32 in 1921 and 1922. In 1929, the two &quot;Division d&#x27;Honneur&quot; leagues of Normandy were merged and Stade Malherbe was promoted the year after. Its best final standing was 5th in 1933.

In 1934, one year after FC Rouen and Le Havre AC, Stade Malherbe acquired professional status and reached the French Division 2. The club finished 11th out of 16 for the first season, then 6th in 1936 and 8th in 1937. But its financial situation deteriorated and Stade Malherbe left D2 in 1938, after four professional seasons.

The club then returned to &quot;Division d&#x27;Honneur&quot; of Normandy. It won the last edition before World War II in 1938–39, and the first two after WW2 in 1946 and 1947.

===An important amateur club (1948–1985)===
In 1948, Stade Malherbe joined the newly founded &quot;&quot;, the third level of French football. Soon considered as a &quot;lord&quot; in CFA, Caen was unable to win the championship, unlike their regional rival US Quevilly, despite successive calls to former French international players as coaches: Jules Vandooren, Jean Prouff, Andre Grillon, Jean Vincent and Oliver Celestin.

Stade Malherbe made itself known essentially by repeated feats in Coupe de France in the 1950s : French champion Stade de Reims (2–1) and top teams Racing Club de France (3–2) and RC Lens were defeated in January 1953, 1956, and 1961. In 1958, Caen pushed FC Nantes to play five games to decide: the first three games resulting in 0–0 draws, the fourth was stopped, the fifth saw Nantes win 1–0. Through its success Caen won the &quot;Challenge France-Football&quot; rewarding the best amateur team in Coupe de France in 1956 and 1961. Undermined by the instability of its coaches and presidents and a precarious financial health, Stade Malherbe weakened gradually and was relegated twice (in 1962 and 1965) into Division d&#x27;Honneur, but regained its place in CFA.

In 1970, the CFA was removed and the Division 2 was enlarged to 48 teams. During the 1970s, Caen evolved between D3 and D2, where it failed to stabilise. Jacques Mouilleron became coach in 1973. In 1975, the club won its first national title: the West group of Division 3. Stade Malherbe was named best amateur club by France-Football and Jean-Paul Bouffandeau and Jean-Paul Pottier were named French amateur players of the year in 1975 and 1976. 3 years later, Caen fell back to D3.

Pierre Mankowski was hired as player-coach in 1983. He led Stade Malherbe from D3 to the top of D2 in a few seasons, and pushed it to adopt professional status in 1985.

===From D2 to the European Cup (1985–1993)===

SM Caen has been a professional football club since 1985. The stated objective of Mankowski was to bring Caen into the first division. He helped the team improve, first in defence then in attack. Caen finished sixth in D2 in 1986 and second in 1987, with notable scorers Philippe Prieur and Éric Pécout. Caen made the stade de Venoix an unbeatable place but bowed out in front of AS Cannes in the playoffs. Caen succeeded in the playoffs following season, defeating Olympique Lyonnais and Chamois Niortais F.C., relegated from D1.

In 1988 Stade Malherbe made Division 1. Despite many departures, including coach Mankowski (replaced by Robert Nouzaret) and six first losses, Caen stayed up, one point ahead of RC Strasbourg, with the advent of a promising striker Fabrice Divert. Stade Malherbe confirmed, not without difficulties, its performance the following season.

With a new coach, Daniel Jeandupeux, the team was largely restructured. In 1990–91, Caen took its place in the first half of Division 1, thanks to the excellent results obtained in Venoix. However, the press revealed in late 1991 that the club was close to bankruptcy. Regional businesses and local government bailed out the club, which led to a brilliant 1991–92 season. Stade Malherbe finished fifth and qualified for the first (and so far only) time for the UEFA Cup. Stéphane Paille scored 15 goals during the season. For the first round of the 1992–93 UEFA Cup, Caen had to face up to Real Zaragoza. Caen won 3–2 in the 1st leg but lost 2–0 in Spain. Despite the goals of Xavier Gravelaine, SM Caen finished the season in a relatively disappointing eleventh rank.

===Between First and Second Division (since 1993)===

In the 2003–04 season, Caen finished 2nd in Ligue 2, gaining promotion to Ligue 1. They were relegated on the last day of the 2004–05 Ligue 1 season, finishing in 18th place despite some positive results, including a surprise 3–2 away win at Marseille. But the main highlight of their season was making it into the final of the Coupe de la Ligue for the first time in their history. Their chance at a major trophy eluded them however, as they lost 2–1 to Strasbourg in the final.

On 25 May 2007, SM Caen obtained promotion to Ligue 1 after a victory in last game at Libourne (1–2). In the 2008–09 season, the team was once again relegated to Ligue 2 after losing 1–0 at home to Bordeaux, but won championship next season and thus came back to Ligue 1.

In the 2010–11 season, Caen got off to a highly impressive start by defeating defending champions Marseille 2–1 away on the first day of the season, then following it up with a 3–2 home win over the previous season&#x27;s Champions League semi-finalists Lyon.

In the 2013–14 season, Caen were in Ligue 2, but won promotion to Ligue 1 for the 2014–15 season. As part of their promotion battle, they drew a crucial match with Nîmes in May 2014. This 1–1 result was also very favourable to Nîmes who were battling to avoid relegation. This result raised suspicions, and in November 2014, Caen chairman Fortin was arrested, amongst several others, on suspicion of match fixing. Finally, he was cleared in March 2015. For the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons, Caen avoided relegation to Ligue 2 on both occasions by securing a draw on the final day of the season against Paris Saint-Germain.

In the 2018–19 season, Caen were relegated on the final day of the campaign after losing to Bordeaux 1–0. Caen needed to win the match and hope that results elsewhere would go in their favour. The relegation ended Caen&#x27;s five-year stay in the top division.

In September 2024, French star Kylian Mbappé became the majority owner of the club.

In December 2024, Josselin Flamand is appointed as a new Managing Director.

&quot;* denotes promotion without winning the championship.&quot;

==Club crest and colours==

Club Malherbe Caennais wore a black and white vertical stripes jersey, while Club Sportif Caennais used blue and red horizontal stripes. Following the merger of two clubs in 1913, the officials decided to mix colours and symbols by adopting the CMC vertical stripes and CSC colours.

Stade Malherbe used the same diamond shaped logo for almost fifty years, designed for its first professional period in 1934.

In 1989, a new logo was designed, with a longship floating on the waves, a nod to the Viking origin of Normandy, and three arrows of the city of Caen. It was used in various versions for eighteen seasons, including within a shield in the 2006–07 season. In 2007, officials presented a new logo.
The new logo reflects the identity of the club, closely linked to the Norman period of William the Conqueror: the flag of Normandy, which is actually the historical Norman flag of the Two Lions, can be often seen in the Kop Normandy.
In 2013, the official anthem of SM Caen &quot;Normands, fiers et conquérants!&quot; was made with a marked reference to the Norman identity:

:&quot;Représenter la Normandie est un honneur
:Derrière nos léopards nous chanterons en cœur!
:Décrire cette belle région
:Doit se faire à l&#x27;unisson
:Nous sommes Normands, fiers et conquérant!
:Portons les couleurs du Stade Malherbe de Caen,

==Stadiums==
Stade de Venoix was the club&#x27;s home from 1913, although the first stand was built only in 1925, until 1993. Venoix could hold over 15,000 spectators at its peak, and now has a capacity of 5,000.

In 1993 a new 21,500-capacity stadium was built, named Stade Michel d&#x27;Ornano. The new stadium is around 500 meters away from the Stade de Venoix.
