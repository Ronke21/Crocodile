<text>The Big Thicket is the name given to a somewhat imprecise region of a heavily forested area of Southeast Texas in the United States. This area represents a portion of the mixed pine-hardwood forests or &quot;Piney Woods&quot; of the Southeast US. The National Park Service established the Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) within the region in 1974 and it is recognized as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. Although the diversity of animals in the area is high for a temperate zone with over 500 vertebrates, it is the complex mosaic of ecosystems and plant diversity that is particularly remarkable. Biologists have identified at least eight, and up to eleven, ecosystems in the Big Thicket area. More than 160 species of trees and shrubs, 800 herbs and vines, and 340 types of grasses are known to occur in the Big Thicket, and estimates as high as over 1000 flowering plant species and 200 trees and shrubs have been made, plus ferns, carnivorous plants, and more. The Big Thicket has historically been the most dense forest region in Texas.

Existing literature states that Native Americans were known to have lived and hunted in the area nomadically, but did not establish permanent settlements there before the Alabama–Coushatta settled in the northeast about 1780. However, there is insufficient archaeological evidence to support this claim. What records that do exist could suggest human occupation dating back to the Clovis culture 13,400–12,700 years ago, with numerous era diagnostic points being found in all but one of the counties commonly considered to be in the Big Thicket. Spanish explorers and missionaries had a sporadic presence in the region, however colonization and settlement was not their aim, preferring to establish forts outside of the Region where the French were encroaching from the east (namely around Natchitoches, Nacogdoches, and the lower Trinity river valley). Logging in the late 19th and 20th centuries dramatically reduced the forest concentration. Efforts to save the Big Thicket from the devastation of oil and lumber industries started as early as the 1920s with the founding of the East Texas Big Thicket Association by Richard Elmer Jackson.

Conservatively the area occupies all of Hardin County, most of Polk, and Tyler Counties, and parts of Jasper, Liberty and San Jacinto Counties, including areas between the Neches River on the east, the Trinity River on the west, Pine Island Bayou on the south, to the higher elevations and older Eocene geological formations to the north. Broader interpretations have included the area between the Sabine River on the east and the San Jacinto River on the west including much of Montgomery, Newton, Trinity, and Walker Counties, as well. Several attempts to define the boundaries of the Big Thicket have been made, including a biological survey in 1936 which included over covering 14 counties. A later botanical based study in 1972 included a region of over . This same habitat extends into Louisiana and eastward.

==Geography==
=== Physical geography ===
Geology: The Big Thicket is notable for the unusually high diversity of plants concentrated in a relatively small area. A major factor enabling this diversity is an unusually high diversity of soils. The exposed surface soils are relatively recent, late Cenozoic Era, predominantly Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene Epoch formations. Other than some slight and uniform tilting, the strata are not greatly deformed. The strata were laid down in several cycles of glaciations and warmer interglacial interludes. Although glaciers never extended as far south as Texas, it was during these cold periods that enough water was frozen in polar regions to lower sea levels and the Big Thicket area was dry land well above sea level. Conversely, during the warmer interludes, enough ice melted to increase sea levels and submerge Southeast Texas in the sea. It was during those warmer periods of submersion that alluvial and delta deposits from the streams and rivers of the continent laid down the succession of strata, each new layer burying and compacting the previous. At some point there was an approximately 1% tilting of the layers. Some say it was caused by the rising of the Rocky Mountains, while others say it was the weight of the successive deposits that eventually caused the Gulf of Mexico to subside. The older Pliocene, Miocene, and Oligocene formations are exposed in the north (Polk, San Jacinto, and Tyler counties), while the more recent Quaternary Period formations are exposed in the south (Hardin and Liberty counties).

Soils: The soils of the various formations at the surface have shifted and intermingled through erosion and other factors over time and can be locally quite complex. The Big Thicket contains a greater variety of soils than any area of comparable size in the United States. Sources vary, but from 50 to 100 soil types are said to occur in Hardin County alone. The surface soils tend to be slightly to strongly acidic, and only occasionally neutral in much of the Big Thicket Basin. However, calcareous or alkaline soils do occur in the region, particularly along the Trinity River, in the Beaumont Formation to the south, the Fleming Formation to the north, and northern areas of the Willis Formation where the layer is thin and erosion and road cuts have exposed the Fleming Formation. Most plants are sensitive to soil pH levels (acidic, neutral, or alkaline) and many species will only grow in areas with a specific soil type. Claude A. McLeod&#x27;s study stated that the Big Thicket was &quot;an edaphicmesophytic climax forest&quot; – &quot;edaphic&quot;, meaning the soil is a greater influence on the plants than the climate, and &quot;mesophytic&quot; meaning a medium moisture level.
Topography: The Big Thicket Basin has been described as shallow bowl or dish, tilted to one side, with the high rim on the interior north and low rim on the coastal south. Eastern and western rims consist of the low ridges that divide the Neches River and Sabine River drainages on the east and the Neches River and Trinity River drainages on the west. Elevations range from about in the north to in the south, dropping as low as at confluence of the Neches River and Pine Island Bayou. Northern regions are characterized by low gently rolling hills and well-formed drainage systems of streams and creeks in the landscape. The southern regions are comparatively flat, with poor drainage and support moderately extensive wetlands.

Hydrology: Hardin, Tyler, western Jasper and southeast Polk counties are drained by the Neches River and its tributaries: Village Creek and its smaller tributaries (Beach, Theuvenins, Turkey, Hickory, Kimball, Big Sandy, and Cypress creeks) in the north; Pine Island Bayou and its smaller tributaries (Little Pine Island Bayou and Mayhaw Bayou) in the south. Eastern regions, including eastern Jasper and Newton counties, are drained by several relatively short creeks running into the Sabine River. Western regions including central Liberty, northeastern San Jacinto, northern Walker counties and southwest Polk County (via Kickapoo, Long King, and Menard creeks) are drained by the Trinity River. Areas farther west are drained by the San Jacinto River, with east and west forks. Additional wetlands are extensive, including innumerable nameless swamps, cypress sloughs, oxbow lakes, wetland savannas, and baygall bogs. Floodplains and bottomlands in the south, can retain surface water for days and weeks after rain. The Sabine and Neches rivers flow into Sabine Lake, a natural occurring brackish water estuary, just southeast of the Big Thicket. The other large lakes in the region were constructed in the decades following the Second World War, including B.A. Steinhagen Lake (1947–53) and Sam Rayburn Reservoir (1956–65) on the Neches River drainage, Lake Livingston (1966–69) on the Trinity River, Lake Houston (1953) and Lake Conroe (1970–73) on the San Jacinto River.

Climate: The proximity to the Gulf of Mexico gives the region a climate of mild winters, hot summers, and high humidity most of the year. Average precipitation is a year, with northern areas receiving about , and southern areas receiving about . However, tropical storms and hurricanes can increase annual rainfall to over . Humidity stays well above 60% most of the time and exceeds 90% often. Winters are mild, with nighttime lows averaging and daytime highs . Winter cold fronts can drop temperatures to freezing, but freezes rarely last for more than a few days, sometimes only hours, averaging about 20 mostly nonconsecutive days each year. Snow is rare, occurring only once every ten years or so. Summer temperatures are hot, with nighttime lows averaging and daytime highs averaging . Temperatures exceed about 110 days each year and days with temperatures above and even above are not uncommon. The high summer temperatures with high humidity levels can produce very high heat index numbers.

Economy: Timber, oil and gas, and agriculture continue to be significant to the economy of the area. Many people commute to work in oil refineries and related industries in the Beaumont area. Other sources list industries providing significant employment in Hardin County as: educational, health and social services, construction, recreation, accommodation and food services, finance, insurance, real estate, and rental and leasing.

===Ecosystems===
On a larger scale of ecoregions of the United States, the Big Thicket is part of the Piney Woods. The Big Thicket is located in the southwest of the Piney Woods and transitions into the Western Gulf coastal grasslands immediately to the south. To the west are the Texas Blackland Prairies and East Central Texas forests (a.k.a. post-oak savanna). Within the Big Thicket, a major component in the high diversity of plants and animals is the variety of ecosystems present in a relatively small area. The National Park Service identifies eight plant communities in Big Thicket National Preserve. Some biologist and plant ecologists identify as many as nine, ten, or eleven ecosystems in the Big Thicket. In nature these ecosystems are not always found in pure, large tracts of land, and often occur in intertwined and checkerboard mixes and ecotones, transitioning into one another. Ecosystems do not have universal standardized names. Many ecologist, botanist, zoologist and others have studied and classified ecosystems in the Big Thicket region (and elsewhere), defining and naming these communities as relevant to their own disciplines and studies. Although the exact names, definitions, and boundaries might vary (subdivided, compounded, or overlapping), below are summaries of ten major ecosystems recognized by most who have studied and written about the Big Thicket, starting with higher elevations in the north, and in a generalized way, moving to lower elevations in the south.

Uplands (aka: longleaf pine-bluestem uplands; dry upland forests; longleaf pine uplands) In its natural state, this ecosystem is often described as having a park-like appearance, with widely spaced pine and oak trees, and grasses growing in the partially shaded open areas. Longleaf pine-bluestem grass uplands are most extensive in northern areas, on higher elevation plateaus between streams and dry upper slopes, where the soils of the Catahoula, Fleming, Willis, and Bentley formations often have several feet of moderately coarse sand over an iron oxide clay or plinthite hardpan stratum. The permeable sands and topography provide good drainage in the uplands which are relatively dry. Smaller fragments of this type are also found throughout the south where higher ridges, hills, and knolls occur. Longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) is a common species in this ecosystem and one of the dominant trees along with shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;) and a variety of oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot;). Understory shrubs include flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;) and American holly (&quot;Ilex opaca&quot;). Plant ecologist Geraldine Watson stated the U.S. Forest Service grass herbarium in Louisiana has over 200 species of grasses from this range and various bluestem grasses (&quot;Andropogon&quot;) are the dominant ground cover. Wildflowers like purple pleat-leaf (&quot;Alophia drummondii&quot;) and bird-foot violet (&quot;Viola pedata&quot;) grow in the lighter, semi-shaded areas, while Texas Dutchman&#x27;s-pipe (&quot;Aristolochia reticulata&quot;) and false foxglove (&quot;Aureolaria grandiflora&quot;) grow in the deeper shade. Streams flowing through these areas can support large stands of southern bracken fern (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;). Longleaf pine, bluestem grass, and many other plants in these areas are pyrophytic (adapted and resistant to wildfire), and wildfires are a critical factor in maintaining this ecosystem. Historically, naturally occurring fires would periodically eliminate non-pyrophytic plant species encroaching on this plant community. However, decades of fire suppression has allowed a wide mixture of species to invade and in time has turned many of the upland localities into beech-magnolia-loblolly slope forest or oak-hickory forest. Additionally, many areas clearcut for lumber have been replanted with rows of the faster growing, non-native slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;) eliminating much of the longleaf pine-bluestem grass uplands from Texas.

Sandylands (aka: arid oak-farkleberry sandylands; sand ridge savanna; sandhill pine forests; arid sandylands): Sandylands resemble and have much in common with upland forest, with open grassy areas and widely spaced trees. However, the fundamental difference lies in the soils. These areas reside on deep sand dunes deposited by ancient seas and rivers. In contrast to the uplands where a few feet of coarse sand sits on a hardpan stratum, sandylands sit on layers of fine sand with thin layers of siliceous silt that can be over a hundred feet deep, with little clay and low fertility. Although these areas receive the same rainfall as the rest of the region, water drains quickly in the deep sand which dries in the sun leaving an arid surface. The ground cover can be meager in places with sparse grasses, lichen, or even exposed sand in some spots. Plants adapted to arid environments like Louisiana yucca (&quot;Yucca louisianensis&quot;) and prairie prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia macrorhiza&quot;) are conspicuous indicators of sandylands in the humid Big Thicket climate. Although found throughout the region, some of the largest and best examples are in the vicinity of the Neches River and Village Creek. In the more arid sites bluejack oak (&quot;Quercus incana&quot;), sand post oak (&quot;Quercus margaretta&quot;), north blackjack oak (&quot;Quercus marilandica&quot;), post oak (&quot;Quercus stellata&quot;), black hickory (&quot;Carya texana&quot;), and mockernut hickory (&quot;Carya tomentosa&quot;) are dominant hardwoods. With increasing moisture levels longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) and loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;) emerge over the oaks. Longleaf pine is characteristic of sandylands, but not always dominant. Farkleberry (&quot;Vaccinium arboreum&quot;) is the dominant shrub in the understory. Several rare wildflowers with limited distributions in Texas can be found in this environment; examples include Oklahoma prairie clover (&quot;Petalostemum griseum&quot;), Carolina vervain (&quot;Stylodon carneus&quot; = &quot;Verbena carnea&quot;), Hooker palafoxia (&quot;Palafoxia hookeriana&quot;), green-thread (&quot;Thelesperma flavodiscum&quot;), and trailing phlox (&quot;Phlox nivalis texensis&quot;) which is also an endangered species. Like the uplands, periodic wildfires are essential to keeping the understory open and preserving this ecosystem. These areas are said to have been preferred habitation sites for the nomadic Atakapa-Ishak people in Pre-Columbian times.

Savannas (aka: longleaf - black gum savannahs; wetland longleaf pine savannas; wetland pine savannas; pine savannah wetlands) If the sandylands described above resemble a well drained and arid version of the uplands, the savanna wetlands might be described as a poorly drained, wet version. This ecosystem is characterized by the same open spaces with widely spaced pine trees as uplands and sandylands, but differs in being very flat, with a relatively thin layer of low nutrient, fine, packed sand, sitting on hardpan which is very near the surface. The nearly impervious hardpan both inhibits drainage in wet periods as well as prevents moisture from rising in dry periods. The severity of the fluctuating water table, along with occasional low-intensity ground fires that are necessary to sustain this ecosystem, limit the plants that can grow there. Savanna wetlands are most often found to the south of the uplands, on the Montgomery and recent Bentley formations, although they are not entirely restricted to this zone. Longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) along with black gum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), often stunted, make up much of the overstory, being among the few trees that grow in the severe conditions. Ground cover is dominated by rushes, sedges (&quot;Rhynchospora&quot; and &quot;Scleria&quot;), and grasses including &quot;Andropogon&quot;, &quot;Aristida&quot;, &quot;Muhlenbergia&quot;, and little bluestem (&quot;Schizachyrium scoparium&quot;). Within the flat savannas, the slightest change in elevation can produce significantly different vegetation. Occasional mounds with two or three feet of sand, support upland habitat, while depressions of just a few inches can hold acid bogs, with low pH levels and low levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and calcium. Even the peripheral areas around acid bogs, distinguished by subtle sloping elevations of only an inch or two, sustain a distinct zone of vegetation. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses and carnivorous plants are adapted to these environments, including the pitcher plant (&quot;Sarracenia alata&quot;), annual sundew (&quot;Drosera brevifolia&quot;), rush bladderwort (&quot;Utricularia juncea&quot;), and small butterwort (&quot;Pinguicula pumila&quot;). A number of orchids are found in savannas including the grass pink orchid (&quot;Calopogon tuberosus&quot;), yellow fringed orchid (&quot;Platanthera ciliaris&quot;), snowy orchid (&quot;Platanthera nivea&quot;), and snake mouth orchid (&quot;Pogonia ophioglossoides&quot;).

Slope forests (aka: beech-magnolia-loblolly slopes; mesic upland forests: lower slope hardwood pine forest; beech-magnolia-loblolly pine association): Slope forest have a wide mix of conifers, deciduous, and evergreen broad-leaved trees occupying the gentle slopes between the wet bottomlands and the dryer uplands. Small spring-fed streams drain the slopes before reaching the larger creeks. The closed canopy filters the light reaching the forest floor where an ample layer of leaf litter holds water, creating a mesic understory. The soils are relatively fertile with fine, loamy, sands and are well to moderately drained. The purest examples of slope forest are found on the soils of the Willis Formation with red clay in Jasper, Newton, Polk, and Tyler counties, but they extend well into the lower, southern regions where soils and topography are suitable, particularly along the slopes of the waterways. A variety of trees co-dominate slope forest and these can vary with elevation and moisture. In higher and less humid areas, forest shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;), loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), and southern red oak (&quot;Quercus falcata&quot;) co-dominate, but sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;) and blackgum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;) are also common. More humid areas tend to shift to American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), southern magnolia (&quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;), and American holly (&quot;Ilex opaca&quot;) co-dominating with loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), but include a wide variety of other hardwoods such as white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;) and sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;). In the lowest, flatter areas of the south, beech trees tend to drop out and are replaced by chestnut oak or basket oak (&quot;Quercus michauxii&quot;) and laurel oak (&quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot;). Understory trees and shrubs include Hercules-club or toothache tree (&quot;Zanthoxylum clava-herculis&quot;), hoary azalea (&quot;Rhododendron canescens&quot;), redbud (&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;), and silver bell (&quot;Halesia diptera&quot;). A rich diversity of wildflowers are found in slope forest such as three jack-in-the pulpits (&quot;Arisaema dracontium&quot;, &quot;A. quinatum&quot;, &quot;A. triphyllum&quot;), Indian pipe (&quot;Monotropa uniflora&quot;), and wake-robin (&quot;Trillium gracile&quot;). Orchids include the yellow lady&#x27;s-slipper (&quot;Cypripedium calceolus&quot;), spring coral-root (&quot;Corallorhiza wisteriana&quot;), whorled pogonia (&quot;Isotria verticillata&quot;), southern twayblade (&quot;Listera australis&quot;), crippled crane fly (&quot;Tipularia discolor&quot;), and three birds (&quot;Triphora trianthophora&quot;). Wildfires are much less important to the ecology of the humid slope forest than in the uplands and sandylands, both of which will slowly revert into slope forest when fire is suppressed and slope vegetation that is not tolerant of fire takes hold and fills in the open areas.

Floodplains: (aka: sweet gum - oak floodplains; wet forests: floodplain hardwood forest; oak-gum floodplain; stream floodplains): Often referred to as bottomlands, floodplains are low laying areas adjacent to the larger creeks, bayous, and rivers which overflow and flood with some regularity. The floodwaters deposit rich alluvial soils, moderately permeable silty, sandy loams that support a wide diversity of vegetation. The major floodplains in the region were formed during the Wisconsin glaciation, when sea levels were low and great rivers cut deep and wide channels in the landscape. These channels are now largely filled with sediment and deposits through which the present day rives, much smaller than in the past, wind and meander. Floodplains often occur in terraces with various swales, ridges, and levees stepping down in tiers to the water level. Some ecologists subdivide these terraces into separate ecosystems, including but not limited to, baygalls on the outer margins of higher terraces, and cypress sloughs in the lowest areas. Pine trees are uncommon or absent in the floodplains, which are dominated by deciduous canopy trees including water oak (&quot;Quercus nigra&quot;), chestneu or basket oak (&quot;Quercus michauxii&quot;), willow oak (&quot;Quercus phellos&quot;), cherrybark oak (&quot;Quercus pagoda&quot;), and red oak (&quot;Quercus falcata&quot;). Other important trees include the overcup oak (&quot;Quercus lyrata&quot;) which can grow in and around standing water, sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), blackgum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;), water hickory (&quot;Carya aquatica&quot;), and red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), often with a dense mid-story of ironwood (&quot;Carpinus caroliniana&quot;). Among the many wildflowers are three irises, yellow iris (&quot;Iris pseudacorus&quot;), southern iris (&quot;Iris virginica&quot;), and short-stem iris (&quot;Iris brevicaulis&quot;), as well as the fragrant ladies tresses orchid (&quot;Spiranthes odorata&quot;), blue jasmine (&quot;Clematis crispa&quot;), and the aquatic spatterdock (&quot;Nuphar luteum&quot;). Although the floodplains in the region share much in common with one another, each river varies with some unique elements and plant species. The Trinity River basin in particular stands out in contrast to others with calcareous, relatively high pH, alkaline soils supporting vegetation that is seldom seen in other watersheds, including bois d&#x27;arc also called horse apple (&quot;Maclura pomifera&quot;), blueberry hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus brachyacantha&quot;), cedar elm (&quot;Ulmus crassifolia&quot;), and Texas sugarberry (&quot;Celtis laevigata&quot;).

Baygalls (aka: bay-gallberry holly bogs &quot;in part&quot;; Acid bog baygalls): With dense undergrowth and twisted vines growing in stagnant, blackwater, acid bogs, under a shadowy canopy of swamp tupelo and cypress, baygalls are often said to exemplify and epitomize the Big Thicket. Baygalls typically form at the base of slopes where seeps, springs, and rainwater drain onto the margins of the flat floodplains and bottomlands, away from the main channels. The drainage from the slopes maintain saturated, muddy soils in these already damp and humid areas, where pools, bogs, and stagnant drainages form in depressions on the flat landscape. With sphagnum mosses and high peat content, baygall soils and water have very high acidity, pH levels of 4.5 are common. The high acid levels are a significant factor in distinguishing baygalls from the floodplain and flats ecosystems. Although baygall waters are generally shallow and torpid, they sometimes form small, highly acidic blackwater streams, slowly moving into the larger creeks and bayous. Hanging bogs occur where water pools on irregular flat and low areas on the slopes above the bottomlands. The name baygall is derived from sweetbay magnolia (&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;) and sweet gallberry holly (&quot;Ilex coriacea&quot;). These and swamp titi (&quot;Cyrilla racemiflora&quot;) are dominant and other common shrubs include southern bayberry (&quot;Myrica cerifera&quot;), water willow (&quot;Decodon verticillatus&quot;), red bay (&quot;Persea borbonia&quot;), and Virginia sweetspire (&quot;Itea virginica&quot;). Vines like muscadine grape (&quot;Vitis rotundifolia&quot;), supplejack or rattan-vine (&quot;Berchemia scandens&quot;) can grow impressively large. Larger trees include swamp tupelo (&quot;Nyssa biflora&quot;) and bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;). In addition to the prominent fragrant water-lily (&quot;Nymphaea odorata&quot;), baygalls harbor many small and obscure wildflowers such as four species of carnivorous bladderworts (&quot;Utricularia&quot;), and saprophytic species like burmannia (Burmannia biflora) and nodding-nixie (&quot;Apteria aphylla&quot;). Some baygalls and hanging bogs are no more than a small pool, while others can be a mile across. One author states that the Jack Gore Baygall Unit of the BTNP, at 12 square miles, is the largest baygall in the world.

Flats (aka: palmetto-oak flats; wet forests; palmetto-hardwood flats): Dense stands of dwarf palmettos (&quot;Sabal minor&quot;) are an indicator of this ecosystem and it can have an exotic and tropical look with epiphytes draping from the trees, like Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;) and resurrection fern (&quot;Pleopeltis polypodioides&quot;). Some of the most extensive and well preserved palmetto-oak flats are found around Pine Island Bayou and Little Pine Island Bayou, the area known as the &quot;Traditional Thicket&quot; or &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Thicket&quot;. Flats, often several miles wide, are old river channels and floodplains and their associated bars and levees, filled with centuries of sediments and alluvium deposits. They are some of the flattest and lowest areas in the Big Thicket. Flats are typically poorly drained areas with very deep calcareous soils of a high clay content having vertisols properties, meaning the soil moves, shrinking and swelling with moisture content. Palmetto-oak flats alternate between flooded and dry conditions, with a few inches of water standing for days, weeks, even months after rains, to dry periods in which the soils dry, leaving large and deep cracks in the hard baked surface. The canopy is made up of several hardwoods species of which the swamp chestnut oak or basket oak (&quot;Quercus michauxii&quot;), laurel oak (&quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot;), overcup oak (&quot;Quercus lyrata&quot;), swamp post oak (&quot;Quercus similis&quot;), and cedar elm (&quot;Ulmus crassifolia&quot;) are dominant species. Other trees and shrubs filling in the canopy and understory include sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), Carolina ash (&quot;Fraxinus caroliniana&quot;), blueberry hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus brachiacanthua&quot;), and arrowwood viburnum (&quot;Viburnum dentatum&quot;). The shade of the canopy and the severity of the wet and dry conditions limit the species that grow in the understory. However the dwarf palmetto (&quot;Sabal minor&quot;) thrives, typically growing to about , although occasional specimens can be found up to tall. Some regard the larger specimens as a different species or variety, the Louisiana palmetto (&quot;Sabal louisiana&quot;), others do not recognize it a valid species. Other understory species found on the flats are creeping spot-flower (&quot;Spilanthes americana&quot;), Missouri ironweed (&quot;Vernonia missurica&quot;), lance-leaved water-willow (&quot;Justicia lanceolata&quot;), and inland sea oats (&quot;Chasmanthium latifolium&quot;). The ancient levees and bars deposited along the old river channels, varying in size from less than an acre up to , are slightly higher with better drainage supporting stands of loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;) and water oak (&quot;Quercus nigra&quot;) with understory species such as Hooker eryngo (&quot;Eryngium hookeri&quot;), and sharp-sepal penstemon (&quot;Penstemon tenuis&quot;). Bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and water tupelo (&quot;Nyssa aquatica&quot;) grow in and near permanent or semi permanent water and the disc water-hyssop (&quot;Bacopa rotundifolia&quot;) may be found floating or growing at the water&#x27;s edge. Drainage patterns are significant in shaping and maintaining these ecosystems and drainage alterations have reduced the historical size of this community.

Cypress slough (aka: sweet gum - oak floodplains &quot;in part&quot;; swamp-cypress tupelo forest; slough, oxbows, and cypress-tupelo swamps): Recognized as a distinct ecosystem by some, regarded as a component found within the flats, floodplains, and baygall bogs by others, cypress sloughs with older bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and their buttresses and protruding knees are impressive environments. Cypress sloughs occupy low laying areas in the floodplains of creeks and rivers set back from the main channels, with still or very slow moving permanent, or semi permanent, water, like secondary channels, ox-bow lakes, sloughs, and ponds. Cypress sloughs are found throughout the region but, are perhaps more extensive in the low laying south. The dominant trees are the bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and the water tupelo (&quot;Nyssa aquatica&quot;). Water tupelo often grow in deeper water and bald cypress in shallower parts or at the periphery, although both are adapted to growing in permanently submerged areas or on dry land with sufficient moisture. Understory trees and shrubs found growing around cypress sloughs include water or Carolina ash (&quot;Fraxinus caroliniana&quot;), water elm (&quot;Planera aquatica&quot;), river birch (&quot;Betula nigra&quot;), eastern hop-hornbean (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;), and buttonbush (&quot;Cephalanthus occidentalis&quot;). Plants like lizard&#x27;s tail (&quot;Saururus cernuus&quot;) and burhead (&quot;Echinodorus cordifolius&quot;) can be seen growing in shallow water with cardinal flower (&quot;Lobelia cardinalis&quot;) and sensitive fern (&quot;Onoclea sensibilis&quot;) at the water&#x27;s edge. Bald cypress trees typically live for 600 years or more and some are known to have lived 1,200 years. Cypress is a valuable hardwood, particularly prized for its resistance to rot and highly valued for shipbuilding, docks, and bridges. Consequently, this ancient swamp forest, once common in the region, have been greatly reduced because of logging in the nineteenth century. Trees over 100 years old are rare in the area now.

Mixed-grass prairies: Prairies (small patches are sometimes called coves), are sometimes included as a Big Thicket ecosystem. These are isolated fragments of coastal prairie more typical of Chambers and Jefferson counties to the south, in areas mostly found where the forest and coastal prairies transition. Prairies are dominated by grasses and herbaceous plants, some are the same as those found longleaf pine savannas, but others are distinctive like Indian grass (&quot;Sorghastrum nutans&quot;) and prairie bluebell (&quot;Eustoma grandiflorum&quot;). Common grasses of these areas include Indian grass (&quot;Sorghastrum avenaceum&quot;), eastern gama-grass (&quot;Tripsacum dactyloides&quot;), and tall dropseed (&quot;Sporobolus asper&quot;). One author distinguished prairies from longleaf pine savannas by the presence of pimple mounds or mima mounds. Prairies and coves were once found in the Big Thicket with some consistency, particularly in higher elevations in the south, and specifically in higher southwestern areas between the Pine Island Bayou and the Trinity River drainages. However, natural wildfires are an important factor in maintaining these areas and when fire is suppressed, trees and shrubs quickly grow in and fill in these areas. The Chinese tallow tree (&quot;Triadica sebifera&quot;) is a particularly aggressive and problematic invasive species in prairie habitat in the region. Prairies are also often the first areas to be developed for farming and residential housing. Unfortunately, prairies in the Big Thicket are now rare.

Roadsides and river edge: Although not a natural or even stable plant assemblage, some have recognized roadsides as an ecosystem in the Big Thicket. Proponents of the concept have identified a number of distinguishing characteristics of roadsides from the other ecosystems. Sunlight and heat can reach the ground along the clear highway easements, unlike most areas where the light is filtered by the forest canopy before it reaches the ground. Roadsides receive more rainwater, diverted from the pavement and often retained for a time in roadside ditches. Soil types not normally found at the surface are often exposed with the construction of roads, particularly deep road cuts in the low hills in the north that expose calcareous soils or where the formations are thin near transition zones supporting the growth of plants not normally occurring in the surrounding habitat, allowing for more diverse plants species to grow. The &quot;corridor effect&quot; of traffic, both human (vehicles, tourists, and road crews) and birds and other animals, inadvertently dispersing seeds and roots along roadsides from other areas. And finally, regular cycles of mowing and cutting, as well as the use of herbicides can both inhibit and benefit various wildflowers and plant species growing there. Most plant species at any given roadside represent the association immediately adjacent to that locality, but often have a few odd of species from other areas. Roadsides are a convenient and accessible places to view wildflowers, regardless of whether they are true ecosystems. In the past some (including the National Park Service) have discussed the river edge as an ecosystem in the Big Thicket however, most ecologist do not recognize river edges as an ecosystem distinct from the one a river runs through.

Exact numbers of plant and animal species occurring in the Big Thicket region are difficult to state objectively due to a number of factors including: the imprecise boundaries of the area; which (if any) accidental and vagrant species to count; whether to count extinct and extirpated species; whether to count introduced and invasive species; migratory vs. resident species; frequent taxonomic changes and taxonomic instability. These and other factors all contribute to what sometimes appear as inconsistent or contradictory counts and numbers.

=== Flora ===
The area contains over 100 species of trees and shrubs, with longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) once dominating the region. Big Thicket National Preserve has introduced programs to re-establish this dominance, including one of the US&#x27;s most active prescribed burn programs. With the National Park Service&#x27;s centennial occurring in 2016, efforts were made to plant between 100,000 and 300,000 longleaf pines. The National Park Service lists more than one thousand species of flowering plants and ferns that can also be found in the thicket, including 20 orchids and four types of carnivorous plants.


===Fauna===
During the last glacial period, plant and animal species from many different biomes moved into the area. Before their extinction, the Big Thicket was home to most species of North American megafauna.

Well over 500 species of vertebrates occur in the Big Thicket region, including more than 50 mammals, 300 birds, 60 reptiles, 30 amphibians, and over 90 fishes. The records and numbers below for mammals, reptiles, and amphibians are based on county records for Hardin, Jasper, Liberty, Montgomery, Polk, San Jacinto, Tyler, and Walker counties, which in a few cases may reflect marginal, peripheral, and vagrant records for a given species in the region and not all of the species are ubiquitous or evenly distributed throughout the Big Thicket.

Mammals: About 54 species of mammals occur in the Big Thicket (not counting extirpated species), including such species as the Virginia opossum (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina carolinensis&quot;), American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;), Baird&#x27;s pocket gopher (&quot;Geomys breviceps&quot;), southern flying squirrel (&quot;Glaucomys volans&quot;), white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), eastern spotted skunk (&quot;Spilogale putorius&quot;), American mink (&quot;Mustela vison&quot;), river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), gray fox (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), and Rafinesque&#x27;s big-eared bat (&quot;Corynorhinus rafinesquii&quot;) a threatened species in Texas. Although many of these species are common, they can be highly secretive and are seldom seen in the dense woodlands. Many prominent species that once occurred in the Big Thicket have been extirpated from their historical ranges. Examples include hog-nosed skunks (&quot;Conepatus leuconotus&quot;), red wolves (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;), ocelots (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;), and jaguars (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;). In 1902 ornithologist Harry Church Oberholser reported what he considered reliable accounts of jaguars in east Texas, including one killed south of Jasper a few years earlier, along the Neches River near Beaumont, and in the timber south of Conroe.

Although once common in the Big Thicket, the American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) was the target of a concerted effort to extirpate them from east Texas in the late nineteenth century. Reports of field naturalists in 1902 indicated: 
*Conroe: &quot;A few still found in the big thicket 15 mile south of here.&quot;
*Beaumont: &quot;A few still found in the forest northwest of here.&quot;
*Sour Lake: &quot;Still common in the swamps near here; a few killed every year.&quot;
*Rockland: &quot;Now very rare or quite extinct.&quot; 
Vernon Bailey, chief naturalist for the U.S. Biological Survey, interviewed a hog farmer and bear hunter named Ab Carter in 1904. Carter reported that in 1883, he and a neighbor set out to exterminate the bears in the Tarkington Prairie area of Liberty County that preyed on their free ranging hogs in the forest. That same year 182 bears were killed within a radius of Tarkington Prairie and annual hunting continued until 1900 when the last two bears were killed in that area. Currently, extremely rare bear sightings in east Texas are believed to be wandering individuals from reintroduction efforts in adjacent areas of Louisiana. They are now a threatened species in Texas and the National Park Service list them as &quot;probably present&quot;.

Conversely other species have been introduced to the area like the nutria (&quot;Myocastor coypus&quot;) from South America, now common in the area. Feral pigs (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) &quot;constitute one of the most serious conservation threats in Texas.&quot; They prey on natural populations of invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, ground nesting birds, and rodents and are known to play a role in the transmission of disease including brucellosis, pseudorabies, and swine fever. Their forging habits involve rooting up and disturbing soils, reducing both the numbers of individual plants and animals and the number species in any given area.

Birds: Three hundred species of migratory and nesting birds occur in the Big Thicket including the red-cockaded woodpecker, a state and federal endangered species. The extinct ivory-billed woodpecker once occurred in the Big Thicket.

Reptiles: Sixty-one species of reptiles are known from the Big Thicket area including the alligator, 15 turtles, 12 lizards, and 33 snakes. Along with birds, reptiles are among the more commonly seen wildlife and they are an important part of the forest community or ecosystems. The American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), although somewhat uncommon, occurs throughout the Big Thicket where sufficient water is found. However, alligators are abundant in the open marshland of Chambers and Jefferson counties to the south, where they bask in the sun unobstructed by forest trees.

Turtle diversity in the American Gulf Coast states is among the highest in the world. The red-eared slider (&quot;Trachemys scripta&quot;) is the most common of the pond and river turtles, although river cooters (&quot;Pseudemys concinna&quot;), Mississippi map turtles (&quot;Graptemys pseudogeographica&quot;), Sabine map turtles (&quot;Graptemys sabinensis&quot;), and the rare chicken turtle (&quot;Deirochelys reticularia&quot;) all occur there. The worldwide distribution of the Sabine map turtle is limited to the Sabine and Neches rivers and adjacent drainages of southwest Louisiana. The once ubiquitous and abundant three-toed box turtle (&quot;Terrapene carolina&quot;) is still occasionally encountered in east Texas but its numbers plummeted in the late twentieth century, while the ornate box turtle (&quot;Terrapene ornata&quot;), at its eastern range limits, is known from a few county records in the area, as is the yellow mud turtle (&quot;Kinosternon flavescens&quot;). The Mississippi mud turtle (&quot;Kinosternon subrubrum&quot;), razorback musk turtle (&quot;Sternotherus carinatus&quot;), and common musk turtle (&quot;Sternotherus odoratus&quot;) spend much or their time foraging at the bottom of the murky waters but, occasionally can be seen basking or even on land moving between streams and ponds. Powerful swimmers, the largely aquatic spiny soft-shelled turtle (&quot;Apalone spinifera&quot;) is found throughout the region, while the smooth soft-shelled turtle (&quot;Apalone mutica&quot;) prefers the larger rivers, creeks, and bayous. The snapping turtle family (Chelydridae) is found only in the New World with two genera, both represented in the Big Thicket, the common snapping turtle (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;) and the alligator snapping turtle (&quot;Macrochelys temminckii&quot;). The alligator snapping turtle is the largest freshwater turtle in North America and one of the larger freshwater turtles in the world. One record sized individual with a shell has been documented, and another captive specimen recorded, however, and is the typical adult size. Alligator snapping turtles are protected as a threatened species in Texas.

Lizards commonly seen include green anoles (&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;), five-lined skinks (&quot;Plestiodon fasciatus&quot;), broad-headed skinks &quot;(Plestiodon laticeps&quot;), ground skinks (&quot;Scincella lateralis&quot;), and prairie lizards (&quot;Sceloporus consobrinus&quot;). Six-lined race runners (&quot;Aspidoscelis sexlineatus&quot;) are not uncommon, but limited to open areas with sandy soils, whereas the legless western slender glass lizard (&quot;Ophisaurus attenuatus&quot;) prefers areas of dense grasses with sandy soils. Three lizards barely range into peripheral counties, including two rare skinks, the southern prairie skink (&quot;Plestiodon septentrionalis&quot;) in the west and the coal skink (&quot;Plestiodon anthracinus&quot;) in the northeast; and the Texas spiny lizard (&quot;Sceloporus olivaceus&quot;), common to the west, but rare in a few western Big Thicket counties. Most records of the state reptile, the Texas horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;), from east Texas are from the early and mid-twentieth century when they were popular pets, and are thought to represent released or escaped pets and not the species natural range. Two invasive species, the brown anole (&quot;Anolis sagrei&quot;) and the nocturnal Mediterranean gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus turcicus&quot;), are found there.

Snakes: With 33 species, the highest diversity among the reptiles are the snakes. Some of the more common species include the eastern hognose snake (&quot;Heterodon platirhinos&quot;), brown snake (&quot;Storeria dekayi&quot;), western ribbon snake (&quot;Thamnophis proximus&quot;), and the rough greensnake (&quot;Opheodrys aestivus&quot;). Two large, common, but harmless species, the coachwhip snake (&quot;Masticophis flagellum&quot;) and the Texas rat snake (&quot;Pantherophis obsoletus&quot;), both commonly grow to ; individuals are not rare, and they occasionally grow even larger. The North American racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;) occurs in three color variations in the Big Thicket, some recognize them as subspecies, the buttermilk racer (&quot;C. c. anthicus&quot;), the yellow-bellied racer (&quot;C. c. flaviventris&quot;), and the tan racer (&quot;C. c. etheridgei&quot;). The harmless watersnakes bear a resemblance and share habitats with venomous cottonmouths, including three common species, the yellow-bellied watersnake (&quot;Nerodia erythrogaster&quot;), southern or broad-banded watersnake (&quot;Nerodia fasciata&quot;), diamondback watersnake (&quot;Nerodia rhombifer&quot;), and the uncommon Mississippi green watersnake (&quot;Nerodia cyclopion&quot;). Some less common species that are occasionally encountered are the western mud snake (&quot;Farancia abacura&quot;), prairie kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis calligaster&quot;), speckled kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis holbrooki&quot;), Louisiana milk snake (&quot;Lampropeltis triangulum&quot;), and Slowinski&#x27;s cornsnake (&quot;Pantherophis slowinskii&quot;). The rare and endangered Louisiana pine snake (&quot;Pituophis ruthveni&quot;) is known form historical records in the Big Thicket but might be extirpated from the area now. The Louisiana pine snake is closely associated with the Baird&#x27;s pocket gopher (&quot;Geomys breviceps&quot;), both for prey and its burrows for shelter, and both species occupy longleaf pine uplands, savanna, and sandyland, habitat which is dependent on periodic cycles of wildfires to maintain an open understory.

There are five species of venomous snakes in the area. Two rattlesnakes, the pygmy rattlesnake (&quot;Sistrurus miliarius&quot;) and the canebrake or timber rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus horridus&quot;) are both uncommon to rare. Timber rattlesnakes are a threatened species in Texas, as they are in most states where they occur and are protected by state laws. The Texas coral snake (&quot;Micrurus tener&quot;) is not uncommon however, they are secretive, often fossorial, and seldom seen. Two of the most common snakes, venomous or non-venomous, are the copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix&quot;) and cottonmouth (&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot;). Venomous snakes deserve caution and respect, but are safely observed when distances of 15–20 feet are maintained.

Amphibians: There are 31 species of amphibians found in the Big Thicket area, including 11 species of salamanders and 20 species of frogs and toads. Some of the more commonly encountered salamanders in the region include the smallmouth salamander (&quot;Ambystoma texanum&quot;), dwarf salamander (&quot;Eurycea quadridigitata&quot;), and central newt (&quot;Notophthalmus viridescens&quot;). The three-toed amphiuma (&quot;Amphiuma tridactylum&quot;) is one of the larger salamanders in the world and can grow over . Three salamanders, including the three-toed amphiuma (&quot;Amphiuma tridactylum&quot;), Gulf Coast water dog (&quot;Necturus beyeri&quot;), and lesser siren (&quot;Siren intermedia&quot;), retain their gills from the larva stage and live their entire lives in the muddy waters of east Texas and consequently, although not rare, are seldom seen except by an occasional fisherman or those who specifically go look for them. Likewise, mole salamanders (members of the genus &quot;Ambystoma&quot;), including the spotted salamander (&quot;Ambystoma maculatum&quot;), marbled salamander (&quot;Ambystoma opacum&quot;), mole salamander (&quot;Ambystoma talpoideum&quot;), and tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;) spend much of their lives underground and are infrequently seen except for few short weeks each year during their breeding seasons. The southern dusky salamander (&quot;Desmognathus auriculatus&quot;), once widespread in Southeast Texas, now appears to be in serious decline.

Common toads and frogs include the Gulf Coast toad (&quot;Incilius nebulifer&quot;), Blanchard&#x27;s cricket frog (&quot;Acris blanchardi&quot;), green tree frog (&quot;Hyla cinerea&quot;), squirrel tree frog (&quot;Hyla squirella&quot;), spring peeper (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;), eastern narrow-mouth toad (&quot;Gastrophryne carolinensis&quot;), American bullfrog (&quot;Lithobates catesbeianus&quot;), bronze frog (&quot;Lithobates clamitans&quot;), and southern leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates sphenocephalus&quot;). Two other frequently encountered tree frogs, Cope&#x27;s gray tree frog (&quot;Hyla chrysoscelis&quot;) and the gray tree frog (&quot;Hyla versicolor&quot;), are identical in appearance and can only be distinguished by subtle differences in their calls or by laboratory analysis. The East Texas toad, commonly seen in the Big Thicket, has been controversial among herpetologist and taxonomist, some arguing that it is a distinct species (&quot;Anaxyrus velatus&quot;) while others argue that it is a hybrid between Woodhouse&#x27;s toad (&quot;Anaxyrus woodhousii&quot;) found to the west and Fowler&#x27;s toad (&quot;Anaxyrus fowleri&quot;) found to the east. Two rare and highly secretive frogs are the pickerel frog (&quot;Lithobates palustris&quot;) and the southern crawfish frog (&quot;Lithobates areolatus&quot;) which is a fossorial species, spending much of its time in crayfish burrows and other small cavities in the ground. One invasive species, the small Rio Grande chirping frog (&quot;Syrrhophus cystignathoides&quot;), is native to the Rio Grande Valley and Mexico but, it does not appear pose an ecological threat to other species as invasive species often do.

Fishes: Well over 90 species of fishes are known from the area. The Big Thicket National Preserve inventoried 92 species in the preserve&#x27;s waters and another 20 species are noted as possible occurrences. The National Park Service checklist includes 104 species. Others source note 98 species and 94 species. In the smaller tributaries the most abundant species are minnows, killifishes, darters, bass, and bullhead catfish, while larger creeks and bayous are dominated by channel, blue, and flathead catfish, sunfishes, largemouth and spotted bass, and crappie.

Insects: Studies have documented nearly 1,800 species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) in the Big Thicket.

Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata): Damselflies typically sit with their wings together, closed over their backs. Dragonflies sit with their wings spread. Collectively over 120 species occur in the Big Thicket area. They are often associated with water where they lay their eggs. Most species have preferences in the water they frequent, such as moving water vs. still water, streams, ponds, marshes etc. The Needham&#x27;s skimmer (&quot;Libellula needhami&quot;) lay their eggs in flight, while the ebony jewelwing (&quot;Calopteryx maculata&quot;) submerges for up to two hours while depositing eggs. The nymphs are aquatic. Both the larva and adults are fierce predators, feeding primarily on insects. They are frequently sexually dimorphic and males and females may have different colors and patterns. Some species like the roseate skimmer (&quot;Orthemis ferruginea&quot;) and common green darner (&quot;Anax junius&quot;) can be seen in their adult form year round. Others are limited to a few weeks or mouths each year like the calico pennant (&quot;Celithemis elisa&quot;) flying April - August and Needham&#x27;s skimmer (&quot;Libellula needhami&quot;) flying May - September. The Texas emerald (&quot;Somatochlora margarita&quot;) and the rare and sarracenia spiketail (&quot;Cordulegaster sarracenia&quot;) are endemic to southeast Texas and adjacent areas of Louisiana.

== History ==
In pre-Columbian times, people of the Caddoan Mississippian culture occupied areas just to the north of the Big Thicket region. The Atakapa-Ishak (including the subgroups Akiosa, Akokisas, Bidai, Deadoses, and Patiri) occupied the Big Thicket area, living nomadically along the Gulf of Mexico in Southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana. They left evidence of hunting camps and such, although the Big Thicket area itself does not appear to have been the site of any significant permanent settlements comparable to the Caddo mound builders to the north. The Atakapa-Ishak speaking people were largely decimated by European diseases in the late eighteenth century, with only a few descendants surviving today. About the same time as the collapse of the Atakapa-Ishak people, the Alabama-Coushatta, originally two closely associated tribes living in adjacent areas of Alabama, began a westward migration about 1763 due to the encroachment of Europeans. The Alabama-Coushatta settled into the northern sections of the Big Thicket area by 1780, prior to the acquisition of their reservation in 1854.

The Spaniards ruled the region 1521–1810, defining the Big Thicket&#x27;s boundaries with the north as El Camino Real de los Tejas (Old San Antonio Road), a trail from central Texas to Nacogdoches; in the south as the Atascosito Road running from southwest Louisiana to Southeast Texas; to the west by the Brazos River; and to the east by the Sabine River. The Spanish established a settlement called Atascosito on the Atascosito Road at the Trinity River in 1756, renamed Villa de la Santissima Trinidad de la Libertad (Village of the Most Holy Trinity of Liberty) in 1831, later shortened to Liberty. However, this was little more than an outpost on the road and a stop on the river and interior areas were not developed in colonial times. Likewise, Beaumont (Tevis Bluff) was established in 1826 and Fort Teran, a long abandoned site in Tyler County on the Neches River were both primarily stops for river traffic.

After Mexican independence (c. 1810–1836), the region remained largely undeveloped. One of the earliest European naturalists to survey Texas was Jean Louis Berlandier (1803–1851), a French naturalist who participated in a Mexican Boundary Survey from 1828 to 1829. Although Berlandier did not survey the Big Thicket area, he did travel to Robbins Crossing, where the El Camino Real (Old San Antonio Road) crossed the Trinity River and camped May 25–29, 1829, collecting information on the Trinity River among other things. Of the lower Trinity, Berlandier wrote in his journal &quot;Every year in May or June the water overflows its banks. These banks are covered with dense forest where one finds many nut trees [pecans], oaks, maples, elms, and pines. The banks are populated by various Indian nations of the United States of America, such as the Conchates [Coushatta], Kichais, and Kicapoos, who have established their village there. One also finds two villages of colonist, known as Trinidad and Atascosito, which have achieved some growth at the present time&quot;. Lorenzo de Zavala (1788–1836) received empresario land grants in 1829 and sought to interest capitalists in New York without success. In 1830, Zavala formed the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company in New York City with Joseph Vehlein and David G. Burnet (holding grants for in Texas) in hopes of colonizing the land, but they had minimal success. Stephen Jackson received in Hardin County, settling at Sour Lake Springs around 1835, the oldest extant town in the county. With Texas independence (1836), and the early years of statehood in the United States, Anglo-Saxon settlers began drifting into the area. Entrepreneurs bottled the water from the Sour Lake Springs and Jackson had developed a health resort with quality accommodations there by 1850. A Sour Lake post office was established in 1866 but discontinued in 1876. In the mid-nineteenth century the Big Thicket was sparsely populated by a few scattered inhabitants living in the woods off subsistence farming, hunting, and running free range hogs and cattle. It also had a reputation as a place for those avoiding conscription in the Confederate Army, Jayhawkers, outlaws, and such.
The 1860 census showed there were about 200 sawmills statewide, but most were located near the Gulf Coast or north of the Big Thicket. Compared to other states, lumber production in Texas was small. As late as 1870, the majority of the forest of East Texas remained untouched. However that soon changed as the &quot;bonanza era&quot; (c. 1880–1930) of Texas lumbering began, facilitated by a rapidly developed railroad system. In 1877 Henry J. Lutcher and G. Bedell Moore started the first major mill in Orange, Texas. Others followed, many building company towns in remote areas, where employees were often at the mercy of their employers. In the midst of the lumbering activity, oil was discovered at Spindletop in January 1901, just south of the Big Thicket. The frenzy of activity that followed saw rampant drilling and exploration, the founding of Gulf Oil, Humble, and Texaco, and a rapid growth in population, development, and infrastructure. The population of Hardin County went from 1,870 in 1880 to 15,983 in 1920 according to the Census Bureau. John Henry Kirby &quot;Prince of the Pines&quot;, started the Kirby Lumber Company about 1900 which ultimately held mineral and timber rights to a million acres in the region. By the 1920s East Texas timber was nearing depletion and most of the operations practiced a cut-out and get-out policy and moved on, many to the Pacific coast, leaving vast areas of clear-cut forest behind. The Great Depression marked the end of the bonanza era for lumbering in East Texas. The population of Hardin County dropped to 13.936 (12.8%) in the 1930 census. Many of the towns in the Big Thicket emerged during this time in support of the lumber industry, as evidenced by names like Lumberton established in the 1890s, Kirbyville (1895) was named after John Kirby: Silsbee, (1894), was named for Nathan D. Silsbee an east coast investor in the railroads, others include Kountze (1882), Camden (1889), and Diboll (1894).
William Goodrich Jones (1860–1950), &quot;the father of Texas forestry&quot; was a bank president and civic leader in Temple, Texas. He had some exposure to good forestry practices in Germany and understood the commercial benefits of well-managed forests and he was appalled with what he saw in East Texas. He was not a conservationist, he advocated for sustainable forestry methods as a good business practice, including reforestation, maintaining soils, grasses, wildlife, and establishing parks. In 1898 the United States Bureau of Forestry asked Jones to write a report on the status of forestry in Texas. Jones condemn the destructive and wastefulness of the logging industry and predicted the forest would be gone in 25 years without changes. He recommended state and federal regulations with sustainable harvest and reforestation programs. In 1914 Jones formed the Texas Forestry Association with public officials, lumbermen, and conservationists. In collaboration with the United States Forest Service, the Texas Forestry Association drafted legislation to establish the Texas Department of Forestry, which, in 1926, became the Texas Forest Service.

What came to be a 50-year struggle to protect a portion of the Big Thicket for posterity begin in 1927 when R. E. Jackson, a railroad conductor, formed the East Texas Big Thicket Association (ETBTA) which sought to preserve . With Don Baird, of the Texas Academy of Science, the ETBTA instigated a biological survey that was conducted by Hal B. Parks and Victor L. Cory in 1936 defining the Big Thicket as a area of East Texas. With this survey and growing support of newspapers and the scientific community, the ETBTA lobbied the government for a national park. However, four national forests had recently been established in East Texas, more oil was discovered in Polk County, there was resistance from the lumber industry, and World War II brought an increased demand for lumber, all undermining their efforts. By the 1950s, the ETBTA existed primarily on paper and eventually expired. However the idea did not die. A new Big Thicket Association was founded in 1964 by Lance Rosier and continued pushing for protected land and the governor appointed Dempsie Henley to head a proposal for a state park. However, with changing officials in state elections, lackadaisical attitudes, opposition from timber firms, and several attempts without success, Henley enlisted the aid of U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough in 1965. Yarborough was enthusiastic and introduced a bill to establish a national park in 1966. Claude McLeod, a biologist at Sam Houston State College, had been studying the Big Thicket for several years and completed a manuscript about the time a National Park survey team arrived in 1966 to develop the proposal. McLeod&#x27;s research, which mapped over acres across nine counties, was used as the basis for the National Park&#x27;s report. It was only after seven years and another 27 Big Thicket bills were introduced in Congress, both pro and con, that a resolution was reached. Congress passed the Big Thicket National Preserve legislation in 1974 which was finally signed by President Gerald Ford.

==Protected and public land==
The headquarters of Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) are located north of Kountze, Texas, and approximately north of Beaumont via US 69/287. It is administered by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. It consists of nine separate land units as well as six water corridors and as of October 22, 2019, the preserve includes spread over seven counties. Centered about Hardin County, Texas, the BTNP extends into parts of surrounding Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Orange, Polk, and Tyler counties. It was established in 1974 in an attempt to protect the many plant and animal species within. Along with Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida, the BTNP became the first national preserve in the United States National Park System when both were authorized by the United States Congress on October 11, 1974. Senator Ralph Yarborough was its most powerful proponent in Congress and the bill was proposed by Charles Wilson and Bob Eckhardt that established the preserve. The BTNP was also designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1981. National preserves differ from national parks in that some public hunting, trapping, oil/gas exploration and extraction are permitted.

==Ghost Road==

A dirt road leading north out of the town of Saratoga is the core of the area&#x27;s predominant ghost story. Bragg Road, as it is more formally known, was constructed in 1934 on the bed of a former railroad line that had serviced the lumber industry. In the 1940s, stories began to circulate about a mysterious light, sometimes referred to as the Light of Saratoga, that could be seen on and near the road at night. No adequate explanation of the light has been offered. The various ghost stories include reference to the Kaiser Burnout, long-dead conquistadors looking for their buried treasure, a decapitated railroad worker, and a lost night hunter eternally searching for a way out. Less paranormal explanations include swamp gas, and automobile headlights filtering through the trees.

<text>The Atfalati , also known as the Tualatin or Wapato Lake Indians are a tribe of the Kalapuya Native Americans who originally inhabited and continue to steward some 24 villages on the Tualatin Plains in the northwest part of the U.S. state of Oregon; the Atfalati also live in the hills around Forest Grove, along Wapato Lake and the north fork of the Yamhill River, and into areas of Southern Portland.

The Atfalati speak the Tualatin-Yamhill (Northern Kalapuya) language, which is one of the three Kalapuyan languages.

==History and culture==
Atfalati people ranged around the valley, engaged in a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Primary food stuffs included deer, camas root, fish, berries, elk, and various nuts. To encourage the growth of the camas plant and maintain habitat beneficial to deer and elk, the group burned the valley floor to discourage the growth of forests, a common practice among the Kalapuya.

Before Euro-American contact, the Atfalati were known for wearing adornment such a red feathers on the head. Both men and women had pierced earlobes and noses, hanging long beads and bright dentalia from them. Compared to the peoples to the south, the Atfalati practiced a more severe form of infant head flattening, and compared to the peoples to the east of the Cascade Mountains raised fewer horses. The Atfalati kept slaves, who could sometimes purchase their freedom with horses. The Atfalati lived in rectangular multi-family houses.

Euro-Americans began arriving in the Atfalati&#x27;s homeland in the early 19th century, and settlers in the 1840s. As with the other Kalapuyan peoples, the arrival of Euro-Americans led to dramatic social disruptions. By the 1830s the Atfalati had already begun to adopt Euro-American clothing styles. In the 1830s, diseases had decimated Native populations in the Pacific Northwest, including the Atfalati. The tribe had already experienced population decreased from smallpox epidemics in 1782 and 1783. These upheavals diminished the Atfalati&#x27;s ability to challenge white encroachment. It is estimated that the band was reduced to a population of around 600 in 1842, and had shrunk to only 60 in 1848.

By the 1850s, white settlers were rapidly populating the Willamette Valley, and the United States government (represented by Anson Dart, superintendent for Indian affairs in the Oregon Territory) negotiated treaties in 1851 with the Kalapuyans, including the Atfalati. Under the terms of a treaty of April 19, 1851, the Atfalatis ceded their lands in return for a small reservation at Wapato Lake as well as &quot;money, clothing, blankets, tools, a few rifles, and a horse for each of their headmen--Kiacut, La Medicine, and Knolah.&quot; At the time of the treaty, there were 65 Atfalatis. The treaty resulted in the loss of much of the Atfalati&#x27;s lands, but was preferable to removal east of the Cascade Mountains, which the government initially had demanded. This treaty, however, was never ratified.

Under continuing pressure, the government and Kalapuya renegotiated a treaty with Joel Palmer, Dart&#x27;s successor. This treaty, the Treaty with the Kalapuya, etc. (also known as the Willamette Valley Treaty or Dayton Treaty) was signed January 4, 1855, and ratified by Congress, on March 3, 1855 (10 Stat. 1143). Under the terms of the treaty, the indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley agreed to remove to a reservation to be designated by the federal government. The government later designated the Grand Ronde reservation in the western part of the Willamette Valley at the foothills of the Oregon Coast Range as the permanent reservation for a variety of tribes.

Following this, the Atfalati tribe declined; the 1870 census showed 60 members living at the Grand Ronde reservation and the 1910 Census showed only 44; a 1914 Smithsonian Institution publication listed a single survivor living on the Yakima Reservation in Washington. The degree to which the Atfalati assimilated with whites over time is not known.

<text>René-Charles &quot;Zino&quot; Francescatti (9 August 1902 – 17 September 1991) was a French virtuoso violinist, renowned for his lyrical playing style.

==Career==
René-Charles &quot;Zino&quot; Francescatti was born in Marseilles, to a musical family. Both parents were violinists. His father, who also played the cello, had studied with Camillo Sivori. Zino studied violin from age three and was quickly recognized as a child prodigy. He began performing at the age of five and made his debut at age 10, playing Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto. 

In 1925, he made his Paris debut with Paganini&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, and in 1927 he joined the faculty of the École Normale de Musique; he also conducted the Concerts Poulets. He made his first world tour in 1931 and his American debut with Sir John Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic in 1939, again playing Paganini&#x27;s Violin Concerto. For three decades after 1945 he had an exceptionally impressive international career, living in the United States and France.

A violinist of outstanding technical ability, Francescatti played all of the great concerti. His performances of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor, Saint-Saëns&#x27; Violin Concerto No. 3, Max Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1, and others, continue to be well-regarded.

Francescatti made many renowned LPs, including a set of the complete Beethoven violin-piano sonatas with Robert Casadesus, a frequent musical collaborator of his. Both in concerts and on disc, he performed on the celebrated &quot;Hart&quot; Stradivarius of 1727. Francescatti was also very active as an editor of classical repertoire for International Music Company, which continues to publish his work. Upon his retirement in 1976, he sold the instrument and established the Zino Francescatti Foundation to assist young violinists in La Ciotat. In 1987, an international violin competition was organized in his honor in Aix-en-Provence.

He died in La Ciotat, aged 89.

<text>Yazoo Records is an American record label founded in the mid-1960s by Nick Perls. It specializes in early American blues, country, jazz, and other rural American genres collectively known as roots music.

==History==

The first five releases (L 1001 to L 1005) were issued under the label name of Belzona Records. The label was then renamed Yazoo Records, and the first five releases were reissued under the new name.

The Belzona and Yazoo labels featured an Art Deco drawing of a peacock, adapted from the 1927 label of Black Patti Records.

For Yazoo Records Perls compiled rare 78-rpm recordings made in the 1920s by musicians such as Charley Patton, Blind Willie McTell, the Memphis Jug Band, Blind Blake, and Blind Lemon Jefferson. Perls founded a second label, Blue Goose Records, in 1970, for which he recorded &quot;rediscovered&quot; black blues artists and younger blues and jazz performers.

In 1987 Yazoo was acquired by Shanachie Records. In 2014, Yazoo signed its first current artists, The Reverend Peyton&#x27;s Big Damn Band and released their album &quot;So Delicious&quot; on February 17, 2015.

<text>The rock hyrax (; Procavia capensis), also called dassie, Cape hyrax, rock rabbit, and (from some interpretations of a word used in the King James Bible) coney, is a medium-sized terrestrial mammal native to Africa and the Middle East. Commonly referred to in South Africa as the dassie (; ), it is one of the five living species of the order Hyracoidea, and the only one in the genus &quot;Procavia&quot;.
Rock hyraxes weigh and have short ears.

Rock hyraxes are found at elevations up to above sea level in habitats with rock crevices, allowing them to escape from predators. They are the only extant terrestrial afrotherians in the Middle East. Hyraxes typically live in groups of 10–80 animals, and forage as a group. They have been reported to use sentries to warn of the approach of predators. Having incomplete thermoregulation, they are most active in the morning and evening, although their activity pattern varies substantially with season and climate.

Over most of its range, the rock hyrax is not endangered, and in some areas is considered a minor pest.
Along with other hyrax species and the sirenians, this species is the most closely related to the elephant. An unrelated, convergently evolved mammal of similar habits and appearance is the rock cavy of Brazil.

==Characteristics==
Rock hyraxes are squat and heavily built, with adults reaching a length of and weighing around , with a slight sexual dimorphism, males being about 10% heavier than females. Their fur is thick and grey-brown, although this varies strongly between different environments, from dark brown in wetter habitats, to light gray in desert-living individuals. Hyrax size (as measured by skull length and humerus diameter) is correlated to precipitation, probably because of the effect on preferred hyrax forage.

Prominent in and apparently unique to hyraxes is the dorsal gland, which excretes an odour used for social communication and territorial marking. The gland is most clearly visible in dominant males.

The rock hyrax has a pointed head, short neck, and rounded ears. It has long, black whiskers on its muzzle. The rock hyrax has a prominent pair of long, pointed tusk-like upper incisors, which are reminiscent of the elephant, to which the hyrax is distantly related. The fore feet are plantigrade, and the hind feet are semi-digitigrade. The soles of the feet have large, soft pads that are kept moist with sweat-like secretions. In males, the testes are permanently abdominal, another anatomical feature that hyraxes share with elephants and sirenians.

Thermoregulation in rock hyraxes has been subject to much research, as their body temperature varies with a diurnal rhythm. Animals kept in constant environmental conditions also display such variation, and this internal mechanism may be related to water balance regulation.

==Distribution and geographic variation==
The rock hyrax occurs widely across sub-Saharan Africa in disjunct northern and southern populations; it is absent from the Congo Basin and Madagascar. The distribution encompasses southern Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and the Middle East, with populations in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Arabian Peninsula. The northern subspecies was introduced to Jebel Hafeet, which is on the border of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

The shade of their pelts varies individually and regionally. In particular, the dorsal patches (present in both sexes) of the central populations are very variable, ranging from yellow to black, or flecked. In outlying populations, these are more constant in colour, black in &quot;P. c. capensis&quot;, cream in &quot;P. c. welwitschii&quot;, and orange in &quot;P. c. ruficeps&quot;. A larger, longer-haired population is abundant in the moraines in the alpine zone of Mount Kenya.

===Subspecies===
The subspecies, which are sometimes elevated to full species, are:

* &quot;P. c. capensis&quot; – Cape rock hyrax, native to South Africa and Namibia

* &quot;P. c. habessinicus&quot; – Ethiopian rock hyrax, native to northeastern Africa and Arabia

* &quot;P. c. johnstoni&quot; – black-necked rock hyrax, native to central and East Africa

* &quot;P. c. ruficeps&quot; – red-headed rock hyrax, native to the southern Sahara
* &quot;P. c. welwitschii&quot; – Kaokoveld rock hyrax, native to the Kaokoveld of Namibia

==Ecology and behavior==
Rock hyraxes build dwelling holes in any type of rock with suitable cavities, such as sedimentary rocks and soil.
In Mount Kenya, rock hyraxes live in colonies comprising an adult male, several adult females, and immatures. They are active during the day, and sometimes during moonlit nights. The dominant male defends and watches over the group. The male also marks his territory.

In Africa, hyraxes are preyed on by leopards, Egyptian cobras, puff adders, rock pythons, caracals, wild dogs, hawks, and owls. Verreaux&#x27;s eagle in particular is a specialist hunter of hyraxes. In Israel, the rock hyrax is reportedly rarely preyed upon by terrestrial predators, as their system of sentries and reliable refuges provides considerable protection. Hyrax remains are almost absent from the droppings of wolves in the Judean Desert.

===Feeding and foraging===

Hyraxes feed on a wide variety of plant species, including &quot;Lobelia&quot; and broad-leafed plants. They also have been reported to eat insects and grubs. They forage for food up to about 50 m from their refuge, usually feeding as a group and with one or more acting as sentries from a prominent lookout position. On the approach of danger, the sentries give an alarm call, and the animals quickly retreat to their refuge.

They are able to go for many days without water due to the moisture they obtain through their food, but quickly dehydrate under direct sunlight. Despite their seemingly clumsy build, they are able to climb trees (although not as readily as &quot;Heterohyrax&quot;), and readily enter residential gardens to feed on the leaves of citrus and other trees.

The rock hyrax also makes a loud, grunting sound while moving its jaws as if chewing, and this behaviour may be a sign of aggression. Some authors have proposed that observation of this behavior by ancient Israelites gave rise to the misconception given in Leviticus 11:4–8 that the hyrax chews the cud, but the hyrax is not a ruminant.

===Reproduction===

Rock hyraxes give birth to two to four young after a gestation period of 6–7 months (long, for their size). The young are well developed at birth with fully opened eyes and complete pelage. Young can ingest solid food after two weeks and are weaned at 10 weeks. After 16 months, they become sexually mature, they reach adult size at 3 years, and they typically live about 10 years. During seasonal changes, the weight of the male reproductive organs (testes, seminal vesicles) changes due to sexual activity. Between May and January in Cape Province, South Africa, the males are inactive sexually. From February onward, the weight of these organs increases dramatically and the males are able to copulate.

===Social behavior===

==== Group structure ====
Hyraxes that live in more &quot;egalitarian&quot; groups, in which social associations are spread more evenly among group members, survive longer. In addition, hyraxes are the first nonhuman species in which structural balance was described. They follow &quot;the friend of my friend is my friend&quot; rule, and avoid unbalanced social configurations. The balance of social interactions within a group is positively correlated to individual longevity, meaning that &quot;it is not the number or strength of associations that an adult individual has (i.e. centrality) that is important, but the overall configuration of social relationships within the group.&quot; The reason for such a balanced group configuration, rather than one that is centrally dominated by a few individual hyraxes, was suggested to have to do with the fact that information flow to all members is important in a fragmented habitat as that of the hyrax, making a dominance hierarchy a liability for the survival of the group at large.

==== Vocalisations ====
Captive rock hyraxes make more than 20 different noises and vocal signals. The most familiar one is a high trill, given in response to perceived danger. Rock hyrax calls can provide important biological information, such as size, age, social status, body weight, condition, and hormonal state of the caller, as determined by measuring their call length, patterns, complexity, and frequency. More recently, researchers have found rich syntactic structure and geographical variations in the calls of rock hyraxes, a first in the vocalization of mammalian taxa other than primates, cetaceans, and bats. Higher-ranked males tend to sing more often, and the energetic cost of singing is relatively low. A recent study found that snorts, a rare aspect of male hyrax songs, play an important signalling role as well, with increasing snort harshness being associated with &quot;the progression of inner excitement or aggression&quot;. It is also positively associated with the singing animal&#x27;s social status and testosterone levels. Singing has also been shown to be a marker of an individual hyrax&#x27;s unique identity, where identity is expressed by unique vocal signatures &quot;that are not condition dependent and are stable over years in singers that did not alter their spatial position.&quot;

==== Resting ====
The rock hyrax spends roughly 95% of its time resting. During this time, it can often be seen basking in the sun, which sometimes involves &quot;heaping&quot;, where several animals pile on top of each other. This is thought to be an element of its complex thermoregulation.

===Dispersal===
Male hyraxes have been categorised into four classes: territorial, peripheral, early dispersers, and late dispersers. The territorial males are dominant. Peripheral males are more solitary and sometimes take over a group when the dominant male is missing. Early-dispersing males are juveniles that leave the birth site around 16 to 24 months of age. Late dispersers are also juvenile males, but they leave the birth site much later, around 30 or more months of age.

==Names==
The species is known as in Afrikaans (etymology: rock + badger), while most people just call them &quot;dassies&quot; (the plural of dassie) or &quot;rock rabbits&quot; in South Africa. The Swahili names for them are , , and , though the latter two names are nowadays reserved for the tree hyraxes.
This species has many subspecies, many of which are also known as rock or Cape hyrax, although the former usually refers to African varieties.

In Arabic, the rock hyrax is called () or (&#x27;). In Hebrew, the rock hyrax is called (&#x27;), meaning rock &quot;shafan&quot;, where the meaning of &quot;shafan&quot; is obscure, but is colloquially used as a synonym for rabbit in modern Hebrew. According to Gerald Durrell, local people in Bafut, Cameroon, call the rock hyrax the &quot;n&#x27;eer&quot;.

==Naturopathic use==
Rock hyraxes produce large quantities of hyraceum, a sticky mass of dung and urine that has been employed as a South African folk remedy in the treatment of several medical disorders, including epilepsy and convulsions. Hyraceum is now being used by perfumers, who tincture it in alcohol to yield a natural animal musk.

==In culture==
The rock hyrax is classified as &quot;treif&quot; (not kosher; unclean) according to &quot;kashrut&quot; – Jewish food hygiene rules – due to statements in the Old Testament in Leviticus 11:5:
&quot;And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you&quot;. Hyraxes are also mentioned in Proverbs 30:26 as one of a number of remarkable animals for being small but exceedingly wise, in this case because &quot;the conies are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs&quot;.

In Joy Adamson&#x27;s books and the film &quot;Born Free&quot;, a rock hyrax called Pati-Pati was her companion for six years before Elsa and her siblings came along; Pati-Pati reportedly took the role of nanny and watched over them with great care.

The 2013 animated film &quot;Khumba&quot; features a number of rock hyraxes that sacrifice one of their own to a white Verreaux&#x27;s eagle.

<doc id="1239399" wikidata="Q549617" url="?curid=1239399" title="Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos">
<text>Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos (born Rafael Frühbeck; 15 September 1933 – 11 June 2014) was a Spanish conductor and composer. Frühbeck was born in Burgos, Spain to a family of German ancestry. He first took up conducting while on military service in the Spanish Army before graduating from the Hochschule für Musik in Munich. Frühbeck was principal conductor of various orchestras around the world, starting with the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra from 1958 to 1962, then moving on to the Spanish National Orchestra, Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo and many others. Throughout his career Frühbeck de Burgos recorded on a number of labels. He was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts and History &quot;Institución Fernán González&quot;. His honours include the 2011 Conductor of the Year award from &quot;Musical America&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Burgos, Spain, Frühbeck came from a family of German ancestry. His father had been wounded in World War I, and during his employment after the war for the Spanish section of a German company, decided to settle in Spain in order to reduce the need to travel. He then sent for his fiancée in Germany, and the couple reunited in Spain. Frühbeck&#x27;s mother introduced him to the violin, and he had become concertmaster of the local orchestra by age 14. As a youth, he continued violin studies, along with piano, and composition, at the conservatories of Bilbao and Madrid. He first took up conducting while on military service in the Spanish Army. He graduated summa cum laude from the Hochschule für Musik in Munich in conducting and won the Richard Strauss Prize.

==Career==
Frühbeck was principal conductor of the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra from 1958 to 1962. During this time, the orchestra&#x27;s manager persuaded Frühbeck to use a name that would more clearly indicate his Spanish identity. He subsequently took the professional surname &quot;Frühbeck de Burgos&quot; as his artist&#x27;s name, to include the name of his birth city. He served as principal conductor of the Spanish National Orchestra from 1962 to 1978.

Outside Spain, Frühbeck de Burgos served as &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; of the Düsseldorf Symphony Orchestra (1966–1971), music director of the Rundfunkorchester Berlin, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, artistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and chief conductor of the Vienna Symphony. He also was principal guest conductor for various orchestras in Europe, Japan, and the United States, including the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, DC, from 1980 to 1988. He made his American debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra in February 1969. From 1980 to 1983, he was principal conductor of the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo.

From 2001 to 2007, Frühbeck de Burgos was principal conductor of the RAI National Symphony Orchestra. He was music director of the Dresden Philharmonic from 2004 to 2011. In January 2011, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Frühbeck de Burgos as the Creative Director of its Masterworks Series of concerts, starting with the 2011–12 season. He held the post for two seasons, from 2011 to 2013.

==Later life==
In February 2011, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Frühbeck de Burgos as its principal conductor, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of three years through 2015. However, on 4 June 2014, he resigned as chief conductor of the orchestra, with immediate effect. In parallel, Frühbeck de Burgos announced his retirement from conducting and that he had cancer. His final concert as a conductor had been in Washington, DC on 14 March 2014, with the National Symphony Orchestra.

Frühbeck de Burgos died on 11 June 2014 in Pamplona, Spain. He was buried in his home town of Burgos. He was survived by his wife, María del Carmen Martínez de Frühbeck, whom he married in 1959, and his two children, Rafael Frühbeck Martínez and Gema Frühbeck Martínez.

==Recognition==
Frühbeck de Burgos recorded on a number of labels, where his recordings include Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;, &quot;Paulus&quot; the Mozart &quot;Requiem&quot;, Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, and Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen.&quot; He was known as well for his recording of the complete works of Manuel de Falla and a series of complete zarzuela recordings. Frühbeck orchestrated a suite from Isaac Albéniz&#x27;s &quot;Suite española&quot; and conducted the New Philharmonia Orchestra in a commercial recording of this arrangement. His work in contemporary music included conducting the world premiere production of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s opera &quot;Goya&quot;. He was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts and History &quot;Institución Fernán González&quot;. His honours include the 2011 Conductor of the Year award from &quot;Musical America&quot;.

<text>The Land Before Time is a 1988 animated adventure film directed and co-produced by Don Bluth from a screenplay by Stu Krieger and a story by Judy Freudberg and Tony Geiss. It is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy, and Frank Marshall. The film stars the voices of Judith Barsi, Burke Byrnes, Gabriel Damon, Bill Erwin, Pat Hingle, Candace Hutson, Will Ryan and Helen Shaver. It is the first film in the &quot;Land Before Time&quot; franchise.

Produced by Amblin Entertainment and Sullivan Bluth Studios, it features dinosaurs living in prehistoric times. The plot features a young brown &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; named Littlefoot, who ends up alone after his mother is attacked by a villainous &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and dies. Littlefoot flees famine and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation, where the adult dinosaurs have moved on to. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera, an orange &quot;Triceratops&quot;, Ducky, a green &quot;Saurolophus&quot;, Petrie, a brown &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, and Spike, a green &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. The film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot&#x27;s mother and forced to deal with a &quot;sharptooth&quot; (&quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;).

&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which Dom DeLuise did not participate (instead, he starred in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; released that same day), and the only film in the &quot;Land Before Time&quot; series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide. It was also the last film that Bluth directed that was scored by James Horner, executive produced by Spielberg, and distributed by Universal Pictures.

The film was released by Universal on November 18, 1988 to generally positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing $84.4 million. Its success, along with &quot;An American Tail&quot; and the 1988 live-action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; led Spielberg to found his animation studio, Amblimation. The first film spawned a franchise with thirteen direct-to-video sequels, a television series, video games and merchandise, none of which had Bluth, Spielberg nor Lucas&#x27; involvement (though Amblin Entertainment was involved in the television series like it was for &quot;Fievel&#x27;s American Tails&quot;). It is currently Don Bluth&#x27;s second highest-grossing animated film, only behind &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997).

== Plot ==
During the age of the dinosaurs, a famine forces groups of dinosaurs to look for an oasis known as the Great Valley. A &quot;longneck&quot; dinosaur hatches a single baby named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot encounters and plays with Cera, a young &quot;three-horn&quot; dinosaur until her father intervenes and says &quot;three-horns never play with longnecks&quot;. In the evening Littlefoot plays with Cera again until a large &quot;sharptooth&quot; dinosaur pursues them. Littlefoot&#x27;s mother eventually comes to their rescue, but is fatally wounded. During the struggle, an earthshake strikes and splits the land, swallowing up the sharptooth and dividing Littlefoot, Cera, and other dinosaurs from their herds; several die in the process. Before dying, Littlefoot&#x27;s wounded mother gives him some words of advice about finding the Great Valley: &quot;&quot;let your heart guide you. It whispers, so listen closely&quot;.&quot; Confused, and in-grief, Littlefoot meets Rooter, an older dinosaur who consoles him. Littlefoot is then guided by his mother&#x27;s voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley. First, he must pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the &quot;Mountains that Burn&quot;.

Later Littlefoot meets a young &quot;bigmouth&quot; dinosaur named Ducky and a young &quot;&quot;flyer&quot; dinosaur named Petrie, themselves separated from their families during the earthshake, who accompany him on his journey. Looking for her own kind, Cera finds the unconscious sharptooth inside a ravine and inadvertently wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie. While describing her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky in the direction of a lone hatching &quot;spiketail&quot;&quot; egg, from which a male emerges; Ducky names the hatchling &quot;Spike&quot; and inducts him into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is depleted by a herd of longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, she and everyone else gravitate to Littlefoot&#x27;s side for warmth and companionship.

The next morning, they are attacked by the sharptooth but manage to escape through a tunnel which is too small for him to follow. They discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot&#x27;s mother. At the Mountains that Burn, a clash between Littlefoot&#x27;s intention to follow his mother&#x27;s directions and Cera&#x27;s insistence on leaving the group results in a fight between them which causes the others to follow Cera, forcing Littlefoot to continue alone. When Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, and Petrie gets stuck in a tar pit, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Cera gets ambushed by a group of &quot;domeheads&quot; who live in the Mountains that Burn; the rest of the group pose as a tar monster, scaring away the domeheads and frightening Cera. After realizing who it really is, Cera angrily leaves the group and breaks down in tears, ashamed of her selfishness. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the sharptooth nearby. The group devises a plan to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the sharptooth&#x27;s nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.

The plan nearly fails when the sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera, having overcome her sorrow, reunites with the group and headbutts the boulder, causing the sharptooth to fall into the water, the boulder crashing into him in the process. The sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him, but Petrie emerges unharmed while the sharptooth has drowned. Littlefoot, alone and about to give up on his search, sees his mother as a cloud; she guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. After arrival the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot finds his grandparents. The group reunites at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
During production of &quot;An American Tail&quot;, talk began of the next feature with Bluth and executive producer Steven Spielberg. Bluth and Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to &quot;Bambi&quot;, but with dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg&#x27;s longtime friend George Lucas was also brought in on the project after being interested with it. The three persuaded &quot;An American Tail&quot; writers Judy Freudberg and Tony Geiss (both of whom were also prominent writers for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) to write the screenplay for the film. Their initial draft was based on their early ideas, but when it was felt the story was too juvenile, Stu Krieger was brought on to revise their draft. Early into story development, the film was about a group of young dinosaurs looking for a wise, older dinosaur. Later on, Bluth explained, &quot;...we came up with another idea that none of these dinosaurs get along with each other, they all hate each other. They&#x27;re taught from the time they were born not to associate with each other, that&#x27;s racism&quot;. An early working title for the film was &quot;The Land Before Time Began&quot;. Bluth, Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; sequence in &quot;Fantasia&quot;, but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.

=== Animation ===
As work on the script continued, Bluth delegated some of the animation staff to begin creating concept art. As with his previous films, Bluth handled the storyboarding, but with final revisions by Larry Leker. Production was initially delayed by several months as the studio moved to Ireland. Production would eventually begin in spring 1987, a few months after the release of &quot;An American Tail&quot;.

The production was preceded by extensive research, including visits to natural history museums in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. Skeletons, fossils, and paleoart from the turn of the century were consulted to help create a credible landscape and animals. Further research was conducted using live-action footage of quadrupedal modern animals, including elephants and giraffes.

=== Editing ===

Late into production, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the film would appear too dark and intense for young children. At a screening in Soho Square, London in late April 1988, six months before the film was completed, Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film: &quot;It&#x27;s too scary. We&#x27;ll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don&#x27;t want that&quot;. A total of 19 fully animated shots from the sharptooth attack were cut from the final film. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of sharptooth&#x27;s snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence. This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.

Perhaps just weeks before the film&#x27;s release, more than 10 additional minutes of footage was cut from the film by Spielberg &quot;to be sure it would not disturb parents or their children&quot;, according to producer Gary Goldman, reducing the runtime from 80 to 82 minutes to just 69 minutes. Much of the cut footage also consisted of sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. An extended scene involving the introduction of Spike was deleted, as was some of the &quot;Green Food&quot; sequence. Petrie&#x27;s apparent death scene originally went longer, and was followed by a group hug where Littlefoot says &quot;Now we&#x27;ll always be together&quot; (this line survives in the form of a Pizza Hut promotional advertisement for the film). The film&#x27;s final act was also heavily altered and rearranged; originally, Littlefoot was to find the Great Valley on his own before turning back to rescue his friends, kill sharptooth, and enter the valley as a group. This ending survives in multiple book adaptations, and the music accompanying it still exists in the official soundtrack release. Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations. The scenes are believed to be destroyed, but some did make it into multiple advertisements and trailers created before the release of the film, and multiple stills can be found in storybook adaptations and press kits for the movie. Much of the unused music from the film score was meant to play over the deleted scenes. Many animation cels and drawings from the deleted scenes have surfaced on the internet.

== Music ==
The music for &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was composed by James Horner, who had previously provided the soundtrack for &quot;An American Tail&quot;, and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and the Choir of King&#x27;s College. An official soundtrack was released on audio cassette and vinyl record on November 21, 1988 and later on CD by MCA Records; it features seven tracks from the film: The Great Migration, Sharptooth and the Earthquake, Whispering Winds, If we Hold on Together, Foraging for Food, The Rescue/ Discovery of the Great Valley, and End Credits. The film&#x27;s theme song &quot;If We Hold on Together&quot;, written by Horner and Will Jennings, was sung by Diana Ross. It was released as the soundtrack&#x27;s lead and only single on November 5 the same year, peaking at number 23 on the US adult contemporary charts; the song was later included on her 1991 album &quot;The Force Behind the Power&quot;. A digital version of the soundtrack was released on a number of services on January 22, 2013 by Geffen Records.

An expanded version of the soundtrack album was released by Intrada Records on October 27, 2020. The release featured newly remastered versions of the music on the original album, as well as 15 minutes of previously unreleased material.

== Release ==
&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; opened on November 18, 1988. Attached to the film, Universal and Amblin issued Brad Bird&#x27;s &quot;Family Dog&quot; short from their television anthology &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
During its opening weekend, the film opened at number one in the United States and Canada, grossing $7.5 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $48.1 million at the US box office, slightly more than Don Bluth&#x27;s previous film, &quot;An American Tail&quot;, but $5 million less than &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; which was released at the same time. Overall, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; grossed $84.5 million worldwide.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; holds approval rating from review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes from critics, with the consensus: &quot;Beautifully animated and genuinely endearing, &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; is sure to please dino-obsessed tykes, even if it&#x27;s a little too cutesy for older viewers&quot;. Metacritic assigned a score of 66, based on reviews by 15 critics, signifying &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot; on a November 19, 1988, episode of their television program &quot;At the Movies&quot;. Siskel found it to be &quot;sweet more than it was scary&quot; and &quot;quite beautiful&quot;, also praising its straightforward story and remarked that he would recommend it to children over Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oliver and Company&quot;, released on the same day. In his own review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film three out of four stars; he wrote, &quot;I guess I sort of liked the film, although I wonder why it couldn&#x27;t have spent more time on natural history and the sense of discovery, and less time on tragedy&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;People&quot; magazine felt the film had an unclear audience: &quot;The animation is fine. But the Stu Krieger screenplay contains violence that might be hard on the younger ones, [...] and a never-let-up cuteness that can turn minds of all ages to mush&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Sheila Benson also stated that the film&#x27;s enjoyment was limited to younger viewers, remarking &quot;do dinosaurs really lend themselves to ootsie-cutesiness?&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;though it&#x27;s not a great film, it is an entertaining and, at times, emotionally rich one&quot;.

Many reviewers compared &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; to films from Disney&#x27;s Golden Age. Steven Rea of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that the film &quot;looks and sounds as if it came out of the Disney Studios of the &#x27;40s or &#x27;50s. Which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing&quot;, calling it &quot;meticulously crafted&quot; but was also &quot;mildly disappoint[ed]&quot; that the dialog wasn&#x27;t sophisticated as the older films were. In her review for the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, Candice Russel remarked, &quot;&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; works by evoking the simple virtues of this art aimed at children, as it was in the beginning when Disney animated Mickey Mouse&quot;. A review from the &quot;Motion Picture Guide 1989 Annual&quot; noted that the film &quot;has been called a sort of prehistoric &quot;Bambi&quot;&quot;. David Kehr from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that the film&#x27;s title &quot;also refers to the Disney past, but it goes for all the marbles. Its model is nothing less than the life-cycle saga of &quot;Bambi&quot;, and that Bluth gets even half the way there is proof of a major talent&quot;. Kehr gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it &quot;as handsome and honest an animated feature as any produced since Walt Disney&#x27;s death; it may even be the best&quot;.

Don Bluth&#x27;s membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints influenced the themes of the film. In an interview with &quot;Church News&quot; he said, &quot;Everything I do is centered around the gospel. Even our films are, although the secular world would never realize it&quot;. Randy Astle said that Littlefoot can be read as a Christ figure because of his special birth circumstances and position as a leader of his people. The journey to the Great Valley, which is to the west, mirrors that of the Mormon pioneers, who moved from fertile lands in the east to the arid and mountainous great basin. Astle concluded that &quot;Littlefoot is both a Joseph Smith—he sees a pillar of light and receives heavenly visitors—and a Brigham Young –he leads his followers across the plains&quot;.

== Accolades ==
&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Family Animation or Fantasy Motion Picture&quot; at the 10th annual Youth in Film Awards, losing out to Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. It received a nomination for &quot;Best Fantasy Film&quot; at the 16th Saturn Awards ceremony in 1990, beaten by &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

== Home media ==
&quot;The Land Before Time&quot; was released on VHS by MCA Home Video on September 14, 1989, and on November 22, 1991, as well as LaserDisc in regular pan and scan and &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; CAV-play editions by MCA/Universal Home Video in North America, and CIC Video internationally. According to the book &quot;The Animated Films of Don Bluth&quot;, the original release had &quot;very successful business&quot; on the home video market, and included a promotional tie-in with Pizza Hut in North America, which was offering rubber hand puppets based on the film at the time. Pizza Hut also had its partnership with the film&#x27;s VHS release in Australia. The VHS version was made available once more on February 20, 1996, under the Universal Family Features label, and was later packaged with following three films in the series as part of the &quot;Land Before Time Collection&quot; on December 4, 2001.

The film was released on DVD for the first time on April 30, 1997, and re-released on December 2, 2003, as the &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; for the movie&#x27;s 15th anniversary, which included games and sing-along songs. The Anniversary Edition was later included with &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;Balto&quot; as a three-movie pack in November 2007. A widescreen Blu-ray version was available for the first time on October 13, 2015, which included digital HD and UltraViolet copies, which was accompanied by a new widescreen DVD release on the same day. The Blu-ray was re-released on January 15, 2019.

== Legacy ==

The film generated 13 direct-to-video sequels, which differ from the original by adding &quot;sing-along&quot; musical numbers. Bluth, Spielberg, and Lucas have no affiliation with any of the film&#x27;s sequels. The sequels have generally been met with mixed reception: many fans of the original disregarded the sequels, while others have embraced the sequels into the canon of the story.

In 2007, a television series was released in North America. It follows the style of the sequels in terms of the morality and the musical numbers (with some of the songs being shortened and reworked).

<text>Stamatios &quot;Stamatis&quot; Kleanthis (; 1802–1862) was a Greek architect.

== Biography ==
Stamatios Kleanthis was born to a Macedonian Greek family in the town of Velventos in Kozani, Macedonia in 1802. As a youth he moved to Bucharest where he studied at the Greek School. On 1821, as member of the Sacred Band, he fought in the insurrection against the Turks led by Alexander Ypsilanti and was captured at the Battle of Dragashani. After escaping, he traveled to Vienna, and then to Leipzig, where he studied architecture. Afterwards he pursued his studies further in Berlin with Karl Friedrich Schinkel.

After graduation, he returned with his colleague and friend Eduard Schaubert to Greece, where they were appointed public engineers by Ioannis Kapodistrias. On 1832 they created a new city plan for Athens, which included wide avenues, gardens and grand public buildings and gave the first street names in Athens. The plan was however simplified by Leo von Klenze, as it was considered too expensive. After disagreements with the administration, Kleanthis resigned his position.

Kleanthis gained great wealth not only through architecture, but also through the marble quarries he operated on the island of Paros. Marble from his quarries received a gold medal at the London Great Exhibition in 1851.

On 1862 he was seriously injured in an accident in a quarry and he was transported to Athens, where he died.

Kleanthis designed many important buildings in Athens, including the Duchess of Plaisance&#x27;s mansion in Penteli, Rododafni Castle and Villa Ilissia (today the Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum of Athens). The University of Athens was initially accommodated in his house in Plaka, which now houses the Athens University Museum.

<text>Hélène Rose Paule Grimaud (born 7 November 1969) is a French classical pianist and the founder of the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, New York.

==Early life and education==
Grimaud was born in Aix-en-Provence, France, the daughter of teachers Claude and Josette Grimaud (née Cirelli). She described family nationalities in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview with John Rockwell: &quot;My father came from a background of Sephardi Jews in Africa, and my mother&#x27;s ancestors were Jewish Berbers from Corsica.&quot; Her father was adopted as a child by a French family and he became a university tutor teaching languages. According to Luc Antonini the name Grimaud is typical of the region of Trets in Provence. She discovered the piano at seven. In 1982, she entered the Conservatoire de Paris, where she studied with Jacques Rouvier. In 1985, she won 1st Prize at the Conservatory and the Grand Prix du Disque of the Académie Charles Cros for her recording of the Rachmaninoff &quot;Piano Sonata No. 2.&quot;

She experiences synesthesia, where one physical sense adds to another, in her case seeing music as colour, which helps her with memorising music scores.

==Career==
Grimaud has established herself not only as a virtuoso pianist, but also as a committed wildlife conservationist, a human rights activist and as a writer.

She began her piano studies at the local conservatory with Jacqueline Courtin before going on to work with Pierre Barbizet in Marseille. She was accepted into the Paris Conservatoire at just 13 and won first prize in piano performance three years later. She continued to study with György Sándor and Leon Fleisher until, in 1987, she gave her well-received debut recital in Tokyo. That same year, renowned conductor Daniel Barenboim invited her to perform with the Orchestre de Paris.

She debuted in 1995 with the Berliner Philharmoniker under Claudio Abbado and with the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur in 1999. It was around this time that Grimaud established the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, New York.

Her love for the endangered species was sparked by a chance encounter with a wolf in northern Florida; this led to her determination to open an environmental education centre. &quot;When you look at a wolf in the eye, you establish a connection,&quot; Ms. Grimaud said. &quot;Hearing about wolves and seeing a wolf are two very different things. It’s about accomplishing the goals of outreach — building a bridge of understanding to our counterparts in the wild — and environmental conservation. If you call me an activist, I’m happy.&quot; In addition, she is also a member of the organisation Musicians for Human Rights, a worldwide network of musicians and people working in the field of music to promote a culture of human rights and social change.

Grimaud has also published four books that have appeared in various languages. Her first, Variations Sauvages, appeared in 2003. It was followed in 2005 by Leçons particulières, and in 2013 by Retour à Salem, both semi-autobiographical novels. In 2023 she published Renaître.

She tours extensively as a soloist and recitalist. A committed chamber musician, she has also performed at the most prestigious festivals and cultural events with a wide range of musical collaborators, including Sol Gabetta, Rolando Villazón, Jan Vogler, Truls Mørk, Clemens Hagen, Gidon Kremer, Gil Shaham and the Capuçon brothers. Her contribution to and impact on the world of classical music were recognised by the French government when she was admitted into the Ordre National de la Légion d’Honneur (France&#x27;s highest decoration) at the rank of Chevalier (Knight).

Grimaud has been an exclusive Deutsche Grammophon artist since 2002. Her recordings have been critically acclaimed and awarded numerous accolades, among them the Cannes Classical Recording of the Year, Choc du Monde de la musique, Diapason d’or, Grand Prix du disque, Record Academy Prize (Tokyo), Midem Classic Award and the Echo Klassik Award.

Her early recordings include &quot;Credo&quot; and &quot;Reflection&quot; (both of which feature a number of thematically linked works); a Chopin and Rachmaninov Sonatas disc; a Bartók CD on which she plays the Third Piano Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra and Pierre Boulez; a Beethoven disc with the Staatskapelle Dresden and Vladimir Jurowski which was chosen as one of history&#x27;s greatest classical music albums in the iTunes &quot;Classical Essentials&quot; series; a selection of Bach’s solo and concerto works, in which she directed the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen from the piano; and a DVD release of Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto with the Lucerne Festival Orchestra and Claudio Abbado.

In 2010 Grimaud recorded the solo recital album &quot;Resonances&quot;, showcasing music by Mozart, Berg, Liszt and Bartók. This was followed in 2011 by a disc featuring her readings of Mozart’s Piano Concertos Nos. 19 and 23 as well as a collaboration with singer Mojca Erdmann in the same composer’s Ch’io mi scordi di te?. Her next release, &quot;Duo&quot;, recorded with cellist Sol Gabetta, won the 2013 Echo Klassik Award for &quot;chamber recording of the year&quot;, and her album of the two Brahms piano concertos, the First recorded with Andris Nelsons and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Second with Nelsons and the Vienna Philharmonic, appeared in September 2013.

This was followed by &quot;Water&quot; (January 2016), a live recording of performances from &quot;tears become… streams become…&quot;, the critically-acclaimed large-scale immersive installation at New York&#x27;s Park Avenue Armory created by Turner Prize-winning artist Douglas Gordon in collaboration with Grimaud. &quot;Water&quot; features works by nine composers: Berio, Takemitsu, Fauré, Ravel, Albéniz, Liszt, Janáček, Debussy and Nitin Sawhney, who wrote seven short &quot;Water Transitions&quot; for the album as well as producing it. April 2017 then saw the release of &quot;Perspectives&quot;, a two-disc personal selection of highlights from her DG catalogue, including two &quot;encores&quot; – Brahms&#x27;s Waltz in A flat and Sgambati&#x27;s arrangement of Gluck’s &quot;Dance of the Blessed Spirits&quot; – previously unreleased on CD/via streaming.

Grimaud&#x27;s next album, &quot;Memory&quot;, was released in September 2018. Exploring music&#x27;s ability to bring the past back to life, it comprises a selection of evanescent miniatures by Chopin, Debussy, Satie and Valentin Silvestrov which, in the pianist&#x27;s own words, &quot;conjure atmospheres of fragile reflection, a mirage of what was – or what could have been&quot;.

For her 2020 recording, &quot;The Messenger&quot;, Grimaud has created an intriguing dialogue between Silvestrov and Mozart. &quot;I was always interested in couplings that were not predictable,&quot; she explains, &quot;because I feel as if certain pieces can shed a special light on to one another.&quot; She is joined by the Camerata Salzburg in Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto K466 and Silvestrov&#x27;s Two Dialogues with Postscript and The Messenger – 1996, of which she also performs a solo version. Completing the programme are Mozart&#x27;s Fantasias K397 and K475. The Messenger was released on 2 October 2020.

In 2023 Hélène released &quot;Silent Songs&quot; paying homage to Ukraine’s greatest living composer with an album of songs by Valentin Silvestrov. Joined by the young baritone Konstantin Krimmel, winner of the 2018 International Helmut Deutsch Lied Competition, Grimaud presents the gentle music and quiet nostalgia of some of the most exquisitely beautiful poetry ever written.

Following &quot;Silent Songs&quot; is &quot;For Clara&quot; - another album on Deutsche Grammophon on which she pairs Robert Schumann’s Kreisleriana with music by his protégé, Johannes Brahms. This includes a set of songs in which Brahms distilled his unrequited love for Schumann’s widow Clara, and for which Grimaud is partnered by baritone Konstantin Krimmel.

Forthcoming highlights of Grimaud’s &#x27;23/&#x27;24 schedule include performances of Brahms’s Piano Concerto No. 1 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra across Europe (October/November) and with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg (October) as part of her season-long residency at the Philharmonie Luxembourg; Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 20 with The Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick Nézet-Séguin (December); recitals in Boston, Atlanta, Chicago and Toronto (January/February); and performances with Camerata Salzburg (with whom she embarks on a new artistic partnership in the 2023-24 season) of the Schumann Piano Concerto at the Vienna Konzerthaus, Dresden Music Festival, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival (together with Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto) and Évian Festival (May/June). Following on from the success of Silent Songs, she and Konstantin Krimmel will perform songs from Silvestrov’s cycle in Luxembourg and Dortmund (June).

In 2024, film director David Serero released on Amazon Prime Video his film &quot;Between The Notes&quot; about Hélène Grimaud through a series of personal interviews and archives. The film, featuring Yannick Nézet-Seguin, Bryn Terfel, Alain Duault, Jacques Rouvier and more, is screened in movie theaters. The film is produced in partnership with Deutsche Grammophon and is awarded at several film festivals worldwide.

=== Critical reception ===
Critics have praised Grimaud&#x27;s willingness to reinterpret works and take chances, and compared her to Glenn Gould: 

Grimaud doesn&#x27;t sound like most pianists: she is a rubato artist, a reinventor of phrasings, a taker of chances. &quot;A wrong note that is played out of élan, you hear it differently than one that is played out of fear,&quot; she says. She admires the &quot;more extreme players . . . people who wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to play their conception to the end.&quot; Her two overriding characteristics are independence and drive, and her performances attempt, whenever possible, to shake up conventional pianistic wisdom. Brian Levine, the executive director of the Glenn Gould Foundation, sees in Grimaud a resemblance to Gould: &quot;She has this willingness to take a piece of music apart and free herself from the general body of practice that has grown up around it.&quot;
==Personal life==
In 1991, at age 21, Grimaud moved to Tallahassee, Florida. In 1997, she settled in Westchester County, north of New York City. After some time spent in Berlin, she took up residence in Weggis, near Luzern, Switzerland.

She has a passion for wolves and wolf conservation. She now divides her time between her musical career and the Wolf Conservation Center in South Salem, New York.

Grimaud lives with her partner, the German photographer Mat Hennek, in California and Upstate New York.

<doc id="1239429" wikidata="Q988625" url="?curid=1239429" title="Southampton Itchen (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Southampton, Itchen is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Darren Paffey from the Labour Party (UK). Before then, it had been held since 2015 by Royston Smith GM of the Conservative Party, who had announced his retirement from frontline politics in 2023 and did not seek re-election in 2024.

The constituency is named after the River Itchen, which flows through it and is the lesser of the two major rivers that reach the tidal estuary of Southampton Water at the city.

==History==
The constituency was created in 1950, when the two-member Southampton constituency was abolished.

Until 1979 it was a safe Labour seat – apart from 1965 to 1971, when Horace King became the first member of the Labour Party to serve as the Speaker of the House of Commons. A Conservative MP, Christopher Chope, was elected in 1983 and 1987 after the sitting MP Bob Mitchell left Labour in 1981 for the SDP. The combination of Mitchell as a strong SDP-Liberal Alliance candidate in both 1983 and 1987, together with Conservative landslides, made Southampton Itchen highly competitive.

Since 1987, campaigns in the seat have resulted in a minimum of 26.8% of votes at each election consistently for the same two parties&#x27; choice for candidate, and the next highest-placed share having fluctuated between 3% and 23% of the vote. In those recent elections, save for 2015 when UKIP surged nationally, the third-placed candidate has been a Liberal Democrat, whose candidate lost their deposit in the result perhaps uniquely for an English university city seat in 2017, but which takes in far fewer of the university areas than Southampton Test. The seat attracted nine candidates in 1997; three in 1992. Oldest elections in the seat were sometimes a two-candidate contest, as in comparator mid-twentieth century English elections.

Labour candidate John Denham, defeated Chope by 551 votes in 1992 and held the seat with low-to-average majorities until 2010 when he won by 192 votes. From 2010 to 2017, the three general election results in the seat presented themselves as two-party ultra-marginal (finely-balanced) contests.

Royston Smith GM gained the seat as a Conservative Party candidate in 2015. He had led his party&#x27;s group on the city council and first contested the seat in 2010. He retained the seat in the 2017 general election with a majority of 31 votes, and subsequently at the 2019 general election with a majority of over 4,000 votes. Following Smith&#x27;s retirement for the 2024 election, the seat was retaken for Labour by Darren Paffey on a swing of 12.8%, resulting in a majority of over 6,000.

==Boundaries==

=== Historic ===
1950–1955: The County Borough of Southampton wards of Bevois, Bitterne and Peartree, Bitterne and Sholing, Newtown, Northam, Portswood, St Denys, St Mary&#x27;s, Trinity, and Woolston.

1955–1983: The County Borough of Southampton wards of Bitterne, Harefield, Peartree and Bitterne Manor, St Denys and Bitterne Park, St Luke&#x27;s, St Mary&#x27;s, Sholing, Swaythling, and Woolston.

1983–1997: The City of Southampton wards of Bargate, Bitterne, Bitterne Park, Harefield, Peartree, St Luke&#x27;s, and Sholing.

1997–2023: The City of Southampton wards of Bargate, Bitterne, Bitterne Park, Harefield, Peartree, Sholing, and Woolston.

=== Current ===
Following a review of local authority ward boundaries, which became effective in May 2023, the constituency now comprises the following:

* The City of Southampton wards of Bargate, Bitterne Park, Harefield, Peartree, Sholing, Thornhill, and Woolston; and two polling districts from the Banister &amp; Polygon ward.

The 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which was based on the ward structure in place at 1 December 2020, left the boundaries unchanged.

The constituency is bounded to the west by Southampton Test (Labour), to the north by Romsey and Southampton North (Conservative), to the north east by Eastleigh (Lib Dem) and to the south east by Hamble Valley (Conservative).

==Constituency profile==
The seat covers the eastern part of the City of Southampton, in southern England, specifically the city centre, the eastern port areas (the Port of Southampton is one of the principal ports of the UK), the exclusive Ocean Village quarter, the inner city council estates and the economically deprived Thornhill estate on its eastern boundary. It is seen as the more working class of the two constituencies in the city. The other is Southampton Test – named after the River Test.

<doc id="1239430" wikidata="Q240772" url="?curid=1239430" title="Abraham Wald">
<text>Abraham Wald (; , ;  – ) was a Jewish Hungarian mathematician who contributed to decision theory, geometry and econometrics, and founded the field of sequential analysis. One of his well-known statistical works was written during World War II on how to minimize the damage to bomber aircraft and took into account the survivorship bias in his calculations. He spent his research career at Columbia University. He was the grandson of Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner.

== Life and career ==

Wald was born on 31 October 1902 in Kolozsvár, Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary. A religious Jew, he did not attend school on Saturdays, as was then required by the Hungarian school system, and so he was homeschooled by his parents until college. His parents were quite knowledgeable and competent as teachers.

In 1928, he graduated in mathematics from the King Ferdinand I University. In 1927, he had entered graduate school at the University of Vienna, from which he graduated in 1931 with a Ph.D. in mathematics. His advisor there was Karl Menger.

Despite Wald&#x27;s brilliance, he could not obtain a university position because of Austrian discrimination against Jews. However, Oskar Morgenstern created a position for Wald in economics. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the discrimination against Jews intensified. In particular, Wald and his family were persecuted as Jews. Wald emigrated to the United States at the invitation of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, to work on econometrics research.
During World War II, Wald was a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia University, where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems. They included methods of sequential analysis and sampling inspection. One of the problems that the SRG worked on was to examine the distribution of damage to aircraft returning after flying missions to provide advice on how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. Wald derived a useful means of estimating the damage distribution for all aircraft that flew from the data on the damage distribution of all aircraft that returned. His work is considered seminal in the discipline of operational research, which was then fledgling.

Wald and his wife died in 1950 when the Air India plane (VT-CFK, a DC-3 aircraft) in which they were travelling crashed near the Rangaswamy Pillar in the northern part of the Nilgiri Mountains, in southern India, on an extensive lecture tour at the invitation of the Indian government. He had visited the Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta and was to attend the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore in January. Their two children were back at home in the United States.

After his death, Wald was criticized by Sir Ronald A. Fisher FRS. Fisher attacked Wald for being a mathematician without scientific experience who had written an incompetent book on statistics. Fisher particularly criticized Wald&#x27;s work on the design of experiments and alleged ignorance of the basic ideas of the subject, as set out by Fisher and Frank Yates. Wald&#x27;s work was defended by Jerzy Neyman the next year. Neyman explained Wald&#x27;s work, particularly with respect to the design of experiments. Lucien Le Cam credits him in his own book, &quot;Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory&quot;: &quot;The ideas and techniques used reflect first and foremost the influence of Abraham Wald&#x27;s writings.&quot;

He is the father of the noted American physicist Robert Wald.

<text>Elisabeth Grümmer (née Schilz; 31 March 1911 – 6 November 1986) was a German soprano. She has been described as &quot;a singer blessed with elegant musicality, warm-hearted sincerity, and a voice of exceptional beauty&quot;.

==Life==
Elisabeth Schilz was born in &quot;Niederjeutz&quot; [now Yutz, near &quot;Diedenhofen&quot; (Thionville), Alsace-Lorraine] to German parents. In 1918, her family was expelled from Lorraine, and they settled in Meiningen, where she studied theater and made her stage debut as Klärchen in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Egmont&quot;.

She married the concertmaster of the theater orchestra, Detlev Grümmer, and became a mother. The family moved to Aachen, where they met Herbert von Karajan under whose encouragement she made her operatic debut in 1940, in the role of First Flowermaiden in a 1940 performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;. She went on from Aachen to perform in Duisburg and Prague.

Her husband was killed in their house during the bombing of Aachen in 1944. After the war, she settled in Berlin, singing at the Städtische Oper Berlin. She performed in the major opera houses in Europe and the United States, restricting herself to a small number of roles, primarily sung in German. She was also active in song recitals and concert performances, particularly of Brahms&#x27; &quot;German Requiem&quot;.

The &quot;Kammersängerin&quot; became a professor at the Berlin Musikhochschule. Among her students were Astrid Schirmer, Gillian Rae-Walker, and Janis Kelly.

Grümmer died in Warendorf, Westphalia on 6 November 1986.

==Work and critical reception==
Grümmer was acclaimed both as an opera singer and as a lieder interpreter. The book, &quot;The Grove Book of Opera Singers&quot;, referred to her &quot;beautiful voice, clarity of diction and innate musicianship&quot; evidenced by her legacy on record.

She appeared in two videotaped performances as Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, one conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler and the other in German translation conducted by Ferenc Fricsay.

<text>The Savoia-Marchetti S.55 was a double-hulled monoplane flying boat designed and produced by the Italian aircraft manufacturer Savoia-Marchetti. It was designed to perform both commercial and military applications.

The S.55 featured numerous innovative design features. While the passengers and cargo were housed within the twin hulls, the flight crew controlled the aircraft from a cockpit located in the thicker section of the wing between the two hulls. The S.55 had two inline contra-rotating propellers, mounted in tandem. The engines were canted sharply at an upward angle. Two wire-braced booms connected the triple-finned tail structure to the twin hulls and wing.

During August 1924, the S.55 performed its maiden flight. Shortly after its introduction, the S.55 set multiple records for speed, payload, altitude and range. Numerous flying boats saw service with the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and export operators such as the Spanish Air Force and the Royal Romanian Naval Aviation as reconnaissance bombers and maritime patrol aircraft. While some examples were active by the outbreak of the Second World War, the type only played a marginal role in the conflict due to their age.

==Design and development==
The Savoia-Marchetti S.55 was a double-hulled thick-section cantilever monoplane flying boat that was designed to perform both civilian and military operations, dependent upon equipment fitout. In general terms, its design was largely original and possessed numerous features that increased its practicality as a platform for naval military tasks such as minelaying and torpedo attacks. Various aspects of the flying boat eased aspects of its operation; it was relatively easy to dismantle for ground transport; the wings comprised three detachable sections while each of the hulls could be entirely detached from the centre section along with the tail unit. The engines could be readily inspected at all times, even during flight.

The twin hulls of the flying boat were spaced roughly 13 feet apart, ran for just over half of the total length of the flying boat, and had a single-step V-shaped bottom. They were constructed in a manner that permitted the internal space to be configured into a series of cabins, accommodating a maximum of 12 passengers, if so required. The flying boat&#x27;s cockpit was positioned in the centre section of the leading edge, between the two hulls; a passageway permitted personnel movements between the cockpit and the cabin space. On militarised flying boats, the stern of each hull would accommodate a tail gunner from which a relatively favourable range of fire could be obtained. Underneath the middle of the flying boat&#x27;s centre section was an intentionally clear space of roughly eight foot; this space was suitable for the mounting of either torpedoes or mine-laying apparatus.

The outer wing sections had a pronounced dihedral and sharply tapered from root to tip. The leading edge swept back about 15 degrees while the trailing edge was only slightly inclined. The wing was furnished with balanced ailerons that had an inclined axis. The tail surfaces were carried by two pairs of V-shaped outriggers; the top beam of each outrigger was attached to the upper surface of the centre section, near the rear main spar, while the lower beam was attached to the sternpost of the hull. They were cross-braced and each had a vertical strut at its forward and rear ends. Mounted on top of the rectangular horizontal stabilizing surface were three triangular vertical fins, the trailing edges of which were outfitted with hinged balanced rudders.

It was powered by a pair of Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 V-12 piston engines, each capable of providing up to 400 hp. These engines were arranged in tandem within a streamlined nacelle that was mounted high above the centre section of the aircraft, supported by a series of struts. The forward engine drove a tractor propeller while the rear engine had a pusher propeller. Cooling of both engines was achieved via a single radiator that was mounted in the nose of the nacelle. The engine nacelle was inclined, placing the line of thrust from the engines at roughly eight degrees off from the horizontal, this exerting a constant but slight upwards push throughout flight. A key reason for this arrangement was to direct the generated slipstream on to the tail surfaces. Level flight could be maintained with only the one operational engine.

==Operational history==

During August 1924, the S.55P prototype conducted its maiden flight. Throughout 1926, this same prototype set 14 separate world records for speed, altitude and distance with a payload. The type&#x27;s greatest successes, however, were its many flights between Europe and the Americas.

The First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic had been made in stages in 1922 using three different Fairey III machines, and a subsequent crossing was made by the Dornier Do J Plus Ultra in January 1926 with a single stop at the Cape Verde Islands. One year later, the first S.55 crossing was made by the &quot;Santa Maria&quot; under Francesco de Pinedo. After flying south to Bolama, at that time in Portuguese Guinea, they hoped to cross the ocean without another stop but were forced down at Cape Verde, reaching Brazil on 23 February 1927. After the crossing, the aircraft was traded to Brazil for coffee beans.

The Brazilian João Ribeiro de Barros and his crew of three made another crossing in S.55 &quot;Jahú&quot; on 24 April 1927. Departing from Santiago Island, he crossed the Atlantic in &quot;Jahú&quot; and landed at Fernando de Noronha Island, Brazil.

Pilots Francesco de Pinedo and Carlo del Prete took off from Sesto Calende, Italy, in an S-55 on 13 February 1927. Four months later, on 16 June 1927, they arrived back in Italy, having flown nearly in 193 flying hours and having made just over 50 stops, including Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and New York City.

On 20 June 1928, S.55 I-SAAT &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, piloted by Ten. Col. Umberto Maddalena of the Italian air force, located survivors of Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile&#x27;s crashed airship &quot;Italia&quot; on an ice floe about 120 km (75 mi) northeast of Nordaustlandet, Svalbard.
The Italian Air Marshal of the time, Italo Balbo, became famous for organizing a squadron of S.55s for Atlantic crossings, culminating in his 1933 flight with 24 aircraft to Chicago&#x27;s Century of Progress International Exposition. On 1 July 1933, General Balbo commanded a flight of S-55s from Orbetello, Italy, completing the flight in just over 48 hours, maintaining a tight &quot;V&quot; formation. These large fleets of aircraft were sometimes called a &quot;Balbo&quot;.

Numerous aircraft were introduced by the Regia Aeronautica and served as a long-range bomber and patrol aircraft. By the Second World War, the service&#x27;s S.55 fleet was no longer considered to be serviceable and the type was only ever held in reserve.

<text>HMS &quot;Amberley Castle&quot; was a of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. She was named after Amberley Castle near Arundel in West Sussex.

==Construction==
Laid down at S.P. Austin &amp; Son Ltd. shipyard in Sunderland on 31 May 1943 she was launched on 27 November 1943 and commissioned on 24 November 1944.

==World War II==
She served as a convoy escort until the end of the war (escorting 15 convoys in 1945) when she was put into reserve at Portsmouth until 1952.

==Weather ship==
She was in reserve at Penarth from 1953 until 1957 when she was converted to a weather ship at Blyth in Northumberland and renamed to &quot;Weather Advisor&quot; in a ceremony on 22 September 1960 at the James Watt Dock, Greenock by Lady Sutton, wife of Sir Graham Sutton, the then director-general of the Met Office. She replaced the ship known as &quot;Weather Observer&quot;, which had carried out the role since 1947.

She served in this role from 28 September 1960 onwards until she was again extensively updated in July 1976 at Manchester dry docks, and renamed &quot;Admiral Fitzroy&quot; after the British vice-admiral Robert FitzRoy, the first director of the forerunner to the British Meteorological Office.

==Fate==
The ship was finally scrapped at Troon in 1982.

<doc id="1239455" wikidata="Q432430" url="?curid=1239455" title="Irvine Laidlaw, Baron Laidlaw">
<text>Irvine Alan Stewart Laidlaw, Baron Laidlaw (born 22 December 1942) is a Scottish businessman, and a former member of the House of Lords. In the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2012&quot; ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK he was placed 105th with an estimated fortune of £745 million. In the 2020 edition, he was ranked the 180th wealthiest person in the UK, with an estimated net worth of £787 million, a decrease of £4 million from the previous year.

==Biography==
The son of Margaret and Roy Laidlaw, a Banffshire mill-owner, Laidlaw was educated at Merchiston Castle School, Leeds University and New York City&#x27;s Columbia Business School.

After graduation, Laidlaw turned a small US publishing company bought in 1973 into the Institute for International Research (IIR), the world&#x27;s largest conference organiser. After calling off a £500m flotation in 2001 when the market plunged, he sold IIR in 2005 for a sum believed to be in the order of £768m.

In 1988 Laidlaw founded Abbey Business Centres, a subsidiary of IIR providing serviced office space, meeting room facilities and virtual office packages in 13 business centres in Great Britain. The first business centre opened in Glasgow, and soon the company opened up another centre in Slough, Berkshire. Other centres were added, and in 2009 a total of 13 centres made up the organisation.

In 2015, the University of Leeds launched an official opening for the £26 million Laidlaw Library, named after Irvine Laidlaw, who had previously studied economics at the University in the 1960s. His £9 million donation is the largest the university has received from any donor. Laidlaw part owns a $2.1 billion wind-farm project, and earlier this year secured the largest clean-energy financing in 2015 from eight lenders, which included Deutsche Bank AG.

Laidlaw previously owned and raced a Jaguar, which won Le Mans a number of times throughout the 1950s, along with a number of other vintage cars, including a 1962 Ferrari GTO. in 2013, Irvine Laidlaw stopped racing. He recently sold a collection of classic sports cars to raise £17 million.

==Philanthropy==
In 2004, Laidlaw said that he would over the next 20–30 years donate most of his fortune to helping disadvantaged young people. His main vehicle used to be the Laidlaw Youth Project, which supported a range of charitable work for disadvantaged youngsters in Scotland from 2004 to 2007 when it became the Laidlaw Youth Trust (no longer operational). Currently, he is Chairman of the &quot;Irvine Laidlaw Foundation&quot;, simply known as the Laidlaw Foundation, which he set up to aid the advancement of education, especially the education of deprived young people, in particular by means of grants and other forms of financial assistance to institutions which are engaged in the provision of educational services in any part of the world. The Foundation&#x27;s activity consists of three core programmes:

* The Laidlaw Undergraduate Research and Leadership Scholarship Programme - as of 2023, the scholarship programme operates in 19 universities around the world, including Barnard College, Columbia University, EPFL, Imperial College London, London School of Economics, University of Cambridge, and University of Oxford. Every year, the programme funds cohorts of around 25 students at every institution for two summers to complete a research project with an academic supervisor, and undergo training to develop their leadership skills.

* The Laidlaw Women&#x27;s Business Education Programme - full and partial scholarships are awarded to women with financial constraints to complete MBAs in order to help them get into senior roles and ultimately achieve gender parity in industries around the world. The programme currently operates in Columbia Business School, London Business School, and in March 2020 it was also announced that Saïd Business School will join as well. In 2023, it was announced that HEC Paris would join the programme, and in 2024, IE Madrid will be joining. So far, Laidlaw donated $2 million to Columbia Business School, £3.69m to London Business School, and £1.35m to Saïd Business School as part of this scholarship programme.

* The Laidlaw Schools Trust - a multi-academy trust founded in 2008, which currently consists of 11 academies in the North East of England with 5500+ students and 850+ staff in total: Excelsior Academy, Academy 360, Atkinson Road Primary Academy, South Hylton Primary Academy, Thomas Walling Primary Academy, Westgate Hill Primary Academy, and Sedgefield Community College.

He has also donated:

* £2 million to The Prince&#x27;s Trust
* After Moray Council earmarked Rothiemay Primary School for closure, Laidlaw donated funds to a parents campaign which successfully kept 21 schools open
* Donated R9 million to fund the Amakhaya Ngoku housing project
* Laidlaw scholarship at Newcastle University, in which he funds 50% of the funding along with the university. 
* Supporting the Glyndebourne Festival production.
* Donating £100,000 to Scottish Opera
* Private investor for Ben Ainslie Racing
* Donor to the Rural Education Access Programme 
* £40,000 to Keith Grammar School, to fund a scheme to help senior pupils prepare for the world of work
* £1 million to Merchiston Castle School his former school; despite having disliked attending it, he eventually relented to persuasion by the headmaster and donated this sum. The new sixth-form house at the school, which his donation went some way to financing is named Laidlaw House.
* £9 million to the University of Leeds to support the development of the new undergraduate library, the Laidlaw Library, which opened in May 2015.
* £4 million to the University of St Andrews to support the construction of a new music building, the Laidlaw Music Centre, which opened in April 2022.

In 2007, he set up the Laidlaw Youth Trust which from 2007 to 2009 spent over £6 million in Scotland on good causes related to disadvantaged children and young people. In 2007, in emerged that the Scottish Executive had given sufficient donations to pay the salary of the CEO Laidlaw Youth project, Maureen McGinn – who is also the wife of Scotland&#x27;s most senior civil servant, Sir John Elvidge.

He closed the Trust in 2009 because he was spending more time in South Africa and said he wanted to focus his charitable giving there. It is not known how much he has gifted in his new adopted country but he was involved in some township housing project.

=== Laidlaw Opera Trust ===
In his ongoing commitment to arts and education, Lord Laidlaw founded the Laidlaw Opera Trust. The Trust aims to promote and sustain the art of opera. The Trust&#x27;s key initiatives include market research on public perceptions of opera, hosting thought leadership events such as &quot;The Business of Opera,&quot; and providing support to major opera houses and festivals.

Chair: Lord Irvine Laidlaw 
Trustees include Anne Marabini Young, Bryan Evans MBE, The Rt. Hon. Sir Charles Haddon-Cave, and Lady Amanda Haddon-Cave.

==Political donations==
One of the largest financial backers of the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party, Laidlaw was made a life peer as Baron Laidlaw, of Rothiemay in Banffshire on 14 June 2004. According to the records of the UK Electoral Commission, on 27 November 2007, Laidlaw gave a donation of £2,990,532.20 to the Conservatives. Laidlaw donated £25,000 to the 2008 London Mayoral election campaign of Boris Johnson.

==Tax status==
In 2008, Lord Laidlaw was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;Monaco-based tax exile&quot;.

Lord Laidlaw was criticised in April 2007 in the press for failing to become UK tax resident despite being appointed to the House of Lords. The BBC said that, in a letter seen by them, Laidlaw &quot;cites a variety of personal reasons&quot; for non-compliance. Criticism by Dennis Stevenson, Baron Stevenson of Coddenham, chair of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, on assurances given to the Commission by Laidlaw to become a UK tax resident by April 2004, were followed by Laidlaw taking leave of absence from the House of Lords. In 2010 following the enactment of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 he stepped down from his seat in the House of Lords to maintain his non-domiciled status and so be able to avoid paying UK residents&#x27; taxes.

==Personal life==
===General===
Laidlaw and his wife Christine divide their time between an apartment in Monaco overlooking the harbour; and their South African home, an early 20th-century 23,200 m2 estate in Noordhoek, near Cape Town. At the time of the purchase, in November 2005, it was the country&#x27;s most expensive property, bought for R106 million.

===Sex life allegations===
In April 2008, Laidlaw was the target of a sting operation staged by investigative journalist Mazher Mahmood on behalf of the British tabloid &quot;The News of the World,&quot; which revealed that Laidlaw hired up to five £3,000 vice girls at a time for all-night orgies involving spanking, bondage and lesbian sex at a Monaco hotel.

==Hobbies==
===Motor Racing===

Laidlaw regularly competes in historic car racing around the world with his Porsche 904GTS, Porsche 904/6, Maserati 250S &amp; Maserati 6CM. Laidlaw also won a medal in the Scottish amateur rally, using a Ford Focus ST. In 2007 Laidlaw added a 1001 hp Bugatti Veyron to his extensive car collection, which is sometimes seen between Noordhoek and Cape Town, on the world-famous coastal road Chapman&#x27;s Peak Drive.

===Motor Yachts===
Laidlaw has owned various luxury motor yachts with the most highprofile being Fedship built motor yacht, the &quot;Lady Christine&quot;, in 2003.

===Sailboat===
Laidlaw has been active within the yacht racing for most of his working life. He has won high-profile events including Key West Regatta and the Round the Island Race. Highly active on the maxi racing scene, he is a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Club. Laidlaw conceptualized the Cape 31 class. Some of his yachts are as follows:

<doc id="1239457" wikidata="Q4653912" url="?curid=1239457" title="ARROW waveguide">
<text>In optics, an ARROW ([[anti-resonant]] reflecting optical [[waveguide]]) is a type of waveguide that uses the principle of thin-film interference to guide light with low loss. It is formed from an anti-resonant Fabry–Pérot reflector. The optical mode is leaky, but relatively low-loss propagation can be achieved by making the Fabry–Pérot reflector of sufficiently high quality or small size.

== Principles of Operation ==
ARROW relies on the principle of thin-film interference. It is created by forming a Fabry-Perot cavity in the transverse direction, with cladding layers that function as Fabry-Perot etalons. A Fabry-Perot etalon is in resonance when the light in the layer constructively interferes with itself, resulting in high transmission. Anti-resonance occurs when the light in the layer destructively interferes with itself, resulting in no transmission through the etalon.

The refractive indexes of the guiding core (nc) and the cladding layers (nj, ni) are important and are carefully chosen. In order to make anti-resonance happen, nc needs to smaller than nj. In a typical system of a solid core ARROW, as shown in the figure, the waveguide consists of a low refractive index guiding core bounded on the upper surface by air and on the lower surface by higher refractive index antiresonant reflecting cladding layers. The confinement of light on the upper surface of the guiding core is provided by the total internal reflection with air, while the confinement on the lower surface is provided by interference created by the antiresonant cladding layers.

The thickness of the antiresonant cladding layer (tj) of an ARROW also needs to be carefully chosen in order to achieve anti-resonance. It can be calculated by the following formula:

formula_1
: formula_2 = thickness of the antiresonant cladding layer
: formula_3= thickness of the guiding core layer
: formula_4 = wavelength
: formula_5 = refractive index of antiresonant cladding layer
: formula_6 = refractive index of guiding core layer
while formula_7

== Considerations ==
ARROWs can be realized as cylindrical waveguides (2D confinement) or slab waveguides (1D confinement). The latter ARROWs are practically formed by a low index layer, embedded between higher index layers. Note that the refractive indices of these ARROWs are reversed, when comparing to usual waveguides. Light is confined by total internal reflection (TIR) on the inside of the higher index layers, but achieves a lot of modal overlap with the lower index central volume.

This strong overlap can be made plausible in a simplified picture imagining &quot;rays&quot;, as in geometrical optics. Such rays are refracted into a very shallow angle, when entering the low index inner layer. Thus, one can use the metaphor that these rays &quot;stay very long inside&quot; the low index inner layer. Note this is just a metaphor and the explanatory power of ray optics is very limited for the micrometer scales, at which these ARROWs are typically made.

== Applications ==
ARROW are often used for guiding light in liquids, particularly in photonic lab-on-a-chip analytical systems (PhLoCs). Conventional waveguides rely on the principle of total internal reflection, which can only occur if the refractive index of the guiding core material is greater than the refractive indexes of its surroundings. However, the materials used to make the guiding core are typically polymer and silicon-based materials, which have higher refractive indexes (n=1.4-3.5) than that of water (n = 1.33). As a result, a conventional hollow-core waveguide no longer works once it&#x27;s filled with water solution, making the PhLoCs useless. An ARROW, on the other hand, can be liquid-filled since it confines light completely by interference, which requires that the refractive index of the guiding core to be lower than the refractive index of the surrounding materials. Thus, ARROWs become the ideal building blocks for PhLoCs.

Though ARROWs carry big advantage over conventional waveguide for building PhLoCs, they are not perfect. The main problem of ARROW is its undesirable light loss. Light loss of ARROWs decreases the signal to noise ratio of the PhLoCs. Different versions of ARROWs have been designed and tested in order to overcome this problem.

<doc id="1239464" wikidata="Q309200" url="?curid=1239464" title="Squirrel monkey">
<text>Squirrel monkeys are New World monkeys of the genus Saimiri. &quot;Saimiri&quot; is the only genus in the subfamily Saimiriinae. The name of the genus is of Tupi origin (&quot;sai-mirím&quot; or &quot;çai-mbirín&quot;, with &quot;sai&quot; meaning &#x27;monkey&#x27; and &quot;mirím&quot; meaning &#x27;small&#x27;) and was also used as an English name by early researchers.

Squirrel monkeys live in the tropical forests of Central and South America in the canopy layer. Most species have parapatric or allopatric ranges in the Amazon, while &quot;S. oerstedii&quot; is found disjunctly in Costa Rica and Panama.

There are two main groups of squirrel monkeys recognized. They are differentiated based on the shape of the white coloration above the eyes. In total there are five recognized species. Squirrel monkeys have short and close fur colored black at the shoulders, yellow or orange fur along the back and extremities, and white on the face.

Squirrel monkeys have determined breeding seasons which involve large fluctuations in hormones and there is evidence of sexual dimorphism between males and females.

Squirrel monkeys can only sweat through the palms of their hands and feet. This can have the effect of making their hands and feet feel damp to the touch. Squirrel monkeys must make use of other thermoregulation techniques such as behavioral changes and urine washing. These monkeys live in habitats of high temperatures and high humidity, making it essential for them to maintain proper osmoregulation if conditions pass certain thresholds. Color vision studies have also been performed on squirrel monkeys for the purpose of better understanding vision ailments in humans.

The common squirrel monkey is commonly captured for the pet trade and for medical research, but it is not threatened. Two squirrel monkey species are endangered: the Central American squirrel monkey and the black squirrel monkey are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

== Evolutionary history ==
=== Taxonomy ===
Until 1984, all South American squirrel monkeys were considered part of a single widespread species, and many zoologists considered the Central American squirrel monkey to be a member of that single species as well. The two main groups currently recognized can be separated by the white above the eyes; it is shaped as a Gothic (&quot;pointed&quot;) arch in the &quot;S. sciureus&quot; group, while it is shaped as a Roman (&quot;rounded&quot;) arch in the &quot;S. boliviensis&quot; group. &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (2005) recognized five species. 

Subsequent taxonomic research has recognized &quot;Saimiri sciureus cassiquiarensis&quot; as a separate species &quot;Saimiri cassiquiarensis&quot;, and also recognized an additional species, Collins&#x27; squirrel monkey &quot;Saimiri collinsi&quot; that had previously been considered to be within &quot;S. sciureus&quot;. Some more recent taxonomies also recognize &quot;Saimiri sciureus macrodon&quot; as a separate species &quot;Saimiri macrodon&quot;, but others recognize &quot;S. macrodon&quot; to be a synonym of &quot;Saimiri cassiquiarensis&quot;.

=== Evolution ===
The crown group of the extant squirrel monkeys appears to have diverged around 1.5 million years ago. Diversification of squirrel monkey species appears to have occurred during the Pleistocene Epoch, likely due to climatic changes associated with interglacial periods in South America at the time. The origin of squirrel monkeys in Central America is unclear, but a possible hypothesis is human transport. More genetic work needs to be done on the subject to reveal a true answer.&quot;S. boliviensis&quot; appears to be the first diverging species in the group. &quot;S. oerstedii&quot; and &quot;S. s. sciureus,&quot; are sister species. &quot;S. s. macrodon&quot; is the sister species to the &quot;S. oerstedii&quot; / &quot;S. s. sciureus&quot; clade.

== Description ==
A squirrel monkey&#x27;s fur is short and close, coloured black at the shoulders and yellowish orange on its back and extremities. The upper parts of their heads are hairy. This black-and-white face gives them the name &quot;death&#x27;s head monkey&quot; in several Germanic languages (e.g., German , Swedish , Dutch ) and Slovenian ().

Squirrel monkeys grow from long, plus a tail. Male squirrel monkeys weigh . Females weigh . Both males and females are equipped with long and hairy tails, flat nails, and pointed claws.

Female squirrel monkeys have pseudo-penises, which they use to display dominance over smaller monkeys, in much the same way that the male squirrel monkeys display their dominance.

== Behaviour, ecology, and physiology ==
Like most of their New World monkey relatives, squirrel monkeys are diurnal and arboreal. Unlike other New World monkeys, their tail is not used for climbing but as a kind of &quot;balancing pole&quot; and also as a tool. Their movements in the branches can be very rapid.

Squirrel monkeys live together in multi-male/multi-female groups with up to 500 members. These large groups, however, can occasionally break into smaller troupes. The groups have a number of vocal calls, including warning sounds to protect the group from large falcons, which are a natural threat. Their small body size also makes them susceptible to predators such as snakes and felids. For marking territory, squirrel monkeys rub their tail and their skin with their own urine.

Squirrel monkeys are omnivores, eating primarily fruits and insects. Occasionally, they also eat seeds, leaves, flowers, buds, nuts, and eggs.
=== Reproduction ===
Squirrel monkey mating is subject to seasonal influences. Squirrel monkeys reach sexual maturity at ages of 2–2.5 years for females and age 3.5–4 years for males. Females give birth to young during the rainy season, after a 150- to 170-day gestation. Only the mothers care for the young. &quot;Saimiri oerstedti&quot; are weaned by 4 months of age, while &quot;S. boliviensis&quot; are not fully weaned until 18 months old. Squirrel monkeys live to about 15 years old in the wild, and over 20 years in captivity. Menopause in females probably occurs in the mid-teens. Studies show that &quot;Saimiri collinsi&quot; time the weaning of their young with the period of time when there will be maximum fruit availability in the environment. This reduces the energetic struggles that newly weaned juveniles will face when transitioning from a milk diet where they are dependent on their mother for food to a more diverse diet where they have to forage for food. There is evidence that squirrel monkeys show sexual dimorphism during the breeding season. In the months leading up to breeding and in the months of breeding, sexually mature adult males have been recorded to increase in size by significant amounts relative to females. These size changes are caused by seasonal fluctuations in androgen hormones synthesized in the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal and gonadal axes. The fluctuations include increases in the concentrations of testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone levels in sexually mature males during the breeding season, peaking in January. Following the breeding season, these androgen concentrations drop. The evolutionary reasoning for these size changes in sexually mature males is suggested to be both intra-sexual selections among males and also female choice selection, as the larger males are more likely to be preferred by females and partake in more copulations. There is not clear evidence yet as to why females choose larger males, but a leading hypothesis is that the larger males are more likely to have better vigilance for their young.

=== Thermoregulation ===
Squirrel monkeys can only sweat through the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Sweating in these areas alone does not provide enough cooling for the monkeys to survive in the high temperature environments of South and Central America, requiring them to use other methods to thermoregulate. They will use behavioral tactics such as seeking out shaded areas sheltered from the sun and also make use of postural changes to better dissipate heat from their body. They will also make use of a technique to maximize evaporative cooling known as urine washing. The monkeys will urinate on their hands and rub the urine over the soles of their feet. The urine is then evaporated off the body in a cooling process. Studies have shown this behavior to be maximized during times of high temperature, highlighting its importance as a thermoregulatory behavior.

=== Osmoregulation ===
Squirrel monkeys are subject to both high temperatures and high humidity in their natural habitat. The humidity can range from 70% saturation in the &#x27;dry&#x27; season up to 90% in the &#x27;wet&#x27; season. Squirrel monkeys are able to tolerate up to 75% humidity with small adjustments in behavior and physiology that increase in significance as the humidity goes up. When reaching approximately 95% humidity, the monkeys have more drastic changes in osmoregulation in order to maintain homeostasis. As evaporative water loss decreases at these high levels of saturation, the monkeys will take in less water and create a more concentrated urine in order to maintain proper ion and water levels inside the body.

=== Cooperation studies ===
Cooperation is largely evident in human primates. Squirrel monkeys do not often display cooperation in the wild, while many other nonhuman primates do. Studies have been done to suggest that female squirrel monkeys show disadvantageous inequity aversion as it pertains to food rewards. However, the same could not be said for male squirrel monkeys. More studies need to be done on squirrel monkey behavior to determine why squirrel monkeys rarely show cooperation, and whether disadvantageous inequity aversion is a relevant factor.

=== Colour vision ===

Colour vision in squirrel monkeys has been extensively studied as a stand-in for human ailments. In humans, two genes for colour vision are found on the X chromosome. Typically, one gene (OPN1LW) produces a pigment that is most sensitive to the 564 nm wavelength, while the other gene (OPN1MW) produces a pigment most sensitive to 534 nm. In squirrel monkeys, there is only one gene on the X chromosome but it exists in three varieties: one is most sensitive to 538 nm, one to 551 nm, and one to 561 nm. Since males have only one X chromosome, they are dichromatic, although with different sensitivities. Females have two X chromosomes, so some of them can have copies of two different alleles. The three alleles seem to be equally common, leading to one-third of females being dichromatic, while two-thirds are trichromatic. Recently, gene therapy has given the human OPN1LW gene to adult male squirrel monkeys, producing behaviour consistent with trichromatic colour vision.

<doc id="1239472" wikidata="Q104486" url="?curid=1239472" title="Eccentricity (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the eccentricity of a conic section is a non-negative real number that uniquely characterizes its shape.
One can think of the eccentricity as a measure of how much a conic section deviates from being circular. In particular:
* The eccentricity of a circle is 0.
* The eccentricity of a non-circular ellipse is between 0 and 1.
* The eccentricity of a parabola is 1.
* The eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1.
* The eccentricity of a pair of lines is formula_1

Two conic sections with the same eccentricity are similar.

==Definitions==
Any conic section can be defined as the locus of points whose distances to a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix) are in a constant ratio. That ratio is called the &quot;eccentricity&quot;, commonly denoted as .

The eccentricity can also be defined in terms of the intersection of a plane and a double-napped cone associated with the conic section. If the cone is oriented with its axis vertical, the eccentricity is

:formula_2
where &quot;β&quot; is the angle between the plane and the horizontal and α is the angle between the cone&#x27;s slant generator and the horizontal. For formula_3 the plane section is a circle, for formula_4 a parabola. (The plane must not meet the vertex of the cone.)

The linear eccentricity of an ellipse or hyperbola, denoted (or sometimes or ), is the distance between its center and either of its two foci. The eccentricity can be defined as the ratio of the linear eccentricity to the semimajor axis : that is, formula_5 (lacking a center, the linear eccentricity for parabolas is not defined). It is worth to note that a parabola can be treated as an ellipse or a hyperbola, but with one focal point at infinity.

==Alternative names==

The eccentricity is sometimes called the first eccentricity to distinguish it from the second eccentricity and third eccentricity defined for ellipses (see below). The eccentricity is also sometimes called the numerical eccentricity.

In the case of ellipses and hyperbolas the linear eccentricity is sometimes called the half-focal separation.

==Notation==
Three notational conventions are in common use:
# for the eccentricity and for the linear eccentricity.
# for the eccentricity and for the linear eccentricity.
# or for the eccentricity and for the linear eccentricity (mnemonic for half-&quot;f&quot;ocal separation).
This article uses the first notation.

==Values==

===Standard form===
Here, for the ellipse and the hyperbola, is the length of the semi-major axis and is the length of the semi-minor axis.

===General form===

When the conic section is given in the general quadratic form

:formula_6

the following formula gives the eccentricity if the conic section is not a parabola (which has eccentricity equal to 1), not a degenerate hyperbola or degenerate ellipse, and not an imaginary ellipse:

:formula_7

where formula_8 if the determinant of the 3×3 matrix

:formula_9

is negative or formula_10 if that determinant is positive.

==Ellipses==

The eccentricity of an ellipse is strictly less than 1. When circles (which have eccentricity 0) are counted as ellipses, the eccentricity of an ellipse is greater than or equal to 0; if circles are given a special category and are excluded from the category of ellipses, then the eccentricity of an ellipse is strictly greater than 0.

For any ellipse, let be the length of its semi-major axis and be the length of its semi-minor axis. In the coordinate system with origin at the ellipse&#x27;s center and -axis aligned with the major axis, points on the ellipse satisfy the equation

:formula_11

with foci at coordinates formula_12 for formula_13

We define a number of related additional concepts (only for ellipses):


===Other formulae for the eccentricity of an ellipse===

The eccentricity of an ellipse is, most simply, the ratio of the linear eccentricity (distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus) to the length of the semimajor axis .

:formula_14

The eccentricity is also the ratio of the semimajor axis to the distance from the center to the directrix:

:formula_15

The eccentricity can be expressed in terms of the flattening (defined as formula_16 for semimajor axis and semiminor axis ):
:formula_17
(Flattening may be denoted by in some subject areas if is linear eccentricity.)

Define the maximum and minimum radii formula_18 and formula_19 as the maximum and minimum distances from either focus to the ellipse (that is, the distances from either focus to the two ends of the major axis). Then with semimajor axis , the eccentricity is given by

:formula_20

which is the distance between the foci divided by the length of the major axis.

==Hyperbolas==

The eccentricity of a hyperbola can be any real number greater than 1, with no upper bound. The eccentricity of a rectangular hyperbola is formula_21.

==Quadrics==

The eccentricity of a three-dimensional quadric is the eccentricity of a designated section of it. For example, on a triaxial ellipsoid, the &quot;meridional eccentricity&quot; is that of the ellipse formed by a section containing both the longest and the shortest axes (one of which will be the polar axis), and the &quot;equatorial eccentricity&quot; is the eccentricity of the ellipse formed by a section through the centre, perpendicular to the polar axis (i.e. in the equatorial plane). But: conic sections may occur on surfaces of higher order, too (see image).

==Celestial mechanics==

In celestial mechanics, for bound orbits in a spherical potential, the definition above is informally generalized. When the apocenter distance is close to the pericenter distance, the orbit is said to have low eccentricity; when they are very different, the orbit is said be eccentric or having eccentricity near unity. This definition coincides with the mathematical definition of eccentricity for ellipses, in Keplerian, i.e., formula_22 potentials.

== Analogous classifications ==

A number of classifications in mathematics use derived terminology from the classification of conic sections by eccentricity:
*Classification of elements of SL2(R) as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic – and similarly for classification of elements of PSL2(R), the real Möbius transformations.
*Classification of discrete distributions by variance-to-mean ratio; see cumulants of some discrete probability distributions for details.
*Classification of partial differential equations is by analogy with the conic sections classification; see elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations.

<doc id="1239477" wikidata="Q50013" url="?curid=1239477" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">
<text>Eccentricity (also called quirkiness) is an unusual or odd behavior on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary, without being demonstrably maladaptive. Eccentricity is contrasted with normal behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and pursue certain priorities in everyday life. People who consistently display benignly eccentric behavior are labeled as &quot;eccentrics&quot;.

==Etymology==
From Medieval Latin &quot;eccentricus&quot;, derived from Greek &#x27;, &quot;out of the center&quot;, from &#x27;-, &#x27;- &quot;out of&quot; + &#x27;, &quot;center&quot;. &quot;Eccentric&quot; first appeared in English essays as a neologism in 1551, as an astronomical term meaning &quot;a circle in which the earth, sun, etc. deviates from its center.&quot; (See Orbital eccentricity.) Five years later, in 1556, an adjective form of the word was used. In 1685, the definition evolved from the literal to the figurative, and &quot;eccentric&quot; is noted to have begun being used to describe unconventional or odd behavior. A noun form of the word – a person who possesses and exhibits these unconventional or odd qualities and behaviors – appeared by 1832.

==Depictions==
Eccentricity is often associated with genius, intellectual giftedness, or creativity. People may perceive the individual&#x27;s eccentric behavior as the outward expression of their unique intelligence or creative impulse. In this vein, the eccentric&#x27;s habits are incomprehensible not because they are illogical or the result of madness, but because they stem from a mind so original that it cannot be conformed to societal norms. English utilitarian thinker John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) wrote that &quot;the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained&quot;, and mourned a lack of eccentricity as &quot;the chief danger of the time&quot;. Edith Sitwell (1887–1964) wrote that eccentricity is &quot;often a kind of innocent pride&quot;, also saying that geniuses and aristocrats are called eccentrics because &quot;they are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd&quot;. Eccentricity is also associated with great wealth — what would be considered signs of insanity in a poor person, some may accept as eccentricity in wealthy people.

==Comparison to considerations of normality==

A person who is simply in a &quot;&quot; situation is not, by the strictest definition, an eccentric since (presumably) they may be ordinary by the conventions of their native environment.

Eccentrics may or may not comprehend the standards for normal behavior in their culture. They are simply unconcerned by society&#x27;s disapproval of their habits or beliefs.

Some eccentrics are pejoratively considered &quot;cranks&quot; rather than geniuses. Eccentric behavior is often considered whimsical or quirky, although it can also be strange and disturbing. Many individuals previously considered merely eccentric, such as aviation magnate Howard Hughes, have recently been retrospectively diagnosed as having had mental disorders (obsessive–compulsive disorder in Hughes&#x27; case).

Other people may have an eccentric taste in clothes, or eccentric hobbies or collections they pursue with great vigor. They may have a pedantic and precise manner of speaking, intermingled with inventive wordplay. Many of these behaviors share the characteristics of someone with an autistic spectrum disorder, such as the eccentric hobbies or the pedantic speech.

Many individuals may even manifest eccentricities consciously and deliberately in an attempt to differentiate themselves from societal norms or enhance a sense of inimitable identity. Given the overwhelmingly positive stereotypes (at least in popular culture and especially with fictional characters) often associated with eccentricity, as detailed above, certain individuals seek to be associated with this sort of character type. However, this is not always successful as eccentric individuals are not necessarily charismatic and the individual in question may simply be dismissed by others as just seeking attention.

===Characteristics===
Psychologist David Weeks believes people with a mental illness suffer from their behavior, while eccentrics are quite happy. He even opines that eccentrics are &quot;less&quot; prone to mental illness than everyone else.

According to Weeks&#x27; study, there are several distinctive characteristics that often differentiate a healthy eccentric person from a regular person or someone who has a mental illness. The first five characteristics on Weeks&#x27; list are found in most people regarded as eccentric:

* Nonconforming
* Creative
* Strongly motivated by curiosity
* Idealistic
* Happily obsessed with one or more hobbies (usually five or six)

Weeks also lists characteristics that some, but not all, eccentric people may exhibit:
* Aware from early childhood that they are different
* Intelligent
* Opinionated and outspoken
* Noncompetitive, not in need of reassurance or reinforcement from society
* Unusual in their eating habits and living arrangements
* Not interested in the opinions or company of other people
* Mischievous sense of humor
* Single
* Usually the eldest or an only child
* Bad speller

<text>The Netscape Portable Runtime, or NSPR, is a cross-platform abstraction layer library for the C programming language. It provides a uniform API for various operating system functions.

== History ==
NSPR was originally designed to provide a base for the Java virtual machine in Netscape 5. Over time it was extended to allow support for additional functionality used for Netscape&#x27;s server and client software. NSPR continues to be used today by Firefox as well as many of Oracle and Red Hat&#x27;s server products.

== Features ==

=== Threads ===
NSPR provides a thread API. It uses the OS&#x27;s threading capabilities where possible. It also provides support for sharing memory between threads, as well as creating and using thread pools.
Locks, atomics, semaphores, and both cached and uncached monitors are provided.

=== I/O ===
NSPR provides functions for working with files, directories, anonymous pipes and network sockets.

=== Network addresses ===
NSPR defines an IP-centric network address object. Functions are provided to translate ASCII strings (DNS names) into NSPR&#x27;s network address structures, regardless of whether the addressing technology uses IPv4 or IPv6.

=== Time ===
NSPR makes timing facilities available in two forms: interval timing and calendar functions.

Interval timers are based on a free running 32-bit resolution timer. Their epoch and interval can be set as needed.

Calendar times are represented using 64-bit signed Unix time. NSPR provides functions for manipulating and converting timestamps.

=== Memory management ===
NSPR provides API to perform the basic malloc, calloc, realloc and free functions. Depending on the platform, the functions may be implemented almost entirely in the NSPR runtime or simply shims that call immediately into the host operating system&#x27;s offerings.

=== Linking ===
Support for linking (shared library loading and unloading) forms part of NSPR&#x27;s feature set. In most cases this is simply a smoothing over of the facilities offered by the various platform providers.

=== Data structures ===
NSPR provides implementations of a circular linked list and a hash table.

<doc id="1239484" wikidata="Q1546545" url="?curid=1239484" title="Grievous bodily harm">
<text>Assault occasioning grievous bodily harm (often abbreviated to GBH) is a term used in English criminal law to describe the severest forms of battery. It refers to two offences that are created by sections 18 and 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The distinction between these two sections is the requirement of specific intent for section 18; the offence under section 18 is variously referred to as &quot;wounding with intent&quot; or &quot;causing grievous bodily harm with intent&quot;, whereas the offence under section 20 is variously referred to as &quot;unlawful wounding&quot;, &quot;malicious wounding&quot; or &quot;inflicting grievous bodily harm&quot;.

==Statute==

===Section 18===
This section now reads:

The words omitted in the first to third places specifically included shooting or attempting to shoot, and included some words considered redundant; they were repealed by section 10(2) of, and Part III of Schedule 3 to, the Criminal Law Act 1967.

The words omitted in the penultimate place (&quot;at the discretion of the court&quot;) were repealed by the Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1893.

The words omitted at the end were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892 (words limiting penal servitude to at least three years, or imprisonment to at most two years, and removing mention of hard labour) and the Statute Law Revision (No. 2) Act 1893 (words prescribing imprisonment as an alternative to penal servitude).

This section replaces section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837, which in turn replaced section 12 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828, which in turn replaced section 1 of Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act (1803).

===Section 20===
In England and Wales, section 20 now reads:

The words omitted were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892, as for section 18.

In Northern Ireland, it reads:

This was subject to the same omissions as in England; the Criminal Justice (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 enacted the other amendments.

===Interpretation===

====Felony====
The distinction between felony and misdemeanor was abolished by the Criminal Law Act 1967. Accordingly, &quot;guilty of felony&quot; is to be read as &quot;guilty of an offence&quot;. The Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 provided the same for Northern Ireland, until the 1861 Act was amended in 2004 to update the formulation.

====Penal servitude====

Penal servitude was abolished by the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. Accordingly, the phrase &quot;penal servitude&quot; is to be read as &quot;imprisonment&quot;.

==The offences==
None of the words used in these sections are defined elsewhere in the Act, but they have been defined by case law.

===Wound===

For this purpose, a wound is an injury that breaks the continuity of the skin. There must be a division of the whole skin and not merely a division of the cuticle or upper layer.

A single drop of blood is sufficient, but it must fall outside the body: see &quot;JJC (a minor) v. Eisenhower&quot; (1984) 78 Cr App R 48. In this case, a pellet gun was fired at the victim. The bullet ruptured blood vessels above his eye, causing his eye to fill with fluid. Lord Justice Robert Goff said the rupturing of blood vessels is an internal wound; only the breaking of whole skin would warrant a wounding charge.

A bruise or internal rupturing of blood vessels is not a wound, and neither is a broken bone.

Wounding does not imply the use of a weapon; a kick may be wounding.

Grievous bodily harm means &quot;really serious bodily harm&quot;: &quot;DPP v Smith&quot; [1961] AC 290, HL; &quot;R v Cunningham&quot; [1982] AC 566, HL; &quot;R v Brown (A)&quot; [1994] 1 AC 212, HL; &quot;R v Brown and Stratton&quot; [1998] Crim LR 485, CA. It encompasses a range of injuries: &quot;R v Woodland&quot; (2007) 48 MVR 360.

However, &quot;R v Saunders&quot; [1985] Crim LR 230, [1985] LS Gaz R 1005, allows &quot;serious injury&quot; as a sufficient direction to the jury. It is for the judge to decide whether the word &quot;really&quot; needs to be used in their direction to the jury: &quot;R v Janjua and Choudhury&quot; [1999] 1 Cr App R 91, The Times, 8 May 1998, CA (in this case, as a knife with a blade at least inches long had been used, it was not possible that something less than really serious harm was intended).

===Inflict and cause===
In &quot;R v Martin&quot;, shortly before the conclusion of a performance at a theatre, the defendant put out the lights on a staircase which a large number of persons had to descend in order to leave the theatre, and he also obstructed the exit by placing an iron bar across a doorway which they had in leaving to pass, and upon the lights being thus extinguished, a large proportion of the audience were seized by panic and rushed in fright down the staircase forcing those in front against the iron bar; he &quot;inflicted&quot; injuries which resulted by reason of the pressure and struggling of the crowd thus created on the staircase.

David Ormerod said that the effect of the decision in &quot;R v Gibbins and Proctor&quot; appears to be that the offence of causing grievous bodily harm under section 18 can be committed by an omission.

In &quot;R v Mandair&quot;, Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC said, with the agreement of the majority of the House of Lords, &quot;In my opinion ... the word &#x27;cause&#x27; is wider or at least not narrower than the word &#x27;inflict.

In &quot;R v Burstow, R v Ireland&quot;, it was held that an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 can be committed where no physical violence is applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim.

Lord Hope of Craighead said &quot;the word &#x27;inflict&#x27; implies that the consequence of the act is something which the victim is likely to find unpleasant or harmful.&quot; He said that, in the context of a criminal act, the words &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;inflict&quot; may be taken to be interchangeable.

Lord Steyn described the actions of Burstow as follows: &quot;During an eight-month period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of harassment. He made some silent telephone calls to her. He also made abusive calls to her. He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a note which was intended to be menacing, and was so understood.&quot;

Neither offence requires that a common assault be committed.

====1983 to 1997====
In &quot;R v Wilson, R v Jenkins&quot;, Lord Roskill said:
====Before 1983====
In &quot;R v Clarence&quot;, it appeared that at a time when the prisoner knew, but his wife did not know, that he was suffering from gonorrhoea, he had &quot;connection&quot; with her; that the result was that the disease was communicated to her, and that had she been aware of the prisoner&#x27;s condition she would not have submitted to the intercourse.

Clarence&#x27;s conviction under section 20 was quashed by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved by a majority of 9 to 4. Wills, A. L. Smith, and Stephen JJ specifically said that they thought the disease had not been inflicted within the meaning of the word &quot;inflict&quot; in section 20. Mathew J said that he agreed with Stephen. Stephen said that he had been informed that Grantham J agreed with him. Huddleston B said that he thoroughly agreed with Stephen. Lord Coleridge CJ said that he agreed with all or almost all of what Wills and Stephen said. Hawkins J specifically said that he thought it had been inflicted within the meaning of the word &quot;inflict&quot; in section 20.

Wills J said (footnotes have been included in the body of the text, indicated by &quot;(1)&quot;):

Stephen J said:

A. L. Smith J said &quot;it appears to me that this offence cannot be committed unless an assault has in fact been committed, and indeed this has been so held&quot;.

Hawkins J said that he thought that the contention that bodily harm cannot be legally said to be &quot;inflicted&quot; unless it has been brought about by some act amounting to an assault was untenable.

===Maliciously===
In &quot;R v Mowatt&quot;, Lord Diplock said:

Therefore, the defendant must at least be reckless as to whether some harm, albeit not necessarily serious harm, is likely to be caused (see &quot;R v Savage, DPP v Parmenter&quot;), but a mere intention to frighten is not enough (see &quot;R v Sullivan&quot;).

In &quot;R v Sullivan&quot; [1981] Crim LR 46, CA, the appellant was tried on charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The victim said that the appellant and a companion were drunk. He said that while he was in a street that was eight feet wide and had a narrow pavement, the appellant drove a car through that street at twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, mounted the pavement and injured him. The appellant denied that he was the driver of the car in a written statement to the police and said he could add nothing to that statement in an unsworn statement from the dock. However, during his closing speech, counsel for the defence suggested that all the appellant intended to do was frighten the victim and no more. The jury were directed that if there was an intention to frighten, and injury took place as a result, the appellant was guilty of an offence under section 20. The appellant was acquitted of the offence under section 18, but convicted of offences under section 20. The Court of Appeal held that an intention to frighten was not enough to constitute the necessary &quot;mens rea&quot; for section 20, and that the direction to the contrary effect was a misdirection. However, they dismissed the appellant&#x27;s appeal. They said that a properly directed jury could not in the circumstances have come to any other conclusion than that the appellant must have been aware that what he was doing was likely to cause physical injury to the victim.

In practice, malice in the case of these offences means no more than foresight of the risk of bodily harm: &quot;R v Barnes&quot; [2005] 1 Cr App R 30.

===Specific intent===
Section 18 has two separate &quot;mens rea&quot; requirements and is therefore an offence of specific rather than basic intent. In &quot;R v Belfon&quot; [1976] 1 WLR 741, the Court of Appeal confirmed that references to mere foresight or recklessness that harm was likely to result are sufficient for the element &quot;unlawfully and maliciously inflict/cause&quot; for the basic intent in both sections 18 and 20 but insufficient for the specific element. The intention either to cause or to resist arrest must be proved subjectively, say, in the charge &quot;malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm&quot;.

The Crown Prosecution Service says that the following factors may be evidence of intention:

===Alternative verdicts===

Sections 20 and 47 are offences of basic intent and can be an alternative charge to section 18, and/or section 47 is a lesser included offence.

===Consent===
Consent is only an allowed defence to either section if there is considered to be a good reason. This may include medical operations, sport, tattooing (even if carried out by someone who is not trained), and, occasionally, &quot;&quot;.

Body Modification, when outside of &#x27;tattooing, piercing or other body adornment&#x27;, is not able to be consented to.

&quot;R v Brown (Anthony)&quot; however ruled that sadomasochistic sexual acts are not a good reason to allow a defence of consent. This decision was approved in s.71 Domestic Abuse Act 2021. This comes with the exception where (a) The Serious Harm consists of, or is a result of the infection of the victim with a sexually transmitted infection, and (b) that V consented to the sexual activity in the knowledge or belief that the defendant had the sexually transmitted infection.

The relevant case to this exception is &quot;R v Dica&quot; in which it was held that infection with an STD consists of Grievous Bodily Harm when one is aware they posess the disease and is reckless to its transmission. Both parties must be aware of the disease for infection to be consensual.

===Attempt===
According to the CPS, in relation to the offence of attempted GBH, &quot;It is not possible to attempt [a Section 20] offence because in order to attempt it, the consequence (wounding or GBH) must be intended, which is an offence contrary to section 18 instead.&quot;

Causing death, even accidentally, in the course of attempting a section 18 offence is murder, not manslaughter. Attempted murder nonetheless requires the specific intent to kill.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, the offence under section 18 is an indictable-only offence, while the offence under section 20 is triable either way.

==Sentence==

===Section 18===
In England and Wales, an offence under section 18 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.

See the Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual for case law on sentencing of section 18 . Relevant cases are:

*&quot;AG&#x27;s Ref No 14 of 2008 (Cook)&quot; [2009] 1 Cr App R (S) 62
*&quot;AG&#x27;s Ref No 44 of 2008 (Patterson)&quot; [2009] 1 Cr App R (S) 111

*&quot;R v Chatburn&quot; [2010] EWCA Crim 115
*&quot;Haystead&quot; [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 107

In Northern Ireland, an offence under section 18 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.

===Section 20===
In England and Wales, a person guilty of an offence under section 20 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.

Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence under section 20, other than an offence for which the sentence falls to be imposed under section 227 or 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the court, if not precluded from sentencing an offender by its exercise of some other power, may impose a fine instead of or in addition to dealing with him in any other way in which the court has power to deal with him, subject however to any enactment requiring the offender to be dealt with in a particular way.

An offence under section 20 is a specified offence for the purposes of chapter 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 because it is a specified violent offence. It is not a serious offence for the purposes of that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable in the case of a person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more. This means that sections 227 and 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of an offence under section 20, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.

See the Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual for case law on sentencing of section 20 

The following cases are relevant to section 20:
*&quot;R v Robertson&quot; [1997] EWCA Crim 918 (16 April 1997), 1 Cr App R (S) 21
*&quot;R v Byrne&quot; [1997] EWCA Crim 1174 (13 May 1997), 1 Cr App R (S) 105
*&quot;R v McNellis&quot; [2000] 1 Cr App R (S) 481
*&quot;R v Clare&quot; [2002] 2 Cr App R (S) 97
*&quot;R v Foote&quot; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 5
*&quot;Hall&quot; [2008] EWCA 1208

*&quot;Abdile&quot; [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 18
*&quot;Kee&quot; [2010] 1 Cr App R (S) 64

In Northern Ireland, a person guilty of an offence under section 20 is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.

==Racially or religiously aggravated offence==

In England and Wales, section 29(1)(a) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (c 37) creates the distinct offence of racially or religiously aggravated wounding or infliction of bodily harm. This is an aggravated version of the offence under section 20.

<text>Water torture encompasses a variety of techniques using water to inflict physical or psychological harm on a victim as a form of torture or execution.

==Forced ingestion==

In this form of water torture, water is forced down the throat and into the stomach. It was used as a legal torture and execution method by the courts in France in the 17th and 18th centuries. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century it was used against Filipinos by American Forces during the Philippine–American War and was employed against British Commonwealth, American and Chinese prisoners of war during World War II by the Japanese. The Human Rights Watch organization reports that in the 2000s, security forces in Uganda sometimes forced a detainee to lie face up under an open water spigot.

Water intoxication can result from drinking too much water. This has caused some fatalities over the years in fraternities in North America during initiation week. For example, a person was hazed to death by Chi Tau (local) of Chico State (California) in 2005 via the forcing of pushups and the drinking of water from a bottle.

==Waterboarding==
==Chinese water torture==
==Dunking==
==Other forms==
*Supposedly, the Rasphuis in Amsterdam, a 17th-century institution that attempted to rehabilitate young male criminals through labor, contained a &quot;water dungeon&quot;, the so-called &quot;Waterhuis&quot;. If prisoners refused to work, they were placed in a cellar that quickly filled with water after a sluice was opened and were handed a pump that enabled them to keep from drowning. Geert Mak and other authors, however, point out that there is no evidence for the existence of this room.
* In the 1970s at Bautzen Prison in the German Democratic Republic there was a punishment cell that filled up with water up to a red light which a large prisoner described as at nose level if he is on tip toes. 
* In the 20th century, various U.S. newspapers published details of &quot;water torture&quot; (or the &quot;torture of thirst&quot;) in Japan which involved subjecting the victim to a high salt diet for several days, without rice or water, and then offering them water in exchange for a confession: &quot;it is difficult to imagine a more cruel device.&quot;

<text>In Canadian politics, a Quebec lieutenant () is a Quebec politician who is selected by the party leader to be his or her main advisor and/or spokesperson on issues specific to Quebec. This is particularly the case when the leader is an anglophone, though several francophone leaders have also had Quebec lieutenants. It is typically filled by a Member of Parliament or at least a current or former candidate for Parliament. The position is usually a well-known but often an unofficial assignment, and has no official legal status.

==Notable Quebec lieutenants==
Some past and current Quebec lieutenants include:

===Liberal===
===Conservative (1867–1942)===
===Progressive Conservative===
===Reform===
===Canadian Alliance===
===Conservative (2004–present)===

<text>A leadership school is an organization, or entity within an organization, that provides education that focuses on the development of leaders. 

This activity can be undertaken at different levels. It can be in the form of training, seminars, institutes, or more comprehensive frameworks that lead to the awarding of a certificate, degree, or diploma.
The leadership curriculum is intended to shape leadership behavior, and the approach used in developing the curriculum can vary, depending on the beliefs of the founders. These things potentially make leadership have a rich and broad meaning, which can also make it difficult for people who want to study leadership to find common ground. 

==History ==

While theorists and practitioners in the United States in the 19th and early-20th centuries developed the field that they called &quot;management&quot;, socialists in Europe founded schools for their prospective leadership cadres. Lenin established the Longjumeau Party School near Paris in 1911 to train Bolshevik leaders.
The International Lenin School of the Comintern operated from 1926, training international students in communist theory and operation and its organization.

In the Third Reich (1933-1945) in Germany, the Nazi Party fostered élite schools, among which the National Political Institutes of Education or &quot;Napola&quot;, the Adolf Hitler Schools and the Reichsschule Feldafing in particular trained prospective National Socialist leaders.

<doc id="1239505" wikidata="Q123359" url="?curid=1239505" title="Heinz Holliger">
<text>Heinz Robert Holliger (born 21 May 1939) is a Swiss composer, virtuoso oboist, and conductor. Celebrated for his versatility and technique, Holliger is among the most prominent oboists of his generation. His repertoire includes Baroque and Classical pieces, but he has regularly engaged in lesser known pieces of Romantic music, as well as his own compositions. He often performed contemporary works with his wife, the harpist Ursula Holliger. Many composers have written works for him, including Messiaen, Berio, Carter, Henze, Krenek, Lutosławski, Martin, Penderecki, Stockhausen and Yun. A noted composer himself, Hollinger has written works such as the opera &quot;Schneewittchen&quot; (1998).

==Biography==
Holliger was born in Langenthal, Switzerland. An oboist since age eleven, he studied at the conservatory of Bern before taking first prize in oboe at the Geneva International Music Competition in 1959. In 1966, he began teaching at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg. 

He has become one of the world&#x27;s most celebrated oboists. Many composers have written works for him, including Luciano Berio, Elliott Carter, Hans Werner Henze, Ernst Krenek, Witold Lutosławski, Frank Martin, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henri Pousseur, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Sándor Veress and Isang Yun.

In 1972, Maurice Bourgue (oboe), Klaus Thunemann (bassoon), Christiane Jaccottet (continuo), Holliger, and others recorded Jan Dismas Zelenka&#x27;s Six Trio Sonatas for oboe and bassoon. This recording is credited for the &quot;Zelenka Renaissance&quot;.

He was married to the harpist Ursula Holliger, Hänggi (1937–2014).

==Music==

Having studied composition with Sándor Veress and Pierre Boulez, he has composed many works in a variety of genres, and many of his works have been recorded for the ECM label. Holliger was invited by Walter Fink to be the 17th composer featured in the 2007 Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival, where he conducted Claude Debussy&#x27;s and Robert Schumann&#x27;s music as well as his own &quot;Lieder&quot; (which set Georg Trakl poems) and &quot;Gesänge der Frühe&quot; (which set Friedrich Hölderlin and Schumann texts).

For New Music patron Paul Sacher&#x27;s 70th birthday, Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich asked twelve composers, Sacher&#x27;s friends, to write music for solo cello using the Sacher hexachord. (This musical cryptogram is eS, A, C, H, E, and Re, or &quot;Sacher&quot; spelled with German words for the pitch classes.) Holliger contributed a chaconne. Some of the compositions were premiered in Zurich on 2 May 1976. Czech cellist František Brikcius gave the entire &quot;eSACHERe&quot; project its premiere in Prague during May 2011.

<text>SS &quot;Empire Peacemaker&quot; was a British convoy rescue ship that served at the end of World War II, originally laid down as the corvette . Post-war she served as an Army transport ship before being scrapped in 1955.

==Ship history==
The ship was ordered from Fleming &amp; Ferguson Ltd. of Paisley on 23 January 1943 as a . She was launched on 8 September 1944 as &quot;Scarborough Castle&quot; (K536), but further work was then cancelled, and she was eventually completed as a convoy rescue ship in January 1945. Under the ownership of the Ministry of War Transport, and managed by the Ellerman City Line, she sailed on eight convoys between early February and the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. During that time she rescued three survivors from an aircraft which had overrun the flight deck of the MAC ship .

Post-war she was transferred to the Transport Branch of the Royal Army Service Corps for service as a troop transport. In October 1945 she sailed from the Clyde to Arkhangelsk to repatriate a Royal Navy Shore Party. In January 1946 she made three voyages between Southampton and St. Helier, Jersey, carrying returning service personnel.

In 1952 &quot;Empire Peacemaker&quot;, &quot;Empire Shelter&quot; and &quot;Empire Lifeguard&quot; provided a shuttle ferry service for Army personnel between Port Said, Egypt, and Famagusta, Cyprus, as well as making occasional troop movement voyages to Libya and Malta.

&quot;Empire Peacemaker&quot; was finally laid up at Falmouth, Cornwall, in 1954. In July 1955 she was sold to a Belgian shipbreaker and was towed to Antwerp, and was broken up by Jos de Smedt in Burght in December.

===Convoys===
&quot;Empire Peacemaker&quot; sailed on the following convoys:
* OS/KMS-110KM — River Clyde to Gibraltar (February 1945)
* MKS-82G — Gibraltar to Liverpool (February 1945)
* OS/KMS-114KM — Southend to Gibraltar (March 1945)
* MKS-86G — Gibraltar to Liverpool (March 1945)
* OS/KMS-118KM — Clyde to Gibraltar (March 1945)
* MKS-90G — Gibraltar to Liverpool (March 1945)
* ON-296 — Liverpool to New York City (April 1945)
* HX-354 — New York City to Liverpool (May 1945)

<doc id="1239514" wikidata="Q736958" url="?curid=1239514" title="Persistent world">
<text>A persistent world or persistent state world (PSW) is a virtual world which, by the definition given by Richard Bartle, &quot;continues to exist and develop internally even when there are no people interacting with it&quot;. The first virtual worlds were text-based and often called MUDs, but the term is frequently used in relation to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and pervasive games. Examples of persistent worlds that exist in video games include &quot;Battle Dawn&quot;, &quot;EVE Online&quot;, and &quot;Realms of Trinity&quot;.

A persistent world can be achieved by developing and maintaining a single or dynamic instance state of the game world that is shared and viewed by all players around the clock. The persistence of a world can be subdivided into &quot;game persistence&quot;, &quot;world persistence&quot; and &quot;data persistence&quot;. Data persistence ensures that any world data is not lost in the event of computer system failure. World persistence means the world continues to exist and is available to players when they want to access it. Game persistence refers to the persistence of game events within the world (a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; MUD is a virtual world where the entire (game) world is reset periodically). When referring to a &quot;persistent world&quot;, world and game persistence are sometimes used interchangeably. The persistence criterion is the trait that separates virtual worlds from other types of video games.

== Pervasive games ==
The real world is persistent. The game world of a pervasive game takes place in the real world and so pervasive games are also persistent. In other words, pervasive games share the persistence trait with virtual worlds. An example of a pervasive game that makes heavy use of a virtual world is &quot;Can You See Me Now?&quot;, where street runners exist in a virtual world while simultaneously running around the real physical world; the game was persistent during play, as well as the virtual world.

== Simulated persistence ==
To give the illusion that the game world is always available, persistence can be simulated. This can be achieved by scheduling when players are allowed to play, around times when the world is offline, or as in the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series, having the game generate events that could have happened during the period of inactivity. Aside from virtual worlds, the simulation of a persistent world is also possible in single player games. In &quot;Noctis&quot;, players are advised to turn off the game while refueling because it takes so long. In addition, if a player who has landed on a planet stops playing and then after a while resumes, he or she can see visible changes in the sea level or the daytime/nighttime cycle. 

A form of simulated persistence referred to as &quot;pseudo-persistence&quot; has been used in both video games and pervasive games. Pseudo-persistence means making relevant world data available when the relevant players reconnect to the world instance. In a mobile game, a virtual world might exist on a distributed collection of mobile devices. If a player reconnects to a device they previously connected to, they find that their relevant world data is still present. In the video game &quot;Destiny&quot;, a World Server provides the persistent world data for the game instances (called &quot;bubbles&quot;), which are created on demand as a number of players are matched to play the game together.. The term &#x27;persistent world&#x27; is frequently used by players of &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; (2002) and &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; (2006) to refer to MMORPG-like online environments created using the toolkit.

== First virtual worlds ==
The first multi-player game to demonstrate on-line persistence was the text-based MUD1 written in 1978 by Rob Trubshaw and Richard Bartle. Initially only available for a few hours in off-peak time at Essex University, UK, it featured a world reset every 105 minutes. Nevertheless, it persisted independent of players logging in for the time it was running. The subsequent decade saw many on-line worlds clone this template, but all featured variations on timed resets and reboots or did not allow players to retain objects within the game other than running point totals such as treasure or experience points as a marker of progress.

&quot;&quot; can be considered the first game to introduce a true persistent state world in 1989. Avalon pioneered the ability for items to be retained by the player whilst offline while the Avalon realm at large continued 24/7 with only a morning backup to mark the world pausing briefly. It is currently the longest running online virtual world.

<doc id="1239518" wikidata="Q4255281" url="?curid=1239518" title="Walter LaFeber">
<text>Walter Fredrick LaFeber (August 30, 1933March 9, 2021) was an American academic who served as the Andrew H. and James S. Tisch Distinguished University Professor in the Department of History at Cornell University. Previous to that he served as the Marie Underhill Noll Professor of History and a Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellow at Cornell.

LaFeber was one of the United States&#x27; most distinguished scholars of the history of U.S. foreign policy, and a leading member of the &quot;Wisconsin School&quot; of American diplomatic history. He was known for providing widely read revisionist histories of the Cold War with views like William Appleman Williams but more subtle; the label &quot;moderate revisionist&quot; has been applied to him.

LaFeber&#x27;s teaching abilities led to his longstanding undergraduate &quot;History of American Foreign Relations&quot; class at Cornell gaining a reputation as one of the university&#x27;s best and most popular courses. A number of his students went on to prominent positions in the U.S. government and academia. In 2006 LaFeber gave a farewell lecture before nearly 3,000 colleagues and former students at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.

==Early life and education==
LaFeber was born in Walkerton, Indiana, a town of around 2,000 people in the northern part of the state, outside South Bend, on August 30, 1933. His father, Ralph Nichols LaFeber, owned a local grocery store; his mother, Helen (Liedecker), was a housewife. LaFeber worked at his father&#x27;s store from age eight through the end of college. He became a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs.

At Walkerton High School, the LaFeber was a star basketball player. In one game during his senior year for the Indians, he scored 35 points, approaching the single-game record for most points scored in the South Bend sectional of the Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournament. He graduated high school in 1951.

LaFeber attended Hanover College, a small Presbyterian liberal arts college in the southern part of Indiana. LaFeber played varsity basketball for the Hanover Panthers, as a reserve forward during his sophomore year. He also played some during his junior year. He sang in the Hanover College Choir, which provided voices for Sunday morning Presbyterian services and also gave concerts around the state, was co-chair of a &quot;Religion in Life&quot; Week program at the college, and was on the Hanover Board of Student Affairs, which directed extracurricular affairs on campus. He belonged to the Beta Theta Pi social fraternity, the Alpha Phi Gamma national honor society for journalism, and Hanover&#x27;s own Gamma Sigma Pi honor society for academic performance. He received his BA from there in 1955.

LaFeber met Sandra Gould while at Hanover. They married in 1955 and the couple had two children. 

He then went to Stanford University, gaining an MA in 1956.
There, he studied under Thomas A. Bailey, and would be influenced by Bailey&#x27;s lively writing style. Contrary to some later accounts, LaFeber has said he got along well with Bailey. At the time LaFeber was not dissatisfied with U.S. foreign policy, having supported the presidential candidacies of Robert A. Taft in 1952 and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

At this point LaFeber went to the University of Wisconsin. In doing so he followed the advice of one of his college professors and declined an offer from Harvard University, taking advantage of what he later said was &quot;the best professional advice I have ever received.&quot; 
The study of history at Wisconsin had a heritage going back to the time of Frederick Jackson Turner, and the intellectual atmosphere at the school encouraged people to think differently.
At Wisconsin, LaFeber, and several future colleagues and co-authors, initially studied with Fred Harvey Harrington. In an era when the realistic theory of international relations predominated, LaFeber was influenced by Harrington&#x27;s inductive methodology in seminar teaching, sense of irony, and suggestions that the economic interpretations of Charles A. Beard, whose work by then had largely fallen out of favor, should perhaps not be so overlooked. After Harrington moved into university administration, he replaced himself with William Appleman Williams, for whom LaFeber and fellow students Lloyd C. Gardner and Thomas J. McCormick became teaching assistants and with whom they would strike up a close bond (the four of them would become the core of what became known as the Wisconsin School of diplomatic history).

LaFeber was also influenced at Wisconsin by Philip D. Curtin, who developed LaFeber&#x27;s interest in the British Empire, as well as by the early American scholar Merrill Jensen and the intellectual historian Merle Curti. During his dissertation research at the Library of Congress, LaFeber found himself at the same table as historian Ernest R. May of Harvard, with both working on the same period but with very different interpretations of it. The more established May helpfully supplied LaFeber with documents he had found, which LaFeber took as an object lesson on how two fair-minded scholars can reach differing conclusions from the same sources. With his dissertation titled &quot;The Latin American Policy of the Second Cleveland Administration&quot; being accepted, LaFeber received his PhD from Wisconsin in 1959.

==Scholarship==
Cornell University hired LaFeber as an assistant professor in 1959.
He became an associate professor in 1963. LaFeber found an engaging environment with a number of other up-and-coming figures in the history and government departments, including Allan Bloom, Theodore J. Lowi, and Joel H. Silbey among others.

LaFeber&#x27;s &quot;The New Empire: An Interpretation of American Expansion, 1860–1898&quot;, published in 1963, was a greatly expanded revision of his dissertation. It received the Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association; in fact the award was given based on the book having been read in manuscript form before publication. The work established LaFeber as a prominent scholar, and has remained a popular choice in academic circles for several decades.

Historian Irwin Unger, writing in 1967, did not find much to like of Williams or the Wisconsin School overall, but did praise LaFeber as the best of them, a &quot;sophisticated and urbane historian&quot; who was &quot;not a crude polemicist&quot;. Unger found it particularly notable that LaFeber did not vilify the people he identified as being behind much of American foreign policy. Indeed, in the preface to &quot;The New Empire&quot;, LaFeber writes:

Finally, I must add that I have been profoundly impressed with the statesmen of these decades. ... I found both the policy makers and the businessmen of this era to be responsible, conscientious men who accepted the economic and social realities of their day, understood domestic and foreign problems, debated issues vigorously, and especially were unafraid to strike out on new and uncharted paths in order to create what they sincerely hoped would be a better nation and a better world. All this, however, is not to deny that the decisions of these men resulted in many unfortunate consequences for their twentieth-century descendants.
LaFeber&#x27;s publication did meet with some criticism. One later accounting of the Wisconsin School notes that in &quot;The New Empire&quot;, &quot;LaFeber&#x27;s arguments were sometimes questionable or overdrawn, and he acknowledged that he had passed by episodes that did not fit his pattern.&quot;

LaFeber&#x27;s next work, &quot;America, Russia and the Cold War, 1945-1966&quot; (1967), would end up going through ten editions (the last, &quot;America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945-2006&quot;, in 2006), a rarity for a book that is not explicitly a textbook. The book emerged after the initial wave of Cold War revisionist theories had already been published and debated. Eliot Fremont-Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as part of a succeeding wave of books that tried to refine those insights in a firmer historical grounding. Fremont-Smith praised LaFeber&#x27;s work for being a &quot;penetrating account&quot; that was especially strong in sorting out the chronology of events and tracing the impact of domestic politics in each of the countries involved.

The relationship between the scholarship of LaFeber and William Appleman Williams has been characterized by one later historiographic survey this way:
&quot;Williams&#x27; best-known student, who has surpassed the master in the quantity and quality of his historical output while continuing to promote the line of interpretation laid down by Williams, is Walter LaFeber.&quot; 
However, not all have agreed; a broadside against Cold War revisionists was published by historian Robert H. Ferrell in 2006, who criticized their reliance on a monocausal theory. In particular he charged LaFeber with overusing the papers of Bernard Baruch, whom Ferrell said lacked real influence in determining American foreign policy.

LaFeber&#x27;s later scholarly works received praise within academic and other circles. His 1978 work, &quot;The Panama Canal: The Crisis in Historical Perspective&quot;, has been attributed with influence over elite opinion regarding the history of Panama–United States relations and with helping the United States Senate decide to ratify the Panama Canal Treaty. A revised edition in 1990 was critical of U.S. policy since then. In the wake of the United States invasion of Panama in 1989, LaFeber appeared on television frequently as an expert, and in an interview at the time, said the invasion was &quot;an admission of failure to work out a diplomatic solution to get rid of a third-rate dictator that we had created.&quot; &quot;Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America&quot; (1984, revised 1992) received the Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award; in it, LaFeber formulates a variant of dependency theory, called neo-dependency theory, that examines corporate interests as part of explaining the relationships between the countries involved, but still looks at the role of U.S. government policy and other factors as well.

&quot;The American Age: United States Foreign Policy at Home and Abroad Since 1750&quot; (1989, revised 1994) encompasses some of what was in LaFeber&#x27;s famous course. In &quot;The Clash: U.S.-Japanese Relations Throughout History&quot; (1997), LaFeber turned toward East Asia, surveying the breadth of the American engagement and conflict with Japan from the nineteenth century through the 1990s. While a &quot;New York Times&quot; review called it a &quot;dense chronological account...not for the fainthearted,&quot; &quot;The Clash&quot; received both the prestigious Bancroft Prize in American History and the Ellis W. Hawley Prize of the Organization of American Historians.
LaFeber then shifted focus and returned to his youthful interest in basketball, examining the effect of modern sports and communication empires in his book, &quot;Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism&quot; (1999, revised 2002), which analyzes the rise in popularity of basketball, Michael Jordan, Nike, and cable satellite networks and their relation to, and metaphor for, globalization.

Overall, LaFeber&#x27;s career has been characterized as having &quot;imbibed the Wisconsin lessons of empiricism, criticism, and a suspicion of power.&quot;

==Teaching==
LaFeber became the first recipient of the Clark Distinguished Teaching Award at Cornell in 1966; the award was created to honor junior faculty members who were involved in the teaching of undergraduates.

He attained the rank of full professor in 1967, then was named to the Marie Underhill Noll Professor of History chair in 1968. By 1969, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was characterizing LaFeber as &quot;one of most respected members of the faculty&quot; at Cornell.

LaFeber&#x27;s undergraduate History of American Foreign Relations class achieved a reputation as one of the toughest and most popular courses on campus. This was especially so during the turbulent times of the Vietnam War, when students were seeking answers for why their country was involved in that conflict and in other foreign interventions. LaFeber&#x27;s lectures were considered &quot;events&quot;; classes met Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with the last of these being in front of even more people than the weekday ones, because students brought their friends to listen.
Even students who never took the course or went to a lecture were aware of its existence and renown.

LaFeber, who was known for being &quot;old school&quot; in his appearance and demeanor, always wearing a coat and tie to class, was lauded by Cornell&#x27;s in-house newspaper for his simplistic approach to presentation, with a style that has been characterized as &quot;anti-razzle-dazzle&quot;. He began classes by writing an outline of only a few points on the chalkboard and then talking without notes (lecturing from memory was a technique his mentor Harrington had used). At its peak, the course attracted more than 400 students and lectures were sometimes held in the large Bailey Hall to accommodate them. He spoke softly for whatever room he was in, so as to force students to be absolutely quiet in order to hear him. While other revisionists focused more on ideological or institutional forces, LaFeber made his scholarship and his lectures memorable by stressing the role of individuals, from his narrative hero John Quincy Adams to a few Cornell-related figures such as Willard Straight. Throughout his career LaFeber was concerned with teaching students critical thinking skills in historical analysis rather than gaining converts to his viewpoint, and accordingly even those who did not always agree with the markets-oriented interpretations advanced in his lectures still found them compelling. LaFeber&#x27;s classes typically ended to pronounced ovations.

In 2013, the American Historical Association would write of this course that, despite his publishing achievements, &quot;LaFeber might be even more distinguished as a teacher: one for whom the overworked adjective &#x27;legendary&#x27; is entirely fitting. Without eyewitnesses, would we trust accounts that his upper-division lecture course regularly drew 300-plus students each Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday? ... Or that he continued running discussion sections and grading papers for that huge class when he could have easily avoided it?&quot;

In May 1976, during the year of the United States Bicentennial, Cornell University broke with an over-100-year-old tradition: Instead of the university president or another administrator delivering the commencement address, LaFeber became the first faculty member to give it. Cornell president Dale R. Corson later explained the reason: &quot;It was the bicentennial. I felt that something significant should be said by someone who could say it with authority.&quot; In his address at Schoellkopf Field, LaFeber highlighted the similarities of Cornell founders Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to the founders of the nation, saying they shared a common passion in the belief of the power of ideas, but stressed that Cornell and White were part of the expanding of human rights to groups the founders had excluded, thus leading the university to take on the role of &quot;midwife when revolutionary ideas enter an un-revolutionary society.&quot;

LaFeber switched to half-time teaching in 1989, giving classes in the fall but reserving the spring for researching and writing. He began doing less than that in the 1990s, but then was offered the Andrew H. and James S. Tisch Distinguished University Professor post, which brought him back to teaching. The Tisch position is considered Cornell&#x27;s highest faculty distinction.

In another prominent occasion, Cornell president Hunter Rawlings chose LaFeber to give a commemoration address on the Arts Quadrangle following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

His colleague at Cornell, professor and administrator Glenn Altschuler, praised LaFeber&#x27;s overall contribution to the university, saying &quot;He is Midwestern &quot;mensch&quot; - the best thing that&#x27;s happened to Cornell in the last half century.&quot;
Another colleague, Mary Beth Norton, has said that &quot;No other member of the department has commanded the same respect as Walt in the 35 years I have known him.&quot;

The devotion of past students towards LaFeber and his course has often been noted; many, regardless of what occupation they went into, have used the word &quot;awe&quot; to describe their recollection of his lectures. Historian and former student Richard H. Immerman has been quoted as saying, &quot;Those of us who took that course enjoyed a learning experience that we can probably never adequately describe or praise. In a number of specific instances, like my own, it changed lives.&quot; Other future academics have said much the same, including Andrew J. Rotter, and a number of female students inspired by LaFeber later attained success, including Nancy F. Cott, Susan A. Brewer, Lorena Oropeza, and others.

Prominent former students of LaFeber in areas outside academia have included:
U.S. Representative Thomas Downey,
U.S. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley,
and Undersecretary of Defense and U.S. Ambassador Eric S. Edelman;
media critic Eric Alterman,
businessman Andrew Tisch,
Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried,
Ambassador and Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield,
and U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger;
Ambassador Dwight L. Bush Sr.
and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Derek Chollet;
and Jeffrey P. Bialos, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Industrial Affairs.

LaFeber&#x27;s influential students were found working for both parties in Washington and had a diversity of viewpoints. Especially noticeable in this regard were Hadley and other members of &quot;The Vulcans&quot;, an informal name for George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy advisory team, who gained their passion for foreign affairs from LaFeber. Indeed, LaFeber has said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t try to instill anything in anybody. I&#x27;ve never cared about having disciples. [Another professor] did, but he was very convinced he was right. I&#x27;m often not.&quot; To LaFeber, the most important thing was not necessarily the conclusions one drew from history, but the importance of studying it. Alterman has said, &quot;To me, Walter represents the ur-notion of what it means to be a disinterested scholar. There&#x27;s a willingness to follow the scholarship wherever it leads, even if it&#x27;s in politically inconvenient directions.&quot; Nonetheless, LaFeber has sometimes stated his views quite publicly, especially his prediction that the 2003 invasion of Iraq would end up poorly, saying that the Bush Administration&#x27;s foreign policy belief that an invasion would help democracy spread throughout the Middle East &quot;flies in the face of everything we know about Iraqi history.&quot;

==Academic positions and honors==
By early 1966 LaFeber was publicly critical of U.S. strategy in the Vietnam War, saying that the country&#x27;s policy reflected &quot;the dilemma of American liberalism&quot; with policy objectives that were contradictory and paradoxical. In general, LaFeber was in sympathy with many of the student causes of the 1960s, including opposition to the war, the quest for racial justice, and the desire for a political system that better represented democratic ideals. He later said that &quot;academic freedom means the freedom, indeed means the requirement (otherwise what is tenure for?) to criticize American society when evidence accumulates that society has gone off in the wrong direction.&quot;

But the occupation of Willard Straight Hall by African American students, who eventually became armed, as well as some other physical and verbal threats made against university officials and faculty at the time, greatly dismayed him. Many of the younger and more progressive faculty members on campus supported the actions of the campus Afro-American Society and considered that traditional notions of academic freedom were secondary to larger questions of human rights and that a university&#x27;s greatest responsibility was to eradicate racial and other injustices. But LaFeber was one of only a few liberal professors who strongly disagreed with that stance. To LaFeber, academic freedom was paramount; decades later, he reiterated his view:

... what a university is all about is rational discourse. What these people were doing was essentially raping the major principle of the university. Once you introduce any kind of element of force into the university, you compromise the institution. To me, that is totally unforgivable. ... We have to make a distinction between procedure and politics. What I am talking about is procedure. I&#x27;m a relativist in terms of object and conclusion. I don&#x27;t think I am necessarily right. What I am absolutist about is the procedure you use to get there. Which means the university always has to be open and it cannot be compromised.&quot;
Following the actions on campus, in which the university president, James Alfred Perkins, agreed to some of the students&#x27; demands as they departed the Straight, LaFeber resigned his position as chair of the history department.
On a trip to New York City with a few other professors to meet with university trustees, LaFeber marshalled the arguments against the actions of Perkins. LaFeber publicly announced that he would not return to Cornell if Perkins remained. LaFeber&#x27;s stance was one of the more influential in leading to Perkins&#x27; resignation at the end of the semester.

In 1971, LaFeber was named to the American Historical Association&#x27;s seat on the Department of State Historical Advisory Committee, as part of an effort to give revisionist historians a voice during the selection and production of the important &quot;Foreign Relations of the United States&quot; book series. LaFeber became chair of that committee by 1974, and served on it until 1975.

He was selected as a Guggenheim Fellow in 1989.
He gave titled lectures at many universities, and made a number of appearances on radio and television.
He also served on several scholarly editorial boards, including that of &quot;Political Science Quarterly&quot;.

LaFeber was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. LaFeber served as president in 1999 of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations.

LaFeber&#x27;s career as a scholar, teacher, and public figure was celebrated with a Festschrift-like issue in the journal &quot;Diplomatic History&quot; in 2004. The editor-in-chief of the journal wrote in an introductory note that &quot;Professor LaFeber has been a commanding presence in the field of the history of American foreign relations for more than four decades.&quot;

==Later life==

LaFeber retired in 2006 after 46 years on the Cornell faculty. His farewell lecture on April 25, 2006, billed as &quot;A Special Evening With Cornell&#x27;s Walter LaFeber: A Half-Century of Friends, Foreign Policy, and Great Losers&quot; was given to a nearly 3,000-person, capacity gathering of former students, Cornell alumni, and colleagues at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.
(The event had been moved from the originally scheduled American Museum of Natural History venue due to overwhelming demand for tickets.)
The lecture, which was centered in part around the origins and implications of Wilsonianism,
was in his style delivered without notes and once again met with a standing ovation.
Hunter Rawlings, the president of Cornell, noted that the event evinced an &quot;intellectual passion, a group catharsis of the first order,&quot; not by any manifestation of popular culture or the information age, but by nothing more than &quot;a lecture on diplomatic history&quot;.

In 2013, LaFeber was given an American Historical Association&#x27;s 2013 Award for Scholarly Distinction, a lifetime achievement award for what the association said was for being &quot;one of the scholars who re-invented the study of American foreign relations in the 1960s: not only transforming many specific debates, but lastingly changing our sense of what this field could be. ... An exceptionally visible and valuable public intellectual, Professor LaFeber has managed to reach broad audiences without sacrificing academic rigor.&quot;

The influence of LaFeber was again a topic in 2016 at Zankel Hall in New York City, when he and several prominent students discussed the influence of Cornell on American diplomacy.

LaFeber died on March 9, 2021, at an assisted living facility in Ithaca, New York. He was 87.

Later that month, Cornell created the Walter F. LaFeber Professor seat, based on a gift from Andrew H. Tisch (who had audited LaFeber&#x27;s course as an undergraduate in 1970–71). Thomas B. Pepinsky was named the inaugural holder of the professorship.

<text>Sergio Frusoni (August 10, 1901 – May 29, 1975) was a poet and promoter of the Cape Verdean Creole language.

==Biography==
Sérgio was born in Mindelo on the island of São Vicente, the son of Italian immigrants Giuseppe Frusoni and Erminia Bonucci. At the age of 24, he began to work at the &quot;Western Telegraph Company&quot; and changed later on to &quot;Italcable&quot;. In 1947, he managed the &quot;O Café Sport&quot; in Mindelo, the main city of São Vicente, where he presented poems and anecdotes in Crioulo. After that he went back to work for Italcable. In the 1960s, he conducted the theatre group &quot;Theatro do Castilho&quot; in Mindelo. For a number of years, he was chronicler at the radio &quot;Barlavento&quot;, where he produced the program &quot;Mosaico Mindelense&quot; in Crioulo.

Sérgio wrote many short stories and poems in the Creole of São Vicente (&quot;Criol d&#x27; Soncente&quot;). He died, aged 73, in Lisbon. He is well known in Cape Verde, but almost unknown outside the island.

On June 7, 2005, Capeverdean president Pedro Pires paid homage to Sergio Frusoni and declared him as one of the greatest Crioulo poets.

Corsino Fortes described Frusoni in Paralelo 14 (&quot;Parallel 14&quot;)

==Legacy==
Some of his poems would be a part of the &quot;Tertúlia&quot; collection which featured poems made by other poets. In 2004, it was performed in a play at the 10th Mindelo Theatrical Festival.

<text>Hovet (formerly known as Johanneshovs Isstadion or, in English: Johanneshov Ice Stadium) is an arena located in the Johanneshov district of Stockholm (Stockholm Globe City) which is mainly used for ice hockey, concerts and corporate events. It was opened in 1955 as an outdoor arena, however a roof was added in 1962, and the arena interior has also been a subject to major renovation in 2002. The arena&#x27;s main tenants are ice hockey clubs AIK and Djurgårdens IF. The official capacity is 8,094 spectators for ice hockey events and 8,300 during concerts.

==History==
The arena was officially inaugurated on 4 November 1955 with an ice hockey game between Sweden and Norway, which Sweden won 7–2. The original designer was Swedish architect Paul Hedqvist. A roof was added for the 1963 World Ice Hockey Championships. During the autumn of 2002, every chair was replaced and a restaurant area was added at one of the short ends.

Other than AIK and Djurgårdens IF, Hovet has been the regular home arena in different periods for IK Göta, IFK Stockholm, Stureby SK, Mälarhöjden/Västertorp, Brinkens IF, AC Camelen, and Hammarby IF. Since its inaugural year in 2008, Bajen Fans IF, renamed Hammarby IF after the former club, plays one game annually at Hovet. The 2015 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series finals were played at the Hovet.

In May 2016 Hovet was used as the press centre for the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest, which was taking place next door in Globen. The flat ice rink area was covered making way for the press working area, accredited fan zone, filming and radio studios, and a press conference arena.

==Future==
In early 2016, plans were announced for a demolition of the arena in 2020 or later, and a renovation of Globen to better adapt to ice hockey, and to create wider space for residential buildings. The decision to demolish was made by SGA Fastigheter on 8 November 2017. On 20 June 2022, Stockholm Municipality finally announced that the arena will be demolished, as well as plans to refurbish the Avicii Arena. The ice hockey arena is expected to be demolished in 2025, and in its place an underground ice hockey rink is expected to be built.

<text>August von Pelzeln (10 May 1825, Prague – 2 September 1891 in Oberdöbling) was an Austrian ornithologist. He was a grandson to novelist Karoline Pichler (1769-1843).

He studied at the University of Vienna, later working as an assistant under helminthologist Karl Moriz Diesing (1800-1867) in the &quot;Hof-Naturalien-Cabinet&quot; (from 1851). In 1857 he acquired curatorial duties formerly held by Johann Jakob Heckel (1790-1857), and subsequently became in charge of the bird (1857) and mammal (1869) collections. He worked on the birds collected by Johann Natterer in Brazil (343 species).

He was forced to retire from the museum due to ill health, and died at Oberdöbling near Vienna.

Some birds described by Pelzeln are the orange-breasted thornbird, the spot-winged antbird, the red-legged tinamou, the white-throated tinamou, the short-billed leaftosser, the yellow-margined flatbill and the New Zealand rockwren.

His name is associated with Pelzeln&#x27;s tody-tyrant (&quot;Hemitriccus inornatus&quot;). Gustav Hartlaub (1814-1900) named the Madagascar grebe (&quot;Tachybaptus pelzelnii&quot;) in his honor; Otto Finsch (1839-1917) named the Pohnpei starling (&quot;Aplonis pelzelni&quot;) after Pelzeln.

<doc id="1239525" wikidata="Q2250528" url="?curid=1239525" title="Uniforms and insignia of the Sturmabteilung">
<text>The uniforms and insignia of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) were Nazi Party paramilitary ranks and uniforms used by SA stormtroopers from 1921 until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945. The titles and phrases used by the SA were the basis for paramilitary titles used by several other Nazi paramilitary groups, among them the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Early SS ranks were identical to the SA, since the SS was originally considered a sub-organisation of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;.

==Origins of SA titles (1921–1923)==

The brown shirted stormtroopers of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; gradually come into being within the Nazi Party beginning in 1920. By this time, Adolf Hitler had assumed the title of &quot;Führer&quot; of the Nazi Party, replacing Anton Drexler who had been known as the more democratically elected Party Chairman. Hitler began to fashion the Nazi Party on fascist paramilitary lines and, to that end, the early Nazis of the 1920s would typically wear some sort of paramilitary uniform at party meetings and rallies. The most common of these were World War I uniforms with full medals. Also common were uniforms of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; as well as uniforms of veteran groups such as &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;. Nazi Party members would also mix components from all three types of uniforms with little to no standardisation except a swastika armband worn on the left arm.

By 1921, the Nazi Party had taken its &quot;Sports Detachment&quot;, consisting mostly of bodyguards Hitler used for his own protection, and had formed the Nazi stormtroopers, or the &quot;Storm Detachment&quot;, which was shortened to be known as the SA. It was at this point that the very first SA titles came into being, although there were no established uniforms or insignia except a swastika armband worn on a paramilitary uniform. At the start of the group&#x27;s existence, the SA had four primary titles:
* &quot;Oberster SA-Führer&quot; (Supreme SA-Leader)
* SA-&quot;Oberführer&quot; (SA-Senior Leader)
* SA-&quot;Führer&quot; (SA-Leader)
* SA-&quot;Mann&quot; (SA-Trooper)

In 1923, the SA was disbanded after the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch. The group was re-founded two years later in 1925.

==Early SA rank insignia (1924–1929)==
From 1923 to 1925, the SA did not officially exist since Hitler had been imprisoned for his actions in the Munich Putsch and the Nazi Party banned in Germany. Underground cells of SA men did continue to meet in secret, including one run by an SA leader named Gerhard Roßbach. It was Roßbach who effectively invented the &quot;Nazi brownshirt&quot; uniform since, during Roßbach&#x27;s Austrian exile in 1924, a large store of military surplus brown denim shirts intended for tropical uniforms in East Africa, which were originally bought in 1921, was taken over by the Schill Youth in Germany. The &quot;Schill Sportversand&quot; then became the main supplier for the SA brown shirts.

In 1925, the SA was re-founded as part of the new Nazi Party which Hitler had put together following his release from prison. The reborn SA then received its first formal uniform regulations and also began using the first recognisable system of rank insignia.

Along with a brown shirt uniform, SA members would wear swastika armbands with a kepi cap. Originally, the SA used its pre-1923 rank titles, but this changed in 1926 when local SA units began to be grouped into larger regiment sized formations known as &quot;Standarten&quot;. Each SA regiment was commanded by a senior SA officer called a &quot;Standartenführer&quot;. At the same time, to differentiate from the SA rank and file, senior SA officers began to wear oak leaves on their collars to signify their authority. Under this system, a &quot;Standartenführer&quot; wore one oak leaf, an &quot;Oberführer&quot; two oak leaves, and the Supreme SA Commander wore three. The lower ranks of &quot;SA-Führer&quot; and &quot;SA-Man&quot;n still wore no insignia.

In 1927, the officer rank of &quot;SA-Führer&quot; became known by the title of &quot;Sturmführer&quot; and a higher officer rank known as &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; was created to be held by battalion formation commanders directly subordinate to the &quot;Standartenführer&quot;. In 1928, an expansion of SA enlisted ranks was required in response to the growing rank and file membership of the SA troopers. These new titles and ranks were denoted by an insignia system which consisted of silver pips pinned to a wearer&#x27;s collar. The pip system was adopted from the &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; veteran&#x27;s group which was closely connected to the SA both in dual membership and ideological design.

A further change in 1928 was the creation of the rank of &quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. This rank used the three leaf collar insignia previously reserved for the Supreme SA Commander and the rank was held by the senior most SA commanders in Germany who led division sized formations of several SA-&quot;Standarten&quot;. By this time, the SA had also begun to use unit insignia for its junior members which consisted of a numbered collar patch, showing both battalion and regiment affiliation, worn opposite the badge of rank. This unit insignia patch was worn by those holding the rank of &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; and below; the higher officer ranks wore oak leaf insignia on both collars.

By the end of the 1920s, the SA rank system had solidified into the following titles:
==SA uniforms under Ernst Röhm (1930–1933)==

The next major change in SA uniforms and insignia occurred in 1930 when Ernst Röhm was appointed as Chief of Staff of the SA. Röhm&#x27;s appointment was as the result of Hitler personally assuming command of the SA as the &quot;Oberster SA-Führer&quot;. Hitler would hold this title until the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945 and, after 1930, it was the SA Chief of Staff who was the effective leader of the organisation.

Röhm undertook several changes to the SA uniform and insignia design, the first being to invent several new ranks in order for the SA rank system to mirror that of the professional military. The rank expansion took place gradually between 1930 and 1932, with the final addition being the creation of a rank of &quot;SA-Obergruppenführer&quot;, which Röhm appointed to himself as well as senior SA-generals of the SA command staff. The new ranks used the same collar pip and oak leaf system as before, but with the addition of corded shoulder boards worn on the right shoulder for the officers. Further, the officers wore right shoulder cord of either gold or silver. In contrast, the enlisted men wore piping cords shaped as shoulder straps on the right shoulder.

In 1933, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, Röhm made his title of SA-Chief of Staff into an actual rank. The insignia for Röhm&#x27;s new rank (known as &quot;Stabschef&quot;) consisted of a wreathed star which was designed after that of a Bolivian general, due to Röhm&#x27;s previous military experience as a military adviser in Bolivia.

===&quot;Waffenfarben&quot;===

Prior to 1932, when the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; wore the same uniform as the SA, black uniform colours also indicated membership in the SS; however, SS men wore all-black kepis and neckties, and (from 1929) black breeches and boots.

It was also during the 1930s that the SA began using uniform colours to denote an SA member&#x27;s &quot;Gruppe&quot; (Division) to which the SA member belonged. The unit colour was worn on the front of the kepi cap as well as rank and unit collar patches. The marking system - patches/kepi colour combined with gold or silver buttons/pips - would eventually expand to cover these SA divisions; as of 1937:

* Crimson and Gold: SA Chief of Staff
* Carmine and Silver: SA Supreme Command and &quot;Standarte Feldherrnhalle&quot;
* Crimson and Silver: SA Group Staff
* Dark Maroon and Gold: &quot;Ostland&quot; Group (East Prussia and Free City of Danzig)
* Dark Maroon and Silver: &quot;Westfalen&quot; Group (Westphalia and Lippe)
* Black and Gold: &quot;Niederrhein&quot; Group (northern part of Rhine Province)
* Black and Silver: Berlin-Brandenburg Group (Berlin and western part of Brandenburg)
* Pink and Gold: &quot;Ostmark&quot; Group (Eastern part of Brandenburg)
* Apple Green and Gold: &quot;Pommern&quot; Group
* Apple Green and Silver: &quot;Thüringen&quot; Group
* Dark Brown and Gold: &quot;Westmark&quot; Group (parts of Rhine Province and Saar territory)
* Dark Brown and Silver: &quot;Niedersachsen&quot; Group (eastern part of Province of Hanover and Brunswick)
* Emerald and Gold: &quot;Sachsen&quot; Group
* Emerald and Silver: &quot;Nordmark&quot; Group (greater part of Schleswig-Holstein)
* Yellow Orange and Gold: &quot;Mitte&quot; Group (Province of Saxony and Anhalt)
* Yellow Orange and Silver: &quot;Südwest&quot; Group (Württemberg and greater part of Baden)
* Sulphur Yellow and Gold: &quot;Franken&quot; Group (parts of Northern and Western Bavaria)
* Sulphur Yellow and Silver: &quot;Schlesien&quot; Group
* Light Blue and Gold: &quot;Bayerische&quot; Ostmark Group (parts of Eastern and Northern Bavaria)
* Light Blue and Silver: &quot;Hochland&quot; Group (parts of Southern and Western Bavaria)
* Steel Green and Gold: &quot;Nordsee&quot; Group (Western part of Province of Hanover, Oldenburg, and Bremen)
* Steel Green and Silver: Kurpfalz Group (including parts of Hesse and Baden)
* Navy Blue and Gold: &quot;Hansa&quot; Group (Hamburg, Mecklenburg, southern part of Schleswig-Holstein)
* Navy Blue and Silver: &quot;Hessen&quot; Group (Hesse-Nassau and parts of Hesse)

==Final pattern SA uniforms (1934–1945)==

A slight alteration to the rank and insignia system of the SA occurred in July 1934 after the Night of the Long Knives. Viktor Lutze did away with Röhm&#x27;s special insignia for the rank of &quot;Stabschef&quot; and instead adopted a collar patch in much the same design as that of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, a rank which Heinrich Himmler now held.

==Special uniforms==
Even before the fall of Röhm, the SA had adopted a more formal appearance to its uniforms in an effort to make the group appear as an actual military formation rather than a group of street fighters. To this end, the SA had created a formal &quot;office&quot; type uniform which consisted of a brown coat worn over the basic brown shirt uniform.

Special uniforms also existed for corps of the SA, such as the motorised SA, the SA Alpine troops, and the SA-Marine, considered an auxiliary of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. It was the SA-Marine that expanded its uniforms almost to a level unto themselves, with special nautical insignia which no other unit of the SA displayed.
==Sleeves==
The SA used several sleeve insignias to indicate party affiliation.

The SA Veteran Badge, introduced in February 1934, consisted of a brown cotton base with an inverted triangle and a gold braid of aluminum wire sewn onto it, with two thin red cords spaced approximately one centimetre apart. It was awarded to all SA members with membership numbers below 300,000 who had belonged to the Nazi Party before January 30, 1933, when the Nazi Party came to power, and was worn by soldiers and officers alike, regardless of rank.

However, as early as September 1934, the insignia was changed to a tape-type sash, and several sashes of different widths were worn on both cuffs of the uniform jacket depending on the year of enlistment.

There were also cuff titles bearing the names of specific organizations or units, which were worn by each member of that unit.
The SA had a specialization badge on the left sleeve, similar to the military. These usually had runic insignia. The SA instructor school graduates had their sleeve insignia attached higher up on the arm than the swastika armband on the left sleeve.

<text>Stephen Ira Cohen (born May 24, 1949) is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. representative from since 2007. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes the western three-fourths of Memphis. Cohen is Tennessee&#x27;s first Jewish congressman. Since 2023, Cohen has been the only Democrat in Tennessee&#x27;s congressional delegation.
==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 24, 1949, the son of Genevieve (née Goldsand) and pediatrician Morris David Cohen. He has two older brothers, Michael Corey and Martin D. Cohen. He is a fourth-generation Memphian and a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, Poland and Turkey. One of his grandfathers owned a newsstand. Cohen contracted polio when he was five, and the disease caused him to shift his attention from sports to politics at an early age. When he was 11, John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop in Memphis, and Cohen took a picture of Kennedy sitting on a convertible. Cohen describes Kennedy as his political hero; the picture still hangs in his office.

In 1961, Cohen&#x27;s family moved to Coral Gables, Florida, where his father took a residency in psychiatry at the University of Miami. From 1964 to 1966, the Cohens lived in Pasadena, California, where Dr. Cohen completed a fellowship in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Southern California. Cohen, who had been attending Polytechnic School in Pasadena, returned to Florida in 1966 to graduate from Coral Gables Senior High School before returning to Memphis where his father had established his private psychiatry practice.

Cohen graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. At Vanderbilt, he was a member of the Alpha Gamma chapter of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. In 1973, he graduated from the Memphis State University College of Law (now the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law) with a Juris Doctor. 

== Personal life ==
Cohen is unmarried and lives in a Midtown neighborhood.

==Early career==
From 1978 to 2006, Cohen was the sole practitioner of his own law firm, practicing civil and criminal law.

While serving as a legal advisor for the Memphis Police Department from 1975 to 1978, Cohen rose to political prominence when he was elected vice president of the Tennessee Constitutional Convention of 1977 at age 27. Cohen was then elected to serve as a commissioner on the Shelby County Commission, serving from 1978 to 1980. During his time at the commission, he was instrumental in the creation of The Med, a community-funded regional hospital. In 1980, Cohen served as an interim Shelby County General Sessions Court judge. He has also served as a delegate to the 1980, 1992, and 2004 through 2016 Democratic National Conventions.

===Tennessee Senate===
Cohen was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1982, representing the 30th district, which includes parts of Memphis. He held that position for 24 years.

For 18 years, Cohen strove to repeal the ban on lotteries in the Tennessee State Constitution. His efforts were successful in 2002, and a state lottery program designed to provide college scholarships for Tennessee students was adopted the following year. The lottery program is the best-known accomplishment of Cohen&#x27;s Senate career, having raised over $2 billion for scholarships, afterschool programs, pre-K, technical center grants, and energy-saving capital programs in K-12 schools as of 2012. Cohen also sponsored legislation relating to expansion of community access to healthcare, protection of animal rights, reinstatement of voting rights, graduated driver licenses, and funding for the arts. He sponsored the T-Bo law, the nation&#x27;s first-ever statute providing for damages up to $5,000 in cases of intentional or negligent acts resulting in the death of a companion dog or cat. He has won six awards from the Humane Society as of 2011.

Cohen sponsored and passed legislation providing funding for the construction of the Autozone Park baseball stadium, creating the Holocaust Commission, and providing permanent funding for the arts with Tennesseans for the Arts license plates. He was awarded the Bill of Rights Award from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Bird Dog Award for Ethics from Tennessee Common Cause in 1992.

In 1994, Cohen ran for governor of Tennessee, but finished fifth in the Democratic primary with 4.95% of the vote. The nominee, Phil Bredesen, lost the general election to U.S. Representative Don Sundquist, but succeeded Sundquist in 2003.

In March 2005, Cohen was one of three members of the Tennessee Senate to vote against the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment, which prohibited same-sex marriage statewide and was approved by Tennessee voters via a referendum in November 2006. During debate on the amendment, he offered several amendments to it, all of which failed, including the proposed addition of an &quot;adultery clause&quot;, which said, &quot;Adultery is deemed to be a threat to the institution of marriage and contrary to public policy in Tennessee.&quot; Cohen won the Political Leadership Award from the Human Rights Campaign.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====1996====
Cohen ran for the United States House of Representatives seat for the 9th district in 1996, when 22-year incumbent Harold Ford, Sr. retired. The then 26-year-old Harold Ford, Jr., the incumbent&#x27;s son, was his opponent in the Democratic primary. Reflecting on the race, Cohen said, &quot;I&#x27;d spent 14 years in the [state] Senate, had the experience, and didn&#x27;t like the idea of [the seat] being handed down like an heirloom.&quot;

Cohen lost the primary to Ford by 25 points. Noting that Ford, an African-American, did much better than Cohen in majority black precincts despite his inexperience, Cohen said, &quot;It is impossible for a person who is not African American to get a large vote in the African American community... against a substantial candidate. The fact is, I am white, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what you do.&quot; Later, he admitted that his statement was &quot;impolitic&quot; but also noted that &quot;race is still an important factor in voting.&quot;

Cohen returned to the State Senate after the election. Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Cohen did not have to run for reelection to the Senate until 1998.

====2006====
In 2006, Cohen ran again for the 9th district seat; Ford was not running for reelection. Cohen was the first candidate in the race with significant name recognition outside the Memphis area, but had 14 opponents in the primary. &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot;, Memphis&#x27;s daily newspaper, endorsed Cohen in the race. The crowded primary was largely due to the district&#x27;s demographics. The 9th is a heavily Democratic, black-majority district, and it was considered very likely that whoever won the primary would be the district&#x27;s next representative.

Cohen won the August 3 primary by a 4,000-vote margin, despite being outspent 2 to 1 by the runner-up. In fact, six Democrats raised more money than he did. He carried many of the district&#x27;s predominantly black precincts by healthy margins. He faced Republican Mark White and independent Jake Ford (the younger brother of Harold Ford, Jr.) in the general election in November.

Though the ninth district is heavily Democrat, Jake Ford was seen as a serious contender for the race because of his significant name recognition among Memphis&#x27;s black voters. Ford had skipped the Democratic primary because he felt it was too crowded, but said he would caucus with the Democrats if elected. The Ford family has been a significant force in Memphis&#x27;s black community since the days of E.H. Crump. It seemed that the real race was between Cohen and Ford. White was not a serious factor, and would have faced nearly impossible odds even in a two-way race with Cohen.

Cohen was endorsed by the mayor of Memphis, W. W. Herenton, and the mayor of Shelby County, A.C. Wharton, both of whom are black and members of the Democratic Party. He was also endorsed by many local Democratic activists who had long felt that Harold Ford, Jr. was too moderate.

But many of the city&#x27;s politically influential black pastors refused to support Cohen, and the area Black Ministers Association overwhelmingly voted to endorse Jake Ford. The Ford family itself was split. While Harold Ford, Jr. remained neutral (despite rumors of collusion between the brothers&#x27; campaigns), their cousin Joe Ford, Jr., an entertainment lawyer, strongly endorsed Cohen after finishing third in the primary. Harold Ford, Sr. strongly supported his younger son.

On October 8, 2006, Cohen, Ford, and White participated in a televised debate in Memphis. Issues discussed included Iraq, medical marijuana, education, and the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment. Ford attacked Cohen&#x27;s record in the State Senate, including his opposition to the Marriage Protection Amendment, support for medical marijuana, and his voting attendance record. Cohen responded by standing by his public record, pointing out Ford&#x27;s lack of experience in public office, and indicating that Ford had been to jail and had dropped out of high school.

Cohen won the election by a decisive margin, with 60% of the vote to Ford&#x27;s 22% and White&#x27;s 18%. Sixty percent of Cohen&#x27;s votes were from African-Americans.

====2008====

Despite Cohen&#x27;s strong performance in the black community, many of the city&#x27;s politically active blacks felt chagrined at being represented by him. Besides some sentiment that the 9th should be represented by a black Democrat, his socially liberal views also gave them pause. For example, Cohen&#x27;s support for a hate-crimes bill drew particularly strong opposition from most of the city&#x27;s black ministers because it included a sexual orientation provision. Cohen noted that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, and Harold Ford, Jr. had voted for it in the previous Congress. Still, many of the city&#x27;s black ministers tried to rally behind a consensus black candidate to challenge Cohen in the Democratic primary.

Cohen faced four challengers in the August 7 primary. His major opponent was Nikki Tinker, a lawyer who had finished second to Cohen in the 2006 primary and a former aide to Harold Ford, Jr. Tinker received the endorsement of the city&#x27;s Black Ministerial Association.

At a June 2008 campaign event, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Cohen &quot;the conscience of the freshman class&quot;, adding, &quot;He is a progressive and an important member of the Transportation Committee, which provides the infrastructure for jobs that will make America more competitive in the global economy.&quot;

The campaign quickly turned ugly, with Tinker putting together a raft of negative ads. One attacked Cohen for voting against a proposal that would have removed a statue and the remains of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate lieutenant-general who was involved in the founding of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Medical Center park. The ad falsely implied that Cohen had ties to the Klan by juxtaposing him with a white-clad Klansman. Another ad accused Cohen of &quot;praying in our churches&quot; while voting against school prayer during his tenure in the State Senate. Tinker&#x27;s campaign later removed the ads from its YouTube account amid criticism from a number of sources.

On the day the primary was held, Barack Obama denounced Tinker&#x27;s ads, saying they &quot;have no place in our politics, and will do nothing to help the good people of Tennessee.&quot; Harold Ford, Jr. also denounced the ads.

The primary had been marred by antisemitic rhetoric for months before the August vote. In February 2008, Rev. George Brooks, a Tinker supporter, distributed literature in the district that stated that &quot;Cohen and the Jews HATE Jesus&quot; and urged the defeat of an &quot;opponent of Christ and Christianity.&quot; Another minister, Robert Poindexter of Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, said he was supporting Tinker because Cohen was &quot;not black, and he can&#x27;t represent me. That&#x27;s just the bottom line.&quot;

Cohen won the primary with 79% of the vote to Tinker&#x27;s 19%. In his victory speech, he said his victory proved &quot;Memphis has come a long, long way&quot; from its racially divisive past. The win virtually assured him of a second term; no Republican even filed, and any Republican challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds. Cohen was reelected with 87.9% of the vote against three independent challengers, including Jake Ford (who won 4.8%).

Cohen endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary on February 4, 2008, the day before the Super Tuesday primaries. On September 10, 2008, while speaking on the House floor, Cohen compared Obama&#x27;s work as a community organizer to Jesus&#x27; work.

====2010====
Former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton challenged Cohen in the 2010 Democratic primary. In a guest column in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Herenton wrote that while he hoped the campaign would focus on issues rather than race or religion, &quot;it remains a fact that the 9th congressional district provides the only real opportunity to elect a qualified African-American to the all-white 11-member delegation representing Tennessee in Washington.&quot; Herenton also denied having supported Cohen in his 2006 bid against Jake Ford, writing, &quot;I did not support Steve Cohen the individual for the 9th congressional district. I supported an idea that was bigger than him as an individual. I supported the principle of fairness.&quot; During the 2006 campaign, Herenton endorsed Cohen, saying, &quot;Steve Cohen is the best-qualified candidate for this leadership role&quot;. While Cohen&#x27;s commanding win in the 2008 primary suggested that he had strong support among the district&#x27;s African-American community, Herenton was easily his highest-profile opponent to date.

In September 2009, Herenton drew controversy when he said in a radio interview that Cohen &quot;really does not think very much of African-Americans&quot; and that &quot;[Cohen]&#x27;s played the black community well.&quot; In addition, Herenton&#x27;s campaign manager Sidney Chism told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Cohen&#x27;s Memphis-area seat &quot;was set aside for people who look like me. It wasn&#x27;t set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation.&quot; The National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) criticized Herenton for these remarks, calling them &quot;unacceptable in a Democratic primary or anywhere in our political discourse.&quot;

Obama endorsed Cohen for reelection, saying, &quot;Congressman Cohen is a proven leader in the United States Congress and a strong voice for Tennessee. Together, we passed historic health care reform and together we&#x27;re continuing the fight to renew our economy and bring jobs back to the American people. I am proud to stand with Steve and support his reelection to Congress.&quot;

In the unofficial election results, Cohen won 79% of the vote to Herenton&#x27;s 21%. It was the first time Herenton, elected to a record five terms as mayor, lost a race for public office. This all but assured Cohen a third term. In the general election, Cohen defeated Republican challenger Charlotte Bergmann, taking 74% of the vote to Bergmann&#x27;s 25%.

====2012====
Cohen was challenged in the Democratic Primary by Tomeka Hart, an African-American member of the Memphis School Board and Memphis Urban League President who was undefeated in elections up to that point. Cohen won the primary with 89.2% of the vote on August 2, 2012—the highest vote total in the district in recent history and the highest percentage vote for a white candidate running for office in a majority African-American district in history.

Obama endorsed Cohen on April 5, 2012, saying, &quot;Congressman Steve Cohen has worked with me on jobs bills, health care, and other issues of importance to the middle class. He also never fails to pitch me on the city of Memphis, whether it&#x27;s Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis basketball, or barbecue. I urge you to vote for Steve Cohen, a tireless advocate for the 9th district&quot;. In the general election, Cohen defeated Republican businessman George Flinn, winning 75% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Cohen is easily the most progressive member of the Tennessee delegation, and arguably one of the most progressive congressmen ever to represent the state. He has a lifetime rating of 4.3 from the American Conservative Union; for most of his tenure he has had the lowest ACU rating of any lawmaker from Tennessee.

He is the first Jew to represent Tennessee in Congress, the first white Democrat to represent a significant portion of Memphis since freshman George W. Grider was defeated by Republican Dan Kuykendall in 1966, the first Jew to represent a majority black district, and one of the few white congressmen to have represented a black-majority district. Before being elected, Cohen told reporters that he would seek to become the first white member of the Congressional Black Caucus, but later decided against joining after members of the CBC (influenced by co-founder Bill Clay) indicated that they would not allow a non-black to join.

====Book curriculum====

In January 2022, when the board of trustees of McMinn County Schools in Tennessee, in a 10-0 decision, removed the Pulitzer Prize-winning Holocaust graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot; from its curriculum for 8th grade English classes, overriding a state curriculum decision, Cohen was critical of the decision and said he hoped to see it reversed.

====Budget====
Cohen voted against prioritizing spending in the event the debt limit was reached. He voted to create an $825 billion economic recovery package as well as an additional $192 billion anti-recession stimulus in 2009. He supported additional stimulus packages and bailouts, such as the GM and Chrysler bailout.

Cohen supports raising Senate salaries. He also supports extending unemployment benefits from 39 weeks to 59 weeks. He opposes any move to privatize Social Security.

====Gun control====
Cohen supports a ban on private gun sales without a background check and on &quot;fire sales&quot; of firearms, but supports the right to bear concealed firearms. He supports educating children on gun safety through a school program. Cohen was also one of 80 House members to sign a letter to Obama urging him to ban the importation of military-style semiautomatic firearms.

====Energy====
To expand funds available for research and development of alternative energy sources, Cohen supports an excess profits tax on oil companies. He supports investments in solar, wind, and hybrid cars. He supports offering tax credits and incentives to companies that adopt renewable and clean energy methods. He supports the regulation of oil and gas prices and seeks to criminalize oil cartels like OPEC. He opposes offshore drilling and seeks to revoke tax incentives for exploration of oil and gas.

====Environment====
Cohen is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He supports environmental conservation. He opposed a resolution that would bar the EPA from regulating emissions, and opposes allowing offshore drilling. He also supports the expansion of public transportation and train lines.

Cohen has said there are several more animal species that should be classified as endangered and thus receive protection. He believes outdoor classroom experiences should be expanded through massive federal funding.

====Healthcare====
Cohen believes adequate healthcare is a basic right and has opposed any cuts to healthcare funding. He has voted several times to extend healthcare coverage through federal funding.

On May 10, 2012, at a House subcommittee hearing on asbestos trust transparency legislation, Cohen described plaintiff&#x27;s attorneys who contacted him about the illness of his friend Warren Zevon as &quot;parasites.&quot; He said that Zevon—who died from asbestos-related cancer—did not seek a lawyer and did not want damages. In spite of Cohen&#x27;s feelings, he spoke against the bill.

====Cannabis====
Cohen has supported a number of efforts to legalize cannabis in Congress. He cosponsored the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act when it was first introduced in 2011 and every year that it has subsequently been introduced. Other legislation he has cosponsored includes the Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, Marijuana Justice Act, Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, and the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act. Cohen has also introduced the CARERS Act in multiple years (2015, 2017, and 2019) to legalize the medical use of cannabis. He was the headline speaker at Marijuana Policy Project&#x27;s annual gala in January 2010.

====Government reform====
Cohen supports limiting campaign donations and disclosure of amounts coming from lobbyists.

During his first month in Congress, Cohen supported the &quot;100-Hour Plan&quot; in the House, which included raising the federal minimum wage, requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate lower Medicare prescription drug prices, and reducing interest rates for student borrowers. He also cosponsored House Concurrent Resolution 23, which &quot;[expresses] the sense of Congress that the President should not order an escalation in the total number of members of the United States Armed Forces serving in Iraq.&quot;

On February 27, 2007, Cohen introduced a resolution in the House that apologizes for African-American slavery and the system of Jim Crow laws that persisted for 100 years after the abolition of slavery. He noted that no president has officially apologized for allowing slavery. The bill had 36 cosponsors. The resolution passed on July 29, 2008, marking the first time a branch of the federal government had officially apologized for the institution of slavery and its aftermath. Cohen was honored with the D. Emelio Castelar Work Recognition Award by the Vida Foundation in Madrid, Spain for his work on the slavery apology bill and served as the keynote speaker for their international symposium on the abolition of slavery and the slave trade.

Cohen supported the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act (H.R. 2919; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) to prepare a report each year on the amount of fees and other expenses awarded by federal courts to nonfederal entities when they prevail in a case against the United States. An original co-sponsor of the bill, he argued that &quot;Americans have a right to know what their government is doing and their government has a duty to be as transparent as possible.&quot;

Cohen is one of the 19 members of the House Committee on the Judiciary who voted against H.J. Res. 11 118th Congress which would have allowed a floor vote on term limits for Congress. Recent surveys by termlimits.com show 83% of Americans favor term limits for Congress.

====Civil rights====
Cohen received the American Bar Association&#x27;s Day Award along with Representative John Lewis, Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator Richard Lugar. The ABA recognized him for his efforts to improve access to the justice system by providing more funding for the Legal Services Corporation, which provides legal counsel for low income individuals and families. Cohen dedicated the award to Dr. Benjamin Hooks and Dr. Dorothy Height during his acceptance speech.

Cohen sponsored the SPEECH Act banning the practice of libel tourism, rendering libel lawsuits unenforceable if the judgments were issued in a nation where the legal standard for libel is set lower than our own. The Senate Sponsor was Senator Patrick Leahy. The bill passed both houses of Congress in July 2010 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama the following month.

====Abortion====
Cohen supports legal abortion. He opposes the repeal of federally funded abortions and supports a focus on preventing pregnancies with the availability of emergency contraceptives if needed.

====Iraq War====
In 2006, he opposed Republican policy regarding the War in Iraq.

Cohen made a trip to Iraq from October 4 to 7, 2007, as part of a congressional fact-finding delegation. He said that his impression was that Iraq was &quot;not in very good shape&quot; and that its economy has been &quot;ravaged.&quot; Cohen met with soldiers who complained that long deployments are causing divorces. When he raised this concern with General David Petraeus, Petraeus told him that the claims were being exaggerated. After meeting with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Cohen described him as &quot;overly optimistic&quot;, noting his &quot;bizarre&quot; statement that sectarian war in Iraq was over.

====Afghanistan infrastructure====
In 2012, Cohen sponsored the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund has been plagued with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When another member of the House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied, &quot;The truth of the matter is that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going into the pockets of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it&#x27;s good enough to bring them home permanently.&quot; The amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.

====National Guard &amp; Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act====
Cohen sponsored and co-authored, along with J. Randy Forbes, Dana Rohrabacher, Jan Schakowsky, and Jerrold Nadler, The National Guard &amp; Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act, which allows qualifying members of the National Guard and reservists to bypass the often onerous means testing required under current bankruptcy law if their financial hardships were caused by deployment. President Obama signed the bill into law in December 2011.

====Judicial recommendations====
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi assigned Cohen to serve on the House Judiciary Committee, which was his first choice for a committee assignment, as well as the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

As there are no Democratic U.S. Senators from Tennessee, President Obama asked Cohen to recommend judicial nominees. Cohen recommended Bernice Donald for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals alongside John Fowlkes and Sheryl H. Lipman for District Court Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. All three have been confirmed by the United States Senate.

====TVA recommendations====
Cohen recommended Bishop William Graves, V. Lynn Evans, and Ron Walter for the Board of Directors at the Tennessee Valley Authority. All three were nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate. They are the only African-Americans on the TVA Board. Evans and Walter, both from Shelby County, represent the only time two residents of Shelby County have been on the TVA Board simultaneously.

====U.S. Attorney====
Cohen recommended Ed Stanton III to President Obama as U.S. Attorney for Tennessee&#x27;s Western District. Stanton was confirmed in August 2010.

====Votes====
Cohen has sponsored 16 bills since January 4, 2007, of which 13 died in committee and two were enacted. He has co-sponsored 762 bills during the same period.

====Big River Crossing====
Cohen announced in 2012 that Memphis was to be awarded a $15 million TIGER IV Grant for the Main Street to Main Street Multi-Modal Connector Project. The project added a dedicated sidewalk to the Harahan Bridge connecting Tennessee to Arkansas, allowing people to walk or bicycle over the Mississippi River. The project drew praise from many in the business community, including FedEx founder Fred Smith. Construction of the walkway, which was named the Big River Crossing was completed in 2016.

====Helsinki Commission====
Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi appointed Cohen to the Helsinki Commission in 2011. &quot;Congressman Steve Cohen is a leader in promoting civil rights and opportunity of all Americans, and he brings this same passion to the promotion of human rights and democracy around the world&quot;, she said. &quot;The Helsinki Commission is a focal point for security and cooperation among nations and leaders, and Congressman Cohen&#x27;s voice is sure to strengthen and advance the commission&#x27;s work.&quot;

====Armenian issues====

Although his family has no knowledge of any Turkish heritage, Cohen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s birth certificate states his maternal grandfather was born in Turkey when it was part of the Ottoman Empire. He is a member of the Congressional Caucus on US Turkish Relations and Turkish Americans. He had consistently opposed congressional recognition of the Armenian genocide on pragmatic grounds, believing that recognizing it officially in Congress would damage relations with Turkey.

On August 6, 2008, one day before the Democratic Congressional Primary, a confrontation between California-based documentary filmmaker Peter Musurlian and Cohen erupted. During a press conference at Cohen&#x27;s home, Musurlian was asked to leave by Cohen&#x27;s staff and Cohen himself. Cohen then put both hands on Musurlian&#x27;s arms and forced him out of the home after Musurlian refused to leave.

In October 2017, Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, said, &quot;Reps. Stivers, Cohen, and Sessions—in stripping out language about the Armenian Genocide from a bill about Turkish-Armenian relations—are, effectively, carrying Turkish President Erdogan’s water in Washington, advancing his shameful denial campaign even as he’s doubling down on his government’s anti-American actions and attitudes.&quot;

====2011 Nazi controversy====
In a speech on the House floor on January 18, 2011, Cohen said of the Republican effort to repeal the Obama administration&#x27;s health care reform law:

They say it&#x27;s a government takeover of health care, a big lie just like Goebbels. You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That&#x27;s the same kind of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. You tell a lie over and over again. And we&#x27;ve heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.
According to Cohen&#x27;s hometown paper, the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;, he was &quot;accused of upsetting the newfound atmosphere of civility in the House&quot; following the assassination attempt on Representative Gabby Giffords. Republicans, as well as many in the media and in the Jewish community, expressed outrage and demanded that Democrats condemn Cohen&#x27;s comment. Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that &quot;someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric.&quot; His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that &quot;invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable—on either side of the aisle. Cohen&#x27;s comments and similar comments made by others are not helpful as our leaders and citizens conduct a joint effort to advance civility in our political discourse. We implore Cohen and all our leaders to choose their words carefully as we move forward.&quot;

In response to the controversy, Cohen said, &quot;I said Goebbels lied about the Jews, and that led to the Holocaust. Not in any way whatsoever was I comparing Republicans to Nazis. I was saying lies are wrong.&quot;

Cohen later expressed regret for his remarks:

I would certainly never do anything to diminish the horror of the Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people. I sponsored legislation which created one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America and actively served as a Commission member for over 20 years. I regret that anyone in the Jewish Community, my Republican colleagues or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which it has been delivered.

====Boycott of Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s speech to Congress====
In March 2015, Cohen boycotted the speech of the Prime Minister of Israel to Congress, writing: &quot;While Americans and members of Congress may disagree on anything, even foreign policy, providing a forum of such immense prestige and power to the leader of another country who is opposing our nation&#x27;s foreign policy is . It endangers the negotiations, insults the good faith of the other nations involved in the negotiations and emboldens Iran who may well view this schism in our government as an opportunity for advantage. While we can disagree with our President, we as a nation should be as one on our foreign policy and any disagreements should be presented in a respectful, appropriate and time-honored manner.&quot;

In response, Israeli journalist Caroline Glick wrote in an opinion column in the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;: &quot;Radical leftist representatives who happen to be Jewish, like Jan Schakowsky of suburban Chicago and Steve Cohen of Memphis, are joining Netanyahu&#x27;s boycotters in order to give the patina of Jewish legitimacy to an administration whose central foreign policy threatens the viability of the Jewish state.&quot;

====Impeachment matters====
In 2009, Cohen was in the unanimous majority voting to adopt all four articles of impeachment against Judge Samuel B. Kent. All House members participating in the vote voted in favor of each article, with the exception of one member who voted &quot;present&quot; on the fourth article. In 2010, he was also in the unanimous majority that approved all four articles of impeachment against Judge Thomas Porteous. He was also appointed and served as an impeachment manager for Porteous&#x27;s impeachment trial.

On August 17, 2017, Cohen stated plans to bring forward articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump owing to Trump&#x27;s series of comments about a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, five days earlier. Cohen stated on his website:

I believe the President should be impeached and removed from office. Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said &quot;there were very fine people on both sides.&quot; There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen.

On August 15, Trump had commented on the rally, saying that there were &quot;very fine people on both sides&quot; but explicitly excluding &quot;the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally&quot;. No articles of impeachment were introduced at this point.

On October 31, 2019, Cohen voted for the resolution to establish procedures for public hearings in the then-ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. On December 18, 2019, Cohen voted for both articles of impeachment against Trump in Trump&#x27;s first impeachment.

On June 30, 2020, Cohen and 35 cosponsors introduced a resolution (H.Res.1032) on the House floor calling for the impeachment of Attorney General William Barr for many instances of alleged malfeasance.

On January 13, 2021, Cohen voted for the article of impeachment in the second impeachment of Donald Trump.

====&quot;Holocaust distortion&quot;====
On April 25, 2018, 57 House members, including Cohen, released a condemnation of what they called &quot;Holocaust distortion&quot; in Ukraine and Poland. They criticized Poland&#x27;s new Holocaust law, which would criminalize accusing Poles of complicity in the Holocaust, and Ukraine&#x27;s 2015 memory laws glorifying the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its pro-Nazi leaders, such as Roman Shukhevych.

====Russian meddling====
In July 2018, Cohen said that Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections amounted to &quot;an act of war&quot;, which the U.S. needed to counter with &quot;cyber attacks against the Kremlin&quot;. Speaking to Hill.TV&#x27;s Buck Sexton and Krystal Ball, he argued that Russia &quot;invaded our country&quot; by attacking free elections, and thus should be &quot;crippled&quot; by a retributory cyber attack that would have &quot;made Russian society valueless&quot;.

====Israel====
Cohen voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.

===Media===
Cohen has been interviewed on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; and is a frequent guest on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Up with Chris Hayes&quot; and Current TV&#x27;s &quot;The Young Turks&quot;. He has also appeared on &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;, on which Ventura confronted him for co-sponsoring H.R. 645, which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers, otherwise known as Federal Emergency Management Agency camp facilities, on military installations.

Cohen became the subject of media attention when during the 2013 State of the Union address he accidentally publicly tweeted at model Victoria Brink, &quot;pleased u r watching. ilu&quot;, and then deleted the tweet. He later explained to reporters that Brink was his daughter and that he had only learned of her three years prior. In July 2013, CNN facilitated a DNA test with Cohen, Brink, and the man who raised her, John Brink. The test revealed that John Brink was in fact Victoria&#x27;s father. Cohen said in a statement, &quot;I was stunned and dismayed.&quot;

During a 2018 open congressional hearing of FBI agent Peter Strzok, Cohen said, &quot;If I could give you a Purple Heart, I would... This has been an attack on you and a way to attack Mr. Mueller and the investigation that is to get at Russian collusion involved in our election.&quot; Veteran groups criticized his comment, as the Purple Heart is given to wounded soldiers. Cohen apologized for his comments, saying &quot;I regret mentioning the Purple Heart medal at yesterday&#x27;s hearing. My intent was to speak metaphorically to make a broader point about attacks against the FBI and Special Counsel Mueller&#x27;s investigation into a Russian attack on our country.&quot;

Cohen became the subject of media attention when he branded Attorney General William Barr &quot;Chicken Barr&quot; after Barr did not appear for a House Judiciary Committee hearing and then decided to eat from a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken during the hearing.

<doc id="1239545" wikidata="Q4160118" url="?curid=1239545" title="Thomas Penfield Jackson">
<text>Thomas Penfield Jackson (January 10, 1937 – June 15, 2013) was an American jurist who served as a U.S. district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia from 1982 to 2004.

==Education and career==

Born in Washington, D.C., Jackson graduated from Dartmouth College with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in the class of 1958, and from Harvard Law School with a Bachelor of Laws in 1964. He served in the United States Navy from 1958 to 1961. He was in private practice in Washington, D.C. from 1964 to 1982. He served as President of the District of Columbia Bar Association.

==Federal judicial service==

Jackson was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on May 24, 1982, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge Oliver Gasch. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 24, 1982, and received commission on June 25, 1982. He assumed senior status on January 31, 2002. His service terminated on August 31, 2004, due to retirement.

===Terry A. Anderson case===
in 2000, as presiding judge, he ruled in favor of Terry A. Anderson and awarded Anderson $324 million from frozen Iranian assets due to Anderson&#x27;s captivity in Lebanon under Shia Hezbollah militants of the Islamic Jihad Organization who are designated by the United States State Department as Iranian government supported terrorists. The basis of Anderson&#x27;s case was from a 1996 anti-terrorism law which allowed United States citizens, who are victims of terrorism abroad, to sue foreign governments for damages.

===Microsoft case===
Jackson is perhaps best known to the public as the presiding judge in the 2001 antitrust &quot;United States v. Microsoft&quot; case. Jackson was the first in a series of judges worldwide to determine that Microsoft abused its market position and monopoly power in ways that were highly detrimental to innovation in the industry and consumers of the products. The summary paragraph in his findings of fact is quoted below.

Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft&#x27;s actions have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the computer industry. Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and others, Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft&#x27;s core products. Microsoft&#x27;s past success in hurting such companies and stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s self-interest.

Microsoft attempted to show that Jackson&#x27;s conduct during the case demonstrated that he unfairly favored the prosecution, but they failed to do so in court proceedings. He did speak to a reporter off the record after the evidence in the case had been heard but prior to issuing his conclusions of law, and this was contrary to judicial rules. Speaking with that reporter he expressed unfavorable opinions and statements about Microsoft and its employees which he had developed as a result of hearing the evidence and witnesses in the trial. Speaking about Microsoft executives, he compared them to &quot;stubborn mules who should be walloped with a two-by-four&quot; and &quot;gangland killers&quot;, referring to a murder case he presided over four years earlier:

On the day of the sentencing, the gang members maintained that they had done nothing wrong, saying that the whole case was a conspiracy by the white power structure to destroy them. I am now under no illusions that miscreants will realize that other parts of society view them that way.&quot;

The judge also characterized Microsoft leader and co-founder Bill Gates as a Napoleon, &quot;unethical&quot;, as well as comparing him to a &quot;drug trafficker&quot; repeatedly caught as a result of telephone wiretaps. However, it was private meetings with journalists released after the verdict but during the appeal that caused the appeal to be granted.

Jackson&#x27;s order that Microsoft be divided into two companies, one owning the Windows operating system and the other owning Microsoft&#x27;s various application software products, including the Internet Explorer web browser, was reversed on appeal. Eight of his factual findings about Microsoft&#x27;s monopolistic practices against the Sherman Antitrust Act were upheld. During the appellate hearing, Harry Edwards, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, stated that judges have no right to &quot;go run off our mouths&quot; about cases they hear. &quot;The system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this.&quot;

Jackson, in spite of the findings of the appellate court, continued to deny that any such bias existed and insisted that any perception of bias in the minds of observers was created by Microsoft. His statements were a response to several evasive tactics Microsoft used at the trial, including falsifying video evidence, non-responsiveness on the stand, and denying allegations contained in evidence.

When an unrelated case involving Microsoft and charges of discrimination was assigned to him in 2001, Jackson recused himself from the case. The recusal has been called into question by some commentators, as other cases have warranted a &quot;slap on the wrist&quot; of the judiciary, such as the Marion Barry trial in 1990 where Jackson said, &quot;that he had never seen a stronger government case and was upset that some jurors would not vote to convict.&quot; The appeals court upheld the verdict, but commented that &quot;It is worth noting that the district court judge could have recused himself in this case. The recusal option was a compelling one.&quot;

==Post judicial service==

Until his death, Jackson was a partner at the law firm of Jackson and Campbell, P.C..

For many years after his retirement from the court, Jackson served on the Board of Trustees for St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland. He was very active on the board and also played key roles in the establishment of the Center for the Study of Democracy at the college, where he also served on the advisory board. Jackson was often on the campus, working with professors and delivering class and seminar lectures free of charge and also mentoring students.

In 2014, St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland established the Thomas Penfield Jackson Award for Civic Responsibility and Democratic Citizenship in his honor. The award will be given yearly to students demonstrating exceptional citizenship and scholarship.

Jackson died of cancer at his home in Compton, Maryland on June 15, 2013.

<text>HMS &quot;Caister Castle&quot; was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Caistor Castle&quot; was laid down by John Lewis &amp; Sons at their shipyard in Aberdeen on 26 August 1943 and launched on 22 May 1944. She was completed on 29 September and served as a convoy escort until the end of the war in May 1945. After the war, &quot;Caistor Castle&quot; was in reserve at Devonport from 1947 until 1948. She represented the Reserve Fleet at the 1953 Coronation Review and served in the Second Training Squadron at Portland from February 1953 until 1955. &quot;Caistor Castle&quot; was then placed in reserve at Devonport before being sold for scrap to Arnott Young in 1956; the ship arrived at Dalmuir in March to be broken up.

<doc id="1239555" wikidata="Q4147546" url="?curid=1239555" title="Civil union in New Zealand">
<text>Civil union has been legal in New Zealand since 26 April 2005. The Civil Union Act 2004 to establish the institution of civil union for same-sex and opposite-sex couples was passed by the Parliament on 9 December 2004.

The act has been described as very similar to the Marriage Act 1955 with references to &quot;marriage&quot; replaced by &quot;civil union&quot;. A companion bill, the Relationships (Statutory References) Act, was passed shortly thereafter on 15 March 2005, to remove discriminatory provisions on the basis of relationship status from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a &quot;de facto&quot; partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to immigration, next-of-kin status, social welfare, matrimonial property and other areas. Non-married couples are not, however, permitted to adopt children, although people in non-marital relationships can adopt as individuals.

==History==
Both the Civil Union Bill and the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill were promoted as part of their Ministerial responsibilities by the Labour MPs and Ministers David Benson-Pope and Lianne Dalziel. The Civil Union Bill was treated as a conscience issue by most parties, including the largest parties on the left and right, and passed its third and final reading by 65 votes to 55.

During consideration of the bill, various amendments were proposed. These included making the issue subject to a binding referendum, (a motion moved by New Zealand First MP Ron Mark who voted for the first two readings of the Bill, but against in its final vote). Another was to replace it with a &quot;civil relationships&quot; bill that would allow any two people to register any personal relationship and to gain joint property rights (moved by National MP Richard Worth, a consistent opponent of the bill). These proposals were dismissed by supporters of the bill as delaying tactics rather than serious proposals and were defeated in Parliament by a block vote of Labour, the Greens, and the Progressives.

The Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was also treated as a conscience vote and passed by 76 votes to 44 votes.

Civil Unions came into effect on Tuesday 26 April 2005 for licence applications and at least two couples had applied for licenses by 9:30 that morning. The first civil union ceremonies were performed on Friday 29 April 2005 (marriage and civil union licences need to be applied for at least three working days before the ceremony).

== Public opinion ==
Before passage, the New Zealand public supported the bill, with one opinion poll indicating around 56% in favour. The bill was controversial in some quarters, attracting strong opposition from the evangelical Destiny Church and the Catholic Church in New Zealand. However, not all Christians in New Zealand were opposed to the bill. Christians for Civil Unions played a role in the debates along with other Christian groups including the World Student Christian Federation.

In the build up to the vote, there were several instances of anti-gay and lesbian protests and rallies as a way of dissuading public favour. The most publicised rally was the &#x27;Enough is Enough&#x27; march through central Wellington, terminating at Parliament, in August 2004. The march was organised by the Brian Tamaki-led Destiny Church and involved thousands of church members and supporters, many wearing black shirts, marching down Lambton Quay punching the air with their fists and chanting &#x27;enough is enough&#x27;. Also present on this march were members of the Christian Heritage Party and white supremacist group National Front. Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s UniQ and other queer groups held a counter-rally in response, and were joined by transgender Member of Parliament Georgina Beyer.

Other protest action saw a theology student cover the windows of David Benson-Pope&#x27;s South Dunedin electoral office with posters denouncing the bill. These bore the message &#x27;Civil Unions Is &quot;(sic)&quot; Not Gay Marriage. Yeah Right&#x27; in a parody of Tui beer advertisements. Three months after the Civil Union Act came into effect, a Herald-DigiPoll survey revealed that a plurality of people who expressed an opinion either way were happy with the legislation. When asked &quot;whether they were happy or unhappy with the way the law allowing civil unions is working,&quot; 46% said they were happy, 35.7% were unhappy, and 18.1% were undecided or refused to comment.

==Numbers==

As at 31 December 2012, 2455 civil unions were registered to New Zealand residents. These comprised 1920 same-sex unions, of which 1131 had been between females and 789 had been between males, and 535 opposite-sex unions. In addition, 474 civil unions were registered to overseas residents. 124 civil unions had been dissolved.

==Forced civil unions==
In 2012, National Party MP Jackie Blue submitted a member&#x27;s bill, the Marriage (Court Consent to Marriage of Minors) Amendment Bill, to address the problem of forced marriages of 16 and 17-year-olds. There are about 80 applications per year for marriages between 16- and 17-year-olds. The bill was picked up by fellow National MP Jo Hayes after Blue left Parliament, and was drawn from the ballot on 13 April 2017.

The bill required 16 and 17-year-olds who wish to marry to apply to the Family Court for the consent of a Family Court Judge, in place of consent from a parent or guardian, and set out how the court is to consider the application. At the Select Committee stage, the bill was broadened to cover civil unions and &quot;de facto&quot; relationships in addition to marriages, and was retitled the Minors (Court Consent to Relationships) Legislation Bill. The bill passed its third reading on 8 August 2018, received Royal Assent on 13 August and came into force the following day.

<doc id="1239556" wikidata="Q702933" url="?curid=1239556" title="Arrow–Debreu model">
<text>In mathematical economics, the Arrow–Debreu model is a theoretical general equilibrium model. It posits that under certain economic assumptions (convex preferences, perfect competition, and demand independence), there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy.

The model is central to the theory of general (economic) equilibrium, and it is used as a general reference for other microeconomic models. It was proposed by Kenneth Arrow, Gérard Debreu in 1954, and Lionel W. McKenzie independently in 1954, with later improvements in 1959.

The A-D model is one of the most general models of competitive economy and is a crucial part of general equilibrium theory, as it can be used to prove the existence of general equilibrium (or Walrasian equilibrium) of an economy. In general, there may be many equilibria.

Arrow (1972) and Debreu (1983) were separately awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their development of the model. McKenzie, however, did not receive the award.
== Formal statement ==
This section follows the presentation in, which is based on.

=== Intuitive description of the Arrow–Debreu model ===
The Arrow–Debreu model models an economy as a combination of three kinds of agents: the households, the producers, and the market. The households and producers transact with the market but not with each other directly.

The households possess endowments (bundles of commodities they begin with), one may think of as &quot;inheritance.&quot; For mathematical clarity, all households must sell all their endowment to the market at the beginning. If they wish to retain some of the endowments, they would have to repurchase them from the market later. The endowments may be working hours, land use, tons of corn, etc.

The households possess proportional ownerships of producers, which can be thought of as joint-stock companies. The profit made by producer formula_1 is divided among the households in proportion to how much stock each household holds for the producer formula_1. Ownership is imposed initially, and the households may not sell, buy, create, or discard them.

The households receive a budget, income from selling endowments, and dividend from producer profits. The households possess preferences over bundles of commodities, which, under the assumptions given, makes them utility maximizers. The households choose the consumption plan with the highest utility they can afford using their budget.

The producers can transform bundles of commodities into other bundles of commodities. The producers have no separate utility functions. Instead, they are all purely profit maximizers.

The market is only capable of &quot;choosing&quot; a market price vector, which is a list of prices for each commodity, which every producer and household takes (there is no bargaining behavior—every producer and household is a price taker). The market has no utility or profit. Instead, the market aims to choose a market price vector such that, even though each household and producer is maximizing their utility and profit, their consumption and production plans &quot;harmonize.&quot; That is, &quot;the market clears&quot;. In other words, the market is playing the role of a &quot;Walrasian auctioneer.&quot;

=== Notation setup ===
In general, we write indices of agents as superscripts and vector coordinate indices as subscripts.

==== useful notations for real vectors ====

* formula_3 if formula_4
* formula_5 is the set of formula_6 such that formula_7
* formula_8 is the set of formula_6 such that formula_10
* formula_11 is the N-simplex. We often call it the price simplex since we sometimes scale the price vector to lie on it.

==== market ====

* The commodities are indexed as formula_12. Here formula_13 is the number of commodities in the economy. It is a finite number.
* The price vector formula_14 is a vector of length formula_13, with each coordinate being the price of a commodity. The prices may be zero or positive.

==== households ====

* The households are indexed as formula_16.
* Each household begins with an endowment of commodities formula_17.
* Each household begins with a tuple of ownerships of the producers formula_18. The ownerships satisfy formula_19.
* The budget that the household receives is the sum of its income from selling endowments at the market price, plus profits from its ownership of producers:formula_20(formula_21 stands for &quot;money&quot;)
* Each household has a Consumption Possibility Set formula_22.
* Each household has a preference relation formula_23 over formula_24.
* With assumptions on formula_23 (given in the next section), each preference relation is representable by a utility function formula_26 by the Debreu theorems. Thus instead of maximizing preference, we can equivalently state that the household is maximizing its utility.
* A consumption plan is a vector in formula_24, written as formula_28.
* formula_29 is the set of consumption plans at least as preferable as formula_28.
* The budget set is the set of consumption plans that it can afford:formula_31.
* For each price vector formula_32, the household has a demand vector for commodities, as formula_33. This function is defined as the solution to a constraint maximization problem. It depends on both the economy and the initial distribution.formula_34It may not be well-defined for all formula_35. However, we will use enough assumptions to be well-defined at equilibrium price vectors.

==== producers ====

* The producers are indexed as formula_36.
* Each producer has a Production Possibility Set formula_37. Note that the supply vector may have both positive and negative coordinates. For example, formula_38 indicates a production plan that uses up 1 unit of commodity 1 to produce 1 unit of commodity 2.
* A production plan is a vector in formula_37, written as formula_40.
* For each price vector formula_32, the producer has a supply vector for commodities, as formula_42. This function will be defined as the solution to a constraint maximization problem. It depends on both the economy and the initial distribution.formula_43It may not be well-defined for all formula_35. However, we will use enough assumptions to be well-defined at equilibrium price vectors.
* The profit is formula_45

==== aggregates ====

* aggregate consumption possibility set formula_46.
* aggregate production possibility set formula_47.
* aggregate endowment formula_48
* aggregate demand formula_49
* aggregate supply formula_50
* excess demand formula_51

==== the whole economy ====

* An economy is a tuple formula_52. It is a tuple specifying the commodities, consumer preferences, consumption possibility sets, and producers&#x27; production possibility sets.
* An economy with initial distribution is an economy, along with an initial distribution tuple formula_53 for the economy.
* A state of the economy is a tuple of price, consumption plans, and production plans for each household and producer: formula_54.
* A state is feasible iff each formula_55, each formula_56, and formula_57.
* The feasible production possibilities set, given endowment formula_58, is formula_59.
* Given an economy with distribution, the state corresponding to a price vector formula_32 is formula_61.
* Given an economy with distribution, a price vector formula_32 is an equilibrium price vector for the economy with initial distribution, iffformula_63That is, if a commodity is not free, then supply exactly equals demand, and if a commodity is free, then supply is equal or greater than demand (we allow free commodity to be oversupplied).
* A state is an equilibrium state iff it is the state corresponding to an equilibrium price vector.

=== Assumptions ===

=== Imposing an artificial restriction ===
The functions formula_64 are not necessarily well-defined for all price vectors formula_32. For example, if producer 1 is capable of transforming formula_66 units of commodity 1 into formula_67 units of commodity 2, and we have formula_68, then the producer can create plans with infinite profit, thus formula_69, and formula_70 is undefined.

Consequently, we define &quot;restricted market&quot; to be the same market, except there is a universal upper bound formula_71, such that every producer is required to use a production plan formula_72. Each household is required to use a consumption plan formula_73. Denote the corresponding quantities on the restricted market with a tilde. So, for example, formula_74 is the excess demand function on the restricted market.

formula_71 is chosen to be &quot;large enough&quot; for the economy so that the restriction is not in effect under equilibrium conditions (see next section). In detail, formula_71 is chosen to be large enough such that:

* For any consumption plan formula_6 such that formula_78, the plan is so &quot;extravagant&quot; that even if all the producers coordinate, they would still fall short of meeting the demand.
* For any list of production plans for the economy formula_79, if formula_80, then formula_81for each formula_36. In other words, for any attainable production plan under the given endowment formula_58, each producer&#x27;s individual production plan must lie strictly within the restriction.

Each requirement is satisfiable.

* Define the set of attainable aggregate production plans to be formula_84, then under the assumptions for the producers given above (especially the &quot;no arbitrarily large free lunch&quot; assumption), formula_85 is bounded for any formula_86 (proof omitted). Thus the first requirement is satisfiable.
* Define the set of attainable individual production plans to be formula_87then under the assumptions for the producers given above (especially the &quot;no arbitrarily large transformations&quot; assumption), formula_88 is bounded for any formula_89 (proof omitted). Thus the second requirement is satisfiable.

The two requirements together imply that the restriction is not a real restriction when the production plans and consumption plans are &quot;interior&quot; to the restriction.

* At any price vector formula_32, if formula_91, then formula_92 exists and is equal to formula_93. In other words, if the production plan of a restricted producer is interior to the artificial restriction, then the unrestricted producer would choose the same production plan. This is proved by exploiting the second requirement on formula_71.
* If all formula_95, then the restricted and unrestricted households have the same budget. Now, if we also have formula_96, then formula_97 exists and is equal to formula_98. In other words, if the consumption plan of a restricted household is interior to the artificial restriction, then the unrestricted household would choose the same consumption plan. This is proved by exploiting the first requirement on formula_71.

These two propositions imply that equilibria for the restricted market are equilibria for the unrestricted market:

=== existence of general equilibrium ===
As the last piece of the construction, we define Walras&#x27;s law:

* The unrestricted market satisfies Walras&#x27;s law at formula_32 iff all formula_101 are defined, and formula_102, that is,formula_103
* The restricted market satisfies Walras&#x27;s law at formula_32 iff formula_105.

Walras&#x27;s law can be interpreted on both sides:

* On the side of the households, it is said that the aggregate household expenditure is equal to aggregate profit and aggregate income from selling endowments. In other words, every household spends its entire budget.
* On the side of the producers, it is saying that the aggregate profit plus the aggregate cost equals the aggregate revenue.


Note that the above proof does not give an iterative algorithm for finding any equilibrium, as there is no guarantee that the function formula_106 is a contraction. This is unsurprising, as there is no guarantee (without further assumptions) that any market equilibrium is a stable equilibrium.

=== The role of convexity ===


In 1954, McKenzie and the pair Arrow and Debreu independently proved the existence of general equilibria by invoking the Kakutani fixed-point theorem on the fixed points of a continuous function from a compact, convex set into itself. In the Arrow–Debreu approach, convexity is essential, because such fixed-point theorems are inapplicable to non-convex sets. For example, the rotation of the unit circle by 90 degrees lacks fixed points, although this rotation is a continuous transformation of a compact set into itself; although compact, the unit circle is non-convex. In contrast, the same rotation applied to the convex hull of the unit circle leaves the point &quot;(0,0)&quot; fixed. Notice that the Kakutani theorem does not assert that there exists exactly one fixed point. Reflecting the unit disk across the y-axis leaves a vertical segment fixed, so that this reflection has an infinite number of fixed points.

===Non-convexity in large economies===
The assumption of convexity precluded many applications, which were discussed in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; from 1959 to 1961 by Francis M. Bator, M. J. Farrell, Tjalling Koopmans, and Thomas J. Rothenberg. proved the existence of economic equilibria when some consumer preferences need not be convex. In his paper, Starr proved that a &quot;convexified&quot; economy has general equilibria that are closely approximated by &quot;quasi-equilbria&quot; of the original economy; Starr&#x27;s proof used the Shapley–Folkman theorem.

=== Uzawa equivalence theorem ===
(Uzawa, 1962) showed that the existence of general equilibrium in an economy characterized by a continuous excess demand function fulfilling Walras&#x27;s Law is equivalent to Brouwer fixed-Point theorem. Thus, the use of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem is essential for showing that the equilibrium exists in general.

=== Fundamental theorems of welfare economics ===
In welfare economics, one possible concern is finding a Pareto-optimal plan for the economy.

Intuitively, one can consider the problem of welfare economics to be the problem faced by a master planner for the whole economy: given starting endowment formula_58 for the entire society, the planner must pick a feasible master plan of production and consumption plans formula_108. The master planner has a wide freedom in choosing the master plan, but any reasonable planner should agree that, if someone&#x27;s utility can be increased, while everyone else&#x27;s is not decreased, then it is a better plan. That is, the Pareto ordering should be followed.

Define the Pareto ordering on the set of all plans formula_108 by formula_110 iff formula_111 for all formula_16.

Then, we say that a plan is Pareto-efficient with respect to a starting endowment formula_58, iff it is feasible, and there does not exist another feasible plan that is strictly better in Pareto ordering.

In general, there are a whole continuum of Pareto-efficient plans for each starting endowment formula_58. 

With the set up, we have two fundamental theorems of welfare economics:

Proof idea: any Pareto-optimal consumption plan is separated by a hyperplane from the set of attainable consumption plans. The slope of the hyperplane would be the equilibrium prices. Verify that under such prices, each producer and household would find the given state optimal. Verify that Walras&#x27;s law holds, and so the expenditures match income plus profit, and so it is possible to provide each household with exactly the necessary budget.
=== convexity vs strict convexity ===
The assumptions of strict convexity can be relaxed to convexity. This modification changes supply and demand functions from point-valued functions into set-valued functions (or &quot;correspondences&quot;), and the application of Brouwer&#x27;s fixed-point theorem into Kakutani&#x27;s fixed-point theorem.

This modification is similar to the generalization of the minimax theorem to the existence of Nash equilibria.

The two fundamental theorems of welfare economics holds without modification.
=== equilibrium vs &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; ===
The definition of market equilibrium assumes that every household performs utility maximization, subject to budget constraints. That is, formula_115The dual problem would be cost minimization subject to utility constraints. That is,formula_116for some real number formula_117. The duality gap between the two problems is nonnegative, and may be positive. Consequently, some authors study the dual problem and the properties of its &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; (or &quot;compensated equilibrium&quot;). Every equilibrium is a quasi-equilibrium, but the converse is not necessarily true.

=== Accounting for strategic bargaining ===
In the model, all producers and households are &quot;price takers&quot;, meaning that they transact with the market using the price vector formula_32. In particular, behaviors such as cartel, monopoly, consumer coalition, etc are not modelled. Edgeworth&#x27;s limit theorem shows that under certain stronger assumptions, the households can do no better than price-take at the limit of an infinitely large economy.

==== Setup ====
In detail, we continue with the economic model on the households and producers, but we consider a different method to design production and distribution of commodities than the market economy. It may be interpreted as a model of a &quot;socialist&quot; economy.

* There is no money, market, or private ownership of producers.
* Since we have abolished private ownership, money, and the profit motive, there is no point in distinguishing one producer from the next. Consequently, instead of each producer planning individually formula_119, it is as if the whole society has one great producer producing formula_120.
* Households still have the same preferences and endowments, but they no longer have budgets.
* Producers do not produce to maximize profit, since there is no profit. All households come together to make a state formula_121—a production and consumption plan for the whole economy—with the following constraints:formula_122
* Any nonempty subset of households may eliminate all other households, while retaining control of the producers.

This economy is thus a cooperative game with each household being a player, and we have the following concepts from cooperative game theory:

* A blocking coalition is a nonempty subset of households, such that there exists a strictly Pareto-better plan even if they eliminate all other households.
* A state is a core state iff there are no blocking coalitions.
* The core of an economy is the set of core states.
Since we assumed that any nonempty subset of households may eliminate all other households, while retaining control of the producers, the only states that can be executed are the core states. A state that is not a core state would immediately be objected by a coalition of households.

We need one more assumption on formula_123, that it is a cone, that is, formula_124 for any formula_125. This assumption rules out two ways for the economy to become trivial.

* The curse of free lunch: In this model, the whole formula_123 is available to any nonempty coalition, even a coalition of one. Consequently, if nobody has any endowment, and yet formula_123 contains some &quot;free lunch&quot; formula_128, then (assuming preferences are monotonic) every household would like to take all of formula_129 for itself, and consequently there exists *no* core state. Intuitively, the picture of the world is a committee of selfish people, vetoing any plan that doesn&#x27;t give the entire free lunch to itself.
* The limit to growth: Consider a society with 2 commodities. One is &quot;labor&quot; and another is &quot;food&quot;. Households have only labor as endowment, but they only consume food. The formula_123 looks like a ramp with a flat top. So, putting in 0-1 thousand hours of labor produces 0-1 thousand kg of food, linearly, but any more labor produces no food. Now suppose each household is endowed with 1 thousand hours of labor. It&#x27;s clear that every household would immediately block every other household, since it&#x27;s always better for one to use the entire formula_123 for itself.

==== Main results (Debreu and Scarf, 1963) ====


In Debreu and Scarf&#x27;s paper, they defined a particular way to approach an infinitely large economy, by &quot;replicating households&quot;. That is, for any positive integer formula_132, define an economy where there are formula_132 households that have exactly the same consumption possibility set and preference as household formula_134.

Let formula_135 stand for the consumption plan of the formula_136-th replicate of household formula_134. Define a plan to be equitable iff formula_138 for any formula_16 and formula_140.

In general, a state would be quite complex, treating each replicate differently. However, core states are significantly simpler: they are equitable, treating every replicate equally.

Consequently, when studying core states, it is sufficient to consider one consumption plan for each type of households. Now, define formula_141 to be the set of all core states for the economy with formula_132 replicates per household. It is clear that formula_143, so we may define the limit set of core states formula_144.

We have seen that formula_71 contains the set of market equilibria for the original economy. The converse is true under minor additional assumption:

The assumption that formula_123 is a polygonal cone, or every formula_24 has nonempty interior, is necessary to avoid the technical issue of &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot;. Without the assumption, we can only prove that formula_71 is contained in the set of quasi-equilibria.

=== Accounting for nonconvexity ===
The assumption that production possibility sets are convex is a strong constraint, as it implies that there is no economy of scale. Similarly, we may consider nonconvex consumption possibility sets and nonconvex preferences. In such cases, the supply and demand functions formula_101 may be discontinuous with respect to price vector, thus a general equilibrium may not exist.

However, we may &quot;convexify&quot; the economy, find an equilibrium for it, then by the Shapley–Folkman–Starr theorem, it is an approximate equilibrium for the original economy.

In detail, given any economy satisfying all the assumptions given, except convexity of formula_150 and formula_23, we define the &quot;convexified economy&quot; to be the same economy, except that

* formula_152
* formula_153
* formula_154 iff formula_155.

where formula_156 denotes the convex hull.

With this, any general equilibrium for the convexified economy is also an approximate equilibrium for the original economy. That is, if formula_157 is an equilibrium price vector for the convexified economy, thenformula_158where formula_159 is the Euclidean distance, and formula_160 is any upper bound on the inner radii of all formula_150 (see page on Shapley–Folkman–Starr theorem for the definition of inner radii).

The convexified economy may not satisfy the assumptions. For example, the set formula_162 is closed, but its convex hull is not closed. Imposing the further assumption that the convexified economy also satisfies the assumptions, we find that the original economy always has an approximate equilibrium.

=== Accounting for time, space, and uncertainty ===

The commodities in the Arrow–Debreu model are entirely abstract. Thus, although it is typically represented as a static market, it can be used to model time, space, and uncertainty by splitting one commodity into several, each contingent on a certain time, place, and state of the world. For example, &quot;apples&quot; can be divided into &quot;apples in New York in September if oranges are available&quot; and &quot;apples in Chicago in June if oranges are not available&quot;.

Given some base commodities, the Arrow–Debreu complete market is a market where there is a separate commodity for every future time, for every place of delivery, for every state of the world under consideration, for every base commodity.

In financial economics the term &quot;Arrow–Debreu&quot; most commonly refers to an Arrow–Debreu security. A canonical Arrow–Debreu security is a security that pays one unit of numeraire if a particular state of the world is reached and zero otherwise (the price of such a security being a so-called &quot;state price&quot;). As such, any derivatives contract whose settlement value is a function on an underlying whose value is uncertain at contract date can be decomposed as linear combination of Arrow–Debreu securities.

Since the work of Breeden and Lizenberger in 1978, a large number of researchers have used options to extract Arrow–Debreu prices for a variety of applications in financial economics.

=== Accounting for the existence of money ===
Typically, economists consider the functions of money to be as a unit of account, store of value, medium of exchange, and standard of deferred payment. This is however incompatible with the Arrow–Debreu complete market described above. In the complete market, there is only a one-time transaction at the market &quot;at the beginning of time&quot;. After that, households and producers merely execute their planned productions, consumptions, and deliveries of commodities until the end of time. Consequently, there is no use for storage of value or medium of exchange. This applies not just to the Arrow–Debreu complete market, but also to models (such as those with markets of contingent commodities and Arrow insurance contracts) that differ in form, but are mathematically equivalent to it.

=== Computing general equilibria ===

Scarf (1967) was the first algorithm that computes the general equilibrium. See Scarf (2018) and Kubler (2012) for reviews.

=== Number of equilibria ===

Certain economies at certain endowment vectors may have infinitely equilibrium price vectors. However, &quot;generically&quot;, an economy has only finitely many equilibrium price vectors. Here, &quot;generically&quot; means &quot;on all points, except a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero&quot;, as in Sard&#x27;s theorem.

There are many such genericity theorems. One example is the following:

<text>United Ireland (), also referred to as Irish reunification or a &quot;New Ireland&quot;, is the proposition that all of the island of Ireland should be a single sovereign state. At present, the island is divided politically: the sovereign state of Ireland (legally described also as the Republic of Ireland) has jurisdiction over the majority of Ireland, while Northern Ireland, which lies entirely within (but consists of only 6 of 9 counties of) the Irish province of Ulster, is part of the United Kingdom. Achieving a united Ireland is a central tenet of Irish nationalism and Republicanism, particularly of both mainstream and dissident republican political and paramilitary organisations. Unionists support Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom and oppose Irish unification.

Ireland has been partitioned since May 1921, when the implementation of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 created the states of Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, with the former becoming independent, and the other petitioning to remain a part of the UK. The Anglo-Irish Treaty, which led to the establishment in December 1922 of a dominion called the Irish Free State, recognised partition, but this was opposed by anti-Treaty republicans. When the anti-Treaty Fianna Fáil party came to power in the 1930s, it adopted a new constitution which claimed sovereignty over the entire island. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) had a united Ireland as its goal during the conflict with British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries from the 1960s to the 1990s known as The Troubles. The Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998, which ended the conflict, acknowledged the legitimacy of the desire for a united Ireland, while declaring that it could be achieved only with the consent of a majority of the people of both jurisdictions on the island, and providing a mechanism for ascertaining this in certain circumstances.

In 2016, Sinn Féin called for a referendum on a united Ireland following Brexit, the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU). The decision had increased the perceived likelihood of a united Ireland, in order to avoid the possible requirement for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, though the imposition of a hard border has not, as yet, eventuated. Fine Gael Taoiseach Enda Kenny successfully negotiated that in the event of reunification, Northern Ireland will become part of the EU, just as East Germany was permitted to join the EU&#x27;s predecessor institutions by reuniting with the rest of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The majority of Ulster Protestants, almost half the population of Northern Ireland, favour continued union with Great Britain, and have done so historically. Four of the six counties have Irish Catholic majorities, and majorities voting for Irish nationalist parties, and Catholics have become the plurality in Northern Ireland as of 2021. The religious denominations of the citizens of Northern Ireland are only a guide to likely political preferences, as there are both Protestants who favour a united Ireland, and Catholics who support the union. Two surveys in 2011 identified a significant number of Catholics who favoured the continuation of the union without identifying themselves as unionists or British.
In 2024, a survey showed supporters of the Union in the minority in Northern Ireland for the first time, at 48.6%, while supporters of Irish unity were 33.76%.

==Legal basis for future change==
Article 3.1 of the Constitution of Ireland &quot;recognises that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island&quot;. This provision was introduced in 1999 after implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, as part of replacing the old Articles 2 and 3, which had laid a direct claim to the whole island as the national territory.

The Northern Ireland Act 1998, a statute of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, provides that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom unless a majority of the people of Northern Ireland vote to form part of a united Ireland. It specifies that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland &quot;shall exercise the power [to hold a referendum] if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland&quot;. Such referendums may not take place within seven years of each other.

The Northern Ireland Act 1998 supersedes previous similar legislative provisions. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 also provided that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom unless a majority voted otherwise in a referendum, while under the Ireland Act 1949 the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland was needed for a united Ireland. In 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement affirmed, while providing for devolved government in Northern Ireland, and an advisory role for the Republic of Ireland government, that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.

==History==
===Home Rule, resistance and the Easter Rising===

The Kingdom of Ireland as a whole had become part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Acts of Union 1800. From the 1870s, support for some form of an elected parliament in Dublin grew. In 1870, Isaac Butt, who was a Protestant, formed the Home Government Association, which became the Home Rule League. Charles Stewart Parnell, also a Protestant, became leader in 1880, and the organisation became the Irish National League in 1882. Despite the religion of its early leaders, its support was strongly associated with Irish Catholics. In 1886, Parnell formed a parliamentary alliance with Liberal Party Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and secured the introduction of the First Home Rule Bill. This was opposed by the Conservative Party and led to a split in the Liberal Party, the Liberal Unionist Party. Opposition in Ireland was concentrated in the heavily Protestant counties in Ulster. The difference in religious background was a legacy of the Ulster Plantation in the early seventeenth century. In 1893, the Second Home Rule Bill passed in the House of Commons, but was defeated in the House of Lords, where the Conservatives dominated. A Third Home Rule Bill was introduced in 1912, and in September 1912, just under half a million men and women signed the Ulster Covenant to swear they would resist its application in Ulster. The Ulster Volunteer Force were formed in 1913 as a militia to resist Home Rule.

The Government of Ireland Act 1914 (previously known as the Third Home Rule Bill) provided for a unitary devolved Irish Parliament, a culmination of several decades of work from the Irish Parliamentary Party. It was signed into law in September 1914 in the midst of the Home Rule Crisis and at the outbreak of the First World War. On the same day, the Suspensory Act 1914 suspended its actual operation.In 1916, a group of revolutionaries led by the Irish Republican Brotherhood launched the Easter Rising, during which they issued a Proclamation of the Irish Republic. The rebellion was not successful and sixteen of the leaders were executed. The small separatist party Sinn Féin became associated with the Rising in its aftermath as several of those involved in it were party members.

The Irish Convention held between 1917 and 1918 sought to reach agreement on manner in which Home Rule would be implemented after the war. All Irish parties were invited, but Sinn Féin boycotted the proceedings. By the end of the First World War, a number of moderate unionists came to support Home Rule, believing that it was the only way to keep a united Ireland in the United Kingdom. The Irish Dominion League opposed partition of Ireland into separate southern and northern jurisdictions, while arguing that the whole of Ireland should be granted dominion status with the British Empire.

At the 1918 election Sinn Féin won 73 of the 105 seats; however, there was a strong regional divide, with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) winning 23 of the 38 seats in Ulster. Sinn Féin had run on a manifesto of abstaining from the United Kingdom House of Commons, and from 1919 met in Dublin as Dáil Éireann. At its first meeting, the Dáil adopted the Declaration of Independence of the Irish Republic, a claim which it made in respect of the entire island. Supporters of this Declaration fought in the Irish War of Independence.

===Two jurisdictions===
During this period, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 repealed the previous 1914 Act, and provided for two separate devolved parliaments in Ireland. It defined Northern Ireland as &quot;the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry&quot; and Southern Ireland &quot;so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs&quot;. Section 3 of this Act provided that the parliaments may be united by identical acts of parliament:

Sinn Féin did not recognise this act, treating elections to the respective parliaments as a single election to the Second Dáil. While the Parliament of Northern Ireland sat from 1921 to 1972, the Parliament of Southern Ireland was suspended after its first meeting was boycotted by the Sinn Féin members, who comprised 124 of its 128 MPs. 
A truce in the War of Independence was called in July 1921, followed by negotiations in London between the government of the United Kingdom and a Sinn Féin delegation. On 6 December 1921, they signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which led to the establishment of the Irish Free State the following year, a dominion within the British Empire.

With respect to Northern Ireland, Articles 11 and 12 of the Treaty made special provision for it including as follows:
The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Sir James Craig, speaking in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in October 1922 said that &quot;when 6 December [1922] is passed the month begins in which we will have to make the choice either to vote out or remain within the Free State&quot;. He said it was important that that choice be made as soon as possible after 6 December 1922 &quot;in order that it may not go forth to the world that we had the slightest hesitation&quot;. On 7 December 1922, the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Houses of the Parliament of Northern Ireland resolved to make the following address to the King so as to exercise the rights conferred on Northern Ireland under Article 12 of the Treaty:

The King received it the following day. These steps cemented Northern Ireland&#x27;s legal separation from the Irish Free State.

In Irish republican legitimist theory, the Treaty was illegitimate and could not be approved. According to this theory, the Second Dáil did not dissolve and members of the Republican Government remained as the legitimate government of the Irish Republic declared in 1919. Adherents to this theory rejected the legitimacy of both the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland.

The report of Boundary Commission in 1925 established under the Treaty did not lead to any alteration in the border.

Within Northern Ireland, the Nationalist Party was an organisational successor to the Home Rule Movement, and advocated the end of partition. It had a continuous presence in the Northern Ireland Parliament from 1921 to 1972, but was in permanent opposition to the UUP government.

A new Constitution of Ireland was proposed by Éamon de Valera in 1937 and approved by the voters of the Irish Free State (thereafter simply Ireland). Articles 2 and 3 of this Constitution claimed the whole island of Ireland as the national territory, while claiming legal jurisdiction only over the previous territory of the Irish Free State.
Article 15.2 allowed for the &quot;creation or recognition of subordinate legislatures and for the powers and functions of these legislatures&quot;, which would have allowed for the continuation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland within a unitary Irish state.

In 1946, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill told the Irish High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, &quot;I said a few words in Parliament the other day about your country because I still hope for a United Ireland. You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can&#x27;t do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country.&quot; He later said, &quot;You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don&#x27;t want to go there at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby.&quot;

Under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, Ireland declared that the country may officially be described as the Republic of Ireland and that the President of Ireland had the executive authority of the state in its external relations. This was treated by the British Commonwealth as ending Irish membership. In response, the United Kingdom passed the Ireland Act 1949. Section 1(2) of this act affirmed the provision in the Treaty that the position of Ireland remained a matter for the Parliament of Northern Ireland:
Between 1956 and 1962, the IRA engaged in a border campaign against British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary outposts with the aim of ending British rule in Northern Ireland. This coincided with brief electoral success of Sinn Féin, which won four seats at the 1957 Irish general election. This was its first electoral success since 1927, and it did not win seats in the Republic of Ireland again until 1997. The border campaign was entirely unsuccessful in its aims. In 1957, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote that &quot;I do not think that a United Ireland - with de Valera as a kind of Irish Nehru would do us much good. Let us stand by our friends.&quot;

===Calls for unification, start of the Troubles===
The Northern Ireland civil rights movement emerged in 1967 to campaign for civil rights for Catholics in Northern Ireland. Tensions between republican and loyalist groups in the north erupted into outright violence in the late 1960s. In 1968 the Irish Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, raised the issue of partition in London: &quot;It has been the aim of my government and its predecessors to promote the reunification of Ireland by fostering a spirit of brotherhood among all sections of the Irish people. The clashes in the streets of Derry are an expression of the evils which partition has brought in its train.&quot; He later stated to the press that the ending of partition would be &quot;a just and inevitable solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.&quot;

Lynch renewed his call to end partition in August 1969 when he proposed negotiations with Britain with the hope of merging the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland into a federal type state. Lynch proposed that the two parliaments continue to function with a Council of Ireland having authority over the entire country. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland James Chichester-Clark rejected the proposal. In August 1971 Lynch proposed that the Government of Northern Ireland (Stormont) be replaced with an administration that would share power with Catholics. The next day the Northern Prime Minister Brian Faulkner rejected Lynch&#x27;s statement and stated that &quot;no further attempt by us to deal constructively with the present Dublin government is possible.&quot; Later in 1971 British Labour Party leader (and future Prime Minister) Harold Wilson proposed a plan that would lead to a united Ireland after a 15-year transitional period. He called for the establishment of a commission that would examine the possibility of creating a united Ireland which would be agreed upon by all three parliaments. The northern Prime Minister rejected the proposal and reiterated the desire that Northern Ireland remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. The Irish Taoiseach indicated the possibility of amending the Irish constitution to accommodate the Protestants of Northern Ireland and urged the British government to &quot;declare its interest in encouraging the unity of Ireland&quot;.

In 1969 the British government deployed troops in what would become the longest continuous deployment in British military history Operation Banner. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) had begun a thirty-year campaign against British security forces with the aim of winning a united Ireland.

In 1970, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) was established to campaign for civil rights and a united Ireland by peaceful, constitutional means. The party rose to be the dominant party representing the nationalist community until the early twenty-first century.

In 1972, the parliament of Northern Ireland was suspended, and under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, it was formally abolished. Section 1 of the 1973 Act stated, 
A border poll was held in Northern Ireland in 1973. The SDLP and Sinn Féin called for a boycott of the poll. 98.9% of votes cast supported remaining part of the United Kingdom. The poll was overwhelmingly boycotted by nationalists, and the turnout was therefore 58.7%. The pro-UK vote did however represent 57.5% of the entire electorate, notwithstanding the boycott.

In 1983, the Irish government led by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald established the New Ireland Forum as a consultation on a new Ireland. Though all parties in Ireland were invited, the only ones to attend were Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and the SDLP. Its report considered three options: a unitary state, i.e., a united Ireland; a federal/confederal state; and joint sovereignty. These options were rejected by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In 1985, the governments of Ireland and of the United Kingdom signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement; the British government accepted an advisory role for the Irish government in the future of Northern Ireland. Article 1 of the Agreement stated that the future constitutional position of Northern Ireland would be a matter for the people of Northern Ireland:

In the Downing Street Declaration, Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and Prime Minister John Major issued a joint statement, in which Major, &quot;reiterated on behalf of the British Government, that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland&quot;.

===Good Friday Agreement===

The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 was a culmination of the peace process. The agreement acknowledged nationalism and unionism as &quot;equally legitimate, political aspirations&quot;. In the Northern Ireland Assembly, all members would designate as Unionist, Nationalist, or Other, and certain measures would require cross-community support. The agreement was signed by the governments of Ireland and of the United Kingdom. In Northern Ireland, it was supported by all parties who were in the Northern Ireland Forum with the exception of the Democratic Unionist Party and the UK Unionist Party, and it was supported by all parties in the Oireachtas. It was also opposed by dissident republicans, including Republican Sinn Féin and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement. It was approved in referendums in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.

Included in the Agreement were provisions which became part of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on the form of a future referendum on a united Ireland. In essence the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement provided the opportunity for self determination and mutual respect. Those born in Northern Ireland could identify as Irish, British however despite this people born in Northern Ireland continue to be automatically British citizens no matter what they identify as they are however entitled to but not automatically granted Irish citizenship and can have if they wish both countries passport or passport from either country but none the less remain British citizens unless they renounce that status. The freedom of movement, allowed citizens of either jurisdiction to live in which ever part of the island they wanted, therby enabling them to choose which state they paid taxes to or claimed benefits from. The &#x27;Two state&#x27; solution advocated for conflict resolution in other jurisdictions therefore applied. Provision within the Agreement allows for a simple majority to vote in favour of Irish Unification, but does nothing to explain how the dissolution of the two state solution, leads to a peaceful and prosperous new country when potentially 13% of the &#x27;new&#x27; country are forced into it against their will and have no allegiance to it nor incentive for it to succeed. A fear of political, civil and economic turmoil and a lack of protection for minority rights, as experienced by the Catholic community in Northern Ireland and the Protestant community in the Republic of Ireland historically, is a key driver towards the desire for the maintenance of the status quo on both sides of the border. 
On the establishment of the institutions in 1999, Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland were amended to read:
===Brexit, the Northern Ireland Protocol and elections===
In a referendum in June 2016, England and Wales voted to leave the European Union. The majority of those voting in Northern Ireland and in Scotland, however, voted for the UK to remain. Of the parties in the Assembly, only the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and People Before Profit (PBP) had campaigned for a Leave vote. Irish politicians began the discussion regarding possible changes to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The status and treatment of Northern Ireland and Gibraltar, the only parts under control of the United Kingdom which would have new land borders with the EU following the UK withdrawal, became important to the negotiations, along with access to the regional development assistance scheme (and new funding thereof) from the European Union.

Sinn Féin cited these concerns as the basis for new discussion on a united Ireland. These calls were rejected by the British government and Unionist politicians, with Theresa Villiers arguing that there was no evidence that opinion in Northern Ireland had shifted towards being in favour of a united Ireland. 

==== 2017 Assembly election ====

In the 2017 Assembly election, the DUP lost ten seats and came just one seat ahead of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin used this opportunity to call for a Northern Ireland referendum on a united Ireland.

==== Theoretical return to EU confirmed in a United Ireland ====
The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, confirmed to Mark Durkan, the SDLP MP for Foyle, that in the event of Northern Ireland becoming part of a united Ireland, &quot;Northern Ireland would be in a position of becoming part of an existing EU member state, rather than seeking to join the EU as a new independent state.&quot; Enda Kenny pointed to the provisions that allowed East Germany to join the West and the EEC during the reunification of Germany as a precedent. In April 2017 the European Council acknowledged that, in the event of Irish unification, &quot;the entire territory of such a united Ireland would [...] be part of the European Union.&quot; The SDLP manifesto for the 2017 UK general election called for a referendum on a united Ireland after the UK withdraws from the EU. However the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the time, James Brokenshire, said the conditions for a vote are &quot;not remotely satisfied&quot;.

==== 2017 general election ====
After the 2017 election, the UK government was reliant on confidence and supply from the Democratic Unionist Party. The deal supported the Conservative led government through the Brexit negotiation process. The 2020 Brexit withdrawal agreement included the Northern Ireland Protocol, which established different trade rules for the territory than Great Britain. While Northern Ireland would &quot;de jure&quot; leave the single market, it would still enforce all EU customs rules, while Britain would diverge. This would result in a regulatory &quot;border in the Irish Sea&quot; rather than a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and caused fears from unionist politicians about Brexit causing a weakening of the UK.

==== Brexit negotiations continue ====
The new UK prime minister Boris Johnson continued to claim no trade border would take form as late as August 2020, despite having negotiated its creation. Dominic Cummings later claimed that Johnson did not understand the deal at the time it was signed, while Ian Paisley Jr claimed that Johnson had privately promised to &quot;tear up&quot; the deal after it was agreed. In September, Johnson sought to unilaterally dis-apply parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, despite acknowledging that this broke international law. The bill was rejected by the House of Lords, resulting in several provisions being withdrawn before it passed in December 2020- shortly before the protocol was due to come into effect.

The implementation of the protocol, and the new regulatory hurdles had a negative effect on east–west trade, and drew strong condemnation from unionist figures, including DUP members such as First Minister Arlene Foster. Staff making the required checks were threatened, resulting in a temporary suspension of checks at Larne and Belfast ports. In February 2021, several unionist parties began a legal challenge, alleging that the protocol violated the Act of Union 1800, the bill which had originally merged Ireland with the United Kingdom, as well as the Good Friday Agreement. The challenge was dismissed in June, with the court deciding that the protocol- and other legislation in the intervening 200 years- had effectively repealed parts of the Act of Union. On 4 March the Loyalist Communities Council withdrew its support for the peace agreement- while indicating that opposition to it should not be in the form of violence. Riots erupted in loyalist areas at the end of the month, continuing until 9 April. The protocol&#x27;s implementation, and opposition within the DUP, resulted in the announcement of Foster&#x27;s resignation on 28 April. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; interviewed loyalist Shankill Road residents that month and found significant anger at the DUP, and accusations that the community had been &quot;sold short&quot; on the protocol. Foster was replaced by Paul Givan later that year, though he too resigned in February 2022 over the continued existence of the protocol.

The UK government sought to re-negotiate the protocol, a prospect poorly received by EU leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. When discussing the effects of the protocol in June 2021, Leo Varadkar outlined a vision for a united Irish state with devolved representation in the North. He added &quot;It should be part of our mission as a party to work towards it.&quot; Talks aimed at amending the customs checks required by the protocol began in October; though Maroš Šefčovič indicated that the protocol itself will not be re-negotiated. In December, the UK&#x27;s chief negotiator Lord Frost resigned his post over &quot;concerns about the current direction of travel&quot;.

==== 2022 Assembly election ====

After the results of the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn Féin were set to become the largest party in the assembly for the first time in history, with the DUP coming in second place. Sinn Féin won 27 seats, compared to the DUP&#x27;s 25. Sinn Féin said that it will be at least a decade-long plan for Irish unity, which would only happen after an island-wide conversation.

==== 2023–24 and return to Stormont ====
In February 2023, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced a new agreement called the Windsor Framework including a green lane for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland and a red lane for Republic of Ireland and EU trade. Sinn Fein called for a restoration of devolved governance following the deal whilst the DUP continued their boycott.

On 31 January 2024, a deal between the DUP and the UK government led to the abolition of &quot;routine&quot; checks on goods from Britain sent to Northern Ireland with the intention of staying there. A new body, Intertrade UK will be formed to promote trade within the UK, modelled on the all Ireland body, InterTradeIreland. The deal also includes UK government ministers being compelled to inform Parliament if a Bill they are introducing will have &quot;significant adverse implications for Northern Ireland&#x27;s place in the UK internal market&quot;. On the basis of the deal, the DUP decided to return to devolved governance in Stormont.

On 3 February, Michelle O&#x27;Neill made history by becoming the first-ever Irish nationalist First Minister. After taking office as First Minister, O&#x27;Neill stated that she expected a referendum on the reunification to be held within the next decade, which would be in accordance with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement signed by the UK and Ireland.

==Shared Island==
In 2021, the Irish Government launched the &quot;Shared Island&quot; initiative, to fund projects enhancing cross-border cooperation. In February 2024, it was announced that a total of €1 billion of funding from the Irish government was committed for:

* A5 road (€600m committed)
* Construction of Narrow Water Bridge between the Mourne Mountains and the Cooley Peninsula
* New hourly rail service between Belfast and Dublin
* €50m towards Casement Park
* €10m towards a visitor experience at the Battle of the Boyne site
* Cross-border women’s entrepreneurship

The Narrow Water bridge, linking Omeath to Warrenpoint, began construction in June 2024. During an Ireland&#x27;s Future event in the same month, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar proposed that the Irish government set up a State fund using current budget surpluses that could then be used in the event of a United Ireland. Also at the event, Michelle O&#x27;Neill promised that Casement Park would be built &quot;on my watch&quot;.

== Potential referendum time and criteria ==

=== Timescale proposals ===
In 2020, Ireland Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that a referendum on Irish unity should not be held for 5 years, adding, &quot;once Brexit happened, it should not be a catalyst for something like a border poll. I thought that would be too divisive and would only exacerbate the tensions there because of Brexit itself&quot;.

Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald suggested in 2020 that an &quot;All-Ireland Forum on Unity&quot; be created to plan for all aspects of reunification, including a referendum by 2025, claiming that &quot;Irish Unity is the best idea for the future of the country&quot;. In 2021, Gerry Adams told the Irish Government that it should begin planning for a border poll and that one could happen within three years. 

In April 2022, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said that Northern Ireland does not need a border poll at all and that it would be divisive.

In May 2022, Mary Lou McDonald said that a referendum would be possible within 5 years. First minister elect, Michelle O’Neill launched Sinn Fein&#x27;s manifesto at the Canal Court Hotel in Newry in March 2023 which was a 16-page document including a commitment to set a date on a unity referendum. In February 2024, Mary Lou McDonald said that she expected the referendums to occur by 2030. Political scientist Brendan O&#x27;Leary also suggested the year 2030 as a potential tipping point.

In October 2023, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that it was not currently the right time to hold a referendum because the evidence indicated the referendum would not be won. If a referendum was held, work would need to be done to convince unionists that this was the right path and that a United Ireland would be a &quot;warm home&quot; for them.

The UK government-DUP deal published on 31 January 2024 said there was &quot;no realistic prospect of a border poll&quot;. On 4 February, the day after becoming First Minister, Michelle O&#x27;Neill contested this, outlining her vision of a &quot;decade of opportunity&quot;; in other words, a border poll could be held in 10 years.

=== Criteria ===
In May 2022, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the criteria for a referendum had not yet been met and also called for clarity on the mechanism for a border poll. Michelle O&#x27;Neill also called for clarity on the criteria for a referendum. In September 2022, Northern Ireland shadow secretary Peter Kyle (of the Labour party) said that he would set out border poll criteria.

In the May 2023 Northern Ireland local elections, the three largest unionist parties received over 38 per cent of the vote and the parties in favour of a united Ireland received 41 per cent of the vote. Jeffrey Donaldson suggested that the criteria for a border poll had not been met because unionists had more seats. This however is only true when excluding pro-irish unity independents and People Before Profit. When asked about the criteria, Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said that those interested “need to read the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, it’ll give you a good clue”. In October 2023, Heaton-Harries added that there was no basis to suggest a majority in Northern Ireland currently supported a United Ireland and that the UK government supported all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including the use of a simple majority of &gt;50% in the event of a referendum.

In June 2023, UUP leader Doug Beattie also suggested that the criteria has not been met for a border poll. He added that restoration of the executive would halt a swing in support of Sinn Féin and a United Ireland. Ian Paisley Jr. suggested that support to unify Ireland is not adequate and that should a vote come about, a supermajority and a turnout quota should be required for a border poll. John Major has also called upon the UK government to &quot;spell out&quot; the criteria for a border poll.

==Political positions on a united Ireland==

=== Parties of Ireland ===

Within the Northern Ireland Assembly, MLAs designate as Unionist, Nationalist or Other. The DUP (25 seats), the UUP (9 seats), the TUV (1 seat) and the Independent MLAs Claire Sugden and Alex Easton are designated as Unionist; Sinn Féin (which won 27 seats in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election) and the SDLP (8 seats) are designated as Nationalist; the Alliance Party (17 seats) and PBP (1 seat) are designated as Other. However People Before Profit are in favour of Irish Unity.

Within the Oireachtas, there has traditionally been broad support for a united Ireland, with differences over the twentieth century on how it would be achieved. This includes Sinn Féin, which has had seats in the Dáil since 1997. The initial party constitution of Fianna Fáil in 1926 under Éamon de Valera included as the first of its aims, &quot;To secure the Unity and Independence of Ireland as a Republic&quot;. In 1937, de Valera proposed the Constitution of Ireland which laid claim to the whole island of Ireland. In the 1980s, led by Charles Haughey, the party opposed the consideration of options other than a unitary state in the New Ireland Forum Report and opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement; this stance led in part to the Des O&#x27;Malley and Mary Harney leaving Fianna Fáil and establishing the Progressive Democrats, a party that lasted from 1985 to 2008. Fianna Fáil leaders Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern led Irish governments in favour of the Downing Street Declaration and the Good Friday Agreement respectively.

When formed in 1933, Fine Gael initially used the subtitle &quot;United Ireland&quot;. Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald convened the New Ireland Forum in 1983 and negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement. In the aftermath of the vote on Brexit, Enda Kenny sought assurances on the position of Northern Ireland in the case of a united Ireland. The Irish Labour Party has adopted a similar approach to Fine Gael in government to a united Ireland.

==== Minor parties ====
In a survey of TDs conducted by &quot;TheJournal.ie&quot; on support for a border poll and a united Ireland conducted in December 2016, only TDs from the Anti-Austerity Alliance (now Solidarity) stated they were opposed to a united Ireland at the present moment.

There are a number of minor nationalist parties, including the Irish Republican Socialist Party, which supports a united socialist Irish state and is affiliated with the Irish National Liberation Army. Another such party, Republican Sinn Féin, linked to the Continuity IRA, maintain the Irish republican legitimist theory that neither state in Ireland is legitimate. Its &quot;Éire Nua&quot; (in English, &quot;New Ireland&quot;) policy advocates a unified federal state with regional governments for the four provinces and the national capital in Athlone. None of these parties has significant electoral support.

=== British parties ===
Of the British parties, the Conservative Party is explicitly unionist; it has formally been called the &quot;Conservative and Unionist Party&quot; since a merger with the Liberal Unionist Party in 1912. The UUP was affiliated with the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations until 1985. The Northern Ireland Conservatives are a minor unionist party in Northern Ireland.

Historically, there has been support for a united Ireland within the left of the British Labour Party, and in the 1980s it became official policy to support a united Ireland by consent. The policy of &quot;unity by consent&quot; continued into the 1990s, eventually being replaced by a policy of neutrality in line with the Downing Street Declaration. The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn supports a united Ireland, although he has said that it is &quot;up for the Irish people to decide&quot; whether to remain part of the UK. They do not organise electorally in Northern Ireland, respecting the SDLP as their sister party within the Party of European Socialists. Similarly, the Liberal Democrats co-operate with the Alliance Party and share their support of the Good Friday Agreement while expressing reservations about what they perceive as &#x27;institutionalised sectarianism&#x27; in the agreement. Former Alliance leader Lord Alderdice is a member of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords. One supporter of a United Ireland in the Liberal Democrats was Michael Meadowcroft, MP for Leeds West between 1983 and 1987.

== Issues ==
=== Arguments for ===

==== Economic ====
Neale Richmond of Fine Gael says that unifying Ireland as a unitary state within the EU would benefit the economy across the island. He also argues it would allow the simplification of the systems of healthcare, public transport, education and more.

Sinn Féin says that economic powers held in London contribute to Northern Ireland being the slowest growing economy of the British Isles and also negatively impacts the economy of the Republic of Ireland. They cite lower paid and less secure jobs in the North and say that a United Ireland would allow for a more coordinated economic strategy and increasing investment, productivity and improving infrastructure, particularly in the border region. Sinn Féin also suggests that unity will improve public revenue returns, overall output, and higher-skilled employment.

==== Cultural ====

The Irish rugby team has been cited has a unifying force across Ireland and a &quot;gesture of unity&quot;. The team has been described as &quot;showing the best what island has to offer&quot; and has sometimes been described as a United Ireland team.

==== Reconciliation ====
Jim O&#x27;Callaghan of Fianna Fáil suggests that a United Ireland would bring people on the island closer together, reconcile old conflicts and increase the number of opportunities for young people.

=== Arguments against ===

==== Identity ====
Many Unionist Protestants in Northern Ireland argue they have a distinct identity that would be overwhelmed in a united Ireland. They cite the decline of the small Protestant population of the Republic of Ireland since independence from the United Kingdom, the economic cost of unification, their place in a key international player within the UK and their mainly non-Irish ancestry. Unionist people in Northern Ireland primarily find their cultural and ethnic identity from the Scottish and English planters (colonists), whose descendants can be found in the three counties of Ulster which are governed by the Republic of Ireland. Such individuals celebrate their Scots heritage each year like their counterparts in the other six counties. While Catholics in general consider themselves to be Irish, Protestants generally see themselves as British, as shown by several studies and surveys performed between 1971 and 2006.

Many Protestants do not consider themselves as primarily Irish, as many Irish nationalists do, but rather within the context of an Ulster or British identity. A 1999 survey showed that a little over half of Protestants felt &quot;Not at all Irish&quot;, while the rest &quot;felt Irish&quot; in varying degrees.

== Constitutional options ==
A report by University College London found four constitutional options for a United Ireland;

* A single central legislature in e.g Dublin. This model is considered the historic choice for many Irish republicans but may not be seen as favourable by some unionists.
* Maintain the devolved institutions in the North but with sovereignty transferred from London to Dublin.
* A two unit federal state.
* A confederation of two independent states. UCL suggested this would not meet the terms of unity as clearly (1998 Belfast Good Friday Agreement).

== In popular culture ==
The 1990 episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;The High Ground&quot;, featured a discussion between Data and Jean-Luc Picard which states that Ireland was unified in 2024. As a result, this episode was not originally shown by the BBC in the United Kingdom due to the Troubles. It was not broadcast in the Republic of Ireland by the &quot;Star Trek&quot; rights&#x27; holder, RTÉ, during the show&#x27;s run though UK broadcasts were received there. Initial UK airings were edited and shown for the first time on the satellite channel Sky One on November 29, 1992. The episode was finally broadcast unedited, 16 years later, in May 2006 on Sky One and shown unedited on BBC Two during the third season&#x27;s repeats after midnight on September 29, 2007.

<text>[[Civil union]]s in Quebec are available in Quebec to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, which attempts to create the same rights for the partners as a traditional marriage.

As a result of a range of activism and to the &quot;M. v. H.&quot; decision, the National Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously in 2002 to amend the Civil Code of Quebec to create a status of civil union in Quebec, available to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples and largely having the same rights as marriage. The law was enacted on June 24, 2002.

A civil union is contracted into by same-sex or opposite-sex partners 18 years of age and older, who are not otherwise married, not in another civil union, or who are not closely related, following prescribed formalities similar to the regime of marriage. The civil union carries obligations and benefits equivalent to that of marriage including the obligation of support (CCQ art. 585) and the establishment of a family patrimony and family residence (CCQ art. 521.6) and may otherwise be modified by a contract (CCQ 521.8) similar to a pre-nuptial agreement and may agree to a particular property regime similar to available matrimonial regimes. It creates a family connection between the spouses and their relatives (CCQ art. 521.7).

Judicial conciliation is merited &quot;when the spouses cannot agree on their rights and performance of their duties&quot; (CCQ art. 521.9). Such union may be annulled within three years if irregularly contracted (CCQ arts. 521.10-521.11). A civil union ends at death of one of the partners or may be dissolved by judicial dissolution or by a &#x27;transaction agreement&#x27; and &#x27;joint declaration&#x27; before a civil law notary and recorded &quot;en minute&quot; if both partners consent and they settle all the consequences of the dissolution (CCQ arts. 521.13-521.16). 

Judicial dissolution is merited when &quot;the interests of the common children of the spouses are at stake&quot; or where the parties cannot otherwise agree (CCQ art. 521.17 para. 1). Provisional orders of support, custody and access may be entered during the pendency of the dissolution action (CCQ art. 521.71 para. 2) and the court may, upon or after pronouncing dissolution decide maintenance, custody and education issues in the best interests of and with due regard to the rights of the children (CCQ art. 521.17, para. 3).

The act establishing the regime of civil union also modified rules creating filiation for biological children of one of the partners, and for adopted children as well as the recognition of parental authority and child support obligations so they will apply to civil union couples as well as married couples.

In March 2004, Quebec same-sex couples won the right to marry. Today, couples (both opposite- and same-sex) can choose between civil marriage and civil unions.

<text>Service discovery is the process of automatically detecting devices and services on a computer network. It aims to reduce the manual configuration effort required from users and administrators. A service discovery protocol (SDP) is a network protocol that helps accomplish service discovery. 

Service discovery requires a common language to allow software agents to make use of one another&#x27;s services without the need for continuous user intervention.

==Protocols==
There are many service discovery protocols, including:
* Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)
* Bonjour, e.g., Apple AirPrint
* DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a component of zero-configuration networking
* DNS, as used for example in Kubernetes
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
* Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS)
* Jini for Java objects.
* Lightweight Service Discovery (LSD), for mobile ad hoc networks 
* Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) standards-based neighbor discovery protocol similar to vendor-specific protocols which find each other by advertising to vendor-specific broadcast addresses (versus all-1&#x27;s), such Cabletron (Enterasys) and Cisco Discovery Protocol (both referred to as CDP but different formats). 
* Local Peer Discovery, or Local Service Discovery
* Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP), usually used for unicast exchange of multicast source information between anycast Rendez-Vous Points (RPs) to service mcast clients. 
* Service Location Protocol (SLP)
* Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) used to discover RTP sessions
* Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), a component of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
* Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) for web services
* Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD)
* WS-Discovery (Web Services Dynamic Discovery)
* XMPP Service Discovery (XEP-0030)
* XRDS (eXtensible Resource Descriptor Sequence) used by XRI, OpenID, OAuth, etc.

<text>Ivone Aida Lopes Fernandes Ramos (September 7, 1926 – March 3, 2018) was a Cape Verdean writer.

==Biography==
She was born to Armando Napoleão Rodrigues Fernandes and Alice Lopes da Silva Fernandes. She belonged to a family of great literary figures including her uncles José Lopes da Silva, the poet, her cousins were António Aurélio Gonçalves and Baltasar Lopes da Silva, her sister was Orlanda Amarílis and her brother in law was Manuel Ferreira.

At age 6, she returned to Assomada. She enjoyed reading since she was a child, her favorite genres were political novels, love, and spy stories, medieval books and others, her father opened a library house where she lived. In this way, she grew up and was educated about local and world problems.

She later moved to the island of São Vicente and lived in her uncle&#x27;s house, the writer António Aurélio Gonçalves, where she started to write stories and folklore books from Cape Verde, because she knew and liked to tell him. These stories had been told by her neighbors, their housewives and the elders in Santa Catarina and São Nicolau, in the yard and the house door, with the starry sky and the boys sitting and telling stories. These were tales of sorcerers, persons with extraordinary powers or the hero that went on a mission full of danger. She never called or cared about the writer.

Only much, much, later on, these stories provided an inspiration for writing a series of books. Her first book was &quot;Vidas Vividas&quot; published in 1990. She re-edited her father&#x27;s book &quot;Léxico do dialecto crioulo do arquipélago de Cabo Verde&quot; in 1990 in Mindelo. She later wrote more stories including &quot;Futcera ta cendê na Rotcha&quot; (2000) and &quot;Exilada&quot; (2005). Later in 2009 she published a children&#x27;s short story book titled &quot;Mam Bia tita conta estória na criol&quot; (Mãe Bia está a contar histórias em crioulo).

A dressmaker, tailor (or snider) made clothes and had an artistic side expressed through handcrafts, and confection of traditional pieces such as patchwork quilt, pockets of market vendors, embroidery, cloth dolls and many with decoration.

==Personal life==
She later married Arnaldo da Silva Gonçalves and raised children, one of whom, Carlos Filipe Gonçalves, is a journalist.

<doc id="1239600" wikidata="Q5567211" url="?curid=1239600" title="Glastonbury Canal">
<text>The Glastonbury Canal ran for approximately through two locks from Glastonbury to Highbridge in Somerset, England, where it entered the River Parrett and from there the Bristol Channel. The canal was authorised by Parliament in 1827 and opened in 1834. It was operated by the Glastonbury Navigation and Canal Company. Most of it was abandoned as a navigation in 1854, when a railway was built along the towpath.

An earlier canal had been built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was proposed to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.

==Background==
Glastonbury is situated in an area of low-lying land, known as the Somerset Levels, through which rivers and drainage ditches (locally called &quot;rhynes&quot;) run. There is evidence that the town was served by a medieval canal connecting it to the river system in the Saxon period, and the waterways were later used by the monks who were located at Glastonbury Abbey, both for draining the land and for transport of produce. In the 1750s, the town became a spa town, when the waters of the Chalice Well spring were thought to have medicinal properties, but this did not last for long, while the predominant wool and cloth industries declined as the mills of the north of England took the trade.

The area was hit by severe floods in 1794, as a result of which the Commissioners of Sewers obtained the Somerset Drainage Act 1801 (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. lxxii), which allowed them to improve the course of the River Brue by the straightening of major loops at Highbridge and East Huntspill, and to construct the North and South Drains, which collected water from the peat moorlands and channelled it into the lower River Brue. Under the terms of the act, two small canals, called Galton&#x27;s Canal and Brown&#x27;s Canal, were built near the North Drain to serve peat extraction workings. The drainage works were not wholly successful in preventing flooding, and the Commissioners often failed to obtain the levies they required to finance their operations.

==Promotion and planning==
One of the key promoters for a canal was Richard Prat, who was a lawyer in Glastonbury, had been the town clerk since 1813, and held several important offices in the town. He saw the canal as a way to halt the economic downturn in the town and its drainage problems, and called a meeting in August 1825, at which a firm plan was formulated. Richard Hammett, a local man from Street, was commissioned to conduct a survey of the route in 1826. Hammett had experience of building a manure canal through peat heathland. He considered two main routes; the first followed the course of the River Brue, but was rejected on the grounds of engineering costs, and the interference with its drainage function. The second route followed the South Drain, which had been newly constructed following floods in 1794, to connect with the River Brue near Cripps Bridge, and to re-use the old course of that River at Highbridge to create a basin.

Hammett estimated that the main work required on the section from Highbridge to the South Drain would be the provision of a towpath. After this, the South Drain would need to be made wider and deeper, but this would aid its drainage function, and would reduce the levy on the local landowners, as the canal company would then be responsible for its maintenance. Two locks would be required on this upper section, with a total rise of just . He did not believe that cutting a canal through peat would present serious engineering problems as a result of his previous experience with the manure canal, but he seriously underestimated the cost at £9,000.
A prospectus was issued which contained a detailed breakdown of the likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promoters prepared to obtain an act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs were likely to be £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. xli), which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett&#x27;s plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.

==Construction==
Construction began once the necessary land had been purchased, but it soon became apparent that the original surveys were inadequate. The canal engineer John Rennie was asked to advise the proprietors, and proposed three options, for boats of , for boats of , and for barges which were wide. The first was ruled out on cost, the third because of the need to transship all goods at Highbridge, and the second was adopted because it allowed the coasters that worked the Bristol Channel to use the canal. This option required locks of by , and was costed at £28,720. The route would be as authorised, but a single lock was required on the upper section to simplify the water supply. Work resumed in July 1828.

At the Glastonbury end, the canal was required to cross the South Drain and the River Brue. Rennie suggested inverted syphons, rather than locking down into the river and up again, and a cast iron aqueduct for the River Brue crossing was obtained for nearly £3,000 from a Glastonbury blacksmith called John Wright. At the Highbridge end, the plans for a floating harbour to accommodate vessels of up to were dropped, and the entrance lock was moved further along the original course of the River Brue. This saved money, but meant that ships did not have to pay lockage charges to reach Highbridge.

The proprietors failed to raise all of the capital promised, and there were financial difficulties. The Commissioners of Sewers were unhappy with some of the work at Highbridge in 1830, and reported that the contractor &quot;had run away&quot;, and work had stopped in 1831. The company had also failed to lodge £1,000 with the Commissioners which was required to cover any costs they might have as a result of the construction of the canal, and they sued for the money in 1831. Even Rennie threatened to sue, as much of his fee remained unpaid. The cost of construction was about £30,000, but it appears that some debts were never paid. On 16 December 1831 the proprietors borrowed £5,000 from the Exchequer at a 5% rate of interest.

==Opening==

The canal finally opened on 15 August 1833, amid celebrations at both ends of the canal and a cavalcade to and from Highbridge to Glastonbury. A second celebration for the &quot;respectable trading classes&quot; was held nine days later. The first cargo of wood from Canada arrived in July 1835. The canal appears to have been successful initially, but the revenues generated were inadequate, and there were problems with water levels on the upper section. In 1840, the Prat brothers, whose legal firm had played a major part in the creation of the canal, disappeared, leaving a financial shortfall of over £40,000. It appears that they had put up most of the extra costs of construction, and may have borrowed some money from client&#x27;s funds. They were declared bankrupt and Richard Prat was removed from office as town clerk and a Commissioner of Sewers, but the firm&#x27;s collapse had a serious effect on the prosperity of Glastonbury.

On the upper section, the final pond prevented the proper drainage of the surrounding land, which being composed of peat, started to swell. This caused the canal itself to rise and the clay puddling to fracture, resulting in further loss of water, and a reduced depth for navigation. Traffic had to be transhipped to smaller boats at Highbridge, which added to the costs of delivery. Receipts for 1848 were £300, which would indicate that the canal was probably only carrying about per annum.

==Closure==

Railways arrived in the area in 1841, with the opening of part of the Bristol and Exeter Railway on 14 June, which eventually reached Exeter in 1844. In late 1846, the railway company attempted to buy the canal to prevent its use by rival railway companies. The sale was agreed in principle in June 1847, and was authorised by an act of Parliament passed on 30 June 1848. The shareholders received £7,372 in 1850, and the canal company was dissolved in 1851.

There was friction between the new owners and the Commissioners of Sewers. The railway company proposed the creation of a railway between Highbridge and Glastonbury in 1850, and the Somerset Central Railway was authorised by Parliament on 17 June 1852. The canal was transferred to the new company, and was used to speed the construction of the railway, earning £312 in the year ending September 1853. The line followed the route of the canal closely, with much of it built on the towpath. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854.

The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966, while the branches to the dairy at Bason Bridge and the Highbridge Wharf lasted until 1972.

==Route==

The canal started at a lock constructed on the old course of the River Brue, which had been bypassed by a new cut in 1801 and filled in. It then followed the course of the Brue to Cripps Bridge, after which it followed the Cripps River to Gold Corner. The first part of the Cripps River was originally part of a loop on the River Brue, which was bypassed by a new cut made under the 1801 act. Gold Corner is at the point where the Huntspill River, the Cripps River and the South Drain meet.

Following the course of the enlarged South Drain, a lock raised the level of the canal at Shapwick, while the Drain turned off to run parallel to the canal but to its north. The railway ran between the two waterways, crossing to the south side of the canal immediately after the single arched aqueduct and syphon over the South Drain. The remains of the three-arched aqueduct and syphon over the River Brue are still visible, near the old railway bridge, and from there the canal headed towards Glastonbury, passing the Ham Wall and Street Heath nature reserves and making a sharp right-hand turn just before its terminal basin, which was located near the old Glastonbury and Street railway station.

<text>The Narodowy Bank Polski (; the National Bank of Poland), often abbreviated to NBP, is the central bank of Poland, founded in 1945. It controls the issuing of Poland&#x27;s currency, the Polish złoty. The bank is headquartered in Warsaw, and has branches in 16 major Polish cities. The NBP represents Poland in the European System of Central Banks, an EU organization. The bank doesn&#x27;t translate its name to English and uses its Polish name in all English communications.

==History==
Although the bank has existed under its current name since 1945, it claims the legacy of two previous central banks, both named Bank of Poland (). The First Bank of Poland was founded in Warsaw in 1828 by Prince Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki under the government of the Kingdom of Poland. The Second Bank of Poland, founded in 1924, was the central bank of the Second Polish Republic.

During the Second World War the gold reserves of Poland were transferred to Romania, Great Britain and Canada. In November 1946, following the cancellation of Poland&#x27;s wartime debt, the larger part of prewar gold reserves were returned to new communist authorities. In 1947, the gold deposited in Romania in 1939 was returned, while the former Bank of Poland itself was closed down and finally in 1952 absorbed by the newly created Narodowy Bank Polski.

The latter was one of two banks allowed to operate in Poland&#x27;s postwar planned economy. It had a monopoly for currency, credits and accumulation of savings. The other bank, PKO Bank Polski, was responsible for private accounts. After the fall of the communist system in 1989, the market economy was reintroduced and the NBP limited its functions to currency control and supervision of other, privately controlled banks.

==Structure==
The structure and functioning of the Narodowy Bank Polski are regulated by article 227 of the Constitution of Poland of 1997 and the Narodowy Bank Polski Act of the same year. The president of the NBP is appointed by the Sejm, at the request of the president of the Republic of Poland, for a term of six years. The NBP president is responsible for the organisation and functioning of the Polish&#x27;s central bank. The same person cannot serve as president of the NBP for more than two terms of office. Apart from his function as the superior of the NBP staff, he is also the chairman of the Monetary Policy Council, the NBP management board and the Commission for Banking Supervision. He is also responsible for representing Poland in international banking and financial institutions.

In 2019, the average employment at the National Bank of Poland on full-time amounts was 3312 people.

<doc id="1239608" wikidata="Q919374" url="?curid=1239608" title="Gama Goat">
<text>The Gama Goat was a six-wheel drive semi-amphibious off-road vehicle originally developed for use by the US military in the Vietnam War. The Goat uses an articulated chassis, so that from distance it appears to be a four-wheel drive vehicle pulling a two-wheel trailer, but it is a single six-wheel vehicle with a four-wheel steering arrangement with the front and rear wheels turning in opposite directions. It was famous for its ability to travel over exceptionally rough and muddy terrain.

The vehicle&#x27;s nickname came from two sources: &quot;Gama&quot; from the name of the inventor of its powered articulated joint, Roger Gamaunt, and &quot;Goat&quot; for its mountain goat-like off-road ability. Its military designation was M561, 6×6 tactical 1¼-ton truck. There was also an ambulance version known as the M792. The vehicle was replaced by a variety of Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicles (CUCVs) and Humvees.

==History==
The concept for the vehicle came when the French Army reported that the United States Army trucks provided to them were woefully inadequate for the terrain in Vietnam. In 1959, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) (now known as DARPA) funded a research project called Project &quot;Agile&quot; to develop a new tactical truck for the Southeast Asia theatre, as well as other projects of interest to the then-looming Vietnam War.

Of 50 companies solicited for XM561 proposals, six entered the competition, including Clark, General Motors and LeTourneau Technologies, but on 15 March 1963, the research &amp; development contract was awarded to Chance Vought division of LTV Aerospace, Dallas, Texas, best known for their combat aircraft (though, actually the company did have some experience in designing ground vehicles, particularly, a predecessor of Gama Goat, but they didn&#x27;t have the truck assembly lines and production experience comparable to those of the mentioned car manufacturers). The principal competitor to the Goat was a tracked XM571 Articulated Utility Carrier developed by Canadair Ltd. of Montreal (yet another aerospace company,) which eventually lost the contest. The research and development contract for the Goat was completed by LTV at cost of about $8.7 million, over three times more expensive than when it had been awarded.

The vehicle weighed almost three times as much as originally requested by the military and specified by the operational requirements (). Field testing had not been completed before the mass production order had been issued. During the field tests, it had not been able to go without a breakdown.

Final construction of the vehicles was conducted by the Consolidated Diesel Electric Company (CONDEC) at their factory in Charlotte, North Carolina (on 11 June 1968, the Army awarded them a 3-year contract for 15,274 vehicles, 13,516 Army and 1,758 Marine Corps, at a total price of about $132.1 million, on the same day Detroit Diesel Division of General Motors received $30 million 3-year contract for the engines). CONDEC also had factories in Schenectady, New York, where the Gama Goat was originally manufactured, and in Greenwich, Connecticut, where the parts for the Gama Goat were produced. In the early 1960s, the company moved to Waterbury, Connecticut for a few years, then closed their plants in New York and Connecticut to move to Charlotte, North Carolina for cheaper labor and facilities.

The Gama Goat was replaced in the late 1980s by a variety of CUCVs and &quot;Humvees&quot; (HMMWV).

==Description==
Overall, some 14,274 Gama Goats were built at a cost of US$8,000 each (1965 dollars; ); this was considered quite high at the time. 12,516 were slated for the US Army and 1,758 for the USMC. While the Gama Goat had exceptional off-road ability, its quirky steering made it hard to handle on pavement, and its tendency to flounder in amphibious operations required drivers to have special training in order to operate it. This meant that it could not be the &quot;general purpose&quot; vehicle the Army had hoped for, and production was halted after the original contract expired.

The air-cooled engine used in the original prototypes overheated in use, and was replaced in the production vehicles with a liquid-cooled Detroit 3-53 Diesel engine. Due to the high-intensity noise from the two-stroke Diesel engine, the drivers required hearing protection. The double hull construction and complex articulated drivetrain made maintenance difficult (the lubrication order alone took around six hours). In service in Vietnam, Gama Goats would often be sent out ahead of other vehicles in order to arrive at their destination at the same time.

While technically listed as amphibious, the Gama Goat&#x27;s swimming capability was limited to smooth water crossings of ponds, canals and streams due to the very low freeboard and the lack of a propeller. Propulsion in the water was supplied by the six spinning wheels, and bilge pumps were standard equipment. Drivers had to remember to close the hull&#x27;s drain openings before swimming the vehicles. Some models had extra equipment installed that made them too heavy to swim, such as heavy-duty winches, communications shelters that made them top heavy, or radar gear.

It was designed to be air-transportable and droppable by parachute.

<doc id="1239618" wikidata="Q1543413" url="?curid=1239618" title="Green sunfish">
<text>The green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) is a species of aggressive freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Centrarchiformes. The green sunfish does not always grow large enough to be an appealing target for anglers, but it is kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists. They grow to be long on average, but can achieve a length of .

==Geographic distribution==
The green sunfish is native to a wide area of North America, from the Rocky Mountains in the west to the Appalachian Mountains in the east and from the Hudson Bay basin in Canada to the Gulf Coast in the United States and northern Mexico. They are specifically indigenous to a number of lakes and rivers, such as the Great Lakes and some of the basins of the Mississippi River.

Green sunfish have been introduced to many bodies of water all across the United States. The green sunfish is considered an invasive species by the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and New Jersey, with unconfirmed presence in Vermont and New Hampshire, namely the Connecticut River and its tributaries. Their invasive potential is due in part to their penchant for chasing other sunfish away from mutually preferred habitat of submerged vegetation, a form of interference competition, their relatively large mouth, high fecundity and ability to tolerate sediment pollution. In the state of New Jersey, as of 2021, anglers must destroy green sunfish when caught and should report their catch to a state fisheries biologist. In the state of Florida, a permit is required in order to possess green sunfish as it is listed as a prohibited non-native species there. &quot;L. cyanellus&quot; has been transplanted to countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe, where it has become established in some.

==Description==
The green sunfish is blue-green in color on its back and sides with yellow-flecked bony-ridged (ctenoid) scales, as well as yellow coloration on the ventral sides. The gill covers and sides of head have broken bright blue stripes, causing some to mistakenly confuse them with bluegill. They also have a dark spot located near the back end of the dorsal fin, the base of the anal fin and on the opercular flap. The margins of the soft-rayed portion of the dorsal fin, the caudal fin, the ventral fins and the anal fin are orange or yellow, most pronounced in individuals during breeding periods. &quot;L. cyanellus&quot; has a relatively big mouth and long snout that extends to beneath the middle of the eye. Its pectoral fins are short with rounded edges containing 13 to 15 pectoral fin rays, a dorsal fin with about 10 dorsal spines followed by 10 to 12 rays and a homocercal tail. The typical length ranges from about 3–7 in and the fish usually weighs less than a pound. The green sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about , with a maximum recorded weight of . Identification of sunfish species from one another can sometimes be difficult as these species frequently hybridize.

==Habitat==

The species prefers areas in sluggish backwaters, lakes, and ponds with gravel, sand, or bedrock bottoms. They also can be found in very muddy waters and are able to tolerate poor water conditions. Green sunfish tend to spend their time hiding around rocks, submerged logs, plants, and other things that provide cover.

==Diet==
Its diet can include aquatic insects and larvae, insects that fall into the water, crayfish, snails, other molluscs, turtle food, frogs, some small fish, fish eggs, bryozoans, zooplankton, other small invertebrates, and sometimes plant material. They are omnivores.

==Reproduction==

Green sunfish begin spawning in the summer with the exact time varying with location and water temperature. When they do spawn, the males create nests in shallow water by clearing depressions in the bottom, often near a type of shelter such as rocks or submerged logs. The male defends his nest from other males using visual displays and physical force when necessary. On occasion, simply constructing a nest is sufficient for the male to attract a mate, but when it is not he will court a female with grunts and lead her to his nest.

They continue their courtship dance, swimming with each other around the nest until the female descends to deposit her eggs in the nest. The female will lay 2,000 to 26,000 eggs and leave them for the male to guard. He keeps watch over them until they hatch in three to five days, while protecting them and fanning them with his fins, keeping them clean and providing them with oxygenated water. When they hatch, the fry remain near the nest for a few days, then leave to feed and fend for themselves. After the eggs have hatched, the male will often seek to attract another female to lay her eggs in his nest. &quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot; typically live between 4 and 6 years in the wild.

Green sunfish tend to nest in areas close to other green sunfish, as well as other species of sunfish. Due to the close proximity of multiple nests, a green sunfish female may deposit some of her eggs into the nest of a male of a different species. This in turn leads to the next generation containing some amount of hybrids. These green sunfish hybrids will often look like a combination of their parents, often making it difficult to distinguish one species from another.

==Anatomy and physiology==

The retina of the green sunfish includes a mosaic of cone cells and double cone cells in a regular arrangement. The green sunfish has been theorized to have vision that is sensitive to the polarization of light, which could enhance visibility of targets in scattering media if a processing technique called polarization difference imaging is employed by the fish. Experimental evidence, however, suggests that green sunfish are not able to visually discriminate on the basis of light polarization. Thus, the function of the green sunfish&#x27;s retinal patterning is not known, although the two different types of cone cell present in green sunfish do facilitate color discrimination.

==IGFA records==
The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all-tackle world record for the species stands at , caught from Stockton Lake, Missouri in 1971.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Lepomis&quot; derives from the Greek λεπίς (scale) and πώμα (cover, plug, operculum). The specific epithet, &quot;cyanellus,&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;κυανός&quot; (blue).

== Aquaria ==
An aggressive sunfish, it is difficult to keep with other green sunfishes, other sunfishes, or even other perciform fishes in general unless kept in very spacious aquaria or ponds. Like many fishes, it is more tolerant of distantly related species (i.e., catfishes and minnows), if they are too large to be eaten. The green sunfish accepts a variety of foods, including flakes, pellets, krill, brine shrimp, bloodworms, and live prey.

<doc id="1239619" wikidata="Q235062" url="?curid=1239619" title="Galeras">
<text>Galeras (Urcunina among the 16th-century indigenous people) is an Andean stratovolcano in the Colombian department of Nariño, near the departmental capital Pasto. Its summit rises above sea level. It has erupted frequently since the Spanish conquest, with its first historical eruption being recorded on December 7, 1580. A 1993 eruption killed nine people, including six scientists who had descended into the volcano&#x27;s crater to sample gases and take gravity measurements in an attempt to be able to predict future eruptions. It is currently the most active volcano in Colombia.

== Geological history ==

Galeras has been an active volcano for at least a million years, with andesite as the dominant product. Two major caldera-forming eruptions have occurred, the first about 560,000 years ago in an eruption which expelled about of material. The second some time between 40,000 and 150,000 years ago, in a smaller but still sizable eruption of of material. Subsequently, part of the caldera wall has collapsed, possibly due to instabilities caused by hydrothermal activity, and later eruptions have built up a smaller cone inside the now horseshoe-shaped caldera.

In light of its violent eruptive history and proximity to the 450,000 people of Pasto, Galeras was designated a Decade Volcano in 1991, identifying it as a target for detailed study as part of the United Nations&#x27; International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.

== Eruptive history ==

Galeras is considered the most active volcano in Colombia, followed by Nevado del Ruiz. Its earliest activity during the Holocene has been dated at 7050 BC ± 1000 years through radiocarbon dating. Other eruptions similar to this event include those in 3150 BC ± 200 years, 2580 BC ± 500 years, 1160 BC ± 300 years, 490 BC ± 100 years, and in 890 AD ± 200 years. Typically these eruptions consist of a central vent explosion, conducive to an explosive eruption causing pyroclastic flows and/or lahars. Eruptions in more recent times, which have been recorded consist of those in 1535, December 1580, July 1616, 1641, 1670, 1754, November 1796, June 1823, October 1828, 1834, October 1865, July 1889, 1891, December 1923, October 1924, October 1932, February 1936, July 1947, January 1950, 1974, February 1989, January 1990, January 1993, March 2000, June 2002, July 2004, November 2005, October 2007, January 2008, February 2009, March 2009, January 2010, and August 2010. Reported incidents with no official proof occurred in 1836, 1930, 1933, and 1973.

=== 1993 eruption ===

Galeras became active again in 1988 after 10 years of dormancy.

A Decade Volcano conference in the city of Pasto, in 1993, ended in disaster when several of the scientists present mounted an impromptu expedition on 14 January to the crater of Galeras. An eruption occurred unexpectedly while they were at the summit, resulting in the deaths of six scientists and three tourists.

Elements in the media made the event controversial by suggesting the expedition leader, geologist Stanley Williams, who survived along with four others, had ignored safety procedures. A prediction had been made three days before the eruption based on B-Type activity seen on a seismograph. Seismic B-types had been used successfully to predict eruptions on other volcanoes. However, the prediction was based simply on the one seismographic printout viewed in the light of previous history of Galeras, without any additional scientific measurements showing any serious activity within the volcano.

== 21st-century activity ==
Activity at a low level has continued at Galeras, with small explosions occasionally dusting nearby villages and towns with ash. The volcano has continued to be well-studied, and predictions of eruptions at the volcano have improved. One phenomenon, which seems to be a reliable precursor to eruptive activity, is a low-frequency seismic event known as a tornillo event. These have occurred before about four-fifths of the explosions at Galeras, and the number of tornillo events recorded before an eruption is also correlated with the size of the ensuing eruption.

More than 100 minor tremors were felt during a major eruption in April 2002, although no damage or injury was reported. An eruption in November 2005 forced an evacuation of the dangerous area surrounding the volcano, and about 9,400 people from nearby villages (most of them farmers) were ordered to leave. The city of Pasto, about from the volcano, was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion, forcing the residents to don goggles and face masks.

Numerous minor tremors and ash emissions since March 2006 culminated on 12 July 2006 in three explosive eruptions, producing an ash and gas column reaching an altitude of . Rock falls and pyroclastic flows were reported from towns as distant as Consacá, west of the main crater. The Colombian government has repeatedly ordered evacuations to temporary shelters, of more than 8500 people residing in the highest risk areas surrounding the volcano, with hopes of eventual assistance toward permanent relocation.

On January 17, 2008, the volcano erupted around 20:06 (local) (01:06 UTC). There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. Later the experts confirmed partial damage in the national and local TV towers.

Then, on February 14, 2009, the volcano erupted around 19:10 (local) (00:10 UTC). Some 8,000 residents were evacuated, and there were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. As in 2005, the city of Pasto was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion (due to the direction of the wind). The local authorities ordered two water treatment plants near Galeras to shut down.

On March 13, 2009, Galeras erupted twice at around 15:55 and 17:00 (local time). Ash fell on Pasto and some other towns near the volcano, where an evacuation was ordered but reportedly ignored. No injuries or damage were reported.

=== 2010 eruption ===
The volcano erupted on January 3, 2010, forcing the evacuation of 8,000 people. This was the 10th such eruption of the volcano in the preceding 12 months, and the first of 2010. Colombian authorities also stated that it could remain volatile in the weeks to come.

Galeras erupted again on August 25, 2010 with an ash plume visible in the air. The eruption, which was described as non-explosive, caused authorities to raise an alert for neighbouring towns.

This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.

<text>Voluntari () is a town in Ilfov County, Muntenia, Romania. It is located at a distance of 1 km from the northern border of Bucharest (on the DN2 road towards Urziceni) and is thus frequently viewed as a suburb of Bucharest.

The population is 47,366 inhabitants according to the 1 December 2021 census, with an ethnic composition, among those for whom data are available, of 94.8% Romanians, 1.3% Romani, 0.9% Chinese, 0.5% Turks, and 2.5% of other ethnic groups.

The low price of land, the proximity to Bucharest, and the easy and reliable access to both the railway network and the road network have allowed a steady development of industrial and commercial facilities, especially in the light industry and import/export commerce. The town&#x27;s output estimate increased by over 25% between 2001 and 2005. Even with such high development rates, many residents commute to Bucharest. Voluntari is the site of a shopping centre known as Jolie Ville Galleria, as well as the headquarters of the Vodafone Romania company.

Voluntari literally means &quot;Volunteers&quot;, in Romanian, having been founded by the volunteer soldiers who fought for Romania in World War I and were given plots to build their homes there after the war. The settlement received city status in 2004.

==Local government==

The Voluntari Local Council (&quot;Consiliul Local Voluntari&quot;) has 19 councillors. It currently has the following party composition:

==Transport==
Voluntari has its own bus network, operated by the local council, consisting of five bus routes: 1, 2, 153, 155 and 167. Additionally, the city is connected to Bucharest by bus routes run by STB, Bucharest&#x27;s public transport operator.

==Sport==
*FC Voluntari – football club

==Education== 
Voluntari is the site of the American International School of Bucharest, the British School of Bucharest and the Japanese School in Bucharest.

<doc id="1239627" wikidata="Q1815458" url="?curid=1239627" title="Two for the Seesaw (film)">
<text>Two for the Seesaw is a 1962 American romantic-drama film directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLaine. It was adapted from the 1958 Broadway play written by William Gibson with Henry Fonda and Anne Bancroft (who was awarded the 1958 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play) in the lead roles.

==Plot==
Jerry Ryan (Mitchum) is a lawyer from Nebraska who has recently separated from his wife Tess and has moved to a shabby apartment in New York. He is struggling with the divorce, which is still being finalized, and takes long walks at night.

At a party, he meets Gittel Mosca (MacLaine), a struggling dancer. They instantly get along, and begin to fall in love. But the relationship is hampered by their differences in background and temperament, and Jerry has difficulty separating himself emotionally from his wife.

Jerry gets a job with a New York law firm and prepares to take the bar examination. He helps Gittel rent a loft for a dance studio, which she rents out to other dancers, and they prepare to move in together.

Gittel becomes upset when she learns that Jerry&#x27;s divorce from Tess has been finalized and he did not tell her about it. Jerry explains that even though he is divorced from his ex-wife on paper, they remain bonded in many ways. Jerry and Gittel break up, and Jerry decides to return to Nebraska to make up with Tess. Later, Jerry calls Gittel to say goodbye and they admit that they love each other.

==Cast==
* Robert Mitchum as Jerry Ryan
* Shirley MacLaine as Gittel Mosca
* Edmon Ryan as Frank Taubman
* Elisabeth Fraser as Sophie
* Eddie Firestone as Oscar
* Billy Gray as Mister Jacoby

==Production==
The play was acquired by Seven Arts Productions for $350,000 plus a percentage of its earning. Another account said the purchase price was $600,000.

Elizabeth Taylor was signed to star with the possibility of Gregory Peck co-starring. Later, Paul Newman was slated to star opposite Taylor in the film but when Taylor was forced to drop out because of shooting overruns on &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Newman was free to take the role of &#x27;Fast Eddie&#x27; Felson in &quot;The Hustler&quot;.

&quot;Second Chance&quot;, the title tune, became a pop music and jazz standard, recorded by Ella Fitzgerald and other artists. At the 35th Academy Awards, the &quot;Song From Two for the Seesaw (Second Chance)&quot; from &quot;Two for the Seesaw&quot; – Music by André Previn; Lyric by Dory Langdon was nominated for Best Original Song but lost to &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. The movie was also nominated for Best Cinematography, Black and White (Ted D. McCord). However, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz) triumphed over it.

MacLaine later claimed that she and Mitchum began a relationship during the filming of this film that lasted three years.

The film was due to be shot over 60 days at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio in West Hollywood, California plus location shooting in New York.

<doc id="1239635" wikidata="Q578786" url="?curid=1239635" title="Thoracic vertebrae">
<text>In vertebrates, thoracic vertebrae compose the middle segment of the vertebral column, between the cervical vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae. In humans, there are twelve thoracic vertebrae of intermediate size between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae; they increase in size going towards the lumbar vertebrae. They are distinguished by the presence of facets on the sides of the bodies for articulation with the heads of the ribs, as well as facets on the transverse processes of all, except the eleventh and twelfth, for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. By convention, the human thoracic vertebrae are numbered T1–T12, with the first one (T1) located closest to the skull and the others going down the spine toward the lumbar region.

==General characteristics==

These are the general characteristics of the second through eighth thoracic vertebrae. The first and ninth through twelfth vertebrae contain certain peculiarities, and are detailed below.

The vertebral bodies in the middle of the thoracic region are heart-shaped and as broad in the anteroposterior as in the transverse direction. At the ends of the thoracic region they resemble respectively those of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae. They are slightly thicker behind than in front, flat above and below, convex from side to side in front, deeply concave behind, and slightly constricted laterally and in front. They present, on either side, two costal demi-facets, one above, near the root of the pedicle, the other below, in front of the inferior vertebral notch; these are covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and, when the vertebrae are articulated with one another, form, with the intervening intervertebral fibrocartilages, oval surfaces for the reception of the heads of the ribs.

The pedicles are directed backward and slightly upward, and the inferior vertebral notches are of large size, and deeper than in any other region of the vertebral column.

The laminae are broad, thick, and imbricated – that is to say, they overlap those of subjacent vertebrae like tiles on a roof and connect with the pedicles to surround and protect the spinal cord.

The intervertebral foramen is small, and circular, with two at each intervertebral level, one for the right and one for the left exiting nerve roots.

The vertebral foramen is the large opening posterior to the vertebral body also known as the &quot;spinal canal&quot;. It contains and protects the spinal cord at the thoracic level.

The spinous process is long, triangular on coronal section, directed obliquely downward, arising from the lamina and ending in a tuberculated extremity. These processes overlap from the fifth to the eighth, but are less oblique in direction above and below.

The superior articular processes are thin plates of bone projecting upward from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae; their articular facets are practically flat, and are directed backward and a little lateralward and upward.

The inferior articular processes are fused to a considerable extent with the laminae, and project slightly beyond their lower borders; their facets are directed proximally, medially, and inferiorly to the lamina.

The transverse processes arise from the arch behind the superior articular processes and pedicles; they are thick, strong, and of considerable length, directed obliquely backward and lateralward, and each ends in a clubbed extremity, on the front of which is a small, concave surface, for articulation with the tubercle of a rib.

==Individual thoracic vertebrae==
===First thoracic vertebra (T1)===
The first thoracic vertebra has, on either side of the body, an entire articular facet for the head of the first rib, and a demi-facet for the upper half of the head of the second rib.

The body is like that of a cervical vertebra, being broad, concave, and lipped on either side.

The superior articular surfaces are directed upward and backward; the spinous process is thick, long, and almost horizontal.

The transverse processes are long, and the upper vertebral notches are deeper than those of the other thoracic vertebrae.

The thoracic spinal nerve 1 (T1) passes inferior to it.

===Second thoracic vertebra (T2)===
The thoracic spinal nerve 2 (T2) passes inferior to it.
The second thoracic vertebra is larger than the first thoracic vertebra

===Third thoracic vertebra (T3)===
The thoracic spinal nerve 3 (T3) passes inferior to it.

===Fourth thoracic vertebra (T4)===
The fourth thoracic vertebra, together with the fifth, is at the same level as the sternal angle.

The thoracic spinal nerve 4 (T4) passes inferior it.

===Fifth thoracic vertebra (T5)===
The fifth thoracic vertebra, together with the fourth, is at the same level as the sternal angle. The human trachea divides into two main bronchi at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra, but may also end higher or lower, depending on breathing.

The thoracic spinal nerve 5 (T5) passes inferior to it.

===Sixth thoracic vertebra (T6)===
The thoracic spinal nerve 6 (T6) passes inferior to it.

===Seventh thoracic vertebra (T7)===
The thoracic spinal nerve 7 (T7) passes inferior to it.

===Eighth thoracic vertebra (T8)===
The eighth thoracic vertebra is, together with the ninth thoracic vertebra, at the same level as the xiphisternum.

The thoracic spinal nerve 8 (T8) passes inferior to it.

===Ninth thoracic vertebra (T9)===

The ninth thoracic vertebra may have no demi-facets below. In some subjects however, it has two demi-facets on either side; when this occurs the tenth doesn&#x27;t have facets but demi-facets at the upper part.

The thoracic spinal nerve 9 (T9) passes inferior to it.

The xiphisternum (or xiphoid process of the sternum) is at the same level in the axial plane.

===Tenth thoracic vertebra (T10)===

The tenth thoracic vertebra has an entire articular facet (not demi-facet) on either side, which is placed partly on the lateral surface of the pedicle. It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of facet below, because the following ribs only have one facet on their heads.

The thoracic spinal nerve 10 (T10) passes inferior to it.

===Eleventh thoracic vertebra (T11)===

In the eleventh thoracic vertebra the body approaches in its form and size to that of the lumbar vertebrae.

The articular facets for the heads of the ribs are of medium size, and placed chiefly on the pedicles, which are thicker and stronger in this and the next vertebra than in any other part of the thoracic region.

The spinous process is short, and nearly horizontal in direction.

The transverse processes are very short, tuberculated at their extremities, and do not have articular facets.

The thoracic spinal nerve 11 (T11) passes inferior to it.

===Twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12)===

The twelfth thoracic vertebra has the same general characteristics as the eleventh, but may be distinguished from it by its inferior articular surfaces being convex and directed lateralward, like those of the lumbar vertebrae; by the general form of the body, laminae, and spinous process, in which it resembles the lumbar vertebrae; and by each transverse process being subdivided into three elevations, the superior, inferior, and lateral tubercles: the superior and inferior correspond to the mammillary and accessory processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Traces of similar elevations are found on the transverse processes of the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae.

The thoracic spinal nerve 12 (T12) passes inferior to it.

==Other animals==

In other animals the number of thoracic vertebrae can vary greatly; for example, most marsupials have 13, but koalas have only 11. 12 to 15 is common among mammals, with 18 to 20 in horses, tapirs, rhinoceroses, and elephants, and extremes in mammals are marked by certain sloths with 25 and cetaceans with 9.

<text>Vilcabamba (in Hispanicized spelling) or Willkapampa (Aymara and Quechua), often called the Lost City of the Incas, is a lost city in the Echarate District of La Convención Province in the Cuzco Region of Peru. Vilcabamba, in Quechua, means &quot;sacred plain&quot;. The modern name for the Inca ruins of Vilcabamba is Espíritu Pampa (Plain of the Spirits).

Vilcabamba was the capital of the Neo-Inca State from 1539 to 1572. The Neo-Inca State was the last refuge of the Inca Empire until it fell to the Spaniards and their indigenous allies in 1572, signaling the end of Inca resistance to Spanish rule. Subsequently, Vilcabamba was abandoned and its location forgotten. In 1911 explorer Hiram Bingham mistakenly identified the abandoned ruin of Machu Picchu as Vilcabamba, but he also visited a ruin called Espiritu Pampa by local Peruvians. In 1964, Gene Savoy identified Espiritu Pampa as the fabled Vilcabamba, a designation widely accepted by archaeologists and historians.

Vilcabamba or Espiritu Pampa is located near the Chontabamba River, a tributary of the Urubamba River. The Inca capital has often been referred to as Vilcabamba the Old to distinguish it from the town of Vilcabamba the New, of Spanish origin and in straight-line distance southwest of Old Vilcabamba.

In 2010, items belonging to the Wari culture and radiocarbon dated to about 700 AD were found at Espiritu Pampa. This discovery indicated that the site was occupied long before it became the Inca capital in 1539. As of 2013, archaeological investigations of the site were incomplete and the ruins of Espiritu Pampa were inaccessible by vehicle.

== History ==
La Convención province in which Vilcabamba is located is extremely rugged, occupying the north-eastern slopes of the Andes and sloping down to the Amazon Basin. The terrain includes snow-covered mountains, forest, lowland jungle, and rivers running through deep canyons. Access and transportation within the area was difficult and would hinder Spanish efforts to destroy the last outposts of the Inca Empire.

The Incas had occupied the Vilcabamba region since about 1450 AD, establishing major centers at Machu Picchu, Choquequirao, Vitcos, and Vilcabamba. Thus, the Incas were familiar with the region when Inca emperor, Manco Inca Yupanqui, won the Battle of Ollantaytambo against the Spanish and their indigenous allies in January 1537. Despite the victory Manco was under intense pressure from the Spanish. He decided that Ollantaytambo was too close to Cusco, controlled by the Spanish, so he withdrew westward to the Inca center of Vitcos. Almagro sent his lieutenant Rodrigo Orgóñez in pursuit with 300 Spaniards and numerous indigenous allies. In July 1537, Orgoñez occupied and sacked Vitcos taking many prisoners, but Manco escaped.

Manco Inca survived another Spanish raid in 1539 by Gonzalo Pizarro, 300 Spanish soldiers, and indigenous allies. The Spanish and the Incas fought a battle at Huayna Pukara (Huayna Fort), west of Vitcos and about from Vilcabamba. Several Spaniards and indigenous enemies were killed, but Manco again escaped. Pizarro stayed in the region for more than two months searching for Manco unsuccessfully, but capturing Manco&#x27;s principal wife Cura Ocllo. The Spaniards wrote of the region that &quot;great resources are needed to undertake a penetration of that land. It can be done only with very heavy expenditure.&quot; The Spanish would not attempt another major military expedition into Vilcabamba until 1572. As the two Spanish raids demonstrated, Vitcos was accessible to the Spanish and Manco developed Vilcabamba as a more remote refuge.

In the years following the Spanish raids, the Incas and the Spaniards maintained uneasy diplomatic relations with visits back and forth between Vilcabamba and Cuzco, the Spanish capital. The murder of a Spanish envoy by the Incas persuaded Viceroy of Peru Francisco de Toledo to conquer the Vilcabamba region and end Inca rule. On June 24, 1572, a Spanish army, led by veteran conquistador Martin Hurtado de Arbieto, made a final advance on the Incas&#x27; remote jungle capital. &quot;At 10 o&#x27;clock,&quot; wrote Hurtado in his account of the campaign, &quot;they marched into the city of Vilcabamba, all on foot, for it is the most wild and rugged country, in no way suitable for horses.&quot; What they discovered was a city built &quot;for about a thousand fighting Indians, besides many other women, children, and old people&quot; filled with &quot;four hundred houses.&quot;

After the fall of Vilcabamba, the Spanish pursued and captured Túpac Amaru, the last Inca monarch, and beheaded him in Cusco on September 24, 1572.

=== Spanish Vilcabamba ===
In 1572, the conqueror and governor of Vilcabamba, Martin Hurtado de Arbieto, founded San Francisco de la Victoria de Vilcabamba, also known as Vilcabamba la Nueva (&quot;the New&quot;), west of Vitcos. It is located on the Pampaconas River, a tributary of the Vilcabamba River, which is a tributary of the Urubamba River. 
Hurtado was a brutal administrator, offering encomiendas to Spanish soldiers and making the local indigenous people virtual slaves. Many of them died, or abandoned their homes and fled elsewhere. Silver deposits were discovered nearby and the town enjoyed a brief boom, although the production of the mines was meager and by the early 17th century Vilcabamba the New and the Vilcabamba region was no longer of much interest to the Spanish. Hiram Bingham visited the town in 1911, noting that, &quot;Instead of Inca walls or ruins, Vilcabamba has three score solidly built Spanish houses...due to the prosperity of gold diggers, who came to work the quartz mines which were made accessible after the death of Tupac Amaru.&quot; Catholic clerics had built a church and a monastery in the town.

==The lost city==

The location of the Incan Vilcabamba was forgotten during the 17th century by the few remaining inhabitants of the region. In 1710, an explorer, Juan Arias Diaz, found Choquequirao, southwest of Vilcabamba, and identified it as the Incan capital. Later historians and explorers identified Choquequirao as Vilcabamba. In 1909, Peruvian historian, Carlos A. Romero, debunked the claim that Choquequirao was Incan Vilcabamba based on his studies of writings by Spanish chroniclers of the 16th century. Romero identified the village of Puquiura as the site of Incan Vilcabamba.

In 1911, Hiram Bingham was on the expedition which resulted in him bringing to a wider world attention the Incan ruin of Machu Picchu. Romero pointed him toward Puquiura as the site of Vilcabamba, and Bingham discovered there the ruins of Rosaspata. He correctly identified Rosaspata as the Incan Vitcos rather than Incan Vilcabamba. Drawn by rumors of another lost Inca ruin in the lowland forest, Bingham ignored tales of a hostile plantation owner and dangerous native peoples and proceeded onward. After a difficult three days of foot travel, he found the plantation. Its owner and the Asháninka or Campa indigenous peoples working there were friendly and helpful. They assisted him in cutting a trail through the jungle and two days later he found Inca ruins at a place called Espiritu Pampa. He found artificial terraces, stone houses, including a rectangular building long, a fountain, Inca pottery, and a stone bridge. But Bingham was running out of supplies and only spent a short time at Espiritu Pampa. Based on his brief observations, Bingham concluded that Machu Picchu was the Incan Vilcabamba. That opinion went largely unchallenged for 50 years. 
In 1964, Peruvian explorer Antonio Santander Caselli visited Espiritu Pampa and later claimed the discovery that Espiritu Pampa was the Incan Vilcabamba. In the same month, American explorer Gene Savoy reached Espiritu Pampa. He discovered that Bingham had only seen a minor part of the ruin at Eremboni Pampa and that the main ruin of Espiritu Pampa was distant. Savoy found 50 or 60 houses and 300 houses at Espiritu Pampa. Savoy concluded that Espiritu Pampa was Vilcabamba, contradicting Bingham. Savoy&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;Antisuyo&quot; brought the site to even wider attention.

Researcher and author John Hemming also concluded the Espiritu Pampa was Incan Vilcabamba in his 1970 book &quot;The Conquest of the Incas&quot;. He cited contemporary Spanish and Inca accounts of Vilcabamba as evidence. Titu Cusi Yupanqui said that Vilcambamba had a &quot;warm climate,&quot; unlike Vitcos which was in &quot;a cold district.&quot; This statement is consistent with the elevation of the two places: for Espiritu Pampa and for Vitcos. Moreover, both the conqueror of Vilcabamba, Hurtado de Abierto, and chronicler Martín de Murúa cited the tropical crops--coca, cotton, and sugar cane—grown near Vilcabamba and that the city lay in a &quot;hot country&quot; unlike most Inca cities. The Inca preferred to live in the high, cool climate of the Andes. Hurtado also described Vilcabamba as being in a valley with &quot;pastures for cattle,&quot; unlike Machu Picchu which is on a steep ridge. Finally, Hemming cited Spanish sources indicating that Vilcabamba was northwest of Vitcos—unlike Machu Picchu which is east of Vitcos. Thus, Bingham&#x27;s claim that Machu Picchu was Incan Vilcabamba and other claims that Vitcos was Vilcabamba were discredited.

In 1976, Professor Edmundo Guillén and Polish explorers Tony Halik and Elżbieta Dzikowska continued to explore the ruins at Espiritu Pampa. Before the expedition, Guillen visited a museum in Seville where he discovered letters from Spaniards, in which they described the progress of the invasion and what they found in Vilcabamba. Comparison between the letters&#x27; contents and the ruins provided additional proof of Espiritu Pampa as the location of Vilcabamba.

In 1981, the party of American explorer Gregory Deyermenjian reached and photographed parts of the site, soon thereafter generating a popular article concerning the site and its history.

Later extensive archeological work by Vincent Lee, and especially his exhaustive study, his 2000 book &quot;Forgotten Vilcabamba&quot;, gave further and even more precise confirmation that has made &quot;Espíritu Pampa&quot; the definitively accepted site of the historical Vilcabamba.

On 16 June 2006, a museum in Cuzco unveiled a plaque that commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of the 1976 Vilcabamba findings.

In 2011 the tomb of a king was discovered in Espíritu Pampa, which is estimated to date to the Wari period. The discovery testifies that the Vilcabamba site was inhabited since ancient times and that was almost certainly used as a center of commercial exchange between the people of the lowland jungle and the inhabitants of the Andean highlands.

== In popular culture ==
The lost city of Vilcabamba features as a location in the educational computer game series &quot;The Amazon Trail&quot;, the action-adventure video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and the role-playing video game &quot;Shadow Hearts: From the New World&quot;. It also appears in the books &quot;Evil Star&quot; and &quot;Necropolis&quot; by British thriller author Anthony Horowitz.

The city was the location of British writer Colin Thubron&#x27;s 2002 novel, &quot;To the Last City&quot;, which was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and tells the story of a group of people who set off to explore the ruins of the Inca city in what has been described as a &quot;Heart of Darkness narrative&quot; in a &quot;Marquezian setting&quot;.

The science fiction story &quot;Vilcabamba&quot; (2010) by Harry Turtledove is a self-referential allegory of Vilcabamba as an alien invasion story set in the 22nd century.

An episode of the TV Series &quot;In Search of...&quot; (1976-1982) titled &quot;Inca Treasures&quot;, highlights the expedition taken by professor Edmundo Guillén to explore the ruins of Vilcabamba.

The second episode of Michael Wood&#x27;s 2000 documentary series &quot;Conquistadors&quot; visits the site of Vilcabamba while telling the story of the fall of the Inca and retreat of Manco and his followers to the remote region as the last surviving remnant of the empire.

<text>Rudabeh Bakhtiar (, born 21 June 1966), better known as Rudi Bakhtiar, is an Iranian-American journalist and television producer. She is a producer for Reuters in Washington, D.C. She is best known for anchoring &quot;CNN Headline News Tonight&quot;, as well as &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;, Voice of America, and Reuters News.

==Early life and education==
Bakhtiar was born on June 21, 1966, in Fresno, California, as Rudabeh Carleen Bakhtiar to Iranian immigrants of Bakhtiari heritage. Her father died of oropharyngeal cancer in 2005. Bakhtiar has a younger brother and younger sister. Shapour Bakhtiar is Rudi Bakhtiar&#x27;s father&#x27;s uncle, the last prime minister of Iran under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi; a great aunt of Bakhtiar&#x27;s was the Shah of Iran&#x27;s second wife (Soraya Esfandiary). Bakhtiar&#x27;s great-grandfather is named Sardar Jang.

By age two, her family moved from Fresno to Los Angeles. When she was five, her family moved back to Iran, where she attended the American I.E.I. school in Shiraz until 1979 Iranian Revolution. Her family moved back to the United States when she was 17. She loved to ride horses as a child. Other hobbies include whitewater rafting, waterskiing, snow skiing, horseback riding, tennis, yoga, tae kwon do, and oil painting in her downtime.

She attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where she received a Bachelor of Science in biology in 1990, planning to be a dentist. She was accepted to New York University Dental School but had reservations about going to dental school. In addition, she studied architecture at the Career Discovery Program at the Harvard School of Design.

==Career==
In 1996, Bakhtiar joined CNN and held multiple positions in her nine years at the cable news network, including anchoring &quot;CNN Headline News Tonight&quot; on the CNN Headline News network. She has co-anchored CNN&#x27;s Emmy nominated &quot;CNN Newsroom&quot; and worked as a dedicated correspondent for &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;. She has reported on assignments from numerous countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, including Rwanda, Ethiopia, South Africa, Iran, Israel, and Palestine.

She also anchored the start of CNN&#x27;s Headline News coverage of the September 11 attacks. She had left CNN to care for her dying father after almost 10 years in cable news.

In January 2006, Bakhtiar joined Fox News Channel as a general correspondent, reporting on major international news stories such as the Ahmadinejad-al-Maliki summit in Tehran in September 2006 and the trial and execution of Saddam Hussein later that year. In 2007, Fox News terminated its contract with Bakhtiar after she made a complaint of alleged sexual harassment against then Fox Washington Bureau Chief, Brian Wilson.

In 2008, Bakhtiar switched careers to become the first public relations director for the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, an organization dedicated to building an inclusive and representative voice for Iranian Americans in the public and political arena. There she produced minidocumentaries called &quot;Profiles of Iranian Americans&quot; which focused on the lives of successful Iranian Americans. She also created and produced the organization&#x27;s signature star-studded community event &quot;Passing the Torch of Success,&quot; before being pushed out of the organization owing to her strong stance on Iran&#x27;s human rights violations.

In May 2011, Bakhtiar testified before the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Iran&#x27;s human rights crisis, claiming under the leadership of Ayatollah Khamenei &quot;Iran has become one of the worst violators of human rights in the world...egregiously violating virtually every article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a member state.&quot;

Bakhtiar worked on an unfinished documentary on Turkey after the failed 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt and before Michael Flynn was officially named National Security Advisor for President Donald Trump. A Turkish businessman had paid the Flynn Intel Group, a lobbying group in the United States, more than for the making of the film but he was adamant no one knew who they were. Bakhtiar complained she was not being given the opportunity to show a balanced view of the events and said the documentary was going to destroy Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish cleric whom Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blamed for the coup attempt and would like to see deported to Turkey from the U.S. In June 2017, Bakhtiar said she had not been contacted by people investigating Mr. Flynn, but by November 2017, it was reported that FBI agents investigating Flynn had contacted Bakhtiar.

==Personal life==
Bakhtiar is a fan of the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Lakers sports teams.

In 2009, she served as an official festival judge for the Noor Iranian Film Festival in Los Angeles.

==Recognition==
In 2002, Bakhtiar received the Iranian American Republican Council Achievement Award in recognition of outstanding achievements, excellence, and accomplishments within the Iranian American community. According to Lycos, she was ninth-ranked in the top 20 TV news personalities with the most searches from January through August that year.

In Washington D.C., December 4, 2003, Bakhtiar was the master of ceremonies for the Iranian American Technology Council Gala.

Bakhtiar was also the master of ceremonies for the University of California, Irvine, lecture given by Shirin Ebadi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, on May 21, 2005.

==Sexual harassment==
In 2007, Bakhtiar reported to Fox News about alleged sexual harassment by Brian Wilson before his promotion to Washington bureau chief. In public reports published in July 2016, Wilson denied harassing Bakhtiar.

When the matter was being addressed in 2007, Bakhtiar&#x27;s lawyer said that she had been unlawfully treated and terminated, citing a hostile environment of sexual harassment, quid pro quo sexual harassment, and retaliation. In response, Fox News refuted the allegations by stating that it could not be liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment even if her allegations against Wilson were true because he was not her supervisor at the time of the harassment. Fox News further stated that she could not prove a causal connection between her complaint and the termination of her contract. In 2007 her case went into confidential mediation, and Bakhtiar received a favorable ruling from the mediator. A settlement was reached in which Fox News agreed to pay Bakhtiar the $670,000 remaining on her contract, as well as her legal fees. Although she agreed in her settlement not to speak of her experience at Fox News, she decided to speak in the wake of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Gretchen Carlson against longtime Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in July 2016.

A scene showing Bakhtiar being harassed by Wilson is included in the 2019 film &quot;Bombshell&quot;, in which she is portrayed by Nazanin Boniadi.

<doc id="1239662" wikidata="Q318132" url="?curid=1239662" title="Mob Rules (band)">
<text>Mob Rules are a German power metal band. They were founded in 1994 by erstwhile Van Blanc guitarist Matthias Mineur and bassist Thorsten Plorin. Pulling in vocalist Klaus Dirks and drummer Arved Mannott, the quartet began to gig. Opening slots included shows with Pink Cream 69, C.I.T.A. and Crossroads.

During the spring of 1996, Mob Rules added second guitarist Oliver Fuhlhage and a self-financed mini album prompted a deal with Limb Music Productions for the March 1999 &quot;Savage Land&quot;. The reaction in Europe was encouraging and the band toured Germany on a co-headline jaunt with Ivory Tower. Other shows witnessed valuable support slots to Overkill and Scorpions as well as an appearance at the Wacken Open Air festival in 2000.

In 2000, the band released their second album &quot;Temple of Two Suns&quot;, Thomas Rettke of Heavens Gate and Susanne Möhle of Heavens Gate and Hyperchild providing backing vocals. Live work had the band crossing Europe in 2001 with Company of Snakes.

Mob Rules then returned to live action during July 2002 acting as support to Savatage, topping this activity off with an appearance at the Wacken Open Air festival. The band&#x27;s third album arrived in September 2002 &quot;Hollowed Be Thy Name&quot;. Guests include Peavy Wagner of Rage on the track &quot;How the Gypsy Was Born&quot; and ex-Helloween guitarist Roland Grapow on both &quot;All Above the Atmosphere&quot; and &quot;Way of the World&quot;.

&quot;Among the Gods&quot;, arrived in May 2004 through SPV. Guitarist Oliver Fuhlhage was replaced by Sven Lüdke of Murder One in October as the band geared up for European dates supporting Europe. The band recorded a live album and DVD, billed &quot;Signs of the Time LIVE&quot;, at a hometown gig at the Wilhelmshaven Pumpwerk.

In spring 2006 Markus Brinkmann replaced Thorsten Plorin. In October 2006 their album &quot;Ethnolution A.D.&quot; was released through SPV.

<text>Air Commodore Colin McKay Grierson CBE (16 June 19061991) was a senior officer in the Royal Air Force during and after World War II.

He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as an Aircraft Apprentice in 1921. In 1925 he became a Flight Cadet Sergeant. In 1927 he was on the staff of RAF Calshot with the rank of Pilot Officer. During the 1930s he held a number of different positions in the RAF as Armament and Engineering Officer. On 1 January 1941 he worked on the Air Staff in the Directorate of Plans.

On 20 May 1944 he became Assistant Chief of Staff A2 (Intelligence), Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) with the rank of Acting Air Commodore. At a press briefing two days after the Dresden raid on 14 February 1945, Grierson told journalists:

One of the journalists asked whether the principal aim of bombing of Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies. Grierson answered that the primary aim was communications to prevent them moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroying &quot;what is left of German morale&quot;. Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, subsequently filed a story saying that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. This set in train a number of embarrassing questions on both sides of the Atlantic on the morality of this form of attack.

He retired from the RAF on 31 August 1950 with the rank of Air Commodore.

<doc id="1239695" wikidata="Q7352431" url="?curid=1239695" title="Robin Gray (New Zealand politician)">
<text>Sir Robert McDowall Gray (2 July 1931 – 2 April 2022), generally known as Robin Gray, was a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1978 to 1996, and served as Speaker of the House of Representatives between 1990 and 1993.

==Early life and family==
Gray was born in Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland on 2 July 1931. He received his education at Borgue Primary School and at George Watson&#x27;s Boys College. After serving with the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards from 1949 to 1951 in Africa, he migrated to New Zealand in 1952 to take up farming, initially working on a farm at Tapanui, before moving to his own property at Waitahuna, Central Otago. Gray became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1973.

Gray married Mary Muir Thomson in 1957. She was the daughter of Alexander Thomson. The couple went on to have three children. Gray was widowed by the death of his wife, Mary, in 1981.

==Member of Parliament==


He joined the National Party in 1956, and held a number of positions in its internal hierarchy. In the 1978 election, he was elected to replace Peter Gordon as MP for Clutha, a safe National seat that practically guaranteed election. He was elected in 1978 and held the electorate until the 1996 election, when it was abolished and he retired.

Gray became the National Party&#x27;s Junior Whip in 1985 and the Senior Whip in 1987.

===Speaker of the House of Representatives===
When National won office in the 1990 election, Gray was made Speaker of the House of Representatives. After the 1993 election, however, the National Party saw its majority pared back to a single seat. As the Speaker could only vote in the event of a tie, re-appointing Gray to the Speakership would leave Parliament deadlocked. National therefore offered the Speakership to Peter Tapsell of the Labour Party. Gray was appointed to the sinecure of Minister of State, and also became Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In the 1994 New Year Honours, Gray was appointed a Knight Bachelor.

As Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gray was entitled to the title of The Honourable, and he was granted use of the honorific for the rest of his life in 1994.

==Life after Parliament==
After stepping down as an MP, Gray retired to Mosgiel, but continued to make occasional appearances and commentary at various conferences around New Zealand. He was mildly critical of the National Party for failing to promote members&#x27; interests at conferences, to which he achieved a degree of success in ensuring delegates had more opportunity for engagement at the formal meetings.

Gray was the founding president on the board of trustees for the New Zealand Business and Parliament Trust. He died at his home in Mosgiel on 2 April 2022.

==Freemason==
Gray was active as a Freemason from the 1950s. He was initiated at Kirkcudbright the day before he left for New Zealand. He joined the lodge at Tapanui after arriving in New Zealand, before transferring to Lawrence in 195, where he rose to become master in 1971. After retiring from farming, he transferred to Lodge St John 84 in Mosgiel in 1995, and was appointed grand lecturer the following year.

<doc id="1239701" wikidata="Q4825132" url="?curid=1239701" title="1967 Australian referendum (Aboriginals)">
<text>The second question of the 1967 Australian referendum of 27 May 1967, called by the Holt government, related to Indigenous Australians. Voters were asked whether to give the Commonwealth Parliament the power to make special laws for Indigenous Australians, and whether Indigenous Australians should be included in official population counts for constitutional purposes. The term &quot;the Aboriginal Race&quot; was used in the question.

Technically the referendum question was a vote on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) 1967 that would amend section 51(xxvi) and repeal section 127.

The amendments to the Constitution were overwhelmingly endorsed, winning 90.77% of votes cast and having majority support in all six states. The amendment became law on 10 August 1967.

==Background==
In 1901, the attorney-general, Alfred Deakin, provided a legal opinion on the meaning of section 127 of the Constitution of Australia. Section 127 excluded &quot;aboriginal natives&quot; from being counted when reckoning the numbers of the people of the commonwealth or a state. His legal advice was that &quot;half-castes&quot; were not &quot;aboriginal natives&quot;.

Prior to 1967, censuses asked a question about Aboriginal race to establish numbers of &quot;half-castes&quot; and &quot;full-bloods&quot;. &quot;Full-bloods&quot; were then subtracted from the official population figure in accordance with the legal advice from the attorney-general.

Strong activism by individuals and both Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups greatly aided the success of the 1967 referendum in the years leading up to the vote. Calls for Aboriginal issues to be dealt with at the federal level began as early as 1910. Despite a failed attempt in the 1944 referendum, minimal changes were instigated for Aboriginal rights until the 1960s, where the Bark Petition in 1963 and the ensuing &quot;Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd and Commonwealth of Australia&quot; (Gove Land Rights Case), and Gurindji Strike highlighted the negative treatment of Indigenous workers in the Northern Territory. From here, the overall plight of Aboriginal Australians became a fundamental political issue.

On 7 April 1965, the Menzies Cabinet decided that it would seek to repeal section 127 of the Constitution at the same time as it sought to amend the nexus provision, but made no firm plans or timetable for such action. In August 1965, attorney-general Billy Snedden proposed to Cabinet that abolition of section 127 was inappropriate unless section 51(xxvi) was simultaneously amended to remove the words &quot;other than the aboriginal race in any state&quot;. He was rebuffed, but gained agreement when he made a similar submission to the Holt Cabinet in 1966. In the meantime, his Liberal colleague Billy Wentworth had introduced a private member&#x27;s bill proposing &quot;inter alia&quot; to amend section 51(xxvi).

In 1964, the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Calwell, had proposed such a change and pledged that his party, the Australian Labor Party, would back any referendum to that effect.

In 1967, the Australian Parliament was unanimous in voting for the alteration bill.

The Australian Board of Missions, the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, the Australian Aborigines League, the Australian Council of Churches, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) and spokespeople such as Ruby Hammond, Bill Onus and Faith Bandler were some of the many groups and individuals who effectively utilised the media and their influential platforms to generate the momentum needed to achieve a landslide Yes vote.

==Amendments to the Constitution==
Voters were asked to approve, together, changes to two provisions in the Constitution section 51(xxvi) and section 127.

Section 51 begins:

And the extraordinary clauses that follow (ordinarily referred to as heads of power) list most of the legislative powers of the federal parliament. The amendment deleted the text in bold from subsection xxvi (known as the &quot;race&quot; or &quot;races&quot; power):

The amendment gave the Commonwealth parliament power to make &quot;special laws&quot; with respect to Aboriginal People living in a state; the parliament already had unfettered power in regard to territories under section 122 of the Constitution. It was the intention of the government and many voters that this new power was to be only used beneficially. However in the case of &quot;Kartinyeri v Commonwealth&quot;, the High Court did not find that such a restriction on the power existed, with the court being split 2:2 (2 judges not deciding) as to whether or not the power could be used to the &quot;detriment&quot; of an identified race. The Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy, and the Northern Territory Intervention are two circumstances where the post-1967 race power has arguably been used in this way.

Section 127 was wholly removed. Headed &quot;Aborigines not to be counted in reckoning population&quot;, it had read:

The Constitution required the calculation of &quot;the people&quot; for several purposes in sections 24, 89, 93 and 105. Section 89 related to the imposition of uniform customs duties and operated until 1901. Section 93 related to uniform custom duties after being imposed by section 89 and operated until 1908. Section 105 related to taking over state debts and was superseded by section 105A inserted in the Constitution in 1929 following the 1928 referendum. Accordingly, in 1967, only section 24 in relation to the House of Representatives had any operational importance to section 127. 

Section 24 &quot;requires the membership of the House of Representatives to be distributed among the States in proportion to the respective numbers of their people&quot;. The number of people in section 24 is calculated using the latest statistics of the Commonwealth which are derived from the census. Section 51(xi) of the Constitution enabled the Parliament to make laws for &quot;census and statistics&quot; and it exercised that power to pass the &quot;Census and Statistics Act 1905&quot;.

==What the referendum did not do==

===Give voting rights===

It is frequently stated that the 1967 referendum gave Aboriginal people Australian citizenship and that it gave them the right to vote in federal elections; however, this was not the case. 

From 1944, Aboriginal people in Western Australia could apply to become citizens of the state, which gave them various rights, including the right to vote. This citizenship was conditional on adopting &quot;the manner and habits of civilised life&quot; and not associating with Aboriginal people other than their parents, siblings, children, or grandchildren, and could be taken away at any time. This situation continued until 1971. Most Indigenous Australians continued to be denied the right to vote in elections for the Australian Parliament even after 1949. The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1949&quot; gave Aboriginal people the right to vote in federal elections only if they were able to vote in their state elections (they were disqualified from voting altogether in Queensland, while in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory the right was conditional), or if they had served in the defence force. 

The &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962&quot; gave all Aboriginal people the option of enrolling to vote in federal elections. It was not until the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 1983&quot; that voting became compulsory for Aboriginal people, as it was for other Australians.

Aboriginal people (and all other people) living in the Northern Territory were not allowed to vote in the referendum, which remained the case for both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory until the Constitutional amendment to section 128 after a referendum in 1977.

===Supersede a &quot;Flora and Fauna Act&quot; ===

It is also sometimes mistakenly stated that the 1967 referendum overturned a Flora and Fauna Act. This is believed to have come from the New South Wales &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act&quot; 1974, which controlled Aboriginal heritage, land and culture. The other states had equivalent acts which were managed by various departments, including those relating to agriculture and fishing.

=== Right to be included in the census ===
Section 127 prevented the inclusion of the Indigenous Australians in the official population for constitutional purposes, i.e. their population would not be included in the calculation of the number of seats to assign for each state or in the determination of tax revenue. The section did not prevent the Bureau of Statistics from counting or collecting other information about Indigenous Australians. From 1911 to 1966 the Bureau had collected information about Indigenous Australians, however this was published separately to the general population. As such, while the inclusion in the general population was important symbolically, the change did not directly improve the information available to government.

==Question==
==Results==


== Legacy ==

Ninety percent of voters voted yes, and the overwhelming support gave the Federal Government a clear mandate to implement policies to benefit Aboriginal people. Many misconceptions have arisen as to the outcomes of the referendum, some as a result of it taking on a symbolic meaning during a period of increasing Aboriginal self-confidence. It was some five years before any real change occurred as a result of the referendum, but federal legislation has since been enacted covering land rights, discriminatory practices, financial assistance, and preservation of cultural heritage.

The referendum result had two main outcomes:
* The first was to alter the legal boundaries within which the Federal Government could act. The Federal Parliament was given a constitutional head-of-power under which it could make special laws &quot;for&quot; Aboriginal people (for their benefit or, as the High Court has made clear, their detriment) in addition to other &quot;races&quot;. The Australian Constitution states that federal law prevails over state law, where they are inconsistent, so that the Federal Parliament could, if it so chose, enact legislation that would end discrimination against Aboriginal people by state governments. However, during the first five years following the referendum the Federal Government did not use this new power.
*The other key outcome of the referendum was to provide Aboriginal people with a symbol of their political and moral rights. The referendum occurred at a time when Aboriginal activism was accelerating, and it was used as a kind of historical shorthand for all the relevant political events of the time, such as the demands for land rights by the Gurindji people, the equal-pay case for pastoral workers, and the Freedom Rides to end segregation in New South Wales. This use as a symbol for a period of activism and change has contributed to the misconceptions about the effects of the constitutional changes themselves.

===Symbolic effect===
The 1967 referendum has acquired a symbolic meaning in relation to a period of rapid social change during the 1960s. As a result, it has been credited with initiating political and social change that was the result of other factors. The real legislative and political impact of the 1967 referendum has been to enable, and thereby compel, the federal government to take action in the area of Aboriginal Affairs. Federal governments with a broader national and international agenda have attempted to end the discriminatory practices of state governments such as Queensland and to introduce policies that encourage self-determination and financial security for Aboriginal people. However, the effectiveness of these policies has been tempered by an unwillingness of most federal governments to deal with the difficult issues involved in tackling recalcitrant state governments. It has been argued that Holt, who died not long after the referendum, was setting up a more extensive government response than Gorton enacted.

===Land rights===

The benefits of the referendum began to flow to Aboriginal people in 1972. On 26 January 1972, Aboriginal peoples erected the &quot;Aboriginal Tent Embassy&quot; on the lawns of the Federal Parliament building in Canberra to express their frustration at the lack of progress on land rights and racial discrimination issues. This became a major confrontation that raised Aboriginal affairs high on the political agenda in the federal election later that year. One week after gaining office, the Whitlam government (1972–1975) established a Royal Commission into land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. Its principal recommendations, delivered in May 1974, were: that Aboriginal people should have inalienable title to reserve lands; that regional land councils should be established; to establish a fund to purchase land with which Aboriginal people had a traditional connection, or that would provide economic or other benefits; prospecting and mineral exploration on Aboriginal land should only occur with their consent (or that of the Federal Government if the national interest required it); entry onto Aboriginal land should require a permit issued by the regional land council. The recommendations were framed in terms to enable application outside the Northern Territory. The Federal Government agreed to implement the principal recommendations, and in 1975, the House of Representatives passed the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill, but the Senate had not considered them by the time parliament was dissolved in 1975.

The following year, the Fraser government (1975–1983) amended the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill by introducing the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. The new bill made a number of significant changes such as limitation on the operations and boundaries of land councils; giving Northern Territory law effect on Aboriginal land, thereby enabling land rights to be eroded; removing the power of land councils to issue permits to non-Aboriginal people; and allowing public roads to be built on Aboriginal land without consent. This bill was passed as the &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976&quot;. It is significant however that this legislation was implemented at all, given the political allegiances of the Fraser government, and shows the level of community support for social justice for Aboriginal people at the time.

===Use of &quot;race power&quot; in legislation===
The Whitlam government used its constitutional powers to overrule racially discriminatory state legislation. On reserves in Queensland, Aboriginal people were forbidden to gamble, use foul language, undertake traditional cultural practices, indulge in adultery, or drink alcohol. They were also required to work without payment. In the Aboriginal Courts in Queensland the same official acted as judge as well as the prosecuting counsel. Defendants almost invariably pleaded guilty as pleas of not guilty were more than likely to lead to a longer sentence. The Whitlam government, using the race power, enacted the &quot;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975&quot; to override the state laws and eliminate racial discrimination against Aboriginal people. However, no federal government ever enforced this Act.

The race power was also used by the Whitlam government to positively discriminate in favour of Aboriginal people. It established schemes whereby Aboriginal people could obtain housing, loans, emergency accommodation and tertiary education allowances. It also increased funding for the Aboriginal Legal Service enabling twenty-five offices to be established throughout Australia.

The race power gained in the 1967 referendum has been used in several other pieces of significant Federal legislation. One of the pieces of legislation enacted to protect the Gordon River catchment used the race power but applied it to all people in Australia. The law prohibited anyone from damaging sites, relics and artefacts of Aboriginal settlement in the Gordon River catchment. In the Tasmanian Dam Case, the High Court held that even though this law applied to all people and not only to Aboriginal people, it still constituted a special law.

In the 1992 Mabo judgment, the High Court of Australia established the existence of Native Title in Australian Common Law. Using the race power, the Keating Government enacted the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; and successfully defended a High Court challenge from the Queensland Government.

=== Blame Shifting ===
In granting the Commonwealth a broad power to legislate in regards to Indigenous Australians, responsibilities for areas traditionally the purview of the states (such as housing, education and healthcare) was shared between both branches of government. As a result, both levels have sought to blame the other for the continuing disadvantage of Indigenous Australians, while seeking to place the cost and responsibility to manage these issues on the other. Additionally, the disillusion in the face of continuing discrimination despite the overwhelming success of the vote led to a new generation of Indigenous activists, who placed a greater emphasis on their rights as First Peoples as seen through the establishment of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, the focus on sovereignty and land rights.

=== Negative application of &quot;race power&quot; ===
When John Howard&#x27;s Coalition government came to power in 1996, it intervened in the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy in South Australia with legislation that introduced an exception to the &quot;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984&quot;, to allow the bridge to proceed. The Ngarrindjeri challenged the new legislation in the High Court on the basis that it was discriminatory to declare that the &quot;Heritage Protection Act&quot; applied to sites everywhere but Hindmarsh Island, and that such discrimination – essentially on the basis of race – had been disallowed since the Commonwealth was granted the power to make laws with respect to the &quot;Aboriginal race&quot; as a result of the 1967 Referendum. The High Court decided, by a majority, that the amended s.51(xxvi) of the Constitution still did not restrict the Commonwealth parliament to making laws solely for the benefit of any particular race, but still empowered the parliament to make laws that were to the detriment of any race. This decision effectively meant that those people who had believed that they were casting a vote against negative discrimination towards Indigenous people in 1967 had, in fact, allowed the Commonwealth to participate in the discrimination against Indigenous people which had been practised by the States.

<text>In molecular physics, the Pariser–Parr–Pople method applies semi-empirical quantum mechanical methods to the quantitative prediction of electronic structures and spectra, in molecules of interest in the field of organic chemistry. Previous methods existed—such as the Hückel method which led to Hückel&#x27;s rule—but were limited in their scope, application and complexity, as is the Extended Hückel method.

This approach was developed in the 1950s by Rudolph Pariser with Robert Parr and co-developed by John Pople.
 It is essentially a more efficient method of finding reasonable approximations of molecular orbitals, useful in predicting physical and chemical nature of the molecule under study since molecular orbital characteristics have implications with regards to both the basic structure and reactivity of a molecule. This method used the zero-differential overlap (ZDO) approximation to reduce the problem to reasonable size and complexity but still required modern solid state computers (as opposed to punched card or vacuum tube systems) before becoming fully useful for molecules larger than benzene.

Originally, Pariser&#x27;s goal of using this method was to predict the characteristics of complex organic dyes, but this was never realized. The method has wide applicability in precise prediction of electronic transitions, particularly lower singlet transitions, and found wide application in theoretical and applied quantum chemistry. The two basic papers on this subject were among the top five chemistry and physics citations reported in ISI, Current Contents 1977 for the period of 1961–1977 with a total of 2450 references.

In contrast to the Hartree–Fock-based semiempirical method counterparts (i.e.: MOPAC), the pi-electron theories have a very strong ab initio basis. The PPP formulation is actually an approximate pi-electron effective operator, and the empirical parameters, in fact, include effective electron correlation effects. A rigorous, ab initio theory of the PPP method is provided by diagrammatic, multi-reference, high order perturbation theory (Freed, Brandow, Lindgren, etc.). (The exact formulation is non-trivial, and requires some field theory) Large scale ab initio calculations (Martin and Birge, Martin and Freed, Sheppard and Freed, etc.) have confirmed many of the approximations of the PPP model and explain why the PPP-like models work so well with such a simple formulation.

<doc id="1239729" wikidata="Q1361740" url="?curid=1239729" title="Endless knot">
<text>The endless knot or eternal knot is a symbolic knot and one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols. It is an important symbol in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. It is an important cultural marker in places significantly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism such as Tibet, Mongolia, Tuva, Kalmykia, and Buryatia. It is also found in Celtic, Kazakh and Chinese symbolism.

== History ==
The endless knot appears on clay tablets from the Indus Valley civilization (2500 BC) and on a historic era inscription. While associated with Dharmic religions, it also appears in Islamic art. It likely was introduced due to trade and other cultural contact with China, the Mongols, and Iran.

== Interpretations ==

===Buddhism===
Various Buddhist interpretations of the symbol are:

* The endless knot iconography symbolised Samsara &quot;i.e.&quot;, the endless cycle of suffering of birth, death and rebirth within Tibetan Buddhism.
* The inter-twining of wisdom and compassion.
* Interplay and interaction of the opposing forces in the dualistic world of manifestation, leading to their union, and ultimately to harmony in the universe.
* The mutual dependence of religious doctrine and secular affairs.
* The union of wisdom and method.
* The inseparability of emptiness (shunyata) and dependent origination, the underlying reality of existence.
* The link between ancestors and omnipresence represented by the etymology of Tantra, Yoga and religion) (see Namkha.)
* The wisdom of the Buddha as neither are said to have a beginning or end.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, Srivatsa is mentioned as &#x27;connected to shree&#x27;, i.e the goddess Lakshmi. It is a mark on the chest of Vishnu where his consort Lakshmi resides. According to the Vishnu purana, the tenth avatar of Vishnu, Kalki, will bear the Shrivatsa mark on his chest. It is one of the names of Vishnu in the Vishnu Sahasranamam. Srivatsa is considered to be auspicious symbol in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

===Jainism===
In Jainism it is one of the eight auspicious items, an asthamangala, however found only in the Svetambara sect. It is often found marking the chests of the 24 tirthankaras. It is more commonly referred to as the Shrivatsa.

<text>Richard John Northey (born 28 April 1945) is a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1990, and again from 1993 to 1996. He served on the Auckland Council between 2010 and 2013, and is a member of the Labour Party.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Northey was born in Hamilton in 1945 and was educated at Auckland Grammar School. He then attended the University of Auckland where he obtained a Bachelor of Science in chemistry and physics and a first class Master of Arts in political science.

He then found employment as a youth and recreation officer, arts advisor and employment officer. He became president of the New Zealand Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and served on the committee of the New Zealand Consultative Committee on Disarmament. He was also an executive member of the Auckland District Council of Social Service and Citizens&#x27; Advocacy and the president of the Citizens Association for Racial Equality (CARE).

He joined the Labour Party and became chairman of Princes Street Labour as well as the Eden Central and Orakei branches. Later he was chair of the Tamaki and Eden electorate committees. Northey also was the vice-president, and later president, of the Auckland Labour Regional Council and was a member of Labour&#x27;s national executive as a youth representative.

===Local body politics===
Northey first stood as a Labour Party candidate for the Auckland City Council at the 1968 local elections. He stood for the council unsuccessfully four times before finally winning a seat at a by-election in February 1979. He lost his seat at the next election in 1980. After exiting the council Northey stood unsuccessfully for Parliament against the then Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, in the Tamaki electorate in the 1981 election. In the 1983 local elections Northey regained a seat on the city council before deciding not to stand for re-election in 1986.

===Member of Parliament===


He was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election as MP for Eden, replacing National&#x27;s Aussie Malcolm. He was re-elected in the 1987 election, but was defeated in the National Party&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1990 election. During this time he was chair of the Auckland Labour MPs Lobby. In 1986 Northey led the New Zealand government&#x27;s youth delegation to China, attended the inter-parliamentary union conference in Bangkok in 1987 and was a delegate at the first parliamentary conference on the global environment in Washington in 1990. In September 1990 he stood for the Labour Party leadership against Foreign Affairs Minister Mike Moore. His candidature was a surprise to most given that he was not a member of cabinet. He was defeated by Moore by the wide margin of 41 votes to 15.

After losing his seat in 1990, he attempted to regain a seat on the Auckland City Council. He stood as a candidate in a 1991 by-election for the Maungakiekie Ward, finishing runner-up to Ken Graham.

In the 1993 election he returned to Parliament, now representing Onehunga which he took off National&#x27;s Grahame Thorne. He was selected as the Labour candidate in Onehunga in preference to Chris Diack, a supporter of controversial former finance minister Roger Douglas. After missing out on the nomination Diack and his allies in the branch drained the electorate cash accounts by lump paying more than $6000 in outstanding debts to party headquarters, leaving just $7 to fund Northey&#x27;s campaign in an act of spite. They then took ownership of an income-earning rental house from the Onehunga Labour Party and used it to instead fund the ACT Party (to whom Diack defected to in 1994) before finally being returned to the Labour Party after a long legal case in 2004.

After re-entering Parliament Northey was aligned to Helen Clark who replaced Moore as leader. Clark appointed him Labour&#x27;s Shadow Minister of Local Government and Youth Affairs. In a 1995 reshuffle he was also given the disarmament and arms control portfolio. In the 1996 election he contested the Maungakiekie seat after boundary changes caused by the introduction of mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, but was defeated in an upset by National&#x27;s Belinda Vernon. He was not ranked high enough on Labour&#x27;s list to remain in Parliament.

In June 2020 it was revealed that the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service had spied upon Northey during his time in Parliament, under the pretext of his support for racial equality and nuclear disarmament. At the time he was chair of the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee, which was responsible for financial oversight of the SIS, and of legislation altering its powers.

===Return to local politics===

He has since entered local politics, serving on the Auckland City Council holding senior committee roles. He was elected to the Penrose Ward in 1998 until 2001 when he changed to the Maungakiekie-Tamaki Ward, holding his seat until the council was abolished in 2010. In 2007, Richard Northey became leader of the City Vision-Labour bloc on council.

Northey became a member of Labour&#x27;s national council for six years and was chairman of the party&#x27;s policy committee. In 2000 he stood unsuccessfully to replace Bob Harvey as President of the Labour Party, but was defeated by Mike Williams.

He was elected to the new Auckland Council in 2010, representing the Maungakiekie-Tāmaki Ward.
In 2013 he contested the Maungakiekie-Tāmaki Ward again but was defeated by Denise Krum.

At the 2016 Auckland elections, Northey was elected as a member of the Waitematā Local Board for the City Vision ticket. He was re-elected in the 2019 Auckland local elections, and was subsequently elected Chair of the Local Board.

==Personal life==

He was a lecturer in political studies and planning at the University of Auckland. In the 2002 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services.

<doc id="1239736" wikidata="Q2484240" url="?curid=1239736" title="Battle of Vertières">
<text>The Battle of Vertières () was the last major battle of the Haitian Revolution, and the final part of the Revolution under Jean Jacques Dessalines. It was fought on 18 November 1803 between the enslaved Haitian army and Napoleon&#x27;s French expeditionary forces, who were committed to regaining control of the island.

Vertières is situated just south of Cap-Haïtien (known then as Cap-Français), in the Département du Nord, Haiti. By the end of October 1803, the forces fighting the expeditionary troops had already taken over most of the territory of St. Domingue. The only places controlled by the French forces were Môle St. Nicolas, held by Noailles, and Cap-Français, where, with 5,000 troops, French General Rochambeau was at bay.

== Background ==

In 1802, the revolutionary leader Toussaint Louverture was captured by Napoleon&#x27;s troops. From the ship that would lead him to his prison cell, and eventual death, Louverture said: “In overthrowing me, you have done no more than cut down the trunk of the tree of black liberty in St. Domingue. It will spring back from the roots, for they are numerous and deep.” After L&#x27;Ouverture’s death, Jean Jacques Dessalines continued the fight for liberty by leading the resistance to the French.

== Battle ==

Dessalines defeated the French army numerous times before the battle of Vertières. During the night of 17–18 November 1803, the Haitians positioned their few guns to blast Fort Bréda, located on the &quot;habitation&quot; where Louverture had worked as a coachman under François Capois. As the French trumpets sounded the alarm, Clervaux, a Haitian rebel, fired the first shot. Capois, mounted on a great horse, led his Haitian demi-brigade forward despite storms of bullets from the forts on his left. The approach to Charrier ran up a long ravine under the guns of Vertières. French fire killed a number of soldiers in the Haitian columns, but the soldiers closed ranks and clambered past their dead, singing. Capois&#x27; horse was shot, faltered and fell, tossing Capois off his saddle. Capois picked himself up, drew his sword; brandished it over his head and ran onwards shouting: &quot;Forward! Forward!&quot; (En avant! En avant!).

Rochambeau was watching from the rampart of Vertières. As Capois charged forth, the French drums rolled a sudden cease-fire. Suddenly, the battle stopped. A French staff officer mounted his horse and rode toward the intrepid Capois-la-Mort (&quot;Capois-the-Death&quot;). With a loud voice, he shouted: &quot;General Rochambeau sends compliments to the general who has just covered himself with such glory!&quot; Then he saluted the Haitian warriors, returned to his position, and the fighting resumed.

General Dessalines sent his reserves under Gabart, the youngest of the generals, while Jean-Philippe Daut, Rochambeau’s guard of grenadiers, formed for a final charge. But Gabart, Capois, and Clervaux, the last fighting with a French musket in hand and with one epaulette shot away, repulsed the desperate counterattack.

A sudden downpour with thunder and lightning drenched the battlefield. Under cover of the storm, Rochambeau pulled back from Vertières, knowing he was defeated and that Saint-Domingue was lost for France.

== Aftermath ==
The next morning, general Rochambeau sent Duveyrier to negotiate with Dessalines. By the end of the day, the terms of the French surrender were settled. Rochambeau got ten days to embark the remainder of his army and leave Saint-Domingue. The wounded French soldiers were left behind under lock and key with the expectation that they would be returned to France, but they were drowned a few days later.

This battle occurred less than two months before Dessalines&#x27; proclamation of the independent Republic of Haiti on 1 January 1804.
During the Second Restoration, the kingdom of France refused to recognize the independence acquired against the French Republic. In 1826, King Charles X demanded that Haiti pay a compensation of 150 million gold francs before France would recognize the young republic&#x27;s independence. In 1838, under the July Monarchy, this debt was reduced by King Louis-Philippe to 90 million francs and was paid to France until well into the 1900’s. 

November 18 has been widely celebrated since then as a Day of Victory in Haiti.

<doc id="1239743" wikidata="Q547503" url="?curid=1239743" title="SIAI-Marchetti">
<text>SIAI-Marchetti was an Italian aircraft manufacturer primarily active during the interwar period.

==History==
The original company was founded during 1915 as SIAI (&quot;Società Idrovolanti Alta Italia&quot; – Seaplane Company of Upper Italy). As suggested by its name, the firm initially specialised in the manufacture of seaplanes, the vast majority of which were intended for the Italian armed forces. Perhaps its most prominent early aircraft was the SIAI S.16, a seaplane that had been configured to perform both aerial reconnaissance and bomber roles, but also proved itself quite capable of long-distance flights. During 1925, Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian Royal Air Force) used an SIAI S.16&quot;ter&quot; he named &quot;Genariello&quot; for a record-setting flight from Rome to Australia and Tokyo to demonstrate his idea that seaplanes were superior to landplanes for long-distance flights. Having departed Rome on 21 April, Pinedo and his mechanic, Ernesto Campanelli, visited dozens of countries, often stopping for multiple weeks at a time, particularly in Australia, before successfully arriving in Tokyo on 26 September 1925.

Shortly following the end of the First World War, the company was rebranded as Savoia following its acquisition of the &quot;Società Anonima Costruzioni Aeronautiche Savoia&quot;, an Italian aircraft company founded by Umberto Savoia in 1915. The name Marchetti was added to the company&#x27;s name shortly following the recruitment of its long-serving chief designer, Alessandro Marchetti, during 1922.

Savoia-Marchetti gained prominence with the innovative S.55 flying boat. During 1926, the S.55P prototype successfully established 14 separate world records in categories including speed, altitude, and distance with a payload. Production models were produced for both civilian and military export customers; numerous S.55s were used during the Second World War and for a number of years beyond the conflict, despite the arrival of many newer types.

Savoia-Marchetti became relatively well known for its flying boats and seaplanes, aided by the numerous endurance and speed records that had been set by its products. The company earned the favour of numerous Italian officials, including Air Marshal Italo Balbo. Accordingly, the company was involved in the rapid development and prototyping of a wide portfolio of aircraft types during the 1930s. One such aircraft was the SM.75 trimotor monoplane transport aircraft, which was developed in response to an enquiry by the Italian airline Ala Littoria for a modern, middle- to long-range airliner and cargo aircraft; it featured an early implementation of retractable main landing gear and was capable of long-range missions, such as transporting up to 24 passengers over 1,000 miles. Another was the SM.81 &quot;Pipistrello&quot;, which became the first three-engine bomber/transport aircraft to be adopted by the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;; furthermore, it would be one of the most flexible, reliable, and important aircraft operated by the service through the Second World War, transitioning from a front-line bomber to various second-line duties towards the conflict&#x27;s latter years.

The company became increasingly focused on the construction of military aircraft during the lead-up to, and throughout the majority of, World War II. In particular, the SM.79 &quot;Sparviero&quot; trimotor Italian medium bomber has been claimed by aviation authors Enzo Angelucci and Paolo Matricardi as being the best-known Italian aeroplane of the conflict. Performing its first flight on 28 September 1934, early examples of the type established 26 separate world records between 1937 and 1939, qualifying the SM.79 for some time as being the fastest medium bomber in the world. It was operated in various capacities during the war, initially focusing on its transport and medium-bomber duties. The SM.79 was developed into an effective torpedo bomber, in which capacity it achieved numerous successes against Allied shipping in the Mediterranean theater.

During 1943, the company was rebranded as SIAI-Marchetti. As the conflict turned in favour of the Allies, the company&#x27;s manufacturing facilities were a particularly high-priority target for enemy bombers, leading to their virtual destruction by the final months of WWII. The firm continued to make efforts to design and produce new aircraft, such as the SM-93 dive bomber during 1944, but the economic consequences of the costly war made such ambitions unrealistic at best.
During the immediate postwar era, SIAI-Marchetti endeavoured to survive within the commercially inhospitable climate by diversifying into the manufacture of various items of railway equipment and trucks though efforts were not successful. The company was relatively insolvent, operating as such for roughly six years following the conflict&#x27;s end before being compelled to declare bankruptcy in September 1951. During the firm&#x27;s bankruptcy, all of its staff were dismissed, although more than half were re-employed by the liquidator to complete outstanding orders. During 1953, the company re-emerged from the bankruptcy process, and quickly began to focus its development efforts on the emerging market for helicopters.

Largely as a result of its investment into helicopters, SIAI-Marchetti was acquired by Italian helicopter specialist Agusta during 1983. Its remaining fixed-wing assets were subsequently absorbed by the aircraft manufacturing interest Aermacchi during 1997.

<text>The name example is reserved by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as a domain name that may not be installed as a top-level domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.

==Reserved DNS names==
In 1999, the Internet Engineering Task Force reserved the DNS labels &quot;example&quot;, &quot;invalid&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;, and &quot;test&quot; so that they may not be installed into the root zone of the Domain Name System.

The reason for reservation of these top-level domain names is to reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion. This allows the use of these names for either documentation purposes or in local testing scenarios.

==Purpose==
The top-level domain is explicitly intended to be used in documentation or other technical writing, when domain names are presented as examples in usage or presentation of concepts of the Domain Name System or the Internet.

<doc id="1239770" wikidata="Q2333552" url="?curid=1239770" title="Hatchery">
<text>A hatchery is a facility where eggs are hatched under artificial conditions, especially those of fish, poultry or even turtles. It may be used for &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation purposes, i.e. to breed rare or endangered species under controlled conditions; alternatively, it may be for economic reasons (i.e. to enhance food supplies or fishery resources).

==Fish hatcheries==
Fish hatcheries are used to cultivate and breed a large number of fish in an enclosed environment. Fish farms use hatcheries to cultivate fish to sell for food, or ornamental purposes, eliminating the need to find the fish in the wild and even providing some species outside their natural season. They raise the fish until they are ready to be eaten or sold to aquarium stores. Other hatcheries release the juvenile fish into a river, lake or the ocean to support commercial, tribal, or recreational fishing or to supplement the natural numbers of threatened or endangered species, a practice known as fish stocking.

Researchers have raised concerns about hatchery fish potentially breeding with wild fish. Hatchery fish escapees may in some cases compete with wild fish. There have been cases of more hatchery reared salmon being found in Canadian streams then wild reared salmon. This causes excess competition in wild salmon populations and can introduce unwanted genes and diseases. In the United States and Canada, there have been several salmon and steelhead hatchery reform projects intended to reduce the possibility of negative impacts from hatchery programs. Most salmon and steelhead hatcheries are managed better and follow up to date management practices to ensure any risks are curtailed.

==Poultry hatcheries==

Poultry hatcheries produce a majority of the birds consumed in the developed world including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and some other minor bird species. A few poultry hatcheries specialize in producing birds for sale to backyard poultry keepers, hobby farmers, and people who are interested in competing with their birds at poultry shows. These hatcheries produce chicks of several different breeds and varieties, often including some heritage or endangered breeds.

Larger poultry hatcheries are related to industrial poultry meat or egg production. This is a multibillion-dollar industry, with highly regimented production systems used to maximize bird size or egg production versus feed consumed. Generally large numbers are produced at one time so the resulting birds are uniform in size and can be slaughtered (for meat) or brought into production (for eggs) at the same time. A large hatchery produces 15 million chicks annually.

Poultry generally start with naturally (most species) or artificially (turkeys and Cornish-related chicken breeds) inseminated hens that lay eggs; the eggs are cleaned and shells are checked for soundness before being put into the incubators. Incubators control temperature and humidity, and turn the eggs until just before they hatch. Three days before the eggs are scheduled to hatch, they are moved into a hatcher unit, where they are no longer turned so the embryos have time to get properly oriented for their exit from the shell, and the temperature and humidity are optimum for hatching. The eggs will hatch during a period that is often referred to as the hatching window, which can stretch from 24 to 48 hours depending on biological variation. Once the eggs hatch and the chicks are a few days old, they are often vaccinated. Chicks hatched conventionally are provided feed and water first when they reach the rearing farm. In the meantime, they rely on their yolk sac for nutrients.

== Turtle hatcheries ==
A turtle hatchery is a place where turtle eggs can be taken from wild nests to hatch in a more controlled environment. The purpose of a turtle hatchery is to benefit conservation efforts. Sea turtle species are becoming endangered due to climate change. Turtles sexes are based on the nest temperature that the eggs are stored in. Due to climate change, more turtles are hatching as females. Turtle hatcheries are combatting this issue by moving eggs to an area of the beach with increased shading and extra cooling factors, and increased depth of nests to hatch more male turtles. The hatchlings, if healthy upon hatching, are able to leave on their own and make the trek to the ocean just like non-hatchery born turtles. Sea turtle hatcheries are usually successful in producing more turtles than untouched nests.

Turtle hatcheries have ethical concerns brought on by the public. Many hatcheries located on coasts are marketed as tourist attractions. These locations let the general public handle the eggs and keep hatchlings back for visitors to handle and photograph. Most sea turtle species eggs hatch at night to minimize the risk of predation and overheating caused by the frenzy of the initial crawl to the water. Humans are the biggest threat to turtles due to hunting, poaching, egg theft, pet trade, and bycatch from fishing. When hatcheries hold hatchling turtles back for tourists, the hatchling is exposed to its largest predator, they are released in the day after the nutrients from their yolk sack are used up, and predators can easily spot them on the trek to the ocean.
