<text>Ralph Thomas Reed (July 6, 1890, Philadelphia – January 21, 1968, New York City) was the president of the American Express Company from 1944 to 1960. He joined the company in 1919 as assistant to the controller. He was the person who made the decision to create the American Express charge card, first issued in 1958.

==Biography==
He was born on July 6, 1890 in Philadelphia, to William Arter and Jennie Smith Reed. He was raised in Philadelphia, the second son of a Welsh-born lumber company accountant. He won a scholarship to Princeton, but dropped out when his father became unemployed. Reed got an accounting job, and at night, began attending Wharton School. In 1915, he graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

He joined American Express as assistant to the controller in 1919. From 1944 to 1960 he was president of American Express. &quot;TIME&quot; magazine in 1956 described Reed, as Amex president, as the &quot;businessman who first applied to foreign travel all the ingenuity and resources of U.S. industry,&quot; stating he had done &quot;more than anyone else in the world to lure the American abroad and make his trip a success.&quot; In his twelve years as president, he had increased the company&#x27;s offices from 50 to 344, increased employees from 1,500 to 8,600, and saw a 318% increase in total assets, at $621 million. He also saw the implementation of Amex programs intended to make travel easier and cheaper for Americans, including trip planning services, and detective services to find traveling family members and missing items. &quot;TIME&quot; noted his personal proclivity for lavish international travel and tipping, and that he once &quot;rented the entire first floor of London’s Hotel Savoy to entertain 500 cocktail guests.&quot; Reed approved the first Amex card, which appeared in 1958. He was succeeded as president of Amexco in 1960 by Howard L. Clark. He was chairman of the executive committee of Amex from 1960 to 1965, when he retired.

He was on the advisory committee of the Foreign Service Institute of the United States State Department and was also an adviser to the Voice of America. President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him the US representative at the inauguration of the President of Nicaragua in 1957.

He was married to Edna May Young, and their daughter was named Phyllis Ann Reed. A resident of New York City and Palm Beach, Ralph T. Reed died at Roosevelt Hospital in New York in July 1890 after falling ill, at the age of 77.

==Boards and committees==
He was a director of the Western Union Telegraph Company, the American International Life Assurance Company of New York, the First National Bank of West Palm Beach, Florida, and the Lafayette Fellowship Foundation of Philadelphia.

He was on the board of the directors of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, a trustee of Roosevelt Hospital, and a trustee of the United States Trust Company of New York.

<doc id="1235534" wikidata="Q5447933" url="?curid=1235534" title="Fighting Whites">
<text>The Fighting Whites (alternatively identified as Fightin&#x27; Whites, Fighting Whities, or Fightin&#x27; Whities) were an basketball team formed at the University of Northern Colorado in 2002 and named in response to the Native American mascot controversy.

The intramural college team briefly attracted a storm of national attention because of its satirical protest about stereotypes of Native Americans being used as sports mascots, particularly the &quot;Fightin&#x27; Reds&quot; of Eaton High School in Eaton, Colorado, not far from the university in Greeley. The Reds&#x27; mascot has been described as &quot;a caricature Indian with a misshapen nose, [wearing] a loincloth and eagle feather&quot;.

The intramural team, which included players of Native American, Caucasian, Latino, African American, and Middle Eastern ancestry, adopted the name &quot;Fighting Whites&quot;, with an accompanying logo of a stereotypical &quot;white man&quot; in a suit, styled after advertising art of the 1950s, as their team mascot. The character has been described as a man from the Ozzie Nelson era or a &quot;&quot;Father Knows Best&quot; white American male&quot;.

At first, the team&#x27;s T-shirts used &quot;Fightin&#x27; Whites&quot; as the name of the team, but various media reports referred to the team as the &quot;Whities&quot; instead of &quot;Whites&quot;. The team&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed. In response to customer demand, the team eventually began selling shirts under both names. The team added the phrase &quot;Fighting the use of Native American stereotypes&quot; to its merchandise to discourage the shirts from being worn by white supremacists, and arranged for CafePress.com to handle manufacturing and sales of the clothing.

The team sold enough shirts that they were eventually able to endow a sizeable scholarship fund for Native American students at Northern Colorado. In 2003, the team donated $100,000 to the University of Northern Colorado&#x27;s UNC Foundation, which included $79,000 designated for the &quot;Fightin&#x27; Whites Minority Scholarship&quot;.

<doc id="1235535" wikidata="Q2840194" url="?curid=1235535" title="Ralph Reed">
<text>Ralph Eugene Reed Jr. (born June 24, 1961) is an American political consultant and lobbyist, best known as the first executive director of the Christian Coalition during the early 1990s. He sought the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia but lost the primary election on July 18, 2006, to State Senator Casey Cagle. Reed started the Faith and Freedom Coalition in June 2009. He is a member of the Council for National Policy.

==Early life and education==
Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, to Navy ophthalmologist Ralph Reed and mother Marcy Reed, Ralph Jr. moved often as a child, but spent most of his childhood in Miami, Florida. He moved with his family to Toccoa, Georgia, in 1976, earning Eagle Scout at BSA Troop 77 and graduating from Stephens County High School in 1979. He graduated from the University of Georgia with a BA in history in 1985. Reed served as a columnist and editor of the college newspaper, &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot;. In 1983, Reed, then a senior at the University of Georgia, wrote a column for &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot; with the headline &quot;Gandhi: Ninny of the Twentieth Century.&quot; Shortly after the article ran, another student wrote that &quot;every assertion, every quote, and several seemingly original Reed phrases may be found directly or in slightly modified form&quot; in a commentary article by Richard Grenier. Reed was then discharged from his role on the college newspaper for plagiarism. He was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society, the Jasper Dorsey Intercollegiate Debate Society, and College Republicans. He is also an alumnus of the Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia, an organization that teaches conservative Americans to influence public policy through activism and leadership. Reed obtained his PhD in American history from Emory University in 1991.

==Career==
Reed spent much of his college career as a political activist, taking six years to earn his undergraduate degree. He started with the University of Georgia College Republicans, steadily rising to state and then national leadership. He was later profiled in &quot;Gang of Five&quot; by Nina Easton, along with Grover Norquist and other young activists who got their start in the 1980s.

===The triumvirate===
In 1981, Reed moved to Washington, D.C., to intern at the College Republican National Committee (CRNC). At the CRNC, Jack Abramoff, Norquist, and Reed formed what was known as the &quot;Abramoff-Norquist-Reed triumvirate.&quot; Abramoff promoted Reed in 1983, appointing him to succeed Norquist as Executive Director of the CRNC. Norquist later served as president of Americans for Tax Reform, in Washington, D.C.

===Religious experience===
Reed has said that, in September 1983, he had a religious experience while at Bullfeathers, an upscale pub in Capitol Hill popular with staffers (and, to a lesser extent, members) of the House of Representatives. Of the experience, Reed said, &quot;the Holy Spirit simply demanded me to come to Jesus&quot;. He walked outside the pub to a phone booth, thumbed through the yellow pages under &quot;Churches,&quot; and found the Evangelical Assembly of God Church in Camp Springs, Maryland. He visited the next morning and became a born-again Christian.

===Students for America===
After receiving his AB he moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to help start and lead Students for America (SFA), a conservative activist group supported by U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. SFA became largely dominated by members of Maranatha Campus Ministries, and this brought Reed into contact with Ed Buckham and Jim Backlin, the current Legislative Director of the Christian Coalition. Reed&#x27;s links to Tom DeLay were forged through his association with Buckham and Backlin.

SFA established chapters on college campuses up and down the East Coast and held conferences. Among other issues, SFA supported Helms&#x27; bid for re-election and organized abortion clinic protests. Reed was temporarily arrested during an abortion protest at the Fleming Center Abortion Clinic in Raleigh but was not charged with any crime. After Reed left SFA for a bigger job at the Christian Coalition, SFA faded out of existence by the early 1990s.

=== Role in the Christian Coalition ===

Reed was hired by religious broadcaster and Presidential candidate Pat Robertson as executive director of the Christian Coalition in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Robertson, his son, Gordon P. Robertson, Dick Weinold, a Robertson activist from Texas, and Billy McCormack, a pastor from Shreveport, Louisiana, were the original four directors of the organization. McCormack also held the title of &quot;vice president&quot; and had been his state director of &quot;Americans for Robertson&quot; in 1988.

Reed led the organization from 1989 to 1997. After Republicans lost in the 1996 elections many thought Reed would not be long for the Coalition, and would soon depart seeking new challenges. Some alleged that another factor in Reed&#x27;s decision was an investigation by federal prosecutors due to charges made by the Christian Coalition&#x27;s former chief financial officer, Judy Liebert. Reed resigned from his post, and moved to Georgia. The Coalition&#x27;s finances were collapsing, and the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission were investigating.

The Coalition organized former Robertson supporters and other religious conservatives to oppose political liberalism. Eschewing confrontational tactics of street protest learned in college, Reed attempted to project a &quot;softer&quot; public face for Christian conservatism, self-described as &quot;guerrilla&quot;, putting &quot;enemies&quot; in &quot;body bags&quot; before they even realized he had struck.

In the 1990s, Reed and the coalition protested the Clinton administration&#x27;s policies. They were credited with mobilizing Christian conservatives in support of Republican candidates in the 1994 Congressional elections. Reed appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on May 15, 1995, under the title &quot;The Right Hand of God: Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition.&quot;

In 1996, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought an enforcement action in United States District Court, alleging Reed and the coalition &quot;violated federal campaign finance laws during congressional elections in 1990, 1992 and 1994, and the presidential election in 1992.&quot; After a three-year investigation and lawsuit, a federal court ordered the Coalition to pay a small fine for two minor infractions, significantly less than the FEC had called for.

On resigning as executive director of the Christian Coalition, Reed moved to the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Duluth to begin a career as a political consultant and lobbyist.

=== 1998 Georgia gubernatorial election ===

In late 1997, Reed joined the campaign of Fulton County Commission Chairman Mitch Skandalakis for lieutenant governor of Georgia, becoming its general consultant. In addition to planning campaign strategy, Reed appeared in advertisements, identifying himself as the former head of the Christian Coalition and vouching for Skandalakis&#x27;s conservative credentials and personal integrity.

In the primary, Skandalakis placed first among the five Republican candidates, but did not receive a majority of the vote and was forced into a run-off with second-place finisher State Senator Clint Day. Reed planned a series of advertisements that included charges that Day had &quot;desecrated Indian graves&quot; on a plot of land owned by a Day family foundation. The Skandalakis campaign held a conference at which tribal leaders, wearing headdress and other ceremonial clothing, attacked Day as a &quot;vandal&quot; and &quot;grave robber.&quot;

Reed&#x27;s strategy initially met with success, as Skandalakis narrowly defeated Day in the Republican primary run-off. But Skandalakis lost the general election.

===Century Strategies===
While running the Skandalakis campaign in 1997, Reed co-founded Century Strategies with political strategist Tim Phillips. Century Strategies describes itself as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s leading public affairs and public relations firms.&quot; While initially engaged primarily in campaign consulting for Republican candidates its mission evolved into advocacy and lobbying.

Reed helped Alabama Governor Fob James win renomination in a bitterly contested Republican primary, only to become the first Republican in over a decade to lose the Alabama governor&#x27;s election. Immediately after the 1998 election, Reed shifted gears to corporate work. In 1999, Abramoff helped Reed get hired as a consultant subcontractor for Preston Gates &amp; Ellis.

Reed is credited with attacks on Senator John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina presidential primary, together with Roberta Combs, then head of the South Carolina Christian Coalition, who later took over the national Christian Coalition. Bush&#x27;s defeat of McCain in that primary came at a key moment and ended McCain&#x27;s early momentum from an upset victory in the New Hampshire primary.

Reed&#x27;s $20,000 per month contract with Microsoft proved a minor embarrassment to the Bush campaign in the summer of 2000 when it was revealed that the software giant, which was being prosecuted for antitrust violations, had hired a number of Bush aides as consultants and lobbyists. Reed apologized for the &quot;appearance of conflict&quot; but continued to accept the money until 2005, when Microsoft terminated Reed amid the Indian gaming scandal.

Some conservatives have criticized Reed&#x27;s choice of clients and suggested that he has inappropriately profited from his credentials as a conservative Christian leader. The conservative Alabama group Obligation, Inc. is a fierce critic of Reed&#x27;s client Channel One News, arguing that the company pumps classrooms full of &quot;commercials for junk food and sleazy movies.&quot;

In 1999, Reed&#x27;s firm sent out a mailer to Alabama conservative Christians asking them to call then-Representative Bob Riley and tell him to vote against legislation that would have made the Northern Mariana Islands subject to federal wage and worker safety laws. Abramoff represented the commonwealth as a partner of Greenberg Traurig and received $4.04 million from 1998 to 2002. Greenberg Traurig, in turn, hired Reed&#x27;s firm to print the mailing.

===Georgia Republican Party chairman===
In 2001, Reed mounted a campaign for State Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, a volunteer job. His candidacy attracted national media attention, and challenges from three opponents.

Reed&#x27;s principal opponent was David Shafer, a former executive director of the Georgia Republican Party recruited to the race by Congressman John Linder. Shafer campaigned on Republican gains made when he served as state executive director in the early 1990s, but was hampered by his subsequent association with the failed campaigns of Mack Mattingly, Guy Millner and Clint Day in the later half of the decade.

The state convention, held at the Cobb Galleria in May 2001, was the most heavily attended and longest running in the history of the party. Reed won on the first ballot, capturing almost 60% of the delegate vote to Shafer&#x27;s 40%. Lobbyist Maria Rose Strollo won 1%.

Reed was endorsed by the &quot;Confederate Republican Caucus,&quot; a block of almost 500 &quot;heritage&quot; activists who had participated in the state convention as a protest against the removal of the Confederate battle emblem from the State Flag. The organization later claimed it had been &quot;double-crossed&quot; by Reed.

Documents released by federal investigators in 2005 show that Reed&#x27;s 2001 campaign for State Chairman was partially financed with contributions from the Choctaws, an Indian gaming tribe represented by Abramoff.

The party experienced success in the 2002 elections under Reed&#x27;s leadership. Saxby Chambliss was elected U.S. senator and Sonny Perdue was elected governor. Reed, however, was asked to relinquish his job as State Chairman by Perdue, whose long-shot candidacy was largely ignored by Reed in favor of Chambliss.

Reed supported the candidacy of Congressman Bob Barr, who had moved into the neighboring district of Congressman John Linder and challenged his renomination. Linder decisively defeated Barr.

===Campaign for lieutenant governor===
Speculation about a Reed candidacy for Lieutenant Governor began building shortly after the 2004 general election. Republican party leaders were unenthusiastic about the candidacy of Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, who had been &quot;exploring&quot; a race for Lieutenant Governor for over a year. Aides to Governor Sonny Perdue tried to recruit House Republican Leader Jerry Keen as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor, while State Senators Casey Cagle and Bill Stephens jockeyed for support among Senate Republicans.

Reed claimed support of the White House, access to the Bush fundraising apparatus and command of a large grass roots organization. His official declaration of candidacy on February 17, 2005 largely cleared the field of opposition; Keen, Stephens and Oxendine all left the race. Keen, a former state chairman of the Christian Coalition, was the first to drop, followed quickly by Stephens. Although insisting at the time of Reed&#x27;s entry into the race that he would &quot;never&quot; withdraw, Oxendine ended his candidacy two weeks later. Only Cagle, a relatively unknown lawmaker, remained in the race to challenge Reed.

A poll conducted for Oxendine was the first indication of trouble for Reed. Released shortly before Oxendine&#x27;s exit from the race, the poll showed Oxendine defeating Reed among likely Republican voters by a large margin. It also showed Reed losing the general election to the only announced Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, former State Senator Greg Hecht. Little attention was paid to the poll because Oxendine folded his own candidacy shortly after it was released. Reed himself dismissed the poll as a face-saving gesture by an embarrassed Oxendine.

Reed&#x27;s campaign experienced a loss of momentum with revelations about his role in the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. Email documents released in the investigation revealed details about Reed&#x27;s financial relationships with Abramoff.

Reed&#x27;s early lead in fund-raising evaporated by December 31, 2005, when disclosure reports showed Cagle raising almost twice as much money as Reed in the last six months of the year.

Bob Irvin, a former U.S. House of Representatives Republican leader, was the first prominent Republican to publicly call on Reed to withdraw from the race. 21 state senators signed a letter in February 2006 calling on Reed to withdraw from the race, &quot;declaring that his ties to Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff could jeopardize the re-election of Gov. Sonny Perdue and the rest of the GOP ticket.” Reed rejected the petition as a useless stunt, and expressed confidence that his record and ideas would prevail.

Aides to Speaker of the House Glenn Richardson, ostensibly neutral in the race, released a poll that showed Reed&#x27;s mounting negatives could hurt Perdue and the Republican ticket. On March 21, 2006, political consultant Matt Towery of Insider Advantage released a poll showing Reed represented an eight-point drag on the Perdue ticket.

Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine, whose ambitions had been upended by Reed&#x27;s candidacy, endorsed Cagle in June 2006, saying that Reed&#x27;s nomination threatened the success of the Republican ticket.

Two dozen members of the Reed steering committee, including a Reed State Co-Chairman, resigned from the Reed campaign and endorsed Cagle, but Reed continued his pursuit of the nomination.

New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani traveled to Georgia to campaign for Reed. A Democrat, conservative former United States Senator Zell Miller, also endorsed Reed.

On July 18, 2006, Reed lost the Republican primary to Cagle with 44% of the vote to Cagle&#x27;s 56%. According to Politics1.com, Reed indicated he would not likely seek elective office ever again.

=== Indian gambling scandals ===
Reed was named, but never charged with any wrongdoing, in the scandal arising from lobbying work Jack Abramoff performed on behalf of Indian gambling tribes. Emails released by federal investigators in 2005 revealed that Reed secretly accepted payments from Abramoff to lobby against Indian casino gambling and oppose an Alabama education lottery and that Reed also worked for another Abramoff client seeking to block a congressional ban on Internet gambling. These cases are being investigated by multiple federal and state grand juries and by the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony counts in federal court, raising the prospects of Abramoff testifying against others.

Those emails and other evidence revealed the participation of the Christian Coalition in the alleged fraud, particularly its Alabama chapter, which received large amounts of donations from the casino money. It is alleged that Abramoff engaged Reed to set up an anti-gambling campaign to include the U.S. Family Network, the Christian Coalition, and Focus on the Family in order to frighten the tribes into spending as much as $82 million for Abramoff to lobby on their behalf. To represent him in connection with the scandal, Reed retained defense attorney W. Neil Eggleston, then of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP. Eggleston served as White House associate counsel during the administration of President Bill Clinton.

In 2004, Reed confirmed that he had been paid more than $1 million in fees by lobbyists working on behalf of American Indian casinos.

In December 2005, three Texas public interest groups filed a complaint with Travis County Attorney David Escamilla on December 1, 2005, alleging that Reed failed to register as a lobbyist in 2001 or 2002 when he was working for Abramoff. Escamilla said on March 27, 2006, &quot;his office had concluded its investigation—but that a two-year statute of limitations on misdemeanors from 2001 and 2002 had expired.&quot;

On June 22, 2006, the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs released its final report on the scandal. It said that Reed had used his contacts to conservative Christian groups to prevent the opening or expansion of casinos competing with the casinos operated by Abramoff&#x27;s clients from 1998 to 2002 and had been paid $5.3 million through Abramoff&#x27;s law firm and from organizations controlled by Abramoff&#x27;s partner Michael Scanlon. The report did not accuse Reed of having known about Abramoff&#x27;s illegal activities.

The report also says that under the guidance of the Mississippi Choctaw tribe&#x27;s planner, Nell Rogers, the tribe agreed to launder money because &quot;Ralph Reed did not want to be paid directly by a tribe with gaming interests&quot;, that Reed used nonprofits like Grover Norquist&#x27;s Americans for Tax Reform as pass-throughs to disguise the funds&#x27; origin, and that &quot;the structure was recommended by Jack Abramoff to accommodate Mr. Reed’s political concerns.&quot; Reed was never charged with any wrongdoing in the Indian gambling scandals.

===Faith and Freedom Coalition===

In 2009, Reed founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and as of 2023 continues to serve as its chairman.

<doc id="1235539" wikidata="Q58010" url="?curid=1235539" title="Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach">
<text>Prince Wilhelm of Urach, Count of Württemberg, 2nd Duke of Urach (&quot;Wilhelm Karl Florestan Gero Crescentius&quot;; German: &quot;Fürst Wilhelm von Urach, Graf von Württemberg, 2. Herzog von Urach&quot;; 3 March 1864 – 24 March 1928), was a German prince who was elected in June 1918 as King of Lithuania, with the regnal name of Mindaugas II. He never assumed the crown, however, as German authorities declared the election invalid; the invitation was withdrawn in November 1918. From 17 July 1869 until his death, he was the head of the morganatic Urach branch of the House of Württemberg.

==Early life==
Born as Wilhelm Karl Florestan Gero Crescentius, Count of Württemberg, he was the elder son of Wilhelm, 1st Duke of Urach (the head of a morganatic branch of the Royal House of the Kingdom of Württemberg), and his second wife, Princess Florestine of Monaco, occasional Regent of Monaco and daughter of Florestan I, Prince of Monaco.

At the age of four, Wilhelm succeeded his father as Duke of Urach. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Monaco, where his mother Florestine often managed the government during the extended oceanographic expeditions of her nephew, Prince Albert I. Wilhelm was culturally francophone.

==Candidate for various thrones==
Through his mother, Wilhelm was a legitimate heir to the throne of Monaco. Wilhelm&#x27;s cousin Prince Albert I of Monaco had only one child, Prince Louis, who was unmarried and had no legitimate children. The French Republic, however, was reluctant to see a German prince ruling Monaco. Under French pressure, Monaco passed a law in 1911 recognising Louis&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, as heir; she was adopted in 1918 by her grandfather Prince Albert I as part of the Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918. Wilhelm was relegated to third in line to Monaco&#x27;s throne, behind Louis and Charlotte. Furthermore, in July 1918 France and Monaco signed the Franco-Monegasque Treaty; it required all future princes of Monaco to be French or Monegasque citizens and secure the approval of the French government to succeed to the throne. After the accession of Prince Louis II in 1922, Wilhelm renounced his rights of succession to the throne of Monaco in favour of distant French cousins, the counts de Chabrillan, in 1924.

In 1913, Wilhelm was one of several princes considered for the throne of Albania. He was supported by Catholic groups in the north and attended the Albanian Congress of Trieste. In 1914, Prince William of Wied was selected instead.

In 1917, as a newly retired general, Wilhelm sounded out the possibility of being made Grand Duke of Alsace-Lorraine after the war was over. In 1918, he accepted the short-lived invitation to reign as Mindaugas II of Lithuania. His claims were published in a 2001 essay by his grandson-in-law, Sergei von Cube.

==Military career==
As was typical of members of his family, Wilhelm entered the army in 1883 and served as a professional officer. By the outbreak of World War I, he was a &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; and commander of the 26th Infantry Division (1st Royal Württemberg) of the Imperial German Army. Until November 1914 this division was part of the German assault on France and Belgium, where Wilhelm&#x27;s sister-in-law Elisabeth of Belgium was queen. In December 1914, the division fought in the battle to cross the Bzura river in Poland. From June to September 1915, the division moved from north of Warsaw to positions close to the Neman River, an advance of hundreds of miles in the campaign in which Poland was taken (the Great Russian Retreat of World War I). In October–November 1915, the division took part in the Serbian Campaign, moving from west of Belgrade to Kraljevo in less than a month. The division served at Ypres in Belgium from December 1915 to July 1916, then was largely destroyed at the Somme battles from August to November 1916 while holding the &quot;Schwaben Redoubt&quot; (Swabia is part of Württemberg).

On 30 December 1916, Wilhelm was named commanding general of the 64th Corps (Generalkommando 64) on the Western Front, taking command on 5 January 1917 and holding it until 10 December 1918 when the corps-level command was deactivated. He was promoted to &quot;General der Kavallerie&quot; on 25 February 1917. His aides de camp included Eugen Ott and Erwin Rommel.

==King of Lithuania==

On 4 June 1918, the Council of Lithuania voted to invite Wilhelm to become the king of a newly independent Lithuania. Wilhelm agreed and was elected on 11 July 1918, taking the name Mindaugas II. His election can be explained by several factors:
*he was Roman Catholic (the dominant religion in Lithuania);
*he was not a member of the House of Hohenzollern, the family to which belonged the German Emperor William II, who wanted Lithuania to be a monarchy in personal union with Prussia;
*the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of March 1918 had established Germany&#x27;s power in the region, for the time being;
*he had had a successful military career;
*if the Central Powers were to win the war, Lithuania could have expected German protection in the event of future intrusions by Russia.
According to Wilhelm&#x27;s agreement with the Council of Lithuania, he had to live in Lithuania and learn to speak its language.

In addition, he was also descended from Casimir IV Jagiellon, grand duke of Lithuania, through his daughter Barbara Jagiellon.

From the beginning, Wilhelm&#x27;s reign was controversial. The four socialists of the twenty members of the Council of Lithuania left in protest. The German government did not recognize Wilhelm&#x27;s selection as king, although the influential publicist and politician Matthias Erzberger, also a Catholic from Württemberg, supported the claim. Wilhelm never had the chance to visit Lithuania; he remained instead at Lichtenstein Castle, his home south of Stuttgart. He did start to learn the Lithuanian language, however. Within a few months of his election, it became clear that Germany would lose World War I, and on 2 November 1918, the Council of Lithuania reversed its decision.

In the tiny chapel of Lichtenstein Castle is a framed letter from Pope Benedict XV welcoming Wilhelm&#x27;s selection as the future king of Lithuania.

In 2009, Wilhelm&#x27;s grandson Inigo was interviewed on television in Vilnius, and said: &quot;...if he was honoured with a proposal to assume the throne of Lithuania, he would not refuse it.&quot;

The German anti-war novelist Arnold Zweig set his 1937 novel &quot;Einsetzung eines Königs&quot; (The Crowning of a King) around the election of Mindaugas in 1918.

==Marriages and children==
Wilhelm was married twice. On 4 July 1892, he married firstly Duchess Amalie in Bavaria (1865–1912), daughter of Karl-Theodor, Duke in Bavaria, a niece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, and a direct descendant of the Lithuanian princess Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł of Biržai. Nine children were born of this marriage:

* Princess Marie Gabriele (1893–1908)
* Princess Elizabeth (1894–1962) who married Prince Karl of Liechtenstein (1878–1955), an uncle of Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and had issue.
* Princess Karola (1896–1980)
* Prince Wilhelm (1897–1957), who morganatically married Elisabeth Theurer (1899–1988) and had two daughters, Elisabeth and Marie Christine, neither of whom married.
* Karl Gero, Duke of Urach (1899–1981), 3rd Duke of Urach, who married Countess Gabriele of Waldburg-Zeil (1910–2005); no issue.
* Princess Margarete (1901–1975)
* Prince Albrecht (1903–1969), a diplomat; former artist turned journalist, and expert on the Far East. Married first Rosemary Blackadder and second Ute Waldschmidt, divorced both of them and had issue by both. His daughter Marie-Gabrielle (&quot;aka&quot; Mariga) was the first wife of Desmond Guinness. Albrecht&#x27;s marriages were also considered morganatic, but his descendants use &quot;Furst von Urach&quot; as their surname.
* Prince Eberhard (1907–1969), who married Princess Iniga of Thurn and Taxis (1925–2008) and had issue: Karl Anselm, Duke of Urach, born 1955, Wilhelm Albert, Duke of Urach, born 1957 and Prince Inigo of Urach, born 1962. 
* Princess Mechtilde (1912–2001), who married Friedrich Karl, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfürst and had issue.

In 1924, Wilhelm married secondly Princess Wiltrud of Bavaria (1884–1975), daughter of King Ludwig III of Bavaria. This marriage was childless.

Prince Eberhard&#x27;s son Inigo made a sentimental journey to Lithuania in November 2009, which was covered by the local media.

<doc id="1235541" wikidata="Q1127505" url="?curid=1235541" title="Louis, Duke of Burgundy">
<text>Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy (6 August 1682 – 18 February 1712), was the eldest son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, and Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria and grandson of the reigning French king, Louis XIV. He was known as the &quot;Petit Dauphin&quot; to distinguish him from his father. When his father died in April 1711, the Duke of Burgundy became the official Dauphin of France. He never reigned, as he died in 1712 while his grandfather was still on the throne. Upon the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s third son became Louis XV.

==Childhood==

Louis was born in the Palace of Versailles in 1682, the eldest son of the French Dauphin, Louis, who would later be called &quot;le Grand Dauphin&quot;, and his wife, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. His father was the eldest son of the reigning king, Louis XIV and his wife Queen Maria Theresa of Spain. At birth, he received the title of Duke of Burgundy (&quot;duc de Bourgogne&quot;). In addition, as the son of the Dauphin and grandson to the king, he was a &quot;fils de France&quot; and also second in the line of succession to his grandfather, Louis XIV, after his father.

Louis grew up with his younger brothers Philip, Duke of Anjou (who became King Philip V of Spain), and Charles, Duke of Berry, under the supervision of the royal governess Louise de Prie. He lost his mother when he was eight. His father, viewed as lazy and dull, never played a major role in politics.

== Marriage ==
 At the age of 15, he was married to his double second cousin, Princess Marie-Adélaïde of Savoy, the daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy and Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans. This match had been decided as part of the Treaty of Turin, which ended Franco-Savoyard conflicts during the Nine Years&#x27; War. The wedding took place on 7 December 1697 at the Palace of Versailles.

== Military career and politics ==

In 1702, at the age of 20, Louis was admitted by his grandfather King Louis XIV to the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en haut&quot; (High Council), which was in charge of state secrets regarding religion, diplomacy and war. His father had been admitted only at the age of 30.

In 1708, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Louis was given command of the army in Flanders, with the experienced soldier Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme, serving under him. The uncertainty as to which of the two should truly command the army led to delays and the need to refer decisions to Louis XIV. Continued indecision led to French inactivity as messages travelled between the front and Versailles; the Allies were then able to take the initiative. The culmination of this was the Battle of Oudenarde, where Louis&#x27;s mistaken choices and reluctance to support Vendôme led to a decisive defeat for the French. In the aftermath of the defeat, his hesitation to relieve the Siege of Lille led to the loss of the city and thereby allowed the Allies to make their first incursions onto French soil.

Louis was influenced by the &quot;dévots&quot; and was surrounded by a circle of people known as the &quot;faction de Bourgogne&quot;, notably including his old tutor François Fénelon, his old governor Paul de Beauvilliers, Duke of Saint-Aignan and his brother-in-law Charles Honoré d&#x27;Albert, Duke of Chevreuse, as well as the renowned memorialist, Louis de Rouvroy, Duke of Saint-Simon.

These high-ranking aristocrats sought a return to a monarchy less absolute and less centralised, with more powers granted to the individual provinces. Their view was that government should work through councils and intermediary organs between the king and the people. These intermediary councils were to be made up not by commoners from the bourgeoisie (like the ministers appointed by Louis XIV) but by aristocrats who perceived themselves as the representatives of the people and would assist the king in governance and the exercise of power. Had Louis succeeded to the throne, he might have applied this concept of monarchy.

== Death and legacy ==
Louis became Dauphin of France upon the death of his father in 1711. In February 1712, his wife contracted measles and died on February 12. Louis himself, who dearly loved his wife and who had stayed by her side throughout the fatal illness, caught the disease and died six days after her at the Château de Marly on 18 February, aged 29. Both of his sons also became infected. The elder, Louis, Duke of Brittany, the latest in a series of Dauphins, succumbed on 8 March, leaving his brother, the two-year-old Duke of Anjou, who was later to succeed to the throne as Louis XV.

As it was thought that the chances of survival of this frail child, now heir apparent to his seventy-three-year-old great grandfather, were minimal, a potential succession crisis loomed.

Moreover, overnight the broad hopes of the &quot;faction de Bourgogne&quot; were destroyed and its members would soon die of natural deaths. Nonetheless, some of their ideas were put into practice when the Duke of Orléans, as regent during Louis XV&#x27;s minority, created a form of government known as polysynody, in which each ministry was replaced by a council composed of aristocrats. However, the absenteeism, ineptitude and squabbling of the aristocrats caused this system to fail, and it was soon abandoned in 1718 in favour of a return to absolute monarchy.

==Issue==
#Louis, Duke of Brittany (25 June 1704 – 13 April 1705) died of convulsions;
#Louis, Duke of Brittany (8 January 1707 – 8 March 1712) died of measles;
#Louis XV of France (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774) first engaged to Mariana Victoria of Spain; married Marie Leszczyńska and had issue; died of smallpox.

<doc id="1235542" wikidata="Q1988987" url="?curid=1235542" title="X-linked recessive inheritance">
<text>X-linked recessive inheritance is a mode of inheritance in which a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome causes the phenotype to be always expressed in males (who are necessarily hemizygous for the gene mutation because they have one X and one Y chromosome) and in females who are homozygous for the gene mutation (see zygosity). Females with one copy of the mutated gene are carriers.

X-linked inheritance means that the gene causing the trait or the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Carrier females who have only one copy of the mutation do not usually express the phenotype, although differences in X-chromosome inactivation (known as skewed X-inactivation) can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females, since some cells will express one X allele and some will express the other. The current estimate of sequenced X-linked genes is 499, and the total, including vaguely defined traits, is 983.

== Patterns of inheritance ==

In humans, inheritance of X-linked recessive traits follows a unique pattern made up of three points.
* The first is that affected fathers cannot pass X-linked recessive traits to their sons because fathers give Y chromosomes to their sons. This means that males affected by an X-linked recessive disorder inherited the responsible X chromosome from their mothers.
* Second, X-linked recessive traits are more commonly expressed in males than females. This is due to the fact that males possess only a single X chromosome, and therefore require only one mutated X in order to be affected. Women possess two X chromosomes, and thus must receive two of the mutated recessive X chromosomes (one from each parent). A popular example showing this pattern of inheritance is that of the descendants of Queen Victoria and the blood disease hemophilia.
* The last pattern seen is that X-linked recessive traits tend to skip generations, meaning that an affected grandfather will not have an affected son, but could have an affected grandson through his daughter. Explained further, all daughters of an affected man will obtain his mutated X, and will then be either carriers or affected themselves depending on the mother. The resulting sons will either have a 50% chance of being affected (mother is carrier), or 100% chance (mother is affected). It is because of these percentages that we see males more commonly affected than females.

== Pushback on recessive/dominant terminology ==
A few scholars have suggested discontinuing the use of the terms &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;recessive&quot; when referring to X-linked inheritance. The possession of two X chromosomes in females leads to dosage issues which are alleviated by X-inactivation. Stating that the highly variable penetrance of X-linked traits in females as a result of mechanisms such as skewed X-inactivation or somatic mosaicism is difficult to reconcile with standard definitions of dominance and recessiveness, scholars have suggested referring to traits on the X chromosome simply as &quot;X-linked.&quot;

==Examples==

===Most common===
The most common X-linked recessive disorders are:
* Red–green color blindness, also known as daltonism, which affects roughly 7% to 10% of men and 0.49% to 1% of women. Its relative benignity may explain its commonness.
* Hemophilia A, a blood clotting disorder caused by a mutation of the Factor VIII gene and leading to a deficiency of Factor VIII. It was once thought to be the &quot;royal disease&quot; found in the descendants of Queen Victoria. This is now known to have been Hemophilia B (see below).
* Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, a blood clotting disorder caused by a mutation of the Factor IX gene and leading to a deficiency of Factor IX. It is rarer than hemophilia A. As noted above, it was common among the descendants of Queen Victoria.
* Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is associated with mutations in the dystrophin gene. It is characterized by rapid progression of muscle degeneration, eventually leading to loss of skeletal muscle control, respiratory failure, and death.
* Becker&#x27;s muscular dystrophy, a milder form of Duchenne, which causes slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis.
* X-linked ichthyosis, a form of ichthyosis caused by a hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme. It is fairly rare, affecting one in 2,000 to one in 6,000 males.
* X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), which affects the body&#x27;s ability to fight infection. XLA patients do not generate mature B cells. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) which defends the body from infections (the humoral response). Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections.
* Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which causes nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to a number of causes, most commonly infection or exposure to certain medications, chemicals, or foods. Commonly known as &quot;favism&quot;, as it can be triggered by chemicals existing naturally in broad (or fava) beans.

===Less common disorders===

Theoretically, a mutation in any of the genes on chromosome X may cause disease, but below are some notable ones, with short description of symptoms:
* Adrenoleukodystrophy; leads to progressive brain damage, failure of the adrenal glands, and eventually death.
* Alport syndrome; glomerulonephritis, endstage kidney disease, and hearing loss. A minority of Alport syndrome cases are due to an autosomal recessive mutation in the gene coding for type IV collagen.
* Androgen insensitivity syndrome; variable degrees of undervirilization and/or infertility in XY persons of either sex
* Barth syndrome; metabolism distortion, delayed motor skills, stamina deficiency, hypotonia, chronic fatigue, delayed growth, cardiomyopathy, and compromised immune system.
* Blue cone monochromacy; low vision acuity, color blindness, photophobia, infantile nystagmus.
* Centronuclear myopathy; where cell nuclei are abnormally located in skeletal muscle cells. In CNM the nuclei are located at a position in the center of the cell, instead of their normal location at the periphery.
* Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMTX2-3); disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease.
* Coffin–Lowry syndrome; severe intellectual disability sometimes associated with abnormalities of growth, cardiac abnormalities, and kyphoscoliosis as well as auditory and visual abnormalities.
* Fabry disease; A lysosomal storage disease causing anhidrosis, fatigue, angiokeratomas, burning extremity pain, and ocular involvement.
* Hunter syndrome; potentially causing hearing loss, thickening of the heart valves leading to a decline in cardiac function, obstructive airway disease, sleep apnea, and enlargement of the liver and spleen.
* Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, presenting with hypohidrosis, hypotrichosis, and hypodontia
* Kabuki syndrome (the &quot;KDM6A&quot; variant); multiple congenital anomalies and intellectual disability.
* Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia)
* Lowe syndrome; hydrophthalmia, cataracts, intellectual disabilities, aminoaciduria, reduced renal ammonia production, and vitamin D-resistant rickets
* Menkes disease; sparse and coarse hair, growth failure, and deterioration of the nervous system
* Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome; misshaped nose, brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness
* Nonsyndromic deafness; hearing loss
* Norrie disease; cataracts and leukocoria along with other developmental issues in the eye
* Occipital horn syndrome; deformations in the skeleton
* Ocular albinism; lack of pigmentation in the eye
* Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency; developmental delay and intellectual disability. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen
* Oto-palato-digital syndrome; facial deformities, cleft palate, hearing loss
* Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome; cleft lip and palate with intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism, caused by mutations in the histone demethylase PHF8
* Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome; coarse faces with protruding jaw and tongue, widened nasal bridge, and upturned nasal tip
* Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy&#x27;s disease; muscle cramps and progressive weakness
* Spinal muscular atrophy caused by UBE1 gene mutation; weakness due to loss of the motor neurons of the spinal cord and brainstem
* Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome; eczema, thrombocytopenia, immune deficiency, and bloody diarrhea
* X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID); infections, usually causing death in the first years of life
* X-linked sideroblastic anemia; skin paleness, fatigue, dizziness, and enlarged spleen and liver.

<text>Anthony Scully Earl (April 12, 1936 – February 23, 2023) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician who served as the 41st governor of Wisconsin from 1983 until 1987. Prior to his election as governor, he served as secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Administration and secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in the administration of Governor Patrick Lucey. He also served three terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Marathon County.

==Early life and career==
Earl was born in St. Ignace, Michigan, the son of Ethlynne Julia (Scully) and Russell K. Earl. He graduated from Michigan State University in 1958 and earned a J.D. from the University of Chicago. After four years in the U.S. Navy, including two years as a legal officer, Earl made his way to Wisconsin in 1965. He was the district attorney of Marathon County, Wisconsin from 1965 to 1966, and the city attorney of Wausau, Wisconsin from 1966 to 1969. That year, he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly, filling the seat vacated by David Obey, who was elected a member of the United States House of Representatives.

In 1974, Earl left the Assembly to run for Wisconsin Attorney General, but was defeated in the primary by Bronson La Follette. Upon his defeat, then-Gov. Patrick Lucey named Earl secretary of the Department of Administration. Later, Earl became Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) where his list of accomplishments include addressing the State&#x27;s surface water pollution.

==Governor of Wisconsin==
In 1982, Earl ran for governor when Lee S. Dreyfus unexpectedly declined to run for re-election, and soon the Wisconsin Democratic Party&#x27;s hopes of reclaiming the governor&#x27;s mansion became very real. As head of the state Department of Natural Resources, Earl was well-received as a staunch defender of the environment and a problem-solver. Earl used that reputation to defeat former Acting Governor Martin J. Schreiber (1977–79) in the Democratic primary for governor. Earl went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Terry Jodok Kohler, in a landslide victory.

However, Earl&#x27;s tenure as governor was a challenge from the start. By the time he took office, Wisconsin was marred by a budget deficit of nearly $1 billion and a 12% unemployment rate. Earl signed legislation making the 5% sales tax permanent and also added a 10% surtax on state income tax which was later reduced. Once the state was fiscally sound, Earl passed initiatives improving the environment, education, and equal opportunity. Earl appointed Doris Hanson, the State&#x27;s first female to hold the office of secretary of the Department of Administration and Howard Fuller, the first African-American appointed to a cabinet position heading the Department of Employee Relations. Due to disagreements over healthcare reform, prison staffing, wage freezes, and other matters, Earl&#x27;s relations with state labor Unions soured and made his tenure as governor all the more complicated.

After restoring the state following one of the worst economic predicaments in state history, Governor Earl was ousted after one term. State Assembly Minority Leader Tommy Thompson, a Republican, staunchly opposed Earl&#x27;s policies and was elected in 1986 to the first of four consecutive terms. Earl Bricker wrote an essay, &quot;goodbye to Wisconsin Governor Tony Earl&quot; bemoaning that Tommy Thompson had defeated Earl in the 1986 election, and that his &quot;pro-family&quot; stance may have given him wider demographic appeal than Earl&#x27;s defense of gay and lesbian rights.

==Post-gubernatorial career==
Earl served on the governing board of &quot;Common Cause Wisconsin&quot; from 1995 until 2005. a non-partisan, non-profit citizen&#x27;s lobby affiliated with national Common Cause. In 1990, Earl was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board and served until 1996. CC/WI promotes campaign finance reform, ethics and lobby reform, open meetings laws, voting rights, non-partisan redistricting, and other issues concerning the promotion and maintenance of accountable government. Earl also served on the board of the Chicago-based Joyce Foundation for many years until 2013.

In July 2004, Earl was recognized at the 12th Annual Outreach Awards for his acknowledgment of the needs of the gay and lesbian community during his term in office; he received the organization&#x27;s Political Courage Award. He served on the board of directors of the American Transmission Company which assumed ownership, operation, planning, maintenance, and monitoring of all the electrical transmission assets formerly owned by a number of Wisconsin utility companies, cooperatives, and municipal utilities. He was a past partner in one of the largest law firms (more than 400 lawyers) in Wisconsin, Quarles and Brady.
The Peshtigo River State Forest in Marinette and Oconto counties has been renamed Governor Earl Peshtigo State Forest according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. September 25, 2019, as reported in the Appleton Post-Crescent on September 26, 2019.

==Personal life and death==
Tony Earl married Sheila Rose Coyle of Chicago, in the summer of 1962. They met while he was a student at the University of Chicago Law School. They had four daughters together, and were married for more than 30 years before separating in 1995. Their divorce was finalized in 2003. In 2011, Earl married Jane Nemke.

Earl had a stroke on February 19, 2023, and died four days later, on February 23, at the UW Health University Hospital, 48 days short of his 87th birthday.

<doc id="1235559" wikidata="Q8038394" url="?curid=1235559" title="WriteNow">
<text>WriteNow is a word processor application for the original Apple Macintosh and later computers in the NeXT product line. The application is one of two word processors that were first developed with the goal that they be available at the time of the Mac product launch in 1984, and was the primary word processor for computers manufactured by NeXT. WriteNow was purchased from T/Maker by WordStar in 1993, but shortly after that, WordStar merged with SoftKey, which ultimately led to its discontinuation. It had a combination of powerful features, excellent performance, and small system requirements.

==History==
WriteNow was written for Apple Computer, Inc., by John Anderson and Bill Tschumy in Seattle, separate from the Macintosh computer and MacWrite word processor development teams. Steve Jobs was concerned that those programming MacWrite were not going to be ready for the 1984 release date of the Macintosh; Apple Computer therefore commissioned a team of programmers, friends of Apple engineer Bud Tribble, to work independently on a similar project, which eventually became WriteNow. Members of the WriteNow team knew about MacWrite, but members of the MacWrite team did not know about WriteNow.

Ultimately, MacWrite was completed on schedule and shipped with the Macintosh. This left WriteNow in limbo until Jobs left Apple to form NeXT and bought Solaster Software which was started by John Anderson, Bill Tschumy and Christopher Stinson. John and Bill, the authors of WriteNow, joined NeXT. WriteNow marketing rights ended up being owned by NeXT, and WriteNow released for the Macintosh in 1985, published by the T/Maker Company.

In October 1988, WriteNow 2.0 was released on Macintosh, adding dictionaries, character / word / paragraph count, import and export of RTF and MacWrite files, and updated compatibility with recent system enhancements. Version 3.0 introduced style sheets.

==Features==
WriteNow improved on some of the limitations of MacWrite through the better handling of large documents and the addition of features such as spell check and footnotes. It was &quot;lean and fast,&quot; being written entirely in assembly language, and it was suited for Macintosh users with only 400 KB floppy disk. WriteNow went through several versions culminating (in 1993) with version 4.0.2, which continued the &quot;lean and fast&quot; reputation while adding features such as tables.

In the opinion of many of its users, WriteNow represented the ideal Macintosh application. It had a simple, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), no copy protection, and it worked in practically every revision of the Macintosh operating system, including in the Mac 68k emulator on PowerPC Macs and in the Classic Environment under Mac OS X. Its biggest claim to fame, however, was its speed. It was written in assembly language (Motorola 680x0) by a group of developers who had a reputation for producing extremely efficient code. The user interface was unusual in that, while the typical word processor had a ruler embedded in the main document window, WriteNow used a separate, fixed window that could be sent into the background, freeing screen space on the compact Mac&#x27;s small nine-inch screen to display an additional line or two of text.

==NeXT port==
Early on WriteNow was ported to the NeXT operating system and was subsequently bundled with NeXT workstations.

Due to concerns of third-party publishers such as WordPerfect over the issue of competing with a free word processor, it was unbundled 1 October 1991 and ownership transferred to Appsoft, which sold it as shrink-wrapped software. From that time, NeXTSTEP shipped without a full-featured word processing program. WriteNow for NeXT became available for sale on October 15 for $199.

WriteNow was written in Motorola 68k assembly language, upon which the NeXT hardware was based.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in 1987 wrote that &quot;&quot;WriteNow&quot; is the Pegasus of Macintosh word processors—swift, easy to learn and use, and packed with power&quot;.

&quot;MacUser&quot; gave WriteNow 2.0 for Macintosh a 4 mice (out of 5) in the August 1989 issue, pitting it against MacWrite II. It praised the speed of the application, while criticizing the complexity of the multi-column formatting. WriteNow won MacUser&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Choice Award for Best New Word Processor in 1986 and 1988.

==Discontinuation==
Around 1993, rights to WriteNow (for both Macintosh and NeXT operating systems) were purchased by WordStar. Shortly after that, WordStar merged with SoftKey, and WriteNow was later discontinued. The lifecycle of computers using the 680x0 architecture was coming to an end, and the architecture-specific assembly language code that made WriteNow so much faster than its competitors also made it much more difficult to port to the new PowerPC processor than competing word processors written in high-level languages such as C.

<text>The Aures Mountains (, known in antiquity as ) are a subrange of the Saharan Atlas in northeastern Algeria. The mountain range gives its name to the mountainous natural and historical region of the Aurès.

==Geography==
The Aures mountains are the eastern continuation of the Saharan Atlas. The highest peak in the Aurès mountain range is Djebel Chélia in Khenchela Province, which sits at .

The Belezma Range is a northwestern prolongation of the Aures Mountains located where the Tell Atlas and the Saharan Atlas come together. Its main summits are high Djebel Refaâ and high Djebel Tichaou. The Atlas chain of mountains extends over 1000 kilometers in total over Northern Africa.

==History==

Historically, the Aures served as a refuge and bulwark for the Berber tribes, forming a base of resistance against the Romans, Vandals, Byzantine, and Arabs along the centuries.

The mountain area was also a district of French Algeria that existed during and after the Algerian War of Independence from 1954 to 1962. It was in this region that the Algerian War of Independence was started by Berber freedom fighters. The rugged terrain of the Aures makes it still one of the least developed areas in the Maghreb.

==Population==
In eastern Algeria, the &quot;Aures&quot; is a large Berber-speaking region, home of the Chaoui people. The Chaoui eastern Berber population practices traditional transhumance, farming fixed stone terraces in the mountains where they grow sorghum, as well as other grains and vegetables. Seasonally they move their cattle to relatively warm areas in the lowland valleys where they pitch tents or live in other temporary structures and tend livestock through the winter.

<text>The Saharan Atlas () is a range of the Atlas Mountain System. It is located mainly in Algeria, with its eastern end in Tunisia. Although not as tall as the High Atlas of Morocco its summits are more imposing than the Tell Atlas range that runs parallel closer to the coast. The tallest peak in the range is the high Djebel Aissa in the Ksour Range.

==Geography==
The Saharan Atlas includes a series of subranges: the Ksour Range in the west, the Amour Range in its central and the Ouled-Naïl Range at its eastern end. It also includes the Aurès (Belezma), the Hodna Mountains, the Nememcha Range and the Zab Mountains. The Tell Atlas and the Saharan Atlas merge in the east to join together into the Tébessa Range and the Medjerda Mountains.

Bordered in the north by the &quot;Hautes Plaines&quot;, the Saharan Atlas is one of the vast plateaux of Africa, formed of ancient base rock covered by the sediment of shallow seas and alluvial deposits.

Among the rivers of the Atlas, the Saharan Atlas feeds wadis. Among these are the &quot;Chelif&quot; and &quot;Touil&quot; wadis, riverbeds that contains water only during wet periods, respectively draining the &quot;Amour&quot; and &quot;Ouled-Naïl&quot; ranges of the Saharan Atlas.

The Saharan Atlas Mountains mark the northern edge of the Sahara Desert. The mountains see some rainfall and are better suited to agriculture than the plateau region to the north. Today most of the population of the region are Chaoui Berbers. The mountains have also long been home to exiles expelled from the fertile coastal regions.

<text>Mark Regan MBE (born 28 January 1972 in Bristol) is an English former rugby union player. Nicknamed &#x27;Ronnie&#x27;, he played as a hooker for Bristol, Bath, Leeds Tykes as well as England and the British and Irish Lions.

==Career==
Regan&#x27;s England breakthrough came when he succeeded Brian Moore in 1995 for the visit of South Africa to Twickenham in November. He became the first player to make his England debut in the professional era of rugby union, which began in August of that year. Despite being on the losing side, he retained his place for the 1996 and 1997 Five Nations championships.

Selected for the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, he was kept out of the first and second tests by Keith Wood, but played in the final test.

He lost form on his return from Lions duty and lost his England place to new club mate Andy Long and then Richard Cockerill. Even though he played a major role in Bath&#x27;s Heineken Cup victory over Brive in Bordeaux, the hooker was out of favour with England Coach Clive Woodward.

In 1999/2000, Regan re-emerged as a player: he shed over a stone in weight and hit back at critics who believed his line-out throwing was too inconsistent for international level by turning in some impressive performances for Bath. A prominent figure in the clubs late season challenge for the Allied Dunbar Premiership, he was voted the Bath forward of the year.

Regan returned to the international scene as a training squad member and England A player. He returned to the England squad on the tour to South Africa in 2000. He played some of the best rugby of his career and selection for the autumn internationals followed. Phil Greening&#x27;s knee and hand injuries allowed him to take over as England&#x27;s number one hooker for the Six Nations Championship; however, Clive Woodward opted for Leicester Tigers Dorian West and Regan was forced to sit on the bench for most of the campaign.

Though he missed out on the Lions tour to Australia during the summer, Regan was selected for England&#x27;s summer tour. However, hindered by his injury, Regan struggled to find his early season form. He remained part of the England set-up for the 2001-2002 season and again went on tour in the summer to Argentina.

Regan joined Leeds Tykes in August 2002 from Bath and quickly became a central figure at Headingley. He made his debut on the opening day of the 2002-2003 season in a 26-13 win over Leicester Tigers. After moving to Leeds his displays not only saw him become a crowd favourite but also saw a revival in his international career, as he was selected for the England squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

Regan announced his international retirement in 2004 after not being selected for the game against Canada. He left Leeds at the end of the 2004-05 season having helped secure Leeds Premiership status, as well as winning a Powergen Cup winners medal, the final of which he started. He played 69 times for Leeds and scored 6 tries. In 2005-6 he was instrumental in helping newly promoted Bristol (his hometown club) retain their Premiership status. He came out of international retirement in 2007 and was impressive in England&#x27;s otherwise lacklustre tour of South Africa. Consequently, he was named in the England squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He was also named in the England squad for the 2008 Six Nations Championship alongside Leicester&#x27;s George Chuter and Bath&#x27;s Lee Mears.

After the world cup, Regan was selected to captain the Barbarians against but was refused permission to play from Bristol. However, Regan ignored the club and played the game anyway.

After England beat France 24-13 in Paris in the 2008 Six Nations Championship, Regan was described by French coach Marc Lièvremont as a &#x27;grotesque clown&#x27;. This was to be Regan&#x27;s last appearance for England.

In February 2009, Regan announced his intention to retire at the end of the season.

He is now Forwards Coach at Clifton Rugby Club playing a part in leading them to the South West One title and the EDF Cup Final at Twickenham.

He is also currently involved in the buy-to-let property market, working with property investment companies Midas Estates and Property Investment Plan.

<text>Peter Barry Ryan (10 June 1940 – 2 July 1962) was an American-born Canadian racecar driver from Mont-Tremblant, Quebec. He had a short Formula One career. He participated in one Grand Prix, the 1961 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, finishing ninth. He scored no championship points. However, he became the first Canadian ever to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix.

==Career==
Ryan first came to prominence as a skier, winning the National Ski Association&#x27;s junior downhill championship at Mount Rose, Nevada, in 1957. &quot;Immediately after Ryan&#x27;s victory, Americans protested that Canadians could not win an American championship.&quot; The protest was disallowed. His Olympic prospects were such that a dispute arose as to which country he should represent. The Americans asserted that he: &quot;was born in the United States as were his father, the late Joseph P. Ryan, and his mother.&quot; Ryan expressed a preference for the Canadian team: &quot;But while he would like to ski for Canada, he wouldn&#x27;t care to give up his American citizenship.&quot; &quot;An outstanding skier, Ryan shifted to auto racing in 1959 after a ski crackup in which both his legs were broken.&quot;

On 25 April 1959, Denise McCluggage, writing in &quot;Competition Press&quot;, reported: &quot;Peter Ryan of the Mont Tremblant Ryans bought Bernie Vihl&#x27;s beautifully kept old 550 Porsche in which to take up racing-sports car racing that is. Peter at 19, is an old hand at ski racing being a downhill expert.&quot; Ryan&#x27;s successes came in sports cars racing in Canada, the US and Nassau. On 1 October 1960, Ryan co-drove with Roger Penske in a Porsche RS60 to win the six-hour Sundown Grand Prix at Harewood, in Ontario, Canada. The next week Ryan was entered in the 230-mile Formula Libre road race at Watkins Glen, New York. In qualifying he was &quot;the surprise of the day, taking the fifth position over England&#x27;s Roy Salvadori.&quot; Ahead of him were Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Joakim Bonnier and Olivier Gendebien. He was driving Bill Sadler&#x27;s Formula Libre special, known as &quot;Formula Ferocious,&quot; a rear-engined single-seater device, when his motor blew on lap 56.

At Sebring on 25 March 1961, Ryan, teamed with Frances Bradley and Ludwig Heimrath, finished eighth overall in the Florida International 12-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance, driving a Porsche RS. In June 1961 Ryan withdrew from a race at Mosport. He &quot;was expected to give Moss his stiffest competition, but did not compete. He withdrew at the last minute. Ryan, a member of the Sports Car Club of America, feared he would lose his amateur status in the United States if he entered the race.
The S.C.C.A. ordered its members not to compete in the Canadian race because prize money was being given.&quot; In July 1961 Peter Ryan (Comstock Sadler-Chevrolet) was leading the Meadowdale Grand Prix when Roger Penske (Maserati birdcage &quot;Telar Special&quot;): &quot;banged into him from the rear on the 18th lap.&quot; Ryan clung on to the lead, but after spinning recovered to finish second. On 6 August 1961, Ryan won the Vanderbilt Cup for Formula Junior cars at Bridgehampton, New York, driving a Lotus 20, averaging 87.95 miles an hour.

Ryan was the winner of the inaugural Canadian Grand Prix, in a Lotus Monte Carlo-Climax, held at Mosport on 30 September 1961, when it was a non-Championship sports car race. Second that day was Pedro Rodriguez (Ferrari V12) and third Stirling Moss (Lotus Monte Carlo). The win at Mosport led to an invitation from Colin Chapman to drive a Lotus in the 1961 United States Grand Prix.

In the first 3-hr Daytona Continental GT and sports car race at Daytona on 11 February 1962, Ryan finished 15th overall, sharing a Ferrari 3.0-litre with Ricardo Rodriguez. The previous day he had finished fifth in the Lurani Trophy Race for Formula Junior cars, driving a Lotus 20. At Sebring on 24 March 1962, Ryan, teamed with John Fulp, finished thirteenth overall in the Florida International 12-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance, driving a Ferrari 248 SP for the North American Racing Team.

An offer of a factory-Lotus Formula Junior drive in Europe for 1962 did not materialise: &quot;The young Canadian-American, bitterly disappointed, has gone to England to see what arrangements can be made for the coming season.&quot; &quot;Placed under a three-year contract by Team Lotus he was lent to the Ian Walker Racing Team for the 1962 season..&quot; On 27 May 1962, Ryan was teamed with Paul Hawkins in an Ian Walker Racing Team Lotus 23 at the Nurburgring 1,000 km sports car race. The car suffered from overheating and was unplaced. At Monaco on 2 June 1962, Ryan won a heat race in an FJ Lotus, finishing eleventh in the final. Denis Jenkinson commented: &quot;The driving of Ryan, the Canadian, and Spence, both in Ian Walker Lotus-Juniors, was very impressive..&quot; At Mallory Park, England, on 11 June 1962, Ryan drove an FJ Lotus: &quot;The Formula Junior event saw Peter Ryan adding to his growing reputation in Europe by tailing Peter Arundell&#x27;s works Lotus for the whole race, then nipping through on lap 28 to win by a second.&quot;

Ryan made his Le Mans debut on 23 and 24 June 1962, partnered by John &#x27;Buck&#x27; Fulp, driving the #18 NART Ferrari 250 TRI/61. The car completed 150 laps and 15 hours when it was crashed by Ryan. &quot;Poor Peter Ryan put his Ferrari in the sandbank at Mulsanne and dug for ages before giving up..&quot;

Ryan&#x27;s last race was in the &quot;Coupe Internationale des Juniors&quot; Formula Junior race at Rheims, on 2 July 1962. &quot;First of the heats, run at 10 a.m. round an almost deserted circuit, began as a terrific scrap between Peter Ryan&#x27;s Ian Walker Lotus, Bill Moss&#x27;s Gemini, Gardner&#x27;s Brabham with Love&#x27;s Cooper and Arundell&#x27;s Lotus lurking just behind. This struggle continued until the 5th lap, when Ryan&#x27;s Lotus and Bill Moss&#x27;s Gemini touched as they left the very fast right-hand bend past Gueux. Both cars left the road at high speed and were totally wrecked; Bill Moss escaped with minor injuries but Ryan was taken to hospital seriously hurt.&quot; He succumbed to his injuries in a Paris hospital where he was taken following the accident.

Peter Garnier, writing in &quot;Autocar&quot;, said of Peter Ryan: &quot;During his all too-brief-spell on British and Continental circuits, he had proved himself to be extremely skilful and fast, with just that touch of fire which can often indicate the makings of a great driver.&quot;

Peter Ryan was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame as one of the initial inductees in 1993.

<doc id="1235574" wikidata="Q172429" url="?curid=1235574" title="Peter Westbury">
<text>Peter Westbury (26 May 1938 – 7 December 2015) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, scoring no championship points. In 1969 he raced a Formula 2 Brabham-Cosworth, driving in his first Grand Prix in the 1969 German Grand Prix. He finished ninth on the road, fifth in the F2 class. The following year he failed to qualify for the 1970 United States Grand Prix driving a works BRM, after an engine failure.

Early in his racing career he campaigned a homebuilt special called the M.G.W., graduating to a Cooper-Climax in 1960 which was later fitted with a Daimler V8 engine. Westbury won the British Hill Climb Championship twice, in 1963 and 1964. In 1963 he drove the self-built Felday, with supercharged Daimler V8 2.6-litre motor. The following year he won in the 2.5-litre Climax-engined Ferguson P99 with four-wheel-drive, on loan from Ferguson Research Ltd. Westbury also drove the Ferguson P99 in the 1964 Brighton Speed Trials and at the First International Drag Festival, a series of six events held in England that year, where the car covered the standing-start quarter mile in 11.01 seconds. He also drove a Lotus 23-BRM sports car at the Drag Festival.

During 1965 Westbury developed the Felday-BRM 4 sports car with four-wheel-drive. The car won on its debut at Brands Hatch on Boxing Day, 26 December 1965, driven by Mac Daghorn. At Mallory Park on 13 March 1966, Peter Westbury and Mac Daghorn shared the car, each winning a race. Jim Clark raced the Felday 4 in the Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch on 29 August 1966. The Felday 5 sports car was fitted with a 7-litre Ford Galaxie engine and four wheel drive, but only raced briefly. The Felday 6 was a 4.7-litre Ford-powered hillclimb single-seater, with rear wheel drive, built for Tony Griffiths.

In 1967 Westbury raced a Brabham-Ford Formula Three car in England and in Continental Europe. He won the F3 race at the Silverstone circuit on 29 April, the Grand Prix des Frontières at Chimay on 14 May, and also at the Auvergne Trophy meeting on 18 June 1967, on the daunting Clermont-Ferrand circuit in France. The same year he resuscitated the old BRM P67 four-wheel-drive F1 car, designed by Mike Pilbeam in 1964, for David Good to campaign in the British Hill Climb Championship. The car led the series at the half-way mark, but then passed into the hands of Peter Lawson, who revamped it for 1968. The car was a dominant winner of the series in 1968.

<text>Piero Carini (March 6, 1921 – May 30, 1957) was a racing driver from Italy. He was born in Genoa and died in Saint-Étienne, France.

==Racing career==
Carini finished third in the 1950 Modena Grand Prix, run that year to Formula Two rules, driving an OSCA. However, the car proved unreliable in 1951 but he achieved enough to be invited to join Scuderia Marzotto for 1952, to drive their Ferrari sports and Grand Prix cars. Despite only competing in two Grands Prix (debuting on 6 July 1952) and retiring from both, Carini did well enough to be signed by the works Ferrari team for 1953, effectively as a &quot;junior&quot; driver alongside Umberto Maglioli. However he only competed in the Italian Grand Prix and at the end of the season moved to Alfa Romeo for 1954, to drive their touring cars achieving class wins in the Mille Miglia, the Tour of Sicily and the Dolomite Cup.

In 1955 Carini drove a Ferrari to class wins at Dakar and Caracas, Venezuela, and an OSCA to a class win in the Targa Florio.

In 1957, driving in a sports car race, near Saint-Étienne, France, with a Ferrari Testa Rossa, Carini&#x27;s car crossed the central reservation and collided with another competitor killing him instantly.

<text>Piero Drogo (born in Vignale Monferrato, Alessandria, 8 August 1926 – died in Bologna, 28 April 1973) was a racing driver and coachbuilder from Italy. He participated in one Formula One Grand Prix, debuting at the 1960 Italian Grand Prix. He moved on to form a &quot;carrozzeria&quot; in Modena to service the thriving sports car industry there. His Carrozzeria Sports Cars gained some fame later in the decade. He died in a car accident aged 46.

== Early life ==
Piero Drogo was born in Vignale Monferrato on 8 August 1926 to father Luigi Drogo and mother Rosina Monzeglio. His parents were farmers. Before or immediately after World War II he moved to Venezuela, along with members of his family. While in Venezuela, he began his career as a sports car racing driver. His first recorded result was at the 1956 Premio Nacional Ciudad de Maracay in Venezuela, where he placed first overall driving a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL.

In 1958, Drogo returned to Italy and began living in Modena, where he would remain for the rest of his life. In the late 1950s, he worked as a racing mechanic for Stanguellini to support his racing career.

Drogo married Anna Pia Fornaciari, a nurse from Modena, on 5 December 1959.

== Racing career ==
The first known record of Drogo&#x27;s racing career is a first-place finish in the 1956 Premio Nacional Ciudad de Maracay, although this may not have been the first event in which he participated. Drogo&#x27;s racing career included numerous regional sports car races in Latin America, as well as international races such as the 1958 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1959 Targa Florio. He also drove in the 1960 Formula One season, including an 8th-place finish at the 1960 Italian Grand Prix as well as several non-championship races. He scored no Formula One championship points.

== Carrozzeria Sports Cars ==
In 1960, Piero Drogo entered into a partnership in the carrozzeria &quot;Marchesini &amp; Cavalieri S.d.f&quot; alongside Lino Marchesini and Celso Cavalieri. This business would become commonly known as Carrozzeria Sports Cars, although it operated under several legal names during its existence. C.S.C. operated from 1960 to late 1971, during which time the company produced low-volume or one-off bodywork for many Italian automakers as well as racing teams and individuals. C.S.C. customers included Scuderia Ferrari, Giotto Bizzarrini, Iso, Scuderia Serenissma, ASA, NART, Ecurie Francorchamps and others.

From the beginning of Carrozzeria Sports Cars, Piero Drogo&#x27;s role was primarily in managing business operations. His duties included sales, public relations and administration. Although the name &quot;Drogo&quot; is often used as a synonym for the designs of C.S.C., Drogo did not practice the craft of coachbuilding nor was he an automobile designer. It is a common misconception that Drogo designed automobile bodies- in fact, the design work was carried out by C.S.C. workers during the fabrication process, often in collaboration with the customer. No single person was responsible for the automobile designs produced by C.S.C. In his role as the manager of C.S.C., Drogo became well known in Modena and used his contacts in the racing world to attract business. While multiple other partners joined and left C.S.C, Drogo&#x27;s presence was a constant from 1960 until the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1971.

By 1971, Carrozzeria Sports Cars was facing financial difficulties. In June 1971, Drogo published an editorial in the magazine &quot;Autosprint&quot; titled &quot;Modena S.O.S.&quot;, which appealed to private and/or public investment to assist C.S.C. and other small Modenese manufacturers facing similar economic troubles. Drogo&#x27;s efforts to save the business were ultimately unsuccessful and C.S.C. declared bankruptcy on 31 December 1971.

== Later life ==
In 1972, Piero Drogo opened a dealership under the name &quot;Sports Cars S.a.s. di Drogo &amp; Vassallo&quot;, selling Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Porsche and De Tomaso automobiles. This was located on the former premises of Carrozzeria Sports Cars and shared premises with &quot;Carrozzeria ABS&quot;, which was founded by former C.S.C. employees. In this way, Drogo maintained some continuity of business operations despite the bankruptcy of C.S.C.

Piero Drogo died on 28 April 1973, at the age of 46, in an automobile accident. He collided with a truck while driving through a dark tunnel near Bologna. A lengthy obituary by journalist Mario Morselli was published in &quot;Autosprint&quot;.

Drogo&#x27;s widow, Anna Pia Fornaciari, would later marry Lamborghini test driver and development engineer Bob Wallace.

<text>Benjamin Mink (born January 22, 1951) is a Canadian songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer best known as a longtime collaborator of Canadian singer k.d. lang. He plays several string instruments, notably the guitar, violin, and the mandolin.

==Early life, family, and education==
Born to Polish Holocaust survivors, Mink was raised in Toronto, Canada. 

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Mink began performing with the rock/country group Mary-Lou Horner, which became the house band at the Rockpile bar and nightclub and acted as a backup band for Chuck Berry.

He has been a member of the groups Stringband, Murray McLauchlan&#x27;s Silver Tractors, and FM.

===With k.d. lang===
Mink is best known as a longtime collaborator of Canadian singer k.d. lang, whom he met at Expo &#x27;85 while doing a gig with CANO. He has performed on, along with co-writing and producing, several of her albums, which often combine voice with string arrangements. Mink subsequently performed as violinist, guitarist, and mandolinist with lang&#x27;s band, the Reclines. A performance for the Grammy-nominated album &quot;Ingénue&quot; was recorded as part of the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series at the Ed Sullivan Theater, New York City, on December 16, 1992. Mink was interviewed about his songwriting collaboration with lang on the British television show &quot;South Bank Show&quot; in 1996.

===With Rush===
Mink was invited to play electric violin on the Rush song &quot;Losing It&quot;, from their 1982 album, &quot;Signals&quot;. He also contributed strings to the song &quot;Faithless&quot; from the 2007 album, &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot;. He also co-wrote, produced, and played guitar on &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot; (2000), a solo project of Rush lead singer and bassist, Geddy Lee.
On June 19, 2015, he performed &quot;Losing It&quot; with the trio at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, as part of their farewell R40 Live Tour.

===Other collaborations===
Mink has also produced and/or performed on recordings by Barenaked Ladies, Anne Murray, Dan Hill, Mendelson Joe, Prairie Oyster, Raffi, Jane Siberry, Ian and Sylvia Tyson, Valdy, Bruce Cockburn, Murray McLauchlan, Willie P. Bennett, Susan Aglukark, Methodman, Alison Krauss, Feist, Daniel Lanois, Sarah McLachlan, Roy Orbison, Elton John, and Heart.

He co-produced &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot; for Heart&#x27;s Ann and Nancy Wilson, released in the fall of 2010, and appeared onstage in the band&#x27;s concert video &quot;Night at Sky Church&quot;. Mink was back at the helm as producer of Heart&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Fanatic&quot;, which included the single &quot;Walkin&#x27; Good&quot;, featuring Sarah McLachlan.

Mink co-produced and performed on Feist&#x27;s Grammy-nominated hit single &quot;1234&quot;, playing strings and guitars.

He is a member of Black Sea Station, a North American klezmer supergroup. Their debut recording, &quot;Transylvania Avenue&quot;, is produced by Mink, and was released on Rounder Records in the Fall of 2010 as a digital download. He has also produced other klezmer musical acts in the past, such as Finjan, the Klezmatics, and Chava Alberstein.

===Soundtracks===
Mink scored the 2007 biopic &quot;Confessions of an Innocent Man&quot; about British-Canadian engineer William Sampson, which garnered him a Gemini Award.
He wrote the soundtrack to the film &quot;Fifty Dead Men Walking&quot;, which has since received numerous awards and nominations, including a 2010 Genie Award nomination for Best Achievement in Music—Original Score, and a 2009 Leo Award for Best Musical Score for a Feature-Length Drama. The television soundtracks for &quot;Terminal City&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot; both also garnered
Leo Awards.
In 2011, the TV series &quot;Glee&quot; used the 1992 song &quot;Constant Craving&quot;, written by Mink and k.d. lang, in the seventh episode of the third season, for its closing number (performed by Chris Colfer, Idina Menzel and Naya Rivera).

===Other work===
Mink has lectured on such topics as &quot;The Music Business vs. the Creative Process&quot; at the University of British Columbia, Western Washington University, and Simon Fraser University. He has also worked with students as an associate of UBC&#x27;s Department of Mechanical Engineering (robotics) and is an associate member of the Institute for Computing, Information &amp; Cognitive Systems. In 2006, he delivered the introductory speech to k.d. lang&#x27;s Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award induction at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. He has also contributed to the Library and Archives Canada.

Mink is one of few people to ever share a songwriting credit with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. In 1997, Mink and k.d. lang were co-credited as songwriters on the Rolling Stones single &quot;Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot; because Jagger-Richards felt the chorus was similar to &quot;Constant Craving&quot;.

Mink has one solo recording—the 1980 release &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot;, on Passport Records.

==Selected awards==
* Grammy Awards: In 1990, Mink was co-nominated with k.d. lang for a Best Country Song Grammy for &quot;Luck in My Eyes&quot;. Subsequently, as a producer and writer, he has been nominated for a total of nine Grammies, winning twice for his work with lang.
* Juno Awards: He has received seven Juno nominations, winning three times between 1993 and 1994.
* Genie/Gemini Awards: Genie Award – Best Original Score for &quot;50 Dead Men Walking&quot;; Gemini Award – Best British Columbia Film for &quot;Confessions of an Innocent Man&quot;.

<doc id="1235579" wikidata="Q231409" url="?curid=1235579" title="Marie Adélaïde of Savoy">
<text>Marie Adélaïde of Savoy (6 December 1685 – 12 February 1712) was the wife of Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy. She was the eldest daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, and of Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans. Her betrothal to the Duke of Burgundy in June 1696 was part of the Treaty of Turin, signed on 29 August 1696. She was the mother of the future King Louis XV of France. Styled as Duchess of Burgundy after her marriage, she became Dauphine of France upon the death of her father-in-law, Le Grand Dauphin, in 1711. She died of measles in 1712, followed by her husband a week later.

==Early life and background==

Born at the Royal Palace of Turin in December 1685, Marie Adélaïde was the eldest daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, since 1675 and his French wife Anne Marie d&#x27;Orléans, a niece of Louis XIV, and the daughter of Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, and of Henrietta of England. Her birth nearly cost her sixteen-year-old mother her life. As a female, she was not eligible to inherit the Duchy of Savoy due to salic law. Her grandmother Marie Jeanne of Savoy and the Prince of Carignan acted as godparents. Marie Adélaïde enjoyed a particularly close relationship with her grandmother as well as her mother who, despite protocol, was raising her children herself, which was quite unusual among royalty during the era. As children, she and her sister Maria Luisa frequented the &quot;Vigno di Madama&quot; outside Turin, and paid weekly visits to their grandmother at the &quot;Palazzo Madama&quot; in Turin.

Marie Adelaide was tiny, even described as &quot;doll-sized.&quot; Her hair was chestnut in her youth, and darkened as she grew up. Her eyes were large and black, surrounded by long eyelashes.

==Betrothal and marriage==

The marriage of Marie Adélaïde came as a result of the Treaty of Turin signed on 29 August 1696. This treaty between her father and Louis XIV agreed that her father would support France in the Nine Years&#x27; War. Her father&#x27;s dominions had been ravaged during the war.

Victor Amadeus had first proposed Marie Adélaïde as a candidate for marriage with the Archduke Joseph, but Emperor Leopold I had declined because of their young age. The Treaty of Turin was negotiated under the influence of the Maréchal de Tessé, who suggested that Marie Adelaïde be sent to France to perfect her education before marrying the French prince.

Upon her arrival in France, Louis XIV, who had come to greet her, met her in Montargis on 4 November 1696, and was quite pleased with &quot;the Princess&quot;. As she was still a girl of 11 years, the marriage did not take place immediately. Instead, three days a week, she was a pupil at the Maison royale de Saint-Louis, the girls&#x27; school Madame de Maintenon had founded in 1684 in Saint-Cyr, in the vicinity of Versailles.

On 6 December 1697, on her twelfth birthday, Marie Adelaïde was formally married to the Duke of Burgundy in the Palace of Versailles. The event took place after the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick which ended the Nine Years&#x27; War. Her husband was the eldest son of Le Grand Dauphin and Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria.

==Duchess of Burgundy==

The new Duchess of Burgundy had a close relationship with the king and with Madame de Maintenon. Her arrival in Versailles was described &quot;like a breath of fresh air,&quot; reviving the dull court. She also maintained an ongoing correspondence with her parents and grandmother back in Savoy.

Louis de Rouvroy in his memoirs, depicts the dauphine as an accomplished woman at court, full of spirit and energy.

She used her influence over the aging king to prevent her political enemies from furthering their causes. This group, known as the &quot;cabale de Meudon&quot;, devoted themselves to her father-in-law, hoping to secure themselves in his expected reign upon the death of Louis XIV. Her great enemy was the Duchess of Bourbon, a legitimated daughter of Louis XIV and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. The Duchess of Bourbon wanted her daughter &quot;Mademoiselle de Bourbon&quot; to wed Charles, Duke of Berry, youngest son of the &quot;Grand Dauphin&quot;. To maintain her influence over her grandfather-in-law, the Duchess of Burgundy organized Berry&#x27;s marriage to Marie Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, the eldest daughter of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans and of his wife Françoise Marie de Bourbon. The influential Marie Adélaïde also brought about the disgrace of Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme, the great military man of the era.

The Duchess of Burgundy gave birth to her first child in 1704. The child, a short-lived boy, was given the title Duke of Brittany before his death in 1705. Marie Adélaïde bore two more children in 1707 and 1710. Her youngest son, the only child to survive beyond childhood, later became King Louis XV of France.

==Dauphine of France==
In early April 1711, her father-in-law &quot;Le Grand Dauphin&quot; caught smallpox and died on 14 April at the Château de Meudon. Upon the death of &quot;Le Grand Dauphin&quot;, Marie Adélaïde&#x27;s husband became Dauphin of France and she Dauphine of France.

The mourning court traveled to Fontainebleau in February 1712. At Fontainebleau, Marie Adélaïde caught a fever which escalated in measles. Having been bled and given emetics, she died in Versailles at the age of 26. Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon were plunged into sadness. &quot;Madame&quot; later said that Marie Adélaïde was one of only two persons Louis XIV had ever truly loved in his life, the other being Anne of Austria, the king&#x27;s mother. After the Dauphine&#x27;s death, the royal family moved to Marly to avoid the spread of infection. It was at Marly that the Dauphin himself died six days later, having caught the measles from his wife.

The couple was buried together at the Basilica of Saint Denis on 23 February 1712. Their son, the Duke of Brittany succeeded as Dauphin, but he died the following March from the measles. The only child to survive the epidemic was the future Louis XV who was locked inside his apartments with his governess Madame de Ventadour to avoid being bled to death by doctors like his elder brother had been. Madame de Ventadour was renowned for having saved the infant Louis XV&#x27;s life. Louis XV subsequently named his fourth daughter &quot;Marie Adélaïde&quot; in his mother&#x27;s honour.

The Dauphine was the subject of a statue held at the Louvre in which she posed as the Roman goddess Diana which was crafted by Antoine Coysevox in 1710.

<text>Frederick &quot;Rikky&quot; von Opel (born 14 October 1947) is a former racing driver, who competed under the Liechtenstein flag in Formula One from to . Von Opel remains the only driver to represent Liechtenstein in Formula One.

Born in New York City and raised in St. Moritz, von Opel was born into the noble Opel family as the son of Fritz von Opel and the great-grandson of Adam Opel, founder of Opel. He won the Lombard North British Formula 3 Championship in 1972. Von Opel participated in 14 Formula One Grands Prix for Ensign and Brabham, debuting with the former at the 1973 French Grand Prix. He finished a career-best ninth at the Swedish and Dutch Grands Prix in with Brabham, driving the Brabham BT44.

Upon retiring from motor racing, von Opel moved to a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, becoming a monk.

==Racing career==
Von Opel started out racing in Formula Ford in 1970, under the pseudonym &quot;Antonio Branco&quot;. After his year in Formula Ford, he moved on to Formula 3, where he competed for two years. He raced a Lotus 69 in 1971 in the BRSCC Shell British Formula 3 series (six starts, one pole position, eight points), but changed over to Ensign Racing in 1972 and followed the team into Formula One. He won the 1972 Lombard North Formula 3 championship, one of three concurrent regional championships (along with the &quot;John Player&quot;, and &quot;Forward Trust&quot;) in the United Kingdom.

==Formula One==
===1973===

Opel&#x27;s Formula One debut coincided with that of the team that provided him with his big break, Ensign. Both began at Paul Ricard in France, the eighth race of the 1973 season, with Opel qualifying his N173 25th and finishing 15th, three laps down. Great Britain was next, while Opel finished 13th, six laps down, after starting from 21st.

More promising signs appeared to be on the horizon at Zandvoort for the Dutch Grand Prix where he qualified a very creditable 14th, ahead of former World Drivers&#x27; Champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Graham Hill. However, on the morning of the race, cracks were found in the chassis. With too little time to make repairs, Opel was unable to start and the same issues prevented the team from starting in Germany too. Fuel system issues curtailed Opel&#x27;s Austrian Grand Prix where he qualified 19th, and an overheating engine ended his Italian Grand Prix, after qualifying 17th.

The North American climax offered little better; he qualified 26th and last in Canada and was unclassified in the race, finishing 12 laps down, whilst in that year&#x27;s United States Grand Prix he once again qualified dead last, 27th, and retired on the opening lap with his throttle jammed open. Opel&#x27;s debut season produced no points, and he was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===1974===
Ensign&#x27;s car for the new season, the N174, was much like the N173, but at the opening round of 1974 in Argentina, Opel discovered how little progress had really been made. He qualified 26th, again dead last, more than seven seconds slower than pole-sitter Ronnie Peterson and almost one and a half seconds slower than Guy Edwards, who qualified 25th. The handling of the car was so flawed that he chose to withdraw from the meeting. Shortly afterwards Opel quit the team.

He sat out the races in the Brazilian Grand Prix and South Africa until he took over the second Brabham seat from Richard Robarts, starting with the Spanish Grand Prix. Their BT44 was powered by the same Cosworth DFV V8 as the Ensign, but the chassis was far superior, so hopes were raised.
However, Opel could not make the most of it and he struggled to match the performance of new teammate, Argentine Carlos Reutemann.

Retiring with an oil leak in Spain, after qualifying 24th, and again a fortnight later in Belgium with a blown engine, from which he started 22nd, were not the lift in performance Opel wished for. Monaco was worse still, where he was the only driver that failed to qualify. Brief respite was found in Sweden and the Netherlands with his first top-10 finishes, 9th on both occasions (after qualifying 20th and 23rd respectively).

The promise was short-lived though, as failure to qualify next time out in France was the final straw for Brabham boss Bernie Ecclestone, and Opel was replaced by Carlos Pace. For the second year running he was unclassified in the Driver&#x27;s Championship with no points. A little over a year after his debut, the career of Liechtenstein&#x27;s only Formula One driver was over.

==Personal life==
He is the son of Fritz von Opel and a great-grandson of Adam Opel, the founder of the German car-maker Opel. His mother is von Opel&#x27;s second wife, Emita Herrán Olozaga, the daughter of a Colombian diplomat. He was born in the United States and lived in St. Moritz, Switzerland during his youth - often secretly challenging his cousin Gunter Sachs and friend Alexander Onassis to flat-out midnight bobsled runs at the St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun. He chose to represent Liechtenstein in racing despite having no connection to the country, and proclaimed before one of his Grands Prix that &quot;When I win, I want to hear the German national anthem&quot;.

After his stint in Formula One, von Opel retired to a Buddhist monastery in rural Thailand and became a monk. His exact whereabouts are unknown and his only contact with the outside world comes in the form of a post office box, the location of which is known by only a select few of his acquaintances.

<text>Robert La Caze (, ; 26 February 1917 – 1 July 2015) was a Moroccan and French racing driver, who competed under the Moroccan flag in Formula One at the in . La Caze remains the only Moroccan driver to compete in Formula One. In rallying, La Caze was a two-time winner of the Rallye du Maroc in 1954 and 1967.

Born in Paris and raised in Morocco, La Caze started his career in rallying across North Africa, also winning a national title in skiing. Following World War II, La Caze competed in sportscar racing, finishing third at the 12 Hours of Casablanca in 1952, and winning the 3 Hours of Safi the following year. In 1954, La Caze won two classes at the Marrakesh Grand Prix, another class at the Tangier Grand Prix, and won the Rallye du Maroc in a Simca Aronde. He became a class winner at the in 1955, also finishing runner-up in the Rallye that year. In Europe, he further competed in the 1955 Mille Miglia, 1956 Tour de France Automobile and the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans, the latter with Gordini.

La Caze became the first driver to compete in Formula One under an African licence at the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix, entering a Cooper T45 as a privateer and finishing fourteenth in his Formula Two machinery. La Caze returned to Le Mans in and , driving a Porsche 550 and 718, respectively. La Caze won his second Rallye in 1967 in a Renault 8 Gordini. Upon retiring from motor racing the following year, La Caze operated a garage and youth sports organisation in Marrakesh until his death in 2015, aged 98.

==Career==
===Early life===
La Caze was born in Paris, but as the grandson of a French diplomat, he moved to Morocco at a young age and spent most of his life there. He started his motorsport career in rallying, taking part in many events across North Africa. He also became the Moroccan national skiing champion.

===Sportscar races and rallies in Morocco===
International motorsport returned to Morocco after the Second World War in the form of a sportscar race, the . The event was held from 1950 to 1956, each year featuring multiple races for different engine classes. In 1951, he placed third in the S750 race. In 1952, he placed second in the S1.0 race. In 1953, he placed second in the S1.1 and S2.0 races. In 1954, he placed second in the S1.1 race. In 1955, he won the S1.0 race. In 1956, he set the fastest practice time for the S1.3 race but his final result is unclear; he finished 8th in the .

In 1951, La Caze participated in the Rallye du Maroc and finished sixth. In 1952, he finished third in the 12 Hours of Casablanca. In 1953, he won the 3 Hours of Safi and started the 3 Hours of Algeria and 12 Hours of Casablanca, but his result in either race is unclear. 1954 was particularly successful: he won the S1.1 and S1.5 races at the Marrakech Grand Prix, the S1.6 race at the Tangier Grand Prix, and the Rallye du Maroc for the first time. He was runner-up in the rally in 1955. Outside of Morocco, La Caze raced in the 1955 Mille Miglia, the 1956 Tour de France and the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans.

===Moroccan Grand Prix===
The Moroccan Grand Prix returned in 1957, but it was run to Formula One regulations and local competitors could not afford to enter. The event organisers remedied this for the 1958 event, allowing Formula Two cars to enter in a separate class. La Caze secured an F2 entry with a privately owned Cooper. He lacked open-wheel racing experience, but impressed in practice by lapping within two seconds of the F2 class leaders. He qualified fourth out of the F2 entries and steadily improved his pace throughout the race, making a late pass on André Guelfi to secure third in the F2 class and 14th overall. However, the race was marred by Stuart Lewis-Evans&#x27;s accident which ultimately proved to be fatal, and the Moroccan Grand Prix would not return.

===Last races and later career===
La Caze raced four times alongside Jean Kerguen, who had also been part of the Moroccan Grand Prix F2 field. In 1959, they competed at Le Mans and the Tour de France, finishing fourth overall in the latter. In 1960, they drove to 14th overall in the Rally Isla de Gran Canaria before returning to Le Mans. La Caze won the Rallye du Maroc for the second time in 1967, and drove again in 1968 but retired with an accident.

Following his motorsport career, La Caze ran a garage and a youth sports association in Marrakech. He was the oldest living World Championship driver from the death of Paul Pietsch in May 2012 until his own death in July 2015.

<text>Robin Michael Widdows (born 27 May 1942 in Cowley, Middlesex) is a British former racing driver from England. He participated in Formula One, Formula Two, Formula Three and sportscars including Le Mans.

Widdows began his career with an MG Midget and a Lotus 23 winning the &quot;Autosport&quot; Class C Championship in 1965. He moved to Formula Three the following year and in 1967 competed in Formula Two with a Brabham BT23, winning the Rhine Cup at Hockenheim. In 1968, Widdows joined The Chequered Flag team to compete in a McLaren M4A and that year took part in his only World Championship Grand Prix, for Cooper, in the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch but retired with ignition problems. He returned to Formula Two the following season with Bob Gerard and also raced sportscars for Matra. Widdows continued in Formula Two in 1970, with a Brabham, but retired from the sport part way through the season.

Widdows holds the rare distinction of being one of a select group of six who have competed in both a Formula One World Championship race and the Olympic Games (bobsleigh in 1964 and 1968).

On 17 January 1965, he became the fastest Englishman to ride the Cresta Run from Junction with a time of 44.14 secs, recorded in the Harjes Cartier Silver Chip handicap race.

<text>Goatsnake is an American stoner/doom metal band from Los Angeles. They have released three studio albums, the first being 1999&#x27;s &quot;Goatsnake Vol. 1&quot;.

==History==
Goatsnake was formed in 1996 after the disbanding of The Obsessed. After The Obsessed&#x27;s disbanding, the rhythm section consisting of bassist Guy Pinhas (also former of the Dutch Beaver) and drummer Greg Rogers began jamming with guitarist Greg Anderson (Thorr&#x27;s Hammer, Burning Witch, Sunn O)))). They soon found a vocalist in Pete Stahl (Scream, Wool, Earthlings?, The Desert Sessions).

Goatsnake recorded and released two 7-inch EPs in 1998 and were featured on several metal compilations. They released their debut full-length, &quot;1&quot;, in 1999 on Man&#x27;s Ruin Records/Rise Above Records.

Goatsnake toured Europe in support of their debut album and played with bands such as Unida, Fatso Jetson, and Electric Wizard. They returned in 2000 for a UK tour with Orange Goblin and Sunn O))), another Anderson project.

In 2000 Pinhas left Goatsnake to join Acid King and was replaced by Stuart Dahlquist of Burning Witch. Later that year Goatsnake released a split album with Burning Witch on Hydra Head Records. They also released the &quot;Dog Days&quot; EP on Anderson&#x27;s Southern Lord Records that same year. They went on to release their second album, &quot;Flower of Disease&quot; on Man&#x27;s Ruin Records/Rise Above Records.

The band split up in 2001 and Anderson continued with Sunn O))) and played in Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine.

In 2004 the band reformed with Anderson and Stahl being joined by bassist Scott Reeder (The Obsessed, Kyuss) and drummer JR Conners (Cave In). They recorded three songs which were released on the &quot;Trampled Under Hoof&quot; EP along with two previously vinyl-only tracks. This same year also saw the release of the compilation &quot;1 + Dog Days&quot; by Southern Lord Records, which combines the first album and the &quot;Dog Days&quot; EP as well as a track from the &quot;Man of Light&quot; EP.

Goatsnake reunited in 2010 with the original line up to headlining the Roadburn Festival on Thursday April 15. To coincide with the reunion a re-issue of &quot;Flower of Disease&quot; came out around the same time. On June 16, 2011, the band played another rare reunion show as special guests to Godflesh at The Forum in London, England.

Original members Anderson, Stahl, and Rogers, along with new bassist Scott Renner, and acclaimed record producer Nick Raskulinecz began working on a new full-length album, Black Age Blues, which was released in 2015. The current Goatsnake line up also played shows in October 2014 including the Southern Lord Records showcase in Los Angeles and the Southwest Terror Fest in Tucson, Arizona.

<text>Severo M. Ornstein (born 1930) is an American retired computer scientist and the son of composer Leo Ornstein. In 1955, he joined MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory as a programmer and designer for the SAGE air-defense system. He later joined the TX-2 group and became a member of the team that designed the LINC. He moved with the team to Washington University in St. Louis where he was one of the principal designers of macromodules.

Returning to Boston he joined Bolt, Beranek and Newman. When ARPA issued a Request for Proposal for the ARPANET, he joined the group that wrote the winning proposal. He was responsible for the design of the communication interfaces and other special hardware for the Interface Message Processor. In 1972 he headed the first delegation of U.S. computer scientists to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In 1976, he joined Xerox PARC where he implemented a computer interface to an early laser printer. Later he co-led (with Ed McCreight) the team that built the Dorado computer.
Ornstein co-designed Mockingbird, the first interactive computer-based music-score editor, and oversaw its programming.

In 1980 he was instrumental in starting Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR). He wrote an autobiography describing his experiences in computer science, published in 2002.

<text>Roger Williamson (2 February 1948 – 29 July 1973) was a British racing driver and a two time British Formula 3 champion, who died during his second Formula One race, the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort Circuit in the Netherlands.

==Biography==
Williamson was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. He won the 1971 and 1972 British Formula 3 Championship titles. In 1973, he was offered a drive in the March Engineering works Formula One team. Williamson originally tested for the BRM team, but his manager advised him to take the March offer, as March had a slightly stronger performance in the previous season.

==Death==


After his Formula One debut at the 1973 British Grand Prix, Williamson&#x27;s second Formula One appearance was at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort Circuit. On his eighth lap, a suspected tyre failure at the high speed esses near the Tunnel Oost (East Tunnel) caused his car to flip upside down and catch fire. Williamson had not been seriously injured by the impact, but was trapped under the car which was swiftly engulfed in flames. The track marshals were both poorly trained and badly equipped, and did not assist him. Another driver, David Purley, upon witnessing the crash of his friend, abandoned his own race and pulled over in a desperate and valiant attempt to rescue Williamson. He ran across the still active track to Williamson&#x27;s car and tried to turn it upright, before grabbing a fire extinguisher from a marshal and returning to the engulfed car. He emptied it on the car and signalled for others to help. Purley&#x27;s efforts to turn the car upright and extinguish the flames were in vain, and the marshals were unable to handle the vehicle without flame retardant overalls. Purley later stated he could hear Williamson&#x27;s screams from underneath the car, but by the time the first fire engine arrived and the fire was extinguished, Williamson had died of asphyxiation. As most racers mistakenly identified Purley as the driver of the crashed car, and therefore thought the burning car to be empty, none of them stopped to help and the race continued, even as Purley stood on the circuit and gestured with his hands for them to stop. Furthermore, the track marshals were wearing normal blazers and not the fire-resistant overalls which the drivers wore, and thus were not able to go near the large flames. Purley was later awarded the George Medal for the bravery he displayed in attempting to rescue Williamson. A series of photos of the incident, showing a clearly desperate and ultimately dejected Purley, won that year&#x27;s World Press Photo award for Photo Sequences. Williamson&#x27;s body was later cremated with his ashes being taken to an undisclosed location. In the years following the accident, fire-resistant clothing would become mandatory for all trackside marshals so that they would be able to assist in the event of a fire. The next few years also saw a noticeable increase in drivers stopping at accident sites to assist in rescue efforts, notably at the 1976 German Grand Prix. Williamson was 25 years old at the time of his death.

In 2003, on the thirtieth anniversary of his fatal crash, a bronze statue of Williamson was unveiled at the Donington Park circuit in his native Leicestershire. Then-owner Tom Wheatcroft had provided financial backing to Williamson, and described the day Williamson died as &quot;the saddest day of my life&quot;.

<text>Rudolf Krause (30 March 1907 – 11 April 1987) was a racing driver from East Germany.

==Biography==
Born in Reichenbach im Vogtland, Krause is mainly known as one of the leading sportsmen in motor racing in Formula Two, during his career between 1927 and 1954, beside other Formula Two drivers like Hans Stuck. In 1952 and 1953 he participated in two World Championship Grands Prix. He scored no championship points and his only finish was 14th in the 1953 German Grand Prix.
When Krause’s career began in 1927, he mainly raced in motorcycles. He switched to self-modified cars in the beginning of the 1930s. Soon after Krause’s career began, he set up his own mechanic shop inside of his garage in Reichenbach, and raced in his own BMW sports car. Krause’s formula racing career debuted in 1949 when racing in East Germany itself began races after the Second World War. Krause was a top contender when East Germany ran its own formula racing Grand Prix and championships between 1950 and 1953, placing in top positions several times and winning the formula 2 East German Championship in its last year of existence. He mainly drove in BMW race cars, many of which were at least partially built in his own workshop in Reichenbach. When Krause retired in 1954, it was mainly because of his age. However, it also awards him the distinction of one of the few East German drivers to not defect to western Germany to further his career.

<text>Samuel Felton Posey (born May 26, 1944) is an American former racing driver and sports broadcast journalist.

==Early life and driving career==
Posey&#x27;s father, Lt. (j.g.) Samuel Felton Posey, was killed in the Battle of Okinawa when a kamikaze struck his ship, the . His remains were never recovered. Posey grew up on his grandfather&#x27;s Connecticut estate near Lime Rock Park. Posey was bought a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL when he was 14 years old, and practiced driving the car around his family farm. He received his first racing lessons from neighbor John Fitch. Sam Posey started as an amateur sports car racer, and graduated to the Can-Am, in a car designed and funded by himself in collaboration with engineer friend Ray Caldwell. Posey raced the Sunoco Camaro for Roger Penske in 1968 in the Trans-Am Series. Chevrolet won the championship based on the Penske team effort. Mark Donohue was the lead driver and he won a remarkable 10 of 13 races. Posey&#x27;s first race was at Bridgehampton where he finished 3rd. Other finishes were: Meadowdale, 3rd; St Jovite, 3rd; Bryar, 6th; Watkins Glen, 2nd which was the only race that Donohue was beaten by a Camaro in 1968. Posey&#x27;s car was the same Sunoco Blue with yellow lettering as Donohue. Posey sported a yellow spoiler and Donohue had a red spoiler.

In 1969, he won the Lime Rock Trans-Am in a factory Ford Mustang. In 1970, Posey was the driver for Ray Caldwell&#x27;s factory-backed Autodynamics Dodge Challenger in Trans-Am, racing against Parnelli Jones, Dan Gurney, Mark Donohue and Jim Hall in what most racing historians regard as the greatest season of professional road racing in US history. Posey also raced in the USAC Championship Car series in the 1969 and 1972-1974 seasons, with 13 career starts, including the 1972 Indianapolis 500. Posey&#x27;s entry was disqualified from the 1973 Indianapolis 500 after USAC Technical Director Frank DelRoy discovered Posey&#x27;s team had disguised their already qualified car as another vehicle so that Posey could make another qualifying attempt to try to avoid being bumped from the field. He finished in the top ten 8 times, with his best finish in 3rd position in 1969 at the Kent road course. He was the team driver for Caldwell&#x27;s Can-Am racer which featured monocoque aluminum construction in two parallel longitudinal space frames, with solid front and rear axles.

As an endurance racer, Posey appeared at the 24 Hours of Le Mans 10 times (1966, 1969–1973, and 1975–1978) and finished in the top 10 five times. His best finish was 3rd position during the 1971 competition in which he drove the Ferrari 512M. He won the 1975 12 Hours of Sebring, teaming with three other drivers.

He participated in two Formula One world championship events, the 1971 and 1972 United States Grand Prix, retiring from the first and finishing 12th in the second, thus not scoring any championship points. He drove Surtees cars on both occasions, but only the first was a works-entered car.

He also competed in a single event in the NASCAR Grand National Series (now known as the NASCAR Cup Series), the first race of the 1970 season, held on the Riverside International Raceway road course in Riverside, California.

==Racing analyst==
===ABC===
Posey went on to become an auto racing commentator for ABC Sports. Posey debuted on ABC for the Indianapolis 500 in 1974, serving as analyst. In subsequent years, he served as a pit reporter but would fill in when regular analyst Jackie Stewart was unavailable as Posey was second choice as analyst. Posey returned to the booth starting in 1982 as Stewart reduced his workload. By 1986, Stewart had left and Posey was their first choice as analyst.

While commentating the 1986 Indianapolis 500, as there was a yellow flag out very near the end of the race, Posey used a two-way radio to ask an impromptu question to race leader Kevin Cogan. Posey was trying to ask Cogan about his thoughts in leading the Indianapolis 500 at this stage. Cogan tried to stave off the conversation once, but Posey persisted a second time, at which time Cogan politely replied to Posey that he was &quot;a little busy now,&quot; but would talk to him later. Posey understood the circumstances and told the audience if that were he, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to talk to me either.&quot; Moments later, on a restart with two laps remaining, Bobby Rahal jumped Cogan on the restart and went on to win.

Along with the Indy 500, Posey&#x27;s ABC Sports duties included commentary for the CART/PPG Indy Car World Series with Paul Page and Bobby Unser, lasting through 1995. Posey also appeared on selected NASCAR broadcasts on ABC. The three-man booth of Page, Posey, and Unser was a fixture of Indy car racing during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Posey and Bobby Unser were known to engage in friendly, but sometimes heated exchanges on-air. The friction reached a level such that beginning in 1993 at the Indy 500, Unser moved out of the booth and began reporting from a remote location in turn two.

In 1989, Posey was brought in as part of the ABC Sports broadcast team covering the 1989 Tour de France. Many people were surprised by Posey&#x27;s knowledge and genuine enthusiasm for the sport. ABC would bring him back as the lead anchor for the 1990 and 1991 races. Posey also worked as the play-by-play announcer for luge during ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.

===Speedvision===
Posey moved to Speedvision (later known as SPEED) in 1996, covering various races namely sports car racing and Formula One. He also did essay work for the coverage of the Tour de France on OLN/Versus (later known as NBCSN), serving as the &quot;Race Historian&quot;, and wrote for &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine.

==Recent years==
Posey is also the author of &quot;Playing With Trains,&quot; a book on model railroading published by Random House and his layout (the Colorado Midland) was featured in the February 1995 issue of &quot;Model Railroader&quot; Magazine, and &quot;The Mudge Pond Express&quot;, an autobiography which centers around his personal racing career and love of the sport.

An accomplished artist, painter and architect, in 1966 he earned his B.F.A. in painting from Rhode Island School of Design. Since 1995, Posey suffers from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which has attenuated his activities in recent years.

Posey was the voice for the pre-race build-up montage slotted between the Mercedes-Benz Pre-Race Show and the actual race coverage for each Formula 1 race shown on the Speed Channel. Posey also comments on recent Formula 1 races and the championship in a segment called &quot;Posey&#x27;s Perspective&quot; as part of the Formula 1 Debrief show (also featuring Bob Varsha, David Hobbs, Steve Matchett, and Will Buxton) on the Speed Channel. Posey narrated F1 montages for the NBC Sports Network from 2013 to 2017.

==Awards==

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2016.

==Tribute==

In 2013, the front straight at Lime Rock Park was renamed the Sam Posey Straight.

<text>Siegfried Stohr (born 10 October 1952) is a former racing driver from Italy. He participated in 13 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 15 March 1981. He scored no championship points.

==Biography==
Stohr started in the Italian Formula Italia class in 1976 finishing second in the championship. In 1977 he won the series. Stohr won the Italian Formula Three Championship in 1978 driving a Chevron and progressed to Formula two for 1979 where he took second places at Vallelunga and Pau, with a Chevron before switching with less success to a March. For 1980 he joined Alan Docking Racing, driving a Toleman, and finished fourth in the championship with one win, at Enna.

Stohr joined Arrows for the 1981 Formula One season, as teammate to Riccardo Patrese. Patrese proved considerably faster than Stohr, who struggled in his first few races. Just as Stohr began to improve, he was involved in a start-line accident at the 1981 Belgian Grand Prix; after Patrese&#x27;s engine stalled, his mechanic Dave Luckett ran onto the grid to try to reignite it while the race had already started. Stohr crashed into the back of Patrese&#x27;s car, seriously injuring Luckett. Stohr&#x27;s confidence was badly affected by the accident and his performance throughout the rest of the season deteriorated, along with that of his team, relative to their rivals. Stohr retired before the end of the season after crashing out of qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

After Formula One, Stohr made a short lived comeback in the Italian Superturismo Championship in 1989 driving a BMW M3.

A psychology graduate at the University of Padua, Stohr started a racing school and safe driving academy at the Misano circuit in 1982. In the 1990s he became a regular columnist for the Italian motorsport weekly &quot;Autosprint&quot;. He also wrote columns about driving safety in several publications.

<doc id="1235634" wikidata="Q5251803" url="?curid=1235634" title="Degory Priest">
<text>Degory Priest () was a member of the Leiden contingent on the historic 1620 voyage of the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot;. He was a hat maker from London who married Sarah, sister of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton in Leiden. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact in November 1620 and died less than two months later.

In some documents of the time, his name was also written as Digory Priest.

== English origins ==
According to Banks, the name Digory Priest or Prust is common in Devon and Cornwall. A family with those names was found residing in Lezant, co. Cornwall.

At the time of the Pilgrim emigration, families of this name were living in the London parishes of All Hallows the Great, All Hallows on the Wall, St. Augustine, St. Dunstan-in-the-West and St. Margaret Patten.

== Life in Holland ==
Per Banks, &quot;Digory&quot; Priest was credited as one of the &quot;Leyden&quot; contingent and was again identified as a hat-maker from London in Leyden records.

His name appears in many Leiden records of the time, being comparatively active in comparison to other church members. He became a citizen (burgess) of Leiden on November 16, 1615, with guarantors being future Mayflower compatriot Isaac Allerton and Roger Wilson.

Several Leiden incidents in June 1617 are recorded regarding Degory Priest’s involvement in activities that border on assault in one case and adultery in another. On June 28, 1617, Priest requested two tobacco pipe-makers to sign an affidavit that he had not hit John Cripps on June 17, 1617, but only &quot;touched his Jabot&quot; – i.e., the frill on the front of his shirt. The affidavit may have been needed by Priest to document his innocence in what could have been an assault case. And on the next day, June 18, 1617, Priest needed another affidavit, this time also involving John Cripps, card maker, who was rumored to have been in an adulterous relationship with Elizabeth, who was the wife of Leiden woolcomber John Mos.

On April 9, 1619, Degory Priest and Samuel Lee, both hatters, signed a good behavior document on behalf of Nicholas Claverly, a tobacco-pipe maker, who had arrived in Leiden about 1615 and resided in a house owned by Degory Priest. In the document, Priest stated an age of forty years, which indicated he was born about 1579.

Records show that on May 3, 1619, Degory Priest witnessed an affidavit to a statement signed by Richard Tyrill stating that Nicholas Claverly was not connected with the murder of Tyrill’s brother John Tyrill.
Degory Priest departed Plymouth, England, aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship‘s timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to illness that would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.

On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day. Degory Priest was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact on November 11, 1620.

From William Bradford’s later recollection of seven men from the &quot;Mayflower&quot; who died soon after arrival, &quot;Digerie Preist&quot; among them, with this comment: &quot;All these dyed sone after their arrival in the general sickness that befell.&quot; And with this about Priest’s family: &quot;But Digerie Preist had his wife and children sent hither afterwards, she being Mr. Allertons sister.&quot; Bradford closed his comments in this section with the note: &quot;But the rest left no posteritie here.&quot;

== Marriage and family ==
Degory Priest married Sarah (Allerton) Vincent on November 4, 1611. She was the widow of John Vincent and sister of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Isaac Allerton. They had two daughters, Mary and Sarah.

Sarah Priest married 2nd in Leiden on or shortly after November 13, 1621, Godbert Godbertson, whose name, per Banks, was also written as Cuthbert Cuthbertson. He was a hat-maker from Leiden, as was Priest, and had been in communion with the Pilgrims before their emigration. He had previously been married to Elizabeth Kendall in 1617, who presumably was deceased by the time of his second marriage. They came to Plymouth on the ship &quot;Anne&quot; in 1623 with their son and her two daughters. Both Sarah and her second husband Godbert Godbertson died in 1633 in the epidemic that was rampant at that time. Their burial places are unknown.

== Children of Degory Priest and his wife Sarah (Allerton) Priest ==
* Mary Priest was born about 1612 and died in Charlestown in 1689. She married Phineas Pratt by 1633 and had eight children. The family moved to Charlestown about 1646. Pratt was a person of note in Plymouth history, coming on the ship Sparrow in 1622, being one of Thomas Weston&#x27;s settlers at the failed Weymouth settlement, and coming to Plymouth in 1623.
* Sarah Priest was born about 1614, went to England by October 1646, and may have died there, date and place unknown. She married John Coombs about 1632 and had two sons. For reasons that are not known, possibly the demise of her husband, Sarah traveled to England about 1645 and left her two sons, John and Francis Coombs, in the care of William Spooner, who had agreed to their maintenance. It is believed that Sarah never returned to Massachusetts Colony, either having died on the voyage, or in England.

== Death and burial ==
Priest died early in the first winter, on January 1, 1621, of the &quot;general sickness&quot;. He was aged about 42 years.

He was buried likely sometime in January 1621 in Cole&#x27;s Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, most probably in an unmarked grave, as was the custom that first winter. Along with many others who died in the winter of 1620–1621, his name is memorialized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, located on Cole&#x27;s Hill in Plymouth.

== Sarah Allerton, wife of Degory Priest and Godbert Godbertson ==
After Priest’s death, his wife Sarah married another hat-maker, Godbert Godbertson (or Cuthbert Cuthbertson), on November 13, 1621, with whom she had one son, Samuel, born possibly about 1622. Godbertson was said by Edward Winslow to be an English speaker of the Dutch Church and a member of the Separatist church in Leiden. They came, with their son Samuel Cuthbertson (later shortened to Cuthbert) and her daughters Mary and Sarah Priest, to Plymouth on the ship &quot;Anne&quot; in 1623. They were assigned land in the 1623 Division of Land with 6 &quot;akers&quot; for &quot;Cudbart Cudbartsone&quot; – one acre for the deceased Priest and one each for his wife Sarah, her second husband Godbert Godbertson and their three children. Both Godbertson and his wife Sarah died in the Massachusetts smallpox epidemic of 1633 sometime that fall, with their estate inventories being taken on October 24, 1633. Their burial places are unknown.

Sarah Allerton was the sister of a Mayflower passenger, Isaac Allerton.

<text>John &quot;Skip&quot; Barber III (born November 16, 1936) is an American retired racecar driver who is most famous for previously owning and founding the Skip Barber Racing Schools.

==Driving career==
Barber started racing in 1958 while studying at Harvard University, where he earned a degree in English.

In the mid-1960s, he won three SCCA national championships in a row and finished third in the 1967 United States Road Racing Championship. Later, Barber won consecutive Formula Ford National Championships (1969 and 1970), a record tied only recently.

At the start of the 1971 season he purchased a March 711, which he planned to take back to the United States and race in the U.S. Formula 5000 series. Before he did so, he took part in the Monaco Grand Prix, Dutch Grand Prix, United States Grand Prix, and Canadian Grand Prix in a privately funded March. He returned to the U.S. and Canadian races in 1972. After that, he raced GT cars.

==Retirement leads to Skip Barber Racing==
When his racing career ended, Barber&#x27;s belief that auto racing was &quot;coachable&quot; in the same manner as any other sport—at the time, a distinctly minority position—led him to create the eponymously named racing school, and a year later the equal-car race series.

In 1975, with two borrowed Lola Formula Fords and four students, Barber started the Skip Barber School of High Performance Driving. In 1976 it was renamed the &quot;Skip Barber Racing School&quot;, and that same year he created the Skip Barber Race Series. Barber divested from the racing school in 1999.

Barber was the owner and operator of Lime Rock Park, a road-racing venue in Connecticut. In April 2021 he sold the facility to Lime Rock Group, LLC. 
He maintains a minority stake. He lives in the nearby town of Sharon, CT with wife Judy.

Barber was inducted into the SCCA Hall of Fame on March 2, 2013.

<text>Stéphane Jean-Marc Sarrazin (born 2 November 1975) is a French racing and rally driver. He has won races across a number of single-seater, sportscar and rallying disciplines and competitions, was French Formula Renault champion in 1994, and Le Mans Series champion in both 2007 and 2010. Although he has never won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, he has finished on the podium six times, including four outright second positions. He participated in one Formula One Grand Prix, the 1999 Brazilian Grand Prix, for Minardi as a replacement for Luca Badoer, who had injured his wrist. He suffered a big spin in the race coming up to the start-finish straight on lap 31 and scored no championship points. He also carried out testing duties for the Prost Grand Prix team during the 1999–2001 Formula One seasons and for Toyota Racing in their first season in .

==Career==
During the 1999 season, Sarrazin raced in International Formula 3000, winning one race at the Hungaroring. In 2003, he raced in the Superfund World Series.

In 2004, Sarrazin converted to rallying and competed in two World Rally Championship events, posting a best result of 4th. He was signed to drive Subaru&#x27;s second car along with young Australian Chris Atkinson as a teammate to defending world champion Petter Solberg. He also competed at the 2004 Race of Champions.
Sarrazin drove an Aston Martin DBR9 in the GT1 class of the 2006 American Le Mans Series, but was announced on January 10, 2007 as an official works driver for Peugeot Sport in the Le Mans Series, driving the new 908 HDi FAP diesel Le Mans Prototype. He won the 2007 Le Mans Series with Pedro Lamy, by winning three races. Sarrazin also took pole position at the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished second in the race with Lamy and Sébastien Bourdais. He won the 2008 24 Hours of Spa driving the Vitaphone Racing Team Maserati MC12. He finished third in the 2009 Monte Carlo rally. Sarrazin finished second again in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans. He finished fourth overall on the Monte Carlo round of the 2010 Intercontinental Rally Challenge.

Following Peugeot&#x27;s withdrawal from endurance racing, Sarrazin signed with Starworks Motorsport for the 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship. Sarrazin also signed a temporary deal to drive the Toyota TS030 Hybrid at Le Mans due to the withdrawal of Hiroaki Ishiura on medical grounds.

In 2013, Sarrazin joined Toyota Racing full-time as a driver of the Toyota TS030. Sarrazin helped the team finish 2nd at Le Mans and scored his first win with the team in Bahrain.

Sarrazin continued with Toyota Racing in 2014, and signed for Venturi Grand Prix to race in Formula E. He finished the first ever race of the series, the 2014 Beijing ePrix in 9th place. Two months later in November 2014 he took his first international rally victory in the Tour de Corse, which was the last rally of the 2014 European Rally Championship.

In 2021, Sarrazin entered the inaugural season of the Extreme E all-electric off-road racing series for Veloce Racing. During the 2021 Island X-Prix, he suffered a massive rollover, but he came out unscathed, though he went to the medical centre for precautionary checks.

<text>No. 610 (County of Chester) Squadron of the Royal Air Force was a Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force. Comprising very high quality pilots, often ex-RAF officers and occasionally locally based company Test pilots from companies such as de Havilland and Airwork, its pilots were initially part timers who would spend their weekends and spare time flying and practising combat manoeuvres. The squadron was named the &quot;County of Chester&quot; and adopted the motto &quot;Alifero tollitur axe ceres&quot;; which translates as &quot;Ceres rising in a winged chariot&quot;, Ceres being the Roman Goddess of Wheat, a reference to Chester&#x27;s Agricultural sector. Its badge contained the image of a garb (sheaf of wheat).

610 Squadron Association, with headquarters at Hooton Park, has a substantial number of ex-members of the Squadron on its list of members.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
The squadron was formed on 10 February 1936 at Hooton Park, Wirral, Cheshire as one of the Auxiliary Air Force Squadrons. It was equipped with Hawker Hart light bombers. As war approached, these were replaced by Hawker Hinds in May 1938. On 1 January 1939 the squadron role was changed to that of a fighter squadron, and on the outbreak of war in September 1939 it received its first Hawker Hurricane fighters. By the end of that same month it was flying the more advanced Supermarine Spitfire fighter.

=== Second World War ===

610 Squadron gained its first experience of aerial combat against the Luftwaffe whilst desperately attempting to protect the Army and Navy during the Dunkirk evacuation.

It was a very tough few days for ‘The Chesters’, operating in difficult conditions from RAF Gravesend, against an enemy air force which was a battle-hardened foe. In just four engagements with the enemy, 610 Squadron lost seven pilots Missing or Killed In Action,  and one wounded; 610 made claims of ten enemy aircraft destroyed, three unconfirmed destroyed and one damaged, which shows the lethal nature of the dogfights. All of 610’s casualties were experienced pilots, but they inevitably lacked any &quot;combat&quot; experience, which could only be gained during the life or death struggles in the skies over Dunkirk.

During the first two months of the Battle of Britain, 610 Squadron operated out of RAF Biggin Hill as part of 11 Group, where it was one of the units bearing the brunt of German attacks. It moved to RAF Acklington for rest and recuperation at the end of August 1940, having fought heroically but sustained heavy casualties in the process. During the Battle of Britain, 610 Squadron&#x27;s pilots included Squadron Leader Andrew Thomas Smith AFC, Squadron Leader John Ellis DFC, Flight Lieutenant Edward Brian Bretherton Smith DFC, Flight Lieutenant William Warner, Flying Officer Stanley Norris DFC, Flying Officer Constantine Oliver Joseph Pegge DRC, Sergeant Ronald Hamlyn DFM and Sergeant Horatio Herbert Chandler DFM.

In 1941, 610 Squadron moved south to RAF Westhampnett where it was one of Douglas Bader&#x27;s three Spitfire squadrons of the Tangmere wing. It remained based in the UK until late 1944 when it moved to the Continent to provide fighter cover as the allies entered Germany. 610 Squadron was disbanded before the end of the war at RAF Warmwell on 3 March 1945.

===Post-war===

The squadron was re-formed on 10 May 1946 at RAF Hooton Park as a Royal Auxiliary Air Force fighter squadron, embodied in June of that year and receiving its first Spitfire F.14s in November 1946, switching to more powerful Spitfire F.22s in March 1949. Gloster Meteor F.4 jet fighters were received in July 1951, being replaced by the later F.8 version in March 1952. Meteor T.7 twin-seat training aircraft were also used as advanced conversion trainers. The Meteors were flown until shortly before the squadron disbanded on 10 March 1957, together with all other RAuxAF flying units.

<text>Tarso Anibal Santanna Marques (born 19 January 1976) is a Brazilian racing driver. He previously participated in 24 Formula One Grands Prix, all driving for the Minardi team, but scored no championship points in three separate seasons and never completed a full year in the sport.

==Racing career==
===Open wheel racing===
After five years of karting, Marques raced in Formula Chevrolet in his home country aged only 16, and he won the title at his first attempt. In 1993 he moved up to Formula Three Sudamericana and subsequently European Formula 3000, and became the youngest driver to win races at both levels. In , he started racing for Minardi in Formula One, competing with various drivers for the seat over the following two years, including Giancarlo Fisichella, Jarno Trulli and Pedro Lamy. Minardi&#x27;s financial situation demanded that drivers with strong sponsorship were generally favoured, and there were several driver changes in the team at that time.

In 1999, he moved stateside to drive in the American Champ Car ranks, and caught the eye of legendary team-owner Roger Penske. When two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Al Unser Jr. was injured, Penske asked him to fill in. His best finish was 9th. In 2000, 2004, and 2005, he drove sporadically in that series for perennial minnows Dale Coyne Racing, with a best result of 11th.

Marques returned to Formula One in to race alongside future double World Champion Fernando Alonso in the Minardi team, newly purchased by Paul Stoddart. He finished the season ahead of the Spaniard but it was a difficult season for Marques, with the team&#x27;s financial difficulties not always allowing equal equipment for both drivers. Marques brought no money to the team and was employed under the provision that another driver with more sponsorship money could replace him at any point in the season, and that prospect was realised towards the end of the year, when Minardi replaced Marques with Alex Yoong with three races remaining. Marques welcomed the driver change as the extra finance would enable the team to progress, adding, &quot;Yoong brought the sponsor for the team already two or three races ago so he should be in the car.&quot; His two ninth-place finishes remained Minardi&#x27;s best results of the season, but he was nearly always outpaced by Alonso. Marques would however remain at Minardi for 2002 as the test and reserve driver. Despite this, he did not replace Yoong later in the season when the Malaysian was dropped, with the seat instead going to Anthony Davidson, and Justin Wilson also being offered the drive ahead of Marques.

Since his last Champ Car outing in 2005, Marques has returned to South America to drive in the TC2000 and Stock Car Brasil touring car championships.

===Stock car racing===
In March 2022, it was announced that Marques would compete in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 79 Ford Mustang for Team Stange Racing on a part-time basis. His Cup Series debut, which was going to be in the race at Road America, had to be delayed as NASCAR would not approve him to make a Cup Series start without any prior experience in a stock car. As a result, TSR announced that they would field an entry for Marques in the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at the Indianapolis Road Course in order for him to be approved to race in the Cup Series, and his first Cup Series start would now be in the race at Watkins Glen. The team and Marques did not show up for the race weekend. Nothing has been heard from the team since then, and they ended up not running at all in 2022.

<text>Rabban Bar Ṣawma (Syriac language: , ; 1220January 1294), also known as Rabban Ṣawma or Rabban Çauma (), was a Uyghur or Ongud monk turned diplomat of the &quot;Nestorian&quot; Church of the East in China. He is known for embarking on a pilgrimage from Yuan China to Jerusalem with one of his students, Markos (later Patriarch Yahballaha III). Due to military unrest along the way, they never reached their destination, but instead spent many years in Ilkhanate-controlled Baghdad.

The younger Markos was eventually elected Yahballaha III, Patriarch of the Church of the East and later suggested his teacher Rabban Bar Ṣawma be sent on another mission, as Mongol ambassador to Europe. The elderly monk met with many of the European monarchs, as well as the Pope, in attempts to arrange a Franco-Mongol alliance. The mission bore no fruit, but in his later years in Baghdad, Rabban Bar Ṣawma documented his lifetime of travel. His written account of his journeys is of unique interest to modern historians, as it gives a picture of medieval Europe at the close of the Crusades, painted by a keenly-intelligent, broadminded, and statesmanlike observer.

Bar Ṣawma&#x27;s travels occurred before the return of Marco Polo to Europe, and his writings give a reverse viewpoint, of the East looking to the West.

==Early life==

Rabban (&quot;monk&quot; in Syriac) Bar Ṣawma was born c. 1220 in or near modern-day Beijing, known then as Zhongdu, later as Khanbaliq under Mongol rule. According to Bar Hebraeus he was of Uyghur origin. Chinese accounts describe his heritage as Öngüd, a Turkic people classified as members of the &quot;Mongol&quot; caste under Yuan law. The name &quot;bar Ṣawma&quot; is Aramaic for &quot;Son of Fasting&quot; though he was born to a wealthy family. He was a &quot;Church of the East Christian&quot;, and became an ascetic monk around the age of 20 and then a religious teacher for decades.

==Pilgrimage to Jerusalem==
In his middle age, Rabban Bar Sauma and one of his younger students, Rabban Markos, embarked on a journey from Yuan China to make pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They traveled by way of the former Tangut country, Khotan, Kashgar, Taraz in the Syr Darya valley, Khorasan (now Afghanistan), Maragha (now Azerbaijan) and Mosul, arriving at Ani in the Kingdom of Georgia. Warnings of danger on the routes to southern Syria turned them from their purpose, and they traveled to Mongol-controlled Persia, the Ilkhanate, where they were welcomed by Patriarch Denha I of the Church of the East. The Patriarch requested the two monks to visit the court of the Mongol Ilkhanate ruler Abaqa Khan, to obtain confirmation letters for Mar Denha&#x27;s ordination as Patriarch in 1266. During the journey, Rabban Markos was declared a &quot;Nestorian&quot; bishop. The Patriarch then attempted to send the monks as messengers back to China, but military conflict along the route delayed their departure, and they remained in Baghdad. When the Patriarch died, Rabban Markos was elected as his replacement, Yahballaha III, in 1281. The two monks traveled to Maragheh to have the selection confirmed by Abaqa, but the Ilkhanate khan died before their arrival, and was succeeded by his son, Arghun.

It was Arghun&#x27;s desire to form a strategic Franco-Mongol alliance with the Christian Europeans against their common enemy, the Muslim Mamluk Sultanate at Cairo. A few years later, the new patriarch Yahballaha III suggested his former teacher Rabban Bar Ṣawma for the embassy, to meet with the Pope and the European monarchs.

==Ambassador to Europe==

In 1287, the elderly Bar Sauma embarked on his journey to Europe, bearing gifts and letters from Arghun to the Eastern Roman emperor, the Pope, and the European kings. He followed the embassy of another &quot;Nestorian&quot;, Isa Kelemechi, sent by Arghun to Pope Honorius IV, in 1285.

Rabban Bar Sauma traveled with a large retinue of assistants, and 30 riding animals. Companions included the Church of the East Christian (&quot;archaon&quot;) Sabadinus; Thomas de Anfusis (or Tommaso d&#x27;Anfossi), who helped as interpreter and was also a member of a famous Genoese banking company; and an Italian interpreter named Uguetus or Ugeto (Ughetto). Bar Sauma likely did not speak any European languages, though he was known to be fluent in Chinese, Turkic, and Persian, and he was able to read Syriac. Europeans communicated to him in Persian.

He traveled overland through Armenia to either the Empire of Trebizond or through the Sultanate of Rum to the Simisso on the Black Sea, then by boat to Constantinople, where he had an audience with Andronicus II Palaeologus. Bar Sauma&#x27;s writings give a particularly enthusiastic description of the beautiful Hagia Sophia. He next traveled to Italy, again journeying by ship. As their course took them past the island of Sicily, he witnessed and recorded the great eruption of Mount Etna on 18 June 1287. A few days after his arrival, he also witnessed a naval battle in the Bay of Sorrento on St. John&#x27;s Day, 24 June 1287, during the conflict of the Sicilian Vespers. The battle was between the fleet of Charles II (whom he calls &quot;Irid Shardalo&quot;, i.e. &quot;Il re Charles Due&quot;), who had welcomed him in his realm, and James II of Aragon, king of Sicily (whom he calls &quot;Irid Arkon&quot;, i.e. &quot;Il re de Aragon&quot;). According to Bar Sauma, James II was victorious, and his forces killed 12,000 men.

He next traveled to Rome, but too late to meet Pope Honorius IV, who had recently died. So Bar Sauma instead engaged in negotiations with the cardinals, and visited St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Bar Sauma next made stops in Tuscany (&quot;Thuzkan&quot;) and the Republic of Genoa, on his way to Paris. He spent the winter of 1287–1288 in Genoa, a famous banking capital. In France (&quot;Frangestan&quot;), he spent one month with King Philip the Fair, who seemingly responded positively to the arrival of the Mongol embassy, gave him numerous presents, and sent one of his noblemen, Gobert de Helleville, to accompany Bar Sauma back to Mongol lands. Gobert de Helleville departed on 2 February 1288, with &quot;clercs&quot; Robert de Senlis and Guillaume de Bruyères, as well as &quot;l&#x27;arbalétrier&quot; (crossbowman) Audin de Bourges. They joined Bar Sauma when he later returned through Rome, and accompanied him back to Persia.

In Gascony in southern France, which at that time was in English hands, Bar Sauma met King Edward I of England, probably in the capital of Bordeaux. Edward responded enthusiastically to the embassy, but ultimately proved unable to join a military alliance due to conflict at home, especially with the Welsh and the Scots.

Upon returning to Rome, Bar Sauma was cordially received by the newly elected Pope Nicholas IV, who gave him communion on Palm Sunday, 1288, allowing him to celebrate his own Eucharist in the capital of Latin Christianity. Nicholas commissioned Bar Sauma to visit the Christians of the East, and entrusted to him a precious tiara to be presented to Mar Yahballaha (Rabban Bar Sauma&#x27;s former student, Markos). Bar Sauma then returned to Baghdad in 1288, carrying messages and many other gifts from the various European leaders.

The delivered letters were in turn answered by Arghun in 1289, forwarded by the Genoese merchant Buscarello de Ghizolfi, a diplomatic agent for the Il-khans. In the letter to Philip IV, Arghun mentions Bar Sauma:


The exchanges towards the formation of an alliance with the Europeans ultimately proved fruitless, and Arghun&#x27;s attempts were eventually abandoned. However, Rabban Bar Sauma did succeed in making some important contacts which encouraged communication and trade between the East and West. Aside from King Philip&#x27;s embassy to the Mongols, the Papacy also sent missionaries such as Giovanni da Montecorvino to the Mongol court.

==Later years==
After his embassy to Europe, Bar Sauma lived out the rest of his years in Baghdad. It was probably during this time that he wrote the account of his travels, which was published in French in 1895 and in English in 1928 as &quot;The Monks of Kublai Khan, Emperor of China&quot; or &quot;The History of the Life and Travels of Rabban Sawma, Envoy and Plenipotentiary of the Mongol Khans to the Kings of Europe, and Markos Who as Mar Yahbh-Allaha III Became Patriarch of the Church of the East in Asia&quot;, translated and edited by Sir E. A. Wallis Budge. The narrative is unique for its observations of medieval Europe during the end of the Crusading period, through the eyes of an observant outsider from a culture thousands of miles away.

Rabban Bar Sauma died in 1294, in Baghdad.

<text>The Belfast Giants (known officially as the [[Stena Line]] Belfast Giants due to sponsorship) are a professional ice hockey team based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. They compete in the UK&#x27;s Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL). They play their home games at the SSE Arena (formerly known as the Odyssey Arena) and are owned by the Odyssey Trust, a charitable company set up to hold and maintain the Odyssey complex, including the SSE Arena and its facilities. The Giants operated as the anchor tenant for the Arena at its opening before becoming an integrated part of the organisation.

Since their inception in 2000, the Giants have won sixteen major honours, including seven British league championships (by finishing top of the regular season standings), three British national championships (by winning the post-season play-off tournament), and five Challenge Cups.

==History==
=== Background and creation of franchise ===
The Belfast Giants Ltd. was founded in 1997 by two Canadian businessmen, Bob Zeller and his associate Albert Maasland, after Zeller was in talks with the British Ice Hockey Superleague (BISL) to launch a new franchise in the United Kingdom. The city of Belfast was chosen, with its new £92 million Millennium Commission project, the Odyssey Complex, due to be completed with the addition of a deal brokered between the Odyssey Trust and facility management company SMG to house the new hockey team in the arena. On 22 March 2000, the BISL confirmed that the Belfast Giants had been accepted into the league to begin play in September for the 2000-01 season.

In order to build a competitive roster for the new club, Bob Zeller approached Bracknell Bees championship-winning head coach Dave Whistle to become the first head coach of the Belfast Giants. Initially, Whistle was sceptical, deterred by having seen the violent footage of The Troubles on North American news media. In response, Zeller invited Whistle to visit Belfast and experience the changing city first-hand. Following his visit, Whistle agreed on a 3-year deal to coach the Giants. Whistle&#x27;s roster recruitment began by looking toward his championship team in Bracknell, signing seven core players from that team to build upon in Belfast: Shane Johnson, Todd Kelman, Rob Stewart, Todd Goodwin, Kevin Riehl, Paxton Schulte, and Colin Ward. The captaincy was awarded to incumbent signing Jeff Hoad, with assistants Jason Bowen and Colin Ward.

=== Superleague era (2000-03) ===

==== Inaugural season ====
The beginning of the inaugural Giants season was marred with difficulties as the opening of the Odyssey Arena was delayed until early December 2000. This meant that the Giants were forced to play their first 15 games of the season on the road, without consistent ice-time for training or practice. Regardless, the Giants made their debut on 16 September 2000 against the Nottingham Panthers losing 5–1, with Kory Karlander scoring the club&#x27;s first ever goal. The next evening, the Giants would travel to Bracknell in an unwelcome return for Whistle and his former Bees core. The Giants came out on top 6-5 after a shoot-out for their first ever win. However, the Giants would win only 4 out of 15 games to start the year.

Finally, the Giants played their first home game against the Ayr Scottish Eagles on 2 December 2000 to a sell-out crowd of 7,300 in what Whistle described as an &quot;awesome spectacle&quot; despite a 2–1 defeat. In the first period, Paxton Schulte would score the only goal for the Giants and fought Trevor Doyle shortly after, cementing his overnight status as a cult player for the hometown fans. The home ice proved to instigate a turn in fortune for the Giants mid-way through the season, playing in front of a consistently sold-out Odyssey Arena. The Giants would finish the season with a respectable 17-16-6-9 record, finishing in 6th place, and progressing into Group A of the playoffs to then be knocked out with a 3–3 record. The Giants saw more success in the Challenge Cup, finishing 1st in the group stage to progress to the two-leg semi-final against the Sheffield Steelers. The Giants won the first leg, 2–1, and lost the second leg, 7–0, for an 8-2 aggregate loss.

==== First Championship ====
Dave Whistle re-signed ten members of the original line-up for the Giants second season, adding only six to the new roster; defencemen Chad Allan and Terran Sandwith, forwards Curt Bowen, Dave Matsos and Jason Ruff, and Mike Bales in goal. Jeff Hoad, Jason Bowen, and Colin Ward would retain their roles as captain and assistant captains respectively, to be joined by Sandwith as a third assistant captain. The season began with an exhibition tournament, the BT Ice Cup, hosted by the Giants with invitations to the London Knights, Eisbären Berlin, and the Frankfurt Lions.

In their first league game, the Giants suffered a 9–3 defeat to the London Knights. This would be followed by a succession of sub-par performance on the road. By late September, Whistle decided to bring in centre Sean Berens to bolster the Giants offence. Berens&#x27; arrival and subsequent placement on the first line with Riehl and Ruff would prove a catalyst for the Giants&#x27; success to come. The Giants would go on a 9-game unbeaten streak shortly thereafter, which was broken by two losses, the first away in London and the second at home to the Nottingham Panthers on 16 October, which would be their last home defeat of the season. The Giants would then win 7–2 at home against Ayr to gain 1st place, where the team would remain for the rest of the season.

Following a 4–1 win at Sheffield on 17 January 2001, the Giants travelled to Bracknell needing only 1 point to win the league. On the 19th January, in a poetic return to Bracknell for Whistle and his former Bees core, the Giants would force a 2–2 draw with the home side to clinch their first ever championship with a league record-breaking 16-game unbeaten streak. Upon their arrival back in Belfast, the Giants were welcomed at Belfast City Airport by over one thousand boisterous fans. Unfortunately the Giants would struggle with a championship hangover as the team botched come playoff time, not making it past the qualification group. The Giants would, however, advance to the Challenge Cup final for the first time in their history, only to be stifled 5-0 by the Scottish Eagles. That particular match became known amongst fans of the Belfast Giants at that time as &#x27;Black Sunday&#x27; A reference to the jersey worn by the team during the match, introduced for the occasion of their inaugural Challenge cup as well as the day it was played on and the heavy defeat by a team that had suffered crushing losses to them during the regular season. Hockey fans who watched that game and also watched the Winter Olympics Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey final later on/in the early hours of the next day would have seen Theo Fleury, a later Giants signing receive his gold medal as part of the winning team.

==== Playoff title and Superleague&#x27;s demise ====
With the eventual demise of the Superleague in mid-2003, there were concerns that the Giants organisation would not survive because of developing financial issues. The club ran up debts of approximately £1.4 million, with Maasland saying that the Giants were &quot;by far and away the worst business [he had] been involved in&quot;. One partner company was believed to be owed nearly £65,000. However, facing the threat of liquidation, creditors voted to accept a 20p-to-the-pound pay-out, allowing the club to continue under new ownership of local businessman Jim Gillespie and join the newly established first-tier of British ice hockey dubbed the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL).

=== Elite League era (2003-present) ===

The Belfast Giants have won six EIHL regular season titles - the most recent of which came during the 2022-23 campaign, five Challenge Cup titles (including in 2017–18, 2018–19, 2021–22 and 2022–23), and two play-off championships.

Belfast Giants were added to EA Sports&#x27; NHL 20 game, enabling players to take control of the Giants in the Champions Hockey League.

The 2019–20 EIHL season was cancelled on 13 March 2020 with the remaining league fixtures and subsequent play-offs scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Challenge Cup was the only competition to see a winner crowned.

The 2020–21 Elite League season - originally pencilled in for a revised start date of 5 December - was suspended on 15 September 2020, because of ongoing uncertainty over coronavirus pandemic restrictions. The EIHL board determined that the season was non-viable without supporters being permitted to attend matches and unanimously agreed to a suspension. The season was cancelled completely in February 2021.

In March 2022, the Belfast Giants won their fourth Challenge Cup title after beating the Cardiff Devils 3–2 in overtime at the SSE Arena. The victory made head coach Adam Keefe the most successful in Giants history. The Giants then clinched the 2021–22 Elite League title in April, after a 2-1 shootout victory over the Sheffield Steelers. However they missed out on the treble after losing the 2022 EIHL play-off final 6-3 to the Cardiff Devils.

===Treble winners===

The Belfast Giants won their fifth Challenge Cup in March 2023 following a 9-3 victory against the Fife Flyers in a sold out SSE Arena. The following month they clinched the 2022–23 Elite League title with a 6-1 victory against the Guildford Flames, thus making them the most successful team in the Elite League era as of 2023. They then completed the Elite League grand slam with a 4-1 victory over Cardiff in the play-off final - becoming the first team to win all three domestic trophies in the same season since Nottingham in 2013.

==Team information==

=== Logos and uniforms ===
Since 2000 the Giants&#x27; main logo has depicted a stylized version of the mythical warrior Finn McCool, who is commonly portrayed as a giant in popular folklore and has a close association with Ulster. The original logo had Finn brandishing a hockey stick with the Giants&#x27; wordmark in the foreground. The inaugural Giants uniforms featured white home jerseys with red and teal striping, matching socks, and black shorts. The inaugural away jerseys featured their now famous teal with red and white striping, matching socks, and black shorts.

For the 2001–02 season the Giants introduced red jerseys with teal and white striping for the BT Ice Cup, and black jerseys with teal and red striping for the Challenge Cup.

In 2002–03, the Giants altered their home jerseys to feature red shoulder piping with teal and black stripes.

For 2004–05 the Giants replaced the red shoulder piping with black piping on home jerseys and changed away jerseys to mirror these except with teal as the primary colour.

Ahead of the 2021–22 EIHL season, the Giants unveiled a refreshed primary logo and alteration to the club&#x27;s home, away and Challenge Cup jerseys.

=== Arena ===
One corner of the SSE Arena has been dubbed &#x27;Boomerang Corner&#x27; – named in memory of long time Giants fan, Stewart Boone – and was left unreserved for a large group of fans who generate noise, bang drums, and start game night chants until the 2022–23 season when these seats became bookable.

Originally there was a traditional four-sided scoreboard suspended over centre ice. This has recently been replaced by two large screens for scores and video replays; one behind Boomerang Corner and one at the opposite corner of the rink. Two traditional scoreboards are located in the two remaining corners.

===Team culture===
Sectarianism has long been a significant problem with sports in Northern Ireland. When the club was established, Giants&#x27; management was committed to ensure the club did not attach itself to any particular faith or community, instead aspiring to represent Belfast as a whole. A number of policies were introduced to achieve this. Football colours, clothing, and flags which may have displayed a person&#x27;s political or religious affiliation were banned from the arena. The national anthem of the United Kingdom, traditionally played before games at other arenas in the Elite League, is not played before Giants games. The colours of the team, notably the dominant &#x27;teal&#x27; used in both its logo and uniform, was chosen specifically because it had no national or political connotations in Northern Ireland.

These policies have been successful as the Giants have built a large and enthusiastic fanbase which has become known as the &#x27;Teal Army&#x27;. As of 16 March 2020, the Giants had averaged an attendance of 4,387, ranking them 3rd amongst UK teams and 80th in Europe.

The Giants have an official podcast, &quot;A View From the Bridge&quot;, hosted by fans Patrick Smyth, Davy McGimpsey, Simon Kitchen, and Gareth Martin. There is also an official supporters club known as the Giants OSC.

=== Team songs ===
For many years, the Giants have been introduced onto the ice with the song &quot;Rise&quot; by English rock band The Cult. In recent years, &quot;A Warrior&#x27;s Call&quot; by Danish band Volbeat has also been used as the team&#x27;s entrance theme. Their goal song begins with The Irish Rovers&#x27; version of &quot;The Belle of Belfast City&quot;, a popular local rendition of the old children&#x27;s folk song &quot;I&#x27;ll Tell Me Ma&quot;. This is mixed into &quot;Song 2&quot; by English Britpop group Blur before face-off.

<text>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (), sometimes titled Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, is a 1905 work by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in which the author advances his theory of sexuality, in particular its relation to childhood.

== Synopsis ==
Freud&#x27;s book covered three main areas: sexual perversions; childhood sexuality; and puberty.

===The Sexual Aberrations===

Freud began his first essay, on &quot;The Sexual Aberrations&quot;, by distinguishing between the &quot;sexual object&quot; and the &quot;sexual aim&quot;—noting that deviations from the norm could occur with respect to both. The &quot;sexual object&quot; is therein defined as a desired object, and the &quot;sexual aim&quot; as what acts are desired with said object.

Discussing the choice of children and animals as sex objects—pedophilia and bestiality—he notes that most people would prefer to limit these perversions to the insane &quot;on aesthetic grounds&quot; but that they exist in normal people also. He also explores deviations of sexual aims, as in the tendency to linger over preparatory sexual aspects such as looking and touching.

Turning to neurotics, Freud emphasised that &quot;in them tendencies to every kind of perversion can be shown to exist as unconscious forces...neurosis is, as it were, the negative of perversion&quot;. Freud also makes the point that people who are behaviorally abnormal are always sexually abnormal in his experience but that many people who are normal behaviorally otherwise are sexually abnormal also.

Freud concluded that &quot;a disposition to perversions is an original and universal disposition of the human sexual instinct and that...this postulated constitution, containing the germs of all the perversions, will only be demonstrable in &quot;children&quot;“.

===Infantile Sexuality===

His second essay, on &quot;Infantile Sexuality&quot;, argues that children have sexual urges, from which adult sexuality only gradually emerges via psychosexual development.

Looking at children, Freud identified many forms of infantile sexual emotions, including thumb sucking, autoeroticism, and sibling rivalry.

===The Transformations of Puberty===

In his third essay, &quot;The Transformations of Puberty&quot;, Freud formalised the distinction between the &#x27;fore-pleasures&#x27; of infantile sexuality and the &#x27;end-pleasure&#x27; of sexual intercourse.

He also demonstrated how the adolescent years consolidate sexual identity under the dominance of the genitals.

===Summary===

Freud sought to link to his theory of the unconscious put forward in &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899) and his work on hysteria by positing sexuality as the driving force of both neuroses (through repression) and perversion.

In its final version, the &quot;Three Essays&quot; also included the concepts of penis envy, castration anxiety, and the Oedipus complex.

== Textual history ==
===In German language===
The &quot;Three Essays&quot; underwent a series of rewritings and additions over a twenty-year succession of editions—changes which expanded its size by one half, from 80 to 120 pages. The sections on the sexual theories of children and on pregenitality only appeared in 1915, for example, while such central terms as castration complex or penis envy were also later additions.

As Freud himself conceded in 1923, the result was that &quot;it may often have happened that what was old and what was more recent did not admit of being merged into an entirely uncontradictory whole&quot;, so that, whereas at first &quot;the accent was on a portrayal of the fundamental difference between the sexual life of children and of adults&quot;, subsequently &quot;we were able to recognize the far-reaching &quot;approximation of the final outcome of sexuality in children&quot; (in about the fifth year) to the definitive form taken by it in adults&quot;.

Jacques Lacan considered such a process of change as evidence of the way that &quot;Freud&#x27;s thought is the most perennially open to revision...a thought in motion&quot;.

===Translations===

There are three English translations, one by A. A. Brill in 1910, another by James Strachey in 1949 published by Imago Publishing. Strachey&#x27;s translation is generally considered superior, including by Freud himself. The third translation, by Ulrike Kistner, was published by Verso Books in 2017. Kistner&#x27;s translation is at the time of its publishing the only English translation available of the earlier 1905 edition of the Essays. The 1905 edition theorizes an autoerotic theory of sexual development, without recourse to the Oedipal complex.

==History==

The Pinhal de Leiria forest was first planted in the 13th century by Dom Afonso III and expanded by Dom Dinis as a barrier against the sands and to supply timber to the maritime industry. In October 2017, a large-scale forest fire devastated about 86% of the area planted with pine trees. Since there, a lot of efforts promoted by public and private entities have tried to reforest the burned vegetation, but most of the landscape is still ruined.
The Marinha Grande glass manufacturing industry was first established in the middle of the 18th century. The Royal Glass Factory (Real Fabrica de Vidros) was bought by an English entrepreneur William Stephens who developed the factory and the business under the protection of the Marques de Pombal. The wood from the pine forest was used to fuel the factories. The former palatial home of William Stephens now contains the Museu do Vidro da Marinha Grande which houses glassware from the 17th to the 20th century. In 1826, the factory was given to the state and became one of the country&#x27;s main producers of traditionally made fine crystal.

On 18 January 1934 there was insurrection in several locations of Portugal, in particular Marinha Grande, that aimed at taking down the authoritarian &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime. The trigger was legislation in 1933 that dissolved trade unions and banned strikes. The revolts were easily suppressed by the regime. The strikers in Marinha Grande suffered a particularly heavy punishment. When, two years later, the regime inaugurated the Tarrafal prison, in the Portuguese colony of Cape Verde, a third of the early prisoners came from Marinha Grande, and some would eventually die there due to the camp&#x27;s bad conditions.

==Economy==

Marinha Grande is Portugal&#x27;s biggest glass manufacturer, and it is also the European capital for the moulding industry, with 250 companies operating there, rightfully giving the town the nickname &#x27;The Crystal City&#x27;.

The city is served by two highways (A8 connecting to Lisbon and A17 connecting to Aveiro and Oporto) and a train line. It is a 1-hour 15-minute drive away from Lisbon, 10 minutes away from Leiria and 45 minutes from Coimbra.

==Tourism==

The pine forest is an aromatic forest and has waymarked paths for walkers. It has several campsites within it. There is a cycle route from Marinha Grande to São Pedro de Moel on the coast. There are tours around the glass works and to the glass museums.

==Sports==
Atlético Clube Marinhense is the local team, it plays at Estádio Municipal da Marinha Grande, a venue shared in past with former Primeira Liga club, U.D. Leiria.

<text>Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Pilette (; born 26 July 1942) is a former racing driver from Belgium. He participated in 4 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, the first on 12 May 1974 with Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Brabham team.

Son of André Pilette and grandson of Théodore Pilette, he followed the family path. He started his career by winning many go-kart races before being sent to England to the talent-spotting Jim Russell Racing School. This experience created the opportunity for him to be part of the cast for John Frankenheimer&#x27;s movie Grand Prix, and later on Le Mans with Steve McQueen.

On the circuit, Pilette raced for Carlo Abarth in 1963 and 1965, and in 1967 he started racing for the Belgian VDS team. He won the European Formula 5000 Championship in 1973 with a Chevron B24, and again in 1975 with a Lola T400. He also competed in the US in Formula 5000. He also made 3 attempts at the Indy 500. He attempted to qualify for the 1977 Indianapolis 500 but failed to make the field. He drove in the CART Championship Car race at Watkins Glen International in 1981 but retired after 14 laps due to gearbox failure. It would be his only Champ Car start as he failed to qualify for the 1982 Indianapolis 500 and 1983 Indianapolis 500 and was entered in the Cleveland Grand Prix later that year but the car was driven by Herm Johnson.

In 1977, Capparelli arranged for Pilette to drive with the dying BRM team in Formula One, and also in the Aurora AFX Formula One Championship the following year.

In sports cars Pilette won the Spa 24 Hours with a Ford Capri, in the last race on the long circuit in 1978.

In 1992 he formed the Pilette Speed Tradition Formula Ford team in Europe. In 1994 he built his own Formula Three car, the Pilette PWT 94C, and raced in the German Formula 3 championship with Paolo Coloni, without success.
In September 2013, he was elected vice president of the Grand Prix Drivers Club (formerly known as Club International des Anciens Pilotes de Grand-Prix F1).

<text>Reginald Harold Haslam &quot;Tim&quot; Parnell Jr. (25 June 1932 – 5 April 2017) was a British racing driver from England. He was the son of Reg Parnell, another racing driver.

He participated in four Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 July 1959, and qualified for two of them. He scored no championship points. His only finish was tenth place in the 1961 Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Parnell died on 5 April 2017 at the age of 84.

<text>Tom Belsø (27 August 1942 – 12 January 2020) was a motor racing driver, credited as the first Formula One driver from Denmark.

==Early career==
Belsø started out in touring cars, where he won his debut race and went on to become Scandinavian Touring Car Champion in 1969. He became a Formula Two racer in 1972, with his best result being a fourth place at the Albi Grand Prix, finishing 17th in the European F2 Championship. In 1973 he raced a Lola in Formula 5000. He also raced in a few non-championship Formula One races, finishing 7th in the 1973 Race of Champions and 8th in the 1973 BRDC International Trophy, and retiring in the 1974 BRDC International Trophy and 1975 Race of Champions. He contested the 1974 Rothmans 5000 European Championship winning at Snetterton and finishing 8th in the Series. He also competed in the 1977 Shellsport 5000/Libre series and finished fifth in a Radio Luxemburg-sponsored Lola T330-Chevrolet.

==Formula One==
Belsø qualified a Formula One Iso-Marlboro for the Frank Williams Racing Cars team at the 1973 Swedish Grand Prix, but could not start the race because his sponsorship money did not arrive. In 1974 he tried four times to qualify for Williams, but was only successful in South Africa and Sweden. In South Africa, the clutch on Belsø&#x27;s FW failed on the first lap of the race. In Sweden, he finished his only complete Grand Prix, in eighth place.

<text>Thomas Bridger (24 June 1934 – 30 July 1991) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, on 19 October 1958, scoring no championship points. His greatest success came in Formula Three, where he won 15 races.

==Career==

Born in Woolmer Green, Hertfordshire, Bridger started racing in Formula Three in 1953, initially competing minor events in a Kieft-Norton before moving to a Cooper to compete full-time in Formula Three in 1957. He achieved some success racing with Jim Russell, one of the more successful drivers in the category.

Bridger raced in the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix with British Racing Partnership, driving a Formula Two-class Cooper T45. He qualified in 22nd place, and Bridger got up to 14th before his race was ended by a collision on lap 30. The crash involved three vehicles, but Bridger emerged unharmed.

He returned to Formula Three in 1959 with the Cooper-Norton car, winning four races throughout the year. In 1960, he raced in Formula Junior, competing in a works Lotus at the British Grand Prix.

<text>Tomáš Enge (; born 11 September 1976) is a Czech former professional racing driver who has competed in many classes of motorsport, including three races in Formula One.

==Career==
Born in Liberec, Enge started his career at the age of 16, entering a Ford Fiesta he bought with his own money in the Czechoslovakian Ford Fiesta Cup. 

Enge participated in the final three races of the Formula One season, becoming the first, and to date only, driver from the Czech Republic to compete in Formula One. He made his debut at the Italian Grand Prix on 16 September, after being brought in by Prost as a replacement for Luciano Burti, who was recovering from his crash at the previous race in Belgium. Enge left the Prost Grand Prix team before it folded for the 2002 season.

He obtained his Formula One break using the sponsorship from the local Coca-Cola subsidiary, which had also funded the Nordic Racing F3000 team he raced for that year. He finished third in the 2001 standings despite missing the final race, and was stripped of the 2002 title due to a positive marijuana test. He returned to Formula 3000 in 2004, and then headed to America for 2005, driving for Panther Racing in the IRL, with modest success, although almost winning the race at Sonoma. Among his 17 career IRL starts was his rookie start in the 2005 Indianapolis 500. He then drove for Team Czech Republic in the 2005-2006 A1GP season. Enge has also been a frequent driver for Prodrive&#x27;s sportscar teams, driving both their Ferrari 550 Maranellos and Aston Martin DBR9s in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2006 he was driver of the #007 Aston Martin Racing entry in the American Le Mans Series, but for 2007 switched to the Petersen/White Lightning Ferrari F430.

On 31 March 2007, Enge was injured whilst driving his F430 at the ALMS St. Petersburg race. The car crashed whilst leading the GT2 class, suffering heavy damage to the driver&#x27;s side and a brief fire. Enge was removed under medical supervision and transported to the local medical centre. He was later revealed to have suffered a shattered elbow, cracked ribs, a partially collapsed lung and a potentially broken ankle, but not to be in any serious danger.

On 21 July 2007, Enge was released from his contract with Peterson Motorsports/White Lightning Racing due to a penalty incurred after crashing into Mika Salo during the Acura Sports Car Challenge ALMS race at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.

In 2009 he drove for Aston Martin Racing in the Le Mans Series and won the championship alongside Stefan Mücke and Jan Charouz. He remained with Aston Martin, as he moved into the FIA GT1 World Championship for the 2010 season, joining Darren Turner at Young Driver AMR. The pairing finished fourth in the championship with three victories. Enge and Turner were split for the 2011 season; Turner was joined by Stefan Mücke, while Enge was partnered by Alex Müller. Enge and Müller achieved two victories as they finished fourth in the championship.

With Young Driver AMR pulling out of the championship to focus on other series, Enge moved to the Reiter Engineering Lamborghini squad for the 2012 season, where he partnered socialite Albert von Thurn und Taxis. The pairing were lying tenth in the championship after four rounds; their best result was a second-place finish at the Slovakia Ring. On 19 June 2012, it was announced that Enge had tested positive for a banned substance at the Navarra round of the championship, and was suspended from racing. At the beginning of August, it was announced that Enge was to be suspended from racing for 18 months. Enge appealed the decision on the grounds that the positive test was caused by medication he is taking for a chronic cardiovascular condition. In April 2013 the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected Enge&#x27;s appeal.

<text>Thomas Byrne (born 6 May 1958) is a former racing driver from Ireland. He participated in two Formula One Grands Prix in with the backmarker Theodore team, failing to qualify for another three. He failed to finish in either of the Grands Prix he started and scored no Formula One championship points.

After performing well in the Irish Formula Ford Championship in 1981, Byrne won the 1982 British Formula 3 Championship even though he missed some races while he competed in Formula One. At that time, he also tested a McLaren MP4/1 Formula One car in October 1982 against Marlboro-backed Spirit Racing&#x27;s European F2 drivers like Stefan Johansson and Thierry Boutsen. During this test he set a time quicker than the works drivers, Watson and Lauda, despite the car being specifically detuned for him and not the other drivers at the test. After a brief return to Formula Three in 1983, where he raced for Eddie Jordan, Byrne moved to the United States and began racing in the American Racing Series in 1986, where he won ten races in 55 starts, both second place in the series record books. He also was the championship runner-up in 1988 and 1989. He raced in the series until 1992 and then retired. Despite his extended career in the States, Byrne never made a Champ Car start. He lives in Florida, and teaches Honda Teen/Adult Defensive Driving, Advanced Defensive Driving, Acura High Performance and Acura Advanced Performance Driving during the race season at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. He is also a driver coach for Indy Lights team Brian Stewart Racing.
He co-authored a book with Mark Hughes which was released in the UK on 8 August 2008, titled &quot;Crashed and Byrned: The Greatest Racing Driver You Never Saw&quot;. The book won the William Hill Irish Sports Book of the Year for 2009.

Byrne was the subject of Seán Ó Cualáin&#x27;s documentary &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; in 2016.

<doc id="1235672" wikidata="Q61832" url="?curid=1235672" title="Toni Ulmen">
<text>Anton &quot;Toni&quot; Ulmen (25 January 1906 – 4 November 1976) was a German motorcycle and racing driver from Düsseldorf, Germany. His racing career started in 1925 on a 250 cc Velocette. In 1927 he won the opening race of the Nürburgring on a 350 cc Velocette. In 1929 he won the 350 cc class on the Eilenriede, a non-permanent race course near Hannover. From 1949 to 1952, he was four times German sports car and Formula 2 champion.

==Craftsman, businessman and racer==

After leaving school, Ulmen served an apprenticeship as a machinist with Motorradwerkstatt Hasenclever. When he finished there, he founded Gebrüder Ulmen, with his brother Andreas. They become the representatives of Opel for Düsseldorf.

It was in 1925 that Ulmen began his career in motorsport, at the Großen Deutschland-Rundfahrt on a 250cc Velocette motor cycle. Two years later can riding a 350 cc Velocette he won the first Eifelrennen, to claim the Deutsche Tourist-Trophäe, the inaugural race held on the Nürburgring. In 1929, he won another major German race, the 350cc race of Eilenridederennens in Hanover. By 1930, Ulmen was a works rider for NSU.

==After the War==

After the war, he turned to car racing, taking a second place in his first major sportscar race, the Karlsruhe-Durlach, abroad a BMW 328. A year later, in 1947 he was awarded the title of best German sports car driver of the year.

The 1949 season saw Ulmen win nine races, including the Solituderennen and the DMV Grenzlandringrennen. He was won races at München, Nürburgring, Sachsenring and Kölner Kurs. He also recorded seven second place that season. 1950 saw the first Großer Preis von Deutschland after World War II, at the Nürburgring, where he finished fourth in his open-wheel Veritas RS. In this car, he also recorded a surprising third place in the Preis der Ostechweiz-Erlen in Switzerland, beaten only by the Scuderia Ferraris of Luigi Villoresi and Roberto Vallone. Prior to 1950, there was a ban on German cars and drivers completing in foreign events, after the war. He retained his German Champion title, he first won in 1949.

With victories at Hockenheim, the Schauinsland Hillclimb, and the Grenzlandring, Ulmen was clear champion in the 2-litre Sports Car class. He participated in two World Championship Grands Prix in 1952, debuting on 18 May 1952, in the Grosser Preis der Schweiz, but retired due to fuel tank issues. He returned for the Großer Preis von Deutschland, where despite his Veritas&#x27;s power disadvantage compared to his rivals, his finished eighth. That season also saw Ulmen win the DMV Grenalandringrennen again. During the season, he suffered a heavy crash during a practise session on the Sachsenring from which he escaped almost unscathed. He arrived at the final meeting of the 1952 season, the Avusrennen, as leader in the Formula 2 class and 2-litre sport cars. On the AVUS, lost a dramatic slipstream battle with fellow Veritas driver, Fritz Rieß, on the penultimate lap. This meant both drivers were equal on points, and according to the DMV regulations, Rieß was declared champion, as he had scored the better at the Eifelrennen. As consolidation, Ulmen was awarded the Formula 2 title, despite the fact he could take part in this race. After that he competed only occasionally in car races.

Despite his retirement early 1953, Ulmen was soon, albeit briefly, behind the wheel, sharing a Jaguar D-Type with Herman Roosdorp to third place in his only 24-hour endurance race, the 1953 24 Heures de Spa Francorchamps.

==Away from the track==

Following his racing retirement, Ulmen become president of the Deutscher Motorsport Verband (DMW) and he received the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt award from President of Germany, Theodor Heuss for his successes in motorsport, the highest national award in Germany for an athlete.

<text>The Basingstoke Bison are an English Ice Hockey club from Basingstoke. They currently compete in the NIHL National League and have previously been members of the Ice Hockey Superleague and its successor the Elite Ice Hockey League. Unfortunately due to arena refurbishment/renovation the team is unable to compete in the upcoming 2023/24 Season

== History ==
Formed in 1988 as the Basingstoke Beavers, the club became the &quot;Bison&quot; in 1995. Their team logo is very similar to the &quot;Goathead&quot; used by the Buffalo Sabres from 1996 to 2006. Joining the Superleague in 1996, the Bison dropped out in 1998 and joined the British National League. In 2003 they joined the newly formed Elite Ice Hockey League.

Despite being one of the lower-budget teams in the EIHL, the Bison maintained their fan base and greatly enhanced local sponsorships and doubled their season ticket sales. This success is mainly testament to the hard work of Mark Bernard, who occupied the general manager and head coach role with the club during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons. Bernard also stepped into the netminder&#x27;s role part way through the latter season after Jayme Platt had left the team.

In May 2006, Bernard left the club to take up the assistant general manager&#x27;s post with American Hockey League club, the Norfolk Admirals. Prior to his departure, Bernard secured the services of a number of the players that made up the 05/06 roster.

In June 2006, Planet Ice announced that the new player/coach of the club would be former club captain Doug Sheppard, with former Bison and London Racers defenceman Duncan Dalmao returning as player/assistant coach. Sheppard set about building his roster around the core that he had inherited from Bernard. The Bison embarked upon a successful year under Sheppard, securing their highest ever Elite League finish, and taking many points off the top sides in the League.

In April 2007, David Taylor, owner of the Bracknell Bees, purchased the Bison. He appointed Ryan Aldridge as the head coach of the team, signalling the end of Doug Shepherd&#x27;s reign. Shepherd went on to join rivals Sheffield Steelers.

Following financial problems, which had resulted in the departure of a number of players (including starting netminder Stevie Lyle), Taylor relinquished ownership of the Bison and the team&#x27;s new owner was announced as Tomas Enerston by Planet Ice on 8 November 2007. Less than a year later, following further financial difficulty, Planet Ice put together a rescue package to keep Bison on the ice until the end of the 2008/09 season.

On 25 March 2009, the Bison released a statement confirming that they would be joining the EPL for the 2009/10 season. Entry to the EPIHL was confirmed on 15 April 2009, and Steve Moria took over as head coach the following day.

After Moria&#x27;s departure at the end of the 2011–2012 season, it was announced that Doug Sheppard would return as the Bison head coach for the 2012–2013 season. In March 2013, Sheppard signed another deal with the Basingstoke Bison to continue as head coach for the 2013–2014 season.

The Basingstoke Bison won the 15/16 English Premier League title, under Doug Sheppard as coach. This ended their silverware drought of 23 years.
The 2017/18 season was arguably the Bison&#x27;s greatest ever season. Remaining under Doug Sheppard, they secured a historic treble by winning the NIHL 1 South league, NIHL 1 South playoffs and finally the NIHL Final Four playoffs.

In 2018/19, the Bison had a major squad rebuild, with just 7 players remaining at the club from the previous season. With Doug Sheppard joining rivals Bracknell Bees, the Bison brought in British ice hockey veteran Ashley Tait as a player-coach. With Coventry Blaze legend Russell Cowley and imports Richard Bordowski and Michal Klejna, the Bison achieved an unlikely 3rd place finish in the league, and made their way to the cup final, which they lost to the Peterborough Phantoms.

Basingstoke announced they would sit out the 2023/24 NIHL season due to rink upgrade works.

==Honoured members==
Basingstoke have only retired the number of two players, the first being Kevin Conway&#x27;s number 10 in 2005 following his initial retirement from ice hockey. In the 2005–06 season, Tony Redmond was honoured with a testimonial season. In September 2009, it was announced that Don Yewchin, the original ice hockey coordinator for the Beavers in 1988 would have his number 12 jersey retired before Basingstoke&#x27;s league game with local rivals Bracknell Bees on Saturday 10 October 2009. In a fantastic twist of fate, Basingstoke won the game 12–0. In 2016, Tony Redmond&#x27;s number 20 shirt was retired when the club beat Telford Tigers 7-0. In 2018, the club held a testimonial match to celebrate Kurt Reynolds, as he took a time-out from hockey.

<text>Thomas Anthony Donald Crook (16 February 1920 – 21 January 2014) was a racing driver from England. He was born in Manchester and educated at Clifton College, Bristol. He participated in two Formula 2 Grand Prix races counting towards the World Championship of Drivers, debuting on 19 July 1952. He scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-championship races.

Crook had a successful career as a racing driver outside of Formula 2 amassing nearly 400 win or place finishes between 1946 and 1955. His career ended after an accident that season, but he had been planning to retire in 1955 anyway. In his capacity as a motor dealer in Surrey Crook specialised in Bristols and became part owner of the Bristol company in 1960, before taking full ownership in 1973. He retained the sole ownership of Bristol Cars until 1997 and part ownership until 2002 but remained with the company until his retirement in 2007.

<text>Frederick Anthony Owen Gaze, (3 February 1920 – 29 July 2013) was an Australian fighter pilot and racing driver. He flew with the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, was a flying ace credited with 12.5 confirmed victories (11 and 3 shared), and later enjoyed a successful racing career in the UK, Europe and Australia. He was the first ever Australian to take part in a Formula One Grand Prix.

==Early life==
Gaze was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 20 February 1920, the son of Irvine Gaze, a member of the Ross Sea Party who were preparing for Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s expedition. He was educated at Geelong Grammar School, and when war was declared in September 1939 he was a student at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

==Military service==
===First success===
Gaze joined the RAF in 1940, and on completion of training and with 122 hours flying time recorded was posted to No. 610 Squadron RAF at RAF Westhampnett in March 1941, flying cross-channel fighter sweeps. Gaze&#x27;s first &#x27;kill&#x27; came on 26 June when he downed a Messerschmitt Bf 109. The next month he claimed two further victories, one half and two probables. For these victories he was awarded the first of three DFCs. His brother, Pilot Officer Scott Gaze had joined No. 610 Squadron RAF with him in early 1941, but was killed in action on 23 March 1941. In November 1941 Gaze was posted to No. 57 OTU as an instructor.

He started his second tour in June 1942, with No. 616 Squadron RAF, flying the high altitude Spitfire Mk.VI. During the ill-fated Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942, he received his second DFC after destroying an enemy fighter. In late August 1942 he was posted to command No. 64 Squadron RAF flying the new Spitfire IX.

===Demotion and escape after being shot down===
On 26 September 1942 Gaze led a wing of Spitfires in support of a bombing raid at Morlaix. An Eagle Squadron, No. 133 Squadron RAF, became scattered in high winds and lost 11 of 12 fighters. Gaze was made the scapegoat for the mission failure and was transferred back to No. 616 Squadron as a flight commander. It was later determined that the causes of the high losses on that mission were pilot inexperience and unexpected adverse weather.

After a rest from operations in early 1943, he was again posted to an operational Squadron in August 1943, No. 66 Squadron RAF at RAF Kenley. On 4 September 1943 over Le Tréport after downing a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Gaze&#x27;s own Spitfire V was shot down by Heinz-Gerhard Vogt of II./JG 26 (his 14th claim of an eventual 48). Gaze crash landed 20 miles from Dieppe with slight injuries, evaded capture and made his way, with help from the French Resistance, to neutral Spain.

===Back to Britain===
In February 1944 Gaze joined the Air Fighting Development Unit (ADFU) at Wittering, rejoining No. 610 Squadron on the continent in July 1944. He claimed a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet shot down near Emmrich on Rhine on 14 February 1945 (a Me 262A-2 of I./KG 51 flown by Rudolf Hoffmann) (the first Australian to achieve this feat) and shared an Arado Ar 234 jet bomber on 12 April 1945.

The Me 262 victory resulted in Gaze being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the third time; one of only 47 men in the Second World War.

After a month with No. 41 Squadron RAF in April, on 2 May 1945 he was posted as a flight commander to No. 616 squadron, becoming one of the first Australians (after F/O JN McKay, RAAF) to fly the Gloster Meteor in combat during the closing stages of the war.

During the war he had also flown with some of the most famous names including Wing Commander Douglas Bader, top Allied ace Johnnie Johnson (38 victories) as part of the RAF&#x27;s Tangmere Wing and Paul Tibbets, pilot of the &#x27;Enola Gay&#x27;, B29 Bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.

==List of air victories==
Gaze ended the war as Australia&#x27;s tenth ranking highest ace, claiming 12.5 confirmed destroyed (11 and 3 shared (note: below list includes the destruction of a V1)), 4 probables, and 5 damaged in 488 combat missions, all while flying Supermarine Spitfires of various Marks.


==Racing driver==
In 1946, Gaze suggested to the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, better known as &quot;Freddie March&quot;, that the roads around RAF Westhampnett would be a good location for a racing track. Acting on this suggestion, March opened the Goodwood Circuit in 1948.

Gaze returned to Australia after the war, and began racing an Alta racing car that he brought with him.

He raced an Alta Formula 2 in Europe for the 1951 season, switching to an HWM-Alta for the following season, planning to racing again in F2. When the sport&#x27;s governing body decided to change the World Championship regulations from Formula One to Formula 2, Gaze’s plans changed as well. He took part in a number of non-championship F1 events, and then in June travelled to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps for the Grote Prijs van Belgie. After qualifying the HWM-Alta 16th, he raced one place better, attaining 15th place. By racing in Spa, Gaze became the first Australian to contest a World Championship motor race. This was followed by appearances in the RAC British Grand Prix and the Groβer Preis von Deutschland, although he failed to qualify for the Gran Premio d’Italia.

The following year, he was a member of the first Australian crew to attempt the Rallye Monte Carlo in a Holden FX with Lex Davison and Stan Jones. At one point, the trio was in the top ten, but finished the event in 64th. Also that season, he raced an Aston Martin DB3 in sports car events across Europe, and survived an accident in the Grande Prémio de Portugal, when his car struck a tree after a collision with a Ferrari. He was thrown clear as the Aston flipped over and burst into flames. Gaze was carried to safety by spectators, and suffered only cuts and bruises.

In 1954 and 1955, Gaze raced the ex-Ascari Ferrari 500 F2 in non-championship events in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. On his return to England, he set up the Kangaroo Stable, the first Australian international racing team. One team member was a young Jack Brabham. They ran Aston Martin DB3S. However, many races were cancelled after the Le Mans disaster, and the Stable disbanded at the end of the season. Gaze continued to race for another season.

==Gliding==
After a conversation with Prince Bira, who was an avid glider competitor, Gaze tried his hand at the sport. He became an active member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Gliding Club, at Nympsfield and went on to represent Australia in the 1960 World Gliding Championships, which was held at the Butzweiler airfield, near Köln.

==Personal life==
Tony Gaze was married twice; to Kay Wakefield who died in 1976 and to fellow racing car driver Diana Davison who died in 2012. Davison was the widow of Lex Davison. Gaze was also step-grandfather to the third generation of Davison racing drivers, Alex, Will and James.

<text>Major Anthony Peter Roylance Rolt, MC &amp; Bar, (16 October 1918 – 6 February 2008) was a British racing driver, soldier and engineer. A war hero, Rolt maintained a long connection with the sport, albeit behind the scenes. The Ferguson 4WD project he was involved in paid off with spectacular results, and he was involved in other engineering projects.

At his death, he was the longest surviving participant of the first ever World Championship Grand Prix at Silverstone in 1950. He was one of the last prewar winners remaining too – he won the 1939 British Empire Trophy, aged just 20 in 1939 – this was after he started his career in 1935, as a 16-year-old, in a 3-wheeler Morgan in speed trials. He won the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans and participated in three Formula One World Championship Grands Prix.

==Early life and prewar racing==

Rolt was born in Bordon, Hampshire, and brought up at St Asaph in Denbighshire, Wales. He was the fourth child of Brigadier-General Stuart Rolt, and educated at Eton, where he got into trouble for keeping a car.
He began competing while at Eton, in a Morgan three-wheeler in their trials before, in 1936, making his track début sharing a Triumph Gloria Vitesse with Jack Elliott in the Spa 24 Hours, where the pair finished 11th, fourth in class. He drove there because he had just lost his British driving licence for speeding along Denbigh High Street. Throughout 1937, he raced the Triumph Dolomite, winning the Coronation Trophy, before acquiring the famous ERA &quot;Remus&quot; from his fellow Old Etonians, the Siamese princes, Chula Chakrabongse and Bira Birabongse.

In a minor race at Brooklands, a bolt dropped from the ERA’s exhaust and flames began swirling around Rolt’s lap; he removed his gloves, stuffed one across the hole and won the race. For 1939, he acquired another ERA, immediately winning the 200-mile British Empire Trophy race at Donington Park.

==Second World War==

He entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1939 received a commission in the Rifle Brigade. During the Second World War, Rolt was a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade and in 1940 was sent to France, where he was in charge of a reconnaissance platoon. He was soon in the thick of the fighting and helped defend Calais. The men defending Calais held for three days trying to stop the 10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht) from advancing, and in doing so delaying their attack on Dunkirk. He was captured and taken prisoner of war at the end of the battle for Calais, just before the Dunkirk evacuation. For his actions, he was awarded the Military Cross: his exploits included helping a wounded comrade while firing his Bren gun at the advancing German troops.

Rolt escaped seven times from German prisoner-of-war camps including Laufen (Oflag VII-C), Biberach (Oflag V-B), Posen (Stalag XXI-D), Warburg (Oflag VI-B) and Eichstätt (Oflag VII-B), before eventually being sent to the maximum security prison, Oflag IV-C in Colditz Castle on 14 July 1943. In one attempt to escape, he got within yards of the Swiss border before being recaptured – which accounted for his transfer to the East German fortress. For his determined escape attempts, Rolt was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross. In early 1944, he was one of the masterminds behind the audacious glider escape plan, but in spring 1945, the US army liberated the castle, obviating the need for it.

After the war Rolt resigned his commission with the rank of Major to develop advanced automotive technologies.

==Racing career==

After the war Rolt resumed racing with an Alfa Romeo Bimotore, in which he took a fine second place in the 1948 Zandvoort GP. Between 1949 and 1952, he began a close association with Freddie Dixon and Rob Walker, setting an engineering partnership with the former and racing Walker’s 1926 Delage and Delahaye. In 1950 and 1951, he shared a Nash-Healey, with Duncan Hamilton, on both occasions, finishing fourth and sixth at Le Mans. From 1952 to 1955, Rolt raced Walker’s dark-blue Connaughts in which he was tremendously successful in English national events, winning numerous Formula Two, Formula Libre and handicap races. Unfortunately, his business obliged him to restrict his racing. Also, in 1952 came the most significant move of his racing career; he was invited to join the Jaguar team, &quot;”I’d proved quite competitive at Dundrod where I actually lapped the C-Type faster than Stirling [Moss]. Then they asked me who I’d like as my co-driver and I said Duncan. They said &quot;Duncan, you must be mad!” but he joined me in the team for 1952 and we always drove in long distance races together&quot;. &quot;. Their first Le Mans together for Jaguar was a disaster, which resulted in a head gasket failure and an early retirement.

==Grand Prix racer==

Rolt competed in three Formula One World Championship races, the British Grands Prix of 1950, 1953, &amp; 1955, but all three outings ended in retirement. At the 1950 British Grand Prix, the first-ever round of the F1 World Championship, he started 10th on the grid in an ERA that had been qualified by Peter Walker, but the gearbox failed after four laps. In the 1953 race, once again he started from 10th, but a half shaft on his Connaught failed after 70 laps. In his final Grand Prix, he again shared a drive with Walker in 1955. In what was to be the last F1 outing for both drivers: their Connaught started 14th and retired with transmission trouble after 18 laps. Stirling Moss asserts that Rolt would have been among the top GP drivers, if he raced regularly.

==Called from the Bar==
Rolt competed in every 24 Heures du Mans race from 1949 to 1955, famously winning the 1953 event in a Jaguar C-Type shared with Hamilton. Initially, the pairing were disqualified for practising in a Jaguar that had the same racing number as another on the circuit at the same time, but they were reinstated. Hamilton&#x27;s account has become a motor racing legend: when Jaguar team manager Lofty England persuaded the organisers to let them race, both drivers were already drunk in a local bar. England said: &quot;”Of course I would never have let them race under the influence. I had enough trouble when they were sober!” &quot;

The Rolt/Hamilton partnership continued in 1954, where they finished second to a works Scuderia Ferrari, in a Jaguar D-Type. This was despite an incident during a hail storm, Rolt realised that he could not see properly, so he pitted for a visor, but as a Ferrari was in its pit, the team waved him out again. When Rolt pitted again the next lap, his goggles were &quot;full of water&quot;. He hopped out of the car to fix on a visor and Hamilton jumped into the car and was away. Having made up a four-lap deficit, the Rolt/Hamilton D-Type finished less than four kilometres behind the victorious Ferrari. They also finished second for Jaguar in the 12 heures internationals – Voiture Sport Reims, but retired from the 1955 Les 24 Heures du Mans while running in second place. Rolt and his wife, Lois witnessed the disaster that year, which claimed more than 80 lives after Pierre Levegh&#x27;s Mercedes left the track and ploughed into spectators. Thereafter, he concentrated on his engineering. By the end of 1956, although still a member of the Jaguar works team, Rolt retired from active racing to devote his full efforts to the Ferguson development programme.

==Engineering career==

After the war, Rolt returned to form part of Rolt Dixon Research, with his mechanic, Freddie Dixon, to work on an idea that they had considered before the war: four-wheel drive. The company they formed also pioneered the viscous coupling. This eventually led to backing from tractor magnate Harry Ferguson and gave rise to the development of the Ferguson P99 four-wheel drive F1 car. Rolt subsequently built Indianapolis 500 track-racing 4WD cars for the American STP Corporation, and Ferguson transmissions appeared in the Lotus 56, Novi-Ferguson and STP-Paxton Turbocar Indy Cars of 1964 to 1969. With the technical director Claude Hill and the project engineer Derek Gardner, Rolt was among the unsung backroom heroes of British racing development. When Ferguson Development closed, Rolt founded FF Developments in 1971, converting cars, vans and ambulances to four-wheel drive. During the 1980s, major automotive manufacturers finally saw advantages in all-wheel drive technology, and the company became a major technology partner of Ford, Chrysler, Audi, Fiat and General Motors.

In 1994, the business was sold to Ricardo, who continued the development of &quot;smart&quot; transmissions using Rolt FFD and Ferguson experience. Rolt was immensely proud that the Audi sports cars that have dominated the 24 Heures du Mans and the American Le Mans Series endurance championships since 2000 used Ricardo transmissions.

===The F1 Tractor===
By the early 1960s Rolt and FF Developments had decided that it would build a 4WD racing car to demonstrate the value of four-wheel drive technology. Rolt helped to design, and also tested the Ferguson P99. Although Rolt was more than capable of driving the car fast enough for test purposes, Jack Fairman was called in to race it in the 1961 British Empire Trophy and 1961 RAC British Grand Prix at Aintree, proving without doubt the four-wheel drive allied to the Dunlop Maxaret braking system was substantially superior in the wet. The P99 was run under the banner of Rob Walker Racing and became the only 4WD car to win a Formula One race, when in the hands of Stirling Moss it won the 1961 Oulton Park Gold Cup. The car was also the last front-engined car ever to win a F1 race. Despite a trip the Tasman Series and success in the hands Peter Westbury, when he won the British Hill Climb Championship in 1964, the car was not used much again. Subsequently the four-wheel-drive concept succeeded in the United States and in 1966 was built into the Jensen FF road car.

Rolt was a very private man, but had great charm and presence. He also had the dignity to shun personal publicity, and the notion that he had done something heroic in trying to escape from Colditz never crossed his mind. He avoided Colditz reunions. He simply saw it as his duty to make escape attempts and was quick to emphasise that there was nothing light-hearted about those efforts, and would say &quot;”Escaping was not a game. Nor was it fun. It was a duty&quot; &quot;. He gained much satisfaction from shooting and skiing. Lois and his daughter, Nikki, predeceased him, but he was survived by his other daughter Angela, and sons David and Stuart, the latter of whom raced Saloon cars in the 1970s and served as chairman of the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC).

He was the last surviving driver from that inaugural World Championship Grand Prix held at Silverstone; also the last pre-World War member of the prestigious BRDC, having been elected in 1936.

<text>Anthony Lionel Shelly (2 February 1937 – 4 October 1998) was a racing driver from New Zealand. He competed in Formula One in , participating in 3 World Championship Grands Prix, and several non-Championship races. He scored no World Championship points. He also owned a BMW dealership called Shelly Motors in Honolulu. The business had previously belonged to Shelly&#x27;s father and had been sold on his death. Shelly subsequently re-acquired the business and became an American citizen in 1975. He divided his time between a home in Honolulu and one in New Zealand, where he died.

==Career==
Shelly made his motor racing debut in January 1955, entering a Morgan in the Sports Car class for the New Zealand Grand Prix. Shelly qualified but did not start the race. Shelly won &quot;the first big race he contested&quot; at Teretonga in 1958 driving a Cooper and went on to become a leading driver in Australia and New Zealand before moving to race in Europe in 1962. He drove mainly for John Dalton, usually in non-championship events with moderate success, a fifth in the Lombank Trophy and a third in the Lavant Cup being the highlights of his season. He was entered to 1962 Le Mans in June by Colin Chapman to co-drive with Les Leston with a Lotus 23, but the race organizer, ACO, denied the entry in the famous Lotus Le Mans debacle. He also entered three Formula One World championship events, at Aintree, where he retired with a failed cylinder head gasket, and at the Nürburgring and Monza, where he failed to qualify on each occasion. At the end of the season he returned to New Zealand where he continued to race in 1963 and 1964 following which he retired, although he did compete occasionally thereafter.

<doc id="1235696" wikidata="Q497141" url="?curid=1235696" title="No Kum-sok">
<text>No Kum-sok (; January 10, 1932 – December 26, 2022) was a North Korean-born American engineer and aviator who served as a senior lieutenant in the Korean People&#x27;s Army Air and Anti-Air Force during the Korean War. Under colonial rule, No was required to adopt a Japanese name, Okamura Kiyoshi. Approximately two months after the end of hostilities, he defected to South Korea in a MiG-15 aircraft, and was subsequently granted political asylum in the United States. He then adopted the English name Kenneth H. Rowe.

==Early life and education==

No was born on January 10, 1932 in Shinko, Kankyōnan-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan (now in North Korea).

During World War II, No supported Japan and considered becoming a kamikaze pilot, but his father was adamantly against it. No&#x27;s support for Imperial Japan waned and he became pro-Western, though he had to hide these views due to the dangers of being recognized in northern Korea at the time.

According to No, he attended a speech by Kim Il Sung in early 1948 as a teenager; although No was opposed to communism, he found Kim to be a capable orator. However, No had to keep his anti-Communist views hidden, due to the danger of what would happen if North Korean authorities had found out about them.

==Career==

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, No applied to join the Korean People&#x27;s Navy and was accepted after he lied in the selection test. At the naval academy, No won the favor of his history professor who later helped No in the pilot selection test. After passing the selection test, No was promoted to ensign, and brought to Manchuria for flight training. He subsequently received promotion to the rank of lieutenant and then to senior lieutenant. He flew more than 100 combat missions during the war.

===Defection===

On the morning of September 21, 1953, No flew his Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 from Sunan just outside Pyongyang to Kimpo Air Base in South Korea. The time from take-off in North Korea to landing in South Korea was 17 minutes, with the MiG reaching . During the flight, he was not chased by North Korean aircraft (as he was too far away), nor was he interdicted by American air or ground forces; U.S. radar near Kimpo had been shut down temporarily that morning for routine maintenance. No landed the wrong way on the runway, almost hitting an F-86 Sabre jet landing at the same time from the opposite direction. Captain Dave William veered out of the way and exclaimed over the radio &quot;It&#x27;s a goddamn MiG!&quot;. Another American pilot, Captain Jim Sutton, who was circling the airport, said that if No had tried to land in the right direction, he would have been spotted and shot down. No taxied the MiG into a free parking spot between two Sabre jets, got out of the plane and began tearing up a picture of Kim Il Sung that was placed in the cockpits of North Korean aircraft, and then threw up his arms in surrender at approaching airbase security guards.

After being taken into custody and debriefed by CIA operative &quot;Andy Brown&quot; (born Arseny Yankovsky, son of Yuri Yankovsky), No received a $100,000 () reward offered by Operation Moolah for being the first pilot to defect with an operational aircraft, which he said he never heard of prior to his defection. No explained that North Korean pilots were not allowed to listen to South Korean radio, the leaflets broadcasting the award were not dropped in Manchuria where the pilots were based, and even if they had heard about the reward, the pilots would not have understood the purchasing power of the US dollar; he said the program would have been more effective if they had offered a good job and residence in North America. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was against paying defectors.

===No&#x27;s MiG-15===

After No surrendered his aircraft, it was taken to Okinawa, where it was given USAF markings and test-flown by Captain H.E. Collins and Major Chuck Yeager. The MiG-15 was later shipped to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base after a U.S. offer to return it to its rightful owner was ignored. It is currently on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

==Post-defection life==
In 1954, No immigrated to the United States, where he met Vice President Richard Nixon. After immigrating, he anglicized his name to &quot;Kenneth H. Rowe&quot;. In 1957, he was joined in the U.S. by his mother, who had defected to South Korea earlier in 1951. He subsequently graduated from the University of Delaware with degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering. He married an émigré from Kaesong, North Korea; they raised two sons and a daughter, and he became a U.S. citizen. He worked as an aeronautical engineer for Grumman, Boeing, Pan Am, General Dynamics, General Motors, General Electric, Lockheed, DuPont, and Westinghouse.

There were repercussions for No&#x27;s defection. In the 1970s, according to Captain Lee Un-yong, a Korean People&#x27;s Army Air and Anti-Air Force flight instructor who defected to South Korea two years after No, General Wan-yong, the top commander of the Korean People&#x27;s Army Air and Anti-Air Force, was demoted, and five of No&#x27;s air force comrades and commanders were executed. One of those killed was Lieutenant Kun Soo-sung, No&#x27;s best friend and fellow pilot. No&#x27;s parents would have also been punished for their son&#x27;s defection, but his father was already dead (having been killed in the Korean War) and his mother had already defected to the South. The fate of No&#x27;s uncle and the rest of his family remains unknown.

One of the pilots and a friend in his squadron, O Kuk-ryol, became a General and was considered by some the second most powerful man in North Korea.

In 1996, he wrote and published a book, &quot;A MiG-15 to Freedom&quot;, about his defection and previous life in North Korea. No retired in 2000 after working 17 years as an aeronautical engineering professor at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University. A biography of No by Blaine Harden was published in 2015 as &quot;The Great Leader and the Fighter Pilot: The True Story of the Tyrant Who Created North Korea and The Young Lieutenant Who Stole His Way to Freedom&quot;. Harden had interviewed No and access to newly released intelligence about him.

==Personal life==
No spoke fluent English, Japanese, and Korean. He lived in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he died on December 26, 2022, at the age of 90. No stated that he never second-guessed his decision to defect from North Korea and make a new life in America.

At the time of his death, No was surrounded by his wife, daughter, younger son and one grandson.

<text>John Trevor Blokdyk (30 November 1935 – 19 March 1995) was a South African motorcycle speedway rider and Formula One driver who participated in two World Championship Grands Prix, although qualifying for only one. He earned 6 caps for the South Africa national speedway team.

==Career==
Blokdyk rode in speedway in Britain in the late 1950s and early 1960s for Poole Pirates and Ipswich Witches. In 1962 he signed for Leicester Hunters but after one match for the team announced that he was quitting speedway to concentrate on motor racing.

Blokdyk competed in Formula One for the first time in the non-Championship Rand Grand Prix at Kyalami in 1961, in a Cooper, but spun out early on. He was more successful at his next race, the Natal Grand Prix at Westmead, where he finished eighth.

Coventry Bees attempted to sign him from Ipswich Witches in June 1962 but failed to contact him to seal the transfer.

In late 1962, Blokdyk went to Europe to pursue a career in Formula Junior and was soon a front-runner, until he ran short of finances and returned to South Africa. In 1963 he started his only World Championship race at East London, driving a three-year-old Cooper-Maserati prepared by Scuderia Lupini, and coming in 12th. He also finished third in the Mozambique Grand Prix in 1963 and 1964.

He continued in the South African Formula One Championship in 1964 and then moved back to Europe and drove in Formula 3, scoring some good results, including a win at Magny-Cours and Nogaro. He returned to South Africa for the 1964 Rand Grand Prix, where he retired his Cooper-Alfa Romeo with engine problems, and he failed to qualify for the 1965 South African Grand Prix.

Later in 1965 he continued in European Formula 3, and suffered serious pelvic and leg injuries in a crash at Albi which ended his season. On his return in 1966, he finished sixth at Rouen-Les-Essarts, and continued to race in Europe in F3 until 1969, before returning permanently to compete in South Africa. On his retirement he became a farmer, but died following a heart attack aged 59.

<text>Vernon John Schuppan (born 19 March 1943) is an Australian former motor racing driver. Schuppan drove in various categories, participating in Formula One, the Indianapolis 500 and most successfully in sports car racing.

Although he considers himself to be a single-seater driver, Schuppan&#x27;s biggest career victory was with the factory-backed Rothmans Porsche team when he partnered Americans Hurley Haywood and Al Holbert to win the 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans driving the Porsche 956.

In 1984 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia for &quot;service to the sport of motor racing&quot;.

==Early career and Formula One==
After a successful karting career in which he won numerous Australian state and national titles, Schuppan made the decision to pursue a career in motor racing. He and his wife Jennifer ventured to Great Britain (with a self-imposed 2-year limit of making it big) to allow him to participate in the British Formula Atlantic Championship, which he won, leading to a test with BRM. As BRM&#x27;s test driver he qualified for the 1972 Belgian Grand Prix at Nivelles-Baulers, but he did not start the race because teammate Helmut Marko commandeered his car, though he did compete in some non-championship races with BRM.

In 1974 Schuppan went to Team Ensign, débuting again in the Belgian Grand Prix where he finished in 15th position. In Monaco he retired on lap four because of an accident. Schuppan was disqualified in both Sweden and the Netherlands; in Sweden because he started illegally from 26th place on the grid and in the Netherlands for receiving a tyre change outside of the pits. Schuppan failed to qualify in France or Britain. He retired in Germany on lap four because of gearbox problems.

In 1975 he raced in one race in Sweden for Embassy Racing With Graham Hill team, retiring from the race with transmission problems. In 1977 Schuppan raced for Surtees, finishing 12th in Britain and a career best seventh in Germany. He finished 16th in Austria, but failed to qualify for his final Formula One race in the Netherlands. Schuppan would later describe Surtees team boss, World Champion John Surtees, as an autocratic owner who &quot;always knew best and wouldn&#x27;t listen to his drivers&quot; and believes his time with the team was hampered by not being given equal equipment to his teammate Vittorio Brambilla.

==Sports cars==
Schuppan has had a very successful sports car career, winning the 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans for Porsche&#x27;s official factory team with Al Holbert and Hurley Haywood in a Rothmans Porsche 956 (#3). Holbert drove the final lap of the race with an overheating (and steaming) engine caused by an airflow blockage to the radiator that cooled the heads, it seized as he crossed the finish line. The second placed car, the #1 Rothmans Porsche of defending winners Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell (driving) was only 17 seconds behind their teammates at the end of 24 hours of racing.

By winning Le Mans in 1983, Schuppan became only the second Australian to win the French classic, following in the footsteps of 1928 winner Bernard Rubin. Although Rubin was born in Australia, Schuppan is often mistaken for being the first Aussie winner.

Schuppan also finished second at Le Mans in 1977 driving a Mirage GR8-Renault turbo with French F1 driver Jean-Pierre Jarier, and second in 1982 in a Rothmans Porsche 956 with Jochen Mass. He also finished third in 1975 with Jean-Pierre Jaussaud in a Mirage GR8-Ford Cosworth DFV.

After winning at Le Mans, Schuppan went on to win the 1983 Japanese Sports-Prototype Championship.

He finished sixth at the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans driving with Jarier and fellow Australian, World Champion Alan Jones making his Le Mans début (and indeed his only start), in a Kremer Racing Porsche 956B after the factory backed Rothmans team boycotted the event over the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest&#x27;s new fuel restriction rules. Initially Porsche were not going to release their drivers for the race, but finally relented less than two weeks before the race and Manfred and Erwin Kremer were more than happy for the defending race winner to join them. Schuppan and Jones fought for the lead in the first few hours of the race with the Lancia LC2 of Bob Wollek and Alessandro Nannini, until the nose of the 956 was damaged by a spinning Roger Dorchy at Mulsanne Corner, losing the team a few laps in repairs. The Kenwood sponsored 956 fought back to be again fighting for the lead, and near the end of the race Jarier was 2 laps down but catching the leading Joest Racing Porsche driven by Klaus Ludwig and Henri Pescarolo (the eventual winners) by over 10 seconds per lap. He then pitted for Schuppan to run the car to the flag. Schuppan got in only one and a half laps before the car broke a conrod with just 90 minutes left to run. As Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest rules state that for a car to be classified as a finisher it must finish the last lap within a certain time, Schuppan fired up the Porsche and headed out for one last lap and a 6th-place finish.

He had a number of other podium finishes in the World Sports Car Championship, including second in the 1973 and 1982 Spa 1000 km, third in the 1983 and 1984 Fuji 1000 km and third in the 1985 Selangor 800 km race. Schuppan also placed third in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship in 1984, 1985 and 1986.

==Other categories==
Schuppan competed in three Indianapolis 500 races. These were 1976 (where he won the Rookie of the Year award), 1979 and 1981, with a best result of third in 1981 driving a McLaren-Ford. In all, he started 32 CART and USAC Championship races. He won the 1974 and 1976 Macau Grand Prix races, dominating the 1974 race, winning by four laps.

He also won the 1971 British Formula Atlantic Championship and the Singapore Grand Prix in 1973. He was second in 1972 and also second in the Malaysian Grand Prix in 1972. He raced Formula 5000 in Europe between 1974 and 1975 and in North America 1974-1976 with some success.

In his home country Australia, Schuppan won the 1976 Rothmans International Series run for Formula 5000 cars, driving a Lola T332-Chevrolet. He placed second in the 1976 Australian Grand Prix at Sandown Park in Melbourne driving an Elfin MR8 Chevrolet, only half a second behind winner John Goss in a Matich A53-Repco Holden. He was also runner up in the 1978 Rothmans International Series, driving an Elfin MR8-Chevrolet for fellow South Australian Garrie Cooper, the owner and founder of Elfin Sports Cars and his factory run Ansett Team Elfin.

When Schuppan was regularly returning home to Australia to race he was also a popular choice as a co-driver for top touring car teams such as Allan Moffat Racing, Dick Johnson Racing and the Peter Brock run Holden Dealer Team in the Sandown 400 and Bathurst 1000 races in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His best finish at Bathurst was a fifth place with Dick Johnson in 1978 driving a Ford XC Falcon. He drove for the Holden Dealer Team in 1981, partnering John Harvey in a Holden VC Commodore to 4th place in the Hang Ten 400 after starting the race, but never got to drive the car at Bathurst after a broken front wheel sent Harvey into the guardrail and retirement on lap 37.

Allan Moffat and Schuppan started on pole and were leading the 1976 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 when their XB Falcon GT Hardtop retired with engine failure in lap 87. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Australian Muscle Car&quot; magazine Schuppan told that Moffat&#x27;s Falcon was the best touring car he ever drove.

==Other activities==

With Japanese backing, Schuppan produced minimally modified street legal 962 race cars. The first, known as the 962R and registered in the UK as H726 LDP, retained the original bodywork and honeycomb chassis from its racing career. Later a road going evolution of the Porsche 962 called the Schuppan 962CR was developed, using different bodywork than the 962R. At the then price of 195 million yen (US$1.5 million) only six were built.

Failure of payment for two of the cars shipped to Japan coupled with the high cost of the car&#x27;s construction and worldwide economic recession, forced Schuppan to declare bankruptcy. Schuppan then also co-owned an Indy Lights team with Stefan Johansson, the pair managed the career of New Zealand born driver Scott Dixon until Schuppan and Johansson had a falling out resulting in Schuppan leaving the partnership.

In May 2006, Schuppan was elected into the Club International des Anciens Pilotes de Grand Prix F1, an eminent organisation based in Monaco.

Schuppan also played an important role in bringing Formula One to the city of Adelaide in his home state of South Australia. F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had originally favoured the Australian Grand Prix to be held in Sydney. However, the Premier of South Australia, John Bannon, asked Schuppan (who knew Ecclestone personally) to come and take a look at Adelaide. Ultimately Ecclestone was so impressed the Grand Prix was held in Adelaide for eleven years from 1985 to 1995.

As of 2014, Schuppan lives in Adelaide with Jennifer, his wife of over 45 years. The couple live in a converted warehouse adjacent to the Adelaide Street Circuit which hosted the Australian Grand Prix and currently hosts the Clipsal 500 on a modified version of the circuit for V8 Supercars. Despite his over 40 years of international motorsport, Schuppan describes living in a city as a new experience. He is also a regular supporter of the Targa Adelaide tarmac rally.

<text>Venatio (, &quot;hunting&quot;, plural &quot;venationes&quot;) was a type of entertainment in Roman amphitheaters involving the hunting and killing of wild animals.

==History==
Venatio was first introduced by Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, who celebrated his Greek campaign by hosting games where gladiators would fight lions and panthers.

Exotic wild beasts from the far reaches of the Roman Empire were brought to Rome and hunts were held in the morning prior to the afternoon main event of gladiatorial duels. The hunts were held in the Roman Forum, the Saepta, and in the Circus Maximus, though none of these venues offered protection to the crowd from the wild animals on display. Special precautions were taken to prevent the animals from escaping these venues, such as the erection of barriers and the digging of ditches. Very few animals survived these hunts though they did sometimes defeat the &quot;bestiarius&quot;, or hunter of wild beast. Thousands of wild animals would be slaughtered in one day. During the Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre (80), about 9,000 animals were killed.
Not all the animals were ferocious, though most were. Animals that appeared in the venatio included lions, elephants, bears, tigers, deer, cows, wolverines, zebras, ostriches, vultures, weasels, polecats, minks, giraffes, eagles, wild goats, parrots, dogs, camels, monkeys, wolves, jackals, foxes, leopards, crocodiles, boars, hippos, and rabbits. Other animals appeared in the venatio included cheetahs, rhinos, gazelles, snakes, horses, hyenas, and gorillas. Some of these animals were trained, and instead of fighting, performed tricks.

The treatment given to wolves differed from the treatment meted out to other large predators. The Romans generally seem to have refrained from intentionally harming wolves. For instance, they were not displayed in the venationes due to their religious importance to the Romans.

Revered for its ferocity, the lion was extremely popular in venationes and gladiatorial shows. Thus the dictator Caesar used 400 lions (imported primarily from North Africa and Syria) in the Circus, where the inclusion of the foreign animal lent his shows extra panache. Indeed, obtaining the animals from the far-flung corners of the empire was an ostentatious display of wealth and power by the emperor or other patron to the populace, and was also meant to demonstrate Roman power of the whole human and animal world and to show the plebs of Rome exotic animals they might never see otherwise.

During the reign of Augustus Caesar the circus games resulted in the death of 3,500 elephants.

==Executions==

Following the venatio in the order of daily events was the execution of convicted Roman citizens of lower status, the &quot;humiliores&quot;. Usual forms of execution included burning at the stake, crucifixion, or &quot;ad bestias&quot; (when the prisoner is left alone in the ring with one or more wild animals).

Roman emperors often sentenced serious criminals — who then became known as &quot;bestiarii&quot; — to fatal encounters with the beasts in the Colosseum — an ancient &quot;death sentence&quot;. These were the lowest social class of participants in the games.

<text>Victor Arthur Wilson (14 April 1931 – 14 January 2001) was a British racing driver.

Born in Hull and raised in South Africa, Wilson participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, the 1960 Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps. In the former, he drove a private Cooper-Climax and retired just before half-distance, while in the latter he was entered in a private BRM but was forced to give his car to American Bob Bondurant before the race. He also participated in some non-Championship Formula One races.

After racing, Wilson worked as a motor dealer before dying in a motor accident at Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="1235711" wikidata="Q220010" url="?curid=1235711" title="Glen Hansard">
<text>Glen James Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician. Since 1990, he has been the frontman of the Irish rock band The Frames, with whom he has released six studio albums, four of which have charted in the top ten of the Irish Album Charts. In the 2000s, he was one half of folk rock duo The Swell Season before releasing his debut solo album, &quot;Rhythm and Repose&quot;, in 2012. His 2015 second album &quot;Didn&#x27;t He Ramble&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album.

Primarily a musician, he has also acted and written music for film; he appeared in the BAFTA-winning film &quot;The Commitments&quot; (1991) and starred in the Irish music drama &quot;Once&quot; (2007) which earned him a number of major awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Falling Slowly&quot; with co-writer and co-star Markéta Irglová. The film was later adapted into a musical theatre production.

==Career==
Hansard quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He formed his own band The Frames in 1990, and the group have been gigging regularly in Ireland since. Hansard came to international attention as guitar player Outspan Foster in the 1991 Alan Parker film &quot;The Commitments&quot;. He has often stated that he regretted taking the role because he felt it distracted him from his music career. In 2003, he presented the television programme &quot;Other Voices: Songs from a Room&quot;, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ.

On 22 April 2006, he released his first album without The Frames, &quot;The Swell Season&quot;, on Overcoat Recordings in collaboration with Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, Marja Tuhkanen from Finland on violin and viola, and Bertrand Galen from France on cello. Hansard also spent part of 2006 in front of the cameras for the music-infused Irish film &quot;Once&quot;, in which Hansard plays a Dublin busker, and Irglová an immigrant street vendor. The film had its United States premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 and received the Festival&#x27;s World Cinema Audience Award.

Hansard had recorded a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Nowhere&quot; for the film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now &quot;good friends&quot;.

Aside from his projects with The Frames and Irglová, Hansard also took part as a member of the band on the 2006 Oxfam charity album, &quot;The Cake Sale&quot;. Hansard has recorded several cover songs, both alone and with band member Colm Mac Con Iomaire, for the Today FM discs &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;. Songs that he has recorded include Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; on &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 1&quot; and Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;Everytime&quot; on &quot;Vol. 2&quot;.

He voiced a role on an episode (&quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot;) on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as an Irish busker. A new album of original songs recorded as The Swell Season with Markéta Irglová and entitled &quot;Strict Joy&quot; was released on 27 October 2009 on the ANTI- record label.

In the summer of 2011, he joined Eddie Vedder on his American solo tour in support of Vedder&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Ukulele Songs&quot;. He played a solo concert at the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Guitar Heroes exhibit in New York City in May 2011 and on Cape Cod at the Cape Cinema on 17 June.

In September 2011, he played at Pearl Jam&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Festival PJ20 at the Alpine Valley Theatre outside of East Troy, Wisconsin. Hansard plays several guitars, including a very recognisable battered Takamine NP15 acoustic guitar (even sporting a large hole), which he calls &quot;The Horse&quot;.

In a November 2011 interview in The Huffington Post with Irglova, it was revealed that Hansard was preparing a solo album and that there was a very possible third release from The Swell Season. This solo album was later revealed to be titled &quot;Rhythm and Repose&quot;.

&quot;American Songwriter&quot; included Hansard&#x27;s &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Leave Me Waiting&quot; on its The Muse July Sampler. Another song of his featured in a film soundtrack is &quot;This Gift&quot;, which appears in &quot;The Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot;.

Hansard sang the song &quot;Take the Heartland&quot; on the soundtrack for the 2012 film &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. Another song he wrote, &quot;Come Away to the Water&quot;, is featured on the soundtrack, but is covered by Maroon 5 and Rozzi Crane. Hansard can be found singing &quot;Come Away to the Water&quot; on the deluxe edition of his first solo album &quot;Rhythm and Repose&quot;. He guest-starred in an episode of the TV series, &quot;Parenthood&quot;, playing himself. In the episode, &quot;Trouble in Candyland&quot;, he performed &quot;High Hope&quot;, a single from his solo debut album &quot;Rhythm and Repose&quot;. In 2015, Hansard and Lisa Hannigan recorded a song, &quot;On Love&quot;, for the soundtrack for the 2014 film &quot;Kahlil Gibran&#x27;s The Prophet&quot;. Hansard sang Coyote at the Joni Mitchell 75th birthday concert Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration in Los Angeles in December 2018.

In 2022, he toured with Eddie Vedder. In October he recorded &quot;Take Heart&quot;, featuring Marketa Irglova, Bono and Ukrainian refugees in response to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.

In December 2023, Hansard performed a rendition of &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; alongside Lisa O&#x27;Neill backed by The Pogues at Shane MacGowan&#x27;s funeral service held in St Mary&#x27;s of the Rosary Catholic Church, Nenagh, Co Tipperary, Ireland. They sang the roles of the 1987 original hit recording by MacGowan and the late Kirsty MacColl.

==Influences==
Hansard has remarked about his musical influences: &quot;In my house, when I was a kid, there was the holy trinity, which was Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison, and Bob Dylan with Bob sitting centre.&quot; Hansard and The Frames toured as the support act for Bob Dylan in Australia and New Zealand in August 2007 and Hansard often performs Van Morrison&#x27;s songs in concert. Two such songs include &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, and &quot;And the Healing Has Begun&quot; which were included on the collector&#x27;s edition of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Once&quot;.

Hansard is a devotee of Krishna and performed for the 80th birthday of Swami Prabhupada in London, staying at a manor donated to the Hare Krishna movement by The Beatles&#x27; George Harrison, who was a Hare Krishna devotee. In July 2013, he sang with Bruce Springsteen at Nowlan Park, Kilkenny, Ireland. In July 2015, he performed &quot;Raglan Road&quot; with Ed Sheeran in Croke Park, Dublin.

==Personal life==
During the promotional tour for &quot;Once&quot;, Hansard and Irglová began dating. Said Hansard about his relationship with Irglova: &quot;I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she&#x27;s just a kid&quot;. The relationship ended after two years.

In 2008, Hansard took a four-week filmmaking workshop at the New York Film Academy.

Hansard used to live at 21 Bleecker Street in Noho, New York City.

In 2016, Hansard was a member of the Home Sweet Home Group, a coalition of activists and homeless people. The group broke into Apollo House in Dublin and illegally occupied it. They eventually had to vacate the premises due to a High Court ruling.

His partner, poet Maire Saaritsa, gave birth to their first child, a boy named Christy, in October 2022. Hansard and Saaritsa planned to marry at the end of 2022. The couple reside in both Ireland and Helsinki.

<text>The United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines are rules published by the U.S. Sentencing Commission that set out a uniform policy for sentencing individuals and organizations convicted of felonies and serious (Class A) misdemeanors in the United States federal courts system. The Guidelines do not apply to less serious misdemeanors or infractions.

Although the Guidelines were initially styled as mandatory, the US Supreme Court&#x27;s 2005 decision in &quot;United States v. Booker&quot; held that the Guidelines, as originally constituted, violated the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, and the remedy chosen was to excise those provisions of the law establishing the Guidelines as mandatory. After &quot;Booker&quot; and other Supreme Court cases, such as &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot; (2004), the Guidelines are now considered advisory only. Federal judges (state judges are not affected by the Guidelines) must calculate the guidelines and consider them when determining a sentence, but are not required to issue sentences within the guidelines.

==History==

===Enabling legislation===
The Guidelines are the product of the United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Guidelines&#x27; primary goal was to alleviate sentencing disparities that research had indicated were prevalent in the existing sentencing system, and the guidelines reform was specifically intended to provide for determinate sentencing. This refers to sentencing whose actual limits are determined at the time the sentence is imposed, as opposed to indeterminate sentencing, in which a sentence with a maximum (and, perhaps, a minimum) is pronounced but the actual amount of time served in prison is determined by a parole commission or similar administrative body after the person has started serving his or her sentence. As part of the guidelines reform in 1984, parole on federal level was abolished.

The federal effort followed guidelines projects in several states, initially funded by the United States Department of Justice, and led by Jack Kress and his research team during the late 1970s. The first sentencing guidelines jurisdictions were county-wide, in Denver, Newark, Chicago and Philadelphia. Statewide guidelines systems were next established in Utah, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, Washington, and Delaware, before the federal sentencing guidelines were formally adopted in 1987. Given that the vast majority of criminal sentencing is done at the state level, the American Law Institute and the American Bar Association have each recommended such systems for all the states, and nearly half the states presently have such systems, although significant variations exist among them. For example, Minnesota&#x27;s Sentencing Guidelines Commission initially sought consciously not to increase prison capacity through guidelines. That is, Minnesota assumed that the legislature should determine how much would be spent on prisons and that the sentencing commission&#x27;s job was to allocate those prison beds in as rational a way as possible. The federal effort took the opposite approach. It determined how many prisons would be needed and Congress was then essentially required to fund those beds.

===Promulgation and modification===
In drafting the first set of guidelines, the Commission used data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission&#x27;s guidelines and statistics, and data from other sources in order to determine which distinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. Sentencing criteria already in use by judges was thus codified as guidelines. The Commission essentially codified existing practice. Future modifications often reflected Congressional mandates, as in the case of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences.

In 2003, Congress considered the Feeney Amendment to the PROTECT Act. This amendment would have totally rewritten the guidelines. Among other changes, the original amendment would have eliminated all unenumerated downward departures and all downward departures for family ties, diminished capacity, aberrant behavior, educational or vocational skills, mental or emotional conditions, employment record, good works, or overstated criminal history. Defense lawyers, law professors, current and former Sentencing Commissioners, the President of the American Bar Association, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and others wrote to Congress opposing the amendment. The enacted bill limited the changes described above to crimes involving pornography, sexual abuse, child sex, and child kidnapping and trafficking. It also raised penalties for child pornography and child sex abuse. It also greatly increased prosecutorial discretion and influence by limiting judges&#x27; power to depart from the guidelines and granting prosecutors greater power over departures. For instance, it made a prosecutorial motion a prerequisite for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. It also instructed the Sentencing Commission to authorize four-level &quot;fast-track&quot; downward departures in illegal-reentry immigration cases upon motion of the prosecutor.

===&quot;United States v. Booker&quot;===
Though the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were styled as mandatory, the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2005 decision in &quot;United States v. Booker&quot; found that the Guidelines, as originally constituted, violated the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, and the chosen remedy was excision of those provisions of the law establishing the Guidelines as mandatory. In the aftermath of &quot;Booker&quot; and other Supreme Court cases, such as &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot; (2004), Guidelines are now considered advisory only. Federal judges (state judges are not affected by the Guidelines) must calculate the guidelines and consider them when determining a sentence but are not required to issue sentences within the guidelines. Those sentences are still, however, subject to appellate review. The frequency in which sentences are imposed that exceed the range stated in the Guidelines has doubled in the years since the &quot;Booker&quot; decision.

== Guidelines basics ==

The Guidelines determine sentences based primarily on two factors:
# the conduct associated with the offense (the offense conduct, which produces the offense level)
# the defendant&#x27;s criminal history (the criminal history category)
The Sentencing Table in the Guidelines Manual shows the relationship between these two factors; for each pairing of offense level and criminal history category, the Table specifies a sentencing range, in months, within which the court may sentence a defendant. For example, for a defendant convicted on an offense with a total offense level of 22 and a criminal history category of I, the Guidelines recommend a sentence of 41–51 months. If, however, a person with an extensive criminal history (Category VI) committed the same offense in the same manner in the same modern timeline and not during the older guideline periods, the Guidelines would recommend a sentence of 84–105 months.

===Offense level===
There are 43 offense levels. The offense level of a defendant is determined by looking up the offense in Chapter 2 and applying any applicable adjustments. The originally proposed sentencing guidelines had 360 levels, and there are proposals to substantially reduce the current number of offense levels.

===Criminal history===
There are six criminal history categories. Each category is associated with a range of criminal history points. Thus, for example, a defendant with 0 or 1 criminal history points would be in Criminal History Category I, while a defendant with 13 or more criminal history points would be in Criminal History Category VI. The criminal history points are calculated by adding 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month; adding 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days but not more than 13 months; adding 1 point for each prior sentence of less than sixty days; adding 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status; adding 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence of sixty days or more or while in imprisonment or escape status on such a sentence, except that if 2 points are added committing the offense while under a criminal justice sentence, adding only 1 point for this item; and adding 1 point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence that did not receive any points because such sentence was counted as a single sentence, up to a total of 3 points for this item.

The guidelines require &quot;counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court.&quot; This reflects a policy that defendants who previously received the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and then commit further crimes should not be treated with further leniency.

===Zones===
There are four sentencing zones: A, B, C, and D. Zone A consists of sentencing ranges of 0–6 months. Zone B consists of sentencing ranges above Zone A but with a maximum penalty of no more than 15 months. Zone C consists of sentencing ranges above Zone B but whose maximum penalty is 18 months or less. Zone D consists of sentencing ranges above Zone C.

A defendant in Zone A is eligible for Federal Probation, and no term of imprisonment is required. Probation is also authorized if the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table and the court imposes a condition or combination of conditions requiring intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention as provided in , but at least one month of the sentence must be satisfied by imprisonment. A split sentence is authorized for defendants in Zone C. That is, Zone C defendants must serve at least half of their sentence in prison.

In 2010, the U.S. Sentencing Commission proposed expanding Zones B and C, in recognition of the fact that many offenders are sentenced to 12 months and 1 day in order to receive the benefit of good time under U.S. federal law.

==Adjustments==

===Reductions in time to be served===
A 2- or 3-level offense level decrease is typically granted for acceptance of responsibility if the defendant accepts a plea bargain. However, the decrease will not apply if the defendant demonstrates behavior, such as continued criminal activity, that is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.

===Increase in time to be served===
There are victim-related adjustments for hate crime motivation or vulnerable victims; official victims; restraint of victims; and terrorism. Adjustments can apply depending on the offender&#x27;s role in the offense, which can include an aggravating role, a mitigating role. Enhancements apply for abuse of a position of trust or use of a special skill, using a minor to commit a crime, and use of body armor or a firearm in drug trafficking crimes and crimes of violence.

In addition, there are enhancements related to obstruction of justice, including obstructing or impeding the administration of justice, reckless endangerment during flight, commission of an offense while on release, and false registration of a domain name.

Adjustments also apply in cases involving multiple counts.

==Departures==
Departures upward or downward from the guideline range are appropriate for cases that deviate from the heartland of cases.

Departures are allowed in cases involving substantial assistance to authorities in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense. The Sentencing Reform Act allows a departure below the applicable statutory mandatory minimum in such cases. There is no penalty for refusal to assist authorities.

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and U.S. Sentencing Guidelines require that the prosecution file a motion allowing the reduction. The court is not required to grant the reduction, and may decline to do so if it deems the information provided by the defendant to be untruthful, incomplete, unreliable, insignificant, not useful, or untimely. The Guidelines provide, &quot;Substantial weight should be given to the government&#x27;s evaluation of the extent of the defendant&#x27;s assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.&quot;

Some defendants attempt to provide substantial assistance, but their assistance is ultimately deemed not to be substantial, which prevents them from getting the departure even if they made incriminating statements.

Other grounds for departure:

*Death (§5K2.1)
*Physical injury (§5K2.2)
*Extreme psychological injury (§5K2.3)
*Abduction or unlawful restraint (§5K2.4)
*Property damage or loss (§5K2.5)
*Weapons and dangerous instrumentalities (§5K2.6)
*Disruption of governmental function (§5K2.7)
*Extreme conduct (§5K2.8)
*Criminal purpose (§5K2.9)
*Victim&#x27;s conduct (§5K2.10)
*Lesser harms (§5K2.11)
*Coercion and duress (§5K2.12)
*Diminished capacity (§5K2.13)
*Public welfare (§5K2.14)
*Voluntary disclosure of offense (§5K2.16)
*Semiautomatic firearms capable of accepting large capacity magazines (§5K2.17)
*Violent street gangs (§5K2.18)
*Post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts (§5K2.19)
::Prior to October 2010:

::After &quot;Pepper v. United States&quot; (2011) but before November 1, 2012:

::After November 1, 2012:

*Aberrant behavior (§5K2.20)
*Dismissed and uncharged conduct (§5K2.21)
*Specific offender characteristics as grounds for downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses (§5K2.22)
*Discharged terms of imprisonment (§5K2.23)
*Commission of offense while wearing or displaying unauthorized or counterfeit insignia or uniform (§5K2.24)
==Controversies==
Among the controversial aspects of the Sentencing Guidelines have been the 100:1 disparity between treatment of crack and cocaine (which has been amended to 18:1 by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010) and the immigration guidelines which call for hefty enhancements for illegal re-entrants with prior felony records, despite the prior offenses already being taken into account via the Criminal History Category. Heavy penalties for child pornography offenders have also come under fire. Many judges are refusing to apply the Guidelines in these cases.

It has been argued that the Sentencing Guidelines actually increase unwarranted sentencing disparities. Joseph S. Hall writes, &quot;Factors such as whether or not the defendant can afford a skilled attorney capable of making innovative legal arguments or performing detailed factual investigations have a profound influence on a defendant&#x27;s sentence. The prosecutor&#x27;s power to extract guilty pleas, previously held in check by judges, is now counterbalanced only by the diligence of the defense attorney.&quot; William J. Stuntz claims that &quot;when necessary, the litigants simply bargain about what facts will (and won&#x27;t) form the basis for sentencing. It seems to be an iron rule: guidelines sentencing empowers prosecutors, even where the guidelines&#x27; authors try to fight that tendency ... In short, plea bargains outside the law&#x27;s shadow depend on prosecutors&#x27; ability to make credible threats of severe post-trial sentences. Sentencing guidelines make it easy to issue those threats.&quot;

The federal guilty plea rate has risen from 83% in 1983 to 96% in 2009, a rise attributed largely to the Sentencing Guidelines.

==Sentencing table==
The sentencing table is an integral part of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.

The Offense Level (1–43) forms the vertical axis of the Sentencing Table. The Criminal History Category (I–VI) forms the horizontal axis of the Table. The intersection of the Offense Level and Criminal History Category displays the Guideline Range in months of imprisonment. &quot;Life&quot; means life imprisonment. For example, the guideline range applicable to a defendant with an Offense Level of 15 and a Criminal History Category of III is 24–30 months of imprisonment. If all counts that carry the maximum sentence of 5–40 years total the level to 43 and above, then a life sentence is restricted. For a defendant under the Juvenile Delinquency Act, the sentence is 50 years for Levels 43 and up.

==Fines==
For individuals, the fine table is as follows:

The Guidelines state that the court can impose a fine above the maximum set out in the table if the defendant is convicted under a statute authorizing a maximum fine greater than $250,000, or a fine for each day of violation. The court can waive the fine if the defendant is unlikely to be able to pay or if the fine would unduly burden the defendant&#x27;s dependents; however, the Guidelines state that the court must still impose a total combined sanction that is punitive.

==Probation and supervised release==
The Guidelines state that the term of probation shall be at least one year but not more than five years if the offense level is 6 or greater, and no more than three years in any other case. The Guidelines provide that the term of supervised release under U.S. federal law shall be at least three years but not more than five years for a defendant convicted of a Class A or B felony; at least two years but not more than three years for a defendant convicted of a Class C or D felony; and one year for a defendant convicted of a Class E felony or a Class A misdemeanor. However, a life term of supervised release may be imposed for any offense listed in , the commission of which resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person; or a sex offense. Supervised release is recommended by the Guidelines for most offenders who are serving a prison sentence of more than a year.

<text>Pinhal Novo () is a town in Portugal situated in the Setúbal Peninsula halfway between Lisbon and Setúbal. It is a civil parish of the Palmela Municipality. The population in 2011 was 25,000, in an area of 54.44 km2. It is served by two highways connecting Lisbon to the South and by its new train station that has enabled residents to connect directly to Lisbon&#x27;s subway network in 38 minutes since October 2004. It is located near the Arrabida Natural Park and many of facilities, such as shopping centres including Forum Montijo, the Alcochete Freeport, Pinô Shopping Centre and Mochos, two of the most popular Portuguese shopping companies.

The city is experiencing continuous growth and has expanded from a little village a few years ago to a planned 40, 000 resident city. It benefits from new infrastructure, and urbanisation plans do not allow large buildings, which contributes to a certain quality of life.

<text>Heslington Church is in the parish (and village) of Heslington, near York, England. As well as the village and some more modern housing estates, the church also serves some outlying farms. The Heslington campus of the University of York is also in the parish.

It is a local ecumenical partnership between the Church of England and the Methodist Church, making it one of few joint Methodist/Anglican churches. It was formed from Saint Paul&#x27;s Church, Heslington and Heslington Methodist Chapel in 1971, the name of the combined church being &quot;Heslington Church&quot;, though some people still incorrectly refer to it as &quot;St Paul&#x27;s&quot;. The old Methodist Chapel is now the village meeting room.

==History==
The earliest record of the parish of Heslington is in 1299; it was from that time until 1842 subject to the peculiar jurisdiction of the Prebend of Ampleforth. The advowson passed to the Archbishop of York in 1842.

Originally constructed in 1858, the building still looks like a Victorian parish church from the south. It was extended in the 1970s by the ecclesiastical architect Ronald Sims; he removed the old north wall, and added a modern suite of meeting rooms, including a vestry and kitchen, on the north side. The old choir and sanctuary now form a separate chapel, and the congregation sits in a semicircle facing the new altar to the north. Sims&#x27;s design makes use of exposed breeze blocks and concrete lintels which are not to everyone&#x27;s taste. The building is now a Grade II listed building.

Each denomination in the ecumenical partnership is represented by a member of clergy; the Anglican vicar was Rev. Adam Romanis, also vicar of St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church on Lawrence Street, from 2020 until his retirement in August 2024. The Rev&#x27;d Dr. John Schofield, Methodist chaplain to the University of York, represents the Methodist Church. Services are conducted from a combined liturgy, written by the church.

==Services and meetings==
Sunday services take place at 10.00am. Aside from the usual midweek meetings, the church also plays host to various university groups throughout the week.

<doc id="1235724" wikidata="Q6922291" url="?curid=1235724" title="Mount Morris Dam">
<text>The Mount Morris Dam is a concrete gravity dry dam on the Genesee River. It is located at the northern end of Letchworth State Park, south of Rochester, New York in the towns of Leicester and Mount Morris in Livingston County, New York. It is the largest dam of its type east of the Mississippi River and its purpose is to mitigate downstream flooding between Mount Morris and Lake Ontario.

==History==
The Mt. Morris Dam was built between 1948 and 1952 by the Buffalo District office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The project was authorized by the United States Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1944 at a cost of $25 million.

Prior to the construction of the dam, the Genesee River Valley and the city of Rochester had experienced periodic flooding. The flood of 1865, which developed flows exceeding per minute, resulted in massive destructions with flows equating to half the flows of Niagara Falls. Severe floods occurred every seven years on average between 1865 and 1950. Prior projects in Rochester, including retaining walls and a deepening of the river, were insufficient to stop a major flood event.

The USACE states that, in the years since the completion of the dam, an estimated $1 billion in flooding damages have been prevented. In June 1972, Hurricane Agnes passed over the Genesee Valley, causing over 7 inches of rain to fall across the entire valley in a short period of time. The water inflow due to Hurricane Agnes exceeded the storage capacity of the reservoir and it was necessary to release water through the gates of the dam, causing minor downstream flooding. These releases were made to prevent overtopping of the spillway. Had the spillway overtopped, accumulated debris in the reservoir would have passed downstream, causing log jams and additional damage. Inflows of this magnitude are only expected to happen an average of every 300 years. An estimated $210 million in damages was prevented by the dam during the storm.

==Commemorations==
June 2002 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the completion of Mount Morris Dam. A celebration and dedication of the commemorative kiosk was held to honor and recognize the men and women employed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District and Mount Morris Dam Builders, 1948–1952. The kiosk rests on a foundation of bricks, each of which is inscribed with the name and occupation of the builders.

==Visiting Centers==
The William B. Hoyt II Visitor Center at Mount Morris Dam, opened by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1999, was built to accommodate the thousands of people who visit the dam each year. This center features a large atrium, museum, theater and public restroom facilities.

<doc id="1235730" wikidata="Q5164205" url="?curid=1235730" title="Constitution of Maryland">
<text>The current Constitution of the State of Maryland, which was ratified by the people of the state on September 18, 1867, forms the basic law for the U.S. state of Maryland. It replaced the short-lived Maryland Constitution of 1864 and is the fourth constitution under which the state has been governed. It was last amended in 2024.

At approximately 47,000 words (including annotations), the Maryland Constitution is much longer than the average length of a state constitution in the United States, which is about 26,000 words (the United States Constitution is about 8,700 words long).

==Background, drafting, and ratification==
Maryland had constitutional conventions in 1776 and 1850–51. The state&#x27;s 1864 constitution was written in a convention during the Civil War, while the Unionists temporarily controlled Maryland. Approved by a bare majority (50.31%) of the state&#x27;s eligible voters, including Maryland men who were serving in the Union army outside the state, it temporarily disfranchised the approximately 25,000 men in Maryland who had fought for the Confederacy or in other ways supported it, in an effort to bring change to the state. Also, while the state&#x27;s remaining slaves were emancipated by constitutional amendment, the 1864 constitution changed the basis of representation in the General Assembly to help keep power in the hands of the white elite.
The Constitution of 1867 was drafted by a convention which met at the state capital, Annapolis, between May 8 and August 17, 1867. It was submitted to the adult white male citizens of the state for ratification on September 18 and was approved by a vote of 47,152 to 23,036. It took effect on October 5, 1867.
Maryland held a constitutional convention in 1967-68.

==Specific Provisions==
===Declaration of Rights===
The Maryland Constitution begins with a Declaration of Rights, which is similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights but, like most state bills of rights, is broader than the federal version. Among other things, the Maryland Constitution guarantees trial by jury, due process, freedom of the press, and of religion. It also forbids, among other things, the passage of ex post facto laws and cruel and unusual punishment. Notably, juries in criminal cases are declared to be judges of law as well as fact, thus ensconcing in the constitution the right of (what is commonly called) jury nullification—commonplace in the early 19th century. By 1867 this principle was already in decline as a result of abuse (in such conflicts as the Mormons in Nauvoo, Illinois and the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850), and today very much the minority position. The right of the jury to be judge of the law has since been declared unconstitutional, at least with respect to matters implicating federal constitutional rights, by the Supreme Court of Maryland in Unger vs. Maryland (2012).

While the Declaration of Rights does say that &quot;a well regulated Militia is the proper and natural defence of a free Government,&quot; it does not guarantee a right to bear arms. The Maryland Constitution is one of the few state constitutions that lacks the equivalent of the federal Second Amendment.

Reflecting Maryland&#x27;s history of religious toleration, it limits the guarantee against religious disabilities to those who believe in God and divine rewards and punishments. Article 36 includes the wording:
nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come.

A unanimous 1961 decision by US Supreme court in the case of &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot; found that an attempt to enforce this provision violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In 1970, this article was amended to include the sentence &quot;Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion&quot;. The original wording of the article was left in place, presumably as symbolic rather than effective.

Maryland&#x27;s Constitution describes the separation of powers doctrine, which is implied in the federal constitution. The Maryland Constitution states that &quot;the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.&quot;

===Elective Franchise===
Article I defines the requirements for holding elections, the qualifications to be allowed to vote, and penalties for voter misconduct (such as intentionally voting in a district one does not reside in, or voting more than once in an election).

===Executive Department===
Article II creates the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, establishes the qualifications for candidates, the rules for counting ballots, deciding who shall become governor or Lieutenant governor in the event of a tie, impeachment for misconduct, and the process for replacement if the office becomes vacant temporarily or permanently due to death, resignation, disability or impeachment.

===Legislative Department===
Article III creates the Legislature, styled the General Assembly, separated into two houses, a Senate and House of Delegates, defines the qualification and number of members of each house, the means of election and provisions for removal from office for misconduct, and process for replacement of members whose office becomes vacant.

===Judicial Department===
Article IV creates the Supreme Court of Maryland and various lower courts, sets the requirement for judges, length of tenure, and removal from office. It also provides for a Sheriff to be elected for each county.

===Attorney General and State&#x27;s Attorney===
Article V creates the office of the Attorney General and a State&#x27;s Attorney in each county, provides for their election, qualifications for candidates, procedure for impeachment and replacement in the event the office becomes vacant.

===Treasury Department===
Article VI creates a Treasury Department and establishes the procedure for appointment of a Comptroller and a Treasurer, as well as their duties, procedure for removal for misconduct and replacement if the office becomes vacant.

===Sundry Officers===
Article VII provides for the election of County Commissioners.

===Education===
Article VIII requires the legislature to establish a set of Free Public Schools, and to support them &quot;by taxation or other means.&quot;

===Militia and Military Affairs===
Article IX provides for the creation of a Militia and for the appointment of an Adjutant General by the Governor to manage the Militia.

===City of Baltimore===
Article XI creates the City of Baltimore and deems it an independent city, and provides it with a mayor and a two-part City Council with a maximum 90 day period of operation, and provides for several additional sub-articles within article XI regarding the operation of the City.

==Amendments==

===Amendment process===
Amendments to the constitution are proposed by the state legislature with a three-fifths vote in both chambers. Amendments must then be ratified by a simple majority of the people voting on the question in a referendum held simultaneously with the next general election. Unlike the federal constitution, when the Maryland Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force. However, most printed versions of the constitution include annotations which indicate which portions were amended or removed and at what times.

A provision in the document requires that every 20 years the people of the state be asked if a state constitutional convention should be convened. Such a convention is called if a majority of the voters request it. At the latest election where this question could be asked in 2010, the voters did not choose to call a convention.

===Notable amendments===
While the average state constitution has been amended approximately 115 times, , the Maryland Constitution has been amended almost 200 times, most recently in 2024. In 1910, the Digges Amendment was proposed, to increase property requirements for voter registration. It would have effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites (including recent European immigrants), as had been accomplished by other states through various means, beginning with Mississippi&#x27;s new constitution of 1890. Other Maryland laws had already reduced black voter rolls, but this amendment was rejected by voters at the general election.

In 1970, voters approved an amendment that created the office of the Lieutenant Governor of Maryland. In 1972, an amendment that created the current legislative district system of the Maryland General Assembly was approved.

===2008 amendments===
In 2008, two amendments were proposed on the 2008 U.S. presidential election ballot for the state of Maryland. The first amendment proposed to allow early voting in state and allow qualified voters to vote at polling places outside of their home district. The amendment was approved with 72.1% of the vote. The second amendment proposed to authorize the state to issue up to five video lottery licenses for the primary purpose of raising revenue for education of children in public schools. The amendment was approved with 58.7% of the vote.

===2012 amendments===
In 2012, three constitutional amendments were proposed on the 2012 U.S. presidential election ballot for the state of Maryland. The first amendment proposed to require judges of the Orphans&#x27; Court for Prince George&#x27;s County to have a Maryland state law license and to be a current member of the Maryland Bar Association. The amendment was approved with 87.8% of the vote. The second amendment proposed to require judges of the Orphans&#x27; Court for Baltimore County to have a Maryland state law license and to be a current member of the Maryland Bar. The amendment was approved with 88.1% of the vote. The third amendment proposed to change the point at which an elected official charged with certain crimes is suspended or removed from office. Under the amended law, an elected official would be suspended when found guilty and removed when the conviction becomes final or when pleading guilty or no contest. The amendment was approved with 88% of the vote.

===2024 amendments===
In 2024, Maryland residents overwhelmingly approved a constitutional provision recognising abortion access within the state.

Seidel often entered cars under his own name, or under the Scuderia Colonia banner. After having been refused a start at the 1962 German Grand Prix due to slowness, Seidel got in an argument with officials from the Automobilclub von Deutschland. Combined with some doubts about the level of preparation of his cars, Seidel&#x27;s competition licence was withdrawn, and he offered his two cars up for sale. In spite of not having a licence, Seidel competed in the non-championship 1962 Mexican Grand Prix a few months later.

He died in 1987 of a heart attack.

<text>Virgin Prunes were an Irish post-punk band formed in 1977 in Dublin. They disbanded in 1986 after the departure of singer Gavin Friday. The other members continued under the name the Prunes until they split up in 1991.

==History==
The Virgin Prunes were founded in 1977 by vocalists Guggi (né Derek Rowen), Gavin Friday (né Fionan Hanvey) and Dave-iD Busaras, guitarist Dik Evans (brother of U2&#x27;s The Edge), bassist Strongman (Trevor Rowen, brother of Guggi) and drummer Pod (Anthony Murphy).

Two of the band members, Guggi and Friday, had been part of Lypton Village, a &quot;youthful gang&quot; in early 1970s Dublin, which had also included U2&#x27;s Bono (né Paul Hewson).

Known for their outrageous and controversial stage performances, led by theatrical singer/songwriter Friday, the band began playing small shows in Dublin, gaining them a cult audience. Pod left the group and was replaced by Haa-Lacka Binttii (né Daniel Figgis). With Binttii on drums, tape loops and keyboards, the band secured a deal with Rough Trade Records. They released their first single, &quot;Twenty Tens&quot; on their own Baby Records label (distributed by Rough Trade) on 8 January 1981, followed by a second single, &quot;Moments and Mine (Despite Straight Lines)&quot;, on 27 June 1981.

Two other tracks recorded with Binttii were released during 1981 before conflicts with other members forced him out of the band. &quot;Red Nettle&quot; was included on &quot;NME&quot; compilation &quot;C81&quot; and &quot;Third Secret&quot; appeared on Cherry Red compilation &quot;Perspectives and Distortion&quot;. Work had already started on the &quot;A New Form of Beauty&quot; project while Bintti was with the band, but after he was replaced by Mary D&#x27;Nellon (né David Kelly) on drums, some of his tracks were rerecorded and his name was not included in the credits. He later formed the project Princess Tinymeat.

&quot;A New Form of Beauty&quot; was a project that originally contained four chapters and was released in various formats: a 7&quot; single, 10&quot; single and 12&quot; EP released in 1981, and a cassette issued in 1982. All four parts were later collected as the &quot;A New Form of Beauty Parts 1-4&quot; compilation album. The project also included two additional pieces, the unpublished book &quot;A New Form of Beauty 6&quot; and the unreleased film &quot;A New Form of Beauty 7&quot;.

In November 1982, the Virgin Prunes released their debut studio album, &quot;...If I Die, I Die&quot; (produced by Colin Newman of Wire), as well as the double 10&quot; EP &quot;Hérésie&quot;, a French box set. Commissioned by Yann Farcy after seeing them perform at the Rex Club in Paris, &quot;Hérésie&quot; was based on a loose examination of insanity. In 1984, both Guggi and Dik Evans, unhappy with the music business, left the band. This forced drummer D&#x27;Nellon to switch to guitar and allowed Pod to return as the band&#x27;s drummer. The Virgin Prunes started to record but abandoned the unreleased album &quot;Sons Find Devils&quot;.

A retrospective video titled &quot;Sons Find Devils - A Live Retrospective 1981-1983&quot; was released in 1986 by Ikon; this video had nothing to do with the unreleased album of the same name. In April 1985, rarities compilation &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; was released.

In July 1986, the band, now a four-piece, finally released a second studio album, &quot;The Moon Looked Down and Laughed&quot; (including recordings of music written for &quot;Sons Find Devils&quot;). Later that year, Friday left the group. His departure was confirmed in the liner notes of the band&#x27;s 1987 live album &quot;The Hidden Lie&quot;, which contained a short statement confirming the band&#x27;s breakup.

After disbanding as Virgin Prunes, D&#x27;Nellon, Strongman and Busaras formed an offshoot group called The Prunes, which released three albums between 1988 and 1991 (1988&#x27;s &quot;Lite Fantastik&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Nada&quot;, and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blossoms &amp; Blood&quot; ). Dik Evans played on ”Lite Fantastik&quot; while 17-year-old Justin Kavanagh (aka Valley Limberg) from the Dublin hardcore band Mutant Asylum took the helm as guitarist for &quot;Blossoms &amp; Blood&quot;. In 1993, Kavanagh went on to form Gormenghast and Snifferdog with Ger Griffin. Binttii&#x27;s youngest brother, Jonathan Figgis, was the boy who appeared on the cover of the second Virgin Prunes single, &quot;Moments and Mine&quot;.

In 1998, Cleopatra Records rereleased the &quot;Sons Find Devils&quot; video, along with a soundtrack album on CD. This was the first commercially available Virgin Prunes material to be released since 1993 and, for a few years, the only commercially available full-length Virgin Prunes album on compact disc (though studio recordings of the songs &quot;Baby Turns Blue&quot;, &quot;Pagan Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Caucasian Walk&quot; had cropped up on various goth and post-punk CD compilations).
Friday went on to have a reasonably successful solo career in both music and film, releasing five solo albums and several scores, while Guggi remained an influential artist in Dublin and Busaras continued to record as a solo artist in Ireland. After 20 years of self-imposed seclusion from the rock world, Dik Evans gave an overview of he and his brother The Edge&#x27;s early years in U2 for the December 2005 issue of &quot;Word Magazine&quot;.

Daniel Figgis later became a composer and multimedia producer and curator, becoming composer in residence with Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown, Dublin. One of his compositions, &quot;Post Production&quot;, a 23-section suite for four musicians, was performed at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York City in December 2006. In 2008, the Arts&gt;World financial centre commissioned Figgis to compose and perform the sole European commission to celebrate their 20th anniversary of arts programming. His multi-disciplinary festival, &quot;Snakes &amp; Ladders&quot;, appeared on Broadway on 8 January 2010 at Symphony Space.

The Virgin Prunes discography was remastered and reissued on Mute Records in 2004. The set of reissues included &quot;...If I Die, I Die&quot;, &quot;The Moon Looked Down and Laughed&quot;, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Hérésie&quot; and an album of selections from the &quot;A New Form of Beauty&quot; series. In 2006, Busaras, Guggi and Friday contributed a track to the sea shanty collection &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;, appearing in the track listing as &quot;Three Pruned Men&quot;.

On 4 October 2009, three original members of the band (Friday, Guggi and Dik Evans) performed two classic Virgin Prunes songs, &quot;Sweethome Under White Clouds&quot; and &quot;Caucasian Walk&quot;, at Carnegie Hall as part of &quot;An Evening with Gavin Friday and Friends&quot;, to celebrate Friday&#x27;s 50th birthday. J.G. Thirlwell appeared with them as backing vocalist.

<doc id="1235742" wikidata="Q65915" url="?curid=1235742" title="Hans Herrmann">
<text>Hans Herrmann (born 23 February 1928) is a retired Formula One and sports car racing driver from Stuttgart, Germany.

In F1, he participated in 19 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 2 August 1953. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of 10 championship points.

In sports car racing, he also scored the first overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans for Porsche in 1970, in a Porsche 917.

After the death of Tony Brooks in 2022, Hermann became the last surviving F1 podium finisher from the 1950s.

==Early career==
The racing career of Herrmann, who is a baker by trade, spans from cooperation with pre-war legends like Alfred Neubauer to the beginning of the dominance of Porsche at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He took part in now legendary road races like Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and Carrera Panamericana and is one of the few remaining witnesses of this era. &quot;Hans im Glück&quot; (lucky John) escaped from several spectacular incidents or accidents.

Herrmann had a remarkable Mille Miglia race in 1954, when the gates of a railroad crossing were lowered in the last moment before the fast train to Rome passed. Driving a very low Porsche 550 Spyder, Herrmann decided it was too late for a brake attempt anyway, knocked on the back of the helmet of his navigator Herbert Linge to make him duck, and they barely passed below the gates and before the train, to the surprise of the spectators.

==Mercedes-Benz==
From 1954 to 1955, he was part of the Mercedes-Benz factory team, as a junior driver behind Juan Manuel Fangio, Karl Kling, Hermann Lang and later Stirling Moss. When the Silver Arrows came back for the 1954 French Grand Prix to score a 1–2 win, Herrmann drove the fastest lap but had to retire. A podium finish at the 1954 Swiss Grand Prix was his best result in that year as he had to use older versions of the Mercedes-Benz W196, or the least reliable car.

In the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix his teammates Kling and Moss had to abandon early due to the extremely hot conditions on the southern hemisphere in January. Herrmann was called in to share his car with them for a 4th-place finish, giving one point each. Fangio won with two laps more. 
Hans was quick in the 1955 Mille Miglia with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR, comparably or even faster than Moss, but was less lucky than in 1954, as he had to abandon the race.

A crash in practice for the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix put Herrmann out for the ill-fated 1955 season, even though a comeback in the Targa Florio was intended.

==Various marques==
The next years saw Herrmann racing for many marques, in F1 for Cooper, Maserati and BRM. In Berlin&#x27;s AVUS during the 1959 German Grand Prix the brakes of his BRM failed, he crashed in a spectacular way, being thrown out of the car and sliding along the track with the car somersaulting in the air.

With different versions of the Porsche 718 being used as a sportscar and as a Formula Two car, Herrmann scored some wins for Porsche, mainly both the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring and Targa Florio. When the open wheeled single seater version of the Porsche 718 became eligible for Formula One in 1961 due to the rule changes, the results in F1 were disappointing. Herrmann finished 15th (last) in the 1961 Dutch Grand Prix, which was the first ever F1 World Championship race to have no retirements. He left Porsche at the beginning of the 1962 season feeling that he as a local from Stuttgart was &quot;No Prophet In His Own Land&quot; compared to Californian Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier from Sweden. Gurney scored two F1 wins (one non-championship) with the new Porsche 804, but Porsche retired from F1 anyway at the end of 1962.

==Abarth==
With the small cars of the Italian Abarth marque Herrmann spent 1962 to 1965 driving in minor races and hillclimbing events. He only took outright wins in lesser sports car racing events, such as at AVUS or the 500 km Nürburgring. The Abarths were hard to beat in their classes from 850cc to 1600cc, though. Being the only pro in a small team Hermann learned a lot about testing and developing, which helped him later. However, being dissatisfied with the preparation of his car for the 1965 Schauinsland practice, Hans went home to witness the birth of his son, Dino. At the end of the year he left Abarth for good to return to the manufacturer closer to his home.

==Porsche==

In 1966 he returned to Porsche for a comeback in the World Sportscar Championship, as Porsche started a serious effort there. Following several podium finishes with the still underpowered two liter Porsche 906 and later models, he won the 1968 24 Hours of Daytona in a 907 as well as the Sebring 12 Hours again, now together with Swiss Jo Siffert. The overall win of the 1000km Nürburgring always eluded him, even though Herrmann had taken part in each of these races at the Nürburgring since they were introduced in 1953, and had finished second three times in a row from 1968 to 1970, behind teammates Jo Siffert and/or Vic Elford.

Herrmann missed the win in the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans with a Porsche 908 by only 120 meters , but it was he who finally scored the long-awaited first overall victory at the Le Mans 24 Hours for Porsche in 1970. He was assigned to Porsche Salzburg, the Austria-based factory-backed team owned by the Porsche family, which mainly entered cars painted red and white, the Austrian colors. In heavy rain, he and his teammate Richard Attwood survived with their Porsche 917K #23 as the best of only seven finishers.

==Retirement==
Half jokingly, Herrmann had promised to his wife before the Le Mans race that he would retire in case of a win there. Having witnessed fatal accidents of colleagues too many times, e.g. before the 1969 German Grand Prix when his teammate and neighbor Gerhard Mitter died, the 42-year-old announced his retirement on TV, after having driven the winning car in a parade through Stuttgart from the factory to the town hall. To get out of his contract with Porsche Salzburg, Herrmann had to recommend a replacement driver to Louise Piëch.

Using his contacts, Herrmann built a successful company for automotive supplies. He was kidnapped once in the 1990s and kept in a car trunk for many hours before escaping.

Herrmann has remained engaged in the racing community through his retirement, demonstrating historical cars at events such as the &quot;Solitude-Revival&quot;.

<text>John Maxwell Lineham Love (7 December 1924 – 25 April 2005) was a Rhodesian racing driver. He participated in 10 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 29 December 1962. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of six championship points. He also won the 1962 British Saloon Car Championship, now known as the British Touring Car Championship. All but one of his Formula One entries were in races held within Africa, either as championship or non-championship rounds.

Love was born in Bulawayo. He attended Gifford High School. He started his car racing career in a single-seat Cooper F3 with a Manx Norton 500 cc engine after racing a Triumph Grand Prix motorcycle, which Love then-allowed Jim Redman to ride when starting his race career, in recognition of Redman&#x27;s assistance in preparing and maintaining Love&#x27;s Cooper.

Six times South African Formula One Champion in the 1960s, he had originally shone in the European Formula Junior firmament back in 1961–62 at the wheel of a Cooper-Austin from Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s team. An unfortunate accident at Albi resulted in a very badly broken arm and effectively thwarted his chances of moving into full-time Formula One, but he came close when he was nominated as Phil Hill&#x27;s replacement in the works Cooper team for the 1964 Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

He was a regular contestant in the South African Grand Prix from 1965 to 1972. He was leading the 1967 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami in his 2.7 L Climax-engined Cooper, when a misfire prompted him to make a precautionary stop for extra fuel. He dropped back to finish second behind the works Cooper-Maserati of Pedro Rodríguez.

Love would dominate racing in southern Africa in the 1960s, winning the South African Formula One Championship six times in succession from 1964 to 1969. He would also win his home race, the Rhodesian Grand Prix, six times.

He owned the Jaguar dealership in Bulawayo and had his own stock car racing team in the 1980s. He died in 2005, aged 80, from cancer, in Bulawayo.

<doc id="1235749" wikidata="Q1032349" url="?curid=1235749" title="Crystal ball">
<text>A crystal ball is a crystal or glass ball commonly used in fortune-telling. It is generally associated with the performance of clairvoyance and scrying. Used since Antiquity, crystal balls have had a broad reputation with witchcraft, including modern times with charlatan acts and amusements at circus venues, festivals, etc. Other names for the thing include crystal sphere, orbuculum, scrying ball, shew/show(ing) stone, pondering orb, and more variants by dialect.

==History==

By the fifth century AD, scrying using crystal balls was widespread within the Roman Empire and was condemned by the early Christian Church as heretical (magic had been condemned since the Apostolic Era with e.g. Chapter 2 of the Didache).

The tomb of Childeric I, a fifth-century king of the Franks, contained a 3.8 cm (1½ inch) diameter transparent beryl globe. The object is similar to other globes that were later found in tombs from the Merovingian period in Gaul and the Saxon period in England. Some of these were complete with a frame suggesting an ornamental object. It has been pointed out that these mounts are identical to those of later globes also believed to be used for magic or divination, indicating that these crystal globes may have been used for .

John Dee was a noted British mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I. He devoted much of his life to alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy, of which the use of crystal balls was often included.

Crystal gazing was a popular pastime in the Victorian era, and was claimed to work best when the Sun is at its northernmost declination. Immediately before the appearance of a vision, the ball was said to mist up from within.

The use of crystal balls for divination also has a long history with the Romani people. Fortune tellers, known as &quot;drabardi&quot;, traditionally use crystal balls as well as cards to seek knowledge about future events.

==Art of scrying==

The process of scrying often involves the use of crystals, especially crystal balls, in an attempt to predict the future or otherwise divine hidden information. Crystal ball scrying is commonly used to seek supernatural guidance while making difficult decisions in one&#x27;s life (e.g., matters of love or finances).

When the technique of scrying is used with crystals, or any transparent body, it is known as crystallomancy or crystal gazing.

==In stage magic==
Crystal balls are popular props used in mentalism acts by stage magicians. Such routines, in which the performer answers audience questions by means of various ruses, are known as crystal gazing acts. One of the most famous performers of the 20th century, Claude Alexander, was often billed as &quot;Alexander the Crystal Seer&quot;.

==Optics==
Optically, a crystal ball is a ball lens. For typical materials such as quartz and glass, it forms an image of distant objects slightly beyond the surface of the sphere, on the opposite side. Unlike conventional lenses, the image-forming properties are omnidirectional (independent of the direction being imaged)

This omnidirectional focusing can cause a crystal ball to act as a burning glass when it is brought into full sunlight. The image of the sun formed by a large crystal ball will burn a hand that is holding it, and can ignite dark-coloured flammable material placed near it.

==Famous crystal balls==
A crystal ball was among the grave-goods of the Merovingian King, Childeric I (). The grave-goods were discovered in 1653. In 1831, they were stolen from the royal library in France where they were being kept. Few items were ever recovered. The crystal ball was not among them.

The Sceptre of Scotland has a crystal ball in its finial, honoring the tradition of their use by pagan druids. It was made in Italy in the 15th century, and was a gift to James IV from Pope Alexander VI.

The Penn Museum in Philadelphia displays the third-largest crystal ball as the central object in its Chinese Rotunda. Weighing , the sphere is made of quartz crystal from Burma and was shaped through years of constant rotation in a semi-cylindrical container filled with emery, garnet powder, and water. The ornamental treasure was purportedly made for the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) during the Qing dynasty in the 19th century, but no evidence as to its actual origins exists. The crystal ball and an ancient Egyptian statuette which depicted the god Osiris were stolen in 1988. They were recovered three years later with no damage done to either object.

<text>Elena Viktorovna Baranova (; born 28 January 1972) is a Russian former professional basketball player. She is a former Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) player, where she became the first player from Europe in 1997 WNBA inaugural season, the first All-Star from Russia in 2001 and played for the New York Liberty until the 2005 season.

==Career==
Baranova was born in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. She started playing professional basketball at age 16, was included to the Soviet national team at the age of 17, won European Championship at the age of 19 in 1991, and became the Olympic champion at the age of 20 in 1992.

===WNBA===
Baranova was assigned to the Utah Starzz on 22 January 1997 during the initial player allocation of the 1997 WNBA draft. Her debut game was played on 21 June 1997 in a 61 - 73 loss to the Sacramento Monarchs where she recorded 7 points, 7 rebounds and a tremendous 5 blocks. In her first WNBA season she led the League in blocked shots (2.25 blocks per game) and set the League&#x27;s single-game record for three-point field goals with 7 of 9 on 22 July 1997 at Madison Square Garden, New York. Baranova would miss the playoffs for her first three seasons with the Starzz. The team finished 7 - 21 in 1997, 8 - 22 in 1998 and 15 - 17 in 1999. In her three seasons with the Starzz, Baranova played 77 games (starting in 65 of them) and averaged 10 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.3 assists.

On 15 December 1999 she was traded with Utah&#x27;s second-round pick in the 2000 WNBA draft to the Miami Sol (the pick would become Jameka Jones) in exchange for Kate Starbird and the 8th pick in the 2000 WNBA Draft (which turned into Tamicha Jackson). Due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Baranova would sit out the entire 2000 season.
She would return to play in the 2001 WNBA season, still signed to the Sol, and she was awarded &#x27;The Bud Light Shooting Champion&#x27; trophy as the League&#x27;s top free-throw shooter (with 93.1%). The same 2001 season she was selected to play in WNBA All-Star Game in Orlando to become the only player from Russia to represent her country at the All-Star Weekend, where she set WNBA All-Star Game record for blocked shots (4). Helping the Sol to a 20 - 12 regular season record, Baranova reached the playoffs for the first time in here career, but the Sol unfortunately lost to the New York Liberty in the Semi-Finals.

After also missing the 2002 season, she was taken in the 2003 WNBA Dispersal draft by the New York Liberty on 24 April 2003. She stayed with the Liberty for 3 seasons, averaging 9.6 points and 6.5 rebounds in 100 games for the team. The Liberty made the playoffs in 2004 and 2005 and lost in the Eastern Conference Finals and Semi-Finals respectively. 

Also known as &#x27;Russian Queen&#x27; and &#x27;SuperNova&#x27;, Baranova is one of just 2 players in WNBA All-Time History to record over 200 three-point field goals (with 236) and 300 blocks (with 320). 
Although she performed just in 7 seasons, she is 7th in blocks (320), 7th in blocks per game (1.53), 12th in 3-point field goal percentage (39.1%), 14th in rebounds per game (6.4), 17th in free-throw percentage (84.5%).

Baranova&#x27;s final WNBA game ever was Game 2 of the 2005 Eastern Conference First Round on 1 September 2005. Baranova had a very disappointing game, playing 27 minutes and recording 2 points on 1 - 5 FGs shooting (20% FG) and committed 3 fouls. The Liberty would lose 50 - 58 to the Indiana Fever and be eliminated from the playoffs.

===International ===
Baranova&#x27;s scoring and rebounding ability helped the Soviet national team to win gold medals at the 1991 European Championship and 1992 Olympics. She has played in 105 games for her National team (which is Russia all-time record for men and women), in which she scored over 1300 points representing her country at three Olympic Games (1992, 1996, 2004), two World championships (&quot;1998, 2002&quot;) and seven European Championships (&quot;1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003&quot;). At last 3 events she appeared as the captain of Russian national team (2002 World championship, 2003 European championship, 2004 Olympic Games).

At 1998 World championship where Elena led Russia to silver medals she was awarded by MVP (Most Valuable Player) prize and in 2002 World championship (where she also brought Russians to become the vice-champions) Elena Baranova was selected to the World&#x27;s Top 5 Team.

1991 European Champion as a member of USSR team (the last competition where USSR team took part), Elena led her country to the first Russian Gold medals in basketball at 2003 European Championship, where she also was selected to Europe &#x27;Top 5 Team&#x27;.

<text>Karl Kling (; 16 September 1910 – 18 March 2003) was a German racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One at 11 Grands Prix from to .

An employee of Daimler-Benz since the mid-1930s, Kling made his Formula One debut at the 1954 French Grand Prix, where he finished second to Mercedes teammate Juan Manuel Fangio, becoming the first German driver to score a podium finish in Formula One. He participated in 10 further World Championship Grands Prix, achieving another podium at the 1955 British Grand Prix and scoring a total of 17 championship points.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Kling became the head of Mercedes-Benz in motorsport from 1956 to 1968.

==Early life and career==

Kling was born on 16 September 1910 in Giessen, Grand Duchy of Hesse, German Empire.

It is said, that he was born too late and too early. Too late to be in the successful Mercedes team of the 1930s and too early to have a real chance in and . Unusually, Kling found his way into motorsport via his first job as a reception clerk at Daimler-Benz in the mid-1930s, competing in hillclimb and trials events in production machinery in his spare time. During the Second World War he gained mechanical experience servicing Luftwaffe aircraft, and after the cessation of hostilities he resumed his motorsport involvement in a BMW 328.

Kling was instrumental in developing Mercedes&#x27; return to international competition in the early 1950s, and his win in the 1952 Carrera Panamericana road race, driving the then-experimental Mercedes-Benz 300SL was a defining point in assuring the Daimler-Benz management that motorsport had a place in Mercedes&#x27; future. Called up to the revived Mercedes Grand Prix squad in 1954 he finished less than one second behind the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio on his Formula One debut, taking second place in the 1954 French Grand Prix at the fast Reims-Gueux circuit. This promising start was not to last, and with the arrival of Stirling Moss at Mercedes in 1955 Kling was effectively demoted to third driver. However, away from the World Championship, Kling took an impressive victory in the Berlin Grand Prix at AVUS, another high-speed circuit. 

Having won all world championships they competed for, F1 in 1954 and 1955, plus sports cars in 1955, Mercedes retired from international racing after 1955 to focus on road car development. Kling succeeded Alfred Neubauer as head of Mercedes motorsport, with stock models only. He was in this post during their successful rallying campaigns of the 1960s, occasionally taking the wheel himself. On one such occasion he drove a Mercedes-Benz 220SE to victory in the mighty 1961 trans-African Algiers-Cape Town Rally.

He died in 2003 at the age of 92.

<doc id="1235754" wikidata="Q171893" url="?curid=1235754" title="Lucien Bianchi">
<text>Luciano &quot;Lucien&quot; Bianchi (, ; 10 November 1934 – 30 March 1969) was an Italian-born Belgian racing driver who raced for the Cooper, ENB, UDT Laystall and Scuderia Centro Sud teams in Formula One. He entered a total of 19 Formula One World Championship races, scoring six points and had a best finish of third at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix.

He also drove in 13 consecutive 24 Hours of Le Mans (1956–1968), finishing 1st in Class three times, including the 1st overall win at the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, with co-driver Pedro Rodríguez. Bianchi died in a crash while testing for the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Personal life==
Bianchi was born in Milan, Italy, but moved to Belgium in 1946 with his father, who before the Second World War was a race mechanic working in the Alfa Romeo competition department. His brother, Mauro Bianchi, also became a racing driver. They drove to victory together in the 1965 Nürburgring 500 km. Mauro later won the P1.6 class at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. His grandnephew, Jules Bianchi, who made his Formula One debut with the Marussia team for the season competing under the French flag, died in 2015, having never regained consciousness after a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.

==Racing career==
Lucien Bianchi&#x27;s first race event was at the Alpine Rally in 1951. He won the 1957, 1958 and 1959 &quot;Tour de France&quot; as well as the Paris 1000 sports car race in the latter two years.

He entered Formula One in 1959, although only with sporadic appearances at first. He drove various cars under the banner of the ENB team, including a Cooper T51, a Lotus 18 and an Emeryson. After a couple of races for the UDT Laystall team in 1961, driving another Lotus, he returned to ENB for whom he drove their ENB-Maserati. He finally secured a more regular drive in Formula One in 1968, with the Cooper-BRM team, although success was elusive despite a bright start. Bianchi managed his best Formula One performance, finishing third at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, in his first race for Cooper.

Bianchi also raced touring cars, sports cars and rally cars, being successful in all disciplines, his biggest victories coming in the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, behind the wheel of a Ford GT40 with Pedro Rodríguez and at Sebring in 1962 with Jo Bonnier. He was also leading the 1968 London–Sydney Marathon when his Citroën DS collided with a non-competing car on the closed course near Nowra, 100 km south of Sydney.

He was killed when his Alfa Romeo T33 spun into a telegraph pole during Le Mans testing in 1969.

At Circuit Zolder, the fourth turn of the circuit, entering the back stretch, is named LucienBianchiBocht in his memory.

<text>The Ilhas Cagarras (Cagarras Islands) are an uninhabited archipelago located off Ipanema, a major beach of the southern coast of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They have been designated a federal natural monument since 2010.

==Location==

The archipelago is in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
It has an area of .
It is an important area for fisheries and tourism, and is subjected to upwelling of cold waters during summer.
The water quality is relatively poor due to its close proximity with Rio&#x27;s city waste water disposal. 
The islands are nonetheless frequented by day excursions of eco-tourists.
The archipelago consists of the following islands (&quot;ilha&quot; in Portuguese means island, &quot;ilhota&quot; = islet):

* Ilha Cagarra
* Ilha de Palmas
* Ilha Comprida
* Ilha Filhote
* Ilhota Grande
* Laje de Cagarra

The first three are the largest. Ilha Cagarra, the island group&#x27;s namesake, is the tallest (79m/259 ft.) and most visible from land.
Although the islands Ilha Redonda and Ilha Redondinha are located nearby, they are not part of the Cagarras archipelago.

==Origin of the name==

There is no consensus among authors about the origin of the name of this archipelago. The most commonly accepted version says that the toponymy would be due to the large amount of excrement (in Portuguese, &quot;cagádas&quot; ) of seabirds that live, nest and feed on these islands. After feeding mainly on fish, these birds excrete their feces, rich in calcium, on the rocky slopes of the islands, staining them white. This hue is clearly visible from the shore of Ipanema, one of the south beaches of Rio de Janeiro

In 1730, its main island, appears on a nautical chart with a Frenchified name &quot;Island Cagade.&quot; In another letter, dated 1767, the same appears with the island carrying its name in Portuguese: &quot;Crappy Island.&quot; &quot;Ilha Cagáda&quot;

Another possibility for its name, is that Portuguese sailors wrongly identified the frigatebirds (fragatas in Portuguese) that nest on these islands, with the Cory&#x27;s shearwater (cagarras in Portuguese) seabirds that live in the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores (Portuguese territories): the shearwater or cagarra (&quot;Calonectris borealis&quot;) is not found on Brazilian islands.

==History of the Archipelago==

The islands are situated in proximity to the discharge in the sea of sewage from almost all the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro, through the Ipanema canal, an important work of sanitary engineering built in the 1970s in accordance with the Protocol of Annapolis.
CONAMA proposed making the Ilhas Cagarras Archipelago and Area of Relevant Ecological Interest on 14 September 1989, but nothing was done at the time.
Creation of the natural monument was due to the initiative of Mr Fernando Gabeira of the Green Party.

On 13 April 2010 the incumbent vice president José Alencar signed a decree creating the Cagarras Islands Natural Monument.
The purpose was to preserve the remnants of the island ecosystem in the Atlantic Forest domain, to preserve the scenic beauty, and to maintain a refuge and nesting area for migratory shorebirds. The monument consisted of the Cagarras, Palmas and Comprida islands and the Filhote da Cagarra islet, as well as the water for around the land.
Any activity that could damage the ecosystem or disturb the aquatic fauna and sea birds was prohibited.
The consultative council was created on 14 December 2010.
The natural monument is part of the Carioca Mosaic, created in 2011.

<doc id="1235762" wikidata="Q481752" url="?curid=1235762" title="Ace of Spades (Motörhead album)">
<text>Ace of Spades is the fourth studio album by English rock band Motörhead, released in October 1980 via Bronze Records. It is the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, peaking at number four on the UK Albums Chart and reaching gold status in the UK by March 1981. It was preceded by the release of the title track as a single in October, which peaked in the UK Singles Chart at No. 15 in early November.

It was the band&#x27;s debut release in the United States, with Mercury Records handling distribution in North America. In 2020, the album was ranked at 408 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

==Background==
By 1979, Motörhead had released two extremely successful classic albums, &quot;Overkill&quot; and &quot;Bomber&quot;, and had gained a loyal fan following by constant touring and television appearances. Their ferocious, loud proto-thrash playing style appealed equally to punks and heavy metal fans, but in 1979 &quot;Sounds&quot; writer Geoff Barton coined the term &quot;New Wave of British Heavy Metal&quot; (NWOBHM) to classify a slew of newer bands such as Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, and Saxon. Motörhead – a band that resented being labeled anything other than rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll – was placed in this new genre, which would go on to influence the emerging thrash metal movement that would include bands like Metallica and Megadeth. In the 2011 book &quot;Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead&quot;, Joel McIver quotes vocalist and bassist Lemmy: 

Regardless, the association with NWOBHM would be another positive element in the increasing momentum that would lead to the band&#x27;s most successful commercial period at the beginning of the new decade. In fact, United Artists decided to finally release the band&#x27;s &quot;lost&quot; first album at this time under the title &quot;On Parole&quot;, which had originally been recorded in 1976 but shelved because it was deemed commercially unviable. Next, the Big Beat label, which had taken over Chiswick&#x27;s catalogue, released &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot;, packaging four extra tracks that the band had laid down for their debut album. Further evidence of Motörhead&#x27;s nascent mainstream success was the release of the EP &quot;The Golden Years&quot; in May 1980 on Bronze Records, which became their highest charting release to date, peaking at No. 8.

==Recording==
Motörhead recorded &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; with Vic Maile at Jackson&#x27;s Studios in Rickmansworth in August and September 1980. Maile, who had worked with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and the Who, had crossed paths with Lemmy when he was a member of Hawkwind. The bassist recalls in his 2002 memoir &quot;White Line Fever&quot;:

As Steffan Chirazi observes in the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;: 
Maille, who was affectionately nicknamed &quot;Turtle&quot; by the band (for his resemblance to the reptile), was critical in giving Motörhead a sleeker sound on record without sacrificing its raw power. Diminutive and soft-spoken, Maille was well equipped to deal with the trio, who were notorious for in-fighting and general unmanageability. In the documentary &quot;The Guts and the Glory&quot;, drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor remembers:

In 2015, Clarke recalled to John Robinson of &quot;Uncut&quot;:

Whereas the band had previously had an input at the mixing stage, Maile took sole responsibility here, Clarke explaining that the result was &quot;you can finally hear everything that&#x27;s going on.&quot; Of the performances, Lemmy stated &quot;Vic got me singing instead of just shouting all the time&quot;, while Taylor added &quot;and he got me playing more solid.&quot;

== Composition ==
The album includes some of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;The Chase Is Better Than the Catch&quot;, &quot;(We Are) the Road Crew&quot;, and the hit single &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, which rose to No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart. In his autobiography, &quot;White Line Fever&quot;, Lemmy speaks at length about the tune:
In 2011, Lemmy admitted to James McNair of &quot;Mojo&quot;:

The song &quot;(We Are) the Road Crew&quot; was written as a tribute to the band&#x27;s roadies. In the 2004 &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary on the making of the album, guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke declares:

In the same film, Lemmy, who worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and the Nice, recalls that he wrote the song &quot;in ten minutes&quot; and that when roadie Ian &quot;Eagle&quot; Dobbie heard the song &quot;he had a tear in his eye&quot;. Many of the songs, such as &quot;Love Me Like a Reptile&quot;. &quot;The Chase Is Better Than the Catch&quot;, and &quot;Jailbait&quot;. blatantly reference sex, which drew the ire of some critics and feminists. Clarke explained to &quot;Classic Albums&quot; in 2005:

The Mercury Records vinyl release has an entirely different track order, which many fans feel is a better delivery of the album as a whole.

==Release==
Motörhead appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; twice in October to promote the single &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, and were guests on the ITV children&#x27;s morning show &quot;Tiswas&quot; on 8 November. The band undertook a UK tour from 22 October through to 2 December under the banner &quot;Ace Up Your Sleeve&quot;, with support from Girlschool and Vardis. After the Belfast show on 2 December, hijinks resulted in Taylor breaking his neck forcing him to wear a neck-brace and curtailing any further band activity. The other members of the band took the opportunity to collaborate with Girlschool for the &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; EP.

==Artwork==
Like the song &quot;Shoot You in the Back&quot;, the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; artwork employs a classic wild west motif. Originally the idea for the album cover was to have it in a sepia tone and have gunfighters at a card table, but the band decided against it. They decided instead to have themselves in the desert dressed as cowboys. The &#x27;Arizona desert-style&#x27; pictures used on the album sleeve and tour programme were taken during a photo session at a sandpit in Barnet. Each of their cowboy outfits were based on different type of Western protagonist. Eddie was based on Clint Eastwood&#x27;s character, The Man with No Name from the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;. Phil&#x27;s costume was based on Marlon Brando&#x27;s character Rio in &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;. Lemmy&#x27;s costume was claimed by Phil to be inspired from Bret Maverick from the TV show &quot;Maverick&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, the sky was not real and was airbrushed in due to it being very cloudy that day.

==Critical reception==

The album has been described as &quot;one of the best metal albums by any band, ever&quot; and a significantly influential &quot;hard rock classic&quot;. Robert Christgau stated: &quot;Punks have never bought his leather jacket and indie connections because Lemmy Kilmister&#x27;s grizzled-biker-born-to-rock is metal without the heavy—no preening solos or blow-dried bullshit. I recommend the bit where he promises to get fast and loose with his latest receptacle as soon as he finishes the song about it (not her, of course not), and note that his writing is more one-note than need be, wit and all--fucking for the hell of it can drive anybody into a rage, and tuneless fucking for the hell of it is really pointless.&quot; AllMusic calls it &quot;rock-solid, boasting several superlative standouts&quot; and insists it &quot;rightly deserves its legacy as a classic&quot;. Sid Smith of BBC Music enthused in 2007: 

Despite the band always referring to their music as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, the album, and particularly its title track, have been considered amongst the most influential in the development of thrash metal. The title track is, for many, the definitive Motörhead anthem. 

The album is listed in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2020, it was ranked at 408 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

==&quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary==
On 28 March 2005, the documentary about the album (a part of the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series) was released on DVD by Eagle Vision. The in-depth look at the making of the album includes interviews with and performances by Lemmy, Phil Taylor and Eddie Clarke.

==Track listing==
===International version===
===Original US version===
===Castle Communications 1996 CD reissue===

===Sanctuary Records 2005 2-CD deluxe edition===

Disc one includes the original album without bonus tracks.

* &quot;Dirty Love&quot; is an official release by Eddie Clarke on Receiver Records Ltd. in 1989 (which nonetheless features the name &quot;Motörhead&quot; on the front and back album covers), which had various outtakes from the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; sessions on it. It includes the tracks &quot;Hump on your Back&quot;, &quot;Waltz of the Vampire&quot;, &quot;Bastard&quot; and &quot;Godzilla Akimbo&quot;, which are all demos that never got to be mastered at the time, but were done so in poor quality later for this release. These four tracks are also credited to Clarke solely on this release, even though it is the three members of Motörhead playing on the tracks.
* The 1996 reissue is missing Girlschool covering &quot;Bomber&quot;, and the 2005 reissue is missing the tracks completely, from the &quot;St. Valentines Day Massacre&quot; EP the bands did in 1981 for their shared label Bronze Records.

===BMG 40th anniversary deluxe edition===
On 30 October 2020, BMG released a deluxe box set of the album, which includes seven 12&quot; LPs, one 10&quot; EP and a DVD. Beside the normal album, which is presented in a special 40th Anniversary Master, the box set included the album &quot;Riders Wearing Black&quot;, which is a live recording made on 23 December 1981, at the Whitla Hall in Belfast. Another live recording, made on 5 March 1981, at Parc Expo in Orleans, is called &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Hand&quot;. The rarity collection is called &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot;. The set comes with a 10&quot; EP, which includes seven instrumental demos, titles &quot;A Fistful Of Instrumentals&quot;. Pre-orders from the official shop of the band were able to receive a Dutch replica of the &quot;Ace Of Spades&quot; single, with the instrumental of the song on the b-side.

<text>Écurie Nationale Belge (the accurate name being Équipe Nationale Belge or ENB) was a Formula One and sportscar racing team in the 1950s and 1960s, which was formed through a merger of Jacques Swaters&#x27; Écurie Francorchamps and Johnny Claes&#x27; Écurie Belge. However, Écurie Francorchamps remained active independently, entering works and privately owned Ferraris.

In Formula One, the team used a variety of different chassis through the years: Ferrari, Cooper, Lotus, Emeryson as well as a car of their own construction, the ENB, which participated in a single World Championship Grand Prix, the 1962 German Grand Prix and was designed by one of the teams co-founder&#x27;s Jacques Coune.

<doc id="1235771" wikidata="Q6664342" url="?curid=1235771" title="Local ecumenical partnership">
<text>In England and Wales, a local ecumenical partnership (or project) is a partnership between churches of different denominations. First piloted in 1964, over 850 now exist to promote unity between different Christian denominations.

The missiologist David Bosch in his &quot;Transforming Mission&quot; recognised ecumenism as the most recent paradigm of mission emerging from the worldwide Church. The main thrust of ecumenism is that despite the theological and cultural differences evident between denominations, the mission of any local Church is made more effective through a united witness. In some cases this has meant that a Christian presence has been retained in areas where neither denomination would be able to continue on its own. In addition, ecumenism encourages the sharing of different worship styles, the development of mutual understanding and the ability for the Church to speak with a united voice on social justice issues. Materials from organisations with a strong ecumenical emphasis, such as the Iona Community and Taizé, are evidence of this.

As a result of the Anglican-Methodist Covenant, Anglicans and Methodists are committed to working in partnership with an end goal of achieving full visible unity.

<doc id="1235773" wikidata="Q1465751" url="?curid=1235773" title="Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême">
<text>Louis Antoine of France, Duke of Angoulême (6 August 1775 – 3 June 1844) was the elder son of Charles X and the last Dauphin of France from 1824 to 1830. He is identified by the Guinness World Records as the shortest-reigning monarch, reigning for less than 20 minutes during the July Revolution, but this is not backed up by historical evidence. He never reigned over the country, but after his father&#x27;s death in 1836, he was the legitimist pretender as Louis XIX.

He was a &quot;petit-fils de France&quot; at birth, and was initially known as Louis Antoine d&#x27;Artois. After his father&#x27;s accession to the throne, he became &quot;Dauphin de France&quot;, and his surname changed to de France, following the royal custom for princes with such rank.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Louis Antoine was born at the Palace of Versailles, as the eldest son of Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, the youngest brother of King Louis XVI. He was born one year after the death of his great-grandfather, King Louis XV and 7 years after the death of his great-grandmother, the Queen Marie Leszczyńska. His mother was Princess Maria Theresa of Savoy (known as &quot;Marie Thérèse&quot; in France), daughter of Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia of Spain.

From 1780 to 1789, Louis Antoine and his younger brother, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, were educated by their &quot;gouverneur&quot; Armand-Louis, Marquis of Sérent in the château de Beauregard, located away from Versailles. On the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, the two young princes followed their father into exile first to Turin, then Germany, and finally England. In 1792, Louis Antoine joined the émigré army of his cousin, the Prince of Condé.

In June 1795, his uncle, the &quot;comte de Provence&quot;, proclaimed himself King Louis XVIII. Later that year, the 20-year-old Louis Antoine led an unsuccessful royalist uprising in the Vendée. In early 1797, he joined his brother and uncle in the German Duchy of Brunswick, hoping to join the Austrian Army. The defeat of Austria by France obliged them to flee, and they took refuge in Mittau, Courland, under the protection of Tsar Paul I of Russia.

There, on 10 June 1799, Louis Antoine married his first cousin, Marie Thérèse of France, the eldest child of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the only member of the immediate royal family to survive the French Revolution. Since her release from the Temple Prison in 1795, she had been living at the Austrian court. They had no children.

===Military service===
In April 1800, Louis Antoine took command of a regiment of cavalry in the Bavarian army and took part in the battle of Hohenlinden against the French, showing some ability.

In early 1801, Tsar Paul made peace with Napoleon Bonaparte, and the French court in exile fled to Warsaw, then controlled by Prussia. For the next ten years, Louis Antoine accompanied and advised his uncle, Louis XVIII. They returned to Russia when Alexander I became Tsar, but in mid-1807 the treaty between Napoleon and Alexander forced them to take refuge in Britain. There, at Hartwell House, King Louis reconstituted his court, and Louis-Antoine was granted an allowance of £300 a month. Twice (in 1807 and 1813) he attempted to return to Russia to join the fight against Napoleon, but was refused by the Tsar. 

Louis Antoine remained in Britain until 1814 when he sailed to Bordeaux, which had declared for the King. His entry into the city on 12 March 1814 was regarded as the beginning of the Bourbon Restoration in France. From there, Louis Antoine fought alongside the Duke of Wellington to bring about Napoleon&#x27;s overthrow.

===Flight to Britain and return===

Louis Antoine was, as chief of the royalist army in the southern Rhône River valley, unable to prevent the return of Napoleon to Paris, and he was again forced to flee to Britain during the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;. He loyally served Louis XVIII after the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. In 1823, he commanded a French army sent into Spain to restore the Spanish King&#x27;s absolute powers, known as the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis. He was victorious in the Battle of Trocadero, after which the reactionary power of King Ferdinand VII of Spain was firmly restored. For this achievement, he was offered the title of &quot;Prince of Trocadero&quot;.

Upon the Louis XVIII&#x27;s death in 1824, his father became King Charles X and Louis Antoine became Dauphin, heir-apparent to the throne. He attended his father&#x27;s coronation in Reims in May 1825.

===July Revolution===
In the July Revolution of 1830, masses of angry demonstrators demanded the abdication of Charles. He reluctantly signed the document of abdication on 2 August 1830. It is said that Louis Antoine, who relinquished his right to the throne, became king &quot;Louis XIX&quot; between his father&#x27;s signature and his own, but in the abdication document he is only referred as &quot;Louis Antoine&quot;. The document was signed in favour of his nephew Henri, duke of Bordeaux. For the final time he left for exile, where he was known as the &quot;count of Marnes&quot;.

Louis Antoine and his wife travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland, in November 1830 and took up residence in a house at 21 (now 22) Regent Terrace near Holyrood Palace where Charles X was staying.

Emperor Francis I of Austria offered the Prague Castle in Prague to the royal entourage in 1832, so Louis-Antoine and Charles X moved there. Francis I, however, died in 1835, and his successor Ferdinand I told the French royal family that he needed the palace for his coronation in the summer of 1836. The exiled French kings and their entourage therefore left and eventually arrived at the palace of Grafenberg in Görz, Austria on 21 October 1836.

Many legitimists did not recognize the abdications as valid, and recognized Charles X as king until his death in 1836, with Louis Antoine succeeding him as Louis XIX. Louis Antoine died in Görz in 1844, aged 68. He was buried in his father Charles X&#x27;s crypt in the church of the Franciscan monastery of Kostanjevica in Nova Gorica, Slovenia. Upon his death, his nephew the Duke of Bordeaux became head of the Bourbon royal family of France under the regnal name Henry V, although he used the title of Count of Chambord in exile.

==In fiction and film==
The newborn Duke of Angoulême is portrayed by an uncredited child actor in a brief scene in the movie &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), directed by Sofia Coppola. This scene contains an error, as it mistakenly names his parents as the Count and Countess of Provence, who never had children.

<text>Ludovico Scarfiotti (18 October 1933 – 8 June 1968) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Scarfiotti won the 1966 Italian Grand Prix with Ferrari. In endurance racing, Scarfiotti won the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 12 Hours of Sebring, both in 1963 with Ferrari.

Born in Turin, Scarfiotti was the grandson of Lodovico Scarfiotti, co-founder and former president of Fiat. He initially competed in sportscar racing, racing for Ferrari from 1960 onwards. He finished third in the 1962 1000 km of Paris before winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in alongside Lorenzo Bandini, driving the Ferrari 250 P. His victory at Le Mans—along with his win at the 12 Hours of Sebring—prompted his Formula One debut with Ferrari at the 1963 Dutch Grand Prix. Scarfiotti made sporadic appearances for the team over the next five seasons, including his sole win at the in . He added to his sportscar success with a runner-up finish at Le Mans in , as well as at the 24 Hours of Daytona. After a one-off appearance for Eagle in , Scarfiotti signed for Cooper the following season.

A motorsports competitor for a decade, Scarfiotti had also won the sportscar class of the European Hillclimb Championship in 1962 and 1965. In June 1968, Scarfiotti died at a hillclimbing event in the German Alps when he crashed his Porsche 910.

==Early life==
Scarfiotti was born in Turin. Scarfiotti was associated with cars from his youth. His grandfather was the first president and one of the nine founders of the Fiat automobile company.

==Sports car competition==

Scarfiotti competed in the 1,000 Kilometres de Paris sports car race in October 1962. He finished third with teammate Colin Davis. The event was won by Pedro Rodríguez and Ricardo Rodríguez driving a Ferrari. Partnered with Lorenzo Bandini, Scarfiotti was victorious in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June 1963. Their factory Ferrari achieved an average speed of 117.99 miles per hour over a distance of . The victory was worth almost $20,000 in various prize money along with prestige, and gave Ferrari its fourth consecutive Le Mans victory. 

In 1965, John Surtees and Scarfiotti shared a Ferrari 330 P2 Spyder which gave the marque a fourth consecutive victory at the 1000km Nürburgring race. They led throughout the 44 laps, posting a winning time of 6 hours, 53 minutes, and 5 seconds, for an average speed of . Scarfiotti and Bandini drove a 2-litre Dino 206 S to second place in the 1966 running of the 1,000 kilometre Nürburgring in which first place went to Phil Hill and Joakim Bonnier driving a 5.4-litre Chevrolet-powered Chaparral. The Dino was 90 seconds behind the Chaparral that debuted the automatic transmission in European competition.

Surtees severed relations with the Ferrari racing team following their decision to replace him with Scarfiotti at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Scarfiotti would go on to finish 31st, retiring after 123 laps. Scarfiotti joined Mike Parkes in a Ferrari P4 for the 1000 km Spa in May 1967. They finished a lap behind Jacky Ickx and Richard Thompson, who drove a Ford Mirage (race car). The winning team averaged and posted a time of 5 hours, 9 minutes, 46.5 seconds.

Teamed with Mike Parkes, Scarfiotti took the new Ferrari P4 coupe to second place behind the sister car (a P4 spyder) driven by Lorenzo Bandini and Chris Amon at the 24 Hours of Daytona, with Ferrari taking the first three positions. The same result took place at the Monza 1,000 km in April. Scarfiotti, again teamed with Parkes finished second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, this time behind the Ford Mark IV driven by A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney. Scarfiotti raced a Ferrari factory car in the September 1967 200-mile Canadian-American Challenge Cup race held on a course near Bridgehampton, New York. His sponsor was the North American Racing Team of Luigi Chinetti.

After Günter Klass was killed in July 1967, Ferrari retired the two-litre Dino 206S prototypes that were also used in hillclimbing. After a fast 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans race won by a 7-litre V8-powered Ford ahead of Scarfiotti/Parkes, the big engines were banned for the 1968 WSC season in which prototypes were limited to max 3-litre engines, same size as in F1, but those were designed to last for 300 km, not 1000 km or 24 hours. Ferrari was forced to retire the 4-litre V12 Ferrari P series, and in protest to the rule change, did not enter the 1968 World Sportscar Championship. With the Germans also being active in hillclimbing, Scarfiotti joined Porsche.

Scarfiotti entered the 1968 Targa Florio, but wrecked his Porsche 907 (#230) on the first day of qualifying and was forced to race with Porsche&#x27;s T-car which did not last the road race.

==Formula One==
Enzo Ferrari signed Scarfiotti to the Ferrari Formula One team of drivers for along with Surtees, Willy Mairesse, Bandini, and Nino Vaccarella. Scarfiotti placed sixth in the second Ferrari in the 1963 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. He was a lap behind victor Jim Clark in a Lotus. John Surtees piloted the first Ferrari to third place behind Dan Gurney in a Brabham. Scarfiotti finished fifth in the non-championship 1965 Syracuse Grand Prix on the island of Sicily.

Scarfiotti became the first Italian in fifteen years to win the Italian Grand Prix when he drove his Ferrari to a track record speed of at the 1966 event. As of the end of the 2024 Formula One season, Scarfiotti is also the last Italian to win it.

Following the death of Bandini from burns sustained during the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix, Ferrari entered two F1 cars for Scarfiotti and Parkes in the non-championship 1967 Syracuse Grand Prix. Scarfiotti drove a 1966 3-litre Ferrari 312 whereas Parkes drove a 1967 with the 1966 nose to accommodate his long frame. They shared the victory when they crossed the finish line in an unusual dead heat. They were clocked at , recording an official time of 1 hour 40 minutes 58 seconds for the race. At the GPs of Zandvoort and Spa, both Parkes and Scarfiotti were part of a three-car Scuderia, with a 4-5-6 place finish at the Dutch GP suggesting equal speed of these three drivers, but both Parkes and Scarfiotti were one lap behind Amon, despite Parkes qualifying only 0.1 sec slower than Amon, with Scarfiotti being a full second off pace. At Spa, Parkes had a career-ending accident, while Scarfiotti was 4 laps behind and not classified. For the rest of the 1967 F1 WC Season, Ferrari entered only one car, for Chris Amon. For his home GP at Monza, the winner of the 1966 event secured a drive in the second All American Racers Eagle Mk1, a quite promising move, as Dan Gurney had won the race at the very fast Spa circuit. However, both Weslake V12 failed early in the race.

With Ferrari hiring Jacky Ickx and Amon for 1968, there was no place for Scarfiotti, who entered F1 races for Cooper instead. Brian Redman and Scarfiotti came in third and fourth respectively at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix in Jarama, both driving for Cooper. In his final Formula One appearance, Scarfiotti placed fourth in the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, an event marked by mechanical breakdowns that eliminated 11 of 16 starters before the race was completed.

==Death==
Ludovico Scarfiotti died in 1968 at a hillclimbing event on the Roßfeldhöhenringstraße near Berchtesgaden, Germany, in the German Alps. He became the third Grand Prix driver to die in 1968, following Jim Clark and Mike Spence. Scarfiotti wrecked his Porsche 910 during trials when the car veered abruptly off the Rossfeldstrasse track and catapulted ten yards down a tree-covered slope. The Porsche hung in the trees and Scarfiotti was thrown from the cockpit. He was discovered, badly injured, fifty yards away. He died in an ambulance of numerous fractures. Huschke von Hanstein, the team manager of Porsche, stated that he had never been associated with a fatal accident during the eighteen years he had been in charge of the team. of burned rubber braking indicated that Scarfiotti had slammed on his brakes at the final moment.

Scarfiotti was married to Ida Benignetti and had two children from a previous relationship.

<text>Mark Neary Donohue Jr. (March 18, 1937 – August 19, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Captain Nice,&quot; and later &quot;Dark Monohue,&quot; was an American race car driver and engineer known for his ability to set up his own race car as well as driving it to victories.

Donohue is probably best known as the driver of the 1500+ bhp &quot;Can-Am Killer&quot; Porsche 917-30 and as the winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 1972. Cars that Donohue raced include: AMC Javelin, AMC Matador, Chevrolet Camaro, Eagle-Offy, Elva Courier, Ford GT40 MK IV, Ferrari 250LM, Ferrari 512, Lola T70, Lola T330, Lotus 20, McLaren M16, Porsche 911, Porsche 917/10, Porsche 917/30, Shelby Cobra, and Shelby Mustang GT350R.

==Early life==
Born in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Donohue grew up in Summit, graduated from the Pingry School in Hillside, and entered Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. At the age of 22 while a senior at Brown, Donohue began racing his 1957 Corvette. He won the first event he entered, a hillclimb in Belknap County, New Hampshire. He graduated from Brown in 1959 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering.

Donohue won the SCCA national championship in an Elva Courier in 1961. Experienced race driver Walt Hansgen (who worked for Inskip Motors in New York &amp; Rhode Island) recognized Donohue&#x27;s ability and befriended him, eventually providing an MGB (through Inskip Motors in Providence, RI and prepped by their race shop Competition Engineering) for Donohue to race at the 1964 Bridgehampton 
 SCCA endurance event, which he won. Hansgen arranged for Donohue to become his teammate in 1965, co-driving a Ferrari 275 at the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race, which they finished in 11th place. That year, Donohue also won two divisional championships: in SCCA B Class in a GT350 and in SCCA Formula C in a Lotus 20B.

Donohue was hired on March 29, 1964, by Jack Griffith [Griffith Motors, Syosset, N.Y./Plainview, N.Y.] as design engineer for the Griffith, formerly TVR Grantura Mk III, powered by a Ford 289 cid (4.7l) V8 engine. He went on to assist TVR&#x27;s David Hives in designing the Series 400 Griffith and then working on the ill-fated Bob Cumberford-designed, Intermeccanica-(Torino, Italy) produced Series 600 Griffith.
During its production life, there were 192 Series 200 Griffiths built, 59 of the Series 400 and only 10 of the Series 600.
During his tenure at Griffith Mark drove the Griffith-owned Shelby 289 Cobra making his mark on the SCCA circuit.
In February of &#x27;65 Donohue was named comptroller at Griffith Motors, but was soon lured from Griffith by Roger Penske early in 1966.
The Griffith company went defunct in November, 1966.

==Ford GT40 and joining with Penske==
In 1966, thanks to his friendship with Hansgen, word quickly spread to the Ford Motor Company about the young driver. Ford immediately signed Donohue to drive one of their GT-40 Mk II race cars campaigned at the 24 Hours of Le Mans by the Holman &amp; Moody racing team. Le Mans proved frustrating for Donohue. Hansgen died while testing the GT40 in preparation for Le Mans so Donohue partnered with Australian Paul Hawkins. Donohue and Hawkins completed only twelve laps due to differential failure and finished 47th. Earlier that year, co-driving with Hansgen, Donohue finished third at the 24 Hours of Daytona and second at the 12 Hours of Sebring.

At Hansgen&#x27;s funeral, Roger Penske spoke to Donohue about driving for him. In his first race for Penske, at Watkins Glen in June 1966, Donohue qualified well but crashed the car at the top of a hill, destroying it.

Donohue was invited back to Le Mans by Ford in 1967. Ford had developed a new GT, the Mark IV. Donohue co-drove in the No. 4 yellow car with sports car driver and race car builder Bruce McLaren for Shelby American Racing. The two drivers disagreed on many aspects of racing and car setup, but as a team were able to muster a fourth-place finish in the endurance classic.

In 1967, Penske contacted Donohue about driving Penske&#x27;s brand new Lola T70 spyder in the United States Road Racing Championship. Donohue dominated the 1967 race, driving a Lola T70 MkIII Chevrolet for Penske. Donohue raced in seven of the eight races that year, winning six (at Las Vegas, Riverside, Bridgehampton, Watkins Glen, Pacific Raceways, and Mid-Ohio) and finishing third at the Laguna Seca Raceway round behind Lothar Motschenbacher and Mike Goth.

In 1968, Donohue and Penske returned to defend their USRRC championship with the McLaren M6A Chevrolet. Donohue did not start the first race of the year at Circuit Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City due to problems getting the engine to start. Despite this, Donohue still dominated the series, even though he suffered three DNFs during the season due to mechanical problems with the M6A.

In 1969 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona driving a Lola-Chevrolet T70 for Penske.

==Trans-Am==
Donohue began his Trans-Am series campaign in 1967, winning three of twelve races in a Roger Penske-owned Chevrolet Camaro. In 1967 and 1968, Trans-Am schedule included two of the most prized endurance races in the world, the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. Donohue finished fourth at Daytona and won the Trans-Am class at the 12 Hours of Sebring.

1968 was a banner year for Donohue in the Trans-Am series, as he successfully defended his 12 Hours of Sebring victory by partnering with Craig Fisher and driving his Penske Chevrolet Camaro to victory. Donohue went on to win 10 of 13 races, a Trans-Am series record which stood until Tommy Kendall went 11 for 13 in the 1997 Trans-Am championship, winning the first 11 races that year in his All-Sport liveried Mustang.

Donohue was considered a leading Trans-Am driver of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Had there been a Drivers&#x27; Championship in place at the time, he would have won three of them (his last in 1971) while driving Camaros in 1968 and 1969, and an AMC Javelin in 1971, all for Roger Penske Racing.

During their enormous success in Trans-Am, Penske and Donohue began to experiment with their Camaros. They discovered that using a drag racing trick of dipping a car in an acid bath would eat away small amounts of metal, which in turn made the car incrementally lighter, and allowed it to be driven faster. The 1967 Z-28 won its last race by lapping the entire field of cars, causing suspicion throughout the paddock.

During a post-race inspection, race stewards discovered that the car was 250 pounds lighter than the 2,800-pound minimum weight requirement. Donohue was about to have his race victory taken away for cheating, but Roger Penske stepped in. Penske warned that any disqualification would have the potential of motivating Chevrolet to pull all support for the Trans-Am series. After considering the potential consequences, the race stewards allowed Donohue&#x27;s victory to stand, but the rules for the 1968 season incorporated a change whereby all cars would be weighed during the technical inspection before the race.

Penske and Donohue did not stop acid-dipping after this, however. Continuing the practice of reducing weight allowed them to place weights of certain sizes strategically in specific locations within the car, thus helping to balance the car while being driven on the limit. Acid-dipping car bodies was prevalent with competing Trans-Am teams also.

They continued to use the &quot;lightweight&quot; car in 1968, at the Sebring 12-hour race. They changed the grille and taillight to the 1968 model, and then painted both cars identically. They sent the legal weight car through the technical inspection with the number 15 and again with the number 16 on it. Then they put both cars in the race, number 15 and 16, one car being 250 pounds lighter. They won their class in the race, finishing third overall, and went on to win 10 out of 13 races that year.

They also acid-dipped the body on the Camaro and had to caution people not to lean against it, for fear it would dent. The lightweight car was featured on an episode of &quot;Dream Car Garage&quot; on Speed TV in 2005.

In 1970 new Javelin team owner Roger Penske and driver Mark Donohue breathed new life into the AMC team. Donohue drove the Javelin to three victories, with AMC finishing second overall in the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship. In 1971, of the ten races that the Over 2.5L Class cars participated in, Donohue won seven of them, including the final six races in a row, with AMC winning the Manufacturers&#x27; championship for the first time ever. In the final race of the season, Javelins finished in first, second and third place, with George Follmer becoming the only other Javelin driver to win besides Donohue.

==Indianapolis 500==

In 1969, Penske and Donohue raced in their first Indianapolis 500, with Donohue finishing seventh, winning the rookie of the year award. Donohue raced at Indianapolis each year following, finishing second in 1970 and 25th in 1971.

Donohue won in 1972, driving for Penske. He finished the race in his McLaren-Offy setting a record speed of over , which stood for twelve years. The victory was the first for Penske in the Indy 500.

==NASCAR==

Donohue raced in several NASCAR Grand American races and a NASCAR pony car division from 1968 until 1971. In the 1972–1973 season, driving an AMC Matador for Penske Racing in NASCAR&#x27;s top division, the Winston Cup Series, Donohue won the season-opening event at Riverside. That race was Penske&#x27;s first NASCAR win in a long history of NASCAR participation. Although photographs of Donohue with the more aerodynamic 1974 Matador coupe exist and are published, he did not drive it in competition.

==Can-Am Porsche==
Between 1971 and 1972, Penske Racing (along with Donohue as the primary test and development driver) was commissioned by Porsche to help develop the 917-10 to compete in the Can-Am series. During testing at Road Atlanta, Donohue recommended larger brake ducts, believing that more cooling would slow the brakes&#x27; degradation during a race.

The Porsche engineers obliged, but the new ducts interfered with the bodywork closure pins that attached body panels to the car. Coming out of turn seven at about , the rear bodywork flew off the car, which became extremely unstable, lifted off the ground, and tumbled down the track. The front of the car was torn away, leaving Donohue, still strapped to his safety seat, with his legs dangling outside the car. Amazingly, Donohue only suffered an internal derangement of his knee with meniscus damage and limited cruciate plus collateral ligament damage. (He was operated on at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta by Drs. J. Funk and J. L. Watts.) George Follmer, Donohue&#x27;s old Trans-Am teammate, took over testing the 917-10 for Donohue, who said:


Porsche, Penske, and Donohue quickly started the development of the 917-30, complete with a reworked aerodynamic &quot;Paris&quot; body and a 5.4-liter turbocharged flat-12 engine whose output could be adjusted from about 1,100 to 1,500 bhp by turning a boost knob in the cockpit. During the development of this motor, the German Porsche engineers often asked Donohue if the motor finally had enough power. He answered, &quot;It will never have enough power until I can spin the wheels at the end of the straightaway in high gear.&quot;

On August 9, 1975, Donohue drove the 917–30 to a world closed-course speed record at the Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama. His average speed around the high-banked oval was . Donohue held the record for 11 years, until it was broken by Rick Mears at Michigan International Speedway.

The 917-30 is referred to as the &quot;Can-Am killer&quot; as it dominated the competition, winning all but two races of the 1973 Can-Am championship (which is an untrue statement, because OPEC killed the Can-Am series in 1975–1976). After the Arab oil embargo in 1973, it led the SCCA, IMSA and other race series to impose fuel limitations on motor sport racing as a whole, which hampered the performance of the 917/30, making it uncompetitive in the Can-Am series. Brian Redman drove it once in 1974, and that was it for the car as far as Penske campaigning it. The 917/30 generally is considered one of the most powerful and most dominant racing machines ever created.

==First IROC champion==

Donohue raced in the inaugural IROC series in 1973–74, racing identical, specially-prepared Porsche RSRs. In the four-race series, Donohue won the first and third of three races at Riverside and the final race of the year at Daytona. The only person to beat Donohue was his former Penske Trans-Am teammate, George Follmer. In winning the first IROC championship, Donohue beat the best racing drivers of that era from all of the major championships, such as Denny Hulme, Richard Petty, A. J. Foyt, Emerson Fittipaldi, Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Peter Revson, Bobby Unser, and Gordon Johncock.

==Retirement and Formula One==
The pressures of racing and designing the car took their toll on Donohue. By 1973, the &quot;Captain Nice&quot; nickname he had earned earlier in his career was being supplanted by the nickname &quot;Dark Monohue&quot;. Donohue announced that he would retire from racing after the 1973 Can-Am season. In addition, the horrific events at the 1973 Indianapolis 500 and the subsequent death of his friend, Swede Savage, pushed him to quit. His retirement was short-lived, however, as he was lured back to full-time competitive driving by Penske when he formed a Formula One team, Penske Cars Ltd, to compete in the final two events of the Formula One World Championship, and to continue competing in with the new Penske PC1.
Donohue previously had debuted in Formula One in the season on September 19, 1971, with a Penske-sponsored McLaren car entered by the &quot;White Racing&quot; privateer team at the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, finishing on the podium in third place. After coming out of retirement with his former boss, Penske, Donohue returned to Formula One, entering into the final two races of the Formula One season. Donohue finished in 12th place at the Canadian Grand Prix, but failed to finish at the United States Grand Prix.

A full season of racing for the Formula One season was planned. The 1975 season turned out to be a difficult one for Donohue and Penske. Donohue was able to muster fifth-place finishes at the Swedish Grand Prix and the British Grand Prix, but the new Penske PC1 chassis proved problematic, as evidenced by three retirements in the first six races. At the Austrian Grand Prix, Donohue&#x27;s career, along with Roger Penske&#x27;s Formula One aspirations, took a tragic turn.

==Death==

Midway through the 1975 F1 season, Penske abandoned the troublesome PC1 and started using the March 751. Donohue recently had arrived in Austria for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring race track following the successful closed-course speed record attempt at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama just a few days earlier. During a practice session for the race, Donohue lost control of his March after a tire failed, sending him into the catch fencing at Turn 1 (known as Vöest Hügel Kurve). A track marshal was killed by debris from the accident, but Donohue did not appear to be injured significantly. It is said that Donohue&#x27;s head struck either a catch fencing post or the bottom of the wood frame for an advertising billboard located alongside of the racetrack. A headache resulted, however, and worsened. After going to the hospital in Graz the next day, Donohue lapsed into a coma from a cerebral hemorrhage and died. He was survived by his second wife and two sons from his first marriage. Donohue is buried at St. Teresa Cemetery in Summit, New Jersey.

The turn was tightened and became the Hella Licht Esses in 1977. Dononue&#x27;s estate was involved in litigation against Penske and Goodyear that was settled in 1986, claiming tire failure killed Donohue. Goodyear paid the widow and children $9.6 million.

== Commemorations and legacy ==
In 2003, in commemoration of Penske Racing&#x27;s 50th NASCAR win, Nextel Cup driver Ryan Newman drove a Dodge Intrepid painted to resemble Donohue&#x27;s 1973 AMC (with a No. 12 and current Alltel decals) at the fall Rockingham, North Carolina, race.

Penske&#x27;s new Penske Racing complex in Mooresville, North Carolina is decorated with various murals of Donohue and his racing cars, most notably the AMC stock car and the various Porsche prototypes that Donohue drove through his career.

Donohue chronicled his entire racing career in the book, &quot;The Unfair Advantage&quot; (co-written with noted motorsports and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the engineering approach he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always looking for that elusive &quot;unfair advantage&quot;. Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable as the use of a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the antilock braking system and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue&#x27;s death.

The book was re-released in 2000 by Bentley Publishers (Cambridge, Massachusetts). It includes information and additional photography that was not available before the first edition was published.

Donohue&#x27;s racing tradition is carried on by his son, David Donohue, a successful road racer in his own right.

<text>Michael Johnson Parkes (24 September 1931 – 28 August 1977) was a British racing driver and engineer, who competed in Formula One at six Grands Prix from to . In endurance racing, Parkes won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1964 with Ferrari.

Born in Richmond, Surrey, Parkes was the son of John Parkes, chairman and managing director of the Alvis Group. Parkes participated in seven Formula One Grands Prix, debuting at the 1959 British Grand Prix in a Formula Two car entered by Fry. Amidst a successful sportscar racing career, he returned to Formula One with Ferrari in , achieving one pole position, two podiums, and a total of 14 championship points.

Outside of motor racing, Parkes worked as an automotive engineer; whilst working for the Rootes Group, he was involved in the development of the Hillman Imp. From 1974 onwards, he served as principal development engineer of the Lancia Stratos. In August 1977, Parkes died in a road traffic collision near Turin, aged 45.

==Early life==
Michael Johnson Parkes was born on 24 September 1931 in Richmond, Surrey, England. Parkes was the eldest son of John Parkes, who was chairman and managing director of the Alvis Group; he was also an aviator. Parkes studied at Haileybury College in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire.

==Sports car racing career==
Parkes began his racing career in the mid-1950s initially with an MG before moving on to a Frazer Nash. In 1957 he raced a Lotus and came to the attention of Colin Chapman who invited him to act as reserve driver for the works team at Le Mans. He then became involved with the Fry Formula Two project in 1958 and 1959, before returning to sportscars in 1960.

In 1960 Parkes drove a Lotus Elite for Sir Gawaine Baillie before moving to Tommy Sopwith&#x27;s Equipe Endeavour in 1961, where he drove in sportscars and Formula Junior. He also drove a Ferrari GT for UK Ferrari franchise, Maranello Concessionaires. At Le Mans he shared a three-litre Ferrari Testa Rossa with Willy Mairesse and finished second.

In May 1962, Mairesse and Parkes came second in the 1000km Nürburgring race in a Ferrari behind the winning car of the same marque driven by Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. Parkes finished a mere car length
behind Graham Hill in the 28th Royal Automobile Club tourist trophy race in August 1963. Umberto Maglioli and Parkes drove one of the Ferraris which claimed the top five
qualifying positions for the 1964 12 Hours of Sebring. The Ferraris were equipped with new power plants. Parkes was timed at 3:10.4. In the race Parkes established a speed record and completed the most miles ever for a winner.

Parkes and Maglioli, finished a considerable distance ahead of the Ferrari of Ludovico Scarfiotti and Nino Vaccarella. Parkes teamed with Jean Guichet in
a Ferrari to capture the 1,000 kilometre Classic of Monza Italy in April 1965. Tommy Spichiger, 30, of Switzerland, died instantly on the 34th lap of the race when his Ferrari 365 prototype went off the track and burst into flames. Parkes and Guichet led most of the race in their Ferrari prototype, after taking the lead from John Surtees and Ludovico Scarfiotti.

Parkes and Guichet placed 2nd to Surtees and Scarfiotti in a 620-mile race at the Nürburgring in May 1965. The winning pair led the full 44 laps. It was a 4th consecutive victory for Ferrari. Dan Gurney eclipsed the time of Parkes in the sole factory Ferrari in the final practice for the 1966 12 Hours of Sebring. The blue Ford was clocked at 2:54.6, 2 seconds faster than a lap run by Parkes the previous day. In a Ferrari P3 prototype, Parkes lap was so fast &quot;that none of the time-speed conversion charts would accept it.&quot; Parkes and Bob Bondurant started 2nd after Gurney and his co-driver, Jerry Grant.

Surtees and Parkes were in a Ferrari prototype in their victory in a 620-mile Monza sports car event in April 1966. Chris Amon and Lorenzo Bandini were triumphant in a 100 lap, 1,000 kilometre Monza race in April 1967. They drove a four-litre Ferrari for an average speed of 122.30 m.p.h. Parkes and Scarfiotti finished second with a time of 5:10:59.2. The winning time was 5 hours seven minutes, 43 seconds. The Ferraris were in front after the Chaparrals of Phil Hill and Mike Spence had to make pit stops following the 17th and 18th laps. He finished second at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, paired with Ludovico Scarfiotti, in a Ferrari 330P4.

After the crash at the Spa Belgian GP 1967 Parkes returned to race sport cars events in 1970, with remarkable 4th place at the Daytona 24 hours on a Ferrari 312P entered by NART (paired with Sam Posey), at Sebring 12 hours he finished 6th on the same car (together with Chuck Parsons). He continued the season racing on the Filipinetti Ferrari 512S, reaching 5th place at the Targa Florio and 4th at the Nurburgring 1000 km together with Herbert Muller.

Parkes competed in a 1,000 kilometre sports car race in Argentina in January 1971, he was just ahead of Ignazio Giunti&#x27;s Ferrari 312PB when the Italian driver crashed on the Beltoise&#x27;s Matra. He was paired with Joakim Bonnier in a five-litre Ferrari entered and owned by the Swiss Filippinetti stable which maintained operations in Modena. Parkes competed in the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans in a modified Ferrari 512M paired with Henri Pescarolo. He was involved in the development of this car (named 512F, where &quot;F&quot; stands for Filipinetti, the car&#x27;s owner), which proved to be very fast, winning a non-championship race at Vallelunga, Rome ahead of the Jo Siffert Porsche 917K. Parkes-Pescarolo were running well at Le Mans when a mechanical failure during the night ended their race. Parkes came back to Le Mans in 1972 with a Ferrari 365GTB entered by Filipinetti. His teammates were Lafosse and Cochet, the trio finished in seventh place, third in the GT class behind two other Ferraris.

==Formula One career==

Parkes first entered a World Championship Grand Prix at Aintree in 1959 driving a Formula 2 (F2) Fry-Climax 1.5-litre Straight-4. However he did not qualify and returned to sportscars thereafter, apart from a single outing at Mallory Park in 1962 with a Bowmaker Cooper. Following his success with Ferrari sportscars, Parkes joined Ferrari officially, in 1963 as development and reserve driver, and over the following seasons became recognised as a leading sports car driver. When John Surtees unexpectedly left Ferrari in 1966, Parkes was promoted to the Grand Prix team and with an extended chassis to accommodate his height of six feet four inches, was immediately successful, finishing in second place in the 1966 French Grand Prix at Reims. Jack Brabham won the race with his teammate, Denny Hulme, third, in their Brabham–Repcos. However this was followed by two retirements before another second place at Monza where he also took pole position. Parkes won an international Formula One race at Silverstone by one third of a lap over Brabham in April 1967.The 52 lap race was the first Formula One contest for Parkes in his native country. He completed the 152.36 mile competition in 1:19:39.25 with an average speed of 114.65 m.p.h. 
In 1967, Parkes competed in two further Grands Prix for Ferrari finishing fifth at Zandvoort but retiring through accident at Spa, after sliding on oil being sprayed from Jackie Stewart&#x27;s H16 BRM, on the first lap, suffering broken legs that would ultimately end his Grand Prix career.
Ferrari Auto Works entered two cars in the 1967 Syracuse Grand Prix. This was a Formula One race that did not count toward the Formula One World Championship. Parkes and Scarfiotti were assigned 1966 model single seaters.
After Parkes&#x27; Formula One career ended, he raced into the 1970s in sports cars.

==Automotive engineering==
When not racing cars, Parkes worked as an automotive engineer. Parkes worked for the Rootes Group from 1950 to 1962, initially as an apprentice. One of his roles at Rootes was as project engineer in the development of the Hillman Imp.

In 1963 Parkes joined Ferrari as development engineer for their road cars, notably the 330 GTC, and also as a GT sports car driver. Following his absence from work after his serious F1 accident, he returned to Ferrari in 1969 to find the company partly under the control of Fiat and at that point decided to work for Scuderia Filipinetti as engineer as well as driver. His departure from Ferrari was partly due to Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s refusal to allow him to return to F1 after his accident, claiming that he was too valuable as an engineer.

In 1974 Parkes took a job as principal development engineer for the Lancia Stratos.

==Death==
Parkes was killed in a road collision on 28 August 1977 near Riva presso Chieri, Turin, Italy. Parkes was returning home from Modena to Turin—driving his Lancia Beta—when he rear-ended a 43-ton lorry in wet conditions; he was killed instantly.

<text>Writing centers provide students with assistance on their papers, projects, reports, multi-modal documents, web pages, and other writerly needs across disciplines. Although writing center staff are often referred to as tutors, writing centers are primarily places for collaboration in which writers and tutors work together to help writers achieve their goals. Typical services include help with the purpose, structure, function of writing, and are geared toward writers of various levels and fields of study. The goal is to help a writer learn to address the various exigences that they may encounter with the realization that no writing is decontextualized—it always addresses a specific audience. Writing centers may offer one-on-one scheduled tutoring appointments, group tutoring, and writing workshops. Services may also include drop-in hours. Writing tutors do not assign grades to students&#x27; writing assignments.

==Overview==
A writing center usually offers individualized conferencing whereby the writing tutor offers his or her feedback on the piece of writing at hand; a writing tutor&#x27;s main function is to discuss how the piece of writing might be revised. Writing centers generally rely on non-prescriptive and non-corrective approaches to construct a more complete account of how well a piece of writing aligns with the writer&#x27;s aims. In other words, a tutor usually does not proofread nor edit a student&#x27;s work. Instead, the tutor facilitates the student&#x27;s attempts to revise his or her own work by conversing with the student about the topic at hand, discussing principles and processes of writing, modeling rhetorical and syntactical moves for the student to apply, and assisting the student in identifying patterns of grammatical error in his or her writing. In other words, &quot;[the job of writing tutors] is to produce better writers, not better writing.&quot;

== Writing centers at higher education institutions==

=== History===
Historically, writing centers in American universities began appearing as &quot;writing labs&quot; in the early 20th century. Elizabeth Boquet and Stephen North point to the origins of the writing laboratory as first a method, not a place, where &quot;the key characteristic of which appears to have been that all work was to be done during class time&quot;. This was to allow the student to compose with the teacher present, able to help with any revisions or questions the student may have. However, as class sizes and universities grew, Writing Centers began to develop as university institutions, often conceived of as an editing service for students. As post-secondary institutions began accepting more and more students, writing centers were created to help students who were struggling with their writing abilities. It was also at this time when writing centers began to employ student tutors, who were more affordable to hire than Faculty members.

=== Location of writing centers===
Writing centers may be centrally located at higher education institutions. Centers may be located within a student success center, which may offer other academic support services to students such as study skills appointments and workshops. These might typically be called Academic Skills Units or Learning Development Groups. Some writing centers may be part of a writing studies department or stand-alone.

Some institutions also offer an Online Writing Lab (OWL), which generally attempts to follow the model of writing center tutoring in an online environment. These environments have been said to be a step toward a new model of writing centers, a model known as Multiliteracy Centers. Another environment that could fall under this category is a physical space known as a digital studio.

=== Writing consultants===
Depending on the writing center and the target population, consultants may be undergraduate peer consultants, graduate consultants, graduate peer consultants, staff consultants, or faculty consultants. The consultants may be working for pay or for college credit. If the writing center offers workshop or group tutoring sessions, staff, experienced undergraduates, or graduates may serve in an unofficial or official teaching assistant capacity. Writing center research has examined what effect each type of consultant has upon the writer seeking help.

In many cases, writing center directors or writing program administrators (WPAs) are responsible for conducting writing center assessment, and must communicate these results to academic administration and various stakeholders. Assessment is seen as beneficial for writing centers because it creates a professional and ethical environment that is important not just for writing centers but for all higher education.

== Types of writers served==
Writers served by these writing centers may vary depending on the setting. Post-secondary writing centers may serve undergraduate and graduate students in the same or separate facilities; others may be more inclusive, serving students, faculty, staff, GED students, and the general public. High school writing centers service enrolled students only.

=== English-language learners===
Writing centers may serve English-language learners from across academic disciplines who are undergraduate or graduate students at the institution. English-language learners receive one-on-one writing assistance with a tutor, who may be a peer or a writing specialist. The goal is to assist English-language learners with language acquisition and to help students feel more confident in their ability to write effectively in the English language. Writing centers may develop resources and handouts for English-language learners on academic vocabulary and grammatical conventions.

Some English Language Learners may access a writing center specifically for grammatical help and error revision from tutors. This may conflict with the philosophy of a writing center to help students become better writers through discussing the overall flow and organization of the paper, rather than focusing on sentence-level revisions. Student tutors are generally taught not to edit papers during a session. Instead they are taught to collaborate on higher-level issues in their peer&#x27;s paper. Much research has been done on if student tutors should take a more directive approach to teaching writing to English language learners. Ultimately student tutors must receive training on how to effectively teach English as a second language at writing centers so that sessions are effective and meaningful for both English language learners and tutors.

== Writing center theory==
Faculty, students, staff, and administrators often viewed writing centers as places for remediation. At their best, however, they are places where all students, including the best ones, can get better, a place (according to Karen Head), &quot;that returns to the ideal of a safe space for active debate and discourse about the best ways to communicate in a variety of modes.&quot; Collaboration in theory and practice is one particular idea of a writing center, although creating collaborative environment is really difficult. Collaboration allows tutors to involve students in a dialogue which helps to get in touch with their knowledge and find their unique voices. Collaborative environment rejects any kinds of hierarchies in the writing centers, thus allowing to negotiate and set common goals. Writing center is an institutional response to the writers&#x27; needs to have a good listener and editor, someone who knows how to write and can ask questions about the writing which writers would not ask themselves.

== Variations==
No longer strictly an American phenomenon, writing centers have spread in other world regions as well. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW) is in part concerned with the study and advancement of writing centers in European universities. The International Writing Centers Association offers support for writing centers from around the world, with current regional associations in Europe and proposed associations in the Middle East, South Africa, and the Far East.

Writing centers are not exclusively a post-secondary phenomenon. Some high schools have successfully created writing centers similar to the model in higher education. Some writing centers provide services for the non-academic community, such as peer-tutoring for out-of-school writers and workshops on a wide variety of topics. Some even have sites off-campus entirely, where they are sometimes identified as community writing centers.

Writing centers are now being used in the business world. Notably, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve added a writing center.

<text>Onofre Agustín Marimón (19 December 1923 – 31 July 1954) was an Argentine racing driver, who competed in Formula One at 12 Grands Prix between and . 

Marimón participated in 12 Formula One Grands Prix, achieving two podiums at the 1953 Belgian and 1954 British Grands Prix, and scoring a total of 8 championship points with Maserati. He also won the non-championship 1954 Rome Grand Prix, driving the Maserati 250F.

During practice for the 1954 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Marimón died after losing control of his Maserati 250F, impacting a ditch and causing a rollover. He was the first fatality at a Formula One Grand Prix.

==Biography==
Onofre Agustín Marimón was born on 19 December 1923 in Zárate, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Marimón was the son of racing driver and undertaker Domingo Marimón, the winner of the 1948 South American Grand Prix for Turismo Carretera. Marimón Sr. and Juan Manuel Fangio were team-mates for Chevrolet and friends, leading to Fangio becoming a mentor for Marimón Jr. when the young Zárateño moved to Europe.

Marimón was killed on 31 July 1954 during practice for the 1954 German Grand Prix, becoming the first driver to be fatally injured at a World Championship Grand Prix other than the Indianapolis 500. His Maserati left the Nürburgring race course at the Breidscheid curve near the Adenauer Bridge after he lost control attempting to improve his qualifying time. He died at the bottom of a steep and treacherous incline. He was going fast on a downgrade but failed to negotiate a sharp turn at the bottom. Marimón impacted a ditch, his Maserati shearing off a tree and rolling over a number of times. He was pinned underneath the car as it came to rest on its top with the wheels spinning in the air. Marimón was given the last rites by a Catholic priest before dying a few minutes after rescue workers freed him. It was thought that his braking unit failed.

Marimón&#x27;s death trimmed the Maserati team to four drivers. His practice times had not been satisfactory enough for him to make the top 5 for the
1954 German Grand Prix. His best time was 21.3 seconds behind the record time of 9:50.1 set by Fangio.

<doc id="1235784" wikidata="Q173328" url="?curid=1235784" title="Paul Frère">
<text>Paul Frère (; 30 January 1917 – 23 February 2008) was a racing driver and journalist from Belgium. He participated in eleven World Championship Formula One Grands Prix debuting on 22 June 1952 and achieving one podium finish with a total of eleven championship points. He drove in several non-Championship Formula One races, winning the 1952 Grand Prix des Frontières and 1960 VI South African Grand Prix.

He also won the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving for Ferrari with fellow Belgian teammate Olivier Gendebien.

== Life ==
Frère was born at Le Havre in 1917.

He drove for the Ferrari works team, with Peter Collins.

After retiring from active racing in 1960, he worked as an automotive journalist based in Europe (he was the European Editor for &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine). He had numerous acquaintances amongst vehicle design engineers, especially in Japan at Honda and Mazda and also worked as a consultant to automobile manufacturers. He also had the opportunity to test numerous road and racing cars as a journalist, one of the highlights being the Audi R8 which he tested and demonstrated during a break in the proceedings of the Test Day of the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the time he was 86 years old, making him the oldest racing driver to drive a then-current sportscar.

Frère, along with Piero Taruffi and Denis Jenkinson, was one of the first writers to treat motor racing as a skill that could be analyzed, explained, and taught. His 1963 book, &quot;Sports Car and Competition Driving&quot; is still a standard reference in the field. It influenced the development of competition driving schools, such as those founded by Jim Russell, Bob Bondurant and many others.

Frère was an expert on Porsche cars, in particular the Porsche 911, writing the definitive book on this series, &quot;The Porsche 911 Story&quot;. He maintained a close relationship with Porsche over the years. He was also considered an advisor and expert on the 911 by Alois Ruf, a respected Porsche tuner and manufacturer as head of Ruf Automobile, who consulted Frère during the development of Ruf&#x27;s RGT8 Model.

In 1967, Frère had a cameo appearance in &quot;The Departure&quot;, a Belgian film about a car-obsessed young man trying to get possession of a Porsche 911 for a race.

Only weeks before his 90th birthday in January 2007, he was badly injured in an accident near the Nürburgring and was hospitalized for 14 days in intensive care.

Frère died on 23 February 2008 in Saint-Paul-de-Vence (France). Turn 15 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, formerly the first part of the &quot;Stavelot&quot; corner, has been renamed in his honour.

==Rowing champion==
Frère was also a successful rower winning three Belgian championships. In 1946 and 1947 he won the national title in a coxless four. In 1946, he also won it with the coxed four.

<text>Paul Edward Goldsmith (October 2, 1925 – September 6, 2024) was an American racing driver. During his career he raced motorcycles, stock cars, and Indianapolis cars, achieving success in each discipline.

Goldsmith won the USAC Stock Car national championship in 1961 and 1962, driving a Pontiac for Ray Nichels. Earlier in his career, he was a successful motorcycle racer within the AMA circuit, capturing the Daytona 200 for Harley-Davidson in 1953. In 1958, driving a Pontiac for Smokey Yunick, Goldsmith won the final NASCAR stock car race on the Daytona Beach road course.

At the time of his death Goldsmith was the oldest living former driver to have competed in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship, as well as the oldest living veteran of the Indianapolis 500; he and A. J. Foyt were the last living competitors from the 1958 Indianapolis 500.

==Early life==
Born on October 2, 1925, in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Goldsmith relocated to Detroit, Michigan, with his family at an early age.

During the Second World War, Goldsmith served in the Merchant Marine. After the war, he worked full-time at a Chrysler plant in Detroit. He co-owned a service-station in Royal Oak, Michigan, until 1952.

==Motorcycle career==
Goldsmith began riding motorcycles soon after the end of the Second World War. His racing career began by accident in 1946, while spectating an event at Partington Pastures in Sterling Heights, Michigan. A lower number of riders appeared than had been expected, and Goldsmith was invited to participate, finishing third. He soon began competing locally every weekend.

Goldsmith would race Harley-Davidsons throughout his cycling career, possibly inspired by Leo Anthony, a Michigan-born rider at the peak of his career in 1946. During 1947, Goldsmith earned the backing of leading Detroit Harley-Davidson dealer Earl Robinson. Teaming up with Robinson&#x27;s chief mechanic, Boots Carnegie, Goldsmith campaigned throughout the county fair circuit of the Midwest. By 1948, Goldsmith had achieved Expert rating from the AMA. In March of that year, he competed in his first Daytona 200, finishing in fifth position.

In 1950, Goldsmith increasingly ran among the leaders. His first Class C podium came at Strawberry Hill Raceway, near Richmond, Virginia, where he finished third in a 10-mile race. During the year, Goldsmith scored two further podiums – third place in a 20-mile event at Bay Meadows, in San Mateo, California; and third in a 5-mile national at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. During the 1951 season, Goldsmith repeated his performance at Strawberry Hill. He later finished second at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, the best finish of his career up to that point. Goldsmith scored his third and final podium of the season in an 8-mile national at Williams Grove Speedway, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.

=== Harley–Davidson relationship, and AMA success ===
In 1952, Goldsmith competed until midway though the season before scoring his first podium of the year, a third place in the Class C National Championship event, a 25-mile race held at the Illinois State Fairgrounds. The following week, Goldsmith scored the first victory of his career, winning at the Milwaukee Mile, close to the headquarters of Harley-Davidson. In the 15-mile event, extended four extra laps due to a caution, Goldsmith beat Ernie Beckman to the flag. Two weeks later, he finished second in a 5-mile event at the Indiana State Fairgrounds. During the season Goldsmith was hired to compete directly for Harley-Davidson. Offered the new KR model, he disliked the handling, and continued competing on an older WR while working on the handling and tuning of the KR model in order to bring it up to speed.

For the opening race of the 1953 season, the Daytona 200 on the Daytona Beach road course, Goldsmith entered riding the newly-developed Harley-Davidson KR-TT road-racing variant of the KR model introduced the season before. While in Daytona Beach, Goldsmith would work on his cycles at the race shop owned by famed local racer Marshall Teague. It was on one such occasion that Goldsmith first met and began consulting famed local mechanic Henry &quot;Smokey&quot; Yunick, going on to impress him with his racing style and work ethic. Goldsmith prepared diligently for the event, fine-tuning his engine and testing repeatedly on local roads.

On March 14, starting in the second row, Goldsmith took the lead on the first lap heading into the North turn, before being passed by John Hicks on the back stretch. By the ninth lap, Goldsmith had settled into third place, behind the Triumphs of Hicks and Ed Kretz. For the duration of the event, Goldsmith would adhere to a remarkably consistent pace; his lap times for the duration of the 48-lap event on the 4.1 mile course varied by less than three seconds of one another. On the tenth lap, a serious accident occurred, which bunched up the field, allowing Kretz and Goldsmith to pass Hicks. On lap 21, shortly before the midpoint of the race, Goldsmith passed Kretz for the lead heading into the North turn. Goldsmith would run the remainder of the event unchallenged, setting a new record time of 94.45 MPH. His victory was Harley-Davidson&#x27;s first at the event since 1940.

Goldsmith followed up his victory at Daytona with a third place at the Ohio State Fairgrounds 10-mile event. At Dodge City Raceway, in Dodge City, Kansas, Goldsmith had built up a two-mile lead by the quarter mark of a 200-mile event, before running out of gas. Later in 1953, he won a 100-mile event at the grueling Langhorne Speedway cinder track. Goldsmith was voted the AMA Most Popular Rider of the Year for his efforts during the season.

During the 1954 Daytona 200, Goldsmith again took the lead on the opening lap before settling into a consistent pace, running second behind Joe Leonard. Goldsmith inherited the lead on the eighth lap, as Leonard dropped out with a mechanical issue. On the following lap, coming out of the South turn onto the beach, Goldsmith got caught up in the surf, ending his race. That season, the first in which the AMA applied a championship point system, Goldsmith took a victory in the Charity Newsies, a 10-mile national at the Ohio State Fairgrounds half mile. He also finished second at the San Mateo 20-mile event, and took third place at a 5-mile event at Portland Meadows in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith finished second on the half mile oval at the Meade County Fairgrounds&#x27; 5-mile event in Sturgis, South Dakota. Goldsmith finished the season second in the AMA National point standings, behind Leonard, his former pupil. During the season Goldsmith continually finished in points and prize-paying positions.

In 1955 Goldsmith won his final AMA event, an 8-mile competition at Illiana Speedway, in Schererville, Indiana. He was frequently racing stock cars by this time. He recorded the final national podium of his career, a third at the Milwaukee Mile 9-mile event on August 27, 1955. Goldsmith finished the season eighth in points. Sometime before the 1956 AMA season, Goldsmith signed with Yunick to race Chevrolets during the 1956 NASCAR Grand National season. Goldsmith would soon leave motorcycle competition, pressured to run only stock cars by General Motors.

Goldsmith&#x27;s final event of his motorcycle career was the 1956 Daytona 200. Goldsmith recalled afterwards that, &quot;Ed Cole was on my fanny pretty good for riding. He told me I shouldn&#x27;t be riding the bikes but driving full time for Chevy.&quot; Goldsmith said he &quot;hated&quot; giving up motorcycle racing, but made the decision because auto-racing was &quot;much bigger than Harley-Davidson.&quot;

==Stock car career==
Goldsmith first began racing automobiles in 1950, competing in regional events. He experienced quick success, winning his first ever event driving a modified Ford roadster, in a race in Detroit. Later, he won a 250-mile stock car event held during the 1953 Michigan State Fair. After initially being scored in second place, a later review of the scoring tape revealed Goldsmith the true winner. Goldsmith competed in his first top-level automobile race during 1954, a AAA Stock Car national championship race at the Milwaukee Mile. Starting 22nd in a field of 38, Goldsmith finished in 21st.

=== Early NASCAR career (1956–1958) ===
During the 1956 Daytona Speedweeks, Goldsmith was competing in that year&#x27;s Daytona 200 when he interacted with Yunick. Goldsmith had previously impressed Yunick by acing an improvised series of tests developed by Yunick. Yunick would offer prospective drivers a bit of candy from a snake nut can. Yunick later wrote in his autobiography, &quot;[Goldsmith] caught the son-of-a-bitch snake coming out of the can. I&#x27;ve never seen anybody else that could catch it, even knowing what was going on.&quot; Yunick then asked Goldsmith to drive him around a race course set up on the Titusville-Cocoa Airport, located south of Daytona Beach. By Yunick&#x27;s recollection, Goldsmith&#x27;s performance lapping the course, as well as in a third test designed to gauge reflexes under braking, exceeded that of the previous record holders of Yunick&#x27;s tests.

Yunick offered Goldsmith a ride driving his Chevrolet on the NASCAR Grand National circuit. Goldsmith&#x27;s first appearance came on March 25 at Lakewood Speedway. Starting seventh, Goldsmith was involved in an accident on the 36th lap, ending the race 23rd. During the Southern 500 that year, Goldsmith started and finished the race in the top 5. The next event at Langhorne saw Goldsmith considered a dark horse, due to his strong performance at Darlington, and his previous motorcycling experience at Langhorne. Starting on the outside of the front row, Goldsmith dominated the 300 mile event. Leading 182 of 300 laps, Goldsmith beat runner-up Lee Petty by a seven-lap margin. In addition to his victory, Goldsmith recorded 3 other top 5 finishes in 9 races during 1956.

After continuing with Chevrolet for the first few rounds of the 1957 season, Yunick switched to Ford following the Daytona Beach race. Competing with them for the first several months of the season, their factory-backing was cut off after the Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) instituted a ban on factory programs in June, in response to increasing public concern over highway safety. During the 1957 Southern 500 held on September 2 at Darlington Raceway, which he had been favored by many to win, Goldsmith sustained serious injuries in an accident which also seriously injured Fonty Flock and killed Bobby Myers. Running for Yunick and occasionally Pete DePaolo, Goldsmith would finish the season with 4 wins and 6 other top 5 finishes in 25 events that season. Most notable was the Raleigh 250, run on July 4.

In 1958, Goldsmith was the winner of the final Grand National race at the famous Daytona Beach Road Course. His victory would make him the only racer to win the Daytona Beach road course both in a stock car and on a motorcycle. Driving a Pontiac in the event, he led the race from start to finish. A few weeks later, Goldsmith quit the NASCAR circuit, motivated by a desire to race in the Indianapolis 500, sanctioned by the United States Auto Club (USAC).

=== Association with Ray Nichels ===
Goldsmith&#x27;s win at Daytona had attracted the attention of Semon Knudsen, the general manager of GM&#x27;s Pontiac division. Knudsen, seeking to change Pontiac&#x27;s stodgy image with the public, had recently hired Ray Nichels, until recently an Indianapolis car mechanic, to begin building Pontiac into a performance brand. That fall, Knudsen arranged a meeting between Nichels and Goldsmith, after which the latter was hired to be Nichels&#x27; Pontiac development driver.

Working well together, Nichels soon hired Goldsmith directly, where he replaced Pat O&#x27;Connor as Nichels&#x27; Firestone test driver. Goldsmith would begin putting in thousands of miles of testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Southwestern track. For most of 1958 and 1959, Goldsmith&#x27;s commitment to break into the Indianapolis establishment, and later his business commitments with Nichels meant he had little time for a robust racing schedule, competing in only a handful of Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) sanctioned stock car events in the Midwest.

=== USAC career (1960–1965) ===

==== 1960 ====
Goldsmith returned to racing in 1960, competing on the USAC circuit. While he recorded 4 poles, and finished near the front with regularity, he did not reach victory lane until the final race of the season, in Dayton. Taking the lead from Don White on the opening lap, Goldsmith dominated the event, leading from flag to flag, and only briefly being challenged by Tony Bettenhausen. Goldsmith earned a significant bonus for laps lead during the event, which took place on his 33rd birthday. The conclusion of the season saw Goldsmith and Nichels finish second in points, a significant margin behind the champion, Norm Nelson. In addition to his earnings from the Indianapolis 500, Goldsmith&#x27;s prize money accrued during the Stock Car season saw him finish sixth overall among earners of all USAC-sanctioned series.

==== 1961 ====
Goldsmith opened the 1961 season with a victory in the Jimmy Bryan Memorial, held in Phoenix. Starting on the pole, Goldsmith was challenged by Rodger Ward during the early stages, before taking the lead for good on the 21st lap. In DuQuoin, Goldsmith, again on pole, dueled again with Ward, before taking the lead for good on the 63rd lap as Ward bobbled. At the 250-mile event at the Milwaukee Mile on September 17, the most prestigious event of the season, Goldsmith had a difficult race. Dropping out on lap 60, he took over teammate Len Sutton&#x27;s car, only to drop out again on lap 130. Taking over the year-old Pontiac of Whitey Johnson, Goldsmith was able to fight to a leader lap finish of 5th place. In the final race of the season, at Trenton, Goldsmith came from behind to win the race as well as the championship, edging out Nelson, who finished fourth, for the title. Goldsmith won the 1961 USAC Stock Car national championship, with 7 poles, 10 wins, 16 top-five finishes in 19 races.

==== 1962 ====
Goldsmith again started strong for 1962. In a two-heat event at Riverside to open the season, Dan Gurney was disqualified from the first for lightening of his car. Goldsmith won the second heat over Gurney, as was declared the overall winner. Goldsmith&#x27;s won his second consecutive road-course event, the Peterborough Invitational Trophy at Circuit Mont-Tremblant, in Canada. The 250-mile event consisted again of two heats. The combined highest average time of the two heats determined the winner. Goldsmith finished second behind Ward in the first heat, and beat Ward in the second. His combined time was two-seconds faster. He won the USAC championship in 1962 with 6 poles, 8 wins, and 15 top-five finishes in 20 races.

==== 1963 ====
Goldsmith and Nichels did not record as much success during the 1963 season, which saw Nichels Engineering transition from Pontiac to Plymouth factory support. Although they recorded three wins during the season, they also skipped several events, and suffered numerous mechanical DNFs. The end of the season saw Goldsmith seemingly ranked ninth in the points standings.

==== Suspension from USAC ====
While a USAC regular, Goldsmith and Nichels occasionally participated in NASCAR-sanctioned events. Due to compete in the 1963 NASCAR season-ending Golden State 400 at Riverside on November 6, USAC informed Goldsmith&#x27;s team at the end of October that USAC would not permit their drivers to participate in the event, despite it having an FIA-affiliation. This effective ban lead to all USAC drivers, except Goldsmith, to withdraw. Goldsmith, who later claimed never to have been notified directly by USAC, declared that as an employee of his team and Plymouth, he intended to uphold his obligation to compete.

Goldsmith did not participate in the original day of qualifying, instead setting his time during a last chance session on November 3. His time broke the recent track record set by Dan Gurney during the main qualifying session held on October 31. Despite being the quickest of all drivers, Goldsmith was forced to start from the middle of the field. Gurney, along with fellow USAC drivers A. J. Foyt, Parnelli Jones, Roger Penske, and Rodger Ward did not compete in the event. During the race, Goldsmith was taken out on the 42nd lap after being hit by Bob Bondurant.

The day following the race, Henry Banks, USAC official and a former driver, announced that Goldsmith had been suspended by USAC for a period of one year, and stripped him of his points earned during 1963. Goldsmith threatened to relocate to Mexico, which he claimed would allow him to compete as an FIA-licensed foreign driver. USAC responded by affirming that such an action would lead to no change in Goldsmith&#x27;s status. Goldsmith and Nichels were soon rumored to compete in NASCAR during the 1964 Grand National season.

==== 1965 ====
Although Goldsmith&#x27;s USAC suspension had expired in November of 1964, it was March 23 1965, before Goldsmith returned to Indianapolis for reinstatement, receiving his driver&#x27;s card directly from Banks. Goldsmith and Nichels returned to the USAC Stock Car circuit for the second race of the season – the Yankee 300 at the Indianapolis Raceway Park (IRP) road course – edging out Parnelli Jones for pole position. Goldsmith fell to 15th place during the opening lap, after going off-course at the first turn. He finished in second behind he winner, Norm Nelson. At the IRP oval two races later, Goldsmith won over Nelson, driving the 150-mile event without pitting. Goldsmith won three more races heading into the final race of the season, but lost the championship to Norm Nelson during the final event of the season.

==Championship Car career==
Goldsmith competed in 8 races in the USAC Championship Car series, between 1958 and 1963 with 6 of those starts in the Indianapolis 500. He finished in the top five twice at Indianapolis, following up a 5th-place finish in 1959 with a 3rd in 1960.

== World Drivers&#x27; Championship career ==
The AAA/USAC-sanctioned Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indianapolis during those years were credited with World Drivers&#x27; Championship participation, and were eligible to score WDC points alongside those which they may have scored towards the AAA/USAC National Championship.

Goldsmith participated in three World Drivers&#x27; Championship races at Indianapolis. He finished in the top three once, and scored six World Drivers&#x27; Championship points.

==Personal life==
During his racing career Goldsmith became one of the first drivers to become a pilot, often flying to and from races. After his retirement from driving, flying primarily a Cessna 421, he transported engines and parts to and from races.

For several decades following racing, Goldsmith owned a series of ranches and restaurants.

He remained an active pilot and worker, and was the owner-operator of the Griffith-Merrillville Airport in Griffith, Indiana.

Goldsmith died in Munster, Indiana, on September 6, 2024, at the age of 98.

== Awards and honors ==
Goldsmith has been inducted into the following halls of fame:

<doc id="1235790" wikidata="Q693096" url="?curid=1235790" title="Fort Orange (New Netherland)">
<text>Fort Orange () was the first permanent Dutch settlement in New Netherland; the present-day city and state capital Albany, New York developed near this site. It was built in 1624 as a replacement for Fort Nassau, which had been built on nearby Castle Island and served as a trading post until 1617 or 1618, when it was abandoned due to frequent flooding. Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau. Due to a dispute between the Director-General of New Netherland and the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck regarding jurisdiction over the fort and the surrounding community, the fort and community became an independent municipality, paving the way for the future city of Albany. After the English reconquered the region they soon abandoned Fort Orange (renamed Fort Albany) in favor of a new fort: Fort Frederick, constructed in 1676.

==History==
In 1624, a ship with 30 Protestant Walloons (people from what is today southern Belgium) landed in New Netherland; 18 of the men were sent to the location near present-day Albany. Under direction of the Dutch, they built Fort Orange roughly north of Fort Nassau, which was prone to flooding, and about five miles south of the confluence of the Mohawk River and the North River.

The Walloons were later recalled south to settle New Amsterdam. A 1628 publication on the population of New Netherland stated that &quot;there are no families at Fort Orange ... they keep five or six and twenty (25 or 26) persons, traders, there&quot;.  In 1626, the commander of Fort Orange and a company of men set out from the fort to assist the Mohican people in their war against the Mohawk, the powerful Iroquois tribe based in the Mohawk Valley to the west of the fort. The Dutch party was ambushed and three men were killed approximately a mile from the fort, roughly where Lincoln Park and Delaware Avenue are sited today.

Whereas later settlement would be through the purchase of land from the Native Americans, the Dutch built Fort Orange without any consent. They continued to hold it only through the goodwill of the Mahican, and the occasional presents that they gave to the local Mahicans.

When the Dutch established the Charter of Privileges and Exemptions in 1629 setting up the patroon system, Kiliaen van Rensselaer established his patroonship of Rensselaerswyck, surrounding Fort Orange on of shoreline along the Hudson River and inland on each side of the fort. This land patent was interpreted by van Rensselaer as including Fort Orange and the settlement that had begun outside its walls. He began purchasing and acquiring title to the lands from the Mahican.

In 1630, Gillis Hoosett purchased in van Rensselaer&#x27;s name the lands to the south and north of the fort from the natives. Later in 1630 the first permanent Dutch settlers and farmers came to Fort Orange and settled on the outskirts of the fort; their village was first called the Fuyck and later Beverwyck. In 1634 the commander of Fort Orange ordered Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert west into the Mohawk Valley and Indian country, for the purpose of understanding why the fur trade had declined. The trip lasted six weeks and took Bogaert and his men through a number of Mohawk villages and into Oneida villages, at least 100 miles from the fort. This journey was recorded in van den Bogaert&#x27;s daily journal which is titled, A Journey into Mohawk and Oneida Country. In the 1640s a French Jesuit priest and missionary, Isaac Jogues, described Fort Orange as &quot;a wretched little fort ... built of stakes, with four or five pieces of cannon of Breteuil&quot;.

In 1648, dispute arose between agents of the Dutch West India Company and agents of the patroon over control of Fort Orange and the surrounding settlement. The Director-General of New Netherland, representing the West India Company, was Pieter Stuyvesant, who saw the patroon&#x27;s position, power, and land as a direct threat to the West India Company&#x27;s ability to profit from the beaver pelt trade in Fort Orange. Several confrontations arose over the status of the fort and the rights of settlers around it. Stuyvesant at first ordered all buildings within cannon shot of the fort to be destroyed, then lowered that circumference to that of musket shot. In response, the patroon&#x27;s agent, Commander van Schlechtenhorst, decided to expand settlement to &quot;within pistol shot of Fort Orange&quot;.

After the yearly freshets had damaged much of the fort, the West India Company decided to reconstruct the fort using stone. In response, van Schlechtenhorst declared it illegal for anyone to quarry stone within Rensselaerswyck for the fort or for anyone to sell the material to the fort&#x27;s commander, Carl van Brugge. All material for the fort had to be shipped in from outside the colony. Van Schlechtenhorst claimed that Fort Orange had been illegally built on the patroon&#x27;s lands, while Stuyvesant noted that Fort Orange had been built 15 years prior to the establishment of Rensselaerswyck.

In 1651, Stuyvesant declared the jurisdiction of the fort to extend 600 paces around the fort, thereby severing it from Rensselaerswyck; he appointed Johannes Dyckman as commissary of Fort Orange. In 1652, Stuyvesant, to settle this dispute once and for all, set up a &quot;Court of Justice for the Village of Beverwyck and its dependencies&quot;, the first municipal government for the future city of Albany.

At the time when Beverwyck consisted of roughly 100 structures huddled next to the fort, Stuyvesant set up Beverwyck at a safer distance from the cannons of the fort and laid out future Albany&#x27;s oldest streets – State Street and Broadway.

By the end of the 1650s, the fort was in disrepair again, and both Fort Orange and Beverwyck were enclosed by a wooden stockade in 1660.

In 1663, smallpox raged in Fort Orange, killing one person a day, which was a large percentage given the small population in the fort. On September 8, 1664, the English, after sending numerous war ships to New Amsterdam, demanded the surrender of New Netherland and came to terms with the Dutch. On that date New Netherland became the Province of New York with Colonel Richard Nicolls appointed as the first English colonial governor; New Amsterdam was renamed New York. Johannes De Decker sailed on that day from New Amsterdam to Fort Orange to rally the troops and settlers to resist English rule. On September 10, Governor Nicholls sent troops to demand the peaceful surrender of the &quot;Fort Aurania&quot;, &quot;aurania&quot; being the Latin name for &quot;orange&quot; that the English used when referring to Fort Orange.

It was not until September 24, 1664, that vice-director of New Netherland Johannes de Montagne surrendered the fort to the English, and Colonel George Cartwright took command. On the 25th, Captain John Manning was given control of the fort, which was renamed Fort Albany; Beverwyck was named Albany.

In 1673 the Dutch retook New York City, which they named New Orange, on July 29, then retook Albany on August 3. In September, Albany was renamed Willemstadt and Fort Albany became Fort Nassau. The Treaty of Westminster, signed on February 19, 1674, renamed New Orange and Willemstadt back to their English names; Fort Nassau became Fort Albany and Willemstadt became Albany.

In 1666, Jeremias van Rensselaer, then-patroon of Rensselaerswyck, had petitioned the new government of Governor Nicholls to recognize Fort Albany (Fort Orange) as part of Rensselaerswyck. Governor Nicholls informed him that he would be wise to drop the matter until he heard from the Duke of York. In 1678, Governor Andros issued to the patroon&#x27;s heirs a grant reaffirming the patroon&#x27;s rights over Rensselaerswyck, but leaving out Fort Albany and the immediate area around the fort.

The English abandoned Fort Orange and built a new fort on top of State Street Hill named Fort Frederick; it served both to defend the settlement from the Mohawk and other Iroquois to the west and to be on high ground to remind the Dutch inhabitants of English rule. The land around the old fort was sold to the Dutch Reformed Church for use as pastureland, but the fort structure continued to deteriorate. It was indicated on maps during the 18th century, labeled as &quot;ruins of an Old Fort.&quot; Richard Smith, a traveler, observed by 1769 that there was &quot;nothing to be seen of Fort Orange... but the Ditch which surrounded it&quot;. After the American Revolutionary War, the deteriorated site of the old fort was memorialized as a historic site and was the site of many historical observances.

===Subsequent occupation===
Simeon De Witt built a large house or mansion and a number of outbuildings on the site of the old Dutch fort during the 1790s; the address for the site of the old fort became 549 South Market Street (later Broadway). On his property traces of the old fort could still be seen as late as 1812. He lived at this location while he was the surveyor-general of New York. Following his death, his mansion and outbuildings were adapted for use as the Fort Orange Hotel. It burned down in 1848 but was rebuilt in a second structure under the same name.

In 1886, as part of the bicentennial of Albany&#x27;s incorporating document, the &quot;Dongan Charter&quot;, the city erected a bronze metal engraved tablet at the site of the northeastern bastion of Fort Orange. In the 1930s the tablet was moved during construction of the first of two Dunn Memorial Bridges (named for Private Parker F. Dunn (1890–1918, a local veteran / soldier of the United States Army, killed on the Western Front in northern France, during the First World War (1914/1917–1918), and awarded the congressional Medal of Honor, the current second / replacement span built in 1969. It carries U.S. Route 9 and U.S. Route 20 highways across the upper Hudson River, between Albany on the west to Rensselaer, New York in the east.

For almost 100 years, the original installation site of the plaque did not mark the true accurate site of the colonial era Dutch military post of Fort Orange. The Albany Institute of History and Art has a cannonball labeled as &quot;Dug up at Fort Orange site July 22nd 1886&quot;, the date / year that the bicentennial marker was placed. No known accurate historical research or archeological excavations digging were done back then in the 1880s, other than simply placing the bronze historical marker. The tablet was moved again in 1971 after the 1970–71 archeologist historical excavations discovered remnants of the Dutch fort which were prompted during the construction project for nearby larger / modern Interstate 787 and the highway interchange with the South Mall Expressway. The marker was returned to the actual verified site of historic Fort Orange, but not to the former location of the northeastern bastion.

As the Fort Orange Archeological Site, the area of the fort was declared a National Historic Landmark (and added to the lists of the National Register of Historic Places) on November 4, 1993, (maintained by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior).

==Archeological historical excavations (1970–1971)==

Prior to the 1970 excavations, no 17th century Dutch colonial era artifacts had been discovered in Albany. The excavations were undertaken by the New York State Historic Trust with the cooperation of the New York State Department of Transportation from October 20, 1970, until March 1971. The first test hole was made in what had been the cellar of the De Witt house, which had obliterated all remnants of the old fort. Digging at a site under Broadway in front of the house turned up many pieces from the Dutch colonial past. Among those were a Jew&#x27;s harp, tobacco pipes, beads, Rhenish stoneware, and Delftware. The excavations also revealed the former south moat and counterscarp, a pebbled path from the east entrance of the fort, a brewery owned by Jean Labatie built in 1647, and parts of several houses owned by Hendrick Andriessen van Doesburgh, Abraham Staats, and Hans Vos.

From the excavations, scholars noted that venison (deer meat) made up the majority of the meat eaten by the settlers and soldiers of the fort, followed by pork. The greatest number of fish bones and scales were found in a pit south of the pebbled entrance path dating from before 1648. Sturgeon were found infrequently in later 17th-century deposits. Eating and drinking utensils consisted of lead-glazed red-bodied and white/buff bodied earthenware, tin earthenware, Rhenish German stoneware, Chinese Empire porcelain, glass roemers, Spechter glasses, and &quot;façon de Venise&quot; glassware. The tin-glazed earthenware, at least prior to 1650, were of the majolica variety and not delftware. Porcelain was rare, found only as a few shards.
The remains of many clay pipes were found, often with the &quot;EB&quot; maker&#x27;s mark of Eduard Bird (c. 1610–65) of Amsterdam.
The site was in continual use and artifacts recovered include 1830s creamware or pearlware and 1860s copper bottom coffee pot remnants. The artifacts from the excavation are housed and occasionally exhibited at the New York State Museum in Albany.

<text>Salim Kechiouche (born 2 April 1979) is a French actor.

== Early life ==
Kechiouche was born to Algerian parents in Lyon, France. At the age of 15, he was discovered by French actor and director Gaël Morel. Morel gave him his first role in a feature film, &quot;À Toute Vitesse&quot; (&quot;Full Speed&quot;), released in 1996. Kechiouche has acted in most of Morel&#x27;s works, including &quot;Premières Neiges&quot; in 1999, &quot;3 Dancing Slaves (Le Clan)&quot; in 2004 and &quot;After Him (Après lui)&quot; in 2007. He entered acting school and graduated in 2002.

Kechiouche now lives in Paris, dividing his time between cinema and the stage.

==Career ==
=== Film and stage ===
In addition to Morel, Kechiouche has worked with other French directors such as François Ozon, as well as with non-French directors.

In 2003, Kechiouche played the role of Karim in &quot;Gigolo&quot;, directed by German director Bastian Schweitzer, opposite Amanda Lear. Kechiouche played a self-destructive gigolo trying to get his life back on track in the jet-set world of Paris. The film was nominated for a Golden Bear Award in the Best Short Film category at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival.

His movies include &quot;Grande École&quot; (2004), playing Mécir, and &quot;Le Clan&quot; (2004), released as &quot;Three Dancing Slaves&quot; in the U.S..

<text>CSS George Page, a 410-ton sidewheel steamship, was originally built as a transport at Washington, D.C. in 1853.

She was attached to the Quartermaster&#x27;s Department of the United States Army, until captured by the Confederates at nearby Aquia Creek, Virginia in May 1861, when she became a part of the Virginia Navy. In June 1861 Virginia transferred her vessels to the Confederate States Navy and &quot;George Page&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Charles Carroll Simms, CSN, was fitted out for river defense service, and sometime later renamed &quot;City of Richmond&quot;. Her upper works may have been removed at this time.

She operated in the Potomac River in the vicinity of Quantico Creek. On July 7, 1861, she was damaged by gunfire from USS &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. &quot;George Page&quot; was destroyed by her crew upon abandonment of the Evansport batteries on March 9, 1862.

<text>Samuel Woodworth (January 13, 1784 – December 9, 1842) was an American author, literary journalist, playwright, librettist, and poet. He is best remembered for the poem &quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot; (1817), but he is also the first American to write a historical novel.

==Life==
Woodworth was born in Scituate, Massachusetts, to Revolutionary War veteran Benjamin Woodworth and his wife Abigail Bryant. He was apprenticed to Benjamin Russell, editor of the &quot;Columbian Sentinel&quot;. He then moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he briefly published the &quot;Belles-Lettres Repository&quot;, a weekly. He next moved to New York City, but recalled New Haven in his &quot;A Poem: New Haven&quot;.

Woodworth married Lydia Reeder in New York City on September 23, 1810. They had ten children between 1811 and 1829. Woodworth remained in New York for the rest of his life, dying there on December 9, 1842.

Woodworth&#x27;s son, Selim E. Woodworth, was a U.S. Navy officer who took part in the rescue of the snowbound Donner Party in California. The USS &quot;Woodworth&quot; (DD-460) was named for him.

==&quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot;==

Woodworth is best known for the poem &quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot; (1817). The first stanza reads:

In 1826 the poem was set to music by George Kiallmark and by the early 20th Century it became one of America&#x27;s most popular songs. It was recorded in 1899 by The Haydn Quartet, a famous barbershop quartet, and was released on Berliner Gramophone.

===The Old Oaken Bucket House===
The Old Oaken Bucket House in Scituate, Massachusetts is on the National Register of Historic Places. A sign on the house reads: &quot;1630-1930 THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET Homestead and well made famous by Samuel Woodworth in his poem &#x27;The Old Oaken Bucket.&#x27; Homestead erected by John Northey in 1675: Poet born in Scituate January 13, 1784. Massachusetts Bay Colony Tercentenary Commission.&quot;

===The Old Oaken Bucket trophy===
The Old Oaken Bucket trophy has been awarded every year since 1925 to the winner of the Big Ten Conference college football game between Purdue University and Indiana University. Although Woodworth was not from Indiana, the trophy&#x27;s name refers to the sentiment that Hoosiers have for their home state.

<doc id="1235823" wikidata="Q3437987" url="?curid=1235823" title="Rockland, Ontario">
<text>Rockland is a bilingual community located about east of downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, part of the city of Clarence-Rockland. Rockland has a population of 13,625 (2021), making up roughly half the population of the municipality. It is home to a large part of the francophone community in Eastern Ontario along with the towns situated to the east and the Ottawa suburb of Orleans to the west.

==History==

The Clarence region began growing in 1840 with the development of the road to l&#x27;Orignal-Bytown. Before then, farmers relentlessly cleared wooded space to be able to cultivate land, their only means of survival. In 1868, a young entrepreneur, William Cameron Edwards, decided to establish a sawmill at the McCaul point. The opening of a link to the Grand Trunk Railway followed in 1888 to allow wood and merchandise to be transported. Edwards, who held timber rights in the area and was also the first postmaster, named the area for the rocky nature of its landscape. The post office dates from 1869.

In 1889, the mission served by the priest Caron from Clarence-Creek became a parish. The first priest of the new parish was Siméon Hudon, native of Québec City. The first school opened in 1875 while the first high-school opened in 1905.

Construction of a second railroad in 1908 linking Ottawa and Hawkesbury greatly promoted population. In effect, for 75 cents (return) people could go to Ottawa to run errands and return in the same day. The woodmill owned by W. C. Edwards closed in 1926, as a result of the economic turmoil following the First World War. A large part of the population moved to the province of Quebec to find employment in the woodmills in Hull and Gatineau. Economic recovery began in 1939 with the start of the Second World War, and the return of soldiers after the war brought an increase in population. Construction of homes increased rapidly creating a need for expanded water services, electricity and a sewer system implemented in 1964.

Throughout the 1970s, Rockland was a small community with a population of about 3,500 people. Since the turn of the millennium, it has seen rapid growth in housing development. Prior to 2000, the number of new homes built were below 60 or 70 annually, but in the period between 2000 and 2010, the total number of new homes built was 2185.

==Leisure==
In 2008, Rockland opened a recreation centre, featuring a library, a YMCA, indoor swimming pool, and gymnasium, and theatre.

A sporting event and training center opened in Rockland in 2011, featuring ice rinks, soccer fields, a baseball diamond and a running track. It is a national training facility for Hockey Canada.

The Rockland Golf Club is located here.

Parks include Du Moulin Park, with boat ramps to the Ottawa River, and the Simon park, with a baseball field.

==Education==
There are a variety of schools in Rockland including Anglophone public, Francophone public, Anglophone Catholic, and Francophone Catholic.

===Elementary===
* Rockland Public School (RKPS)
* St. Patrick Catholic Elementary School
* École élémentaire catholique Sainte-Trinité
* École Carrefour Jeunesse

===High school===
* École secondaire catholique L&#x27;Escale
* Rockland District High School (RDHS)
* St. Francis Xavier Catholic High School (St. FX) located in Hammond but attended by many students from Rockland
* Canadian International Hockey Academy

===Adult===
* Eastern Ontario Education and Training Centre

===Music===
* Rockland Music School
* Domenic&#x27;s Academy of Music

==Transportation==

The community is served by Prescott-Russell Road 17, a two-lane road that by-passes the centre of the community to its north, though multiple businesses including big-box stores have been built along the roadway over the past several years. Heading west, it becomes Ottawa Road 174 heading towards Orleans and downtown Ottawa via Highway 417. Eastward it connects to municipalities such as Wendover, Alfred, Plantagenet and Hawkesbury. Prior to the downgrading of multiple roads across the province by the Ontario government during the 1990s, it was known as Ontario Highway 17 east of the Highway 417 and 174 split. During the past several years, there have been calls to widen Highway 174 between Trim Road and Rockland although the city of Ottawa had previously refused funding for the highway. However, some Ottawa councillors as well as the federal government have expressed support for the widen due to safety reasons and multiple fatal crashes.

The community was also served by a commuter bus line operated by Leduc Bus Lines which offered 10–12 trips from the village to downtown Ottawa and Gatineau during rush hour. However, this service has been indefinitely suspended since 2020 citing health concerns and lack of demand.

The community of Rockland expressed wishes to establish OC Transpo connections by the end of 2015 in hopes of exchanging Ottawa city culture with the rural French community that inhabits Rockland. However, given Rockland being outside the service area of OC Transpo, this connection has yet to be established.

<text>The Gottleuba Dam is the second highest dam in Saxony, Germany. It serves as a reservoir for water supply for the town Pirna and provides flood protection, but energy production is small. The dam was built between 1965 and 1974. It is located at the northern foot of the Ore Mountains, southwest of Bad Gottleuba. It dams up the Gottleuba river.

Above the concrete dam is a lookout point. The dam is not accessible to the public. Bathing and leisure sport in the lake is not allowed, since it is for drinking water. Entry around the lake is allowed.

<doc id="1235830" wikidata="Q1502001" url="?curid=1235830" title="Kurtis Kraft">
<text>Kurtis Kraft was an American designer and builder of race cars. The company built midget cars, quartermidgets, sports cars, sprint cars, Bonneville cars, and USAC Championship cars. It was founded by Frank Kurtis when he built his own midget car chassis in the late 1930s.

Kurtis built some very low fiberglass bodied two-seaters sports cars under his own name in Glendale, California between 1949 and 1955. Ford (US) running gear was used. About 36 Kurtis Sport Cars had been made when the licence was sold to Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz who built the Muntz Jet. In 1954 and 1955, road versions of their Indianapolis racers were offered.

Kurtis Kraft created 387 midget cars, some ready to race and some without engines or otherwise incomplete. Parts for several dozen were sold also, possibly as &quot;kits.&quot; The Kurtis Kraft chassis midget car featured a smaller version of the Offenhauser motor. The National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame describes the combination as &quot;virtually unbeatable for over twenty years.&quot; Kurtis Kraft also created 120 Indianapolis 500 cars, including five winners.
Kurtis sold the midget car portion of the business to Johnny Pawl in the late 1950s, and the quarter midget business to Ralph Potter in 1962.

Frank Kurtis was the first non-driver inducted in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame (U.S.). Zeke Justice and Ed Justice of the Justice Brothers both worked at Kurtis-Kraft after World War II. Zeke Justice was the first employee at Kurtis-Kraft.

The FIA World Drivers&#x27; Championship included the Indianapolis 500 between 1950 and 1960, so many Kurtis Kraft cars are credited with competing in that championship. One Kurtis midget car was also entered in the 1959 Formula One United States Grand Prix driven by Rodger Ward. It was not designed for international-style road racing and with an undersized engine it circulated at the back of the field for 20 laps before retiring with clutch problems.
