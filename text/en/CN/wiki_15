<text>Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a family of electrokinetic separation methods performed in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels. Very often, CE refers to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), but other electrophoretic techniques including capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), capillary isotachophoresis and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) belong also to this class of methods. In CE methods, analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions under the influence of an electric field. Analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and/or partitioning into an alternate phase via non-covalent interactions. Additionally, analytes may be concentrated or &quot;focused&quot; by means of gradients in conductivity and pH.

== Instrumentation ==

The instrumentation needed to perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple. A basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system is shown in &quot;figure 1&quot;. The system&#x27;s main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, a high voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different migration times in an electropherogram. The technique is often attributed to James W. Jorgensen and Krynn DeArman Lukacs, who first demonstrated the capabilities of this technique. Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in a concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. This is achieved in either pressure or electrokinetic injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (&quot;e.g.&quot; lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.

To achieve greater sample throughput, instruments with arrays of capillaries are used to analyze many samples simultaneously. Such capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) instruments with 16 or 96 capillaries are used for medium- to high-throughput capillary DNA sequencing, and the inlet ends of the capillaries are arrayed spatially to accept samples directly from SBS-standard footprint 96-well plates. Certain aspects of the instrumentation (such as detection) are necessarily more complex than for a single-capillary system, but the fundamental principles of design and operation are similar to those shown in Figure 1.

==Detection==
Separation by capillary electrophoresis can be detected by several detection devices. The majority of commercial systems use UV or UV-Vis absorbance as their primary mode of detection. In these systems, a section of the capillary itself is used as the detection cell. The use of on-tube detection enables detection of separated analytes with no loss of resolution. In general, capillaries used in capillary electrophoresis are coated with a polymer (frequently polyimide or Teflon) for increased flexibility. The portion of the capillary used for UV detection, however, must be optically transparent. For polyimide-coated capillaries, a segment of the coating is typically burned or scraped off to provide a bare window several millimeters long. This bare section of capillary can break easily, and capillaries with transparent coatings are available to increase the stability of the cell window. The path length of the detection cell in capillary electrophoresis (~ 50 micrometers) is far less than that of a traditional UV cell (~ 1 cm). According to the Beer-Lambert law, the sensitivity of the detector is proportional to the path length of the cell. To improve the sensitivity, the path length can be increased, though this results in a loss of resolution. The capillary tube itself can be expanded at the detection point, creating a &quot;bubble cell&quot; with a longer path length or additional tubing can be added at the detection point as shown in &quot;figure 2&quot;. Both of these methods, however, will decrease the resolution of the separation. This decrease is almost unnoticeable if a smooth aneurysm is produced in the wall of a capillary by heating and pressurization, as plug flow can be preserved. This invention by Gary Gordon, US Patent 5061361, typically triples the absorbance path length. When used with a UV absorbance detector, the wider cross-section of the analyte in the cell allows for an illuminating beam twice as large, which reduces shot noise by a factor of two. Together these two factors increase the sensitivity of Agilent Technologies&#x27;s Bubble Cell CE Detector six times over that of one using a straight capillary. This cell and its manufacture are described on page 62 of the June 1995 issue of the &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;.

Fluorescence detection can also be used in capillary electrophoresis for samples that naturally fluoresce or are chemically modified to contain fluorescent tags. This mode of detection offers high sensitivity and improved selectivity for these samples, but cannot be utilized for samples that do not fluoresce. Numerous labeling strategies are used to create fluorescent derivatives or conjugates of non-fluorescent molecules, including proteins and DNA. The set-up for fluorescence detection in a capillary electrophoresis system can be complicated. The method requires that the light beam be focused on the capillary, which can be difficult for many light sources. Laser-induced fluorescence has been used in CE systems with detection limits as low as 10−18 to 10−21 mol. The sensitivity of the technique is attributed to the high intensity of the light and the ability to accurately focus the light on the capillary. Multi-color fluorescence detection can be achieved by including multiple dichroic mirrors and bandpass filters to separate the fluorescence emission amongst multiple detectors (&quot;e.g.,&quot; photomultiplier tubes), or by using a prism or grating to project spectrally resolved fluorescence emission onto a position-sensitive detector such as a CCD array. CE systems with 4- and 5-color LIF detection systems are used routinely for capillary DNA sequencing and genotyping (&quot;DNA fingerprinting&quot;) applications.

In order to obtain the identity of sample components, capillary electrophoresis can be directly coupled with mass spectrometers or surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In most systems, the capillary outlet is introduced into an ion source that utilizes electrospray ionization (ESI). The resulting ions are then analyzed by the mass spectrometer. This setup requires volatile buffer solutions, which will affect the range of separation modes that can be employed and the degree of resolution that can be achieved.
The measurement and analysis are mostly done with a specialized.

For CE-SERS, capillary electrophoresis eluants can be deposited onto a SERS-active substrate. Analyte retention times can be translated into spatial distance by moving the SERS-active substrate at a constant rate during capillary electrophoresis. This allows the subsequent spectroscopic technique to be applied to specific eluants for identification with high sensitivity. SERS-active substrates can be chosen that do not interfere with the spectrum of the analytes.

== Modes of separation ==
The separation of compounds by capillary electrophoresis is dependent on the differential migration of analytes in an applied electric field. The electrophoretic migration velocity (formula_1) of an analyte toward the electrode of opposite charge is:
formula_2

The electrophoretic mobility can be determined experimentally from the migration time and the field strength:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the distance from the inlet to the detection point, formula_5 is the time required for the analyte to reach the detection point (migration time), formula_6 is the applied voltage (field strength), and formula_7 is the total length of the capillary. Since only charged ions are affected by the electric field, neutral analytes are poorly separated by capillary electrophoresis.

The velocity of migration of an analyte in capillary electrophoresis will also depend upon the rate of electroosmotic flow (EOF) of the buffer solution. In a typical system, the electroosmotic flow is directed toward the negatively charged cathode so that the buffer flows through the capillary from the source vial to the destination vial. Separated by differing electrophoretic mobilities, analytes migrate toward the electrode of opposite charge. As a result, negatively charged analytes are attracted to the positively charged anode, counter to the EOF, while positively charged analytes are attracted to the cathode, in agreement with the EOF as depicted in &quot;figure 3&quot;.

The velocity of the electroosmotic flow, formula_8 can be written as:

formula_9

where formula_10 is the electroosmotic mobility, which is defined as:

formula_11

where formula_12 is the zeta potential of the capillary wall, and formula_13 is the relative permittivity of the buffer solution. Experimentally, the electroosmotic mobility can be determined by measuring the retention time of a neutral analyte. The velocity (formula_14) of an analyte in an electric field can then be defined as:

formula_15

Since the electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution is generally greater than that of the electrophoretic mobility of the analytes, all analytes are carried along with the buffer solution toward the cathode. Even small, triply charged anions can be redirected to the cathode by the relatively powerful EOF of the buffer solution. Negatively charged analytes are retained longer in the capillary due to their conflicting electrophoretic mobilities. The order of migration seen by the detector is shown in &quot;figure 3&quot;: small multiply charged cations migrate quickly and small multiply charged anions are retained strongly.

Electroosmotic flow is observed when an electric field is applied to a solution in a capillary that has fixed charges on its interior wall. Charge is accumulated on the inner surface of a capillary when a buffer solution is placed inside the capillary. In a fused-silica capillary, silanol (Si-OH) groups attached to the interior wall of the capillary are ionized to negatively charged silanoate (Si-O−) groups at pH values greater than three. The ionization of the capillary wall can be enhanced by first running a basic solution, such as NaOH or KOH through the capillary prior to introducing the buffer solution. Attracted to the negatively charged silanoate groups, the positively charged cations of the buffer solution will form two inner layers of cations (called the diffuse double layer or the electrical double layer) on the capillary wall as shown in &quot;figure 4&quot;. The first layer is referred to as the fixed layer because it is held tightly to the silanoate groups. The outer layer, called the mobile layer, is farther from the silanoate groups. The mobile cation layer is pulled in the direction of the negatively charged cathode when an electric field is applied. Since these cations are solvated, the bulk buffer solution migrates with the mobile layer, causing the electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution. Other capillaries including Teflon capillaries also exhibit electroosmotic flow. The EOF of these capillaries is probably the result of adsorption of the electrically charged ions of the buffer onto the capillary walls. The rate of EOF is dependent on the field strength and the charge density of the capillary wall. The wall&#x27;s charge density is proportional to the pH of the buffer solution. The electroosmotic flow will increase with pH until all of the available silanols lining the wall of the capillary are fully ionized.

In certain situations where strong electroosmotic flow toward the cathode is undesirable, the inner surface of the capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the normal direction of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode). CE instrumentation typically includes power supplies with reversible polarity, allowing the same instrument to be used in &quot;normal&quot; mode (with EOF and detection near the cathodic end of the capillary) and &quot;reverse&quot; mode (with EOF suppressed or reversed, and detection near the anodic end of the capillary). One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable vinyl group (&quot;e.g.&quot; 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free radical initiator. The acrylamide is polymerized &quot;in situ&quot;, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between &quot;sticky&quot; analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.

==Efficiency and resolution==
The number of theoretical plates, or separation efficiency, in capillary electrophoresis is given by:

formula_16

where formula_17 is the number of theoretical plates, formula_18 is the apparent mobility in the separation medium and formula_19 is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. According to this equation, the efficiency of separation is only limited by diffusion and is proportional to the strength of the electric field, although practical considerations limit the strength of the electric field to several hundred volts per centimeter. Application of very high potentials (&gt;20-30 kV) may lead to arcing or breakdown of the capillary. Further, application of strong electric fields leads to resistive heating (Joule heating) of the buffer in the capillary. At sufficiently high field strengths, this heating is strong enough that radial temperature gradients can develop within the capillary. Since electrophoretic mobility of ions is generally temperature-dependent (due to both temperature-dependent ionization and solvent viscosity effects), a non-uniform temperature profile results in variation of electrophoretic mobility across the capillary, and a loss of resolution. The onset of significant Joule heating can be determined by constructing an &quot;Ohm&#x27;s Law plot&quot;, wherein the current through the capillary is measured as a function of applied potential. At low fields, the current is proportional to the applied potential (Ohm&#x27;s Law), whereas at higher fields the current deviates from the straight line as heating results in decreased resistance of the buffer. The best resolution is typically obtained at the maximum field strength for which Joule heating is insignificant (&quot;i.e.&quot; near the boundary between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the Ohm&#x27;s Law plot). Generally capillaries of smaller inner diameter support use of higher field strengths, due to improved heat dissipation and smaller thermal gradients relative to larger capillaries, but with the drawbacks of lower sensitivity in absorbance detection due to shorter path length, and greater difficulty in introducing buffer and sample into the capillary (small capillaries require greater pressure and/or longer times to force fluids through the capillary).

The efficiency of capillary electrophoresis separations is typically much higher than the efficiency of other separation techniques like HPLC. Unlike HPLC, in capillary electrophoresis there is no mass transfer between phases. In addition, the flow profile in EOF-driven systems is flat, rather than the rounded laminar flow profile characteristic of the pressure-driven flow in chromatography columns as shown in &quot;figure 5&quot;. As a result, EOF does not significantly contribute to band broadening as in pressure-driven chromatography. Capillary electrophoresis separations can have several hundred thousand theoretical plates.

The resolution (formula_20) of capillary electrophoresis separations can be written as:

formula_21

According to this equation, maximum resolution is reached when the electrophoretic and electroosmotic mobilities are similar in magnitude and opposite in sign. In addition, it can be seen that high resolution requires lower velocity and, correspondingly, increased analysis time.

Besides diffusion and Joule heating (discussed above), factors that may decrease the resolution in capillary electrophoresis from the theoretical limits in the above equation include, but are not limited to, the finite widths of the injection plug and detection window; interactions between the analyte and the capillary wall; instrumental non-idealities such as a slight difference in height of the fluid reservoirs leading to siphoning; irregularities in the electric field due to, &quot;e.g.,&quot; imperfectly cut capillary ends; depletion of buffering capacity in the reservoirs; and electrodispersion (when an analyte has higher conductivity than the background electrolyte). Identifying and minimizing the numerous sources of band broadening is key to successful method development in capillary electrophoresis, with the objective of approaching as close as possible to the ideal of diffusion-limited resolution.

==Applications==
Capillary electrophoresis may be used for the simultaneous determination of the ions NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in saliva.

One of the main applications of CE in forensic science is the development of methods for amplification and detection of DNA fragments using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which has led to rapid and dramatic advances in forensic DNA analysis. DNA separations are carried out using thin CE 50-mm fused silica capillaries filled with a sieving buffer. These capillaries have excellent capabilities to dissipate heat, permitting much higher electric field strengths to be used than slab gel electrophoresis. Therefore separations in capillaries are rapid and efficient. Additionally, the capillaries can be easily refilled and changed for efficient and automated injections. Detection occurs via fluorescence through a window etched in the capillary. Both single-capillary and capillary-array instruments are available with array systems capable of running 16 or more samples simultaneously for increased throughput.

A major use of CE by forensic biologists is typing of STR from biological samples to generate a profile from highly polymorphic genetic markers which differ between individuals. Other emerging uses for CE include the detection of specific mRNA fragments to help identify the biological fluid or tissue origin of a forensic sample.

Another application of CE in forensics is ink analysis, where the analysis of inkjet printing inks is becoming more necessary due to increasingly frequent counterfeiting of documents printed by inkjet printers. The chemical composition of inks provides very important information in cases of fraudulent documents and counterfeit banknotes. Micellar electrophoretic capillary chromatography (MECC) has been developed and applied to the analysis of inks extracted from paper. Due to its high resolving power relative to inks containing several chemically similar substances, differences between inks from the same manufacturer can also be distinguished. This makes it suitable for evaluating the origin of documents based on the chemical composition of inks. It is worth noting that because of the possible compatibility of the same cartridge with different printer models, the differentiation of inks on the basis of their MECC electrophoretic profiles is a more reliable method for the determination of the ink cartridge of origin (its producer and cartridge number) rather than the printer model of origin.

A specialized type of CE, affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE), utilizes intermolecular binding interactions to understand protein-ligand interactions. Pharmaceutical companies use ACE for a multitude of reasons, with one of the main ones being the association/binding constants for drugs and ligands or drugs and certain vehicle systems like micelles. It is a widely used technique because of its simplicity, rapid results, and low analyte usage. The use of ACE can provide specific details in binding, separation, and detection of analytes and is proven to be highly practical for studies in life sciences. Aptamer-based affinity capillary electrophoresis is utilized for the analysis and modifications of specific affinity reagents. Modified aptamers ideally exhibit and high binding affinity, specificity, and nuclease resistance. Ren et al. incorporated modified nucleotides in aptamers to introduce new confrontational features and high affinity interactions from the hydrophobic and polar interactions between IL-1α and the aptamer. Huang et al. uses ACE to investigate protein-protein interactions using aptamers. A α-thrombin binding aptamer was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein for use as a selective fluorescent probe and was studied to elucidate information on binding sites for protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has become an important, cost-effective approach to do DNA sequencing that provides high throughput and high accuracy sequencing information. Woolley and Mathies used a CE chip to sequence DNA fragments with 97% accuracy and a speed of 150 bases in 540 seconds. They used a 4-color labeling and detection format to collect fluorescent data. Fluorescence is used to view the concentrations of each part of the nucleic acid sequence, A, T, C and G, and these concentration peaks that are graphed from the detection are used to determine the sequence of the DNA.

<text>Euchloe crameri, the western dappled white, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae. 
==Description== 
Fore and hind wings pearly white on the upperside, with a black apex , mottled white. Underside of the forewings very similar, although the apex spot is greenish; in the hind wings, the greenish colour predominates, with white spots. The female is larger, with a more greenish colour, a consequence of the superposition of black and yellow scales. Very similar to &quot;Euchloe ausonia&quot;.
==Distribution and habitat== 
Widely distributed and mainly western, from Northwest Africa, Iberian Peninsula, S and SE of France, N of Italy, Ligurian Alps to Bologna. Its distribution overlaps with that of &quot;E. simplonia&quot; in E Pyrenees and SE of France . In Spain and Portugal it occurs abundantly in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the Mediterranean area. It is a very adaptable and nomadic species, so it is found in all types of habitats from 0 -2400m. In Sierra Nevada (Spain) they have been observed even above 2500 m altitude, although in these populations there is only one annual reproduction, and their density is low. The specimens of this mountainous area were described by Heinrich Ribbe, in 1905, as a differentiated subspecies, under the name of &quot;Euchloe alhambra&quot; , although it has been rejected that there are differences that justify such a presumption. Likes open, warm and dry areas, and in rural lands, preferably cultivated.
==Flight period== 
Bivoltine , reproduces twice a year, with the first brood in February, and the second between April and May. Flies until August.
==Biology== 
Oviposition is on the floral buds of various plants (&quot;Sinapis arvensis&quot; , &quot;Moricandia foleyi &quot;, &quot;Sinapis alba&quot;, &quot;Biscutella spathulata&quot;, &quot;Erucastrum naturiifolium&quot;), individually, and the caterpillar develops quickly on the leaves, soon attaining the chrysalis phase. Not all chrysalis develop into adult individuals in the first year, as some of them hibernate, remaining in that state, sometimes, up to several years; Therefore, the second generation is always partial. 

==Subspecies==
&quot;Euchloe crameri mauretanica&quot;

<doc id="1233290" wikidata="Q983329" url="?curid=1233290" title="Freddie Aguilar">
<text>Ferdinand Pascual Aguilar (; born February 5, 1953), better known as Freddie Aguilar, Ka Freddie Aguilar, or simply Ka Freddie, is a Filipino folk musician and singer-songwriter regarded as one of the pillars and icons of Original Pilipino Music (OPM). He is best known for his rendition of &quot;Bayan Ko&quot;, which became the anthem of the opposition against the regime of Ferdinand Marcos during the 1986 People Power Revolution, and for his song &quot;Anak&quot;, the best-selling Philippine music record of all time, selling 33 million copies worldwide. He is heavily associated with Pinoy rock.

He is well known internationally, claiming fame as one of the best musician-songwriters from the Philippines.

==Early life==
Aguilar began composing his own songs at age 14. Aguilar studied Electrical Engineering at De Guzman Institute of Technology but did not finish the degree program. Instead he pursued music, became a street musician, and then a folk club and bar musician. At the age of 18, Aguilar parted ways with his family and quit college; he started performing on stage at age 20. After realizing and regretting his mistakes five years after quitting college, he composed the song &quot;Anak.&quot;

===Influences===
Freddie Aguilar&#x27;s influences include British and American folk-rock stars like Cat Stevens and James Taylor. He is also heavily influenced by his Filipino heritage, nationalist feelings, and tries to constitute a musical exploration of the Filipino ethos.

==Career==
Aguilar first began performing in public in 1973, when he auditioned and was hired to play folk songs at per gig at the Hobbit House in Ermita, Manila.

===International acclaim===
Aguilar&#x27;s &quot;Anak&quot; not only broke the Philippine record charts in 1979, but it also hit the no. 1 spot in Japan and achieved considerable popularity in other countries as Angola, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and parts of Western Europe.
The song has become so famous that, by some counts, it has been recorded in as many as a hundred versions in 23 languages throughout the world. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the song was the number two world hit of the 1980s. According to Billboard, Aguilar was the second best-selling recording artist of 1981 in Europe. As of 2006, it was unsurpassed as the highest-selling record of Philippine music history.

===Political activism===
Even before Aguilar&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Bayan Ko,&quot; Aguilar created and performed songs targeted at social injustices. His album, &quot;Magdalena&quot; included songs about a girl forced into prostitution as a result of poverty and the Christian-Muslim clashes in his song &quot;Mindanao.&quot; After the album, Freddie Aguilar also sang about the injustices suffered by the powerless, poverty, and the arrogance of superpowers in a song about the U.S. and Russia.

Five years after the composition of &quot;Anak&quot;, Freddie Aguilar joined protests against the Marcos regime and began writing and performing songs that criticized the excesses of the government. Some of the songs that caused him to be banned from mainstream media include: &quot;Kata-rungan&quot; or &quot;Justice&quot; (speaking for the unjustly accused), &quot;Pangako&quot; (&quot;Promise&quot;) (a leader&#x27;s unfulfilled pledges to an abandoned people), and &quot;Luzvi-minda&quot; (an acronym for Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao, calling on Filipinos to wake up to the reality of oppression). One of the songs he was most remembered for during that time was his interpretation of &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; (&quot;My Country&quot;), in which he added a verse to the original piece.

===&quot;Bayan Ko&quot; (My Country)===
In 1978, Aguilar first recorded &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; in a patriotic effort to, in his words, &quot;jolt back those who were starting to forget who we really are.&quot; He also provided a rendition of the song as it is inspiring and gave him excitement and a surge of power. The song was originally composed in 1928 by Constancio de Guzman, with lyrics by poet Jose Corazon de Jesus, during a time of struggle for Philippine independence from US occupation. It emerged once again during the Marcos regime as the unofficial anthem of the emergent &quot;people&quot; of the &quot;People Power&quot;, the new democratic nation opposed to authoritarianism that is widely credited with the deposing of Ferdinand Marcos. In 1983, the assassination of Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino triggered massive demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship, and Aguilar&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; was blared on the radio and speakers mounted on jeepneys throughout the streets of Manila and the provinces of the Philippines. At the funeral of Senator Aquino, Freddie Aguilar sang &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; and felt that Aquino was a man of action who even gave his life for the freedom of the Philippines. During the performance, Freddie Aguilar did not feel scared anymore and felt strong and confident. He then decided to join the cause as well. Aguilar, along with APO Hiking Society and other Pinoy pop musicians who took a stand against dictatorship, joined other protest singers in music and street performances as part of the anti-Marcos rallies.

A few years later, Aguilar campaigned for the presidential candidacy of Corazon Aquino in the national election that would lead to the 1986 revolt.

Aguilar mentioned in an interview with ABS-CBN News that the lyrics of the song combines the love the Filipinos have for their country, commemorate the Aquino family, and commitment to the country. Even in this modern time, Filipinos will identify &quot;Bayan Ko&quot; as the nation&#x27;s protest anthem.

===Present day===
On January 18, 2008, Aguilar received the Asia Star Award from the Asia Model Award Festival in Korea.

Aguilar still lives in the Philippines, and continues to perform. He has moved to his own place dubbed &quot;Ka Freddie&#x27;s&quot;. He still has a strong following in the Philippines and among many Filipinos living overseas.

Aguilar has been advocating for the creation of a new department called &quot;Department of Culture and Arts.&quot; During the campaign and the Inauguration of president Rodrigo Duterte, Aguilar performed “Para sa Tunay na Pagbabago”, which is one of Duterte&#x27;s campaign jingles to the tune of Ipaglalaban Ko. Aguilar is President Duterte&#x27;s favorite singer.

Aguilar ran for senator in 2019. Though running as an independent candidate, his candidacy was endorsed by President Duterte. However, he lost, placing 30th out of 12 seats up for election.

==Personal life==
In 1978, he married Josephine Queipo and with her had 4 children: Maegan, Jonan, Isabella, and Jeriko.

On October 17, 2013, Aguilar openly admitted, in spite of the controversy that followed, that he is in a relationship with a 16-year-old girl, Jovi Gatdula Albao (Muslim name Sittie Mariam), with plans to marry and even have children, as his partner insisted that she is willing to have a baby.

On November 22, 2013, Aguilar, under Islamic rites, married his partner in Buluan, Maguindanao. Aguilar had converted to Islam six months prior to these reports, so that he could marry his then 16-year-old girlfriend. His Muslim name is Abdul Farid.

On January 3, 2018, Aguilar&#x27;s residence in North Fairview, Quezon City was destroyed by a fire, which was reported to have started at his music room. The fire destroyed most of Aguilar&#x27;s valuables estimated at , including his art collection, awards, musical instruments, records, and other personal memorabilia. Aguilar was at &quot;Ka Freddie&#x27;s&quot;, his bar &amp; restaurant along Tomas Morato Avenue, during the fire. His wife, son Jonan, and mother-in-law were all inside his residence during the fire, but were able to escape unharmed with the help of their neighbors.

<doc id="1233304" wikidata="Q333657" url="?curid=1233304" title="Communication design">
<text>Communication design is a mixed discipline between design and information-development concerned with how media communicate with people. A communication design approach is concerned with developing the message and aesthetics in media. It also creates new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Due to overlapping skills, some designers use graphic design and communication design interchangeably.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the target audience. Design skills must be used to create content suitable for different cultures and to maintain a pleasurable visual design. These are crucial pieces of a successful media communications kit.

Within the Communication discipline, the emerging framework for Communication as Design focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication affordances. Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a crowdsourcing platform, providing a model for the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform. The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of e-government applications and technologies. Interest in the Communication as Design framework continues growing among researchers.

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, and motivate people to respond to messages and to make favorable impact. This impact oriented toward the objectives of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand or move sales. It can also range from changing behaviors, to promoting a message, to disseminating information. The process of communication design involves strategic business thinking, including using market research, creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills and knowledge such as colour theory, page layout, typography, and creating visual hierarchies. Communication designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. In order to establish credibility and influence audiences through the communication, communication designers use both traditional tangible skills and the ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with visual communication, but it maintains a broader meaning that includes auditory, vocal, touch, and olfactory senses. Examples of communication design practices include information architecture, editing, typography, illustration, web design, animation, advertising, ambient media, visual identity design, performing arts, copywriting and professional writing skills applied in the creative industries.

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex digital environment around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the target audiences. Therefore, it expands its focus beyond user-experiences to user-networks. Students learn how to combine communication with art and technology. The communication design discipline involves teaching how to design web pages, video games, animation, motion graphics, and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get a customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or effectively communicate a message. Communication design students are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors, Motion graphic artists, Printmakers, and Conceptual Artists. The term communications design is fairly general considering its interdisciplinary practitioners operate within various mediums to get a message across.

===Visual communication design===

Visual communication design is the design working in any media or support of visual communication. This is considered by some to be more accurate alternative terminology to cover all types of design applied in communication. It uses a visual channel for message transmission, reflecting the visual language inherent to some media. Unlike the terms graphic design (graphics) or interface design (electronic media), it is not limited to support a particular form of content.

=== Print media design ===
Print media design is a graphic design discipline that creates designs for printed media. Print design involves the creation of flyers, brochures, book covers, t-shirt prints, business cards, booklets, bookmarks, envelope designs, signs, letterheads, posters, CD cover, print media design templates, and more. The goal of print design is to use visual graphics to communicate a specific message to viewers.

<doc id="1233311" wikidata="Q545097" url="?curid=1233311" title="Bryce DeWitt">
<text>Bryce Seligman DeWitt (born Carl Bryce Seligman; January 8, 1923 – September 23, 2004) was an American theoretical physicist noted for his work in gravitation and quantum field theory.

==Personal life==
He was born Carl Bryce Seligman, but he and his three brothers, including the noted ichthyologist, Hugh Hamilton DeWitt, added &quot;DeWitt&quot; from their mother&#x27;s side of the family, at the urging of their father, in 1950. In the early-1970s, this change of name so angered Felix Bloch that he blocked DeWitt&#x27;s appointment to Stanford University and DeWitt and his wife Cecile DeWitt-Morette, a mathematical physicist, accepted faculty positions at the University of Texas at Austin. DeWitt trained in World War II as a naval aviator, but the war ended before he saw combat.  He died September 23, 2004, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 81. He is buried in France, and was survived by his wife and four daughters.

== Academic life ==
He received his bachelor&#x27;s (&quot;summa cum laude&quot;), master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. His Ph.D. (1950) supervisor was Julian S. Schwinger, a Nobel Prize-winning american theoretical physicist, best known for his work on quantum electrodynamics (QED). Afterwards, DeWitt held a postdoctoral position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and worked at the Lawrence Livermore Lab (1952-&#x27;55). Thereafter, he held faculty positions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1956-&#x27;72) and, later, at the University of Texas at Austin (1973-2004). 

In 1957 he and his wife organized the Chapel Hill Conference.

=== Awards ===
In 1987 he was awarded the Dirac Prize, the Pomeranchuk Prize in 2002, and, posthumously, the American Physical Society&#x27;s Einstein Prize in 2005. He also was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

=== Work ===
He pioneered work in the quantization of general relativity and, in particular, developed canonical quantum gravity, manifestly covariant methods, and heat kernel algorithms. DeWitt formulated the Wheeler–DeWitt equation for the wave function of the universe with John Archibald Wheeler and advanced the formulation of Hugh Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. With his student Larry Smarr, he originated the field of numerical relativity.

<text>Kinetic typography—the technical name for &quot;moving text&quot;—is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. This text is presented over time in a manner intended to convey or evoke a particular idea or emotion.

== History ==
With the advent of film and graphic animation, the possibility of matching text and motion emerged. Examples of animated letter-forms appeared as early as 1899 in the advertising work of Georges Méliès. Early feature films contained temporal typography, but this was largely static text, presented sequentially and subjected to cinematic transitions. It was not until the 1960s that opening titles began to feature typography that was truly kinetic. Scholars recognize the first feature film to extensively use kinetic typography as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). This film&#x27;s opening title sequence—created by Saul Bass—contained animated text, featuring credits that &quot;flew&quot; in from off-screen, and finally faded out into the film itself. A similar technique was also employed by Bass in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960).

Since then, the use of kinetic typography has become commonplace in film introductory titles and television advertisements. More recently, it has been a central feature of numerous television idents, notably Martin Lambie-Nairn&#x27;s first ident for the British Channel 4 television network in use from 1982.

== Categories ==

Y. Y. Wong has proposed that it is important to distinguish between the properties of form (e.g. colour and font) and of behaviour (e.g. qualities of movement) in temporal typography. It is necessary to make this distinction in order to classify kinetic typography in ways that acknowledge their difference to static type (which may share properties of form, but not kinetic behaviours). Kinetic typography is therefore categorised according to behaviours or action, rather than appearance.

In classification, kinetic typography is a form of temporal typography (typography that is presented over time). It is distinct from other forms of temporal typography including &#x27;serial presentation&#x27;, which involves the sequential presentation of still typographic compositions.

=== Layouts ===
Barbara Brownie&#x27;s model of temporal typography divides kinetic typography into &#x27;motion typography&#x27; (subdivided into &#x27;scrolling typography&#x27;, &#x27;dynamic layout&#x27;) and &#x27;fluid typography&#x27;.

==== Motion typography ====

In dynamic layout, text elements move in relation to one another. Letters and words may move away from one another on a 2D plane, or in three-dimensional space. Likewise, scrolling typography can scroll across the flat screen, or can appear to recede or advance.
An iconic example is the &quot;Star Wars&quot; opening crawl inspired by the Flash Gordon serials.

==== Fluid typography====
In fluid typography, letterforms change and evolve without necessarily changing location.
An example is the subtitles of the international release of &quot;Night Watch&quot;:
In a scene in which a character is being called by a vampire, he is in a pool and the camera is underwater.
The caption appears as blood red text that dissolves as blood would in water.

== Production ==

Kinetic typography is often produced using standard animation programs, including Adobe Flash, Adobe After Effects, and Apple Motion. The effect is most often achieved by compositing layers of text such that either individual letters or words can be animated separately from the rest.

* ANSI art allowed for animation based on text characters.
* AAlib allows to convert moving images into ASCII art.

<text>JBW Cars was a British racing car manufacturer in the late 1950s, who were a Formula One constructor from to 1961.

Brian Naylor, an amateur driver from Stockport, financed his mechanic Fred Wilkinson to build a number of sports cars that were competitive against second-level national fields but were not competitive on the international stage. As well as constructing their own sports racers, JBW also prepared and entered Cooper single-seater racing cars for Naylor to drive in Formula Two and occasional Formula One events.

==Formula One==
Following two seasons competing in Formula Two races with the JBW Cooper T43 and T45, Brian Naylor decided to enter Formula One proper in 1959. To achieve this Fred Wilkinson constructed a car — the JBW Type 1 — that was strongly influenced by the contemporary Cooper designs, and carried its Maserati engine behind the driver. The first appearance of the JBW-Maserati was at the pre-season BRDC International Trophy non-Championship race at Silverstone, on 2 May 1959. Naylor arrived too late to post a qualifying time, and retired on lap 41 of the race with gearbox failure. On 18 July Naylor appeared in the JBW car at the 1959 British Grand Prix at Aintree. Although he managed to qualify ahead of such well known drivers as Tony Brooks, Jack Fairman and Ivor Bueb, again the JBW let Naylor down and the car&#x27;s transmission failed on lap 18. One final outing that year resulted in a failure even to qualify, after Naylor suffered an accident during practice for the Gold Cup race at Oulton Park on 26 September.

The JBW Type 1 did not appear again until the following year&#x27;s International Trophy race, on 14 May 1960. While Naylor and the JBW-Maserati qualified in 25th and last place, by the finish he had worked his way up to 11th position, the car lasting the distance for the first time in a competitive event. Unfortunately for Naylor, the first race of the World Championship season, the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix, was not to provide such positive results and he once again failed to qualify. However, his next race, the 1960 British Grand Prix provided Brian Naylor with his best ever Championship finish, after he came home in 13th place, having qualified in 18th place. His run of form continued at the Brands Hatch Silver City Trophy event on 1 August, where he finished 11th. Things appeared even to be looking up for the JBW team when Naylor qualified the JBW-Maserati in 7th position for the 1960 Italian Grand Prix at Monza, but his luck had begun to change and the car&#x27;s gearbox failed on the 42nd lap. One further World Championship race (in the USA) and two non-Championship events in the remainder of the 1960 season all resulted in early retirements.

The JBW-Maserati had further outings in the 1961 Intercontinental Formula events, but on each occasion Naylor failed to finish. The car also ran with a 1.5-litre Maserati engine in some non-Championship events, but with no better result. For the World Championship and most other Formula One events Naylor and Wilkinson decided to switch to Coventry Climax power, and redesigned the JBW car around their &quot;FPF&quot;, straight-4 motor. This new car — the JBW Type 2 — made its first appearance at the British Empire Trophy race at Silverstone (ironically an Intercontinental Formula event), but failed to finish. It also failed to reach the finishing flag in its only World Championship event, the 1961 Italian Grand Prix, but only a week later provided Naylor with his best ever finish when he took 9th place in the 1961 International Gold Cup at Oulton Park. Naylor only made one further appearance in the JBW-Climax, and retired on the first lap of the Brands Hatch-hosted Lewis-Evans Trophy. At the end of the 1961 season, and in increasingly poor health, Naylor retired from competition and wound up JBW Cars.

<text>Pinoy rock, or Filipino rock, is the brand of rock music produced in the Philippines or by Filipinos. It has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself, and bands adopting this style are now further classified under more specific genres or combinations of genres like alternative rock, post-grunge, ethnic, new wave, pop rock, punk rock, funk, reggae, heavy metal, ska, and recently, indie. Because these genres are generally considered to fall under the broad rock music category, Pinoy rock may be more specifically defined as rock music with Filipino cultural sensibilities.

==History==
===1960s: Early years===
In the early 1960s, electric guitars, drum sets, amplifiers, and echo machines became more available. Filipino instrumental bands popularly called &quot;combos&quot; formed all over the country. They emulated American and British bands like the Fireballs, the Ventures, the Gamblers, and the Shadows. Ramon Jacinto (RJ) and his band the Riots were considered the Ventures of the Philippines.

The arrival of the Beatles in 1966 signaled the end of instrumental music as a genre. Influenced by the British Invasion of which the Beatles were a part of, many Filipino bands began adopting similar musical styles. The Dynasonics (later known as the Dynasouls, and also known as the &quot;Pinoy Beatles&quot;) were the premier Beatles band in the country. Other popular combos of the era were D&#x27;Swooners (featuring Edmond Fortuno, future drummer for Juan de la Cruz Band and Anak Bayan), D&#x27;Downbeats (featuring Pepe Smith, future drummer / lead vocalist for Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki and Juan de la Cruz Band), who were the top billed opening act for The Beatles concert on July 4, 1966, at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum in Manila, the Hi-Jacks (featuring Eddie Mesa, &quot;The Filipino Elvis&quot;), the Bits N’ Pieces, the Boots &#x27;n&#x27; Saddles, the Moonstrucks, Tilt Down Men and hundreds of others.

Only a few years earlier, teens formed informal groups using instruments like ukuleles, guitars, and gas cans with a single rope for a stand-up bass and often without amplification. It was similar to the British with their skiffle music, except that Pinoys sang Elvis&#x27;s songs, not railroad songs. One of the first popular Filipino rockers was Bobby Gonzales, had a hit called &quot;Hahabol-Habol&quot;. Eddie Mesa, another teen idol from the period, became known as the &quot;Elvis Presley of the Philippines&quot;. As in the 1960s, many Filipinos referred then to rock bands as &quot;combos&quot;. Many of these used nontraditional instruments like floor-bass bongos, maracas, and gas tanks.

Easy listening was the popular genre for much of the decade which saw the popularity of Patti Page, Jo Stafford, Perry Como, and Pat Boone, among others. Ricky Nelson, Paul Anka, and Neil Sedaka became teen favorites in the last years of the 1950s. Rock as Filipinos know it did not really attract teenage Filipinos attention until the Ventures and the Shadows came along.

===1970s: Manila sound and classic Pinoy rock===
Into the early 1970s, Filipino music was growing more nationalistic and socio-political in nature, as well as using Tagalog more often. Pop music still dominated the airwaves with disco and funk bands such as Hotdog (band) and APO Hiking Society. Songs like Hotdog&#x27;s &quot;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re the Miss Universe of My Life&quot;) combined Filipino and English (also known as Taglish) within the same song. Rico J. Puno&#x27;s cover of &quot;The Way We Were&quot; dominated the airwaves in the mid 1970s and slowly but surely, the popularity of Pinoy pop continued till the end of the decade. Coinciding with the slow demise of that genre was the birth and acceptance of OPM rock. This helped innovate the so-called &quot;Manila sound&quot;. Coincidentally, punk and grunge music were re-directing musical trends world-wide and Pinoy rockers followed suit in no time with their own original material.

At this point in time, emerging social and political consciousness somehow crept into the industry with the traditional allied genres that are folk and rock music. Folk musicians and bands included Freddie Aguilar, Asin, Heber Bartolome and Florante. (In 1978, Freddie Aguilar&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Anak&quot;, became the most commercially successful Filipino recording in history. The song became known also in other Asian countries and in Europe.) Perhaps Asin, an ethnic-folk band, was the first commercial band to successfully bring a pro-environment song to the airwaves with &quot;Masdan Mo ang Kapaligiran&quot;. Also famous for providing subtle rebellious (anti-Marcos dictatorship sentiment was growing at that time) and peace messages behind its skillful vocal harmonizing, Asin gave the masses hits such as &quot;Bayan Kong Sinilangan (Cotabato)&quot; and &quot;Balita&quot;.

Juan de la Cruz Band, a garage and blues-rock influenced group consisting of drummer Joey &quot;Pepe&quot; Smith, bassist Mike Hanopol, and lead guitarist Wally Gonzales, are often credited for ushering in the first &quot;rock &amp; roll revolution&quot; in the Philippines that lasted from the late 1960s to the late 1970s (also known as the &quot;Golden Age of Pinoy Rock&quot;).

Being influenced by the counterculture, the bands of the 1970s were known to have never been sidelined commercially and sometimes took the center stage by storm. The radio station DZRJ, particularly the AM weekend &quot;Pinoy Rock and Rhythm&quot; show hosted by the ex-Fine Arts student from Philippine Women&#x27;s University named Dante David, also known as Howlin&#x27; Dave, provided the much-needed support and publicity to Pinoy rock during this era.

===1980s===
In the early to mid-1980s, groups like RP, with Goff Macaraeg and Bob Aves, Nuklus, Sinaglahi, UP Sintunado, Patatag, Tambisan, and soloists like the nationalist folk rock singers Paul Galang and Jess Santiago, the progressive folk duo Inang Laya, the progressive Pinoy rock band the Jerks, and Noel Cabangon were a hit on street concerts and campus tours. These groups of artists reunited and formed Buklod (Bukluran ng mga Musikero para sa Bayan), which later Rom Dongeto of Sinaglahi, Noel Cabangon, and Rene Bongcocan of Lingkod Sining took as their new band name when it disbanded after the EDSA Revolution.

The Dawn is another Pinoy rock band that emerged in the 1980s; the songs that they created were influenced by new wave and post-punk. The Dawn released their independently released single &quot;Enveloped Ideas&quot; in 1986.

Many music journalists and enthusiasts, as well as musicians themselves, attributed the flourishing in the mid-1980s of new wave and post-punk influenced bands to DWXB-FM, which began playing independently released singles of unsigned local bands. Other bands emerged, including Dean&#x27;s December, Ethnic Faces, Identity Crisis, and Violent Playground, all of which were able to record and release their respective albums in the years that followed.

Another band named the Wuds was formed in the 1980s; its members were composed of Alfred Guevara (bass), Bobby Balingit (guitar) and Aji Adriano (drums). The group was established in July 1983. Guevara and Bobby Wuds Balingit were sing-along home boys that were born and bred in the streets of a tough Manila neighborhood. Before forming the group, Guevera and Balingit had first created an acoustic folk singing group called Think God, playing covers of James Taylor and Crosby, Stills and Nash songs at various Shakey&#x27;s Pizza parlors in the Philippines. They changed their name to the Woods, after the Jethro Tull album &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;. Bobby Wuds continues to perform; he attended a street concert in Baguio City during the Baguio Day Celebrations in 2012 that was organized in Assumption Road by Christel Pay Seng.

===1990s===
During the start of the decade, The Hayp, Introvoys and After Image were among the prominent bands receiving mainstream recognition. An underground music scene was already burgeoning in some unknown bars in Manila. Red Rocks (which later became Club Dredd), together with Mayric&#x27;s (Sazi&#x27;s Music Bar) and Kampo (Yosh in the mid &#x27;90s), were the only venues where unsigned bands were allowed to play their own songs. Bands were influenced by such genres as power pop, shoegaze, post-punk, alternative rock (Eraserheads, Color It Red, The Youth, Half Life Half Death, Feet like Fins, Advent Call, Alamid, Parokya Ni Edgar), Dominion Gothic, hard rock, heavy metal (Razorback, Askals, Wolfgang, Dahong Palay), hardcore Loads of Motherhood, RDA, punk Philippine Violators, Bad Omen and death metal (Skychurch, Genital Grinder, Death After Birth, Disinterment, Mass Carnage, Savannah&#x27;s tool, Aroma, Kabaong ni Kamatayan, Barang, WUDS, Yano, Bad Omen, Rumblebelly, Disinterment (Death Metal Philippines), Dethrone, Signos (Cebu City&#x27;s underground death metal) and Iconoclast.

The late 1980s and early 1990s marked the beginning of what was known as the era of underground rock and progressive music, with NU107.5 playing unknown bands through Francis Brew&#x27;s &quot;In the Raw&quot;. It was through this station that many of the prominent and promising rock bands were discovered such as The Breed, GreyHoundz, Slapshock, Sugar Free, Fatal Posporos, Itchy Worms, Peryodiko, Monsterbot, Tanya Markova, Pedicab, and many others. NU107.5 was the only radio station that played music longer than the standard radio format would allow, as well as soundtracks (The Reel Score). Apart from allotting air time to new and known foreign rock bands such as Save Ferris, Veruca Salt, Metallica, Firehouse, Bon Jovi, Harem Scarem, Audioslave and Soundgarden etc., it gave full exposure to Filipino groups such as Sugar Hiccup, Eraserheads, Imago, Cynthia Alexander, Parokya ni Edgar, Wolfgang, Razorback, Ciudad, Teeth, Urbandub, Put3ska, Tropical Depression, Rivermaya, Yano, Siakol, and Cheese. Its prestigious NU107 Rock Awards honored the Philippine rock industry&#x27;s best and brightest for 17 years.

To add to the plight of the underground bands, radio stations would not play their music due to the payola system in the radio industry despite the fact that most of these bands, if not all, had self-produced (indie) albums. But DWLA 105.9 challenged the current system by providing a venue for the bands to broadcast their original songs. Pinoy rock enthusiasts were finally elated to hear their favorite underground bands ruling the airwaves.

The commercial success of Eraserheads paved the way for more Pinoy rock acts such as Rivermaya, Siakol, Rizal Underground and The Youth getting record deals and spawning singles such as &quot;Ulan&quot; and &quot;Bilanggo&quot;. Some brave all-female bands got signed (Kelt&#x27;s Cross, Tribal Fish, Agaw Agimat) and a few solo artists as well (Maegan Aguilar, Bayang Barrios, DJ Alvaro). Rappers crossed over with great success (Francis M with Hardware Syndrome and Erectus), despite some earlier controversy with hip hop-bashing allegedly incited by some artists. These bands adopted a variety of influences both in image and music; many fell under a particular genre; however, the crossing over of styles was most often inevitable.
By the ‘90s, the hardcore punk scene had begun to die down in Manila. “All the punks disappeared,” recalls Jep Peligro, creator of Konspirazine, a prominent zine published in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s documenting the local DIY music scene. Still, there were hubs of activity in places such as in Laguna, a province southeast of Manila with a rich DIY punk culture, and the neighboring Cavite region, which is jointly called Strong South known as the punk capital of the Philippines.

===2000s===
In the early 2000s, hip hop, reggae, acoustic pop/jazz and R&amp;B-influenced bands dominated the Philippine music scene, causing Pinoy rock to take a backseat. Only a number of Pinoy rock bands managed to stay in the mainstream during this period. In 2003, a not-so-well-known home-educated DJ named DJ RO started playing in a small bar and restaurant known as Gweilos; DJ RO helped promote the club every Monday night while there was an emergence of Filipino rock bands like Bamboo, Orange and Lemons and Kitchie Nadal that started performing in Gweilos and eventually became popular. In 2004, Pinoy rock once again gained prominence, with the rise of yet another wave of Filipino rock bands. During this time, the Pinoy rock music scene in Cebu also gained exposure.

2001 saw the indie band the Pin-Up Girls, made up of former Keltscross members and underground musicians, signing to Know-It-All Records in Tacoma, Washington, making them the first Manila-based band to sign with an American label. The Pin-Up Girls released an EP worldwide called &quot;Taste Test&quot; that sold out. Know-It-All then printed a new batch dubbed &quot;Taste Test: The Expanded Menu&quot;. The rest of the 2000s further ushered in the mainstream buzz on Pinoy rock, and along with it bands that leaned more towards pop sensibilities. During this time, bands such as Hale, Cueshe, Sponge Cola and Callalily gained mainstream exposure.

2006 was when Filipino band, Kāla appeared in the commercial music scene with their full-length album titled &quot;Manila High&quot;, distributed by SonyBMG Music Entertainment. Their first hit was &quot;Jeepney&quot; which was released in the summer of 2006. According to the Philippine &quot;Daily Inquirer&quot;, the band started the resurgence of the Manila sound genre into the modern world through their own mix of funky, jazzy electronic rock music. The band was also part of the tribute album &quot;Hopia Mani Popcorn&quot;. They made a funky remake of VST &amp; Co.&#x27;s &quot;Rock Baby Rock&quot; which hit number 1 in the airwaves.

In recent years as well, bands like Urbandub, Pupil, Chicosci, Slapshock and Typecast have also played in other countries such as Singapore and the US, amongst others. Some have even garnered nominations and recognition from internationally based publications and award-giving bodies. This is mainly attributed to the effect of the internet and globalization on almost anything including music, as listeners from other countries can now see and hear songs and videos of bands overseas without leaving their country.

===2010s===
In mid-2010, NU 107, known as the nation&#x27;s premier FM station using a rock format, had been taken down as it was sold by its management after declining interest in the audience. In the early 2010s, rock music was still largely popular in the country despite a decline in sales, due to the domination of K-pop, pop and electronic music, and the rise of music streaming services.

During the early 2010s, new acts emerged such as Gracenote and Tanya Markova. Up Dharma Down, later became UDD in 2017, became an early staple of a resurgence with the popularity of their signature single &quot;Tadhana&quot; and the release of their 2012 album &quot;Capacities&quot;.

Following NU leaving the airwaves, another FM station, Jam 88.3 fully transitioned to alternative rock/indie pop, including songs played by local popular rock artists and bands. Since 2013, the station began playing songs from local and unsigned Filipino independent artists/bands through its supplemental program &quot;Fresh Filter&quot;.

2013 saw the re-emergence of Pinoy indie music. Some indie acts became popular (and eventually went mainstream) such as Autotelic, Bullet Dumas, Ang Bandang Shirley, Cheats, BP Valenzuela, She&#x27;s Only Sixteen, The Ransom Collective, Oh, Flamingo!, Sud, MilesExperience, Tom&#x27;s Story, Ben&amp;Ben, IV of Spades, Clara Benin, Reese Lansangan, and others. Today, various indie bands continue to perform through daily/weekly gig schedules at popular gig places like B-Side and SaGuijo in Makati, Route 196 (closed in 2020) and Mow&#x27;s Bar in Quezon City, 19 East in Parañaque, 70s Bistro in Anonas, and at various music festivals (such as Wanderland, UP (University of the Philippines) Fair, Rakrakan Festival, and Fete de la Musique Philippines).

In 2015, entrepreneur and musician Ramon &quot;RJ&quot; Jacinto launched the Pinoy Rock &#x27;n Roll Hall of Fame, which was established to recognize notable Filipino musicians.

During the final years of the 2010s, the genre also gave prominence of Pinoy artists from outside the Philippine territory, including UK-based Filipino independent artists Beabadoobee and No Rome.

===2020s===
The COVID-19 pandemic halted the Philippine music industry, with many music venues being closed and concerts/festivals being either postponed or canceled. But the pandemic also gave artists and bands more time to bring new releases, recorded from their respective homes.

The late 2010s/early 2020s gave birth of new breed of rock and indie artists/bands: Magnus Haven, Bandang Lapis, the Vowels They Orbit, Maki, Lola Amour and Nobita. Zild Benitez and Ena Mori released their own solo recordings.

<text>Michael Granville Valpy (born 1942) is a Canadian journalist and author. He wrote for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper where he covered both political and human interest stories until leaving the newspaper in October, 2010. Through a long career at the &quot;Globe&quot;, he was a reporter, Toronto- and Ottawa-based national political columnist, member of the editorial board, deputy managing editor, and Africa-based correspondent during the last years of apartheid. He has also been a national political columnist for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;. Since leaving the &quot;Globe&quot; he has been published by the newspaper on a freelance basis as well as by CBC News Online, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot;.

==Life==
Valpy was born in 1942 in Toronto and lived there until his family moved to Vancouver, where his mother&#x27;s family was from, after World War II. His great-grandfather, W. W. Walkem, was Vancouver&#x27;s first European doctor and the brother of George Anthony Walkem, British Columbia&#x27;s third premier. He has three children. He has been married and divorced twice, first with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s former chief librarian, Amanda Ferguson, and second with lawyer Deborah Coyne.

==Career==
Valpy studied at the University of British Columbia towards a general arts degree for two years before dropping out of university after the premature death of his father and having no money to continue his studies. After considering entering the Anglican priesthood, Valpy went to work for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; in 1961 as a reporter and was then night city editor at the short-lived &quot;Vancouver Times&quot;. In 1965, when the Times folded, he was hired by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; first as a reporter, then as a feature writer and member of the editorial board. In 1966 and 1967, Valpy was a staff member for the short-lived Company of Young Canadians. He returned to the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, first as a member of its editorial board and then as a political columnist based in Ottawa, Ontario. 

On 13 December 1971, Valpy revealed in an article the secret deal brokered by Justice William Henderson to end the trial of the &quot;Kingston 13&quot;. During the 1971 Kingston Penitentiary riot, a group of inmates led by Brian Beaucage had tortured 16 men and killed 2 of them. In October 1971, the &quot;Kingston 13&quot; as the accused were known went on trial in Kingston. Valpy revealed that there had been a secret deal to end the trial as Justice Henderson had called several meetings with the defense lawyers and the Crown Attorneys to discuss how to arrange plea bargains to give the accused the lightest possible sentences with led to a sudden end to the trial on 22 November 1971. 

In 1981, he rejoined &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as a national affairs columnist and subsequently served as its Africa correspondent from 1984 to 1988 after which he returned to Canada to serve as the newspaper&#x27;s urban affairs columnist, its deputy managing editor and, after running for Parliament for the NDP, as the paper&#x27;s religion writer and feature writer.

Valpy left &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2010. He is a senior fellow at Massey College at the University of Toronto, a fellow at the University of Toronto School of Public Policy and Governance and teaches in the university&#x27;s book and media studies program. He was the 2011–2012 Canwest Global Fellow in Media at University of Western Ontario and was awarded the 2012–2013 Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy. He continues to write as a freelance journalist with pieces published on the &quot;CBC News&quot; website and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as well as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

==Political views==
Despite being from what he describes as a &quot;strongly Tory monarchist British imperialist-quite right wing&quot; family, Valpy was one of the more left-leaning writers at the &quot;Globe&quot;. In the 2000 federal election, Valpy ran as a New Democratic Party candidate in the Toronto riding of Trinity—Spadina, against Liberal Party of Canada incumbent Tony Ianno. He was not elected.

==Works==
Valpy co-authored three books (two on Canada&#x27;s Constitution and the third on the 21st-century generation of new Canadian adults), produced public affairs documentaries for CBC Radio, contributed chapters to several books on public policy issues and written for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Time Canada&quot;, &quot;Policy Options&quot;, &quot;Shambhala Sun&quot; and &quot;Elm Street&quot; magazines.

==Awards==
He has won three National Newspaper Awards (two for foreign reporting and one for an analysis of dysfunctional students in the public education system) and been nominated for a fourth (for a profile of Michael Ignatieff), In 1997, he was awarded an honorary doctorate (D.Litt.) from Trent University. He also received the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal in 2002.

<text>Denver Sylvester Dickerson (January 24, 1872 – November 28, 1925) was an American politician. He was the 11th governor of Nevada from 1908 to 1911. A member of the Silver – Democratic coalition party, he had previously held office as the 13th lieutenant governor of Nevada from 1907 to 1908. During his governorship, Dickerson worked to reform the state prison system.

After leaving office, Dickerson became the Superintendent of Federal Prisons, predecessor to the present-day Federal Bureau of Prisons. He was the warden of Nevada State Prison until his death in 1925.

==Biography==
Dickerson was born on January 24, 1872, to Harvey Franklin and Catherine Melinda Dickerson in Millville in Shasta County, California. His father was a mining pioneer in California. Dickerson received a public school education and was later privately tutored. Dickerson pursued mining in Idaho, Montana, and Nevada.

During the Spanish–American War in 1898, Dickerson was deployed as Sergeant of Troop D of the 2nd U.S. Volunteer Cavalry. Upon returning from his tour of duty as First Sergeant in 1899, Dickerson moved to White Pine County, Nevada.

===Settlement in Nevada===

In 1902, Dickerson was elected to his first office, the clerk of White Pine County and later became county recorder. On April 23, 1904, Dickerson married Una Reilly of Cherry Creek, Nevada, in a ceremony held in Eureka, Nevada. On November 24, 1904, Dickerson and Charles A. Walker acquired the &quot;White Pine News&quot;. By October 19, 1905, Dickerson was the newspaper&#x27;s editor and sole proprietor.

===State politics===
In 1906, Dickerson decided to run for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada. While attending the Democratic State Convention in Reno as a young delegate, he discovered that no one was interested in running for the office. In May of that year, he handed over control of the &quot;White Pine News&quot; to Houlden Hudgins and sold it in the fall. On October 11, 1906, Dickerson founded the &quot;Ely Mining Expositor&quot; as a weekly paper representing the interests of the Silver-Democratic political coalition. Dickerson won the November election and took office in January 1907. The &quot;Ely Mining Expositor&quot; was helmed by various editors while Dickerson was in office and moved to daily publication by May 15, 1907.

When fellow Silver-Democrat and Governor John Sparks died in office on May 22, 1908, Dickerson became the acting governor. The Dickersons became the first family to move into the Nevada Governor&#x27;s Mansion, recently completed at a cost of $22,700. On September 2, 1909, Una gave birth to June, the only child to be born in the mansion. During his gubernatorial tenure, Dickerson worked to restructure state mental hospitals and reform the state prison system. He also found support to reorganize the state Railroad Commission.

====The &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;====
In 1910, former undefeated boxing champion James J. Jeffries sought to reclaim the heavyweight championship as the &quot;great white hope&quot; from African-American Jack Johnson. Dickerson was impressed by Johnson&#x27;s boxing skills and pledged to provide an opportunity for a match in Nevada without racial prejudice. Despite national pressure against staging the event, Dickerson allowed it to proceed in Reno. Promoter Tex Rickard assured Dickerson that it would be a fair fight. On July 4, 1910, Johnson defeated Jeffries, causing a wave of unrest across the country. In the election of November 1910, Dickerson was defeated and left office on January 2, 1911.

===Later work===
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, Dickerson was appointed superintendent of the Nevada State Police. In 1913, Dickerson was appointed the Warden of Nevada State Prison in Carson City to replace George W. Cowing, who had problems finding men willing to form a firing squad to execute convicted murderer Andriza Mircovich. The death sentence was eventually carried out by a custom-built shooting machine.

Dickerson took office as the Superintendent of Federal Prisons in January 1920 under U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. In September 1920, Jack Johnson was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas for incarceration while under Dickerson&#x27;s administration. Dickerson worked to have Johnson paroled against unsubstantiated charges. Dickerson resigned on April 2, 1921, when newly elected President Warren G. Harding announced that he would appoint his brother-in-law Heber Herbert Votaw to the office.

In December 1923, Dickerson returned to Nevada State Prison. He supervised the execution of Gee Jon in February 1924, the first to be carried out by gas chamber in the United States. Dickerson remained warden until his death in November 1925.

===Legacy===

Dickerson was buried at Lone Mountain Cemetery in Carson City. Afterwards, his wife Una was appointed head librarian of the law library at the courthouse in Reno, Nevada. She later retired in Reno and died on April 9, 1959, and was buried next to her husband.

The Dickersons had eight children: Harvey, Norinne, June, Donald, Denver, Belford, Barbara and George. Their sons Harvey, Denver, and George followed their father&#x27;s footsteps into Nevada state politics. Harvey Dickerson was elected Attorney General of Nevada in 1954 and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1958.
Re-elected in 1962 and 1966, Dickerson became the only three time Attorney General of Nevada to serve bifurcated terms of office. The younger Denver Dickerson would go on to become the Speaker of the Nevada Assembly in 1943 and was appointed Secretary of Guam in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. George M. Dickerson was elected District Attorney of Clark County, Nevada in 1954 and President of the State Bar of Nevada in 1973. George&#x27;s older brother Harvey was the first of three Dickersons to serve as the president of the State Bar of Nevada in 1953. George&#x27;s son Robert P. Dickerson was the third to serve in 1997.

<doc id="1233357" wikidata="Q3437861" url="?curid=1233357" title="Rock music in Mexico">
<text>Mexican rock music, often referred to in Mexico as rock nacional (&quot;national rock&quot;), originated in the 1950s. Standards by The Beatles, Elvis Presley, The Everly Brothers, Nancy Sinatra, and Chuck Berry were soon covered by bands such as Los Apson, Los Teen Tops, Los Twisters, Los Hitters, Los Nómadas, Los Rockets, , Los Locos del Ritmo, , and Javier Bátiz, which later led to original compositions, often in English. The group &quot;Los Nómadas&quot; was the first racially integrated band of the 1950s. Their lead guitarist, Bill Aken (adopted son of Lupe Mayorga, effectively making Aken the cousin of Ritchie Valens), wrote most of their original material, including the raucous &quot;Donde-Donde&quot;, and co-wrote the material for their &quot;Sounds Of The Barrio&quot; album, which is still being sold. Their 1954 recording of &quot;She&#x27;s My Babe&quot; was the first top 40 R&amp;B recording by a Latino band. In the southwestern United States, Spanish guitar rhythms and Mexican musical influences may have inspired some of the music of American musicians Ritchie Valens, Danny Flores (of The Champs), Sam the Sham, Roy Orbison, and later, Herb Alpert. Initially, the public exhibited only moderate interest in them, because the media attention was focused on &quot;La Ola Inglesa&quot; (British Invasion).

However, after the substantial success of Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana in the United States in the late 1960s, along with the successful development of Mexico&#x27;s own counterculture movement called La Onda (The Wave), many bands sprang up. Most of these bands sang in both Spanish and English, keeping foreign commercial exposure in mind. Mexican and &quot;Chicano rock&quot; have crossed into other Hispanic groups like José Feliciano and Lourdes Rodriguez, of Puerto Rican descent.

==Origins: Orchestra and Jazz==
Rock activity in Mexico in the 1950s took place either in Mexico City and the surrounding area or in northern cities such as Mexicali, Monterrey, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Juárez and Tijuana, whose proximity to the United States gave them more exposure to American sounds.

Rock &amp; roll music was introduced to Mexico in the mid 1950s, as musicians like Elvis Presley and Bill Haley were at the peak of their popularity in the US, and their music began to be broadcast in Mexico and covered by Mexican bands.

Except for Tijuana and Los Tj&#x27;s. In those early years, the first acts that performed and recorded rock &amp; roll in the country were not rock &quot;bands&quot;, but rather orchestras that combined jazz sounds with the new genre. Gloria Ríos, an American-born actress and lounge singer, is often credited with introducing rock &amp; roll music in Mexico. Born in Texas in 1928, Ríos arrived in Mexico in 1944 and began recording in 1955 with many musicians (and their orchestras), such as Héctor Hallal, Jorge Ortega, Pablo Beltrán Ruiz, and most importantly, with Mario Patrón and his Estrellas del Ritmo. Many of her recordings were covers of songs by Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, but with Las Estrellas del Ritmo she also recorded &quot;La mecedora&quot; in 1956, a song composed by Mario Patrón, which was said to be the first original song of Mexican rock &amp; roll. Ríos became very popular at the time due to her starring roles in films like &quot;Las locuras del rock and roll&quot; (1956) and &quot;La rebelión de los adolescentes&quot; (1957), but she later married Mario Patrón and in 1960 she went with him to Europe, where they stayed for many years.

This caused Ríos to be quickly forgotten in Mexico, as the new golden age of rock &amp; roll was starting there and new bands claimed to be the ones who had introduced the genre in Mexico. Ríos died in 2002 at the age of 74 years old.

These orchestras soon started to lose popularity as new rock bands appeared, formed by young musicians who mostly covered American and British songs. Los Lunáticos, founded in 1956, are considered by many to be the first Mexican rock and roll band, and later other bands like Los Locos del Ritmo, Los Rebeldes del Rock, Los Teen Tops, etc. became popular. Las Mary Jets, formed in 1959, were the first all-female rock band in Mexico. Rock, as elsewhere, became tied with the youth revolt of the 1960s.

Many songs are credited as being the first original Mexican rock &amp; roll songs, amongst them:

*&quot;La mecedora&quot; (1956), written by Mario Patrón and recorded by his orchestra and Gloria Ríos. This is considered to be the first original Mexican rock song in Spanish.
*&quot;Mexican rock and roll&quot; (1956), written by Pablo Beltrán Ruiz and recorded by his orchestra, it&#x27;s an instrumental piece.
*&quot;Where Did You Get It?&quot; (1957), written by José Luis Arcaráz and recorded in English by Los Lunáticos.

Bands of the 1950s and, to a lesser degree, were often associated with the middle-class youth of Mexico. Fearing a &quot;Moral Crisis,&quot; the PRI-controlled government imposed restrictions on rock music and films, in an effort to protect the &quot;Buenas Costumbres,&quot; or proper family values, by &quot;avoid[ing] noxious or disturbing influences on the harmonious development of children and youth.&quot; These guides caused any particularly &quot;rebellious&quot; media, including movies and rock, to conform to the PRI&#x27;s Buenas Costumbres to get their work officially published. In addition, both to protect Mexico&#x27;s record industry, and simultaneously discourage foreign-inspired challenges to the status quo, heavy tariffs were placed upon imported records. This combination of factors created the &quot;Refrito&quot; movement of the 1950s and early 1960s, where Mexican rock musicians reworked foreign songs to fit in with into the restrictions on music. One of the most popular examples is the song &quot;La Plaga&quot; by Los Teen Tops, a refrito cover of the Little Richard song &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly,&quot; where lyrics featuring elements of scandal and rebellion were toned down or altered by Los Teen Tops for the Mexican market.

While many musicians of the refrito era saw success, both domestically and internationally, their music was often criticized by those on the left as &quot;imperialist in nature,&quot; and by those on the right for still being too &quot;rebellious,&quot; both of which would carry on into the La Onda era of the late 1960s, particularly as the Mexican youth, particularly those associated with rock, became increasingly frustrated with the government and more progressive-leaning.

==Classic Rock==
The 1960s are considered to be the &quot;golden age&quot; for rock music in Mexico; during this decade, rock groups frequently dominated the music charts and many of them became teen idols.
In the early years of the decade, groups like Los Rebeldes del Rock (whose recording &quot;Hiedra venenosa&quot; is considered to have been the first rock and roll recording to be broadcast in Mexican radio, back in 1959), Los Hooligans, Los Locos del Ritmo, among many others, became very famous recording Spanish-language covers of American and British rock standards, as well as some original songs.

One group in particular, Los Teen Tops was very popular in Mexico and in many other countries of the Hispanic world, specifically in Argentina and Spain; their recordings &quot;La plaga&quot; and &quot;Popotitos&quot; are considered some of the most representative of the era.

The counterculture movement is generally agreed to have its roots along the USA-Mexico border, particularly in Tijuana, where the geographical proximity allowed for easier access to foreign music. Bands such as Los Dug Dugs found success covering songs by bands such as The Beach Boys and The Beatles, and soon moved to Mexico City. Other Northern bands would coalesce on Mexico City around this time, and by 1966, a cultural movement would begin to emerge around this music, incorporating contemporary aspects from American culture and fashion. This was called La Onda.

=== Rockeras ===
Women rock musicians, sometimes referred to as &quot;rockeras&quot;, played a sizeable, if often overlooked role in La Onda, and Mexican rock as a whole. Bands such as Las Mary Jets, Los Spitfires, and Las Chics were the most prominent in the 1960s, though were also subject to the restrictions and regulations placed on the genre by the PRI, as well as increased social stigma for playing rock music in a conservative society. After her band&#x27;s dissolution, Silvia Garcel of Las Chics reflected on this, saying of her televised performances &quot;They wanted us to look like little girls, well-dressed, modest, neat, and decent,&quot; but that this didn&#x27;t reflect their style: &quot;We wore miniskirts, but only as part of the show. In real life, we didn&#x27;t wear them[,]&quot; instead preferring to wear the blue jeans associated with the American-influenced La Onda movement. Often times, however, the social and political constraints would prove to win out against more progressive themes, epitomized by Angélica María, who bore the title &quot;Mexico&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; in a social role that served as both a role model for young women and girls, and an object of enamor and adoration among men. Because of this, more rebellious rockeras were further vilified in the public eye, when compared to the pure, more socially acceptable Angélica María.

===Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro, La Onda===
Many Mexican rock stars became involved in the counterculture movement. One of the most notorious bands from this decade was La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata, from Guadalajara, Mexico. After winning a local contest, they signed a contract with Polydor Records, and their single &quot;Nasty Sex&quot; was a #1 hit in Mexico in 1971, the only rock song from a Mexican band to achieve such a feat in that decade. However, after many members left the band and the Mexican government severely restricted the recording, publishing, and airplay of rock music in the country, the band (like many others at the time) changed its format and became a romantic ballad group.

The two-day Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro, held in 1971, was organized in the hamlet of Tenantongo near the city of Toluca, a town neighboring Mexico City, and became known as &quot;The Mexican Woodstock&quot;.

At that rock festival, nudity, free love, experimental drug use, profanity, the peace sign inserted in the Mexican flag and the presence of the American flag so scandalized the conservative Mexican society that the government imposed cultural curbs to La Onda, and especially to rock music. The media called the move &quot;El Avandarazo&quot;. The festival, intended to emulate Woodstock and Altamont, expected to attract a maximum of 25,000 concertgoers but about 300,000 showed up. The government helped some stranded attendees at the end of the festival by sending 300 buses.

During President Luis Echeverría&#x27;s administration, the Mexican government tried to win back the country&#x27;s legitimacy through populist, leftist-oriented programmes.

Most things that could possibly be connected to the counterculture or to student protests were sidelined on public airwaves by the powers that be, who feared a repeat of the student protests of 1968, an event the new government denounced. But most Mexican rock bands sang and criticized the administration in general and, more specifically, corruption, poverty and persistent social inequalities that had taken place through Mexican history.

With the Avandarazo effect at its height and the hippie movement waning worldwide, few bands survived the curbs; though the ones that did, like Three Souls in My Mind (later El Tri), remained popular due in part to their adoption of Spanish for their lyrics, and had a dedicated following. As the hippie trend waned c. 1973, many Mexican bands moved to progressive and hard rock. During the seventies there were many new bands but very little support from the music industry for original rock music. The bands suffered from it and had to limit themselves to performing in . Representative bands of this period were: Perro Fantastico, Mara, Vox Populi, Stray Cat, Rock Moviloy and many more. Perro Fantastico, a band from the east side of Mexico City (Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl) created rock music sung in both Spanish and English, formed by the brothers Jose Luis and Jaime Francisco González (guitar and bass) with Guillermo Avalos (drums) and Arturo Fajardo (rhythm guitar). They played, among other bands, in places like Salon Chicago, Macumba, El Herradero until the band disbanded around 1978. During the seventies bands also performed in high schools, universities and other places. Many others followed or continued during the eighties.

===Ban on Rock===
The government&#x27;s ban on rock music during this decade also extended to American groups, and after a 1975 concert in Mexico City by the band Chicago ended with turbulence and police repression, president Echeverría issued a temporary ban on all concerts by American musicians in Mexico.

== Punk and Underground Rock ==
After various government crackdowns and restrictions on rock, particularly after the 1971 Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro, the bands that remained together or formed during this time moved into an underground scene, centered around Mexico City, where the rock and its subgenres finally started to see adoption among the lower classes of Mexican society. This created an entirely new movement, with musicians and fans of their music formed &quot;bandas.&quot; Many in these bands created names based on their imposed lower position, such as Mierdas Punk, Manchados, and Punks Not Dead. After the Catholic Church began disparaging these bandas on the basis of assumed Satanism, new bandas formed with names based on this supposed tie to Satanism, such as Abadón, Lucifer, and Blasfemia.

As most rock musicians, particularly anti-establishment ones, had great difficulty finding gigs at proper venues, the 1970s saw many bands performing in &quot;Hoyos Fonquis,&quot; literally &quot;funky holes,&quot; which were quite unsafe for the performers, as both audience members and police raids could prove harmful. Because of this, many bandas formed cultures of mutual self-defense, a trend that has continued into the modern day. In the 1980s, however, the PRI loosened their restrictions on rock performances, and the bands that had been playing in the Hoyos Fonquis now had access to larger, more legitimate audiences, particularly at the Tianguis del Chopo, a large open-air market in Mexico city, which became a hotspot for fans and practitioners of a variety of genres to come together and trade records, as well as attend live performances. Bands such as El Tri saw their earliest rise to success in this environment.

==Metal==

Since the 1960s, hard rock had been assimilated by several groups, like the aforementioned Los Dug Dugs and El Ritual, and later by others like Polvo and Náhuatl, Nuevo México and Bloody Rock. During the following decade it continued to exist in forms of heavy blues, which was an authentic underground movement, peaking in the late 1970s when the Hoyos Funky came to notoriety around 1977.

Groups like Ramses and La Cruz are veterans of the era and were some of the first to be labeled as &quot;heavy metal&quot;, but then again it was not until the 1980s and the early 1990s that bands like Transmetal, Next, Luzbel and Semefo contributed to the scene with original approaches, when the most radical forms of the genre like death metal and grindcore were fully digested. Today the metal scene is populated by such groups as Brujeria, Hacavitz, and Disgorge.

The early bands were followed by many others, in an ever-growing underground movement of sports arenas weekend concerts all over the country.

Important bands of this period were
==Rupestre Music==
Since the late 1960s, poets have sung to acoustic guitars and played in the then-prosperous café cantante scene. These forums showcased the folkloric music that came from South America, specially from Peru and Chile. Performers like Víctor Jara, Violeta Parra, Inti-Illimani, Los Folkloristas and local Óscar Chávez among many others denounced in their songs the atrocities of the military juntas, all of which experimented with even worse repression than Mexico during the Tlatelolco incident, that governed most of the countries from Nicaragua to Tierra del Fuego, and curiously the cafes cantantes thrived, as long as nothing was overtly critical of the Mexican government in general.

The scene eclipsed by the early 1980s, but several musicians like Rockdrigo, sometimes nicknamed &quot;the Mexican Bob Dylan&quot; developed a uniquely Mexican folk style, which came to be known as &quot;música rupestre&quot;. Later, the musicians were dubbed &#x27;Los Urbanos&#x27;, because although they played acoustic guitars, the themes of their lyrics revealed the adverse conditions the working class had to face in the big cities, and blues forms were incorporated in their compositions. When El Tri made an electric rendition of Rockdrigo&#x27;s &quot;Metro Balderas&quot; the fusion of rock and &quot;música rupestre&quot; was consummated. Many others continued to surface, but Rockdrigo&#x27;s untimely death during the earthquake of 1985 in Mexico City skyrocketed his already legendary status, and thus he is considered the most influential exponent of both &quot;rock urbano&quot; and &quot;música rupestre&quot;.

Other notable bands were Banda Bostik, Sur 16, Tex-Tex and Interpuesto. The racially integrated group Los Nómadas was one of the few to survive for decades. Members of the group consisted of Chico Vasquez, Jose &#x27;J.D.&#x27; Moreno, Abel Padilla, and Bill Aken, who formed the band in 1953; they stayed together until well into the 1990s. They were often called into recording sessions to back up Mexicano artists such as Freddy Fender. Their final recording session was in early 1994; when Chico Vasquez died several months later, the group disbanded. The most prominent member of the group was singer-songwriter and producer Bill Aken (aka Zane Ashton), the adopted son of Mexican actress Lupe Mayorga and the only Caucasian member of the band.

===The Chopo===

In 1980, the National University of Mexico UNAM, through one of its cultural departments, invited the general public to bring their LP records and trade them with others at the Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City, every Saturday morning.

Initially the trading took place inside the facilities of the museum, but by the end of the year the increasing number of attendees became too large for the venue, as collectors sought records that were otherwise impossible to get from established outlets. The trading became selling in many cases, with record dealers taking advantage of the new market for rock &quot;rarities&quot;. The gathering extended to the street right in front of the museum, and several stands were erected, transforming the event into a &quot;tianguis&quot;, a kind of outdoor flea market or bazaar. The museum became a popular hang-out for punks, new wavers, hippies, rastafaris, and other subcultures who were able to express themselves freely at the weekly gathering and meet others with the same tastes.

The museum and the National University eventually broke ties with the tianguis, stating that it had got out of hand, and due to increasing friction with local residents, the government soon tried to ban it. By now the participants had established themselves into a community, and collectively presented a proposition to the local government dependency, offering to maintain the necessary security and pay a permanent fee.

However, the officials were reluctant, and between 1982 and 1989 the &quot;Chopo&quot;, while still growing, changed locations six times, from parks to parking lots to faculty gardens, always due to pressure from officials.

Since 1990 it has been taking place on a street behind the Buenavista railway station, less than three blocks from the original &#x27;Museo del Chopo&#x27; location. From the original 100 people that began attending in 1980, it is estimated that more than 10,000 people now visit the tianguis every week. As well as the original record trading, other products sold and displayed at the event include clothing, posters, movies, handicrafts, magazines, books, instruments, and other rock-related paraphernalia.

==Spanish invasion and response==
Concurrent to the second wave British Invasion in the U.S., the Mexican rock scene in the early 1980s immediately fell prey to a “European Invasion” of its own with various artists from Spain taking over the radio. Influential Spanish rock bands like Hombres G, Mecano, Radio Futura and La Unión took over the spotlight with their experimental sounds and melancholic lyrics. Mexico’s music culture saw a newly inspired generation of rock bands emerge in response such Caifanes, Maná, Ritmo Peligroso, Botellita de Jeréz, El Tri and the Micro Chips.

Mexican pop music on the other hand (a genre known for its trademark ballads) saw an unexpected explosion of success by incorporating early synths into an overall more pop rock based production with bands such as Timbiriche, Pandora, and Flans dominating the charts alongside Spanish pop bands like Olé-Olé.

==Rock in Monterrey==


Starting in the 90s, the city of Monterrey in the Mexican state of Nuevo Léon witnessed the birth of several bands that have become internationally acclaimed. Their genres vary considerably, but they include COhETICA, El Gran Silencio, Genitallica, Jumbo, Kinky, Panda, Plastilina Mosh, The Warning, Volován, Zurdok and the heavy metal band IRA.

The song &quot;Los Oxidados&quot; by Plastilina Mosh opens the 2005 movie &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. Kinky performed at the 2004 edition of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, along with Radiohead, The Cure and The Killers.

The all-female heavy rock band, The Warning became internationally successful from the 2020s, making several concert tours in North-America and Europe, performing on major music festivals and even promoted by MTV. They are the first Latin-American band signed directly to a major US label company.

A few of the popular local live music venues in Monterrey include the Arena Monterrey, the Auditorio Banamex, and local clubs Cafe Iguana and McMullen&#x27;s, both located in the Barrio Antiguo section of the city.

== Indigenous Rock ==
Indigenous musicians have been a part of Mexican rock movements since at least the 1970s, but recently have seen an increase in popularity in recent decades, with artists from a myriad of backgrounds adding their distinct flair and sound to rock. Bands such as Sak Tzevul, Hamac Caziim, and Los Cogelones have been some of the most prevalent in the modern Indigenous rock scene, with each bringing their own distinct style through their cultural dress and language. Hamac Caziim in particular are invested in using the platform of music in order to more popularize and support the Comcaac language and community they are a part of.

Indigenous musicians have unfortunately always faced discrimination and undue criticism, with some critics deriding Indigenous rock as &quot;inauthentic&quot;, due to their western influence. Tzotzil band Sak Tzevul responded to this line of criticism by stating &quot;There are things so deeply rooted that neither Coca-Cola nor anyone else can take away from us.&quot;

==Alternative and Indie rock==


In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of performers have attained international renown, including alternative rock acts such as Santa Sabina, Café Tacuba, Fobia, Caifanes (now Jaguares), Julieta Venegas, ska band Maldita Vecindad, and synthpop group Mœnia.

Control Machete, Delasónica and Molotov explored rap/rock fusion, with lyrics containing social commentary mixed with urban vulgarity. The most popular Mexican rock group during this period has been Maná, which have sold over 22 million albums worldwide.

The 2010s saw the rise of a new generation of bands like Camilo Séptimo, Little Jesus, and The Warning, blending indie rock with electronic, synth-pop, and even funk influences. This period also saw the emergence of more experimental sounds, with acts like Molotov and Café Tacvba continuing to innovate while maintaining a strong cultural identity. Mexican indie rock gained greater visibility internationally, thanks in part to streaming platforms and festivals like Vive Latino and Corona Capital, which provided exposure for both new and established artists. In the 2020s, the scene further diversified, with artists exploring a mix of genres, including bedroom pop, alt-pop, and lo-fi music. Bands like Siddhartha, Ximena Sariñana, and Girl Ultra helped bring Mexican indie rock into the mainstream while embracing global trends like electronic music and R&amp;B. As streaming platforms and social media became even more influential, the Mexican indie rock scene continued to grow, reaching a wider audience and establishing itself as a significant force in the global music landscape.

==Modern rock==

The 2000s also saw the emergence of a new generation of Mexican alternative and indie rock musicians. Alternative groups and artists such as Motel, Reik, Allison, Panda, Hello Seahorse!, División Minúscula, Zoé, Natalia Lafourcade, and Insite have received mainstream success in Mexico and throughout Latin America.

The indie music scene in Mexico has produced bands such as Porter, Austin TV, Animal Gang, The Copper Gamins, inspired by The White Stripes, from more remote central Mexico, Los Dynamite, Chikita Violenta, Los Jaigüey, Secret Agent, Bengala, and Hello Seahorse!, who often write lyrics in English and have toured alongside American indie rock bands throughout Latin America and the United States.

Popular electronic music and synthpop groups include Moenia, Belanova, Jotdog, Sussie 4, Hocico, Amduscia and The Nortec Collective.

<doc id="1233360" wikidata="Q988514" url="?curid=1233360" title="Eisenacher Motorenwerk">
<text>Eisenacher Motorenwerk (EMW) was an East German manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles based in Eisenach. EMW also entered Formula One as a constructor in 1953, but participated in only one race, the 1953 German Grand Prix. The car retired after 12 laps with exhaust problems.

==Continuing BMW production==

One of the pre-World War II BMW factories was located in Eisenach, which after the war was taken over by the Soviets, since Eisenach was situated in the Soviet occupation zone. The factory continued producing cars and motorcycles under the BMW brand, but after a lawsuit in 1952 they had to change the name to EMW instead. The logotype was also similar, but instead of the blue BMW used, EMW used red.

The Kasernierte Volkspolizei (a paramilitary police branch which preceded the National People&#x27;s Army) and the succeeding East German armed forces needed vehicles and expressed interest in reviving production of the BMW 325, an unsuccessful wartime off-road &quot;Einheits-PKW&quot; (standardized military light utility vehicle) built by BMW in Eisenach. This was developed into the new EMW 325/3, of which 166 were built in 1952. This remilitarization, however, was in violation of the terms of the Potsdam Conference and led to protests from the West.

==New designs==
Later the automobile section of EMW became VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach and built the Wartburg. Motorcycle manufacture ended in the 1950s and was replaced by the AWO 425 built by Simson at Suhl.

<doc id="1233365" wikidata="Q16748934" url="?curid=1233365" title="Pelmorex">
<text>Pelmorex Corp. is a Canadian weather information and media company. Based in Oakville, Ontario, it is the owner of the Canadian specialty channels The Weather Network (English) and MétéoMédia (French), and their associated digital properties.

Founded in 1989, &quot;Pelmorex&quot; is a portmanteau derived from the name of the company&#x27;s chairman and controlling shareholder, Pierre L. Morrissette.

== History ==
Pelmorex Corp. was established in 1989 and acquired The Weather Network and MeteoMedia shortly after. The brand grew in Canada and in 1996, The Weather Channel in the United States was brought on board as a strategic minority shareholder.

In the early 1990s, the company owned the Pelmorex Radio Network stations in Northern Ontario. The company sold the stations in 1998 and 1999, to Telemedia and Haliburton Broadcasting Group respectively.

In 2006, Pelmorex purchased the operations of World Weatherwatch, a meteorological service company with clients such as the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, Hydro One and Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

In 2012, Pelmorex acquired the Spanish weather website eltiempo.es, where it focused on bolstering its digital and marketing operations, and hiring prominent local personality José Antonio Maldonado. It also acquired the traffic information provider Beat the Traffic. In 2013, Ron Close became the new president and CEO of the company. The company also began to plot out further expansion in Europe, Latin America, and the United States, as well as optimization of digital advertising delivery based on weather data.

In 2015, Pelmorex bought out The Weather Channel&#x27;s 49% stake in the company.

== Public alerting ==

In 2001, Pelmorex first proposed that an emergency population warning system, &quot;All Channel Alert&quot;, be implemented by all television providers, using proprietary Pelmorex hardware and funded primarily via an increase in carriage fees for The Weather Network/MétéoMédia. The CRTC rejected the proposal, citing the need to consult with the industry over design, costs, and governance of the system.

In 2010, Pelmorex established a &quot;national aggregator and distributor&quot; (NAAD) of localized emergency alert messages compliant with the Common Alerting Protocol as a condition of a request for must-carry status for the two channels. It is governed by representatives of the broadcasting industry, the federal government, members of the Senior Officials Responsible for Emergency Management (SOREM), and the Canadian Association for Public Alerting and Notification. In 2011, the CRTC renewed the must-carry status, under the condition that Pelmorex allow all federal, provincial and territorial emergency management officials to have access to the system, that it commit at least $1 million per-year on public awareness campaigns, and that it develop &quot;broadcast-intrusive&quot; alerts. On August 29, 2014, the CRTC ruled that all over-the-air television channels, radio stations, and television providers must begin relaying emergency messages relayed via NAAD beginning March 31, 2015; Pelmorex markets this under the public-facing brand &quot;Alert Ready&quot; (French: &quot;En Alerte&quot;). Beginning April 2018, emergency alerts also became mandatory on mobile phones.

<text>KMTV-TV (channel 3) is a television station in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, affiliated with CBS. Owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, the station has studios on Mockingbird Drive in southwest Omaha, and its transmitter is located on a &quot;tower farm&quot; near North 72nd Street and Crown Point Avenue in north-central Omaha. It also doubles as a secondary CBS station in the Platte Purchase area (northern portions of the St. Joseph, Missouri, television market) alongside local affiliate KCJO-LD.

==History==
KMTV began broadcasting on September 1, 1949, as the second oldest television station in Nebraska. It operated as a CBS affiliate, but carried secondary affiliations with ABC and the DuMont Television Network. The station&#x27;s call letters were originally intended to be KMA-TV, reflecting its first owner, Shenandoah, Iowa–based May Broadcasting, which owned KMA (960 AM) in that community. However, this violated Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, which at the time required stations have the same or adjacent city of license in order to share a base call sign. The station originally operated from studios located at 2615 Farnam Street in downtown Omaha, seven blocks east of WOW-TV (channel 6, now WOWT, at 3501 Farnam).

KMTV briefly dropped ABC programming when KFOR-TV signed on from Lincoln in 1953. The network returned to KMTV when the FCC separated Lincoln to form its own market a year later. In 1956, KMTV switched affiliations with WOW-TV and became an NBC affiliate. This was part of CBS&#x27; multi-year, five-station affiliation deal with Meredith Corporation, as a compensation for Phoenix sister station KPHO to lose affiliation with network (KCMO-AM-FM-TV also switched to the network several months earlier). It also lost DuMont programming that same year when that network ceased operations. In September 1957, KMTV dropped its secondary ABC affiliation when KETV signed on as an exclusive affiliate of the network, from studios on Douglas Street just north of channel 3&#x27;s facility. A sister station agreement with TV Shizuoka from Japan was signed in 1974.

In 1978, KMTV relocated to its current studio facilities near 108th and Mockingbird Drive; the station&#x27;s auxiliary transmitter remains at the station&#x27;s former studio location. In 1986, KMTV and WOWT entered into an agreement which allowed them to return to their original affiliations; as a result, KMTV rejoined CBS after 30 years with NBC on June 29, 1986. A few months after returning to CBS, May sold both of its television stations—KMTV and KGUN-TV in Tucson, Arizona—to Lee Enterprises after over 37 years of ownership. Lee sold its entire broadcasting division, including KMTV, to Emmis Communications in October 2000. In 2005, Emmis announced its exit from television station ownership to concentrate on its radio station properties, selling most non-license assets of KMTV as well as outright ownership of KGUN to the Journal Broadcast Group. The sale closed in late December of that year. At that point, Journal took over control of KMTV through a time brokerage agreement.

In late January 2007, Journal announced the sale of radio station KOMJ (1490 AM) to Cochise Broadcasting LLC, in order to purchase KMTV outright. The sale of KOMJ was necessary because Journal already owned the maximum number of broadcasting properties in the Omaha media market as designated by the FCC. The transactions were completed on March 27, 2007.
As of July 2013 within a month-long dispute between Journal and Time Warner Cable, KMTV was removed from the Time Warner system in Lincoln and replaced by GSN, and KOLN was solidified as the only CBS affiliate on that system.

On July 30, 2014, it was announced that The E. W. Scripps Company would acquire Journal Communications in an all-stock transaction. The combined firm will retain their broadcast properties, including KMTV, and spin off their print assets as Journal Media Group. The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014. It was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015. The merger was completed on April 1, 2015.

==Programming==
KMTV formerly served as the Omaha &quot;Love Network&quot; affiliate of the &quot;MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;, until the organization&#x27;s 2013 move from a syndicated broadcast to a network telecast on ABC.

&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; both formerly ran on KMTV, which respectively carried the game shows at 4:30 and 6:30 p.m. weekdays until &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; moved to WOWT and &quot;Wheel&quot; moved to KETV, both in September 1994 (&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; initially ran on KETV from 1984 to 1986, when it moved to KMTV; it began airing &quot;Wheel&quot; in January 1984). &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot; also aired on KMTV (as far back as the &quot;Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; era) until 2012, when the show moved to Fox affiliate KPTM.

The station also ran a long-running children&#x27;s religious show that debuted in 1961 called &quot;Ms. Jean&#x27;s Storytime&quot;, which ended in September 2011 after a 50-year run.

In August 2012, the station began carrying Green Bay Packers preseason football games, as part the team&#x27;s &quot;official broadcaster&quot; deal with Journal, which in addition to owning KMTV and WTMJ, also owns Green Bay&#x27;s WGBA-TV, a deal which continues under Scripps ownership.

===News operation===
KMTV presently broadcasts 29 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). For most of the time since the early 1960s, KMTV has been the third rated station in the Omaha market.

Over the years, KMTV underwent many identity changes to keep up with broadcasting trends, as well to keep up in the local ratings race. The station&#x27;s newscasts were once known as &quot;KMTV News&quot;; &quot;NewsCenter 3&quot;; &quot;Channel 3 News&quot;; &quot;KMTV News 3&quot;; &quot;KM3 News&quot;; and most recently as &quot;Action 3 News&quot;; today, the station&#x27;s newscasts are known as &quot;3 News Now&quot;. Former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw worked at the station as a reporter from 1962 to 1965.

In 2002, KMTV discontinued its 6 p.m. newscast and replaced it with syndicated tabloid programs. That same year, sports segments were dropped from the 10 p.m. newscast, and were replaced with a nightly commentary segment called &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; that was presented by then-sports director Travis Justice. In late 2005, KMTV discontinued &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, returning to the traditional sports segment.

KMTV returned a newscast to the 6 p.m. timeslot on September 5, 2006, coinciding with Katie Couric&#x27;s debut as anchor of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. The station has also taken on the glossy imaging and graphics packages seen on most other Journal stations, though with differing fonts and colors. On December 22, 2006, the station announced it would not be renewing the contracts of evening news anchors Deborah Ward and Greg Peterson; the two were replaced by Carol Wang and Carlo Cecchetto on January 22, 2007.

On July 11, 2009, KMTV became the first commercial television station in Omaha, and the second commercial station in the state of Nebraska (after KOLN and PBS member station NET, both in Lincoln) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in 16:9 widescreen standard definition. In October 2013, KMTV became the third commercial station in Omaha (after WOWT and KPTM) to broadcast its newscasts in high definition.

In late 2013 and early 2014, KMTV added one and one-half hours worth of new news programming. On July 15, 2013, KMTV announced that it would launch a weekday half-hour 4 p.m. newscast; the program made its debut September 23, 2013, the newscast was then expanded to an hour. In January 2014 KMTV began broadcasting an early morning show focused on weather. &quot;Early Riser&quot; runs from 4:30 a.m. to 5 a.m. and features Ryan McPike covering the weather for the upcoming day. The station&#x27;s 4 p.m. newscast became &quot;Upfront at 4&quot; with the 2015–16 season, its first full season under Scripps ownership.

On March 8, 2017, KMTV introduced a new virtual set and re-branded its newscasts as &quot;3 News Now&quot;. The station also switched to the standard Scripps graphics package and Stephen Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Inergy&quot; music package to match other Scripps sister stations.

In January 2019, KMTV slashed at least half of its newscast schedule. The noon newscast was dropped to make way for &quot;Right This Minute&quot;, one of Scripps&#x27; original co-productions; the hour-long 4 p.m. newscast was also dropped to make way for &quot;The List&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;; the 5 p.m. newscast became a mix of local and national stories and was renamed &quot;The NOW Omaha&quot;; the weeknight 6 p.m. newscast was expanded to a full hour; and the early-evening weekend half-hour newscasts on Saturdays at 6 p.m. and on Sundays at 5:30 p.m. were discontinued in favor of syndicated programming. As of May 2020, a traditional newscast has returned to the weekday 5 p.m. slot and the half-hour noon newscast has been reinstated.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

KMTV was the last television station in the market to begin carrying a digital subchannel; digital subchannel 3.2 was originally affiliated with TheCoolTV starting in late 2010 or early 2011, but dropped the network on October 1, 2011, in favor of Live Well Network as part of a compensation dispute between Journal Broadcast Group and TheCoolTV&#x27;s parent company Cool Music Network, LLC. In turn, Antenna TV took LWN&#x27;s place on December 29, 2014.

In late 2021, Grit and Court TV switched places at 3.2 and 3.5.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 45, using virtual channel 3. Although KMTV never had a &quot;-TV&quot; suffix affixed to its call sign from the beginning, it (along with other Journal-owned television stations which previously did not have a &quot;-TV&quot; suffix in their calls) officially added one to the callsign on June 19.

<text>Charles William James Keeping (22 September 1924 – 16 May 1988) was an English illustrator, children&#x27;s book author and lithographer. He made the illustrations for Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s historical novels for children, and he created more than twenty picture books. He also illustrated the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society.

Keeping won two Kate Greenaway Medals from the Library Association for the best children&#x27;s book illustration of the year, for his own story &quot;Charley, Charlotte and the Golden Canary&quot; (1967) and for a new edition (1981) of Alfred Noyes&#x27;s poem &quot;The Highwayman&quot;. For the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955–2005), a panel named his edition of &quot;The Highwayman&quot; one of the top ten winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation&#x27;s favourite. He also illustrated &quot;The God Beneath the Sea&quot;, by Leon Garfield and Edward Blishen, which won the 1970 Carnegie Medal for children&#x27;s literature. For his contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator Keeping was a runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1974.

His lithographs have been exhibited in London, Italy, Austria and the U.S., including at the 1958 Fifth International Biennial of Contemporary Color Lithography in Cincinnati. He has prints in many collections, including at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==Early life==
Charles Keeping was born and grew up in Lambeth, London, in a terraced house that housed three generations. He lived in an inner city environment of street markets and working horses that would inform his work his entire life. Charles and his elder sister, Grace, drew and made up stories from an early age, on surplus newsstand placards brought home by their father, Charles Keeping senior, who distributed newspapers to shops and newsstands in the area and boxed under the name Charlie Clarke. He later described his upbringing as &quot;comfortable working class&quot;.

He attended the Frank Bryant School for Boys in Kennington, North London, leaving at the minimum age of 14, after which two of his aunts paid for him to take a correspondence course in art. He took a job with the book printing company William Clowes &amp; Sons, and after the outbreak of the Second World War joined Durrants, an engineering company producing munitions. He also spent some time working as a gasman. In 1942, when he turned 18, he joined the Royal Navy as a wireless operator, serving four years.

He returned to civilian life in 1946 with a profound depression and a belief that a head wound he had sustained had disfigured him on the inside as well as (temporarily) on the outside, and would cause him to turn evil like Dr Jekyll becoming Mr Hyde. He received treatment, was institutionalised for a time, and made a full recovery, but perhaps his sympathetic visual treatment of Grendel, the monster from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, owes something to this period of his life.

He applied for a grant to study art at the Regent Street Polytechnic, but was initially turned down, so he read meters for a gas company during the day and took art classes in the evening. He finally got his grant and studied full-time from 1949 to 1952, completing the two-year Intermediate Examination in six months before specialising in illustration and lithography. His teachers included illustrators Stuart Tresilian and Nigel Lambourne, and lithographer Henry Trivick. In 1957 his lithograph &quot;Clerks and Ponies&quot; was included as one of the &#x27;Young Artists of Promise&#x27; in Jack Beddington&#x27;s book. He also worked as a life model, and on one such occasion in 1949 his demonstration of the functions of the muscles of the back attracted the eye of Renate Meyer, a fellow student who had left Germany with her family in 1933. They married in 1952 and four children.

==Career==

===Early work===
Keeping went freelance after graduation, and spent four years drawing a comic strip for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, but did not enjoy the editorial restrictions he had to work under. He also drew cartoons for the &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Middle Eastern Review&quot;, and, later, &quot;Punch&quot;, and his first book commission was a series of cartoon illustrations for a humorous health-promotion book called &quot;Why Die of Heart Disease?&quot; in 1953. He also did some work in advertising, and illustrated some educational textbooks.

===Children&#x27;s books===

In 1956 he began to work through the artist&#x27;s agent B. L. Kearley Ltd, whose rep Patsy Lambe referred him to Mabel George, editor of children&#x27;s books at Oxford University Press. George commissioned him to illustrate Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s historical children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Silver Branch&quot;. He was unenthused by the ancient Roman subject matter, but experimented with double page spreads and drawings in the margins, and was quickly assigned more books by Sutcliff and others, including Henry Treece. This began a professional relationship with Oxford University Press, for whom he illustrated more books than for any other publisher. Keeping, along with Victor Ambrus, established a new, exuberant style of illustration for children&#x27;s historical fiction, refusing to shy away from the violence of warfare.

Leon Garfield and Edward Blishen&#x27;s retelling of Greek myths, &quot;The God Beneath the Sea&quot;, which Keeping illustrated in 1970, won the Carnegie Medal for that year.

From the later 1960s Keeping, alongside illustrators like Brian Wildsmith and John Burningham, took advantage of advances in printing technology to move from black and white work to adventurous colour techniques. In 1966 he created his first full-colour picture books, &quot;Black Dolly&quot; and &quot;Sean and the Carthorse&quot;, both about mistreated working horses. He followed these with &quot;Charley, Charlotte and the Golden Canary&quot;, a modern fairy tale about two children who grow up in the same street, are separated when one family moves to a new tower block, and are reunited thanks to a pet canary, which depicts the gradual disappearance of the London of Keeping&#x27;s childhood, a theme he would persistently revisit. The full-colour illustrations are messy and spontaneous, using intense colour, sponge texturing and wax resist, and won Keeping his first Greenaway Medal. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; concluded a very short review, &quot;Intense colors in striking combinations overwhelm the minimal story.&quot;

Keeping created 15 full-colour picture books for Oxford University Press, and several for other publishers. &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Yard&quot; (1969) and &quot;Through the Window&quot; (1970), two of his finest, were also produced as short films for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Storyline&quot; programme. &quot;Through the Window&quot; in particular showcases many of Keeping&#x27;s techniques and themes. Told through the eyes of a small boy watching events in the street outside from his bedroom window, the illustrations are full of intense evening light and colour, movement, and even, when a horse-drawn dray rattles across a double-page spread, virtual sound. Other picture books include &quot;Richard&quot; (1973), about a day in the life of a police horse; &quot;Wasteground Circus&quot; (1975), on the transient but magical effect on two young boys of the circus coming to town; and &quot;Willie&#x27;s Fire Engine&quot; (1980), a romantic, dreamlike tale of a young Edinburgh boy&#x27;s dream of being a firefighter.

In the 1980s Oxford University Press created a new format for Keeping - the black and white picture book for older children. Keeping created four books in this format: &quot;The Highwayman&quot; (1981), illustrating the 1906 poem by Alfred Noyes in gruesome detail, for which he won his second Greenaway Medal; &quot;Beowulf&quot; (1982), adapted from the Anglo-Saxon epic by Kevin Crossley-Holland, in which the illustrations subverted the text with a certain sympathy for the monster; &quot;The Wedding Ghost&quot; (1985), an original story by Leon Garfield; and &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; (1986), illustrating the 1833/1842 Arthurian poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. All were illustrated in evocative line and wash. The influence of Swedish illustrator John Bauer can most clearly be seen on &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Keeping continued to produce colour picture books from time to time, including &quot;Railway Passage&quot;, which was Highly Commended for the 1974 Greenaway Medal; &quot;Sammy Streetsinger&quot; (1984), about a subway busker&#x27;s rise to fame as a pop star and subsequent return to happy obscurity; and his final book, &quot;Adam and Paradise Island&quot;, another story of the changing landscape of London, which was published posthumously in 1989.

===Classic fiction===
In 1964 Keeping illustrated his first book for the Folio Society, an edition of Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. He disliked the book, finding the characters unconvincing, and so illustrated them in two-colour lithographs in an expressionist style, paying little attention to the faces. He had been contracted for twelve illustrations, but delivered twenty-two, and asked the publisher to choose the twelve best. He followed this with Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1966) in a similar style. For the same publisher he illustrated &quot;Ghost Stories of M. R. James&quot; (1973), Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1976) and Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2 volumes, 1976) in two-colour lithographs, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1971) in line drawings.

Beginning in 1978 with &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, Keeping took on the mammoth task of illustrating the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society. His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect man for the job. The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing, meaning the illustrations must be pure line drawings with no tones or washes. When they came to be published more modern printing techniques were used which would have allowed Keeping a full range of tones, but he had started with line drawings, so he used the same technique for the entire series, illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; in 1988.

He also worked for another publisher of classic fiction, the Geneva-based Heron Books, for whom he illustrated works by Wilkie Collins, Joseph Conrad, Aldous Huxley, W. Somerset Maugham, Nevil Shute, Robert Louis Stevenson and H. G. Wells.

===Other book illustration===
In 1975 Keeping produced perhaps his most personal work, &quot;Cockney Ding Dong&quot;, a lavish 190-page volume collecting and illustrating the traditional songs of the family singalongs of his childhood. A record of some the songs was also released, featuring the voices of members of Keeping&#x27;s family. Charles himself sings &quot;They&#x27;re Moving Father&#x27;s Grave to Build a Sewer!&quot;

===Teaching===
At the invitation of Henry Trivick, Keeping continued to use the printing presses at Regent Street Polytechnic after his graduation, and from 1956 to 1963 he lectured there one day a week. From 1963 he was a visiting lecturer at Croydon College of Art, initially in illustration, and after 1979 in lithography. His students included Fiona French.

==Personal life==

Charles Keeping died of a brain tumour on 16 May 1988. His widow, Renate, ran the Keeping Gallery, displaying his and her own work for many years. She died in 2014.

==Reception==
Keeping&#x27;s work was controversial in some quarters. Some felt his work too flashy, and illustrator Edward Ardizzone is said to have referred to him as &quot;that vulgar artist&quot;. Others felt that the frankness and violence of his work, and his taste for the morbid and macabre, were unsuitable for children. His biographer has commented,

Keeping&#x27;s former editor Mabel George said of him, &quot;I have always had a strong feeling that Charles was a true genius... it is my belief that he came to maturity very slowly (not in terms of technique, at which he was a master from his earliest days) but from the point of view of his self-confidence as an artist. ... he was all the time growing and developing as a man whose whole life, heart and mind, was dedicated to exploring the human situation in a universe that he found both beautiful and terrifying.&quot; His former teacher and fellow illustrator Nigel Lambourne has described him as &quot;one of the few &quot;great&quot; illustrators we&#x27;ve got. A superb draughtsman, and he had – for all his marvellously brash, outgoing manner – an ability to tear up purposively anything that didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

==Awards==
The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Keeping was one of three runners-up for the illustration award in 1974 and was the British nominee again in 1978. He won a Golden Apple award at the Biennial of Illustration Bratislava in 1975.

He won several awards for particular books.

* 1967 Kate Greenaway Medal, &quot;Charley, Charlotte and the Golden Canary&quot;, written by Keeping
* 1972 Francis Williams Award for Illustration, &quot;Tinker Tailor: Folk Song Tales&quot; (New York: World), tunes &quot;arranged for voice and piano by K. Neil Slater&quot; (WorldCat)

* 1988 W H Smith Illustration Award, &quot;Charles Keeping&#x27;s Classic Tales of the Macabre&quot;, written by various authors

Keeping was also a runner-up for at least three Greenaway Medals, which then recognised the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book illustration by a British subject:
* 1969, &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Yard&quot;, written by himself 
* 1970, &quot;The God Beneath the Sea&quot;, written by Edward Blishen and Leon Garfield (who jointly won the annual British Carnegie Medal)
* 1974, &quot;Railway Passage&quot; (Oxford), written by himself

&quot;Railway Passage&quot; was the first runner up &quot;Highly Commended&quot; for the Medal. Both distinctions were abandoned after 2002.

<doc id="1233382" wikidata="Q586041" url="?curid=1233382" title="Connew">
<text>Connew Racing Team, commonly known as Connew (), was a short lived British Formula One constructor. Founded in 1971 by Peter Connew, the team constructed a single car, the PC1. The first monococque had to be aborted due to a change in regulations and the second tub was known as PC2. However, record books show the car driven by Migault and others as PC1. The intent was to compete in the Formula One World Championship in 1972, but a lack of financial and technical resources meant that the car only managed to start in one championship race, the 1972 Austrian Grand Prix, with French driver François Migault at the wheel. Following the Austrian race, the car competed in a handful of non-championship races before being converted to meet Formula 5000 specifications for the 1973 season. The chassis was damaged beyond repair during the season finale at Brands Hatch and the team closed.
==History==
In 1969, at the age of 23, Peter Connew was asked by a friend if he wanted to attend the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Connew&#x27;s employer refused to give him time off to attend the race, so he resigned and travelled to the race anyway. Upon returning Connew needed employment and was hired by Surtees, a Formula One team run by former champion John Surtees, as a draughtsman.

===1972: Formula One===
After a falling out with team principal John Surtees, Connew left the team to pursue designing his own car. A garage was rented in Chadwell Heath and the initial construction of the chassis jig began in December 1970. Connew was assisted by Roger Doran, who worked as a shopfitter, and Connew&#x27;s cousin Barry Boor.

Connew&#x27;s design philosophy was that whilst the car should be efficient, it should also be easy to work on and maintain. The Connew design was tested and refined by utilising a wind tunnel of a local technical college. During the build, drivers Tony Trimmer, Howden Ganley and Gerry Birrell all came to view the car, with Trimmer stating it to be one of the most comfortable cars he had ever sat in.

The team planned to make their racing debut at the Monaco Grand Prix, but a sudden rule change required the construction of another chassis in a different type of aluminium. In the meantime, Connew made a deal with McLaren to purchase a second hand Cosworth DFV engine. Frenchman François Migault signed a deal to drive for the team and also provided a Ford truck, which carried the car to France. The truck broke down before it could get to the Clermont-Ferrand circuit, the location of the French Grand Prix and instead the team tested at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans.

The car finally took part in practice for the 1972 British Grand Prix but was withdrawn before the race. The car had an unusual rear suspension which proved not to be up to the job. It was taken back to the workshop and repaired overnight, but upon loading the next day, a rear upright was found to be cracked and it was withdrawn.

The small team also managed to show up at the 1972 German Grand Prix, but without having made a proper prior entry, participation was denied by the race officials.

The car was modified and entered in the 1972 Austrian Grand Prix. Migault qualified at the end of the field despite some engine troubles. After 22 laps, Migault had passed four competitors, but a rear wishbone mounting point failed and Migault had a nasty moment. The car swerved towards the barriers on the start/finish straight, but the driver brought the car safely to a halt without damage.

The Connew reappeared at the end of season World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch with David Purley driving but did not start because of electrical problems. Purley had asked for an electrical &quot;kill&quot; switch to be fitted to the steering wheel, but on the warm-up lap this malfunctioned, the engine stopped and the car was retired.

===1973: Formula 5000===
The car was modified to meet Formula 5000 regulations and appeared in the European Formula 5000 Championship in 1973, fitted with a Chevrolet V8 engine. The car made its first outing in the series at Mallory Park for round 10 of 18. Swiss driver Pierre Soukry qualified the car in twenty-first place, but was unable to start due to a split oil pipe. Three races later, the Connew failed to qualify at Brands Hatch, with Soukry at the wheel. The car&#x27;s final appearance was at the season finale, again at Brands Hatch. Tony Trimmer drove but a collision with a barrier put the chassis beyond repair.

<text>Jing&#x27;an Temple (; historically Bubbling Well Temple) is an esoteric Tangmi Buddhist temple on West Nanjing Road (historically Nanking or Bubbling Well Road in English) in Shanghai. 

==History==
The original temple was first built in 247 AD in the Wu Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China. Originally located beside the Suzhou Creek, it was relocated to the Jing&#x27;an site in 1216 during the Song dynasty. The temple was rebuilt in the Qing dynasty but, during the Cultural Revolution, the temple was razed and turned into a plastic factory. In 1983, the site was returned to its original purpose and the temple rebuilt. Over the years, the temple has been expanded, with the Jing&#x27;an Pagoda being completed in 2010. In 1953, Master Chisong (釋持松), a renowned Republican monk who had been initiated into the Shingon sect and trained as an acharya, was appointed abbot of the temple. He reestablished the temple under the Tangmi Buddhist tradition and enshrined the Mandala of the Two Realms within the temple. In contemporary times, the temple still officially practices Tangmi Buddhism. On December 19, 2009, a 15-ton silver statue of Buddha Rudra cast in pure silver was installed in Jing&#x27;an Temple. More than ten 3-ton silver statues of the Bodhisattva and the disciples were added to the Daxiongbao Hall.

==Features==
Three Southern-style halls, each with its own courtyard, dating from the most recent reconstruction (1880):
* Hall of Heavenly Kings
* Hall of the Three Saints
* Hall of Virtuous Works
* The Mahavira Hall (&quot;Precious Hall of the Great Hero&quot;), the main hall
* To the east of the main hall is the Guanyin Hall. In the center of the hall is a statue of the goddess made out of camphor wood. Standing on a lotus-shaped base, it is 6.2 meters tall and weighs 5 metric tons
* Opposite the hall is the Jade Buddha Hall, where a 3.8-meter jade Buddha sits in the center. It is the largest sitting jade Buddha statue in the country
* Abbot&#x27;s Chambers
* Ming Dynasty copper bell (Hongwu Bell), weighing 3.5 tons
* Stone Buddhas from the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420-589 AD)
* Paintings by master painters, Chu Zhishan, Zhang Daqian and Wen Zhenming
*Mandalas enshrined at a tantric altar on the upper floor

==Transportation==
The temple sits on top of the Jing&#x27;an Temple Station, a major hub of the Shanghai Metro network where Line 2 and Line 7 intersect.

You can take Bus No.113, 40, 830, 824, 20, 15, 37, 21 to arrive Jing&#x27;an Temple.

There are also Shuttle Express Service provided from airports to Jing&#x27;an Temple. Pudong Airport Shuttle Bus Line No. 2 run from City Terminal (beside Jing&#x27;an Temple)

<text>Behra-Porsche was a Formula One constructor which entered four World Championship Grands Prix across the 1959 and 1960 seasons. The constructor started - and finished - two races, both in the 1960 season, but scored no championship points in the process.

Jean Behra was a French racing driver, who by the end of the 1950s was a stalwart of the Formula One paddock. He had achieved success earlier in the decade with the Maserati team, but was contracted to Ferrari for the 1959 season. Despite his obligations to Ferrari, Behra commissioned Porsche to build a Formula 2 single-seater car, taking componentry from the Porsche 718 &#x27;RSK&#x27;. The chassis for the car had already been designed by former Maserati engineer Valerio Colotti, who subsequently adapted it so that components from the 718 RSK could be used. The vehicle was named the &#x27;Behra-Porsche&#x27; and painted in the Bleu de France colour of the Frenchman&#x27;s homeland.

The car made an initial outing at the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix, with Behra&#x27;s good friend Maria Teresa de Filippis at the wheel. De Filippis was unable to qualify, however, and the car did not start the race.

After the French Grand Prix, Behra was dismissed from the Ferrari team following an altercation with the team manager. This meant, however, that Behra was able to race the Behra-Porsche himself in the upcoming German Grand Prix.

The German Grand Prix was the only one ever to be held at the AVUS circuit in Berlin. Not only had Behra entered the Behra-Porsche into the Grand Prix, he had also entered his RSK sportscar into a support race. It was in this race that Behra crashed fatally, spinning out over the top of the infamous AVUS banking and being thrown from his vehicle. Behra hit a flagpole and fell to the ground, fracturing his skull and breaking many ribs. It was concluded by a doctor on the scene that he died on impact.

Following Behra&#x27;s death, the Behra-Porsche was acquired by Lloyd Casner for the Camoradi International team. The first of the Behra-Porsche&#x27;s two outings in 1960 was in the Argentine Grand Prix on 7 February. Masten Gregory took 12th place in the race, four laps behind the leader. Towards the latter half of the season, Fred Gamble became the last driver to pilot the Behra-Porsche in a World Championship Grand Prix. The 1960 Italian Grand Prix, which was noted for a boycott by the three British teams, saw Gamble take 10th place. He was the last finisher, nine laps down on the leader.

<doc id="1233393" wikidata="Q3437873" url="?curid=1233393" title="Peruvian rock">
<text>Rock music entered the Peruvian scene in the late 1950s, through listening to performers like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Bill Haley, who popularized rockabilly in the United States. The first Peruvian rock bands appeared during this time. They included Los Millonarios del Jazz, Los Stars, Conjunto Astoria, Los Incas Modernos, and Los Zodiacs.

== History ==

=== 1960s ===
New trends like British Merseybeat and American surf became popular, and a number of Peruvian bands built a loyal audience. Los Saicos blended psychedelic rock, garage rock and surf. Los Shains featured rock guitar hero (later in Pax). Traffic Sound, the first Peruvian supergroup, merged core players from Los Hang Ten&#x27;s with other important musicians. Also popular were Los York&#x27;s, Los Jaguars, Los Silvertons, Los Belkings and Los Doltons.

=== 1970s ===
After the military coup in October 1968, rock music was branded an alienating phenomenon by the government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. There was a ban of concerts in key venues including a highly anticipated Carlos Santana concert in 1971. However, some AM radio stations continued to play rock music (such as Radio Miraflores, Radio 1160, and Radio Atalaya). Also, record companies continued to release LPs of rock bands (such as Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix) in Peru. The movie &quot;Woodstock&quot; was shown in Lima every two or three years. Moreover, some bands left their mark, such as El Polen, Traffic Sound, Pax, We All Together, Telegraph Avenue, Black Sugar, Crossroads, Tripping Foxters, Red Amber (the first Peruvian progressive rock band), and Fragil (in the late 1970s). In the late 1970s, the band Breeze with Roxana Valdivieso released a self-titled album with English lyrics.

Peruvian rock descended into its most obscure era during the mid-1970s, losing the momentum it had laboriously gained. Disco and salsa dominated the airwaves for the remainder of the decade. Some rock musicians became jazz musicians, such as guitarist Richie Zellon.

=== 1980s ===

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Peruvian rock bands were confined to the underground scene; with no radio or TV support. The half-hour TV show Disco Club led by singer-songwriter Gerardo Manuel (Rojas) was an occasional exception. Fragil released its first LP in 1981. Nevertheless, because of the deep crisis that the country was suffering, Peruvian rockers looked for a way to channel their frustrations. In this environment, it is no surprise that British punk rock became a major influence to a few young Peruvians rockers of this era, and quickly a small &quot;underground&quot; scene started brewing parallel to the free-again &#x27;mainstream&#x27; scene. Bands like Leusemia, Narcosis, Autopsia, Guerrilla Urbana, Zcuela Crrada formed part of the first wave. The members of these bands were mostly from poor neighborhoods, but a few came from upper-class neighborhoods and had learned English in their schools.

Bands like Fragil, Rio, Miki Gonzales, Pax, JAS, Imagenes, Trama, Danai y Pateandolatas came from upper and middle-class backgrounds, uncovering the social division in Peruvian society. According to some scholars (mainly left-wing thinkers), the &#x27;underground&#x27; scene was by far richer in creativity, though lacking technical skills; others thought the &#x27;commercial&#x27; scene was more worthwhile, since the underground scene only reached a few hundred supporters per concert and was focused in the capital of Lima, being virtually unknown to the rest of the country.

Quickly several bands started appearing and creating subgenres within the umbrella &#x27;underground&#x27; scene. Radio or TV support was nonexistent for them (the mainstream bands did have some), poverty and lack of technology prevented most bands from recording any moderate-quality material. Despite all this, the present and future looked much brighter than in the 1970s, since these bands, especially the mainstream ones, were pioneers in the rock scene after the 1975–1985 downturn.

At the same time, an underground scene of death metal and black metal developed in Lima, influenced by European bands. Local bands such as Mortem and Kranium were formed in the 1980s.

=== 1990s ===
The further growth of the underground scene and the liberalization of Peruvian society and economy allowed rock musicians to create sub-circuits, and rock became very diverse. Some of the best (but not necessarily best known) rock bands from Peru came out during this decade. Leusemia became the leaders of not only the &#x27;underground&#x27; faction, but of all Peruvian rock, undergoing a change from very basic rock band to a prolific and influential group that included rock anthems, ballads and symphonic, almost progressive rock. For those who liked the 1980s post-punk, Dolores Delirio, Voz Propia and Cardenales were among the best at the goth sound.

Huelga De Hambre was one of Peru&#x27;s grunge-influenced group. El Aire, G3, Arcana, Radio Criminal, Los Mojarras, Mar De Copas, La Liga del Sueño and Rafo Raez were very solid bands of diverse genres that were followed in the late 1990s by La Sarita, Ni Voz Ni Voto, Cementerio Club, D&#x27;Mente Comun and Líbido, greatly expanding rock music in Peru.

Due to financial difficulties and lack of support from promoters, most bands had to play the same few venues, where they build loyal and knowledgeable fanbases. Although the concerts were very small at the beginning (typically 50 people), as the decade progressed, more young people started to notice these bands and fill bigger venues with 500, 1000, or 2000 people. Towards the end of the decade, major concerts like &quot;Acustirock&quot;, &quot;El Niño Malo&quot;, &quot;Antimiseria&quot; and &quot;Inrockuptibles&quot; each brought in at least 10,000 fans.

Peruvian media began to pay attention to these bands in the late 1990s, giving exposure to bands of a decidedly more upper-class and &#x27;safer&#x27; sounding rock. The most prominent bands of &#x27;mainstream&#x27; 1990s Peruvian rock were Nosequien y Los Nosecuantos, Miki Gonzales and Arena Hash. From this last band, Pedro Suárez-Vértiz went on a solo career and became the most commercially successful Peruvian rocker of the decade.

The black metal and death metal scene remained an underground, with a few bands releasing self-produced material. Bands included black-metal acts Illapa, Belzec, and Nahual; and death-thrash metal acts like Dark Silence, Ensalve, and Hadez. Many conflicts between bands (which include trash-talking and rivalries) and critical political and economic issues led to the breakup of many metal groups.

A report on Peruvian rock included in the July 1999 issue of &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; mentions the following bands: Aeropajitas, Manganzoides, 60s garage punk/garage revival, Asmereir, a blend of punk/ska/reggae/hardcore/thrash, Leusemia, that put out a double CD through Coyote Records titled &quot;Moxon&quot;, Histeria Kolectiva reminiscing of Leusemia, dios hastío euro-crustcore intense and desperate, Ataque Frontal classic I-spit-on-your-face band, one of the shapers of the scene, Psicosis ska/punk orchestra, 3 Al Hilo, punk rock and roll, Metadona female-fronted pop-punk, Magras punk/hardcore and reggae, P. T. K. this means Pateando Tu Kara, Sudor de Huevos (SDH)-punk, Los Rezios, Autonomia, Migraña, Irreverentes, Hazloquechuchapunkron, Perú No Existe, Generacion Perdida. It also mentioned fanzines: Caleta, Sub, Cuero Negro and Crash Boom Zap.

=== 2000s ===
A mature and prolific rock scene soon gained exposure due to the improved economic presence of Peru in the region. Peruvian TV and the Latin American division of MTV took notice of Peruvian bands, and included them in their shows ahead of the Peruvian mainstream radio. Peruvian rock videos were in normal rotation alongside regionally known acts like Soda Stereo, Shakira and Jaguares.

Líbido became Peru&#x27;s most successful band, selling hundreds of thousands of discs worldwide and receiving Grammy nominations and several Latin MTV awards. Soon other bands like Amen, Zen and TK found success. Aliados and Inyectores (both made up of ex-G3 members), Los Fuckin Sombreros, Campo De Almas, Pelo Madueño (drummer of the 1980s Peruvian rock band Narcosis and leader, vocalist and guitarist of the 1990s Peruvian rock band La Liga Del Sueño), 6 Voltios, Space bee, Zaraúz, Brinvonda, Turbopotamos, Vaselina, Leusemia, Pancho Pepe Jazz Band, Los Claxon, DaleVuelta, Tráfico, Uchpa which is a rock &amp; blues band in Quechua, Jose Arbulú (the vocalist and lead guitar of Cementerio Club), and Area 7 (an exponent of Peruvian Nu-Metal and the country&#x27;s only all-female metal band), were acts that developed at the local level. Peruvian electronic music has its representatives in bands like Theremyn 4, Unidad central, Deimos, Insumision, Ensamble, Vacuna tu hijo, Kollantes.

Dozens of new bands kept coming out and most of the 1990s bands were still playing and improving their recordings. The albums of the early rock banks, including Los Saicos, Traffic Sound, and We All Together were released on CDs. Radio stations became more receptive of mainstream Peruvian Rock, given its recent commercial success. Most of the Peruvian media continues to not promote popular underground acts such as punk and reggae.

===2010s===

During the 2010s, many groups have emerged in the larger cities of Peru, especially in Lima. The growing world scene of psychedelic rock had led to the psychedelic sound being mixed with other genres, influencing Peruvian bands Cholo Visceral (blending with prog rock), Los Silver Mornings (vintage rock), Spatial Moods (blues), Onerom (jazz), and The Dead End-Alley Band and El Jefazo (stoner rock). In some Internet articles it is called &quot;Nueva Psicodelia Latinoamericana&quot; as a way to differentiate it from other kinds of psychedelic rock music that have emerged in Latinamerica during the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s.https://noisey.vice.com/es_co/article/el-despertar-de-la-nueva-psicodelia-en-latinoamerica-parte-2

<doc id="1233404" wikidata="Q121665" url="?curid=1233404" title="Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau">
<text>Alex von Falkenhausen Motorenbau (AFM) (but some sources claim the M stood for Munich) was a German racing car constructor. The team was started by Alexander von Falkenhausen, who was in the 1930s an important engineer in the development of BMW&#x27;s model 328, along with Alfred Boning, Ernst Loof and Fritz Fiedler. The 328 was a dominant sports car in late 1930s Europe and winner of the 1940 Mille Miglia race in Brescia, Italy.


After World War II, von Falkenhausen opened a garage in Munich where he tuned pre-war 328s, converting some of them into single-seaters, and in 1948 went on to build his own car marque with the 328&#x27;s engine. As a result, the Formula 2 AFM-1 appeared in 1949, driven by Hans Stuck, resulting in a third place at the Grenzlandring. AFM won a heat in the Autodromo GP at Monza with Stuck behind the wheel, beating the Ferraris of Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio. Other cars were raced by Fritz Riess, Karl Gommann, Willi Heeks and Manfred von Brauchitsch. By 1951 Stuck was within the development of a lightweight V8 engine designed by Richard Küchen and won the 1951 Grenzlandring F2 race with the so-called AFM-4-&quot;Küchen&quot;. The and World Drivers&#x27; Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, enabling AFM cars to compete in several World Championship rounds. By the time 1953 rolled in, the cars were becoming less competitive and with the fall of F2 that year the marque and the team faded away, while Freiherr von Falkenhausen in 1954 started to work for BMW again, leading their &quot;Rennsportabteilung&quot; for more than the following 20 years.

==World Championship participation: 1952–1953==

The first AFM to be entered in a World Championship Grand Prix was a works car entered for Stuck at the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix. Stuck qualified the car 14th, beating some established names such as Harry Schell, who was driving a Maserati entered by Enrico Platé. However, he was some 14 seconds behind the pole time of Giuseppe Farina&#x27;s works Ferrari. In the race, Stuck dropped back steadily until Küchen&#x27;s engine failed him on the fifth lap.

The other race of 1952 to feature AFM cars was the German Grand Prix. Privately owned cars were entered by Willi Heeks, Helmut Niedermayr, Ludwig Fischer and Willi Krakau, all using BMW engines instead of the Küchen unit favoured by the works team. Neither Fischer nor Krakau started the race, and while Niedermayr was down in 22nd place, Heeks qualified his car a magnificent 9th. He qualified ahead of several works cars, including Jean Behra&#x27;s Gordini. Come the race, Heeks took advantage of both Paul Pietsch&#x27;s Veritas and Ernst Klodwig&#x27;s BMW running into trouble on the opening lap, and moved up to 7th, where he remained for 5 laps. However, on lap 6, he began to suffer with the BMW engine in his car, and by the end of the 8th lap, he was out. Meanwhile, Niedermayr had been making fantastic progress from his lowly grid slot. Heeks&#x27; retirement moved his compatriot up into 9th place. By capitalising on other&#x27;s mistakes. Niedermayr had moved up through the field, and when Robert Manzon&#x27;s Gordini lost a wheel on the 9th lap, he inherited the Frenchman&#x27;s 8th place. He was passed by Toni Ulmen, driving a Veritas, late in the race, but still brought the car home in 9th, the first ever finish for an AFM in a championship race.

AFMs were back in action in Germany the following year. Stuck entered once again, privately this time. He was using yet another different engine, the Bristol straight six. He was joined by Günther Bechem in his privately entered machine, and Theo Fitzau, driving a car for Niedermayr, who had performed so well in it himself the previous year. Niedermayr himself had retired from racing after killing at least 13 spectators during a crash at the Grenzlandring in 1952. Both Bechem and Fitzau were using BMW engines. Fitzau was the highest qualifier, in 21st place, over 80 seconds behind Alberto Ascari on pole for Ferrari. Stuck was 23rd, while Bechem, down in 30th, was well over 2 minutes shy of Ascari&#x27;s time, made possible by the extreme length of the Nürburgring circuit. Stuck was out on lap 1, as his new engine failed. By the end of lap 4, Bechem and Fitzau were also out with similar engine problems.

AFM&#x27;s last appearance in championship F1 came at the Italian Grand Prix later in the year, as Stuck entered his car again. He qualified second last, beating only Johnny Claes&#x27;s Connaught. However, he finished 14th in the race, simply by virtue of not running into difficulties. He was 13 laps behind the victorious Juan Manuel Fangio.

As Grand Prix racing abandoned the F2 regulations at the end of 1953, so AFM withdrew from the scene. Their best result remained Niedermayr&#x27;s 9th place at the German Grand Prix of 1952.

<doc id="1233412" wikidata="Q2321007" url="?curid=1233412" title="Adventures of Lolo 3">
<text>Adventures of Lolo 3 is a puzzle video game developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is based on the Japanese &quot;Eggerland&quot; video game series. It is the ninth installment of the Japanese &quot;Eggerland&quot; video game series; it was the fifth game released in European countries and the third one released in the United States and Canada. This American game re-used new gameplay elements, cut-scenes, and graphics from the Japanese-only &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot; (unrelated to the American &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot;).

The Japan-exclusive Adventures of Lolo 2, on the other hand, is a different game. It has a different difficulty curve and featured completely different stages. It was released for the Famicom and it is the eighth installment in the &quot;Eggerland&quot; series. New gameplay elements, later re-used in the American &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot;, were added to make the base gameplay deeper than before.

==Synopsis==
Lolo and Lala are enjoying some time together when the Great King of Eggerland&#x27;s son and heir throws a potion on all of Lolo and Lala&#x27;s friends, turning them to stone. Lolo and Lala return home to see the damage that the Great King&#x27;s son and heir has done and embark on a quest to stop him and return their friends to normal.

==Game information==
The player has the ability to select between playing as Lolo or Lala in the levels by pressing the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; button when on the overworld map. Neither character has any advantage over the other, however, the only difference being the character dialogue in the tutorial levels.

Two changes to the gameplay included the crumbling bridge, which is a bridge that can only be crossed two times before it crumbles into nothingness. The other change was a new monster called Moby. Mobies only appear in the underwater levels and use a line of sight attack that sucks Lolo in towards them. Though not directly a fatal attack, it can cause Lolo to get stuck and have to restart the room.

When pressing Select to give up, Lolo does not actually die this time. Instead, a short &quot;give up&quot; tune plays and the level restarts. Pressing Start will return the player to the overworld map. Pressing Start again reveals the password to that point in the game. &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot; uses 16-character passwords instead of four-character ones.

Unlike the previous game, there is no limit on lives. The player may restart the level as many times as desired without returning to the title screen.

The game features a total of 17 levels with 100 different puzzle rooms, nine boss rooms, and ten training rooms. Levels 3, 13, and 17 have ten rooms each. The other levels only have five rooms. Levels 4–7, 9–12, and 17 have a boss at the end. The two big trees on the overworld map are where the training rooms are, each tree having five rooms each.

==Reception==
Reception to &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot; is universally positive. Dylan Cornelius of Questicle wrote that &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot; is &quot;worth every penny&quot;. Lee Evans of Downwards Compatible wrote: &quot;If you like puzzlers, the Lolo series is a ton of fun, and &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot; is a standout&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A, and later picked the game as the #10 greatest game available in 1991.

<doc id="1233419" wikidata="Q124035" url="?curid=1233419" title="Ota Šik">
<text>Ota Šik ( ; 11 September 1919 – 22 August 2004) was a Czech economist and politician. He was the man behind the &quot;New Economic Model&quot; (economic liberalization plan) and he was also one of the key figures in the Prague Spring.

==Early years==
Šik was born in the industrial town of Plzeň, Czechoslovakia in to the family of a Jewish merchant as Ota Schick. Before the Second World War Šik studied Art at Charles University of Prague, and studied politics after the war.

Following the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and the partition of the whole nation in March 1939, Šik joined the Czech Resistance movement. However, he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 and sent to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. At Mauthausen Šik&#x27;s fellow inmates included Antonín Novotný, the future president of Czechoslovakia (who was succeeded by the leader of the Prague Spring Alexander Dubček), and Dubček&#x27;s father, Štefan.

==Political career==
The connections that Šik made at Mauthausen proved useful in his post-war political career. In the early 1960s he attempted to persuade the hardline president, Novotný, into loosening his rigid adherence to central planning, which had been crippling the economy. Šik, who by this point was an economics professor and member of the Communist party, wanted to bring market elements into central planning, to relax price controls and to promote private enterprise in the hope of kickstarting the stagnant economic climate. It was around this point that Šik was elected to the party&#x27;s central committee and was made head of the economics institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences. 

Šik&#x27;s reforms were launched in 1967, before Dubček came to power, but were heavily watered down by party &quot;apparatchiks&quot; who worried about losing control of the factories. The only palpable, and certainly the most popular, result of the reforms was the appearance of private taxis on the streets of Prague. In December 1967, at a party meeting that was a precursor to Dubček&#x27;s rise to power a month later, Šik publicly denounced Novotný&#x27;s regime. He demanded a fundamental change to the Communist system and a new leadership, two decades before Mikhail Gorbachev he announced that economic reform could not be separated from fundamental political change. By this point Czechoslovakia had the lowest growth rates in the Soviet bloc, whereas previously it had been the economic backbone of the Habsburg empire.

Following Dubček&#x27;s election as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Šik was made a deputy prime minister in April 1968 and he was the architect of the economics section of Dubček&#x27;s action programme. Šik claimed that if his policies were followed then Czechoslovakia would be on an economic par with neighbouring Austria within four years. However these plans were never followed out after the Prague Spring was brutally ended in August of the same year by the tanks of the Soviet army.

==After the Prague Spring==
When the tanks rolled into Prague, Šik was on holiday in Yugoslavia. With the threat of arrest looming, he did not return to his homeland. Leonid Brezhnev and the Soviet Communist Party&#x27;s propaganda machine singled Šik out for particular attention. In August 1968, TASS issued a press release calling him an agent of U.S. imperialism and &quot;one of the most odious figures of the rightwing revisionists&quot;. 

Šik left Yugoslavia in October 1968 and moved to Switzerland. In 1969, he returned to Prague and tried to convince his colleagues but his views were rejected. Thus, he returned to Switzerland, where he became an economics professor at the University of St. Gallen in 1970, holding the post until his retirement in 1990. After the Velvet Revolution, Šik became an economic advisor to the Czech president, but had no impact on actual economic policies. He became a Swiss citizen and lived there until his death.

==Major works==
Šik was known as a market socialist but through the time he became a proponent of social market economy instead of market socialism. His major works include: 
*&quot;The Third Way: Marxist-Leninist Theory &amp; Modern Industrial Society&quot; (1972)
*&quot;For a Humane Economic Democracy&quot; (1979)
*&quot;The Communist Power System&quot; (1981)
*&quot;Economic Systems&quot; (1989)

<text>Mustard Plug is an American ska punk band from Grand Rapids, Michigan, consisting of Dave Kirchgessner (vocals), Brandon Jenison (trumpet), Jim Hofer (trombone), Nate Cohn (drums), Colin Clive (guitar/vocals), Mark Petz (tenor saxophone) and Greg Witulski (bass).

Formed in 1991, the band has regularly toured throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and South America. They have toured with the Warped Tour twice, and participated in the Ska Against Racism Tour. , the band has released eight studio albums and continues to tour actively.

Explaining the band&#x27;s goal, Jim Hofer said, &quot;We may have some messages in our music, but essentially we just do this because we love it and we want people to lighten up and have fun.&quot;

==History==

The band formed in 1991 after Colin and Dave both attended a Special Beat show. The band&#x27;s original members were Dave Kirchgessner, Mike McKendrick, Colin Clive, and Anthony Vilchez. There was virtually no ska scene in Grand Rapids at the time, so Mustard Plug was able to develop a unique sound and draw a large following.

Brandon Jenison stated in an interview that their band name originated when &quot;a guy in the early stages of the band was making a sandwich and that crusty stuff that forms on the mustard bottle when you put it in the fridge without wiping it off first gave him an interesting idea for a name.&quot;

In 2002, the band released &quot;Yellow #5&quot;, and supported the album for years on tour. In 2005, they released the &quot;greatest hits&quot; album &quot;&quot;.

Mustard Plug was on the label Hopeless Records for many years, but had a period of free agency until their signing with Bad Time Records.

The band celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2011 with a national tour.

In 2012, the band had an idea for a live album called &quot;Mustard Plug:Live!&quot;, but canceled in favor of their 2014 album &quot;Can&#x27;t Contain It&quot;, the recording of which was funded via Kickstarter. The album features cover art by Jeff Rosenstock of Bomb the Music Industry.

In May 2017, the band performed at Pouzza Fest in Montreal. In 2019, they embarked on a tour of Japan. The band continues to perform around the United States on a regular basis. In 2021, long-time bassist Rick Johnson left the group.

On September 8, 2023, the band released &quot;Where Did All My Friends Go?&quot;, their first studio album in 9 years, on DIY label Bad Time Records.

<text>Russian rock music originated in the Soviet Union in the 1960s based on the influence of Western rock music and bard songs, and was developed by both amateur bands and official VIA.

The &quot;golden age&quot; of Russian rock was during the 1980s (especially the era of perestroika), when the Soviet underground rock bands became able to release their records officially. During this period, &quot;rock clubs&quot; were created, bands like &quot;Kino&quot;, &quot;Alisa&quot;, &quot;DDT&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Nautilus Pompilius&quot;, &quot;Aria&quot;, &quot;Chaif&quot;, and &quot;Grazhdanskaya Oborona&quot; appeared and gained popularity, and already known groups, such as &quot;Mashina Vremeni&quot; and &quot;Aquarium&quot;, began to publish albums officially.

Russian rock&#x27;s characteristic feature was the emphasis on the lyrics. Due to its lyrical emphasis, it became a symbol of the youth of the Perestroika era. Russian rock of the 20th century is often considered a united cultural movement that has some common musical, aesthetic and ideological features.
In the 21st century, almost all genres of rock music exist in Russia, which is why &quot;Russian rock&quot; has become a more vague concept. The majority of the Russian bands perform in the Russian language.

According to various polls, the most popular Russian rock bands include Kino, Aquarium, Aria, Alisa, DDT and Agatha Christie.

==History==

===The early 1960s: Local bard music and first western influences===
By the mid-1960s, beat groups had formed in Moscow and Leningrad, at first performing cover versions of foreign hits on home-made equipment. Among these groups were &quot;Sokol&quot;, &quot;Scythians&quot;, &quot;Buffoons&quot; and &quot;Slavs&quot; (Alexander Gradsky&#x27;s groups), and &quot;Forest Brothers&quot;. In 1965, the band Sokol released the first rock song in Russian, &quot;Gde tot krai?&quot; (). The beat quartet &quot;Integral&quot; performed jazz music and compositions in the style of The Shadows and The Swinging Blue Jeans, and also composed their own twists and rock &#x27;n&#x27; rolls. With the spread of Beatlemania, almost every school had its own rock band. The movement was partly influenced by the ideology of the Western hippies.

At the same time, Russian rock was partly influenced by bard music, a style referred to as &quot;avtorskaya pesnya&quot; (), mostly played on unaccompanied acoustic guitar. It was characterized by a strong emphasis on lyrics that sometimes carried a subversive meaning, as well as a lively and informal approach to the theme - romance, everyday life, military songs, patriotic songs, satire, irony etc. The most famous performers of the bard song were Alexander Galich, Vladimir Vysotsky, Bulat Okudzhava.

Meanwhile, Western music was either being smuggled across the border or released by Melodiya as part of what was essentially state-run media piracy, with The Beatles taking a firm place in Soviet popular culture, and artists such as The Rolling Stones and Deep Purple completing a somewhat distorted picture of Western music.

===The late 1960s and 1970s: Formation of the movement===

In the late 1960s, the most advanced Russian rockers began experimenting with folk sound.

The beat music movement developed in the provinces. The first Russian rock and roll magazine &quot;Beat-Echo&quot; was released in 1965 (as samizdat). On December 18, 1966, the first rock festival in the USSR was held in Kamensk-Uralsky, Sverdlovsk region. In May 1969, the festival later known as &quot;Woodstock-na-Donu&quot; was held in Rostov-na-Donu.

However, the musicians of independent bands faced two problems that limited their activities. The first was the unavailability of recording studios (then sole record label, Melodiya, would later forge a partnership with international label EMI in the 70s). The second problem was that after completing higher education, musicians had to make a choice: to leave to work in their specialty or join a professional band - VIA ().

Guitar-driven bands evolved during this time, including Leningrad-based Pojuschie Gitary and Belarusian Pesnyary. These bands started the VIA movement, and were followed by others, such as Tsvety, Ariel, , and Sinyaya Ptitsa. Some Soviet composers — David Tukhmanov, Yury Antonov — tried to combine the traditions of Soviet estrada with modern musical ideas, including those introduced by Western rock music. At the same time, Mashina Vremeni in Moscow and Aquarium in Leningrad started as nominally amateur bands and soon became popular, performing underground concerts.

In the early 1970s, Yuri Morozov invented a kind of Russian psychedelic rock, using elements of progressive rock and ethnic Russian music. His sound influenced DDT, Aquarium, Chizh &amp; Co, and many others, while he worked with them as a sound engineer. Morozov, as well as &quot;Scythians&quot;, &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Tin Soldiers&quot;, released the earliest Russian rock recordings through samizdat.

Another notable artist who started his activity at the same time is Alexander Gradsky, who fused bard music with Western rock. As successful composer and singer, he was able to release some of his recordings through Melodiya since 1973.

In 1970 and 1971, the first All-Soviet rock festival &quot;Silver Strings&quot; was held. In 1971 and 1972, the &quot;Pop Federation&quot; organization was engaged in underground rock concerts. Moscow Power Engineering Institute was the most famous venue for rock bands of the 1970s in Moscow. In March 1976, Tallinn (ESSR) hosted the &quot;Tallinn Youth Songs&quot; Rock Festival, which brought together bands from different republics of the Soviet Union. During this period, concert recordings, rather than studio recordings, were mainly distributed, which were rewritten as self-published from one owner of the tape recorder to another. Since 1979, new underground recording studios have emerged (AnTrop, Sverdlovsk Studio etc.).

For Leningrad, the concept of acoustic kvartirnik (house concert) was spread; Moscow bands performed mainly in electricity. &quot;Ruby Attack&quot;, &quot;Argonauts&quot;, &quot;Mify&quot;, &quot;Successful Acquisition&quot;, &quot;Mashina Vremeni&quot;, &quot;Sankt-Peterburg&quot;, &quot;Rossiyane&quot;, &quot;Vysokosnoe leto&quot;, &quot;Autograph&quot;, and &quot;Voskreseniye&quot; were among the main groups of the 1970s underground scene. Most of them were influenced by the styles of art rock, hard rock and progressive rock.

Some of the first officially published full-length rock albums were &quot;Russian pictures&quot; VIA &quot;Ariel&quot; (1977) and &quot;Guslar&quot; VIA &quot;Pesnyary&quot; (1979). Some Soviet composers of the turn of the 70s - 80s worked in the rock opera format; the most famous works are &quot;Orpheus and Eurydice&quot; (1975), &quot;The Star and the Death of Joaquin Murieta&quot; (1978), and &quot;Juno and Avos&quot; (1981).

===The 1980s: Golden era===

In the 1980s, an underground scene of rock artists emerged who based their style on a mix of Western rock music (particularly from the 1960s and 1970s, but also, increasingly, on the emerging New Wave, NWOBHM and Western punk rock) and the Russian bard traditions. Bands such as Voskreseniye, Alisa, Autograph, Kino, Mashina Vremeni, Nautilus Pompilius, Aquarium, Secret, Piknik, DDT, Krematorij, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and Agatha Christie became influential in the development of the genre, with subsequent artists influenced by their style. At the same time, many bands of the 1980s were, in a sense, a group accompanying a songwriter. Often bands were formed around such an author of lyrics (and sometimes music), who was usually considered a &quot;leader&quot; and, just like the band, became widely known.

In 1980, Spring Rhythms: Tbilisi-80 took place in Tbilisi in the Georgian SSR. It was the first official rock festival in the Soviet Union. Many of the prize-winners at the festival were rock groups from the Russian SFSR, as well as Georgia and the Baltics. The &quot;Fiztech—1982&quot; festival actually launched the popularity of new wave.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a lot of amateur bands who signed labor agreements and contracts with various philharmonic societies of the USSR, such as &quot;Mashina Vremeni&quot;, &quot;Zemlyane&quot;, &quot;Autograph&quot;, &quot;Cruise&quot;, and &quot;Dialog&quot;, among others, were able to break into professional scene.

Since the mid-80s Russian rock was also influenced by the Russian art group Mitki.
The lyrics of the Soviet rock bands often dealt with the darkest sides of 1980s Soviet life, such as domestic violence, alcoholism (an infamous song by Nautilus Pompilius contained the lines &quot;Alain Delon drinks a double bourbon/Alain Delon doesn&#x27;t drink eau de cologne&quot; as a sarcastic contrast to the alcoholic father described in the song and an indictment of the escapist attitudes of state-run media) and crime, and often carried a hidden political message.

In consequence, the mainstream Soviet radio and television ignored Soviet rock bands, which often reached audiences only through word of mouth. The monopoly for music publishing in the USSR belonged to Melodiya, the Soviet record label owned and operated by the Council of Ministers through the Ministry of Culture. Melodiya had a strict policy against publishing rock music or underground musicians, while promoting VIAs, whose members (as well as the composers and writers who worked with them) were members of the Union of Composers. Some rock musicians (Yuri Shevchuk, Yegor Letov and many others) had problems with the KGB due to their public activities. During the early 1980s, Soviet authorities started to exert heavy pressure on amateur bands, banning underground concerts as a sort of illegal commercial activity and imprisoning some music promoters and sound engineers for earning money from underground concerts.

Many of the bands from the 1980s remain active and popular among Russian youth. The term &quot;Russian rock&quot; is often used to refer to the particular sound of these bands.

====Various music scenes====

In the early- to mid-1980s, rock clubs were founded in Moscow, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). These three cities had their own rock scenes and friendly collaborations between artists were commonplace.

The Leningrad Rock Club, founded in 1981 and supported by the CPSU, Komsomol, and the city and federal governments, was probably the biggest venue, featuring &quot;classic Russian rock&quot; by Aquarium, Kino, Zoopark, Piknik, Alisa, DDT, Televizor, N.E.P., etc. It also included the nascent Russian art-rock movement, typified by bands such as Auktyon. An important figure in the Leningrad Rock scene was Sergey Kuryokhin, a well-known piano/keyboard player of different music genres including rock and free-jazz, and leader of his ambitious multimedia project Pop Mekhanika, was one of the first Soviet underground musicians to release albums in Europe and the United States.

Bands from Sverdlovsk, such as Nautilus Pompilius, Chaif, and Agatha Christie, produced more melodic music, making heavy use of keyboards and synthesizers.

Moscow rock bands, such as Aria, Mashina Vremeni, Voskreseniye, Center, Krematorij and Zvuki Mu, were rather different from the others, and sometimes more discreet.

The Siberian rock scene began in the 1980s, with songwriters such as Egor Letov (Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Omsk), Kalinov most, Alexander Bashlachev and Yanka Dyagileva. Their music varied from simple lo-fi punk to indie rock (sometimes acoustic), and the core of their songs were the lyrics. Many albums were first self-released and distributed among fans via trading, then officially re-released years later. Lyrics were often obscene, and showed that the writers had major problems with the Soviet administration and KGB. A notable act that was not a member of any of the three Rock-Clubs, but nonetheless highly popular, is rock and roll band Secret.

At that time, the Russian heavy-metal scene originated thanks to bands like Aria, Chorny Kofe and Master (formed by a few ex-members of Aria).

The glam-metal band Gorky Park achieved high popularity in the west, and was even aired on MTV.

Russian punk&#x27;s unique style is generally accepted to be most idealized by Grazhdanskaya Oborona and by Egor Letov&#x27;s other projects. The music mixes equal parts Western punk and traditional Russian influences, with gritty production and extremely charged and political lyrics.

=====Punk music movement=====
The Soviet Union punk-rock culture started in the 1980s, mostly as a protest movement against the corruption of the regime and the sense there was &quot;no future&quot;. It differed from British punk culture in that the Soviet Union did not have an explicit class society, and the society as such was communist; as a result, Soviet punk became a protest against the social climate of the time. Soviet punks usually wore boots and coats found in military shops. While in the UK punk arose partly as a protest against more-established rock-music genres like progressive rock or glam rock, in the Soviet Union all rock music remained in the underground, which made for a certain solidarity between punk-rock fans and other rock fans in Russia.

Aside from the traditional anarchist ideology, many Russian punks belong to the National Bolshevik movement (with its founder Eduard Limonov, being a punk himself in his youth) and Yegor Letov, the godfather of Russian punk, linking it to the movement.

Yegor Letov is considered the godfather of Russian punk with his band Grazhdanskaya Oborona, which started performing in the early 1980s. During Soviet times, the band frequently got in trouble with the authorities, and each of the members wasarrested for their activities at some point.
In the late 1980s another band started operating in Russia, reaching a cult status: Sektor Gaza. They proclaimed themselves as &quot;kolkhoz punk rockers&quot;, mixing elements from Russian village life with punk music. However, while some called the band &quot;original&quot; and &quot;true folk punk&quot;, others criticized the band&#x27;s style. Mikhail Gorsheniov from Korol i Shut said: &quot;Sektor Gaza were never a part of the punk rock wave! They have no idea in music at all&quot;.

Another cult band formed a few years later was Korol i Shut, introducing horror punk, using costumes and lyrics in the form of tales and fables. Through sophisticated texts and themes not usually explored by punk, and through a sophisticated punk sound, Korol i Shut achieved the status of one of the most popular bands in Russia.

=====Tatars=====

Traditionally, Tatar rock music has been a Tatar language version of rock music in Russia. Therefore, the lyrics and vocals take priority over instrumental sounds. Some of the earliest Tatar rock bands were Soviet bands Saq-Soq and Bolgar, as well as Başqarma from Finland, all bands active in the late 1980s. Today, the most popular Tatar rock bands are Alqanat (since 2005) from Aqtanış and Xat (since 2001) from Sarman. Some other popular bands are KGB, Yar band, İlsöyä Bädretdineva, İsmail, rhymes and 116.

Other pop-rock groups include Malaylar, Yarda and Ataqlı Radio Şäxeslär. Pop singer Alsou has sung, at times, in her native Tatar.

====From underground to publicity====
The late 1980s was a period of breakthrough for soviet rock music entering the public eye. Political and social changes in the country were very important for this process.

The censorship was still present, but not as rigid as it was in the 1970s or early 1980s. It took years for the first Soviet rock bands to enter radio and television programs, tour in major concert halls over the USSR, and to release their albums officially on Melodiya, in direct competition with the VIA groups.

The rock music situation changed during the perestroika era. Many Russian rock bands were able to tour and record in Europe and United States for the first time. As a result, in 1989-1991 the situation was completely different from that of 1985. Moscow Music Peace Festival was held in Moscow featuring western rock artists, Gorbachev accepted Scorpions in Kremlin, Brian Eno produced an album by Zvuki Mu, and Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame) produced &quot;Radio Silence&quot; by Boris Grebenshchikov for the release in the western world.

With Joanna Stingray&#x27;s initiative, in 1986 the &quot;Red Wave&quot; compilation was released in the United States. It was a double split album with four bands from Leningrad: Aquarium, Kino, Alisa, and Strannye Igry, with one side of vinyl for each band. This compilation was the first official Russian rock release in the west. Stingray sent copies of the release to Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev, with a statement saying that musicians had already done what both presidents could not do diplomatically. Melodiya&#x27;s reaction was an official release of a record by Aquarium in order to create the illusion that recordings of the band were also widely released in the USSR.

Television and film also contributed to the breakthrough of Russian rock to the public in the 1980s. New musical television shows, such as &quot;Muzykalny Ring&quot; (Музыкальный ринг) and &quot;Programma A&quot; (Программа &quot;А&quot;), invited rock artists for interviews and live shows. In the late 1980s, several films featuring Russian rock musicians as actors were released. These films include &quot;Igla&quot; and &quot;Assa&quot; featuring Viktor Tsoi and music by Aquarium and &quot;Taxi Blues&quot; featuring Pyotr Mamonov. The Canadian filmmaker Peter Vronsky travelled to Moscow and Leningrad in February 1988, and shot a series of music videos with , Aquarium, Nebo i Zemlya, Zvuki Mu and other bands. The music videos were tied together in the documentary film &quot;Russian Rock Underground,&quot; which aired on MuchMusic television in Canada and on Italian television.

Estimates of the popularity explosion of Russian rock in that period are ambiguous. In a series of articles devoted to the history of the Soviet Union, &quot;Argumenty I Fakty&quot; noted: &quot;Young people plunged headlong into rock, which came out of the underground, which, as recognized by the best musicians of this direction, didn&#x27;t have a creative agenda at that moment.&quot;

===The 1990s: Post-Soviet era===
The beginning of the 1990s are considered to be the end of the &quot;classic&quot; Russian rock era. The two events that mark its end are the death of Viktor Tsoi in 1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Nevertheless, the Russian rock sound continued to live, and the new Russian rock sound of the &#x27;90s was based on it. Many Soviet rock bands, such as DDT, Nautilus Pompilius, Mashina Vremeni, were still popular. In 1996 the recording company Moroz started releasing the highly popular series Legends of Russian Rock.
In the mid-late 1990s the radio station Nashe Radio was created to promote Russian rock artists, broadcasting in all major Russian cities. Nashe Radio notably influenced the public&#x27;s auditory taste, and helped many artists gain popularity. The radio station founded Nashestvie, the largest open-air rock festival of Russian rock music, performed annually from 1999-2019, and was always headlined with famous rock acts.

Often aired by Nashe Radio, bands like Splean, Nochniye Snaiperi, Smisloviye Galutzinatzii, Chicherina, and Bi-2 created a refreshed Russian rock sound which adopted many elements from Alternative rock. Dolphin created a mixture between alternative rock, electronic music and rapcore.

An eminent representative of the heavy metal music genre was Aria, which had achieved great recognition and popularity among a wide audience in the 1990s.

In the late 1990s, numerous punk, pop-punk and grunge bands broke through. Sektor Gaza was first Russian band to use curse words and vulgar short stories in its lyrics. The horror punk band Korol i Shut managed to achieve a cult status and mainstream success using fairy-tale inspired lyrics. Other notable punk artists included Pilot, Lumen, Tarakany!, and Nogu Svelo!. Many of them developed an original sound and included involvement of unconventional instruments like violin.

Ska punk was brought to popularity mainly by the band Leningrad, notable for the extensive use of mat (Russian profanity) in its lyrics.

The Russian instrumental rock artist Victor Zinchuk reached international success with his solo career, and with that brought the Russian instrumental rock scene to a bigger audience.

Indie rock was represented by bands such as Masha i medvedi.

The western Pop rock sound was introduced by Ilya Lagoutenko&#x27;s Mumiy Troll, who made their records in the UK under the guidance of UK producers. This less lyrically loaded and more energetic style, frequently referred to as rockapops, which was also used by other notable musicians such as Zemfira, and became prevalent among the younger public.

The Russian crime films &quot;Brother&quot;, with its soundtrack featuring the band Nautilus Pompilius, and its sequel &quot;Brother 2&quot;, which featured music from various Russian rock artists, brought many young fans to Russian rock.

===The 2000s: Further development===
The 2000s in Russian rock were marked by both a continuance of the 1990s and something of a comeback of the classic 1980s sound. In the years following the renaissance of Russian cinema and rock, rock in Russia seemed to gain enough ground to differentiate widely through various genres. The 2005 Live 8 concert in Moscow featured mainly Russian rock artists.

Alternative metal, Nu metal and metalcore gained wider popularity at that time. In the mid-2000s, bands like Amatory, Tracktor Bowling, Grenouer, Slot, and 5 Diez were established, and were intensively promoted by the Russian television channel A-One. The channel awarded many of them with the .

The Russian heavy metal scene continued to develop, with power metal bands like Catharsis and Epidemia, founded in the 1990s, receiving more attention, and progressive metal band Orgia Pravednikov rising to prominence. In 2002, Valery Kipelov left Aria and formed the band Kipelov with other ex-members of Aria.

Folk rock music had a revival following Pelageya&#x27;s and Melnitsa&#x27;s rise from underground acts to bands that were played on the radio, and the attention pagan metal bands like Arkona received.

Though the Russian progressive rock scene had existed since the 1970s, it entered the public eye of Russian rock fans in the 2000s, with bands like Little Tragedies and The Gourishankar being its most obvious representatives. Since 2001, a prog-music festival named InProg was held almost yearly in Moscow. Its popularity constantly grew, and in 2005 it turned from a local festival into an international one. The Russian instrumental rock scene, with bands like EXIT project, Disen Gage, Dvar and Kostarev Group, also received more recognition at that time.

===The 2010s: Decline===
Despite the fact many bands from previous decades are still active, such as DDT and Splean, due to the lack of new bands gaining significant attention, there is a common view that Russian rock is in decline. Ilya Chert, from the band Pilot, said: &quot;I can see the decline of Russian rock. We are going back to the times, when those who are really talented and wise are operating in basements and clubs with the capacity of 50 people, as they don&#x27;t commercialize themselves and no one commercializes them&quot;. Artemy Troitsky, the famous Russian rock critic, wrote an article titled &quot;Rock died a long time ago, but the funeral was impressive&quot;, where he brought up the lack of new faces in the Russian rock scene, and accused bands like Mashina Vremeni and Garik Sukachev for &quot;selling out&quot; and not protesting against the current government. In 2008 MTV Russia cancelled the nomination &quot;Best Rock Project&quot;, with the resulting headlines being &quot;MTV Recognized the Death of Russian Rock&quot;.
From 2009 to 2013, Samara hosted a one-day international rock festival in Europe — Rock on the Volga.

====Rock musicians divided by the Crimean Crisis====
The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 divided the Russian rock community into supporters and opposers of the move. Former Aria leader, and current leader of the band Kipelov, Valery Kipelov, expressed support of the &quot;annexation&quot;, and stated that it should&#x27;ve been done in 1991. He performed at music festivals celebrating the event in Crimea.

Konstantin Kinchev and his band Alisa, considered to be among the pioneers of Russian rock, expressed support of the move, and cancelled all of his concerts in Ukraine. Kinchev had already expressed views supporting the return of Crimea to Russia in 2008.

Other prominent figures in Russian rock who expressed support of the move included Chaif, Chicherina, Alexander F. Sklyar, and Vadim Samoylov (ex-Agatha Christie member).

On the other hand, Andrey Makarevich was one of the organizers of the 2014 anti-war protests in Russia, and harshly criticized the annexation Another prominent figure to criticize the annexation was Yuri Shevchuk (DDT) Singer Zemfira expressed her opposition by waving a Ukrainian flag while performing on stage.

The musicians who didn&#x27;t criticize the annexation, spoke against war in general, and called for peace between the peoples, were prominent figures such as Boris Grebenshchikov (Aquarium) and Vyacheslav Butusov (Nautilus Pompilius).

==Characteristics==
Fans of Russian Rock would frequently refer to most of the music on MTV Russia dismissively as &quot;popsa&quot;, a dichotomy that appeared in the &#x27;80s, when government-controlled radio and TV stations would air only politically harmless music by performers such as Philipp Kirkorov. The lines are still quite clearly drawn, with bands such as Nogu Svelo! - who recorded a song with pop-singer Nataliya Vetlitskaya - being an anomaly.

In contrast to Western rock, Russian rock is often said to have less drive; it is characterized by different rhythms, instruments and more involved lyrics. Unconventional instruments have often been used in addition to the standard electric guitars and drums associated with rock music (very often violin and wind instruments).

Another characteristic of Russian Rock is being partly folk rock. Very often, Russian Rock songs, especially those of the classic 80s bands, talk about national themes, and feature elements from Russian folk music. Aquarium, DDT and Yuri Morozov are examples of this.

Considering its poetic roots (Russian literature, bard music), lyrics play a far larger role in Russian rock than Western rock. Vocal melody is sometimes eschewed in favor of a more impassioned delivery (Viktor Tsoi, the lead singer of Kino, pioneered a characteristically strained, monotonous style of singing that has been imitated by many).

The metaphor of Russia facing both East and West is epitomized by the double-headed Eagle on its coat-of-arms. The Eastern influence in the Russian rock is heard in soundtracks from movies like &quot;Day Watch,&quot; which has Tamerlane&#x27;s legend of the Chalk of Destiny at its roots. Russian rock expressively used and integrated elements from both Western and Eastern culture (especially from countries of the USSR).

Yngvar Bordrewich Steinholt (University of Tromsø, Norway) has written a PhD thesis in English, printed by The Mass Media Music Scholars Press, titled &quot;Rock in the Reservation&quot; (2004), about the Leningrad Rock Club. It also touched upon the history of rock in Russia and its counter-cultural tendencies.

==Wordplay==
In Russian, the original meaning of word &quot;&quot; is &quot;fate&quot; or &quot;doom&quot;. The word is used almost exclusively in fiction, especially poetry (a more widely used synonym is &quot;&quot;). These correlate with the poetic roots of Russian rock and its attention to &quot;serious&quot; topics.

The wordplay is used in the song &quot;This is Fate&quot; () from Aria&#x27;s debut album &quot;Mania Velichia&quot;.

<text>Sterling Memorial Library (SML) is the main library building of the Yale University Library system in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. Opened in 1931, the library was designed by James Gamble Rogers as the centerpiece of Yale&#x27;s Gothic Revival campus. The library&#x27;s tower has sixteen levels of bookstacks containing over 4 million volumes. Several special collections—including the university&#x27;s Manuscripts &amp; Archives—are also housed in the building. It connects via tunnel to the underground Bass Library, which holds an additional 150,000 volumes.

The library is named for John W. Sterling, a lawyer representing Standard Oil, whose huge bequest to Yale required that an &quot;enduring, useful and architecturally beautiful edifice&quot; be built. Sterling Library is elaborately ornamented, featuring extensive sculpture and painting as well as hundreds of panes of stained glass created by G. Owen Bonawit. In addition to the book tower, Rogers&#x27; design featured five large reading rooms and two courtyards, one of which is now a music library.

While the library&#x27;s nave and main reading rooms can be visited on guided tours, its collections are restricted to cardholders.

==History==

For the ninety years prior to the construction of Sterling Memorial Library, Yale&#x27;s library collections had been held in the College Library, a chapel-like Gothic Revival building on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus now known as Dwight Hall. Built to house a collection of 40,000 books in the 1840s, and later expanded to Linsly Hall and Chittenden Hall, the old library could not hold Yale&#x27;s swelling book collection, which had grown to over one million volumes.

In 1918, Yale received a $17-million bequest from John W. Sterling, founder of the New York law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling, providing that Yale construct &quot;at least one enduring, useful and architecturally beautiful edifice.&quot; The largest bequest in the history of any American university, it initiated a major period of construction on Yale&#x27;s campus. Because of the library collection&#x27;s growth, the university decided to make the centerpiece of Sterling&#x27;s gift a new library with a capacity for 3.5 million volumes.

The building&#x27;s original architect, Bertram Goodhue, intended the library to resemble his State Capitol Building in Lincoln, Nebraska, with the library&#x27;s books in a prominent tower. When Goodhue died in 1924, the project passed to James Gamble Rogers, the university&#x27;s consulting architect. Rogers&#x27; work on a &quot;General Plan&quot; for the Yale campus allowed him to incorporate the main library project into his neo-Gothic scheme for Yale&#x27;s expansion.

Roger&#x27;s campus plan called for the library to sit on a new main courtyard, now called Cross Campus. Originally, he planned to balance the courtyard with a 5,000-seat chapel facing opposite the library. With the end of compulsory undergraduate chapel services in 1926 and the lack of a financier, the chapel was never built. Expanding on Goodhue&#x27;s tower concept, Rogers proposed the library take the form of a cathedral, which, in his own words, would be &quot;as near to modern Gothic as we dared to make it.&quot; He modeled the library&#x27;s entrance hall to resemble a vaulted nave and commissioned extensive stained glass and stone ornament to decorate the building&#x27;s exterior and interior.

The library&#x27;s footprint would take up more than half a city block. Twenty buildings were cleared for its construction, many of them private homes. Although excavation began in the fall of 1927, the construction site was not fully secured until July 1928, when the final holdout homeowner agreed to sell.

While the new library was planned and constructed, Yale began soliciting gifts from its alumni for the new library. By 1931, the collection had grown to nearly 2 million volumes, many of them rare books and manuscripts. Among the most important of these acquisitions was a Gutenberg Bible donated by Anna Harkness. The bible became the centerpiece of the new library&#x27;s Rare Book Room, which allowed students and researchers to browse the most valuable books in the university&#x27;s collection for the first time, a function later subsumed in part by the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.

At the time of its construction, the choice of cathedral architecture attracted criticism. Like much of Yale&#x27;s revivalist construction of the same era, the new library was criticized as expensive and retrograde. William Harlan Hale, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, scorned it as a &quot;cathedral orgy,&quot; criticized the library&#x27;s bastardized cathedral aesthetics and the university&#x27;s timid anti-modernism. Many students of architecture leveled similar criticisms. Others asserted that the project was either sanctimonious or sacrilegious for merging academic purpose and religious architecture. Later critics have praised the building&#x27;s ambition, beauty, and pragmatism.

==Building==
The library is situated on Yale&#x27;s Cross Campus, the central quadrangle of the university. Surrounding buildings, including Berkeley College, Trumbull College, and Sterling Law Building were designed by Rogers and built in the same period and Gothic Revival style as the library.

===Nave===

The entrance hall of the library is known as the &quot;nave&quot; because it imitates the main approach of a cathedral. At its western terminus is a chancel containing an ornate circulation desk and altarpiece mural painted by Eugene Savage. Constructed of Indiana limestone and Ohio sandstone blocks, the nave is a self-supporting stone structure with none of the steel reinforcement used elsewhere in the library. It is elaborately decorated with stone and wood carving, ironwork, stained glass windows, and ceiling bosses. The main hall is flanked by two aisles, which originally held card catalogs for the library bookstacks. Though the original catalog drawers remain in the aisles, the cards have been removed and the aisles converted to seating areas and a computer lab. At its western end it is intersected by a transept, which leads to the library&#x27;s main reading room on one end and its wing on the other. For many years, smoking was allowed in the nave, which left a layer of soot on its upper levels. Beginning in 2013, the nave underwent a $20-million, yearlong renovation to clean its surfaces, restore its architectural details, overhaul building systems, and reconfigure visitor circulation and services.

===Tower===
Fifteen levels of library materials, primarily books, are housed in the building&#x27;s tower, commonly referred to as the &quot;Stacks&quot;. Originally intended to house 3.5 million volumes, it is a seven-story structure, with eight mezzanine levels interleaved between the main stories. Although encased in a Gothic exterior, the tower&#x27;s structural system is a welded steel frame, which permits a vertical rise that traditional Gothic techniques would not. The crenelated roof of the tower is elaborately decorated, complete with a castle-like housing for air handling equipment.

The tower&#x27;s shelves are estimated to stretch , contained within of aisles. In addition to the library collections, the tower houses reading rooms, study carrels, library offices, and special collections, including the Babylonian Collection. Access to the Stacks is restricted to affiliates of the university and library patrons.

===Reading rooms===

Four reading rooms sit near the nave on the first floor of the library:

* Starr Reading Room, the main reading room of the library, is at the south end of the library, next to Trumbull College. It is a reference room designed in the style of a monastic refectory. Under a barrel-vaulted ceiling, the room is lined with traceried windows and oak bookshelves decorated with a botanical frieze. A 1998 restoration was funded by The Starr Foundation.
* The Periodical Reading Room, lined with oak shelves like those of the main reading room, is reached through from a vestibule on the north side of the nave. The room can hold 1,800 periodicals and features windows decorated with signs of the zodiac to symbolize periodicity.
* Linonia and Brothers Reading Room, a Tudor-style browsing room at the building&#x27;s northeast corner. It is named for Yale&#x27;s two 18th-century literary societies, Linonia and Brothers in Unity, and holds about 20,000 books. Intended to be a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s club&quot; for leisure reading, it was not opened to women until the 1960s.
* Franke Family Reading Room, a periodical browsing room, is in the library&#x27;s southeast corner. Originally a room for frequently-used materials known as the Reserve Book Room, its collections were moved to Cross Campus Library in 1971.

The tower holds smaller reading rooms for the library&#x27;s area studies holdings, including African, East Asian, Latin American, Near East, Slavic and East European, Southeast Asian, and Judaica collections. There are also dedicated reading rooms for several fields of study, including American Studies, History, and Philosophy.

===Wing===

Sterling&#x27;s northern wing, accessed from the nave via a cloister hallway, contains the library&#x27;s offices as well as three major rooms: a lecture hall, the Memorabilia Room, and the Rare Book Room. The Memorabilia Room hosts temporary exhibitions of Yale&#x27;s archival collections and university history, and serves as an antechamber to the 120-seat lecture hall.

The Rare Book Room, designed after English Jacobean architecture, was built to allow library patrons to browse Yale&#x27;s collection of rare books and manuscripts. A vaulted, octagonal chapel behind the room was specially constructed to house a copy of the Gutenberg Bible. The completion of the Beinecke Library in 1963 provided a more secure, climate-controlled repository for rare books, and the room and chapel now serve as a browsing room for the library&#x27;s Manuscripts &amp; Archives department.

===Courtyard===
The library originally had two courtyards designed and landscaped by Beatrix Farrand. In 1997, the western courtyard was enclosed and renovated to become the Irving S. Gilmore Music Library. Sterling&#x27;s remaining courtyard, named the Selin Courtyard, features motifs from the history of printing.

==Decoration==
The library is one of the most elaborate buildings on the Yale campus. Rogers commissioned artisans, including stained glass artist G. Owen Bonawit and blacksmith Samuel Yellin, who worked with Rogers on many of his buildings, sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan, and painter Eugene Savage. The building&#x27;s exterior is decorated with stone gargoyles, reliefs, and inscriptions. The nave is the most ornately decorated library interior, although ornamental features, particularly stained-glass windows, can be found in nearly every room in the building.

===Entrance relief===

A relief above the library&#x27;s main entrance symbolizes the scholarly achievements of ancient civilizations. It is the work of architectural sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan, who executed a design produced by Lee Lawrie. The scene depicts Cro-Magnon, Egyptian, Assyrian, Hebrew, Arab, Greek, Mayan, and Chinese scholars in low relief, with inscriptions from major works in each writing system. At center is a medieval scholar, and directly above the doors are symbolic representations of major civilizations, which include a Phoenician ship, a Babylonian lamassu and the Capitoline wolf of Rome.

===&quot;Alma Mater&quot; mural===

At the western end of the nave is a fresco painted by Eugene Savage, a professor in the Yale School of Art and Architecture. Savage titled it &quot;The Imagination that Directs the University&#x27;s Spiritual and Intellectual Efforts,&quot; but it is commonly known as the &quot;Alma Mater&quot; mural for its depiction of a personified &quot;University.&quot; Savage, an expert in Early Renaissance techniques, painted the mural in his characteristic style, an Art Deco interpretation of traditional Renaissance composition. Surrounding &quot;Alma Mater&quot; are personifications of academic disciplines.

===Stained glass===
680 unique stained glass panels by G. Owen Bonawit adorn the nave, reading rooms, offices, and tower of the library. Eighty decorate the nave, depicting scenes from the history of Yale and New Haven. Most reading rooms have stained glass panels that represent themes from their subject matter. Bonawit&#x27;s firm also designed over 2,000 small outline images to inset in windows without stained glass panes. Although Sterling contains the most in number, Bonawit&#x27;s panels can be found in many of Yale&#x27;s Gothic Revival buildings of the same period, including the Sterling Law Building, the Hall of Graduate Studies, and the residential colleges.

===Other notable ornament===

In the nave, ten high relief stone panels by Chambellan depict the history of the Yale University Library up to 1865. Bosses on the nave&#x27;s ceiling depict writing implements. Samuel Yellin, the blacksmith who shaped most of the ironwork for Yale&#x27;s Gothic buildings, created handwrought elevator doors for the Stacks depicting major trades, as well as ironwork and gates for the building. Other decorative stonework by Chambellan—gargoyles, corbels, and reliefs—can be found throughout the building. While most of his works depict scholarship and university life, several are humorous interpretations of the lives of students and librarians.

Several tributes in the library commemorate pioneering graduates of the university. A portrait of Edward Bouchet, one of Yale&#x27;s earliest African American graduates, hangs in the nave&#x27;s transept. Near the Franke Family Reading Room is a statue of Yung Wing, the first Chinese graduate of Yale. In 2016 a portrait of the first seven women to receive Ph.D.s from Yale, which those seven women all did in 1894, was placed in the library. The women include Mary Augusta Scott, Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Margaretta Palmer, Charlotte Fitch Roberts, Cornelia H.B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, and Laura Johnson Wylie. The portrait is the first painting hanging in the library to have women as subjects. Brenda Zlamany was the artist.

==Collections==

===Catalog===

The large majority of materials in Sterling are housed in the bookstacks, which are contained in the building&#x27;s tower. The bookstacks use two classification systems: the Yale Library system and the Library of Congress system. Adopted in the 1890s, the non-standard Yale system became cumbersome and inefficient for cataloging. Though replaced in 1970 by the Library of Congress system, many of the 5.7 million volumes held by the library at that time remain filed in the Yale system. The card catalogs in the nave once contained as many as 9.5 million cards, sorted in 8,700 trays.

===Manuscripts &amp; Archives===
Manuscripts &amp; Archives is the primary archival repository of the university, housing Yale memorabilia, university archives, historical manuscripts, and personal papers donated to the university. Though the archive uses the former Rare Book Room as its primary reading room, most of the collection is held off-site. Significant materials within Manuscripts &amp; Archives include the papers of Charles Lindbergh, Eero Saarinen, Eli Whitney, John Maley and the audio library of Osama bin Laden. The archives hosts a notable collection of diplomatic papers, including those of Dean Acheson, Henry Kissinger, Henry Stimson, and Cyrus Vance.

===Music Library===

Audio, visual, and paper materials related to music are retained in the Irving S. Gilmore Music Library, a facility converted from one of Sterling&#x27;s courtyards. The collection was established in the mid-19th century under Gustave J. Stoeckel, and was expanded by the acquisition of Lowell Mason&#x27;s papers and library in 1873. Its collections include one of the largest catalogs of recordings and scores in the United States, including the papers of Charles Ives, Carl Ruggles, Quincy Porter, Horatio Parker, Virgil Thomson, Clarence Watters, Richard Donovan, and J. Rosamond Johnson. The collection was moved to Sprague Hall of the Yale School of Music in 1955, then to Sterling after the Gilmore Library was completed in 1997.

===Film Archive===
The seventh floor of Sterling Memorial Library holds the Yale Film Archive, which holds collections of more than 7,000 film elements, including hundreds of unique 35mm and 16mm prints and original negatives, as well as more than 50,000 items in its circulating video collection. The archive, which grew from a small collection of 16mm prints acquired for use in teaching film in 1968, was formally established in 1982 and moved to Sterling in 2021. Its collections include original material by filmmakers including Mary Ellen Bute, Frank Mouris, Warrington Hudlin, and Willie Ruff. The Film Archive collects, preserves, and screens films in its collection, and is an Associate of the International Federation of Film Archives.

===Special collections===
The library houses several special collections:
* The Yale Babylonian Collection, the largest collection of Babylonian cuneiform writing in North America;
* The library of the American Oriental Society, the oldest American learned society for area studies, whose catalog has been housed at Yale since 1855;
* The Map Collection, a collection of over 200,000 print maps as well as Geographic Information Systems data;
* Arts of the Book, a variety of materials related to printing, bookbinding, woodblock, and graphic design.
* The &quot;Near East Collection holds one of the most comprehensive assemblies of Arabic and Islamic studies materials in the US.&quot;

===Major editorial projects===
* The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, a project founded in 1954 to collect and publish all the papers of Benjamin Franklin. The library received a major donation of Franklin&#x27;s papers when Sterling opened in 1935, and the collection formed the basis of Yale professor Edmund Morgan&#x27;s best-selling biography of Franklin.
*The Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, a collection of about 4,500 video-recorded testimonies from witness and survivors of the Holocaust, deposited in the library in 1981.
* Boswell Editions, an edited collection of the papers and publications of Scottish lawyer James Boswell, the major biographer of the famous 18th century English literary figure Samuel Johnson.
* Wing STC Revision Project, an effort begun in 1933 by Yale librarian Donald Wing to compile a Short-Title Catalogue, a bibliographic reference for books printed in England and its colonies between 1641 and 1700.

<text>CHNO-FM is a Canadian radio station broadcasting at 103.9 FM in Sudbury, Ontario. Owned and operated by Stingray Radio, the station is branded on-air as &quot;Rewind 103.9&quot; with a classic hits format.

==History==
The station began broadcasting on June 24, 1947 on AM 1440. It was a bilingual radio station, airing programming in both English and French, and was an affiliate of both CBC Radio&#x27;s Dominion Network and Radio-Canada. It was operated by &quot;Sudbury Broadcasting&quot;, a company owned by F. Baxter Ricard and his wife Alma Ricard, and was the first bilingual radio station in Canada outside of Quebec. 

CHNO&#x27;s studios and offices were located at 166 Elm Street West in Sudbury, while the RCA transmitter and two towers were situated in the McFarlane Lake district of Sudbury, along Burwash Road, on part of Lot 3, Concession 6, Broder Township.

In 1952, the station was the subject of controversy when Ricard refused to permit Local 598 of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers to purchase airtime on the station for a labour-oriented news program, on the grounds that the program represented &quot;Communist propaganda&quot;. His objection had less to do with the program&#x27;s spoken content and more to do with the host&#x27;s choice of interstitial music between segments, including a song by Paul Robeson.

On November 9, 1954, CHNO moved to AM 900.

In 1957, Ricard opened CFBR on AM 550 as a full-time French-language station, and CHNO switched to full-time English. The licensing of CFBR, which took over the Radio-Canada affiliation from CHNO, made Sudbury Broadcasting the first commercial broadcaster in Canada licensed to operate two AM radio stations in the same city. In 1962, the station became independent following the dissolution of the Dominion Network. On December 31, 1969, CFBR and CHNO swapped frequencies, CHNO moving to 550 and CFBR taking over the 900 slot. On May 14, 1976, the CRTC denied an application by Sudbury Broadcasting Co. Ltd. to change CHNO&#x27;s frequency from 550 kHz to 570 kHz.

In 1979, CHNO and CFBR moved out of their Elm Street building and moved to their new location at 295 Victoria Street in the old King George School building to accommodate a new FM station. 

In 1980, Sudbury Broadcasting launched a new FM station CJMX. That same year, CHNO received approval to increase daytime power from 10,000 watts to 50,000 watts with the nighttime power to remain at 10,000 watts and would remain on 550 kHz. Also in 1980, Ricard also became a major shareholder in Mid-Canada Communications. Sudbury Broadcasting continued to operate independently, although it was eventually merged into Mid-Canada Radio in 1985. In 1990, Mid-Canada sold the stations to Pelmorex. Following this sale, CFBR adopted the new call letters CHYC.

In the 1970s and 1980s, CHNO was Northern Ontario&#x27;s most listened-to and most influential radio station, broadcasting a Top 40 format branded as &quot;55 CHNO&quot;, &quot;Rock Radio CHNO 55&quot;, &quot;Sudbury&#x27;s Best Rock&quot;, and &quot;Sudbury&#x27;s Hit Music Leader&quot;, &quot;NO55&quot; (pronounced &quot;N-oh fifty-five&quot;). However, the 1990 launch of CJRQ ended CHNO&#x27;s dominance, and on July 6, 1992 at 6:00 AM, CHNO flipped to an oldies format as &quot;Oldies 55&quot;. After struggling through a variety of formats, including classic rock as &quot;AM 55 The Crusher&quot; in 1994, country and talk in 1995 and 1996, the station reverted to oldies in 1997. Former program director Scott Jackson, now the manager of CJLF-FM in Barrie, has stated that CHNO and CJMX were the most neglected stations in the entire Pelmorex corporate family during the time that he worked there, despite being the network&#x27;s nominal flagships. Also in 1997, CHNO, CHYC and CJMX-FM moved out of their 295 Victoria Street building into a new location at 493-B Barrydowne Road, where CHNO still remains to this day.

In 1998, Pelmorex sold CJMX to Telemedia. The following year, Pelmorex sold CHNO and CHYC to Haliburton Broadcasting Group.

===Switch to FM===
Haliburton applied to the CRTC to move both CHNO and CHYC to FM, which was approved on August 31, 1999. In November 1999, CHNO dropped its oldies format and adopted its new CHR/Top 40 format and &quot;Z103&quot; branding on the old AM frequency a few months before the station made its official move to FM. CHNO began testing its 103.9 FM signal just days before officially launching on February 3, 2000. The FM and AM signals aired simultaneously for a few weeks, and on February 29, the AM signal was closed permanently.

The station was originally licensed to broadcast at 100 kWs, but because of transmitter interference to the Greater Sudbury Airport the station&#x27;s license was permanently amended to 11 kilowatts.

As &quot;Z103&quot;, the station recovered significantly in the local BBM ratings, jumping to a 22.1 per cent share of the local radio audience in 2000 from just 7.3 per cent in the 1999 ratings book.

As a Top 40 station, Z103 hosted live-to-air programs from area nightclubs in the city, as well as syndicated shows such as the &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot;, &quot;American Top 40&quot; and &quot;Canadian Hit 30 Countdown&quot;. Positioning slogans during the Top 40 period included &quot;Sudbury&#x27;s Best Music&quot;, &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot; and &quot;Sudbury&#x27;s #1 Hit Music Station.&quot;

On November 9, 2001, Haliburton sold CHNO to Newcap Broadcasting. Despite no longer having common ownership, however, CHYC and CHNO continued to operate from the same studio facility at 493 Barrydowne Road in Sudbury until 2009.

Newcap and Rogers Media soon entered into a joint sales agreement, under which Rogers held responsibility for advertising sales on CHNO as well as on its own CJRQ, CIGM and CJMX. In 2002, however, Friends of Canadian Broadcasting filed a brief with the CRTC opposing the station&#x27;s license renewal — FCB took the position that in practice, the agreement was extending well beyond advertising sales and into both program production and news gathering, and thus constituted an illegal &quot;de facto&quot; local management agreement. On January 31, 2005, the CRTC disallowed the agreement, ruling in its license renewals for the four stations that the agreement must be terminated no later than May 31 of that year.

==Big Daddy==
At 12:00 AM on January 1, 2006, with little or no warning, the station flipped to a variety hits format branded as &quot;Big Daddy 103.9&quot; with slogan &quot;Playing Anything&quot;, ending another era of Top 40 music in the Sudbury market. The last song on &quot;Z&quot; was &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem, while the first song on &quot;Big Daddy&quot; was &quot;Start Me Up&quot; by The Rolling Stones. General manager Darlene Palmer said the station wanted to offer Sudbury &quot;music you can dance to, sing to, date to, divorce to.&quot; Some promotional bumpers for the station featured a stiff-voiced character representing &quot;Big Daddy&quot; himself. The stiff-voiced character was replaced by a new one around the middle of 2008.

In the first quarter BBM ratings for 2006, CHNO&#x27;s first ratings book under the Big Daddy format, the station regained the #1 status in the Sudbury market for the first time since 1990. However, the move was controversial with some of the station&#x27;s prior listeners, and in July 2006, just seven months after flipping CHNO to the adult hits format, Newcap applied to the CRTC for a new contemporary hit radio station in the Sudbury market. In the application, Newcap stated that its market research found that a contemporary hit radio station could only be profitable in the market as one station within an ownership cluster, and not as a standalone entity. However, the application was denied by the CRTC on July 12, 2007.

The denial of the proposed CHR/Top 40 station also became controversial, in part because the station that was licensed, CICS-FM, duplicated the format of an existing station in the market, Rogers&#x27; CIGM. In July 2008, however, Newcap announced a deal to acquire CIGM from Rogers in exchange for CFDR in Halifax. Both CIGM and CFDR were the sole remaining AM stations in their respective markets, and in both cases the current owner already had the maximum permitted number of FM stations in the applicable market, whereas the acquirer only had a single FM station. Both companies applied to move the stations to FM as part of the trade. This deal was approved on November 24, 2008.

On June 25, 2009, Newcap received approval from the CRTC to increase CHNO-FM&#x27;s effected radiated power from 11,000 watts to 100,000 watts, to increase the station&#x27;s antenna height and to relocate the transmitter. On August 17, 2009, the station increased their power to 100,000 watts the same day CHNO-FM&#x27;s sister station CIGM-FM began on-air tests at 93.5 FM.

==2010 format change==
On May 21, 2010, at 12:00 AM without warning, the station dropped adult hits and switched to its current classic hits format as &quot;Rewind 103.9&quot;, playing 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s music with the slogan &quot;Sudbury&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. The first song after the change was Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll&quot;. In 2011, CHNO-FM aired syndicated programs such as the 1970s reruns of &quot;American Top 40&quot; with &quot;Casey Kasem&quot;, the &quot;Classic Countdown&quot; with &quot;Dick Bartley&quot; and the &quot;Donny Osmond show&quot;. The syndicated daily radio show, &quot;Daily Dees&quot;, hosted by Rick Dees was heard each weeknight. The station, like most classic hits stations, has evolved to playing more 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s and currently uses the slogan &quot;70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s and More!&quot;.

Despite the different branding, the station is closely aligned with Stingray&#x27;s Boom FM-branded stations, with similar logo designs and partial sharing of programs and personalities.

<doc id="1233456" wikidata="Q3437819" url="?curid=1233456" title="Rock music in Belgium">
<text>Belgian rock refers to rock music produced in Belgium or written and performed by Belgian musicians. It was originally inspired by rock and roll music from America and the United Kingdom in the 1960s, but later evolved to be influenced by other genres including alternative rock and electronic music. Because Belgium is a federal state with strong cultural identities - a French-speaking area in the southern region of Wallonia as well as a Dutch-speaking population in the north region of Flanders - Belgian rock music uses these two national languages, as well as the English language.

The history of Belgian rock echoes that of European rock: after the 1950s, during which rock pioneers introduced the new genre, rock evolved further under the influences of beat music and pop music. During the 1970s, hard rock and progressive rock expressed new forms of rock, and punk rock signalled a return to the simplicity of rock and roll with Belgian bands like The Kids, Red Zebra, and Hubble Bubble. During the 1980s and 90s, indie rock and alternative rock developed with an important scene in Antwerp; Deus was a particularly successful band from the Antwerp alternative scene.

==History==

===1955-1963: The introduction of rock and roll to Belgium===
In Belgium, as in Europe in general, rock and roll began to spread at the end of the 1950s, in part due to the presence of American troops stationed in Europe in the post-war period. Among the first rock and roll songs to arrive in Belgium was &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (Decca, 1954) by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. In 1956 the film of the same name was released in Belgium, which kicked off a rock and roll craze. Among the new pioneers of rock in Belgium there were &quot;Rocking Harry&quot; and &quot;Shorty Lee Smith and the Wildcats&quot; who began playing between 1956 and 1957. In issue 25 of the newly formed music magazine &quot;Juke Box&quot; the first concert of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels was announced on October 30, 1958. In 1959, Burt Blanca and the King Creoles released their &quot;Oh, Carol! / I Love You So&quot; (Hebra Records), &quot;Big Brown &amp; The Gamblers&quot; followed this hit with &quot;My Testament&quot; (Palette, 1961), &quot;Clark Richard and his Tropical Stars&quot; released &quot;Queen Of Love / Hot Rock Beat&quot; (His Master&#x27;s Voice, 1961) and Les Frangins released &quot;Ye Youpi / Changhai&quot; (Barclay, 1961).

 Surf music and instrumental rock were influential for early Belgian rock music, brought to Belgium by UK bands like The Shadows. In 1957, the Belgian band The Jokers published their first 7&quot; entitled &quot;Drie Dagen En Drie Nachten&quot; (CID). This was followed by the remake of the Belgian folk song &quot;Ik zag Cecilia komen&quot; with the new title &quot;Cecilia Rock&quot; (Philips, 1960). Among the many songs by the Jokers that later achieved popular success in Belgium were &quot;Ronny Boy&quot; (Discostar, 1963), &quot;Tabou&quot; (Discostar, 1964), and &quot;Gemini Boogie&quot; (Arcade Records, 1965). An instrumental rock band, The Cousins, released a rock version of the folk song &quot;Kili Watch&quot; (Palette, 1960).
Other important releases of this period include the Shakespears (&quot;Shake it over&quot;, 1965), the Pebbles (&quot;Seven horses in the sky&quot;, 1968), and the Wallace Collection (&quot;Daydream&quot;, 1969). Other notable artists got evolved in the rock scene, including blues and folk musicians like the Antwerps protest singer Ferre Grignard who released the songs &quot;Ring Ring&quot; and &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot; in 1966.

===Post-British Invasion developments in the 1960s===
====Between Rhythm &amp; Blues, Beat, and Garage rock====

In the mid-1960s, as a result of the British invasion, Belgian bands began to create a homegrown version of garage rock. The beat band &quot;The Pebbles&quot; were one of the most iconic bands of this movement. In 1965, they released a series of 7&quot; singles -- &quot;Let&#x27;s Say Goodbye / Love Me Again&quot; (CBS), &quot;Love Me Again / It&#x27;s Alright With Me Now&quot; (Dot Records), &quot;It&#x27;s Allright With Me / Forever More&quot; (CBS), and &quot;Huma - La La La La&quot; (Président) -- which were also popular in Spain, France, and Italy. &quot;The Pebbles&quot; performed on the Dutch TV show &quot;Fenklup&quot; on June 7, 1968.

In 1965 Les Godasses Verte released the 7&quot; &quot;La Salade / Le Panier A Salade&quot; (CBS). Les Night Rockers released &quot;En Public Du Golf Drouot&quot; (Golf Drouot), &quot;I Can Tell&quot; (Barclay, 1965), and &quot;Dance To The Rock&quot; (Golf Drouot, 1966). The band Sylvester&#x27;s Team released &quot;It Reminds Me (Louis XVI)&quot; (Roover Records, 1965) and &quot;Beautiful Day / Hurt Me No More&quot; (Roover Records, 1966). In 1968 they changed their name to Bird and the Bees and released their 7&quot; &quot;Tiger Dans&quot; (Disques Vogue).

Born from the offshoot of the Belgian rock band Les Ombres, a band named The Klan released a series of singles and an album entitled &quot;Join Us&quot; (Palette, 1967); The Klan opened for the Rolling Stones at their Paris concert on April 10, 1967.

====Psychedelic rock====

For Belgium, 1967 was also the year in which the new psychedelic rock developed, as evidenced by The Pebbles 7&quot; release &quot;I Got To Sing / You&#x27;re Better Believe It&quot; (Barclay, 1967), their single &quot;Seven Horses In The Sky&quot; (Barclay, 1968), and their self-titled album (1969). The band shared the stage with Jimi Hendrix and with the Small Faces in a concert in Paris. In 1967, The Shakes began to develop a blues sound with strong psychedelic influences, clearly seen in &quot;Come On-A My House / Dust My Blues&quot; (Voom) and &quot;Shoot Me Baby / You&#x27;ve Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot; (Ronnex Records, 1968). Waterloo released the 7&quot; &quot;Meet Again&quot; (Disques Vogue) in 1969 and &quot;Plastic Mind&quot; (Disques Vogue) in 1970. The same year, Paul&#x27;s Collection released &quot;Man / Music Is My Life&quot; (RCA, 1970) followed by four 7&quot; singles.

===The new subgenres of the 70s===
====Progressive rock====

Indie rock bands like TC Matic and De Kreuners, and many punk rock-dark wave bands like Nacht und Nebel, the Paranoiacs and Siglo XX, began to draw a significant audience, and started to release songs in their mother language. Some, like the &quot;eurorock&quot; band Machiavel and the pop/punk singer Plastic Bertrand, were also managed in a more commercial approach.

Among the notable bands with a strong jazz rock influences are the Cos and the Kandahar. The Cos debuted in 1973 with the album &quot;Postaeolian Train Robbery&quot; (Plus Records, 1974). The Kandahar debuted with the 7&quot; single &quot;Survivin&#x27; Boogie / The Dark Hole Rag&quot; (Dwarf, 1974) and then released their first album &quot;In The Court Of Catherina Squeezer&quot; (Dwarf, 1975). The Esperanto Rock Orchestra achieved international fame with a self-titled album released by A&amp;M Records. Other notable bands include Tideline, Magenta, Machiavel, the Isopoda, the Nessie, the Phylter, the Flyte, and the Dragon. The symphonic prog rock band, Banzai released &quot;Hora Nata&quot; in 1974 on the Dutch label Delta.

====Hard &amp; heavy====
At the end of the 1960s, a hard rock / heavy metal style of rock emerged that was characterized by a dense, powerful sound, with rhythmic bass lines in the foreground, highly amplified distortion, guitar solos, emphatic rhythms, and an overall high volume. Among the pioneer bands of this genre in Belgium are Jenghiz Khan who released the seminal album &quot;Well Cut&quot; (Barclay). In 1971, Irish Coffee released a single entitled &quot;Carry On / Child&quot; (Triangle) and then a self-titled album in the same year.

===Proto-punk, punk and new wave===
====Punk rock====
The Belgian rock scene spawned many proto-punk and glam rock bands including Vacation who released the singles &quot;I Can&#x27;t Bear Pain&quot; (Sandro, 1975) and &quot;Whatch What You Do&quot; (Sandro, 1977). Another example of proto-punk in Belgium is the band Blast who released the 7&quot; &quot;Damned Flame / Hope&quot; (Majestic, 1974). Beginning in 1976-77 a national punk rock scene began in Belgium. One of the first punk bands in Belgium were The Kids, who were founded in 1976, and released the single 7&quot; &quot;No Monarchy / Rock Over Belgium / The City Is Dead&quot; in 1978; later that year they released the albums &quot;The Kids&quot; (Fontana, 1978) and &quot;Naughty kids&quot; (Fontana, 1978). Other bands of the first Belgian punk rock wave include Red Zebra, Hubble Bubble, Plastic Bertrand, The Employees, and Perverted by Desire.

====New wave====

Among the Belgian new wave bands that emerged following the first wave of punk were pop bands like TC Matic of the singer Arno, De Kreuners, The Bowling Balls, Nacht und Nebel and Walter Verdin. New wave also included electronic rock bands like Telex, as well as bands inspired by songwriting like &quot;Rick Tubbax And The Taxi&#x27;s&quot;, and Bubblegum pop artists like Lio. This period also included &quot;funk wave&quot; bands like Allez Allez and 2 Belgen.

====Post-punk====
Following the first wave of punk, more politically motivated post-punk bands emerged. These bands tended to have a harder sound than new wave bands, or adopted darker formulas and often linked to countercultures. Examples of post-punk in Belgium include Aroma Di Amore, Lavvi Ebbel, De Brassers, Siglo XX, A Noh Rodeo, Company of State, Mensen Blaffen, The Names, Jo Lemaire + Flouze, The Breath of Life, and Poésie Noire.

===The rock of the 80s and 90s===
====Synth rock====
Many of the progressive rock bands of the 70s carried out their first experiments with synthesizers. But it was in the late &#x27;70s that many bands began to develop a Synth pop and Synth rock sound. Among these, the most successful Belgian band was Machiavel, which was categorized at the time as Eu-rock.

====Cold wave====
The origins of cold wave lie in the first wave punk bands of France and Belgium; this distinctive post-punk sound was the result of these bands&#x27; use of cheap portable synthesizers. Coldwave bands often mixed Darkwave sounds with German-style Krautrock electronics, obtaining often cold and minimal sound results. The bands in this genre include Aimless Device, Parade Ground, Siglo XX, and Poésie Noire.

====Gothic rock====
From the darker side of the post-punk scene of the late &#x27;70s, between coldwave, darkwave and industrial music, an autonomous scene of gothic rock with its own subculture grew in popularity in the 1980s. Among the Belgian bands that contributed to this scene were The Breath of Life, Siglo XX, De Brassers, The Names, and Poésie Noire.

====Electronic body music====
Belgium played a fundamental role in the development of electronic body music (EBM), a musical genre of post music -industrial which mixed among other things industrial music, electronic music, dance music and Synthpunk. Among the synthesizers that defined the style in its early phase were the Korg MS-20, the Roland SH-101, the ARP Odyssey, the Emulator II, along with several Oberheim and Yamaha models. The most important bands of early Belgian EBM were Front 242, Klinik and The Neon Judgement.

===Indie rock===
With the emergence of new beat in the 1990s, Belgium, especially Flanders, experienced a profound turning point in electronic music. As a reaction to the mainstream attitude of the new beat scene, an alternative rock and indie rock scene developed, along with a series of festivals, often put on by local youth organizations. The festival Humo&#x27;s Rock Rally became particularly prominent. Although &quot;Radio 21&quot; was created in 1981 (two years prior to its Flemish counterpart Studio Brussel), the Dour Festival has only turned into a resolutely indie festival in the middle of the nineties.
A particularly rich indie rock scene emerged in Antwerp, where dEUS became a highly successful band. Mauro Pawlowski and Rudy Trouvé, members of dEUS, are key figures of the Antwerp scene. Pawlowski has played in numerous bands, including Mitsoobishy Jacson, Kiss My Jazz, Shadowgraphic City, The Love Substitutes, Othin Sake, The Parallels, Club Moral, Archetipi of the MultiSabanas, I Hate Camera, and Evil Superstars, as well as pursuing a solo career. Trouvé played with Dead Man Ray, Gore Slut, I Hate Camera, Kiss My Jazz, The Love Substitutes, Rudy Trouvé Sextet/Settet, Rudy and the Unforgettable Wally&#x27;s. Other well-known indie rock bands from Antwerp include Zita Swoon, Dead Man Ray, K&#x27;s Choice, Admiral Freebee, A Brand, and Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung.
The indie rock scene spread throughout Belgium. Notable musicians and groups in Belgian indie rock include Zita Swoon, Noordkaap, Venus, Sharko, Dead Man Ray, Admiral Freebee, A Brand, Die Anarchistische Abendunterhaltung, Gorki, Millionaire, Soulwax, An Pierlé, The Black Box Revelation, Novastar, Milow, Arid, An Pierlé, Das Pop, Admiral Freebee, Goose, Ozark Henry, and Hooverphonic.
In 1981, the pioneer noise band Club Moral formed in Antwerp.

As in most northern Europe countries, the hard rock-metal scene was maturing. In Belgium its first iconic groups were Kleptomania and Irish Coffee. In the 1990s, the metal band Channel Zero achieved wide success.

===From 2000 onwards===
The 2000s mark the arrival of a new uninhibited Belgian (mainly French) scene started by Venus, and then by Girls in Hawaii, Ghinzu, The Telrs, Hollywood Porn Stars, and Sharko. Other notable Belgian bands active during this period include Arid, Vive la Fête, Triggerfinger, and Absynthe Minded.

<doc id="1233457" wikidata="Q421563" url="?curid=1233457" title="Monellin">
<text>Monellin, a sweet protein, was discovered in 1969 in the fruit of the West African shrub known as serendipity berry (&quot;Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii&quot;); it was first reported as a carbohydrate. The protein was named in 1972 after the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, U.S.A., where it was isolated and characterized.

== Protein composition ==
Monellin&#x27;s molecular weight is 10.7 kDa. It has two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains: an A chain sequence with 44 amino acid residues, and a B chain with 50 residues.

Monellin chain A (44 AA): 

Monellin chain B (50 AA): 

Amino acid sequence of the sweet protein monellin adapted from Swiss-Prot biological database of protein.

Monellin has a secondary structure consisting of five beta-strands that form an antiparallel beta-sheet and a 17-residue alpha-helix.

In its natural form, monellin is composed of the two chains shown above (), but the protein is unstable at high temperatures or at extremes of pH. To enhance its stability, single-chain monellin proteins were created in which the two natural chains are joined via a Gly-Phe dipeptide linker. This modified version of the protein (MNEI) has been studied using NMR and X-ray diffraction.

In addition to its secondary structure, four stably bound sulfate ions were located on the monellin protein, three on the concave face of the protein and one on the convex face of the protein. The sulfate ion on the convex face of the protein is of particular interest because it lies adjacent to a patch of positive surface potential, which may be important in electrostatic interactions with the negative T1R2-T1R3 sweet taste protein receptor.

== Sweetness properties ==
Monellin is perceived as sweet by humans and some Old World primates, but is not preferred by other mammals. The relative sweetness of monellin varies from 800 to 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, depending on the sweet reference against which it is assessed. It is reported to be 1500-2000 times sweeter than a 7% sucrose solution on a weight basis
 and 800 times sweeter than sucrose when compared with a 5% sucrose solution on a weight basis.

Monellin has a slow onset of sweetness and lingering aftertaste. Like miraculin, monellin&#x27;s sweetness is pH-dependent; the protein is tasteless below pH 2 and above pH 9. Blending the sweet protein with bulk and/or intense sweeteners reduces the persistent sweetness and shows a synergistic sweet effect. Heat over 50 °C at low pH denatures monellin proteins, causing a loss of the sweetness.

So far, five high-intensity sweet proteins have been reported: monellin (1969), thaumatin (1972), pentadin (1989), mabinlin (1983) and brazzein (1994).

===As a sweetener ===
Monellin can be useful for sweetening some foods and drinks, as it is a protein readily soluble in water due to its hydrophilic properties. However, it may have limited application because it denatures under high temperature conditions, which makes it unsuitable for processed food. It may be relevant as noncarbohydrate tabletop sweetener, especially for individuals such as diabetics who must control their sugar intake.
In addition, monellin is costly to extract from the fruit and the plant is difficult to grow. Alternative production such as chemical synthesis and expression in micro-organisms are being investigated. For instance, monellin has been expressed successfully in yeast (&quot;Candida utilis&quot;) and synthesised by solid-phase method. The synthetic monellin produce by yeast was found to be 4000 times sweeter than sucrose when compared to 0.6% sugar solution.
Legal issues are the main barrier in its widespread use as a sweetener, as monellin has no legal status in the European Union or the United States. However, it is approved in Japan as a harmless additive, according to the List of Existing Food Additives issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (published in English by JETRO).

<text>USS &quot;Springer&quot; (SS-414) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy, named after the springer, a Grampus.

&quot;Springer&quot; was laid down on 3 October 1943 at Vallejo, Calif., by the Mare Island Navy Yard; launched on 3 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. M. S. Tisdale; and commissioned on 18 October 1944.

&quot;Springer&quot; sailed for San Diego on 3 December to conduct sea trials and shakedown training. After availability, she departed Mare Island for Hawaii on 8 January 1945 and arrived at Pearl Harbor the following week. On 4 February, she steamed to Guam; topped off her stores and oil; and, on 17 February, sailed for the Ryukyu Islands to begin her first war patrol.

== First patrol, February – March 1945 ==

&quot;Springer&quot; rode out several heavy storms and was driven down many times by enemy aircraft, but she finally spotted two Japanese warships on 11 March. The ships were at a range of 22,000 yards (20 km), steaming at , so the submarine surfaced to give chase. She was forced to submerge immediately by planes, and the pursuit was abandoned.

Later in the month, the submarine made radar contact with three ships, and she tracked the largest for three hours. When it was within torpedo range, she made a surface attack with four torpedoes. She scored two hits and the target began to burn. An hour later, &quot;Transport No. 18&quot; was still afloat so she sank it with another torpedo. The submarine returned to Guam on 25 March and was refitted by .

== Second patrol, April – May 1945 ==

&quot;Springer&quot;, , and sailed on 20 April for the Yellow Sea where they were to operate as a wolfpack. Eight days later, the pack checked Tomei Harbor on Fukue Shima. At 05:15, &quot;Springer&quot; sighted two ships hugging the coastline, but she found it impossible to close nearer than . She heard 14 explosions at approximately 06:30. &quot;Trepang&quot; had sunk &quot;Transport No. 146&quot; and was being depth charged by the victim&#x27;s escort. &quot;Springer&quot; headed out of the harbor, and sighted the escort returning alone. At 08:30, the submarine launched three torpedoes. The target went dead in the water; and, as the crew was abandoning ship, &quot;Springer&quot; fired another torpedo. It hit under the target&#x27;s No. 1 turret and blew off her bow. Two planes and two patrol craft approached, so &quot;Springer&quot; went deep and cleared the area, leaving Japan&#x27;s &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 17&quot; to sink.

&quot;Springer&quot; and &quot;Trepang&quot; contacted three targets on 30 April. The morning was very foggy, and the submarines decided to make a surface attack. Just as &quot;Springer&quot; reached a favorable firing position around noon, the fog suddenly lifted and left her exposed to a destroyer escort crossing her stern. The escort turned toward the submarine with all guns firing. &quot;Springer&quot; submerged, went deep, and rigged for silent running. Soon the first of 27 depth charges came down, and all were uncomfortably close. Speakers were knocked off the bulkhead, bulbs were smashed, and valves were lifted off their seats. When all was quiet, the submarine surfaced for a look as the fog closed in again. One more explosion was heard as &quot;Trepang&quot; sank the cargo ship &quot;Miho Maru&quot;.

On the night of 2 May, &quot;Springer&quot; attacked a ship and two small escorts with a spread of four torpedoes. She heard the first explode and then saw and heard two more hits which blew up and sank the frigate &quot;Ojika&quot;. The next night, she fired a spread of torpedoes at a ship making an antisubmarine sweep and sank the Japanese &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 25&quot;.

On 4 May, &quot;Springer&quot; sailed toward Honshū for lifeguard duty. No American pilots were sighted but, on 14 May, after watching a dogfight between a Japanese fighter and four of American carrier planes, she fished the dead enemy pilot from the water. After removing his papers, the submarine&#x27;s commanding officer returned his body to the sea. The submarine concluded her patrol at Guam, on 18 May, and was refitted by &quot;Proteus&quot;.

== Third patrol, June – July 1945 ==

&quot;Springer&quot; sailed to Saipan on 16 June and began her third war patrol the next day. This was a combination offensive and life guard patrol in the Tokyo Bay area. On 26 June, she rescued eight men from a downed B-29 and transferred them to . &quot;Springer&quot; and &quot;Trepang&quot; were notified that there was another crew down about distant. They raced to the scene and &quot;Springer&quot; rescued one airman while &quot;Trepang&quot; picked up seven. The airman was transferred to several days later. After an uneventful patrol in Kii Suido from 17 July to 23 July, the submarine sailed for Guam.

&quot;Springer&quot; was at Guam when hostilities with Japan ceased. She departed there on 17 August and headed for the west coast of the United States. She arrived at Mare Island on 5 September 1945 and shortly thereafter was attached to Mare Island Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet. In January 1947, her status was changed to in reserve, out of commission.

==Honors and awards==

&quot;Springer&quot; earned three battle stars for World War II service.

== &quot;Thomson&quot; (SS-22) ==
In April 1960, &quot;Springer&quot; was moved from Mare Island to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to be modernized in preparation for her transfer to the Republic of Chile. She was recommissioned on 24 September and the overhaul completed on 15 November. From 19 December 1960 to 19 January 1961, she held alongside and underway training for the Chilean crew.

&quot;Springer&quot; was decommissioned on 23 January 1961, transferred to the Republic of Chile, and commissioned in the Armada de Chile as &quot;Thomson&quot; (SS-22) on that date.

&quot;Springer&quot; was struck from the US Navy list on 1 September 1972, and sold to the government of Chile; she was stripped for spare parts for other submarines and her hulk sold for scrapping.

<text>Michael S. Schudson (born November 3, 1946) is professor of journalism in the graduate school of journalism of Columbia University and adjunct professor in the department of sociology. He is professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego. He is an expert in the fields such as journalism history, media sociology, political communication, and public culture.

==Biography==
Schudson grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He received his BA from Swarthmore College (1969) and his MA (1970) and PhD (1976) from Harvard University in sociology. He taught at the University of Chicago from 1976 to 1980 and the University of California, San Diego, from 1980 to 2009. From 2006 to 2009, he was on the faculty of both University of California, San Diego, and Columbia. He has been working full-time at Columbia since 2009.

Schudson has received major awards such as a Guggenheim Fellowship, a residential fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, and a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; fellowship. On being named a MacArthur fellow in 1990, the foundation identified him as &quot;an interpreter of public culture and of collective or civic memory&quot;. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen in 2014.

Schudson lives in New York City and is married to communication scholar Julia Sonnevend.

==Work==
Schudson is the author of seven books and editor of three others concerning the history and sociology of American journalism, the history of United States citizenship and political participation, advertising, popular culture, book publishing, and cultural memory. His books, &quot;Discovering the News&quot; (Basic Books, 1978), &quot;Advertising, the Uneasy Persuasion&quot; (Basic Books, 1984), &quot;The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life&quot; (Free Press, 1998), &quot;The Sociology of News&quot; (W. W. Norton, 2003, 2011), and &quot;Why Democracies Need an Unlovable Press&quot; (Polity Press, 2008); all have been published in Chinese translation. His other works include &quot;Watergate in American Memory&quot; (Basic Books, 1992); &quot;The Power of News&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1995), &quot;Reading the News&quot; (Pantheon, 1986), co-edited with Robert K. Manoff; &quot;Rethinking Popular Culture&quot; (University of California Press, 1991), co-edited with Chandra Mukerji; and &quot;The Enduring Book&quot; (vol. 5 of The History of the Book in America, University of North Carolina Press, 2009), co-edited with David Paul Nord and Joan Shelley Rubin.

His books are reviewed in both specialized and general publications. The &quot;Journal of American History&quot; judged &quot;The Good Citizen&quot; (1998) to be &quot;relevant, imaginative, and determined to face facts&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; urged all Americans to read it. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (UK) called &quot;Why Democracies Need an Unlovable Press&quot; (2008) &quot;eloquent and wise&quot;.

Schudson publishes in both academic and general-interest journals. In the Winter 2019 edition of the Columbia Journalism Review he authored a history of &quot;trust&quot; issues related to journalistic reporting in the United States, a historical review of such issues, and the origin of the term, &quot;the media&quot;, that is entitled, &quot;The Fall, Rise, and Fall of Media Trust&quot;. He offered an assessment of whether and how trust may be cultivated by journalists and publishers. Its subtitle is, &quot;There are worse things than being widely disliked&quot;.

He is co-author, with Leonard Downie Jr., of a report on the future of news, &quot;The Reconstruction of American Journalism&quot; (2009), that was sponsored by the Columbia Journalism School.

<doc id="1233480" wikidata="Q3437823" url="?curid=1233480" title="Chilean rock">
<text>Chilean rock is rock music and its corresponding subgenres produced in Chile or by Chileans. Chilean rock lyrics are usually sung in Spanish so can be considered as part of rock en español, although they are sometimes sung in English as well.

Rock music was first produced in Chile in the late 1950s by bands that imitated, and sometimes translated, international rock and roll hits from the U.S. This movement was known as the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; (New Wave). Although original bands started to emerge as well in the early 1960s.

During the second half of the 1960s, after the success of rock and roll music, the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song) and &quot;&quot; (Latin American fusion) genres were born in Chile, bringing to fame artists like Violeta Parra and Víctor Jara as extremely influential folk singers, or Los Jaivas and Congreso who were more instrumentally elaborated.

In the 1970s, however, there was a decline in the country&#x27;s rock scene as a result of the military dictatorship imposed by the 1973 coup d&#x27;état. From 1973 to 1990, all forms of rock music were prohibited (along with an important part of the cultural life), causing stagnation in the music industry. Nevertheless, an underground scene grew up with new genres such as heavy metal, punk and new wave music. Los Prisioneros were the most outstanding band of this era.

The 1990s saw the beginning of a revival for Chilean rock music, with several Chilean bands finding international success along with the growth of many rock subgenres such as alternative rock, pop rock, funk rock, reggae, grunge, britpop or latin rock becoming commercially successful. Los Tres became the most iconic rock band of this era, alongside La Ley in pop.

In the early 21st century, many more independent artists have become increasingly popular, while the previous ones have consolidated generating a cultural legacy of wide variety and trajectory. Synth pop, neo-folk rock, latin rock, alternative rock and pop rock are among the most successful subgenres of our times, although increasingly harder to categorize due to his indie and fusion nature.

Although frequently omitted from mass media preferring commercial foreign music instead, Chile has an extensive and rich rock culture, a permanent underground scene with hundreds of recognized bands, many niches of varied alternative sub-genres, as well as powerful regional scenes in Concepción and Valparaíso.

==Early rock and roll and &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; (1955–1965) ==

Rock and roll originated in the United States in the late 1940s and 1950s and expanded rapidly around the world. In the late 1950s, the first Chilean rock and roll bands emerged, largely imitating popular North American bands and performing rock and roll songs they were already hits in the U.S. Some of the first Chilean rock and roll bands included William Reb y sus Rock Kings, Harry Shaw y Los Truenos, which performed versions of Elvis Presley tracks in 1956–57 and would later go on to record versions of Beatles songs. However, William Reb felt he never received the credit he deserved for his part in Chilean rock and roll.

Chile&#x27;s first solo rock and roll artists were Peter Rock, with his Elvis Presley cover &quot;Baby, I Don&#x27;t Care/Something Happened&quot; (1959), and Nadia Milton, with her single &quot;Scobidou/Un poco&quot; (1960). 
The twist was also very popular in the 1950s, imported to Chile by the band Los Twisters with the singles &quot;Penas juveniles&quot;, &quot;Caprichitos&quot;, &quot;Me recordarás&quot;, &quot;Sueña&quot; and &quot;Mi secreto&quot;. In 1963, Los Twisters were voted the most popular band in Chile.

What began in the 1950s with imitations of American rock and roll soon developed into original music. La Orquesta Huambaly, with its roots in tropical music and jazz, were the first Chilean rock and roll band to compose original songs, including &quot;Huambaly rock&quot; (1957) and &quot;Rock del mono&quot; (Monkey Rock, 1958).

However, the first real commercial success story of the Nueva Ola scene was Los Ramblers, with their &quot;El Rock del Mundial&quot; (World Cup Rock) album released in May 1962 for the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile.
Los Ramblers opened the door to many other successful &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; artists. Some of the most well-known were: Peter Rock, Alan y sus Bates, Los Rockets, Buddy Richard, José Alfredo Fuentes, Antonio Prieto, Antonio Zabaleta, Cecilia Pantoja, Germán Casas, Ginette Acevedo, Gloria Benavides, Jorge Pedreros, Luis Dimas, Maitén Montenegro, Marcelo Hernández, Mirella Gilbert, Osvaldo Díaz, Germaín de la Fuente, Paolo Salvatore, Pat Henry, and Roberto Vicking Valdés. The Nueva Ola movement spread out of Santiago and throughout Chile, with bands like The New Demons forming in the northern city of Iquique, and The Blue Splendor, who formed – and still perform today – in Valparaíso.

The success of the Chilean &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; lasted until the mid-1960s, led by a second generation of musicians characterized by their original compositions, such as Buddy Richard, Patricio Renán, Los Ángeles Negros, José Alfredo Fuentes and Cecilia, considered by some critics as the greatest teen star of the mid-1960s.

The &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; has been criticized for foreignizing Chilean music because the style, lyrics and even names were heavily lifted from American and British culture. For some, the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot; movement is not considered the true origin of Chilean rock. They point instead to groups like Los Mac&#x27;s, Los Jockers and Los Vidrios Quebrados, who modelled themselves more on bands like The Rolling Stones and The Beatles, and &quot;were the first groupings who can really be identified as ‘rock made in Chile’, going further than the pop figures of the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot;.&quot; Bands that followed them were Los Picapiedras, Los Beat 4, Los Lark&#x27;s and Los Sonny&#x27;s one of the bands of future Florcita Motuda.

== Folk, &quot;Fusión Latinoamericana&quot; and psychedelic rock (1965–1973) ==

=== New chilean song ===
During the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s, after the strong American and British influences of the &quot;Nueva Ola&quot;, the Chilean rock movement began to return to the country&#x27;s indigenous and Latin American sounds looking for his own identity. A neo-folk movement developed with the aim of recovering traditional Chilean folk music and merging it with Latin American rhythms such as andean music. This would have its fullest expression in the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (the New Chilean Song), which grew up in parallel to other &quot;nueva canción&quot; movements across Latin America.

The &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; was characterized by a rediscovery of the instruments and sounds of historic Latin American traditions, and in particular the work of the artists Violeta Parra and Víctor Jara. Despite being mainly acoustic, both Parra and Jara were extremely influential in the development of a new, socially aware folk culture, and rock culture as well, which looked beyond traditional peasants themes and drew in contemporary issues from across Chile and Latin America. They tried to represent the reality of life for working-class people, instead of the idealized portrait traditionally seen in older folk music.

=== &quot;Fusión Latinoamericana&quot; ===
After the singer-songwriter approach of the Nueva Canción, Los Jaivas would lead the movement to a more progressive rock style. Forming in 1963 in Viña del Mar, Los Jaivas mixed rock with South American ancestral music to form what became known as folk progressive rock or &quot;Fusión Latinoamericana&quot;. The 1981 album &quot;Alturas de Macchu Picchu&quot; (based on lyrics from &quot;The Heights of Macchu Picchu&quot; by Pablo Neruda) is considered a South American rock masterpiece.
Congreso and Los Blops would follow this more elaborated way to make music and all three would be considered cornerstones in the definitive &quot;Chilenization of Rock&quot;. Congreso would last more than 50 years creating new music and becoming an iconic Chilean band. En Busca del Tiempo Perdido, Congregación, Combo Xingú, Sol y Medianoche, Kissing Spell/Embrujo, Frutos del País and Panal made the rest of the scene. Their style would be later known as &quot;Fusión latinoamericana&quot;.

=== Psychedelic rock and &quot;Piedra Roja&quot; festival ===

Psychedelic rock and blues rock came to Chile in the 1970s as it did elsewhere, influencing bands like Aguaturbia, Escombros and Sacros. Escombros contained former members of Los Mac&#x27;s and Los Jockers and sung in English, producing covers of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin among others. Sacros have been compared to The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with traces of, and released their first album, Sacros, days before the 1973 military coup. The album is now a collector&#x27;s item.

The famous Woodstock Festival in the U.S. inspired a similar event in Santiago, the Piedra Roja Festival of October 1970. The festival attracted many followers of the hippie movement and included performances by Los Blops and Los Jaivas, but poor organization led to a chaotic event which included sound problems and the presence of drugs and crime. The festival was, according to the National Digital Library of Chile, &quot;the moment in which the youth subculture, represented by rock, became a public issue and was reported in the media as a latent social problem. Young people were shown as liberal, drug-taking, long-haired rebels who were affecting mainstream society.&quot;

Major music festivals of the time were &quot;Primer Encuentro de Música de Vanguardia&quot; (January 1970), &quot;Primer Festival de Rock Progresivo&quot; (October 1971) and &quot;Los Caminos Que Se Abren&quot; (February 1973). All three happened at Quinta Vergara (Viña del Mar).

== Underground scene during the dictatorship (1973–1989) ==

The proliferation of Chilean rock bands in the early 1970s ended with the military coup of 11 September 1973. The repressive military regime prohibited all manifestations of rock music, along with many other forms of culture (see Military government of Chile (1973–1990): cultural life). This brought about a decline of the music industry in Chile and a deterioration of the Chilean rock scene. Some Latin American fusion bands broke up, like Los Blop&#x27;s, while others fled abroad, like Los Jaivas, who emigrated to Argentina. Others, like Congreso, were forced to radically change their music to a progressive rock style. By the late 1970s, an underground scene gradually began to emerge with punk rock, heavy metal, and later new wave music becoming increasingly popular.

=== Los Prisioneros ===
However, one of the most well-known and influential bands since the 1980s, and from all history of Chilean rock, was Los Prisioneros, who were especially known for their outspoken songwriter and lead vocalist, Jorge González. The trio was also conformed by Claudio Narea on guitar and second voices, and Miguel Tapia on drums. Musically ranged from rockabilly, to reggae, ska, punk and later synth pop. Jorge Leiva of Musica Popular describes Los Prisioneros as &quot;by far the most representative Chilean rock group. Their stripped-down rock, free from virtuoso pretensions, and their lyrics, full of acute social observation, were the voice of youth disenchantment during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.&quot; Their albums &quot;La voz de los &#x27;80, Pateando piedras&quot; and &quot;Corazones&quot; are considered among the best of Chilean popular musical history. On 1 October 1993 MTV&#x27;s Latin Channel (MTV Latino) debuted and they chose as their first video broadcast the Los Prisioneros music video &quot;We are sudamerican rockers&quot;.

===Punk and Hardcore===

Chile&#x27;s first contribution to punk rock can be found abroad. In the mid-1970s Alvaro Peña, better known as &quot;The Chilean with the Singing Nose&quot;, joined Joe Strummer in the band The 101&#x27;ers, one of the world&#x27;s first punk bands and a precursor to the legendary band The Clash.
From 1985, the first local punk bands began to play in union headquarters around Santiago, such as El Trolley, named after the trolleybus workers’ union, and a cab-drivers’ union in El Aguilucho in Ñuñoa, Santiago. These saw performances from punk bands the Pinochet Boys, Zapatilla Rota, and Dadá, among others. The first Chilean punk festival took place in El Garage Internacional de Matucana with Fiskales Ad-Hok, Ocho Bolas, Politikos Muertos and Vandalik among others. Jordi Berenguer writes: “they were clandestine and illegal spaces. It was the last years of the dictatorship. If there was now less to fear, the death and repression still continued.”
In the following years, stand out punk bands would include Los Peores de Chile, Bbs Paranoicos, Los Miserables, Machuca, Parkinson and post punk band Pánico. The hardcore punk bands would be Los Morton, Anarkía, Caos, Los KK, Belial and DTH. Pop punk bands of the late 1990s were Tronic, Gufi, or Los Mox!. Pegotes and Familea Miranda were able to take back punk to his original ideology. Horror punk was made by Letifer, Don Zata, Q.E.P.D or Voodoo Zombie.

===Heavy and Thrash Metal===
In the later 1970s and 1980s, a heavy metal scene developed that was highly clandestine despite having no overt political affiliation or outward opposition to General Augusto Pinochet and his ongoing military regime. Bands of this generation included Pentagram Chile, Dorso, Massakre, Necrosis, Panzer and Rust. Tom Araya would become the biggest metal figure as the lead vocalist and bassist of Slayer, after his family emigrated to the United States. 
During the late 1980s, with the dictatorship coming to an end, bands such as Squad, Massakre, Necrosis, Pentagram Chile and Criminal become well known in Chile and even at an international level. In contrast to punk, thrash metal had its origin in Santiago&#x27;s upper-class neighborhoods and was less involved with politics, although the lyrics of bands like Necrosis showed an interest in the political situation. Many other bands would leave his trail such as Turbo, Callejón Oscuro, Arrecife, Ekkos, Panchorrata in addition to other thrash metal bands such as SQVAD, SxNxFx (Sex No Future), Cancerbero, Atomic Aggressor Vastator and Bloody Cross, a black metal band formed in 1986.

At the turn of the decade, and as the dictatorship came to an end, more Chilean metal bands emerged, including Six Magics, Slavery, Torturer, Bismarck, Dracma and Inquisición. Progressive metal bands such as Alejandro Silva power cuarteto, Coprofago, Crisálida, Horeja, Matraz or Delta, were also notable. Tumulto, Arena Movediza and Millantún were between heavy metal and hard rock styles. The heyday of the Nu metal genre also expanded to Chile, generating a much more aggressive, raw and less commercial variant that was locally known as &quot;Aggro Metal&quot;. Since the beginning of the new millennium several bands, like 2X, Rekiem and Rey Chocolate, got considerable airplay on MTV and also participated in annual festivals until the mid 2000s, when Aggro Metal started to lose its past relevance and most of the bands split up or migrated to other styles.

A study made in 2018 confirms that Chile is the country with most metal bands per capita in Latin America doubling Argentina and the rest by far.

=== New Wave and Post Punk ===
Others groups of this decade were heavily influenced by electronic music, new wave music, as well as Argentine rock and pop. Acts such as Aparato Raro, Upa!, Banda 69, Emociones Clandestinas and Electrodomésticos in addition to the last stages of Los Prisioneros, were pioneers of indie and synth pop of modern days, and earned a significant amount of success.

=== Fusion and Progressive ===
Heirs of the Fusion latinoamericana of the early &#x27;70s, under the Pinochet regime new bands emerged that emphasized influences other than folk, such as contemporary classical music, jazz, metal, world music, or experimental music, away from the massive public but acclaimed by the circuits of connoisseurs, despite often struggling to record. Congreso and Los Jaivas would continue to lead the way in the next decades however many creatives progressive and fusion rock ensembles would rise such as Almandina, Kalish and Grace of King in the mid &#x27;70s. The jazz vibraphonist and classical conductor Guillermo Rifo was the founder of three important bands, Aquila, where he melds latin rhythms with electric ensemble, later form the Sexteto Hindemith 76, where he merged jazz, academic music and folk, and Latinomusicaviva where chamber music, jazz improvisation and rhythm merge of rock. Other bands were Santa y su gente, Miel, the first to use a synthesizer, and Kámara. Formed in 1972, Fusión is historically considered the first Chilean jazz-rock project, using electric instrumentation, experimented on rhythmic patterns of soul, funk and rock, but maintaining intact the impulse of the primitive jazz improvisation. Shortly after, Pizarro (founder of Fusión) released as soloist and later he would found in Europe, Tamarugo and Skuas, with influences of classical music, jazz and latin. In the &#x27;80s other significant bands were Tercera Generación, Quilín, Evolución, La Banda del Gnomo, Bandhada, Amapola, Ernesto Holman (previously bassist in Congreso), Ensamble, La Hebra, Cometa, AlSur and Huara. A singular case of underground resistance was Fulano, inspired in the Rock in Opposition movement, had a virtuoso Zappa-like jazz-rock style, with a punk attitude and witty lyrics, that would influence on modern avant-garde rock bands such as Akinetón Retard and Mediabanda. Once back in democracy new outstanding bands were formed such as La Marraqueta, Tryo, Matraz, Ergosum, Entrama, Akinetón Retard, Exsimio, Dwalin, Entrance, La Neura, Mediabanda (with their remarkable debut album in 2003 entitled &quot;Entre la Inseguridad y el Ego&quot;), Subterra, Mar de Robles, Primavera Negra, Astralis, Nubosidad Parcial and Fractal.

== Diversification and Internationalization (1990–2004) ==

In the 1990s, Chilean rock was characterized by a diversification of styles derived from rock and pop, as well as a greater exposure to the international market. This was due in part to the return of democracy and an end to the repression of cultural activities, as well as an increase in contact between the Chilean population and the rest of the world as a result of economic liberalization.
Thus, Alternative rock and Pop rock were the most common styles, among an increasingly wider range of subgenres.

=== Los Tres ===
The leading Chilean rock band of the 1990s were Los Tres, who mixed styles like rock (from rockabilly to grunge), jazz and cueca (Chile&#x27;s folkloric national dance) and became particularly successful in Mexico, The albums &quot;Los Tres&quot; (1991), &quot;La Espada &amp; la Pared&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fome&quot; (1997) are considered among the most influential albums of rock en español according to Rolling Stone Magazine and Culto Magazine from La Tercera. Besides an MTV Unplugged in (1995) which was one of the most laureate unplugged of the MTV Latino era. They became the iconic rock band of the Chilean transition to democracy.
The band took musical quality to a new level in Chile with its instrumental development of rock, thanks in part to versatile guitarist Ángel Parra, grandson of Violeta Parra, and leader of his own latin jazz band called Ángel Parra Trío. Álvaro Henríquez, lead singer and second guitarist, was previously known as the musician of La negra Ester, a very influential musical theater play (based on the poetry book written in décimas by Roberto Parra Sandoval and directed by Andrés Pérez). He also led Los Pettinellis, during Los Tres hiatus, who had a short but successful career from 2001 to 2004 before splitting up, not long after also performing in the Viña del Mar International Song Festival. In addition to a homonymous solo album in 2005. The rest of the band was composed by bassist Roberto Lindl and drummer Francisco Molina, who left the band in 2000 to start a jazz career in the United States after his experience in Chile with Los Titulares. Henríquez would become the third major rock star of Chile, after Gato Alquinta from Los Jaivas, and Jorge González from Los Prisioneros, due to his outstanding career with Los Tres.

===Pop Rock===

La Ley (Spanish for &quot;The Law&quot;), also had a very successful career in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries and won a Grammy Award, two Latin Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. After a failed first album, &quot;Desiertos&quot; (1990), they released &quot;Doble Opuesto&quot; (1991), which appears as the official first album of the band. Singles like &quot;Desiertos,&quot; &quot;Tejedores de Ilusión,&quot; and &quot;Prisioneros de la Piel&quot; made them stars in Chile, Argentina and Mexico, especially after the release of &quot;La Ley&quot;, their second recording (1993). After Andrés Bobe&#x27;s death in 1994 (guitars, vocals), La Ley continued with a new guitarist, Pedro Frugone, and released two more albums; in 1995, the band released &quot;Invisible&quot;, the album was their international breakout record and provided to the band their best-selling studio album to date, it included the number ones &quot;Dia Cero&quot; and &quot;El Duelo&quot;.

Other key 1990s bands included: Lucybell, whose popularity expanded during the decade throughout Chile and the rest of the continent, and more closely related to alternative rock. Javiera y Los Imposibles, whose lead singer Javiera Parra is also member of the Parra family, and Nicole who became the first female rock pop solo artist to gain international recognition, were also very popular. 
During the first half of the 2000s, Javiera y Los Imposibles, whose 2001 album &quot;AM&quot; was performed at the prestigious Viña del Mar International Song Festival in 2002, became widely popular. Saiko also formed in the late 1990s (1999) and, made up of former members of La Ley and the singer Denisse Malebrán, found recognition during the first half of the 2000s. La Rue Morgue would be a good example of jazzy pop rock music with good mainstream acceptance. Sexual Democracia was a regional band from Valdivia that reached popularity in Santiago. Other alternative pop rock bands were Elso Tumbay, Golem, Ludwig Band and Profetas y Frenéticos from Claudio Narea. Aleste and Sol Azul were the iconics one-hit wonder of 1990s pop.
Teen pop was led by Supernova and Stereo 3, and in the 2000s by emo pop band Kudai.

===Funk and Soul===

Even though the history of funk in Chile goes back to the late 1960s and Los Minimás, it was not until the 1990s that funk became widely popular. The first band to create a purely funk album in Chile was Los Morton, who formed in 1990 and released their debut album, &quot;Santo Remedio&quot;, in 1993. Their funk sometimes incorporated other styles such as rap and Hardcore, with other bands like Supersordo sharing this kind of sound. In 1995 Los Tetas, released their debut album entitled &quot;Mama Funk&quot;, combining rock, funk, soul and hip hop. Los Tetas’ first single, &quot;Corazón de Sandía&quot; (Watermelon Heart), was a summer hit on the local radio stations and their first two albums &quot;Mama Funk&quot; (1995) and &quot;La Medicina&quot; (1998), went on to be released and performed in several other Latin American countries. Between these two major works, they collaborated in the 1997 album of Tiro de Gracia &quot;Ser humano!!&quot; (&quot;Human being&quot;), which is considered the sixth best album in the history of Chile according to Rolling Stone Magazine.
In 1995, the successful band Chancho en Piedra emerged with their debut album &quot;Peor es mascar lauchas&quot; (It&#x27;s Worse To Chew Mice). Their style has been compared to the Red Hot Chili Peppers but they are also known for their unique funk/rock sound, goofy style, and their socially and politically aware lyrics. Their success continued with &quot;Ríndanse terrícolas&quot; (Surrender earthlings) (1998) and &quot;Marca Chancho&quot; (Pig brand) (2000). As of 2020, they have released 11 albums. Other funk bands emerging in this decade included Papanegro, Matahari, Raiza, Mamma Soul, Solo di Medina, or Cholomandinga in a mix of Latin rhythms and funk. La Pozze Latina, Makiza, De Kiruza, and Tiro de Gracia, made the rap funk scene, in the Chilean hip hop boom of the late 1990s. The electronic scene was led by DJ Raff and DJ Bitman. After the Los Tetas&#x27; hiatus in 2004, his members would have solo projects. C-Funk made a solo career in the United States and joined Chancho en Piedra as a guitarist in 2019. Tea-Time would found Funk Attack together with Rulo (who also founded Esencia) and both would have a solo career as well before they all reunited in 2011.

===Grunge===
As in the rest of the world, the grunge bands of Seattle had a great impact on Chilean youth in the beginning of the 1990s, and the decade saw the emergence of Chilean grunge bands like Jusolis, Mandrácula, Los Ex, Blu Toi and Duna. These last two produced their first albums independently, though Blu Toi&#x27;s album was distributed by Warner Bros. 
The influence of the grunge sound can also be seen in bands like Los Tres, Yajaira and Weichafe.

===Reggae===

One of the first bands to play reggae in Chile, despite reggae not being their main influence, was Sol y Lluvia, founded in 1976 and still active today. Sol y Lluvia also had strong ties to the Nueva Canción Chilena and later to alternative rock. Los prisioneros were also pioneers in reggae and ska during the 1980s. However Gondwana, founded in 1987, are today considered the most successful Chilean reggae band. Produced by the well-known Doctor Dread of RAS Records, Gondwana found success in Chile and abroad and performed in both Jamaica and the United States as well as his lead singer Quique Neira since he began his solo career in 2003. Another exponent of Chilean reggae in the 1990s was La Floripondio, who mixed reggae with cumbia, ska, and rock, similar to Joe Vasconcellos.

=== Chilean &quot;Brit&quot; Pop ===
In the second half of the 1990s a new wave of Chilean bands appeared, influenced mainly by the alternative rock and Britpop scenes that spread around the world. These included bands like Glup! who were heavily influenced by Blur, and reached great deal of mainstream success thanks to their hit single &quot;Freebola&quot; of the album &quot;1999&quot; released the same year. Other importants bands were Canal Magdalena, Solar, and Santos Dumont, all of whom became popular with Chilean Britpop fans.

=== Latin Rock ===

A prominent and special case was Joe Vasconcellos, who had worked as lead singer in Congreso between 1980 and 1984. Since the late 1980s, he developed a solo career that in the 1990s reached his peak. His style combines rock, blues, cumbia, Brazilian music, and other Latin rhythms, often with big percussion and brass sections. His albums &quot;Toque&quot; (1995), and &quot;Vivo&quot; (1999) were major hits, and would influence on next generations of Latin percussion-based rock artists, such as Chico Trujillo and the New Chilean cumbia movement.
Other bands in this kind of fusion would be Santo Barrio, Cholomandinga, and La Floripondio.

=== Blues Rock ===
The origins of blues in Chile are uncertain, although Aguaturbia was a benchmark in this style, as were Los Jaivas in their songs such as &quot;Canción del gancho&quot;, there is no more concrete background. The song &quot;O&#x27;Riley&quot; by Destruction Mac&#x27;s can be taken as a reference, which applies a harmonica with bluish touches, although the music of this band is clearly inspired by groups of hard rock like Mountain. Although there was a small revival in the 1980s with Mauricio Redolés, it was not until the 1990s that groups such as El Cruce and La Banda del Capitán Corneta that a blues of Creole dyes spread in Chile, the first two decades of the 21st century stood out Perrosky, Julius Popper, Zapatillas Social Blues, La Rompehueso and La Rata Bluesera.

== Digital era, commercial decline and future (2005–present) ==


These years have seen a consolidation of the previous successes of Chilean rock-pop in the international market, while the older artists are now considered cultural icons. During the 2010s, rock music in general saw a decline in mainstream popularity and chilean rock was not a exception, however a new generation of musicians began to appear, mostly independent and difficult to classify due to the increasing fusion of sub-genres. Folk rock and synth pop are genres that have been successfully reinvented, while an ever-present hard rock scene continues among fan niches.

In the second half of the 2000s, one of the best-known Chilean rock bands was Los Bunkers, an alternative rock group from Concepción, Chile, who formed in 1999. With their contemporary rock sound, influenced by 1960s rock and folk sounds, the band has achieved international success with the album &quot;Vida de perros&quot; (Dog&#x27;s Life) and performed at the Vive Latino festival in Mexico City in 2006 and 2007. Also from Concepción are the band De Saloon, forming in 2003. Other notable band of this period included Sinergia, with a mix of nu metal and Comedy rock with humorous lyrics of daily and mundane Chilean topics, winning fans outside the rock scene.

=== Emergence of indie, acoustic, synthpop and rock-pop ===
Several Chilean artists – including Anita Tijoux (previously known as lead singer in hip hop band Makiza), Mon Laferte, Francisca Valenzuela, Álex Anwandter, Gepe, Javiera Mena, Pedropiedra, Camila Gallardo, Denise Rosenthal, María Colores, Teleradio Donoso, Ases Falsos, Planeta No, Astro, Primavera de Praga, Difuntos Correa, Niños del Cerro, and Dënver, among others – gain international praise and recognition, especially in the Spanish press, with El País calling Chile a &quot;new pop paradise&quot;.
Alongside with the electronic aesthetics, a new generation of mostly acoustic singer-songwriters, and world music inspired musicians had an important presence in stages and media. Manuel García (previously known as leader of Mecánica Popular), Nano Stern, Chinoy, Camila Moreno, Pascuala Ilabaca, Fernando Milagros, Paz Court, Evelyn Cornejo, Paz Quintana, Natalia Contesse are some of them.

=== Hard Rock highlights ===
Among the most celebrated new rock bands of the 2010s decade were Kuervos del Sur, Rama, Tenemos Explosivos, Alectrofobia, Matorral, Cómo asesinar a Felipes (fusing alternative hip hop and jazz with rock) Weichafe, Adelaida, Angelo Pierattini and Cler Canifrú. Kuervos del Sur are considered heirs of Los Jaivas in making rock with latinamerican instruments and rhythms, but with a harder sound, close to post-grunge. They won a &quot;Pulsar Award&quot; for best rock album in 2017 for &quot;El Vuelo del Pillán&quot;.

=== Festivals ===

In the 2010 &quot;Festival El Abrazo&quot; (The Hug Festival), held in Santiago to celebrate 200 years of independence for both Chile and Argentina, Chilean heavyweights Los Jaivas and Los Tres were joined by Argentinean artists like Charly García and Fito Páez, among others. Meanwhile, Los Bunkers were, in 2011, the first Chilean band to play Coachella in the United States.
In April 2011, Chile hosted Lollapalooza Chile, the first of the Lollapalooza festivals to be held outside the United States. Its success was such that it returned again from 2012 to 2019 and attracted international artists like The Killers, Kanye West, Foo Fighters, Arctic Monkeys and hundreds of other big names. Chilean acts like Los Bunkers, Chico Trujillo and Anita Tijoux have also performed at the Chicago version of Lollapalooza.
Another big festival was &quot;La Cumbre del Rock Chileno&quot; (The heights of Chilean rock) being held in 2007, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2017 and 2018. Hundreds of Chilean bands performed, included major artist as well as emerging ones.

In 2012 and 2013, a festival called Metal Fest featured local metal bands with international artists such as Anthrax, The Misfits and Blind Guardian.

Other festivals are &quot;Rock en Conce&quot; (Also known as REC), held since 2015 in Concepción, &quot;Rockódromo&quot; and &quot;Rock Carnaza&quot; in Valparaíso, &quot;Fluvial&quot; in Valdivia, &quot;Woodstaco&quot; in Maule Region and &quot;Chiloé Metal Fest&quot; in Chiloé Archipelago.

<text>Harris Teeter Supermarkets, LLC., also known as Harris Teeter Neighborhood Food &amp; Pharmacy, is an American supermarket chain based in Matthews, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte. , the chain operates 262 stores in seven states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Delaware, Maryland) and Washington, D.C. &quot;Supermarket News&quot; ranked Harris Teeter No. 34 in the 2012 &quot;Top 75 Retailers &amp; Wholesalers&quot; based on 2011 fiscal year sales of $4.3 billion.

On July 9, 2013, Harris Teeter Supermarkets announced that it was being acquired by The Kroger Company for $2.5 billion. The sale closed on January 28, 2014, though the company retained its name, brand, and headquarters in Matthews. On February 1, 2022, Harris Teeter named Tammy DeBoer as the company&#x27;s president.

==History==

===Founding and early days===

Harris Teeter was founded by William Thomas Harris and Willis L. Teeter, two entrepreneurs who started their separate businesses during the Great Depression in Charlotte, North Carolina. Harris opened a full-service drugstore called Harris Drugs and Teeter opened Teeters Food Mart, later merging their two ventures.

Harris, an employee of the A&amp;P store on Central and Pecan Avenues – Charlotte&#x27;s first supermarket – borrowed funds in 1936 to open the Harris Super Market at 1704 Central Avenue. The store had eight employees, primarily selling dry groceries because frozen foods and refrigeration did not become common until World War II. To the family and their employees, it was known as Store #1. This store, later known as Harris Teeter store #201, closed on June 5, 2012, and was replaced by the two-story store #401 on the same site, which opened on May 29, 2013.

Harris&#x27; store was the first in North Carolina to allow customers to select their own groceries off the shelves. Before this time, customers handed a shopping list to a clerk, who then selected the groceries for the customers. The store was also open until 9 p.m. on Fridays, at a time when most grocery stores closed their doors at 5 p.m. This was done to appeal to working families and to capture their grocery shopping after they were paid on Fridays. Later, the Harris Super Market was the first grocery store in Charlotte to add air conditioning.

Harris also ran his own dairy farm and sold products from his dairy in his stores. For his wife, LaVerne, the dairy products carried the brand name of Vernedale Farms. Harris pioneered the first dairy co‑op among local dairy farmers. After running the co-op for several years, he negotiated its sale to Pet Dairy.

Harris Super Markets began primarily as a family business. Most of Harris&#x27;s brothers and sisters were employees, and brothers and brothers-in-law were store managers. His sister, Sarah, ran the accounting department and his wife&#x27;s sister was Harris&#x27;s personal secretary. His son, Donald Thomas Harris, began working for the company at eight years old by sweeping floors. As an adult, Donald suggested that Harris Teeter should carry more than just food products, and recommended the introduction of health and beauty aids, school supplies, bakeware, kitchen tools, and seasonal items (such as coolers in the summer). His father liked the idea and told Don that he should create and run that division of the company, which he did until his retirement in 1995. He was the last member of the family who worked for the company.

Harris was instrumental in the permanent placement of kindergartens in the South Carolina public school system, and supported the effort to turn Charleston College into what is known today as the College of Charleston.

In 1939, Willis L. Teeter, who also worked for A&amp;P at its Mooresville, North Carolina store, with his brother Paul, who was also working for A&amp;P, borrowed $1,700 to open Teeter&#x27;s Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville. A&amp;P was closing its doors in Mooresville and agreed to lease the location to the Teeter brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter&#x27;s was a family-run operation. Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager, and Teeter&#x27;s wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul&#x27;s wife, Mildred, later joined the staff as a bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their standards of providing great customer service and only the best products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would do on the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would have them treat you.

In 1946, the Teeters moved from downtown to a larger location to keep up with demand. The Teeters were leaders in installing the first automated doors and check-outs in North Carolina. In July 1953, the Teeters opened their second store in Lincolnton, North Carolina. At this point the Teeters had become a household name. Lines of eager shoppers wrapped around the new store in anticipation of being one of the first customers in Teeters&#x27; second location. The Teeters&#x27; success continued to grow and by 1957 their third store opened in Newton, North Carolina, a fourth in Cornelius, a fifth in Hickory, and a sixth opened in Morganton, North Carolina, in November 1958.

After opening his sixth store Teeter joined the NC Food Dealers Association. At one of the Food Dealers meetings, Teeter met Harris. The two men decided that working together would increase the financial strength of the two supermarkets, allow them to grow more rapidly, and decrease operating costs. W. L. Teeter and W. T. Harris agreed to merge and did so in November 1959 to become Harris Teeter Supermarkets. The merger of 15 stores collectively became official in February 1960. The new company became the largest independent grocery organization in the Carolinas.

===New ownership and 1980s expansion===
Harris Teeter was purchased in 1969 by The Ruddick Corporation, owned and run by the Bourgeois-Dickson Family. The new owners introduced alcoholic beverages for sale for the first time. Harris, a devout Southern Baptist, had refused to allow the sale of alcohol, even after the merger.

In 1970, the chain introduced the Big M discount concept to compete with Colonial Stores Big Star discount chain and A&amp;P&#x27;s &quot;WEO&quot;. Those stores were mainly in working-class neighborhoods, while middle and upper-class areas retained Harris Teeter. By 1976, the chain merged the two back to Harris Teeter/More Value and finally to just Harris Teeter again in 1979.

Harris Teeter&#x27;s 1980 acquisition of the Hunter Farms dairy in High Point, North Carolina, enabled the company to substantially reduce dairy costs. Today, all Harris Teeter-brand and Hunter Farms-brand dairy products come from the Hunter dairy. Hunter also provides dairy products to companies and organizations not associated with Harris Teeter, including convenience stores, schools, Lowes Foods private label ice creams, and the Wendy&#x27;s Frosty.

In 1984, Harris Teeter purchased several Food World stores in and around Greensboro. As part of the purchase, the company acquired a warehouse in the western part of Greensboro. This marked the first significant foray of the company outside its Charlotte base. Before this point, the company was a grocer in the vein of Piggly Wiggly, with a mix of stores in urban and rural areas. Since 1984, Harris Teeter has focused more on higher-income urban sites. This trend continued with HT&#x27;s 1988 purchase of Big Star Supermarkets, giving it a foothold in the Raleigh-Durham market.

Ashcraft retired in 1986, and Edward Dunn took over as president of Harris Teeter in that year. During Dunn&#x27;s watch, Harris Teeter began expansion outside North Carolina. The first expanded stores were in the northern part of South Carolina, near Charlotte. Later expansions led the company to Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. The &quot;Very Important Customer&quot; program, popularly known as VIC, was introduced later in Dunn&#x27;s tenure. This program was one of the first widespread loyalty card programs now popular throughout American grocery stores. The VIC program advertised &quot;giveaways&quot; such as turkeys for Thanksgiving, beach apparel for the summer, and gift cards to Harris Teeter stores.

In 1981, Harris Teeter was one of the first grocery chains to test plastic grocery bags. In 1985 the company added child-restraint belts to shopping carts. The chain&#x27;s flagship store during the 1980s was in Charlotte&#x27;s Cotswold neighborhood. It featured a waterfall and a fresh orange juice machine in the produce department, and for a brief period stocked fresh truffles that were flown in from France and priced at $300 a pound.
===1990s and 2000s: further expansion===

Fred Morganthall became president of Harris Teeter upon Dunn&#x27;s retirement in 1997. Morganthall oversaw further expansion of the supermarket chain since taking over as company president. His first initial expansions moved Harris Teeter into Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta, Georgia; and Jacksonville, Florida, which happened through the end of the 1990s.

Harris Teeter&#x27;s expansion into Atlanta included 15 stores around the city and its suburbs. There were plans to further expand in Atlanta. However, these plans were only partially fulfilled and poorly executed, leading the chain to pull out of the Atlanta market altogether in 2001. Atlanta already had an established supermarket base with Publix and Kroger. Kroger quickly bought and reopened some of the former Atlanta Harris Teeter store spaces as Kroger stores, although remodeling these stores to Kroger&#x27;s store floor plan and design took a few years.

Harris Teeter originally operated three stores in the greater Jacksonville area when the company expanded into that market in the late 1990s. However, only one store remains open serving Amelia Island/Fernandina Beach, and thus making it Harris Teeter&#x27;s only Florida location, albeit just south of the Georgia border. The Mandarin area store closed in 2004. October 3, 2006, brought the closing of the Ponte Vedra Beach location.

Starting in the 2000s, Harris Teeter attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors by providing exceptional customer service and newly &quot;branded&quot; departments. The first department to be &quot;branded&quot; was the meat department, which in June 2002 began offering &quot;Harris Teeter Rancher&quot; beef. This was followed by the introductions of the Farmers&#x27; Market (produce department, October 2003), the Fisherman&#x27;s Market (seafood department, April 2004), and the Fresh Foods Market (deli/bakery, January 2005). Gourmet imported items are sold under the &quot;H.T. Traders&quot; brand.

Harris Teeter stores are now separated into 3 regions and 20 districts. The Northern Region, based in Fairfax, Virginia, encompasses all stores in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the northern coastal area of North Carolina. The Central Region, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, encompasses stores from Greensboro/High Point to Wilmington and Albemarle. The Southern Region, based in Charlotte, contains stores in southwestern North Carolina (from Winston-Salem to Asheville), as well as South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.
, Harris Teeter had over 18,000 employees, and is the second largest supermarket chain in North Carolina, with Food Lion being number one.

By the mid to late 2000s, expansion to the Outer Banks of North Carolina had begun with stores in Corolla (May 2006), Kill Devil Hills (July 2006), and Morehead City (February 2009). The first store in Maryland opened in Darnestown on October 31, 2006; the second opened in May 2008 in Columbia&#x27;s Village of Kings Contrivance, replacing the closed Safeway. The first store in Washington, D.C., opened in 2008.

Harris Teeter continues its shift into high-income urban areas. Most new stores opened in Morganthall&#x27;s tenure conform to this pattern. Stores such as the original Harris Super Market, located near uptown Charlotte, remain grandfathered into the current system. With Harris Teeter&#x27;s further expansion into the upscale markets, many of their older stores in lower income neighborhoods or small towns were being shut down as a result. One of Harris Teeter&#x27;s oldest stores at Eastland Mall in Charlotte closed on June 22, 2006.

===2010 to today===

The chain&#x27;s expansion into Baltimore&#x27;s Locust Point neighborhood was originally set for 2010, but was delayed due to &quot;construction and financial problems&quot;. As of April 2014, Harris Teeter had eleven stores in Maryland, including the Locust Point location.

After selling its only other holding, American and Efird, Inc., Ruddick changed its name to Harris Teeter Supermarkets, Inc. in 2012. It had consolidated revenues of $4.3 billion for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2011 (&quot;Fiscal 2011&quot;).

In June 2012, Harris Teeter announced the closure of six locations outside the Charlotte core, and its purchase of ten Lowes Foods stores in the Charlotte region. In turn, Lowes Foods would take the six Harris Teeter locations that would close and be compensated $26.5 million. Harris Teeter said this decision was based on focusing on larger, urbanized, and more upscale areas rather than rural, middle-market areas. In turn, Lowes Foods planned to shift to the western part of North Carolina, and away from Charlotte. However, industry analysts speculate that these changes are happening due to the impending expansion of Publix into the Charlotte market.

In 2012, Harris Teeter closed its stores in Asheville, Hickory, Shelby, Morganton, and two stores in Gastonia; the company had been established in these markets for at least the last half-century. The company returned to Asheville in 2013 with store #348 and Gastonia in 2016 with store #281. The newer Harris Teeter in Hendersonville, as well as the Boone location, did not close. They were retained as the only Harris Teeter stores in the western part of the Charlotte market. The Lowes Foods stores that became Harris Teeter were three stores in Charlotte, now two with the Hunter&#x27;s Crossing store closing in 2018 (the Promenade store became a Fresh Market), and one in Cornelius, Davidson, Huntersville, Matthews (Stallings), Wesley Chapel, and Fort Mill, South Carolina. Lowes Foods stores in Harrisburg and Mooresville were retained.

The chain&#x27;s largest store opened in winter 2018 at the New Bern Marketplace in New Bern, North Carolina, totaling up to 100,000 square feet. Harris Teeter also operates a number of prototype stores in their seven state layout. Some of these include a 78,200 square foot location in Greensboro, North Carolina, and a 78,000 square foot location in Charlotte.

A new upscale grocery store called 201central and owned by Harris Teeter opened two locations in two former Lowes Foods locations in Huntersville, North Carolina and Wesley Chapel, North Carolina, but the Huntersville store closed on February 3, 2018, with the Wesley Chapel store following on December 15, 2020. This announcement came shortly after upscale brand Whole Foods Market opened its first Charlotte store in late summer 2012 and before Publix announced its expansion into the Charlotte region.

In recent years, Harris Teeter has started a &quot;Fuel Points&quot; program whereby customers can earn discounts that can be used on gasoline purchases at Harris Teeter Fuel stations, which are adjacent to some Harris Teeter locations.

Since 1992, the official mascot of Harris Teeter has been &quot;Harry the Happy Dragon.&quot; Its slogan is &quot;Your Neighborhood Food Market&quot;, although the older slogan &quot;The Best Is What We&#x27;re All About&quot; still appears frequently in stores. An advertising campaign that debuted in 2004 features the slogan &quot;My Harris Teeter&quot;, which is used as a jingle.

===Kroger merger===
It was announced on July 9, 2013, that Kroger would buy Harris Teeter for $2.4 billion in cash. The company became a subsidiary of Kroger and continued to operate under the Harris Teeter brand. The merger closed on January 29, 2014, upon which chairman Thomas Dickson announced his retirement. The deal represented a return of sorts to the Charlotte market for Kroger. It had previously operated stores under its own moniker in Charlotte from 1977 to 1988. It also allowed Kroger to enter the Asheville region. Charlotte and Asheville had been the only large markets in the Carolinas where Kroger had no presence.

In June 2015, Harris Teeter exited the crowded Nashville market, where its growth was stunted by aggressive competition from Publix (which expanded into the area around the same time as Harris Teeter), as well as other specialty grocers such as Trader Joe&#x27;s, The Fresh Market, and Whole Foods, which all opened stores in the proximity of Harris Teeter locations. Kroger has traditionally had a market-leading presence in Nashville, and initially promised to keep the Harris Teeter stores open after the acquisition, But later, Kroger said the market &quot;did not support Harris Teeter&#x27;s future business plans.&quot; Harris Teeter closed one Nashville-area store soon after opening in the early-2000s, but five survived into 2015. The first of those closed in February, another was permanently closed in June, and the remaining three were converted to Kroger stores by 2016 (one of which replaced a nearby existing Kroger store).

<doc id="1233491" wikidata="Q3437850" url="?curid=1233491" title="Rock music in Ireland">
<text>Rock music in Ireland, also known as Irish rock, has been a part of the music of Ireland since the 1960s, when the British Invasion brought British blues, psychedelic rock and other styles to the island. The Irish music scene in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was dominated by the unique Irish phenomenon of the &#x27;Showbands&#x27; which were groups of professional performers who played at dancehalls and clubs across the country. They were putting on a professional &#x27;show&#x27; and playing all the American and British hits of the era. From the mid-1970s onwards rock music in Ireland has followed a similar path to rock music in Britain.

==1960s==

In the 1960s being part of a &#x27;Showband&#x27; was essentially the only way a professional musician in Ireland could make a living. Van Morrison, Henry McCullough and Rory Gallagher started working in Irish showbands, but went on to put Ireland on the rock music map. Van Morrison, growing up on Hyndford Street, was inspired by fellow resident George Cassidy, a jazz musician. Cassidy taught Morrison how to play tenor saxophone and music notation lessons, which made them bond and become friends. Van Morrison achieved international success in the 1960s with the beat group Them before launching a very successful solo career. Rory Gallagher formed the blues rock trio Taste and went on to achieve critical acclaim in his solo career which lasted until his death in 1995. He is considered by many music critics to be among the greatest rock guitarists of all time. The Strangers from Balbriggan were also very popular and had a unique sound. Their record &quot;Strangers&quot; made # 6 in the Irish charts.

Eire Apparent, a rock band from Belfast who formed in 1967 is noted for launching the careers of Henry McCullough and Ernie Graham, and for having Jimi Hendrix play on, and produce, their only album.

==1970s==
The early 1970s saw a growth of Irish rock music. One band that rose to international prominence was the hard rocking Thin Lizzy, led by Phil Lynott. Another Irish band, Horslips, broke new ground by mixing hard rock with traditional Irish music to create a new genre – Celtic rock. They challenged the idea that an Irish band had to leave the country to be successful. They stayed in Ireland instead of moving abroad to chase success. They were successful in Ireland but never achieved much international success. The early 1970s paved the way for another band that would remain based in Ireland but would go on to dominate the music world – U2. U2 began their musical career in 1976 and went on to become internationally known. Irish success in this period on a more commercial basis was led by Waterford born pop singer/songwriter Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, whose achievements included two UK No. 1 singles (&quot;Clair&quot; and &quot;Get Down&quot;) and one United States No. 1 (&quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;)

In the mid-70s, with a roots revival of traditional music burgeoning, folk rock fusion groups such as Planxty and Moving Hearts as well as singer-songwriters like Christy Moore and Paul Brady rose to prominence.

The late 1970s saw the height of the punk rock movement. Irish bands such as Northern Ireland&#x27;s Stiff Little Fingers and The Undertones as well as Dublin&#x27;s The Radiators from Space, The Boomtown Rats, Berlin, The Blades, The Vipers and the avant-garde The Virgin Prunes were in the midst of the new genre.

==1980s==
The 1980s saw the rise to stardom of the most successful Irish rock band, U2. Since the release of their album &quot;Boy&quot; in 1980, U2 has grown to become one of the biggest rock bands in the world. In fact, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; claims this band to be &quot;the biggest band in the world.&quot; Band members Bono (Paul Hewson), The Edge (David Evans), Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr have brought international attention to this unique genre. Within four years of starting the band, they were signed onto Island Records. Their 1987 album, &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; sent them over the top. Now, in the third decade of their career, they continue to achieve enormous commercial and critical success. Throughout their career U2 have kept their base firmly planted in their home town, Dublin. The band, especially frontman Bono, are also well known for their social conscience and their involvement in various international causes. Along with the 1980s came County Donegal group Clannad who were, at the time, innovators in bridging the gap between pop rock music and traditional Irish music.

Following the disbandment of The Undertones in 1983, lead vocalist Feargal Sharkey pursued a solo career while the other band members formed That Petrol Emotion along with an American vocalist, Steve Mack.

In 1986 The Saw Doctors from Tuam in County Galway formed however the band would have to wait until the nineties and noughties for major success. Orchestral pop band The Divine Comedy from Enniskillen also formed in the eighties.

In the 1980s The Pogues became very successful with their radical new take on the fusion of traditional Irish music with punk rock attitude. This style of &#x27;punked-up traditional Irish music&#x27; has also taken off outside Ireland and the UK, especially in the United States. Other Irish artists to gain fame in the 1980s were Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and the heavy metal group Mama&#x27;s Boys. Former Thin Lizzy guitarist Gary Moore achieved success in his 1980s solo career but returned to his blues rock roots in the 1990s. The 1980s witnessed a lot of interest from foreign shores Cactus World News were one of the bands which managed to garner success outside Ireland (United States, UK Germany) without become hugely successful they charted continually internationally.

The 1980s also saw the birth of rock band Aslan from Finglas and Ballymun in North Dublin, the third biggest selling Irish act in Ireland.

In 1981 the Slane Concert at Slane Castle in County Meath began which is still held most years.

==1990s==

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Dublin based group My Bloody Valentine pioneered a new style of rock, Shoegazing, and received much critical acclaim. A new crop of Irish rockers claimed success in the 1990s including The Cranberries from Limerick, The Golden Horde, Indie rock bands Blink, The Frames and the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful Whipping Boy and The Revenants – all from Dublin, Alternative metal band from County Antrim &#x27;Therapy?&#x27;, folk rock group The Corrs of Dundalk and Alternative rock band Ash from Downpatrick, County Down.

From 1990 to 1997 the Féile Festival was an annual rock music festival held in Semple Stadium in Thurles, Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork, and the Point Theatre in Dublin.

At the very end of the decade The Undertones, a popular band in the 1970s and 1980s, reformed without vocalist Feargal Sharkey.

==2000s==

The 2000s have continued the theme in Ireland, revealing such great musical artists as singer/songwriter Damien Rice who has achieved international critical acclaim. Groups such as Snow Patrol, Nine Lies, The Thrills and The Script have also had significant international success. This decade has also produced a number of acclaimed solo singer/songwriters such as Paddy Casey, Duke Special, Damien Dempsey, Bressie, Declan O&#x27;Rourke, Chris Singleton, Cathy Davey, Gemma Hayes, David Kitt, Mundy, Jinx Lennon and Simple Kid.

Other bands from Ireland that formed in the 2000s include Nine Lies, The Coronas, The Blizzards, Royseven, Two Door Cinema Club, Hamsandwich, The Answer, Codes, The Chakras, Fred, Hybrasil, Heathers and Adebisi Shank.

There are many rock concerts and festivals annually in Ireland which began in the 2000s, and continue to run today. Most notably Oxegen, Electric Picnic, Indiependence and Belsonic.

==2010s==
In the late 2000s and 2010s many unsigned bands emerged from both north and south of the border, such as, Hozier, Fontaines D.C., Axis Of, Time Is a Thief, Jody Has A Hitlist, Girl Band, LaFaro, Fighting with Wire, RUN iN RED, Podracer, Dead Label!, Chewing on Tinfoil, Kasper Rosa, Black Svan, Words That Burn &amp; Two Glass Eyes, and the best of the bunch, Strangers With Guns.

<text>Taxicab Confessions is a television series of hidden camera documentaries that aired on HBO from 1995 through 2006.

When passengers enter the cab, they are recorded with several small cameras hidden in the taxi. The producer prompts passengers into discussing their past and/or present circumstances. This has led some participants to reflect on their life, recalling extreme tragedies or triumphs. Much is verbally or visually graphic, including explicit sex talk and sex acts performed in the back seat. At the end of the taxi ride, passengers are asked to sign waivers allowing the hidden camera footage to be used on the program, and footage of this revelation is sometimes seen during the closing credits.

Separating the segments are short video montages showing life in the city, incorporating quick cuts of club interiors, flashing neon signage, strippers and the homeless, along with the series theme music, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.

The series originated in New York, moved to Las Vegas, and then returned to New York.

==Awards and nominations==
The first episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series or Special in 1995. The show was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Program (Reality) in 2001 and 2002.

<text>The Third Coast International Audio Festival (TCIAF or TCF), based in Chicago, curates audio stories from around the world and showcases them in various mediums. It is informally referred to as the &quot;Sundance of Radio&quot;.

The festival was affiliated with Chicago Public Radio station WBEZ and features a weekly radio show and podcast, a national broadcast, occasional competitions and challenges, and public listening events. Speakers at TCIAF&#x27;s annual conference have included Jay Allison, Jad Abumrad, Joe Frank, Ira Glass, Robert Krulwich, the Kitchen Sisters, and Nancy Updike.

The term Third Coast refers to the idea that while the U.S. population tends to be concentrated near the east and west coasts, Chicago, lying on the shores of Lake Michigan, is the country&#x27;s third largest city.

The festival is associated with the &quot;Re:sound&quot; audio programs.

<doc id="1233494" wikidata="Q12407562" url="?curid=1233494" title="Henoch Leibowitz">
<text>Alter Chanoch Henoch Hakohen Leibowitz (June 2, 1918 – April 15, 2008) was an Orthodox rabbi who was Rosh Yeshiva (dean) of Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen, which was founded by his father Rabbi Chaim Dovid Hakohen Leibowitz in 1933.

==Biography==

Leibowitz was born in 1918 in Šalčininkai, Lithuania, and was the only son of Dovid Leibowitz. He came to America in 1926 when his father was hired by Mesivta Torah Vodaath as a teacher. In 1933, his father left Torah Vodaath and founded Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen. His father&#x27;s death in 1941 left him in charge of the yeshiva in his early 20s. He built a network of Jewish educational institutions in the United States, Canada and Israel.

David Paterson reportedly called Leibowitz “the most honest person in the state of New York”.

==Notable students==
His students include the following rabbis:
* Dovid Harris, &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; (dean) of Yeshiva Chafetz Chaim
* Akiva Grunblatt, &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of Yeshiva Chafetz Chaim
* Elyakim Rosenblatt, &quot;rebbi&quot; in Yeshiva Chafetz Chaim and later &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of Yeshiva Kesser Torah
* Menachem Davidowitz, &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of Talmudic Institute of Upstate New York
* Baruch Chait, &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of the Israeli high school Maarava Machon Rubin
* Mordechai Goldstein zt&quot;l, &quot;founder&quot; and &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot; of the Diaspora Yeshiva on Mount Zion, Jerusalem, and Chief Rabbi of Mount Zion and King David&#x27;s Tomb.

<text>The Haliburton Broadcasting Group was a Canadian group of FM radio stations, located primarily in smaller markets in Ontario. The company was purchased by Vista Broadcast Group in 2012.

==History==
The company was named for the Haliburton region in Central Ontario, where majority owner and president Christopher Grossman, a longtime radio sales manager, trainer and executive, was also a hotelier before purchasing his first radio station, CFBG in Bracebridge, in 1997.

HBG expanded greatly into Northern Ontario in 1999 by acquiring several stations from the Pelmorex Radio Network. In 2004, they also acquired CKNR in Elliot Lake, a station which had also once been part of Pelmorex but was sold to North Channel Broadcasting in 1996.

At its peak the company owned 24 English stations, mostly branded &quot;Moose FM&quot;. Some other stations such as CFBK-FM Huntsville use other brandings. They were generally formatted with adult contemporary or hot adult contemporary music; &quot;Moose FM&quot; Timmins was a country station before moving to adult hits. The company also formerly operated two French stations, branded as CHYC (pronounced like the French word &quot;chic&quot;), over a number of transmitters, but these were sold to Le5 Communications in 2008.

Haliburton&#x27;s head office was in Toronto, Ontario, although most of its operations were based in Haliburton. Toronto-based Slaight Communications owned a significant minority interest in the group, which was not included in that company&#x27;s 2007 sale of most of its broadcasting assets to Astral Media.

In 2006 and 2007, the company also expanded into Southwestern Ontario for the first time, launching a new station in Kincardine as a partial owner, and acquiring an existing station in Haldimand.

On May 20, 2010, Haliburton applied to the CRTC to acquire CJJM-FM in Espanola, which was owned by Joco Communications and received approval on August 12, 2010. Formerly branded as Joco Radio, the station was rebranded as Moose FM in September 2010. The company also announced subsequent deals to acquire CJJM&#x27;s former sister station CFSF-FM in Sturgeon Falls, as well as CJCS and CHGK-FM in Stratford; these transactions were approved by the CRTC on February 21, 2011.

In late 2010, the company applied to buy two Niagara Falls radio stations, CKEY-FM and CFLZ-FM. Haliburton received approval on June 8, 2011.

On April 23, 2012 Vista Broadcast Group, which owns 38 radio stations in western Canada, announced a deal to acquire Haliburton Broadcasting, in cooperation with Westerkirk Capital, for $32.34 million. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on October 19, 2012.

In 2021, Grossman began a new company, Local Radio Lab, acquiring several Ontario stations owned by My Broadcasting Corporation.

==Strategy and competition==
Haliburton&#x27;s strategy has been based on the conversion of former AM radio stations to FM, adoption of generally more contemporary-oriented music formats, modest staffing levels, and economies of scale through shared voice tracking, production and advertising sales across the regional group.

CHNO in Sudbury was an AM oldies station when Haliburton acquired it from Pelmorex; a stipulation in the CRTC&#x27;s approval of the transaction allowed it to move to FM. In 2000, it relaunched at 103.9 as a CHR/Top 40 station branded as &quot;Z103&quot;. After a short time, it was sold in 2001 to the larger Newcap Broadcasting for significantly more than it had been acquired for. The CRTC, wary of potential &quot;license trafficking,&quot; accepted the sale on the grounds that Haliburton had been losing money with CHNO, and would reinvest the proceeds into its contemporaneous purchase of CKLP in Parry Sound.

CHMT in Timmins launched in 2001 as an adult contemporary station as &quot;Mix 93&quot;, but soon faltered under competition from CKGB, formerly an AM country station which adopted the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; adult contemporary brand and moved to FM shortly after CHMT launched. CHMT flipped to country about a year later, and eventually relented as had CHNO, abandoning its own sales staff and sharing sales with the two Rogers Media stations in Timmins.

On March 17, 2005, the CRTC published notice of an application Haliburton filed in 2004 to launch an FM country station in North Bay, which was approved on August 11, 2005. However, the North Bay station launched as an adult hits format in the summer of 2006, instead of the country music format the station originally proposed.

On April 7, 2005, they published notice of an application also filed in 2004 to launch an FM &quot;adult contemporary rock&quot; station in Haliburton itself. This license was also subsequently granted, and the station launched in 2006.

On August 4, 2010, Haliburton applied to operate a new FM radio station in Barry&#x27;s Bay to operate at 106.5 MHz with an adult contemporary format. Haliburton received CRTC approval on January 12, 2011.

On December 13, 2010, Haliburton applied to operate a new FM radio station in Kemptville. The new station will operate on 97.5 MHz with an adult contemporary format. Haliburton received CRTC approval on April 21, 2011.

On May 19, 2011, Haliburton applied to operate a new FM radio station in Prescott. The new station would operate at 107.9 MHz with a hot adult contemporary format. Haliburton received CRTC approval on November 10, 2011.

On November 9, 2011, Haliburton submitted applications to the CRTC to acquire CJFB-FM in Bolton and CFGM-FM in Caledon. This was approved on March 14, 2012.

==Sale of holdings==
In May 2008, Haliburton announced a deal to sell the CHYC stations to Le5 Communications, a firm owned by Sudbury lawyer Paul Lefebvre, for a purchase price of $425,000. The deal was approved by the CRTC on October 31, 2008.

On July 28, 2008, HBG announced that it had sold 12 stations to Newcap Broadcasting, subject to CRTC approval, for a price of $18.95 million. The Kincardine and Haldimand stations were not part of the deal, and their status was not disclosed at the time of the Newcap announcement. Newcap&#x27;s formal application to acquire the stations was published for public hearings by the CRTC on November 13, 2008, but was subsequently withdrawn in January 2009. Newcap CEO Rob Steele indicated that in light of the credit market crisis, the company did not feel that it was the right time to increase its debt load.

In February 2009, Haliburton was part of a tentative deal to sell CIYN in Kincardine to My Broadcasting Corporation.

On October 19, 2012, the CRTC approved Vista Broadcast Group&#x27;s application for authority to acquire Haliburton&#x27;s AM and FM radio stations located in Ontario.

<text>David Lesley Schultz (June 6, 1959 – January 26, 1996) was an American Olympic and World champion freestyle wrestler, and a seven-time World and Olympic medalist. He coached individuals and teams at the college level and also privately.

Dave and his brother, wrestler Mark Schultz, both won gold at the same Olympics (1984). The Schultzes were one of three sets of brothers (the others are Buvaisar and Adam Saitiev, and Anatoli and Sergei Beloglazov) to win both World and Olympic championships. The Schultz brothers have won more NCAA, World, and Olympic titles than any other American brother combination in history.

Schultz was employed as a coach by John du Pont, a multimillionaire philanthropist who sponsored the private Foxcatcher wrestling team at an amateur sports center known as Foxcatcher Farm that he set up on his estate in Pennsylvania. In January 1996, Schultz was shot and killed by du Pont. du Pont would be convicted of third-degree murder and was sentenced to thirteen to thirty years for prison.

==Early life==
David Lesley Schultz was born in Palo Alto, California, to Dorothy Jean St. Germain (née Rich) and Phillip Gary Schultz. He was the brother of Mark Schultz, and two half-siblings – Michael and Seana. Schultz was of half Belarusian-Jewish and half British/Irish/French/German descent. His paternal grandparents were Estelle (Bernstein), the daughter of a prominent paper company executive, and Maxwell L. Schultz, a business consultant. His maternal grandparents were Dorothy (Starks), a radiologist who graduated from Stanford Medical School #1 in her class, and Willis Rich, a Stanford ichthyology professor, inventor of the salmon ladder and discoverer of the &quot;home stream theory&quot; that salmon return to the rivers where they were born in order to spawn before they die. He said in a video that he was a Christian by faith.

As a young child, Dave was overweight (nicknamed &quot;Pudge&quot;), and was often bullied at school by classmates for his weight and appearance. He also had dyslexia, which many of his teachers mistook for mental disabilities.

Schultz began wrestling in junior high school at David Starr Jordan Middle School in Palo Alto coached by Robert Hoskins. In 1977 as a senior at Palo Alto High School, he became state champion. That year he also won both his first national and international wrestling titles. As a high school senior he pinned 2-time NCAA champion and NCAA &quot;Outstanding Wrestler&quot; Chuck Yagla at the Great Plains Championships. His brother Mark started competing in sports in gymnastics, winning the Northern California All-Around Gymnastics Championships in his age group. In his junior year he switched to wrestling, and in his senior year won state.

==Wrestling career==
=== High school career ===
Schultz&#x27;s high school wrestling records included winning first place in the prestigious Great Plains freestyle tournament, which qualified him to compete on his first U.S. international team in the Tbilisi Tournament in then-Soviet Georgia. The Tbilisi Tournament is considered by many experts in the wrestling community to be the &quot;toughest tournament in the world.&quot; Schultz earned a silver medal and was the highest-placing American at the tournament. Due to the timing of Tbilisi, Schultz was not able to compete in the high school tournaments that were required to qualify for the California State Championships, but his coach Ed Hart successfully petitioned the state coaches association to allow him to compete. Wrestling two weight classes above his normal division, Schultz pinned all his opponents in the state championships but the last, whom he defeated 12–1 in the final match. Later that year he won his first national title by winning the U.S. National Open Greco-Roman Championships and won the award for most falls in the least amount of time. Schultz&#x27;s senior year is considered by most experts as the most successful senior year in U.S. high school wrestling history.

=== College ===
In college, Schultz was a three-time NCAA All-American, first at Oklahoma State University and then twice at the University of Oklahoma. In 1982, he was the 167-pound weight class NCAA Champion defeating Mike Sheets from Oklahoma State University in the finals by criteria tie-breaker in overtime. His career collegiate record was 91–8: 30–4 at Oklahoma State University, 61–4 at the University of Oklahoma.

=== World and Olympics career ===
Schultz won ten Senior National titles (eight in Freestyle and two in Greco-Roman) over a 19-year span, at three weight divisions: 149.9 lb, 163 lb and 180.5 lb. In international competition, Schultz won a 1983 World Championship and a 1984 Olympic gold medal, competing with the United States team. Schultz won the gold medal at the 74 kg weight class over Martin Knosp from West Germany. He won four World Cup and two Pan American Games titles, and is the only American ever to twice win the tournament in Tbilisi, Georgia. In all, he was a seven-time World and Olympic medalist. Together, Dave and his brother Mark Schultz, along with the Banach brothers, were the first American brothers to each win gold medals in the same Olympics, and likewise the only American brothers to win both World and Olympic championships.

=== Coaching and post professional career ===
At various times, Schultz also served as an assistant coach at the University of Oklahoma, Stanford University, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Among many other top U.S. wrestlers, Schultz trained 1996 Olympic Gold Medalist Kurt Angle, who later became a professional wrestler. In the 1990s, he worked as a coach for John du Pont&#x27;s &quot;Team Foxcatcher&quot;, which trained at a complex built on the du Pont family farm in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. In 1996, Schultz was murdered there by John du Pont.

==Murder==
Schultz trained at the Foxcatcher center while preparing for another Olympic bid, as well as coaching the wrestling team. On January 26, 1996, he was shot and killed by John du Pont, the owner of the center. Du Pont had exhibited bizarre and threatening behavior for an extended period preceding the murder.

Schultz was 36 at the time of his death. His body was cremated. Schultz&#x27;s surviving family included his wife Nancy, his son Alexander, his daughter Danielle, his siblings, and both parents.

At the trial, neither the prosecution nor the defense suggested a motive for the crime. A jury rejected du Pont&#x27;s plea of not guilty by reason of insanity; he was convicted as guilty but mentally ill. Du Pont was sentenced by Judge Patricia Jenkins to 13–30 years incarceration and died in prison on December 9, 2010. Schultz&#x27;s father Philip told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the fact that he&#x27;s officially gone is almost a moot point. I did forgive the man for what he did. I never forgave the act.&quot;

The story of the events leading to his death are portrayed in the 2014 film &quot;Foxcatcher&quot;, with Schultz portrayed by Mark Ruffalo.

==Legacy==
After Schultz&#x27;s murder, 20 former Foxcatcher athletes were left without training or coaching resources six months before the 1996 Olympic Games. Schultz&#x27;s widow founded the Dave Schultz Wrestling Club in March 1996 to sponsor the stranded wrestlers through the Olympics. The Club succeeded beyond the initial goal. It continued to train athletes in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling until it closed in 2005. Among the wrestlers who competed under Dave Schultz WC sponsorship were Olympic gold medalists Kurt Angle (100 kg/220 lbs Men&#x27;s Freestyle, 1996) and Brandon Slay (76 kg/167.5 lbs Men&#x27;s Freestyle, 2000), Olympic bronze medalist Patricia Miranda (48 kg/105.5 lbs Women&#x27;s Freestyle, 2004), and World Champion Stephen Neal (130 kg/286 lbs. Men&#x27;s Freestyle, 1999).

* Since Schultz&#x27;s death, USA Wrestling has hosted the annual Dave Schultz Memorial International wrestling meet at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
* In 1997, Schultz was posthumously inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member.

The award is equally based on wrestling success, scholastic achievement, and community service.
* In 2016, United World Wrestling posthumously inducted Schultz into its Hall of Fame.

==Representation in other media==
* The 2014 film &quot;Foxcatcher&quot;, directed by Bennett Miller, with Mark Ruffalo playing Schultz, Steve Carell as du Pont and Channing Tatum as Mark, is based on Mark Schultz&#x27;s relationship with du Pont. For his portrayal of Dave, Ruffalo was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
* Dave&#x27;s brother Mark Schultz wrote a non-fiction book, &quot;Foxcatcher: The True Story of My Brother&#x27;s Murder, John du Pont&#x27;s Madness, and the Quest for Olympic Gold&quot; (2014).
* The story of John du Pont, David Schultz, and Team Foxcatcher is documented in &quot;The Prince of Pennsylvania&quot;, a documentary film directed by Jesse Vile for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series.

<text>Rock and roll is a style of popular American music which has spread around the world, including to the North Atlantic island nation of Iceland.

==History==
Rock came to the island beginning in the mid-1950s. Rock&#x27;s popularity increased steadily over the next few years. This wave peaked with the tour by Tony Crombie &amp; His Rockets in May 1957. A few bands with their own style did emerge, however, including City, Disco and Lúdó.

From 1930 until the mid-1980s, radio broadcasting in Iceland was a state monopoly which did not allow much time for rock music. But despite this state of affairs, Icelandic popular culture was not completely isolated from the outside world. Crews of Icelandic fishing boats and commercial aircraft would buy rock records in America, England and Germany and bring them back home to Iceland. Also, the US Navy base in Keflavík, Iceland, operated a radio station for the troops (AFRS 1484 on the radio dial) that mainly played rock music and was very popular with young Icelanders in the Reykjavík area and remained important to Icelandic rock music until at least the mid-1970s. Some of the disc-jockeys from the early &#x27;70s were Tom Wiecks, Jim Roark, Karl Phillips, Ron Smart, Tom Hughes and Mark Lazar.

The British Invasion and Beatlemania arrived in Iceland in 1964, and the indigenous groups Hljómar from Keflavík and Dátar from Reykjavík arose as Icelandic counterparts to The Beatles, later followed by Flowers, Bendix and other bands. Beginning in about 1969, the English language period of Icelandic rock began, with bands like Trúbrot, Náttúra and Pelikan becoming popular.

From 1973 to 1979, the Reykjavík rock scene was dominated by progressive rock and funk groups such as Eik and Cabaret (these two groups merged under the name Eik in 1977).

The mid to late 1970s saw the rise of Gunnar Þórðarson and Magnús Eiríksson, who revitalized the field of Icelandic rock and created a more distinctive national style. A wave of punk rock based out of Reykjavík occurred in about 1981 and temporarily displaced more traditional rock music, much like rock had displaced jazz in the early 1960s. Notable mid to late 1980s Icelandic rock bands include Grafík and Tobmobile as well as the alternative rock band The Sugarcubes featuring Björk. Towards the end of the 20th century and continuing to the present (2005), the group Quarashi with its mixture of rock and rap has achieved international attention; the same applies to the hard rock group Mínus and the post-rock band Sigur Rós. From the late 1980s continuing to the present (2005) the band Sálin hans Jóns míns or just Sálin has had a strong presence on the Icelandic rock scene.

<text>Zamrock is a musical genre that emerged and gained popularity in Zambia during the early 1970s. It has been described as a fusion of traditional African music and psychedelic rock, garage rock, hard rock, blues and funk, taking influence from popular bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, the Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, and Cream.

Rock musician Rikki Ililonga and his band Musi-O-Tunya are widely regarded as the inventors of this style of music. Other notable artists include WITCH, The Peace, Amanaz, Chrissy &quot;Zebby&quot; Tembo, and Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family.

Though it is no longer as popular in the country as it once was due to Zambia&#x27;s economic difficulties in the late 1970s, Zamrock has seen a recent resurgence, led by former WITCH member Emmanuel Chanda, better known as Jagari.

== History ==
Zamrock&#x27;s roots can be traced back to the 1950s, with northern singers from the Copperbelt Province such as Stephen Tsotsi Kasumali, William Mapulanga, and John Lushi. Zamrock as a musical movement came of age in the turbulent first decade after Zambia&#x27;s independence from British colonialism, rising and falling in tandem with the country&#x27;s economic success. Zambia&#x27;s boom from its copper mines led to a bust when copper prices fell and the country was devastated by the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.

After the country announced its independence in 1964, then-president Kenneth Kaunda introduced the slogan, &quot;One Zambia, one nation&quot; to promote unity. In order to celebrate the culture of the newly independent nation, Kaunda decreed that 95% of music played on radio stations had to be Zambian in origin. Since Western rock was popular in Africa, many Zamrock artists were inspired by bands that were popular in the West and adopted similar styles to those playing on British and American radios.

The rush to urbanization in mine-adjacent regions meant a variety of new artistic styles. The country&#x27;s newfound wealth brought with it urban sensibilities and a surge in interest in electric guitar use. Zamrock player Paul Ngozi of the Ngozi Family is credited with creating the kalindula sound, a rhythmic pop music sound with fuzzy electric guitar leads centred around the bass guitar of the same name.

While the price of copper fell and Zambia&#x27;s economy crashed, Zambia found itself surrounded by political turmoil in neighbouring states. This conflict led to a rise in anti-establishment messages in Zamrock music. When the country offered to shelter refugees, Zambia&#x27;s power stations were bombed. Once-prosperous cities were at the mercy of blackouts and curfews. Musicians were reduced to playing unstable sets during daylight hours while their ticket prices became unaffordable for most.

The AIDS epidemic played a huge part in bringing Zamrock to an end. The disease began to spread in the 1980s and has continued to devastate the nation since. It is estimated that between 1.2 million and 1.3 million have died from AIDS in Zambia as of 2019. Every member of WITCH except Emanuel &quot;Jagari&quot; Chanda had died of AIDS by 2001.

Furthermore, the rise of musical piracy had a significant impact on Zamrock artists. Bootleggers would copy and sell Zambian artists&#x27; music, forcing them to leave the industry and find work in other fields after losing their primary source of income.

Despite these challenges, Zamrock has yet to completely disappear from the world of music. A resurgence of interest across the globe in recent years, including reissues in North America and the production of a documentary, has allowed some Zamrock performers to tour, perform, and record new material.

Jagari from WITCH is one of these artists who has managed to make a comeback. In the last 5 years since his return in 2017, he has performed in several European cities such as Moscow and Paris, something he never got the chance to do in his band&#x27;s prime. He has also toured around the United States, and been awarded for his achievements by the Zambian National Arts Council.

== About the music ==
Because the peak of Zamrock music occurred during a period of social unrest, much of the music released at the time reflected the difficulties that people were facing. Sometimes referred to as an aggressive genre, it addressed contentious issues such as racism in Southern Africa all while still maintaining an exuberant feel.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;Zamrock&quot; refers to the combination of Western rock with the distinct style of African music. Zambian DJ Manessah Phiri is credited with the creation of the term.

Zamrock is heavily influenced by psychedelic rock and funk music, popular Western genres of the 1970s. It shares many features of these genres, most notably wah wah and fuzz.

<text>The ballute (a portmanteau of &quot;balloon&quot; and &quot;parachute&quot;) is a parachute-like braking device optimized for use at high altitudes and supersonic velocities.

The original ballute configuration was invented in 1958 by the Goodyear company. The innovation soon caught the attention of other organisations, including NASA; the agency incorporated ballutes into the escape system of the Gemini spacecraft. It has subsequently seen extensive use within the aerospace sector as a means of retarding the descent of various payloads, such as sections of rockets and atmospheric probes. Various proposals involving ballutes, such as for deorbiting/recovering low-mass satellites and interplanetary research programmes, have been issued in recent decades.

==Design==
The ballute is an inflatable device used to generate drag. In terms of its basic configuration, it is a cone-shaped balloon, featuring a toroidal burble fence (an inflated structure intended to ensure flow separation) that is fitted around its widest point. The burble fence acts to stabilize the ballute as it decelerates through different flow regimes, typically descending from faster (even supersonic) flows into subsonic speeds. The design of the ballute, particularly its drop-like shaping, make it more suitable for decelerating at extreme speeds than a conventional parachute.Ballutes can be categorised into three primary configuration, these being cocoon ballutes that enclose their payloads, attached ballutes that attach directly to the base of their payloads, and towed ballutes that trail after their payloads. The isotensoid ballute has been recognised as the standard configuration, although other arrangements have been tested. It has been proposed that ballutes could be arranged in both stacked toroidal and tension cone form factors. Some ballute configurations are specialised to certain purposes or industries, such as the aerospace sector.

By attaching a ballute to an air-dropped object, such as a bomb or an aerospace payload, it should (provided it is of sufficient size and has correctly deployed) limit its rate of descent, potentially minimising damage to the payload on contact with the ground. They can generate a relatively high amount of drag for their mass, making them attractive in weight-constrained scenarios typical to aerospace applications.

Inflation of a ballute is typically achieved either by a gas generator or by external air being forced into the structure by an arrangement of ram air inlets. The design of the inflation mechanism is particularly critical to its successful application; if the inlets are too small or too few, the ballute shall not maintain its shape and collapse, while excessive inlet flow likely results in overpressure and raising the risk of bursting. Accordingly, the ballute has to be precisely designed to conform with the environmental conditions it is to be exposed to; similarly, the deployment ought to be with similar care, such as in respect to timing. Improper deployment is likely to cause failure, as excessive deceleration forces risk snapping fixing points and tearing fabric; tangling is another potential risk.

==Applications==
The ballute was originally developed in response to the instability of early supersonic parachutes, proving to be an attractive alternative.

The ballute has been used on freefall bombs dropped from an aircraft, helping to both retard and stabilise the descent.

The ballute has been extensively used through the aerospace industry. One of its earliest uses in the sector was as an element of the astronaut&#x27;s launch escape equipment aboard NASA&#x27;s Gemini spacecraft; it was also being used to slow down the descent of the Arcas, an early American rocketsondes, by the mid-1960s. During the 1960s, the agency performed detailed research into the ballute as an aerodynamic decelerator system on other planets, such as Mars. 

In the 1984 film &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;, a ballute is used on the &quot;Leonov&quot; spacecraft to shield it from the effects of heating during aerobraking, allowing the &quot;Leonov&quot; to slow itself without expending fuel and establish an orbit around Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io.

In 2000, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory was researching the ballute, emphasising its potential for use in both aerocapture and aerobraking operations. Around that same period, the European Space Agency was also evaluating the use of inflatable shielding as a means of facilitating the controlled reentry of spacecraft.

Various proposed interplanetary atmospheric probes have incorporated ballutes; for envisioned missions to Venus, they shall act not only to control atmospheric entry but to provide buoyant support for the sensor payload as well. Landers on Mars may also use ballutes during direct atmospheric entry, while cocoon-style ballutes may also be adopted for orbital transfer vehicles in orbit around Earth. Particularly large ballutes may be used for planetary aerocapture purposes on various planetary bodies around the Solar System. Furthermore, extended designs using inflatable tension cone ballute technology have been proposed for deorbiting NanoSats and recovering low-mass (&lt; ) satellites from low Earth orbit.

In early 2012, Armadillo Aerospace used a ballute during the testing of its STIG-A rocket. In February 2015, the Danish nonprofit aerospace organisation Copenhagen Suborbitals were engaged in testing a ballute for its Nexø rockets. In April 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that SpaceX would recover Falcon 9 second stages with the help of a &quot;giant party balloon&quot;, after the company started landing the rocket&#x27;s first stages routinely. However, the plan was called off. In August 2019, Peter Beck, founder and CEO of Rocket Lab, announced that they would attempt to recover their Electron rocket&#x27;s lower stage utilising a ballute for supersonic deceleration, enabling the stage to be captured in mid-air by a helicopter.

<doc id="1233531" wikidata="Q2537872" url="?curid=1233531" title="Thank You (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Thank You is the eighth studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran. It was released on 27 March 1995 by Parlophone. Consisting of cover versions, the album performed moderately on the charts, reaching number 12 on the UK Albums Chart and number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but received negative reviews from critics.

The title track, (&quot;Thank You&quot;, originally by Led Zeppelin) originally appeared in an edited form (5:06) on the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;With Honors&quot;. A still shorter edit (4:32) later appeared on &quot;&quot;, a month before the full version was included on this album.

==Critical reception==

The two singles from the album were covers of Grandmaster Melle Mel&#x27;s &quot;White Lines (Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t Do It)&quot; and Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Day&quot;. &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot; was a single in Italy and in Spain.

J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;some of the ideas at play here are stunningly wrongheaded, like the easy-listening arrangement given Elvis Costello&#x27;s &#x27;Watching the Detectives&#x27; or the version of Zeppelin&#x27;s &#x27;Thank You&#x27; that sounds like the band is covering Chris DeBurgh. But it takes a certain demented genius to recognize Iggy Pop&#x27;s &#x27;Success&#x27; as the Gary Glitter tune it was meant to be or to redo &#x27;911 Is a Joke&#x27; so it sounds more like Beck than like Public Enemy.&quot;

In 2006, the album was declared the worst album of all time by &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

&quot;Perfect Day&quot; was the first single from &quot;Thank You&quot; and became a moderate hit, peaking at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. In the US the song narrowly failed to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, only &quot;bubbling under&quot; as high as number 101 from 24 June to 8 July 1995. The B-side of the single was a version of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s song &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, previously available in 1993, on Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Wedding Album&quot;.

Lou Reed said on the electronic press kit that accompanied the album that Duran Duran&#x27;s version of &quot;Perfect Day&quot; was &quot;the best cover ever completed of one of my own songs&quot;.

<doc id="1233538" wikidata="Q2631396" url="?curid=1233538" title="Brazilian rock">
<text>Brazilian rock refers to rock music produced in Brazil and usually sung in Portuguese. In the 1960s, it was known as , the Portuguese transcription of the line &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; from the Beatles song &quot;She Loves You&quot;.

==Overview==
Rock entered the Brazilian music scene in 1956 with the screening of the film &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot;, featuring Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, later covered in Portuguese by Nora Ney.

The electric guitar was introduced to Brazil in 1948, specifically in Salvador, by the carnival group Dodô e Osmar. They developed an instrument they called the &quot;pau elétrico&quot; (&quot;electric stick&quot;), notable for being the first electric guitar designed to eliminate microphonic feedback while producing a characteristic sustained sound. In 1949, Dodô and Osmar pioneered the use of this electric guitar in carnival celebrations, performing songs from an open car they dubbed the Trio Elétrico as they traveled through the streets of Salvador. This innovation has endured, evolving into today&#x27;s large trucks that continue the tradition of mobile musical performances during Carnival.

==1950s==
In 1957, the first original Brazilian rock and roll song, &quot;Rock and roll em Copacabana&quot;, was penned by Miguel Gustavo. This pioneering track was recorded by the singer Cauby Peixoto and rose to #52 on the charts that year.

During this period, several bands performed songs that were rough translations of English lyrics, though several groups chose to focus on instrumental rock instead. This was in part inspired by instrumental bands such as Duane Eddy and The Champs. In 1958, this inspiration led to the release of the first Brazilian instrumental rock song, &quot;Here&#x27;s the Blue Jean Rockers&quot; by The Blue Jean Rockers [pt]. Later the same year, Bolão &amp; His Rockettes went on to record the country&#x27;s first purely instrumental LP. These developments were crucial in establishing rock as a popular genre among Brazilian youth. Following these pioneering efforts, a wave of new bands emerged, including The Avalons, The Clevers [pt], The Rebels, The Jordans [pt], The Jet Blacks, The Pops, Os Populares, The Bells, The Lions, and The Youngs, further solidifying rock&#x27;s place in Brazilian music culture.

1958 marked a watershed moment for Brazilian rock, witnessing the meteoric rise of several artists and bands. Notable figures such as Nora Ney, Nick Savoia, Celly Campelo, Tony Campelo (Celly Campelo&#x27;s brother), , , Cinderella, Regiane, Ronnie Cord, and Hamilton di Giorgio achieved rapid success, establishing themselves as prominent names in the music scene virtually overnight. Additionally, instrumental groups such as the aforementioned Avalons, Tte Rebels, the Jordans, and Os Incríveis also gained widespread popularity, contributing to the vibrant and diverse landscape of Brazilian rock during this pivotal year.

==1960s==

When rock and roll took America by storm, Bill Haley and Elvis Presley also became liberating icons for Brazilian youth, who felt that they were under sexual and educational oppression, as Brazilian society had been based on the standards and rules of the Catholic church after colonization. Some movie theaters were wrecked during the showing of rock and roll movies.

Some radio disc-jockeys and recording companies set out to find new talents that could not only sing, but could also do it in perfect English.

Raul Seixas formed the first rock band from Salvador in 1965, the Panthers, which soon changed its name to Raulzito e os Panteras. Seixas was influenced by Luiz Gonzaga.

In 1963, Roberto Carlos had two hits: &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, a Bobby Darin cover with Portuguese lyrics by Erasmo Carlos, and &quot;Parei na Contramão&quot; (&quot;I stopped at the wrong way&quot;), the first collaboration between Erasmo and Roberto Carlos. Roberto and Erasmo created Jovem Guarda. The beginning of the Jovem Guarda, with Roberto Carlos, Erasmo Carlos and Wanderléa, was a kind of Brazilian version of the North American garage bands in the 1960s but with a bit of influence from artists like Otis Redding. Ronnie Von started his career with the garage influence of Jovem Guarda, and his work unleashed the psychedelic style and he was who suggested the name of the band Os Mutantes. Jerry Adriani is identified with the Jovem Guarda too, but his influence on Brazilian rock is greater with his Italian rock/pop style: he brought Raul Seixas from Salvador to success afterward in Rio de Janeiro, allowing for his widespread national success and influence to future generations. Other artists and bands associated with the Jovem Guarda include Eduardo Araújo (and his late wife, ), , , , Golden Boys, , Vanusa and The Fevers.

Jorge Ben Jor (then known only as Jorge Ben) had several hits and transited between Jovem Guarda and a new form of playing guitar, with a rhythmic form that he invented. This new style was named Samba-rock, a style which would be followed by Banda Black Rio, Trio Mocotó, , , and Wilson Simonal, among others.

The band The Bubbles, formed in 1965 in Rio de Janeiro, along with , who released his first album in 1966, served as a bridge between psychedelic rock and the garage rock of Jovem Guarda. In São Paulo Os Baobás made their mark by recording cover versions of songs by The Kinks, Love, Turtles and the Rolling Stones, during the beginning of their activities. From the 1960s, Os Primitivos, hailing from Brasília, blended traditional folk rock (reminiscent of the Byrds) with Brazilian Northeastern folk music such as baião. Other bands that straddled the line between garage rock and Jovem Guarda, while also hinting at the beginning of psychedelia, were: , and .

In the legendary show named &quot;&quot;, in 1964, the first Brazilian genuine musical, represented the black people, , the people from the Northeastern region, and Nara Leão (then substituted by Maria Bethânia) represented the woman from the Brazilian high society. The innovative proposal of this show changed Brazilian music forever from the post-Bossa Nova period because it introduced other Brazilian genres to popular music. Sometimes, with the protest characteristic, the MPB base was formed: Chico Buarque, Edu Lobo, Geraldo Vandré, Sérgio Ricardo, João Donato, Eumir Deodato, Roberto Menescal, MPB4, Quarteto em Cy, Francis Hime, and Joyce, arising from Bossa Nova, despite the music is not rock, their collaboration is important on almost all popular urban genres, including the rock. In 1969, Marcos Valle, who belonged to the second generation of the Bossa Nova, changed his style to a psychedelic rock and soul music Brazilian concept, and his brother Paulo Sérgio Valle went in a similar way. is a very important musician for the MPB transformation process because he included rock and the 60s and 70s international pop in his music. From this post-bossa nova time, Tuca, a female singer/songwriter, traveled to Europe in 1969, settling in Paris for six years (she has performed for several countries including Spain, Italy, and Holland) when in 1971 Françoise Hardy released the album &quot;La question&quot;, the result of a close partnership between both and thereafter, her performance turned more rocker.

The Tropicália movement turned the psychedelic rock and the use of electric instruments more popular in Brazilian music. Some &quot;tropicalistas&quot; were: Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé, Gal Costa, Rogério Duprat, Torquato Neto, Nara Leão, and others. The seminal &quot;tropicalista&quot; Os Mutantes influenced and tended the psychedelic rock and roll and is one reference for several relevant bands and musicians in the world.

Clube da Esquina, a group of friends from Minas Gerais, one of the most culturally prolific regions of Brazil, was joined with the Tropicália and Jovem Guarda responsible for the diffusion on a bigger scale by the electrification of the pop and rock music, with a universal, but Brazilian proposal. Some musicians from this group are: Milton Nascimento, Lô Borges, Toninho Horta, Beto Guedes, , , and the band .

==1970s==

The 1970s started with progressive rock, hard rock, and glam rock, but was a period of mutual interference between Brazilian pop music MPB and rock.

Rita Lee (former Mutantes vocalist) started her own work with her band Tutti Frutti, with glam rock-like aesthetics. Other bands from this period include Casa das Máquinas with its music between glam-hard-rock and progressive, (also formed by a former Mutantes member, Arnaldo Baptista) between progressive and Hard rock, with its hard rock (but in some songs already with the minimal characteristic of punk rock), the pure hard rock of Bixo da Seda, , with his pure glam rock and the proto-metal band .

There were many progressive rock bands in Brazil, such as O Terço, Mutantes (without Rita Lee), A Bolha (Hard rock with Progressive mix), , which made the remarkable album with Olivia Byington &quot;Corra o Risco&quot;, , Bixo da Seda, (in which Lulu Santos and Lobão started their musical careers), and Bacamarte, some of which have become well known in Europe and the US by progressive fans. The progressive rock band had an experimental characteristic: jazz, bossa nova, contemporary music, impressionist music with the traditional folk and baroque from State of Minas Gerais resulting in a kind of a Brazilian art rock version, and with renowned musicians: Wagner Tiso, Zé Rodrix, , , . Lula Côrtes and Zé Ramalho with their album Paêbirú that was originally released in 1975 (see 1975 in music), despite representing very well the Brazilian psychedelic movement of the 1960s and 1970s, it can also be considered like an experimental mix of progressive rock and Brazilian northeast folk music certainly. Another band with only one album, but today considered a classic of Brazilian rock is with the work of the same name released in 1972: a forceful melodic Brazilian folk music with a vocal that remember The Byrds, and a bit of progressive rock and jazz, consistent orchestral arranges, and the famous Jorge Amiden&#x27;s &quot;tritarra&quot; (a guitar with three arms).

From that period, a genre known as &quot;&quot; emerged, blending Brazilian folk music with rock. Notable artists in this genre include Zé Rodrix, Ave Sangria, Sá &amp; Guarabyra, , . This movement also saw a radical form of Brazilian folk music, which sometimes overlapped with rock, significantly influencing Brazilian rock at the time. Artists like , , , Sérgio Reis, led this trend, followed by Almir Sater and Renato Teixeira in the 1980s. Marlui Miranda, known for her expertise in Brazilian indigenous music, represents an even more radical departure. Though her music is not traditionally categorized as rock, her innovative folk compositions contributed to the alternative aesthetic.

The &quot;carioca&quot; (from Rio de Janeiro city) Azymuth, was formed in 1969 and is the Jazz rock side of this generation, but is responsible for the Brazilian pop music development too. There are great musicians that can add up here - Jazz rock influence: Airto Moreira, Raul de Souza, Flora Purim, Hermeto Pascoal, Naná Vasconcelos, Arthur Verocai, André Geraissati, Egberto Gismonti, Grupo D&#x27;Alma, Eumir Deodato, and Sérgio Mendes (with Funk influence too).

This higher mix between rock and Brazilian pop music resulted in several famous musicians and bands: Secos &amp; Molhados (identified as glam rock too), Raul Seixas, Novos Baianos, A Cor do Som, Robertinho do Recife and a union of Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Maria Bethânia and Gilberto Gil in the show named Doces Bárbaros. After the end of Secos &amp; Molhados, continued his career, and his first album was all glam, Ney Matogrosso continued with great success and was constructing an alternative career. Other musicians - that helped to turn the traditional Brazilian music more flexible, with powerful rock or pop influences - were a relative hit too, like Elis Regina, Alceu Valença, Geraldo Azevedo, Belchior, Gonzaguinha, Zé Ramalho, Raimundo Fagner, Luiz Melodia, , , Luli e Lucina and after the end of Novos Baianos, Baby Consuelo (then Baby do Brasil), Pepeu Gomes and Moraes Moreira, but there were musicians that made a more experimental mix, who didn&#x27;t have the same good luck in their careers and access to the media, and because of this are known as &quot;malditos&quot;, the darns, but at a later time they will be an important reference for the second Brazilian alternative scene - they are: , Walter Franco, Jorge Mautner, Jards Macalé, Taiguara, Arnaldo Baptista (Mutantes) and Sérgio Sampaio. Marku Ribas is the side more Black music of this group and was Bob Marley&#x27;s friend in the 1970s, Jamaica, where he lived. On the other hand, Tim Maia, directly influenced by Soul music side of the Jovem Guarda, made several hits, and his style influenced bands like and in the 80s.

In the 1970s, several attempts were made to organize festivals in Brazil. The &quot;Festival de Verão de Guarapari&quot; (Guarapari Summer Festival) in 1971 aimed to be a significant hippie gathering but faced organizational issues. Despite this, it remains a historic event, featuring performances by Milton Nascimento and , A Bolha, Novos Baianos, Luiz Gonzaga and Tony Tornado. Another notable effort was the Primeiro Festival de Iacanga (First Iacanga Festival) in the State of São Paulo in 1975, held on a large farm with improved infrastructure. This festival became a landmark of the Brazilian underground, showcasing such bands as Jazzco, Apokalypsis, , , Ursa Maior, Rock da Mortalha, Orquestra Azul among others. The first Hollywood Rock festival took place in Rio, 1975 too, featuring performances by Raul Seixas, Rita Lee, O Terço, and others. Additionally, the 1970s saw two major international concerts in Brazil: Alice Cooper (1974) and Genesis (1977).

In the late 1970s, the progressive reference was still felt in Guilherme Arantes and 14 Bis (band).

===Disco influence===
Disco music, which arrived in Brazil in the 1970s, influenced artists such Rita Lee and Zé Rodrix. As Frenéticas became an instant phenomenon with their mix of Brazilian rock and disco.

===Punk===
The Brazilian punk rock scene emerged in the late 1970s in São Paulo, drawing inspiration from bands such as the Sex Pistols, MC5, Iggy &amp; The Stooges and The Ramones. . Douglas Viscaino, a pioneering musician, played a key role in adopting and nurturing punk culture. He united young people in opposition to Brazil&#x27;s military regime, channeling revolutionary ideas through the politically charged band Restos de Nada, which began performing in 1978. During the late 70s, interest in punk music rapidly expanded across the country. Early bands like AI-5 and N.A.I. (later known as Condutores de Cadáver) emerged in São Paulo, Carne Podre in Curitiba, and Aborto Elétrico in Brasília, marking the nationwide spread of the punk movement.

The first records from the end of the 1970s to the 1980s were demo tapes because Brazil had a dictatorial regime until 1985. From its beginnings, the Brazilian punk music style was more reminiscent of Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys than the Sex Pistols, that is, more akin to hardcore punk. An independent label named &quot;Punk Rock Discos&quot; was created at the beginning of the 1980s, which produced the first record of an individual Brazilian punk band, , a six-song record released in 1982. By the same label, the first long play by a Brazilian punk band appeared in the same year, the &quot;Grito Suburbano&quot; album, with three bands from São Paulo city: Cólera, Olho Sêco and the Inocentes. Some of these first records are rare and well paid for by collectors in Europe and Japan. Brazilian punk rock gained visibility in the international media in 1982 with &quot;O Começo do Fim do Mundo&quot;, a festival that peacefully gathered rival gangs for the first time, and it is one of the biggest punk festivals in the world today. In 1985, a band led by Brazilian musician Supla released its first LP through a major label. In 1986, Inocentes and Replicantes, too, when the Brazilian punk scene was already growing colder. In 1986, Cólera was the first Brazilian punk band to perform internationally, and then Ratos de Porão. In the 1990s, punk returned to the scene. Some examples of bands: , (electronic punk), , Ludovic, , Blind Pigs (today Porcos Cegos), , Flicts, Ação Direta, Ack, Gritando HC, Nitrominds, , , Motores, Pastel de Miolos, Sweet Suburbia, Hellsakura, Pupila Dilatada, Dance of Days. 

, former frontman of Replicantes, released his solo debut in 1996 with a creative punk fusion that he named &quot;Punk-brega&quot;.

The early Brazilian punk scene was immortalized in the documentary &quot;Botinada: A Origem do Punk no Brasil&quot; directed by former MTV VJ Gastão Moreira.

==1980s==



Even though the 1960s witnessed the phenomenon of Jovem Guarda and the 1970s saw the appearance of many prolific artists, like Raul Seixas, and bands like Os Mutantes, Brazilian rock&#x27;s explosion began in 1981 with the &quot;Brazilian new wave&quot;, later renamed &quot;the New Jovem Guarda&quot; by the media. Punk rock was already incorporated but Ska, Post-punk and brazilian ingredients was new. English new wave, with its surprising variety of styles, arrived in Brazil through groups and personalities such as the Agentss, Blitz, Camisa de Vênus, Barão Vermelho, Kid Abelha, Os Paralamas do Sucesso, Fausto Fawcett, Lulu Santos, Rádio Táxi, Sempre Livre, Marina Lima, Dr. Silvana &amp; Cia., Kiko Zambianchi, Engenheiros do Hawaii, RPM, Metrô, Ultraje a Rigor, Legião Urbana, Ira!, Titãs, Capital Inicial, Nenhum de Nós, Dulce Quental, Biquíni Cavadão, Zero, Violeta de Outono, Fellini, Vange Leonel, Os Cascavelletes, Black Future, Léo Jaime and João Penca e Seus Miquinhos Amestrados. Rock in Rio took over a million people to &quot;Cidade do Rock&quot; during the 10 days of the event, and established Brazil as a venue for international artists - some artists, like Santana and Queen, had come before this event, but the number of international attractions rose abruptly after Rock in Rio. 

Sepultra was formed in 1984 by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera; the band was a major force in the groove metal, thrash metal and death metal genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their later experiments drawing influence from alternative metal, world music, nu metal, hardcore punk, and industrial metal. 

From Minas Gerais, the instrumental group Uakti was debuting and despite their music not being rock in the classic meaning, their experimental music with the instruments built by the group (Anton Walter Smetak influence) started a new era in the Brazilian popular music.

The underground scene had - Post-punk with Jazz, Funk, Folk, Rap, Reggae, Art rock, Thrash metal, Dodecaphonic, and Atonal experience - experimental bands and musicians such as Arrigo Barnabé, Itamar Assumpção, , Robson Borba, , , , , Patife Band, Tiago Araripe, Os Mulheres Negras, - this group was identified as São Paulo Vanguard or &quot;Vanguarda Paulistana&quot;, from the beginning of the 1980s. Some &quot;cariocas&quot; (from Rio de Janeiro) representatives of this style are and Letícia Garcia.

On the other hand, had Hard rock, Punk rock and Heavy metal bands such as Vênus from the State of Piauí, , Viper, Korzus, Ratos de Porão, Mammoth and Karisma from the State of São Paulo, from the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Sepultura from the State of Minas Gerais, and Dorsal Atlântica from the State of Rio de Janeiro, from the mid to late 1980s - this last, the pioneer in the unification of this three styles of hard music. But one of the first bands of extreme metal from Brazil is Sarcófago, also from Belo Horizonte, formed in 1985. The female Thrash metal band Volkana was founded in 1987 in Brasília.

This movement is seen as a reflection of the worldview of urban youth who had grown up under a dictatorial regime and faced such processes as industrial expansion. This is the same generation that enjoyed the democratic &quot;abertura&quot; (opening) and began to absorb rather quickly an infinite amount of new information, previously inaccessible. The universe of that generation appeared rich in diversity, implying a desire to enjoy the present.

In the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s another group that mixes electronic music scene up appeared - in Santos, Campinas, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cities - Electronic post-punk, Industrial, EBM, Technopop, and the similar genres - and some bands and artists are well known in Europe: Loop B, Harry, Sicilian Unit, Individual Industry, Biopsy, Simbolo, City Limits, Tetine, Inhumanoids, Morgue, Suba (his album &quot;São Paulo Confessions&quot; is a worldwide milestone to the Electronic music), Tek Noir etc.

It&#x27;s important to emphasize that the history of the record label Baratos Afins became forever intertwined with the indie history in São Paulo and Brazil.

Two musicians and singer-songwriters, Renato Russo from Legião Urbana and Cazuza from Barão Vermelho, began brilliant solo careers from the 1980s to the 1990s but were HIV fatal victims.

==1990s==




At the start of the 1990s, the Brazilian music scene witnessed the birth of one of its most significant independent movements, influenced by British and American bands known for their loud, noisy guitar sounds, such as Sonic Youth, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, and The Telescopes. This movement was characterised by its use of loud, noisy guitars, intense feedback, energetic performances, and English lyrics. Guitar bands began to emerge throughout the country, drawing criticism from music journalists who frequently questioned these bands&#x27; proficiency in a foreign language.

The most influential guitar bands of this period were Maria Angélica Não Mora Mais Aqui, Pin Ups, Second Come, Killing Chainsaw, Mickey Junkies, PELVs, The Cigarettes, Low Dream, brincando de deus, , (started as a guitar band and later became hardcore), , Dash, Dago Red, Velouria, Shed, Dead Poets and Snooze.

This moment can be called the first Brazilian independent scene (or indie scene). It was time to Grunge and Britpop, the distorted colors, the development of hardcore, and a return to Punk. The independent festival Juntatribo in Campinas in 1993 and 1994 and BHRIF - Belo Horizonte Rock Independente Festival in Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais), in 1994 was a milestone and became the independent attitude a new option.

The 1990s also saw a resurgence in instrumental rock&#x27;s popularity, and some of the classic bands from previous decades reformed. Surf music also became popular, especially The Argonauts, The Gasolines, and Os Ostras. Hard Rock had in 1993 a new representative in Brazil, Dr. Sin. Heavy metal had two debuts: in 1990 Torture Squad and in 1991 Angra - all of these are from São Paulo.

Also in this period, many other bands acquired widespread national projection, such as: Raimundos (which was formed in the late 1980s, but only released its first album in 1994) with its style, Skank and O Rappa, both of which with a style that can be designated like a kind of reggae-rock, Pato Fu as the first &quot;indie&quot; band that arrived at mainstream, Charlie Brown Jr., with its alternative rock with rap and skate punk influences, and Mamonas Assassinas, who was a great hit with humour and rock but its members died in a tragic plane accident (1996). Also, Jota Quest was a success since the first album, 1996, and they arrived with a powerful pop-rock-funk.

From the end of the 1980s to beginning of the 1990s names like Planet Hemp, Karnak, , , , Graforreia Xilarmônica, Okotô and Boi Mamão are prominent.

The MTV Brasil Unplugged format brought back to the mainstream some bands whose career had been mainly consolidated in the 1980s, like the Titãs in 1997, Capital Inicial in 2000, Ira! in 2004 and Lobão in 2007.

At the beginning of the 1990s there was the Manguebeat (or Mangue Bit) movement that put Recife definitively as one of the principal places that has an important modern rock scene. Its style is a cross between the local rhythms, like Maracatu, and rock, hip hop and electronic music. Coming from this movement are Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi (who shortened their name to only Nação Zumbi following Science&#x27;s death), Mundo Livre S/A, Fred 04, DJ Dolores, , Otto etc.

Kurt Cobain after his shows in Brazil with Nirvana in 1993 helped spread the Brazilian rock in the world. David Byrne, Beck, Of Montreal, Devendra Banhart and others were influenced by the 1960s Tropicália and have divulged this musical style to the world. In the 1990s, Björk, Stereolab, Towa Tei, Amon Tobin and The High Llamas were approaching the Brazilian pop music increasingly.

Between the final 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century are relevant: Los Hermanos that is a noteworthy reference to the independent bands. Cássia Eller, who recorded several songs of the Brazilian rock musicians with powerful vocals and suddenly died in 2001. Pitty, the rarity of being a woman bandleader (with the band of the same name), has typified her career with brave lyrics and uncommon vocals. Lobão (who in the 1980s was mainstream) started his independent career and is obtaining a brilliant result, and the singer of Sepultura, Max Cavalera, left the band and started Soulfly with the same powerful Heavy metal.

The important hardcore scene from Brasília continued in this period with Raimundos and . In the highlight of Raimundos, Rodolfo Abrantes, the vocal, decided to go out and assembled a new band, , in 2002, but they continued with the typical creative explosion of hardcore into the end of the band, in 2004.

Some rock genres are very specific in Brazil, but with an important scene since the 90s like Grindcore, Guitar, Psychobilly, Death Metal, Ska Punk, etc. Some highlights are Tihuana, Sapo Banjo, Madame Machado, Rusty Machine, Kães Vadius, and Sick Sick Sinners. There are several festivals about these genres in Brazil with faithful fans in Brazil. Krisiun is an example of Death Metal band that is a hit of this genre abroad of Brazil: they toured extensively through North America, South America, and Europe (recording their first official DVD while in Poland).

==The early years of the 2000s==
The boundary between MPB - &quot;Música popular brasileira&quot; - and international electric pop and rock was largely broken with the &quot;TV Record Festival&quot; (1967), a milestone seen in the documentary &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Tropicalismo&quot;. Brazilian popular music resulted from a gradual union of regional folk music and contemporary urban references. However, in 1967, the dichotomy was evident (&quot;MPB&quot; versus electric music) because it was a visible beginning of the electric fusion in acoustic Brazilian music.

Musicians and bands of the 90s absorbed definitely the rock aesthetic in the &quot;MPB&quot; or vice versa: Chico César, Fernanda Abreu, Paula Morelenbaum, Adriana Calcanhotto, Lenine, Paulinho Moska, Ed Motta, Badi Assad, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Rei Zeca Baleiro, Lula Queiroga, Jair Oliveira, Wilson Simoninha, Léo Minax, Chico Amaral, Marina Machado, Bebel Gilberto, Zélia Duncan, Tony Platão (or Toni Platão), Pedro Mariano and Max de Castro.

In the first decade of the millennium, many musicians had already incorporated the new rock as an alternative aesthetic to this generation. This new fusion is encountered in , Vanessa da Mata who has done backing vocals for Black Uhuru, , CéU, Curumin, Orquestra Imperial, The +2&#x27;s, Mariana Aydar, Karina Buhr (see also Comadre Florzinha), Seu Jorge, , Nina Becker, , , , , , , Tulipa Ruiz, Thiago Pethit, Tiê, Marcelo Jeneci, , Moisés Santana, Miriam Maria, Jonas Sá, Sergio Molina, Cicero, M. Takara, , Sobrado 112, Banda Sincrônica, Pedro Osmar, Gutti Mendes, Marcelo Pretto, Orquestra Contemporânea de Olinda, Kristoff Silva, Lu Horta, and Mandrágora. The Vanessa da Mata songs &quot;Ai, Ai, Ai&quot; and &quot;Boa Sorte/Good Luck&quot; (with guest vocals by Ben Harper) became number-one hits in Brazil.

The real independent attitude also a growing audience at the beginning of the 21st century. There are a lot of opportunities with the festivals such as Bananada (Goiânia), Porão do Rock (Brasília), Camping Rock (Itabirito), Humaitá Pra Peixe (Rio de Janeiro), Grito Rock (itinerant), Fora do Eixo (itinerant), Abril Pro Rock (Recife), Goiânia Noise (Goiânia), Mada (festival) (Natal, Rio Grande do Norte), Calango (festival)(Cuiabá), Festival Garimpo (Belo Horizonte), Varadouro (Rio Branco), Rec-Beat (Recife), Jambolada (Uberlândia), Vaca Amarela (Goiânia) and independent labels (like , , Mondo 77, , Travolta Discos, Deckdisc, , Fora do Eixo Discos, Escárnio e Osso). It&#x27;s a moment of intense creativity. The Brazilian indie scene, with the support of the internet, MTV, and the festivals gain a captive audience. Part is influenced by the Hard Rock, Hardcore, Metal, and part is influenced by 1990s rock, after the Strokes and Radiohead &quot;boom&quot;. There are references to 1970s Brazilian music and Glam rock, Folk music (Brazilian or not), 1980s B-rock, from the 1980s São Paulo Vanguard, Jovem Guarda (the garage side of this genre), Tropicália, the Samba rock and the Black music revisited, Electro, Rap, Ska, Jazz, Dub music, Funk Carioca and part is influenced by almost every one of these genres. A large number of bands were created. Among pioneers from this period are Cachorro Grande, Tetine, Cordel do Fogo Encantado, Cansei de Ser Sexy (CSS), Autoramas, Cibelle, Udora, Pedro Luís e a Parede, , , , , , , , Canto dos Malditos na Terra do Nunca, , Lampirônicos, , , (instrumental), Zumbi do Mato, , Os Pistoleiros, Polara, Declinium, Pullovers, Mamelo Sound System, MQN, Vulgue Tolstoi, Flu, Doiseu Mimdoisema, Hipnóticos, Monokini, Sleepwalker, Astromato, The Butcher&#x27;s Orquestra, Grenade, Wado, The Charts, Astronautas, Módulo, China and O Grito. The term Post-rock is already well used in Brazil.

Some magazines in the English language in the beginning of the 2000s deemed some worldwide genres like electronic rock (using this term on the 2000s music) and new rave having some Brazilian bands not only as the exponents but builders of these movements. 2015 was the first year in history that no songs by Brazilian rock acts were present at the list of the 100 most played songs on Brazilian radio, according to research carried out by Crowley Broadcast Analysis.

== 2010s ==
Wannabe Jalva is a space groove rock band formed in 2011 by Tiago Abrahão (guitar/bass/seq), Felipe Puperi (vocal/guitar), Rafael Rocha (vocal/guitar/bass) and Fernando Paulista (drums) in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

<text>Émile Gentil (; 4 April 1866 – 30 March 1914) was a French colonial administrator, naval officer, and military leader. He headed two military missions to conquer and consolidate territories north from modern Gabon to Chad. In 1902 Gentil was named commissioner-general of the French Congo residing at Brazzaville. Gabon&#x27;s second-largest city Port-Gentil was named for him.

== Early life and military career ==
Born at Volmunster in the department of Moselle, he later attended the École Navale, the school that formed French naval officers. As an ensign, he was assigned to conduct hydrographic soundings along the Gabonese coast from 1890 to 1892. That year, he joined the colonial administration in Gabon.

==Missions to the African Interior==
===First Mission 1895–1897===
In 1895, Gentil was ordered to find a practical route to Chad, claiming the area between for France, and hence thwarting German and British expansion. On 27 July 1895, Gentil headed up the Congo River on the French steamship &quot;Léon-Blot&quot;. The ship was then dismantled and hauled by African laborers through the forest to reach navigable portions of the Oubangui, where he founded the French station at Fort-Archambault near one of Sultan Rabih az-Zubayr&#x27;s major towns, Kouno (now in the Chari-Baguirmi Region of Chad). The mission then transported the steamboat overland again to the Chari, which stretches to Lake Chad in the north.
In October 1897 he convinced the Sultan Abd ar Rahman Gwaranga to sign a treaty of alliance which gave France a protectorate over the Kingdom of Baguirmi, which was then threatened by Rabih az-Zubayr, the most powerful ruler in the Chad basin.

On 20 October Gentil&#x27;s mission passed through Rabih az-Zubayr, reaching Lake Chad on the 28th.

===Second Mission, 1899 (the Gentil Mission)===
After returning from France, where he had successfully lobbied the government to support further expansion, Gentil made preparations for a second Mission to seize the Chari-Baguirmi region and the area around Lake Chad from Rabih az-Zubayr. In 1899–1900, the French organized three armed columns: the Gentil Mission proceeding north from French Congo, the infamous Voulet–Chanoine Mission east from Niger and the Foureau-Lamy Mission south from Algeria. The objective was to link all French possessions in Western Africa.
Again supported by the steamboat &quot;Léon-Blot&quot;, Gentil&#x27;s force headed to the French station at Fort-Archambault Unbeknownst to them, a previous military expedition commanded by the Lieutenant de vaisseau Henri Bretonnet and the Lt. Solomon Braun, along with Sultan Gaourang&#x27;s Baguirmi forces had been annihilated by Rabih&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Togbao on 17 July after attacking Rabih at Kouno.

On 16 August, one of the three Senegalese tirailleurs who had survived reached Gentil and informed him of the battle.
The Gentil Mission burned the town of Kouno, and confronted Rabih at the Battle of Kouno on 28 October 1899. The French were pushed back, suffering losses, but this did not prevent them from linking up with the other missions at Kousséri on 21 April 1900, in what today is northern Cameroon. The next day the three columns commanded by Major Amédée-François Lamy confronted Rabih az-Zubayr, who still controlled most of Chad. The French won the ensuing Battle of Kousséri, ensuring them control of most of Chad, but the battle cost both commanders their lives. Rabih&#x27;s son succeeded him, but his empire soon disintegrated under sustained French expansion.

This meant that the original expedition had now accomplished all its main aims: surveying the lands of Northern Nigeria and Niger (contributing to a clearer Franco-British delimitation of the colonial borders), uniting with the Foureau-Lamy mission and destroying Rabih&#x27;s empire, which permitted the institution in September by the French government of the Military territory of Chad.

In Lamy&#x27;s honour, Émile Gentil, who was later its first French governor, named the capital of the new French territory of Chad Fort-Lamy. In 1973 the Republic of Chad renamed it N&#x27;Djamena.

==Governorship of French Congo==
On 5 February 1902 Gentil was named commissioner-general of the French Congo, residing at Brazzaville.

Gabon&#x27;s second-largest city was named Port-Gentil for him.

<doc id="1233558" wikidata="Q1135366" url="?curid=1233558" title="Vans">
<text>Vans (originally called the Van Doren Rubber Company) is an American apparel, accessories, and skateboarding shoes brand, established in Anaheim, California, and owned by VF Corporation. The company also sponsors surf, snowboarding, BMX, and motocross teams. since 1996 to 2019, and 2025, the brand has been a primary sponsor of the annual Warped Tour music festival.

==History==
===Founding and early history===

Paul Van Doren, his brother James, and Gordon C. Lee opened the first Vans store as &quot;The Van Doren Rubber Company&quot; on March 16, 1966, at 704 East Broadway in Anaheim, California. The business manufactured shoes and sold them directly to the public. Upon opening, twelve customers purchased Vans deck shoes (now called &quot;Authentic&quot;), similar to those manufactured by Keds but with a thicker sole. The store had display models of three styles of shoes, priced between US$2.49 and $4.99, but did not have any inventory ready to sell and Paul Van Doren did not have change to give customers; customers took their shoes home and came back the next day to pay.

===Middle history===
The original Vans skateboard logo was designed in Costa Mesa, California, in the 1970s by Mark Van Doren, son of then-President and co-owner James Van Doren, at age 13; Mark&#x27;s design was a stencil, allowing the logo to be spray-painted onto his skateboards. The design was incorporated into the heel tab on Style 95, an early Vans skateboard shoe. Mark&#x27;s interest in skateboarding is what led Vans to manufacture skateboarding shoes.

In 1976, Vans began using its &quot;Off The Wall&quot; motto, a slang phrase used by skateboarders while doing tricks in empty pools. Around this time, Vans released its Vans Side-stripe and Vans #36, also known as the &quot;Old Skool&quot; design.

In 1984, facing heavy competition and a market flooded with Vans counterfeits, Vans lowered its prices and eventually filed for bankruptcy protection. In 1988, Van Doren and Lee sold the company to banking firm McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co. for US$74.4 million. In 1989, many Vans counterfeiters were apprehended by the U.S. and Mexican governments and ordered to cease production.

By 1991, the company&#x27;s shoes were highly desired due to high demand and low supply. The company expanded internationally; released new models, including snowboard shoes; and was renamed Vans, Inc. to reflect its customers calling the shoes &quot;Vans&quot; for short. The same year, Vans went public at US$14 per share on NASDAQ. 

===Recent history===
In 2004, Vans merged with North Carolina–based VF Corporation. In 2016, in celebration of its 50th anniversary, Vans released a new logo and launched a campaign to target a wider audience. In 2022, Vans launched the new VR3 product line where 30% of the product is renewable, recycled or regenerative. VF Corporation will expand the VR3 product collection to more footwear and apparel categories.

==Partnerships==
Since 1999, Vans has sponsored and supported Warped Tour, the longest-running touring music festival to date in North America. In 2001, Warped Tour was rebranded as Vans Warped Tour.

Vans became the title sponsor of the US Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach, California, in 2014, and in 2010, the company sponsored the Duct Tape Invitational.

In 2022, to commence the US Open of Surfing period, Vans hosted the BMX Waffle Cup, a freestyle BMX invitational tournament. Their Huntington Beach skate park&#x27;s course was modified by BMX riders for the tournament, and was themed after the US Open.

==Public skate parks==
Vans opened its first skate park in 1998 at The Outlets at Orange, in Orange, California. It features a indoor street course, deep combo pool, area for amateurs, mini ramps, outdoor street course, and arcade. The park was updated in 2009. It has remained closed since March 2020, when BMX rider Tyler Kanarr died after sustaining major injuries in the park.

The company built its second skate park in Huntington Beach, California, which opened to the public in 2010. It includes a skate bowl and a skate plaza. The park is , and Vans pays the city US$1 per year for its 20-year lease.

There is a skate park in London, in The Old Vic Tunnels, called House of Vans.

== In pop culture ==
Vans&#x27; shoes have often been customized cosmetically by wearers, with many of their painting and drawing patterns being adopted by the company for their official models. Most notably, the checkerboard pattern, popular in ska and punk culture, was adopted after the company noticed skateboarders drawing it on their shoes.

Vans reached its nationwide popularity when, in 1982, Sean Penn wore a pair of Vans checkerboard slip-ons as character Jeff Spicoli in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;.

In 2016, the internet meme &quot;Damn Daniel&quot;, featuring California teen Daniel Lara wearing Vans, went viral. In appreciation, the company gave Lara a lifetime supply of Vans shoes.

The Major League Baseball pitcher Michael Lorenzen grew up skateboarding with Vans. , he plays baseball wearing customized Vans UltraRange Exos with cleats, rather than traditional baseball shoes. On August 9, 2023, Lorenzen became the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Vans; the Vans will be displayed in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

<text>Clare H. Torry (born 29 November 1947) is a British singer, known for performing the improvised, wordless vocals on the song &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. She sang the theme of the 1977 film &quot;OCE&quot; in the same style, and also covered the Dolly Parton single &quot;Love Is Like a Butterfly&quot; for the opening titles of the BBC TV series &quot;Butterflies&quot;, which ran for four series between 1978 and 1983.

==Early life==
Clare Torry was born in November 1947 in Marylebone, London, to Geoffrey Napier Torry (1916–1979), who combined careers as Lieutenant-Commander in the Fleet Air Arm and Flight Lieutenant in the RAF, and his wife Dorothy W. Singer (1916–2017), who was secretary to six BBC Directors-General.

==Career==
In the 1960s Torry began a career as a singer, mostly performing covers of popular songs which included session work at Abbey Road Studios. She later worked as a staff songwriter for EMI.

In January 1973, Pink Floyd were finishing work on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; at Abbey Road, and a female singer was needed to add vocals to an instrumental composition by Richard Wright to be called &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;. Engineer Alan Parsons remembered having been impressed by Torry&#x27;s voice, and she was booked for a session on Sunday 21 January.

On 4 November 1973, Torry sang &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; at the Rainbow Theatre in London. She sang it with Pink Floyd again at their 1990 concert at Knebworth, and with Roger Waters at some of his 1980s solo shows. She also contributed to Waters&#x27; 1986 soundtrack &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; and to his 1987 album &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot;.

Torry performed as a session singer on 1970s UK TV adverts, and as a live backing vocalist with Kevin Ayers, Olivia Newton-John, Shriekback, The Alan Parsons Project (for whom she also sang lead vocal on one track on 1979&#x27;s &quot;Eve&quot;), Procol Harum mainman Gary Brooker, Matthew Fisher, Cerrone, Meat Loaf (a duet on the song &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;, and the hit &quot;Modern Girl&quot;), Johnny Mercer and Doctors of Madness.

She performed Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Love Is Like a Butterfly&quot; as the theme music to the 1970s Wendy Craig/Geoffrey Palmer, Carla Lane sitcom &quot;Butterflies&quot;. The song was released as a single in 1981. Torry also released &quot;Love for Living&quot; in 1969, which was produced by Ronnie Scott and Robin Gibb. She sang the theme of the 1977 film &quot;OCE&quot; in the same style as &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;.

In the 1970s she appeared on the French disco composer Cerrone&#x27;s &quot;Angelina&quot;, the Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold Back&quot;, and albums by Olivia Newton-John and Serge Gainsbourg. Her voice can be heard singing &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; (originally by Donna Summer) during the opening scene of the cult BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot; production of &quot;Abigail&#x27;s Party&quot; in 1977. Torry sang backing vocals on the track &quot;The War Song&quot; from Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Waking Up with the House on Fire&quot; album in 1984, as well as on the track &quot;Yellowstone Park&quot; on the Tangerine Dream album &quot;Le Parc&quot; the following year.

Torry is also credited on the 1987 album &quot;En Dejlig Torsdag&quot; (&quot;A Lovely Thursday&quot;) by the Danish pop rock band TV-2, where she sings in a fashion similar to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; at the end of the tracks &quot;Stjernen I Mit Liv&quot; (&quot;The Star in my Life&quot;) and &quot;I Baronessens Seng&quot; (&quot;In the Bed of the Baroness&quot;).

On 20 October 2010, Torry was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of her unique contribution to music.

==Lawsuit==
In 2004, Torry sued Pink Floyd and EMI for songwriting royalties on the basis that her contribution to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; constituted co-authorship with keyboardist Richard Wright. In 1973, as a session singer, she was paid only the standard flat fee of £30 for Sunday studio work (the equivalent of £400 in 2022). She said in 1998, &quot;If I&#x27;d known then what I know now, I would have done something about organising copyright or publishing.&quot; In 2005, an out-of-court settlement was reached in Torry&#x27;s favour, although the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. All releases after 2005 carry an additional credit for &quot;Vocal composition by Clare Torry&quot; in the &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; segment of the booklet or liner notes.

== Later work ==
In February 2006, Torry released &quot;Heaven in the Sky&quot;, a collection of her early pop recordings from the 1960s and 1970s. In 2011, she released a collaboration with musician and composer John Fyffe.

<text>Derek Reginald Bell (born 31 October 1941) is a British racing driver. In sportscar racing, he won the Le Mans 24 hours five times, the Daytona 24 three times and the World Sportscar Championship twice. He also raced in Formula One for the Ferrari, Wheatcroft, McLaren, Surtees and Tecno teams. He has been described by fellow racer Hans-Joachim Stuck as one of the most liked drivers of his generation.

==Early career==

Bell grew up on a farm and helped to run the Church Farm caravan site, complete with its own pub, near Pagham Harbour, boarding at The King&#x27;s School, Worcester. He was encouraged by his stepfather Bernard Hender to take up racing with a Lotus Seven in 1964. He won his first race in the Lotus at Goodwood in March of that year. He graduated to Formula Three in the following year racing a Lotus 31 and in 1966 switched to a Lotus 41 scoring his first victory, again at Goodwood. In 1967 he enjoyed seven wins. He entered Formula Two in a privateer Brabham BT23C fielded by his stepfather&#x27;s Church Farm Racing team and after several promising performances, which caught Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s eye, made his Formula One Grand Prix debut for Ferrari at Monza in 1968. He contested the 1969 Tasman Series in a 2.4 Dino and was second at Lakeside to Amon and Rindt at Warwick Farm. In 1969 he raced the four-wheel-drive McLaren M9A in its only ever race at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

Bell took part in the filming of &quot;Le Mans&quot; (1970) starring Steve McQueen, and he and his family lived with the McQueen family during the filming, the two becoming friends. Bell had a lucky escape during the making of the film. The Ferrari 512 he was driving suddenly caught fire whilst getting into position for a take. He managed to get out of the car just before it was engulfed in flames and suffered minor burns. Although the car was badly damaged, it was later rebuilt and is still racing at historic meets.

Bell finished second in the 1970 European Formula Two Championship, driving a Brabham BT30 for Wheatcroft Racing. In 1972 he got a drive in the Tecno Formula One team, along with Nanni Galli. He later raced a number of times for the Surtees team, including a sixth place at the 1970 United States Grand Prix racing a Surtees TS7, which was to be his highest finish in the Formula One World Championship. He had a few further drives for Surtees in 1974 and finished 11th in the 1974 German Grand Prix. Enjoying single seaters more than sports cars he accepted drives in F5000/Libre British Shellsport series and F5000 in 1976-7 the Penske PC7 March and also odd F5000 drives in the US and Australia.

It was to be in sports car racing, which he came to via a drive in Jacques Swaters privately entered Ferrari 512M in the 1970 Spa 1000 km, leading to a Ferrari works drive at the 1970 Le Mans 24 hours, where he built a strong reputation as a world class and world championship winning racer.

==Le Mans==
Bell won the Le Mans 24 hours race five times, in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1987, making him the most successful British driver in the race to date. He was teamed with the Belgian Jacky Ickx in 1975, racing the Gulf Mirage GR8, again in 1981, racing a Porsche 936, and finally in 1982 racing a Rothmans Porsche 956. Bell went on to win the 1986 and 1987 Le Mans teamed with Hans-Joachim Stuck and Al Holbert racing a Rothmans Porsche 962. 

His first Le Mans was in 1970 in a works-entered Ferrari 512, with co-driver Ronnie Peterson, his last in 1996 racing a McLaren F1 GTR. Bell achieved his highest ever speed at Le Mans at the 1971 Le Mans 24 hours April test day, reaching a calculated top speed of 246 mph on the Mulsanne Straight in the JW Gulf Porsche 917LH.

==Sportscar racing==
Bell also won the World Sportscar Championship title twice in 1985 and 1986 and the 24 Hours of Daytona three times in 1986, 1987 and 1989. He won the 1973 Silverstone RAC Tourist Trophy racing a BMW 3.0CSL with Harald Ertl. In 1984 he won the Nürburgring 1000km with Stefan Bellof, racing a Porsche 956, with a notable fourth place in the 1974 Nürburgring 1000km racing a Gulf GR7 with James Hunt on the longer 22.8 km circuit.

His first victory in the Spa 1000km came in 1974 racing a Mirage M6 with Mike Hailwood, going onto win the 1975 and 1984 editions, with Henri Pescarolo, in 1975, in that season&#x27;s dominant Alfa Romeo Tipo 33TT12 on the old 14 km track and with Stefan Bellof, in the equally dominant Porsche 956 of 1984, on the shorter circuit used by Formula One. He is also one of two drivers to win the Spa 1000km on both the original and current circuits, the other being Jacky Ickx.
==Post-racing career==
Bell was hired as chairman for the Spectre R42 super car project between 1996 and its demise in 1997. In 2001 he was hired to consult for the Bentley Speed 8 programme, helping Bentley to win Le Mans two years later. He now splits his time between the United States and his home near Chichester, UK, with his wife Misti. He is an after dinner speaker and motorsport commentator, and also races in historic events, and is a global ambassador for Bentley. Bell is also an operating partner of Bentley Naples in Naples, Florida.

His eldest son Justin Bell is also a racer. The two raced together in the 1991 24 Hours of Daytona, and the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans. Bell was to race in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona with Justin, however the car dropped out of the race early and Derek did not get to run in the race. Aside from winning at Le Mans five times, he claims his proudest moment was coming third with his son Justin racing the Harrods sponsored McLaren F1 GTR in the 1995 Le Mans on Fathers Day.
Bell is a patron for the charities Dementia Support, Hope for Tomorrow, Mission Motorsport and the Henry Surtees Foundation. He is also an Ambassador for the Fly Navy Heritage Trust.

He is currently the president of the oldest pram race in the world. The Pagham Pram Race started in 1946 and is run annually at 11am on Boxing Day.

Bell returned to Le Mans to race a Porsche 962 for the first time in 20 years in the Group C support race at Le Mans on 16 June 2012.

He was presented with Honorary Life membership of the AA in recognition of his 50 years in motorsport, commemorated by a plaque presented by Lord March at the Moving Motorshow during the 2014 Goodwood Festival of Speed in the presence of Chris Jansen, CEO of the AA, and Edmund King, the president of the AA.

Bell was the grand marshal at the 2014 Silverstone 6 Hours, 2010 Twelve Hours of Sebring and 2021 24 hours of Le Mans.

<doc id="1233566" wikidata="Q726694" url="?curid=1233566" title="Neurotic Outsiders">
<text>Neurotic Outsiders was a British-American rock supergroup founded in 1995, consisting of Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, Matt Sorum and Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses, and John Taylor of Duran Duran. The first line-up featured Billy Idol and Steve Stevens, together with McKagan and Sorum, but they were soon replaced by Jones and Taylor. 

Originally a gathering of friends jamming together at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, the band released one eponymous album on Maverick Records in September 1996, and briefly toured Europe and North America. The band broke up in 1997 due to the members&#x27; commitments to other projects, but reunited briefly in April 1999 for three shows at the Viper Room.

== History ==
Neurotic Outsiders was formed when Matt Sorum recruited Steve Jones, Duff McKagan and John Taylor to play at a benefit at the Viper Room in Los Angeles in June 1995. The lineup soon began playing regularly at the venue, while friends of the band made guest appearances onstage, including Billy Idol, Iggy Pop, Chrissie Hynde, Ian Astbury and Mel C. The band was originally named Neurotic Boy Outsiders after an article in The Guardian that Taylor had read in the 1970s, but &quot;Boy&quot; was dropped from the name at the request of Sorum and McKagan. Following growing interest from music executives, the band was signed to Maverick Records and given one million dollars to record an album. 

The band chose Jerry Harrison to produce the album, which was recorded in California during the course of six days. A majority of the album&#x27;s songs were written by Jones, while lead vocals were shared between Jones, Taylor and McKagan. The band&#x27;s self-titled album was released on 10 September 1996. The album was met with little fanfare, while critics deemed the band &quot;pure Hollywood, honestly and comfortably vulgar&quot; and praised their musicianship. The band went on tour in support of the album through Europe and North America, but ceased to exist due to Jones participating in the Sex Pistols&#x27; reunion and McKagan focusing on Guns N&#x27; Roses. Their final release was the EP &quot;Angelina&quot; in 1997. Neurotic Outsiders reunited in 1999 for three shows at the Viper Room.

<text>Twins (rendered in its title sequence logo as TWiiNS) is a 1988 American buddy comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman. The film is about unlikely fraternal twin brothers (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito) who were separated at birth. The core of the film is the contrast between the streetwise Vincent (DeVito) and the intelligent but naive Julius (Schwarzenegger).

The film was a commercial success, grossing $216 million worldwide. Instead of taking their usual salaries for the film, Schwarzenegger, DeVito and Reitman agreed with the studio to take collectively 40% of the film&#x27;s box office and rental returns; this resulted in them receiving the biggest paychecks of their film careers.

==Plot ==
In 1953, Julius and Vincent Benedict are twin brothers, the result of a secret experiment carried out at a genetics laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico to combine the DNA of six fathers to produce the perfect child with Maryanne Benedict, who is selected to be their mother. To the surprise of the scientists, two fraternal embryos formed and the non-identical twins were born.

Vincent was placed in an orphanage run by nuns in Los Angeles and believed his mother abandoned him. With no one but himself to rely on, Vincent seduced a nun, escaped from the orphanage, and later became an indebted, small time criminal. Vincent owes money to a loan shark and makes a living stealing cars and selling them for parts. Julius was raised on a South Pacific island by Professor Werner, one of the scientists from the experiment, who put him through intense physical training and extensive study. Both believed Mary Ann died during childbirth.

In 1988, each twin is unaware of the other&#x27;s existence. On Julius&#x27; 35th birthday, Werner finally tells Julius about Vincent. With Werner&#x27;s blessing, Julius proceeds to Los Angeles to find his brother. Julius eventually tracks Vincent down in jail, where he is being held for unpaid parking tickets and driving with an expired license.

Julius bails Vincent out, but Vincent does not believe his story and abandons him in a parking lot. Julius pursues Vincent to his workplace and finds him being beaten up by Morris Klane, one of three loan shark brothers that Vincent owes $20,000. Julius subdues Morris, earning Vincent&#x27;s trust and respect. He later meets Vincent&#x27;s girlfriend Linda Mason and enters a romantic relationship with her sister Marnie.

Over dinner, Vincent shows Julius a document he stole from the orphanage that shows their mother is still alive, but believing that she abandoned him at birth, Vincent shows no interest in finding her. Believing that their mother may have also been lied to, Julius tracks one of their six fathers to the address on the document. The father directs Julius to Dr. Mitchell Traven, Werner&#x27;s colleague, in New Mexico.

Vincent steals a car from a parking garage and finds a prototype fuel injector in the trunk that was to be delivered to industrialist Beetroot McKinley in Houston, in return for $5 million. Vincent decides to pose as the delivery man, Mr. Webster, and deliver the fuel injector himself so he can collect the money and pay off his debts. He reluctantly allows Julius, Linda and Marnie to accompany him to New Mexico to find Traven, while Webster begins pursuing Vincent. In the process, he encounters the Klane brothers and shoots them in the legs as a warning to keep away from Vincent.

In New Mexico, Traven reveals the truth to the twins, pointing out that Julius resulted from the &quot;best&quot; genes, and spitefully denouncing Vincent as having come from the &quot;leftover crap&quot;, leaving Vincent distraught. After Julius threatens him, Traven directs them to Santa Fe, where their mother lives in an art colony. Julius convinces Vincent to regain his spirits and they continue their journey.

On the way to Santa Fe, the twins are accosted by the Klane brothers, but they fight them off for the last time. At the art colony in Santa Fe, a gardener informs Julius and Vincent that their mother has died. They leave, unaware that the gardener was in fact Mary Ann herself, who did not believe their story, having been told she only had one son who died at birth.

Abandoning Julius and the girls in New Mexico, Vincent heads to Houston alone to deliver the prototype to Beetroot. Julius chases after Vincent, sensing his whereabouts thanks to twin telepathy, and finds him seconds after the exchange with Beetroot. Webster appears and kills Beetroot and his bodyguard, demanding the money from Vincent. Julius intercepts Webster, allowing Vincent to escape, but Vincent returns and agrees to give Webster the money to save Julius. Webster decides to kill them anyway for seeing his face, but Vincent, at Julius&#x27; subtle prompting, kills him by dropping a heavy chain onto him and burying him.

Julius and Vincent return both the prototype and $4 million (with Vincent skimming $1 million) and use a $50,000 reward to pay off Vincent&#x27;s debts and start a consulting firm. Their publicity reaches the art colony, and Mary Ann learns that her sons are alive. She violently confronts Traven for concealing the truth and then tracks Julius and Vincent down to their workplace, where they share a warm reunion.

Sometime later, Julius and Vincent marry Marnie and Linda. Each marriage produces a set of twins: Jude and Mare, and Vinnie and Linnie, and the couples are last seen meeting their mother and Professor Werner on an outing.

==Cast==
==Production==
The original music score was composed by Georges Delerue and Randy Edelman. Edelman has scored three more films for director Ivan Reitman (&quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;; &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;; and &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot;) whereas this was Delerue&#x27;s only work for him.

Notably, this was Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s first time starring in a major comedy. Because Universal Pictures viewed this as a significant risk compared with having Schwarzenegger make another profitable action film, Schwarzenegger voluntarily took no salary in exchange for a share of the film&#x27;s profits. Co-star Danny DeVito and director Reitman made similar deals. When the film was a major financial success – box office of $216 million against an $18 million production budget – the three together earned a significant share of the overall profits. In a 2016 interview with Graham Bensinger, Schwarzenegger stated that the decision to &quot;invest in myself&quot; by trying comedy and forgoing the salary in exchange for a share of the film&#x27;s profits was one of the best decisions of his entire life.

===Filming===
Many of the outdoor scenes were filmed in northern New Mexico. Locations and backgrounds included the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge near Taos, the San Francisco de Asis Mission Church in Ranchos de Taos, St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe and buildings in Los Alamos.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a commercial success, opening as the number one film in the United States earning $11 million on its opening weekend. It retained the top spot for the next two weekends and went on to gross $112 million domestically, being the fifth biggest grossing film in the United States released in 1988. The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 17, 1989, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend. It grossed $216 million worldwide.

Following the film&#x27;s success, Reitman and Schwarzenegger teamed up again for &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) and then again for &quot;Junior&quot; (1994), which also starred DeVito.

===Critical response===
&quot;Twins&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release. 
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 42% approval rating based on 43 reviews, with an average score of . The consensus states: &quot;Though it offers a few modest pleasures for undemanding viewers, &quot;Twins&quot; leans too heavily on the wackiness of its premise to overcome its narrative shortcomings.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 53 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;engaging entertainment with some big laughs and a sort of warm goofiness&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review: &quot;In &quot;Twins&quot;, which is supposed to be funny, the former Mr. Universe and pint-sized Danny DeVito play twins, the result of a genetic experiment that went awry. To the extent that &quot;Twins&quot; is carried by anybody, it is carried by Mr. DeVito. Mr. Schwarzenegger is dead weight.&quot;

==Cancelled sequel==
In March 2012, Universal announced the development of a sequel titled &quot;Triplets&quot; with Schwarzenegger and DeVito due to return with Eddie Murphy as their long lost triplet brother. Reitman was set to co produce.

In April 2015, it was announced that plans for the film were put on hold. In March 2018, Schwarzenegger confirmed that the script for &quot;Triplets&quot; was finished and that Murphy was officially attached to the film. Schwarzenegger briefly discussed how Murphy&#x27;s character became the triplet brother of his and DeVito&#x27;s characters saying &quot;funny thing that happens in the mixing of the sperm&quot;. It was unknown if Reitman would still be involved in the film, as originally announced in 2012.

In September 2021, it was announced filming will commence in January 2022 in Boston, with Ivan Reitman directing, Schwarzenegger and DeVito reprising their roles as Julius and Vincent Benedict, and Tracy Morgan replacing Eddie Murphy as Schwarzenegger and DeVito&#x27;s long lost triplet brother. However, Reitman died in February 2022, leaving the status of the film unclear. In May 2023, Schwarzenegger confirmed that a sequel would not be made, as Reitman&#x27;s son Jason put the idea to an end following his father&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1233582" wikidata="Q498974" url="?curid=1233582" title="Bojang of Goguryeo">
<text>Bojang (died 682; ) was the 28th and last monarch of Goguryeo the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was placed on the throne by the military leader Yeon Gaesomun. His reign ended when Goguryeo fell to the allied forces of the southern Korean kingdom of Silla and the Chinese Tang dynasty.

== Background ==
The period of his rule over Goguryeo is recounted in the final two books of the annals of Goguryeo in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. Bojang&#x27;s given name was Jang, though he was also known as Bojang. Bojang was the nephew of the previous king, king Yeongnyu and son of Go Dae-Yang. In 642, the general Yeon Gaesomun carried out a coup d&#x27;etat and killed Yeongnyu and many of his supporters. Bojang was then placed on the throne.

With the aim of inducing Goguryeo to join an expedition against Baekje, Silla dispatched Kim Chun-chu to request the commitment of troops but Goguryeo did not consent.

For most of his reign, Bojang was a puppet, giving a veneer of legitimacy to Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s military rule. For example, at Yeon&#x27;s instigation he supported Taoism and issued edicts repressing Buddhism in the country, which had formerly been officially Buddhist.

Goguryeo experienced many natural disasters during his reign.

== Reign ==
Goguryeo continued battle against the southern Korean kingdom of Silla, in alliance with the third of the Three Kingdoms, Baekje. Silla was further isolated by Goguryeo&#x27;s restored relations with the Wa of Japan. In 642, Silla sent Kim Chun-chu to negotiate a treaty, but when Yeon Gaesomun demanded the return of the Seoul region, talks broke down, leading Silla to eventually ally with the Tang dynasty.

In 645, the Emperor Taizong of Tang led a major expedition against Goguryeo by land and sea, but Yeon Gaesomun and Yang Manchun repelled the invasion, as well as subsequent smaller attacks by the Tang. In 654, Goguryeo attacked the Khitans, who were allied with the Tang. In 655, Goguryeo and Baekje attacked Silla.

The Baekje kingdom finally fell to Silla-Tang in 660. Yeon Gaesomun defeated major invasions of Pyongyang in 661 and Sasu River in 662, but Silla and Tang were now free to focus and intensify their attacks against Goguryeo. In 663, the Baekje revival movement ended as its leader Buyeo Pung retreated to Goguryeo.

After the death of Yeon Gaesomun in 666, Bojang was unable to gain control over the country, which instead was wracked by a succession struggle between Yeon&#x27;s sons.

== Fall of Goguryeo and after ==
As internal struggles continued in Goguryeo, Yeon Namsaeng defected and 40 castles near the border surrendered to the Tang, while Yeon Jeong-to, Yeon Gaesomun&#x27;s brother, defected to Silla.

The Goguryeo capital fell to Silla-Tang forces in the ninth lunar month of 668, and King Bojang was captured. He was appointed to the minister of public works (工部尚書) by Tang Gaozong.

Tang faced increasing problems ruling the former inhabitants of Goguryeo, as well as Silla&#x27;s resistance to Tang&#x27;s remaining presence on the Korean Peninsula. In 677, the Tang insisted on crowning Bojang as the &quot;King of Joseon&quot; and put him in charge of the Liaodong Commandery () of the Protectorate General to Pacify the East.

However, Bojang continued to foment rebellions against Tang in an attempt to revive Goguryeo, organizing Goguryeo refugees and allying with the Malgal tribes. He was eventually banished to Sichuan in 681, and died the following year.

Because Bojang was the last ruler of Goguryeo, he did not receive a temple name after his death. There was a brief attempt at Goguryeo restoration made by Anseung, who ultimately surrendered to Silla.

One of his sons Go Yak-gwang settled in Japan in 666 where he founded the Koma clan and became known as Koma no Koshiki Jakkō.

Go Deokmu was a prince of Goguryeo and founded Lesser Goguryeo. He was the third son of King Bojang.

<text>The Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence (PACE) is a United States–based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that promotes high school quiz bowl and runs the National Scholastic Championship (NSC), an end-of-year national tournament for high school quiz bowl teams. PACE was founded in 1996 by a group of quiz bowl players and coaches who were dissatisfied with the quality of high school quiz bowl at the time. The NSC has been run in the June of every year since 1998. Beyond running the NSC, PACE offers advice and staff assistance to high schools and colleges who run high school quiz bowl tournaments. PACE does not currently supply questions for regular season tournaments or offer a collegiate competition program, unlike NAQT or Questions Unlimited.

In addition to running a national tournament, PACE awards the Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award each year at the opening ceremony of the NSC. The award is chosen by PACE members to honor &quot;a high school academic competition team member, advisor, or organization whose character best promotes the spirit and honor of quiz bowl competition&quot;. It is named for Ben Cooper, who, as the captain of the It&#x27;s Academic quiz bowl team at Georgetown Day School, worked with the PACE founders to provide a player&#x27;s perspective on the plans for the inaugural NSC. Ben Cooper died in an automobile accident just before the start of his senior year. In 2004, PACE expanded its recognition program to include a &quot;Young Ambassador&quot; Award to recognize individuals or recent alumni from high school or college quiz bowl programs for &quot;valuable and significant contributions to the high school academic competition community&quot;.

==National Scholastic Championship==
PACE runs the National Scholastic Championship, a tournament for high school quiz bowl teams. Teams that attend the PACE NSC are mainly from schools in the United States, with teams from Canada and Singapore having also attended. Teams qualify by placing well at a PACE-certified tournament. There are three levels of qualifier events, with higher levels allowing more teams to qualify from that event. A number of teams can also qualify via a wild card bid. There is no limit to the number of teams from a single school that can qualify or attend. In order to qualify multiple teams from one school, multiple teams must concurrently qualify at the same tournament.

On March 18, 2020, PACE announced that the 2020 NSC would be cancelled due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
===Format===

The tournament takes place over two days during the weekend. On Saturday, teams are grouped into pools for preliminary rounds and play a round robin within that group, then are regrouped for playoff rounds based on their win–loss record in their preliminary group. On Sunday, teams are again regrouped into &quot;superplayoff&quot; brackets. Usually, a final will be played between the top two teams, though specific circumstances can make a final match unnecessary. Following the final rounds, an All-Star game featuring the top individual scorers is played and the closing ceremony is held.

Each round consists of two halves of ten tossups and ten bonuses. Tossups are worth 10 points for a correct answer, though 20 points may be awarded if they are answered early. Teams are not penalized for incorrect answers. Bouncebacks were allowed for bonuses until 2023. In the event of a tie, a sudden death tossup is read.

From 1998 to 2009, the NSC used a slightly different gameplay format that was distinct from most other quiz bowl tournaments. The old format had three rounds with varying gameplay, the Related Tossup-Bonus round, the Category Quiz round, and the Stretch round.

===NSC results and Cooper award recipients===
====Notes====
==Other ventures==
In March 2009, PACE organized the second annual &quot;The Weekend of Quizbowl&quot;, a regular season invitational tournament at George Mason University that drew teams from across the United States. Part of the tournament ran on a custom question packets set that was also sold to other invitational tournaments. PACE did not run the tournament the following year. In 2014, PACE created an outreach fund to give monetary grants of up to 200 to high school quiz bowl teams.

<text>Eddie Johnson (February 10, 1919 – June 30, 1974) was an American race car driver.

Born in Richmond, Virginia, Johnson grew up in Los Angeles, where he was a high school acquaintance of 1950 Indianapolis 500 winner Johnnie Parsons. He drove in the AAA and USAC Championship Car series, racing in the 1950–1952 and 1955–1966 seasons with 33 starts, including the Indianapolis 500 races in all of those years but the first two. He finished in the top ten 9 times, with his best finish in 3rd position, in 1959 at Trenton. Late in his career, Johnson frequently came to Indianapolis without an assigned car only to be signed on to a team which needed a driver to put a struggling car in the race. In 1965, Johnson became the last person on the track in the Indianapolis 500 mile race with a naturally aspirated Offenhauser in a roadster. Johnson was flagged to finish in 10th place.

Johnson died in a plane crash near Cleveland, Ohio. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled the probable cause was pilot error, specifically attempting to fly visually in unsuitable weather and structurally overloading the airplane.

==Indianapolis 500 results==


* shared drive with Jim Rathmann
** shared drive with Rodger Ward

*During his Indy career, Eddie Johnson drove 4,825 miles without leading a lap. Only Chet Miller and Dick Simon completed more laps at Indianapolis without leading a lap.

==World Championship career summary==
The Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Eddie Johnson participated in 9 World Championship races and scored 1 World Championship point.

<doc id="1233589" wikidata="Q835489" url="?curid=1233589" title="Tsz Wan Shan">
<text>Tsz Wan Shan () is a residential area in Kowloon, Hong Kong. Located below Temple Hill, it is administratively part of Wong Tai Sin District. Temple Hill is also called &quot;Tsz Wan Shan&quot; , but Tsz Wan Shan usually refers to the area.

It is a densely populated residential area, consisting of several large public housing estates. The old Tsz Wan Shan housing blocks (64 buildings in total) were demolished between late 1980s and mid 1990s.
==Features==
Po Kong Village Road Park is located at 140 Po Kong Village Road. There are elevated cycling track (about 1 kilometre in length), cycling area and skater park. Three vertical rams of different difficulty levels are constructed for co-use by players of extreme sports, namely freestyle BMX, skateboarding and aggressive inline skating.

In the very north of the district, a steep path leads to a Kwun Yam temple. The path goes to Temple Hill, part of the Ma On Shan Country Park and then joins the MacLehose Trail and the Wilson Trail, reaching across the New Territories.

==Education==

The first school village in Hong Kong was established in 2002 at Po Kong Village Road, Tsz Wan Shan. It is the only school village in Hong Kong. There are five schools including International Christian Quality Music Secondary and Primary School, Tsz Wan Shan Catholic Primary School, Po Leung Kuk Grandmont Primary School, St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Primary School (Po Kong Village Road) and Po Leung Kuk Celine Ho Yam Tong College.

Tsz Wan Shan is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 45. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money); no government primary schools are in this net.

==Transport==
Buses: No. 2F, 3B, 3C, 3D, 5C, 15A, 116. Specific time services for 3X, 5P, 5X, 302, 302A, A23, E23 &amp; E23A.

Minibuses (Scheduled Services / Green Minibus): No. 18M, 19, 19M, 19S, 20, 37A, 37M, 66S (Night services only), 73.

Minibuses (Red Public Light Buses): From Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan, and Jordan Road. Specific time services from Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, North Point, and Castle Peak Road, Kowloon.

Due to the height and the steep inclination of the mountain, there are no railway connections at Tsz Wan Shan. In February 2008, during a site inspection for the Sha Tin to Central Link, the then Secretary for Transport and Housing, Eva Cheng, said the hilly terrain and geological conditions in Tsz Wan Shan made it technically difficult and risky to build a station in this location, despite strong requests from Wong Tai Sin District Council and many local residents.

<doc id="1233595" wikidata="Q1893929" url="?curid=1233595" title="Ink Flag">
<text>The Ink Flag (, &quot;Degel HaDyo&quot;) was a handmade Israeli flag raised in March 1949 during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War to mark the capture of Umm Rashrash. The flag’s display in what later became the city of Eilat was replaced two hours later by an official flag when the Golani Brigade arrived. The raising of the Ink Flag is considered to be the end of the war and the birth of Israel.

==History==
On 5 March 1949, Israel launched Operation Uvda, the last military maneuver of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On 10 March, the Israeli Defense Forces reached the shores of the Red Sea at Umm Rashrash, west of Aqaba in the area of biblical Elath, and captured it without a battle. The Negev Brigade and Golani Brigade took part in the operation. A makeshift flag created from a white sheet inscribed with ink was raised by Captain (later General) Avraham Adan, company commander of the 8th Battalion of the Negev Brigade.

The improvised flag was made on the order of Negev Brigade commander Nahum Sarig, when it was discovered that the brigade did not have an Israeli flag on hand. The soldiers found a sheet, drew two ink stripes, and sewed on a Star of David torn off a first-aid kit.

In Eilat, a bronze sculpture by Israeli sculptor Daniel Kafri commemorates the event, unveiled on 28 February 1996. This historical place was already declared a National Heritage Site on 19 January 1994. The photo of the raising of the Ink Flag, taken by the soldier Micha Perry, bears resemblance to the 1945 American photo &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;.

<doc id="1233601" wikidata="Q17051976" url="?curid=1233601" title="Rosier (demon)">
<text>Rosier, according to the occultist Gustav Davidson in &quot;A Dictionary Of Angels&quot; (1967) is &quot;a former lesser-rank angel of the order of dominations.&quot;, the cited source being Sebastien Michaelis&#x27; &quot;Admirable History of the Possession and Conversion of a Penitent Woman&quot; (1613).

&quot;Admirable History of the Possession and Conversion of a Penitent Woman&quot; is in public domain. Rosier exists on page 325 and is described as &quot;the second in order of Dominations, and by his sweet and sugared words, he tempteth men to fall in love. His adversary in heaven is Basil, who would not listen to amorous and inchanting language.&quot;.

Rosier does not appear in the &quot;Bible&quot; or &quot;Apocrypha&quot;, and is not mentioned in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; or &quot;Britannica&quot;, but following Davidson&#x27;s work of 1967. Rosier has been picked up in other occult books and in some popular culture.

==In popular culture==
* Rosier features in the novel &quot;Mr Mee&quot; (2000) by Andrew Crumey, as creator of an esoteric work titled &quot;Rosier&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;. Crumey&#x27;s subsequent novels &quot;Mobius Dick&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Secret Knowledge&quot; (2013) feature the Rosier Corporation, which is responsible for sinister experiments using quantum computers. &quot;The Secret Knowledge&quot; includes other characters with surnames from the Michaelis&#x27; classification of demons, e.g. Verrier, Carreau, Verrine and Oeillet.
* One of the main characters of Kaori Yuki&#x27;s manga &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; is called Rosiel (also spelled Rociel, ロシエル in the original), and is named after the fallen angel (as stated by the author in a side note to volume 1). The different desinence is due to the uniformity of the [l] and [r] sounds in Japanese. However, there are other ideas as to why the name is spelled with an &quot;l&quot; rather than an &quot;r&quot;.

<doc id="1233605" wikidata="Q2870553" url="?curid=1233605" title="Iron Sunrise">
<text>Iron Sunrise is a 2004 hard science fiction novel by British writer Charles Stross, which follows the events in &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;. The book was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 2005.

&quot;Singularity Sky&quot; depicts a future where human societies have been involuntarily taken from Earth and widely distributed across the Milky Way galaxy, seemingly at random, in the wake of a technological singularity which has led to the onset of strong AI, in the form of the &quot;Eschaton&quot;.

The events in both novels take place consecutively some time after the immediate aftermath of the singularity.

==Background==
==Plot summary==

Martin Springfield and Rachel Mansour return to Earth to recuperate following the events of &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;. However, Rachel is quickly called upon to explain the administrative expenses she incurred during her previous assignment. Shortly thereafter she finds herself negotiating with a lunatic believing himself to be a reincarnation of Idi Amin and in possession of an armed nuclear device which, in the black humor typical of the series, he has threatened to detonate after receiving an eviction notice from his apartment.

Meanwhile, a young and hopeful planetary civilization is murdered by the apparent use of a causality violation device which causes their sun to explode without warning (the &quot;iron sunrise&quot; of the title), and their defense systems to deploy automatically against the homeworld of the suspected perpetrators of the atrocity.

Rachel and Martin set off to investigate these events and prevent the assassination of the remaining members of the murdered civilization&#x27;s leaders, who can abort the retaliation strike. In the background the Eschaton continues to play its own game.

<text>Hans Fischer (; 27 July 1881 – 31 March 1945) was a German organic chemist and the recipient of the 1930 Nobel Prize for Chemistry &quot;for his researches into the constitution of haemin and chlorophyll and especially for his synthesis of haemin.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Fischer was born on July 27, 1881, in Höchst, now a city district of Frankfurt located in Germany. His parents were Dr. Eugen Fischer, Director of the firm of , Wiesbaden, and Privatdozent at the Technical High School, Stuttgart, and Anna Herdegen was his mother. He went to a primary school in Stuttgart, and later to the &quot;Humanistisches Gymnasium&quot; in Wiesbaden, matriculating in 1899. He read chemistry and medicine, first at the University of Lausanne and then at Marburg. He graduated in 1904 obtaining his chemistry degree, 2 years later in 1906 he licensed for medicine and in 1908 he qualified for his M.D. which he applied to the University of Munich.

===Career===
He worked first at a Medical Clinic in Munich and then at the First Berlin Chemical Institute under Emil Fischer. He returned to Munich in 1911 and qualified as lecturer on internal medicine one year later. In 1913, he became a lecturer in physiology at the Physiological Institute in Munich. In 1916, he became Professor of Medical Chemistry at the University of Innsbruck and from there he went to the University of Vienna in 1918.

From 1921 until his death, he held the position of Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Technical University of Munich.

Fischer&#x27;s scientific work was mostly concerned with the investigation of the pigments in blood, bile, and also chlorophyll in leaves, as well as with the chemistry of pyrrole from which these pigments are derived. Of special importance was his synthesis of bilirubin and haemin. He received many honors for this work, and received the Nobel Prize in 1930. The lunar crater Fischer was named after him (and Hermann Emil Fischer) in 1976. Hans Fisher had mapped the composition of a hem group. In 1929 Fischer succeeded in producing the substance and proving that its ring has a central atom of iron, as he also continued studying other pigmented substances of a biological importance of biochemistry such as chlorophyll, the color that plays part in a plants photosynthesis. Fischer also unraveled the bile pigments biliverdin (which causes the yellowish color characteristic of bruised skin) and bilirubin (which yellows skin in jaundice cases), and synthesized them in 1942 and 1944, successively. He conducted microanalyses of more than 60,000 chemical substance, and had won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1930. The person that sparked Fischer&#x27;s interest was von Muller, his former professor and supervisor whom interests were in pyrrole pigments by inviting Fischer to work with him at the well-known Second Medical Clinic in Munich in 1910. Under Muller, he began to examine the composition of the bile pigment bilirubin, something he would continue to be engaged in during the decades that followed. Fischer&#x27;s succession also came with difficulty&#x27;s as many of his experiments seemed to have failed but with time Fischer was able to perfect his acknowledgement with his failed attempts.

===Personal life===
Fischer married Wiltrud Haufe around his 50&#x27;s in the year 1935. Fischer was a man who was dedicated almost &quot;exclusively&quot; to his work. He continued his scientific research during Germany&#x27;s Nazi era, and committed suicide on Easter Sunday in 1945, after his laboratory and life&#x27;s work had been destroyed by the bombing in the last days of World War II.

<text>Hackney Central is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground, located in the London Borough of Hackney. It lies between and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station and the trains serving it are operated by Transport for London. 

The station is connected to Hackney Downs station on the Weaver line of the Overground by a direct passenger walkway linking the two stations (replacing an earlier such link) that was opened in July 2015. This walkway means passengers do not have to exit on to the street in order to continue their onward journey and has eased congestion.

==History==
===Early years===

The North London Railway opened a station named &quot;Hackney&quot; on 26 September 1850, to the east of Mare Street, then in the county of Middlesex. It closed on 1 December 1870 and was replaced the same day by a station to the west of Mare Street, designed by Edwin Henry Horne and also named &quot;Hackney&quot;. This station passed in due course to the London and North Western Railway and later on to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which closed the entire North London line east of Dalston Junction to passenger traffic in 1944.

Just to the west of the station a goods yard called Graham Road was opened by the Great Eastern Railway in 1894. Located just west of the GER Hackney Downs railway viaduct the depot consisted of seven sidings dealing with coal and general goods. The land had originally been purchased for a rail link between the North London and Great Eastern Railways.

Graham Road goods yard closed in October 1965. The site was finally used to link the North London and Great Eastern lines when in anticipation of the closure of Broad Street railway station in 1985 the &quot;Graham Road Curve&quot; was opened to traffic.

===Reopening===
On 12 May 1980, the station was reopened by British Rail as part of the Crosstown Linkline service, this time named &quot;Hackney Central&quot;, a little to the west of the 1870 station. The 1870 station building designed by Edwin Henry Horne is no longer in use by the railway, but is one of only two examples of North London Railway architecture still &quot;in situ&quot;, the other being Camden Road station, which is still open. Access to the modern Hackney Central station is from an alleyway adjacent to the 1870 building on Mare Street, as well as a more direct access from Amhurst Road. 

The former station building is now a bar and music venue.

===Line improvement===
As part of the programme to introduce four-car trains on the London Overground network, the North London line between and closed in February 2010 to enable the installation of a new signalling system and the extension of platforms across the network. The line reopened on 1 June 2010, initially with a reduced service and none on Sundays. The full seven-day service resumed on 22 May 2011, with extra services running all day in place of the additional shuttle trains which had previously run between Camden Road and Stratford stations in the morning and evening peaks.

===Opening of second entrance===
A new entrance from the south in Graham Road with ticket office and footbridge was opened in 2022.

==Services==


The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
*4 tph westbound to via , and 
*4 tph westbound to Clapham Junction
*8 tph eastbound to 

==Future proposals==

===Crossrail 2===
Hackney Central is a proposed stop on Crossrail 2. It would be between Angel and Tottenham Hale or Seven Sisters. The platforms would be underground, with a connection to the existing surface station.

===Docklands Light Railway===
In February 2006 the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Horizon 2020 report, had suggested that the DLR be extended here from Bow Church via Old Ford and Homerton, taking over the old parts of the North London line to link up Poplar and Canary Wharf. However, most of the former North London line between Hackney Wick and Bow Church has been built on. .

==Connections==
London Bus routes 30, 38, 55, 106, 236, 242, 253, 254, 276, 277, 394 and W15 and night routes N38, N55, N242, N253 and N277 serve the station.

<text>Bombay mix is an Indian snack mix which consists of a variable mixture of spicy dried ingredients, such as sev, fried lentils, peanuts, chickpeas, chickpea flour ganthiya, corn, vegetable oil, puffed rice, fried onion and curry leaves. This is all flavored with salt and a blend of spices that may include coriander and mustard seeds. It is part of a category of snack food called Farsan.

==Variations==
Alternative, regional versions include:

* In Malaysia and Singapore, it is known as &quot;kacang putih&quot;. Members of the local Indian community usually refer to it as &quot;mixture&quot; as is done in southern India. It is available from roadside vendors as well as shops and restaurants. Singaporean supermarket FairPrice refer to their Bombay mix as &quot;murukku&quot;, which is an entirely different product.
* In southern Indian states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as well as in the north of Sri Lanka, it is known as just &quot;mixture&quot;, and is available in almost all the sweet shops and bakeries. Usually, it consists of fried peanuts, &quot;thenkuzhal&quot;, &quot;kara boondhi&quot;, roasted &quot;chana dal&quot;, &quot;karasev&quot;, &quot;murukku&quot; broken into small pieces, &quot;pakoda&quot; and &quot;oma podi&quot;.

<text>Gabriel-Alphonse Desjardins (; November 5, 1854 – October 31, 1920), born in Levis, Canada East was the co-founder of the &quot;Caisses Populaires Desjardins&quot; (today Desjardins Group), a forerunner of North American credit unions and community banks. For his contribution to the advancement of agriculture in the province of Quebec, he was posthumously inducted to the Agricultural Hall of Fame of Quebec in 1994.

== Early life ==
Gabriel-Alphonse Desjardins was a journalist at &quot;L&#x27;écho&quot; and &quot;Le Canadien&quot; until 1879. He was publisher of &quot;Débats de la législature du Québec&quot; from 1879 to 1890, and French-language parliamentary stenographer at the House of Commons of Canada from 1892 to 1917.

== Start of caisses populaires ==

In 1897 Desjardins became increasingly concerned with the problem of usury and undertook three years of careful research and correspondence with the founders of cooperative savings and credit movements in Europe. On December 6, 1900, Desjardins and his wife, Dorimène Roy Desjardins, co-founded the first &quot;Caisse d&#x27;épargne Desjardins&quot; in Lévis and opened for business the following month. Later renamed &quot;Caisses populaires Desjardins&quot; (and today Desjardins Group), the organization was a forerunner of current North American credit unions.

Caisse populaire is a synthesis of four popular savings and credit systems established in Germany, Italy and France: the Schulze-Delitzsch banks and Raiffeisen credit co-operatives (both later integrated into the German Cooperative Financial Group), the Luzzatti popular banks, and the caisses d&#x27;épargne. Desjardins stayed in close contact with many of the founders of the European co-operative movement throughout his life.

From 1900 to 1906, Desjardins founded just three other caisses populaires: Lauzon (1902), Hull (1903), and Saint-Malo, Québec (1905). After failing to get a federal law passed in Ottawa that would provide a Canadian-wide framework for more such organizations, Desjardins turned his efforts, with the collaboration of journalists and priests, to founding more caisses. During the 1907-1914 period, Desjardins personally founded 146 caisses.

At the time of his death in 1920, there were 187 caisses populaires in Québec (30,000 members and total assets of nearly $6 million), 24 in Ontario and 9 in the United States.

Alphonse and Dorimène Desjardins&#x27; home, where the first caisse populaire was launched, is now a center dedicated to his memory and has been visited by over 178,000 people from 115 countries since its opening in 1982.

<text>Recovering the Satellites is the second studio album by American rock band Counting Crows, released on October 15, 1996, in the United States. Released three years after their debut album (and two years of worldwide touring), it reached No. 1 in the United States and was a top seller in Australia, Canada, and the UK as well. The album featured founding Counting Crows members Adam Duritz, David Bryson (guitar), Charlie Gillingham (keyboards), Matt Malley (bass), as well as new additions Ben Mize (drums) and Dan Vickrey (guitars). Multi-instrumentalist David Immerglück played on the album as a session musician as well. Counting Crows brought in producer Gil Norton for &quot;Recovering the Satellites.&quot; (The track &quot;Miller&#x27;s Angels&quot; was produced by Marvin Etzioni.) Three singles were released from the album, with &quot;A Long December&quot; being the best charting, reaching number 6 on the US Radio Songs chart and number 1 in Canada. The album itself peaked on the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200 album chart and has been certified double-platinum in both the US and Canada.

==Recording and release==
As with their debut album &quot;August and Everything After&quot;, the band recorded this album by renting a large house and using the acoustics of that space for unique sounds.

Vocalist Adam Duritz recorded two songs on piano with friends of his in Soul Rebels Brass Band that he could not figure out how to sequence with the rest of this album. &quot;Chelsea&quot; would end up being a bonus track on &quot;Across a Wire: Live in New York City&quot; and &quot;Good Luck&quot; was presumed lost for several years, until in the early 2020s, HBO contacted Geffen Records to make a documentary on the band and they found the original masters of these recordings as well as video performances.

==Reception==

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anthony DeCurtis gave the album four out of five stars. He said that the band&#x27;s second album develops the sounds of &quot;August and Everything After&quot; and that they &quot;largely achieve their serious ambitions&quot;. He praised Adam Duritz&#x27;s lyrics and called the album &quot;deeply satisfying&quot;. Andy Gill from &quot;The Independent&quot; gave the album a more negative review. He criticized Duritz&#x27;s song-writing as &quot;self-pity[ing]&quot; and called him a &quot;classic solipsistic soul-barer, he just won&#x27;t shut up about himself&quot;. He called the album &quot;bland&quot; with &quot;obvious&quot; influences (including R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen and Lynyrd Skynyrd). Gill had some praise for producer Gil Norton&#x27;s work on the album.

In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker also had negative feelings about the album, and gave it a &quot;C&quot; grade. He criticized Duritz&#x27;s &quot;yowling&quot; and &quot;moans&quot; and called Counting Crows a &quot;pastiche of its influences&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concluded that &quot;there are precious few of the killer pop hooks that made such songs as &#x27;Mr. Jones&#x27; and &#x27;″Round Here&#x27; irresistible despite their lack of originality.&quot;

In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album a &quot;self-consciously challenging response&quot; to their successful debut album. He described the songs as &quot;slightly more somber&quot; than those on the first album but &quot;more affecting&quot;. He noted an occasional &quot;pretentiousness&quot; on the album but praised &quot;A Long December&quot; as particularly articulate.

<text>Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang (died 822) was the leader of an aristocratic rebellion in early ninth-century Unified Silla. He was a seventh-generation descendant of King Muyeol, and thus bore the &quot;true bone&quot; status in the Silla bone rank system. His activities are probably linked to strife between different lineages of the Silla royal house.

==Biography==
Kim&#x27;s father, Kim Chuwŏn, was first in line to take the Silla throne after the death of King Seondeok. However, Kim Kyŏngsin seized power by military force and became King Wonseong. Kim Chuwŏn fled to the province of Myeongju, around modern-day Gangneung. These events probably laid the foundation for his son&#x27;s (and grandson&#x27;s) rebellious activities. Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang later became the governor of Ungju (modern-day Gongju) in 821.

After King Aejang was slain by Kim Ŏnsŭng, who then became king, Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang launched a rebellion which rapidly gained control over the modern-day areas of Gwangju, Cheongju, and Gongju. He named his country Jangan (장안, 長安) and took the era name Kyŏngun (경운, 慶雲). The rebellion went on to seize Jeonju, Sangju, Chungju, and Gimhae, thus gaining control over much of the southern and western Korean peninsula. It appears that he was aided by many other members of the Muyeol lineage.

After a month&#x27;s fighting, the royal faction was able to regain much of the territory that Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang&#x27;s forces had taken. With the fall of Ungju imminent, which had been the center of the rebellion, Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang killed himself to avoid capture by the royal army. His loyal followers beheaded his corpse and buried the head and body separately to protect Kim&#x27;s corpse from desecration by the enemy. However, the royalist army was able to find both pieces of Kim&#x27;s corpse after the fall of the city. In the aftermath of his failed rebellion, 239 relatives of Kim Hŏnch&#x27;ang were executed.

Three years later, his son Kim Pŏmmun rekindled the rebellion, but was shortly thereafter also crushed by the royal army.
