<text>The Powder River Basin is a geologic structural basin in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, about east to west and north to south, known for its extensive coal reserves. The former hunting grounds of the Oglala Lakota, the area is very sparsely populated and is known for its rolling grasslands and semiarid climate. 

The basin is both a topographic drainage and geologic structural basin, drained by the Powder River, after which it is named, Cheyenne River, Tongue River, Bighorn River, Little Missouri River, Platte River, and their tributaries. 

The major cities in the area include Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming and Miles City, Montana. 

In 2007, the region produced 436 million short tons (396 million tonnes) of coal, more than twice the production of second-place West Virginia, and more than the entire Appalachian region. The Powder River Basin is the largest coal-producing region in the United States. The region includes the Black Thunder Coal Mine, the most productive in the United States, and North Antelope Rochelle Mine, the second most productive. In recent years, the region has become a major producer of natural gas, both conventional natural gas and coal-bed methane.

== Geologic history ==

The Powder River Basin contains a section of Phanerozoic rocks up to thick, from Cambrian to Holocene.

===Cretaceous===
The thickest section of the Powder River Basin is composed of Cretaceous rocks, an overall regressive sequence of mostly marine shales and sandstones deposited in the Western Interior Seaway.

===Tertiary===
The coal beds of the region began to form about 60 million years ago when the land began rising from a shallow sea. The rise of the Black Hills uplift on the east and the Hartville uplift on the southeast side of the basin created the present outline of the Powder River Basin.

When the coal beds were forming, the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging about of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the basin floor was covered with lakes and swamps. Because of the large area of the swamps, the organic material accumulated into peat bogs instead of being washed into the sea. Periodically the layers of peat were covered with sediments washed in from nearby mountains. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The basin filled with sediment and buried the peat under thousands of feet, compressing the layers of peat and forming coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, leaving the coal seams near the surface.

==Coal==


Powder River Basin (PRB) coal is classified as &quot;sub-bituminous&quot; and contains an average of approximately 8,500 btu/lb, with low sulfur. Contrast this with eastern, Appalachian bituminous coal containing an average of 12,500 btu/lb and high sulfur. PRB coal was essentially worthless until air pollution emissions from power plants (primarily sulfur dioxide, or &quot;SO2&quot;) became a concern. A coal-fired plant designed to burn Appalachian coal must be modified to remove SO2 at a cost estimated in 1999 to be around $322 per ton of SO2. If it switched to burning PRB coal, the cost dropped to $113 per ton of SO2 removed. Removal is accomplished by installing scrubbers.

The Powder River Basin is the largest coal mining region in the US, but most of the coal is buried too deeply to be economically accessible. The Powder River Basin coal beds are shaped like elongated bowls and as mines expand from east to west in the Powder River Basin, they will be going &quot;down the sides of the bowl&quot;. This means that the overburden (rock lying over the coal) will increase as will the stripping ratio (the ratio of rock that needs to be moved).

The United States Geological Survey has conducted a series of studies on the economic accessibility of coal in the major coal-producing regions of the country. The studies typically found that only a small fraction of the coal would be economically accessible at the price then of $10.47/ton. In August 2008, the USGS issued an updated assessment of coal in the Powder River Basin. After considering stripping ratios and production costs, the USGS concluded that at that time, only 6% of the original resource, or 10.1 billion short tons of coal, was economically recoverable. At a price of $60/ton, however, roughly half (48%) of the coal would become economic to produce. Increasing the price paid for coal can increase the amount of economically recoverable coal, but increasing the price of coal also increases its production cost. Because coal is a solid, it cannot be produced from many scattered wells like oil and gas can be. Rather, coal has to be produced from mines that expand slowly by moving massive quantities of overburden.

===Coal mining===
Fifteen mines operate in the Powder River Basin, with most of the active mining taking place in drainages of the Cheyenne River. The US uses about 600 million tons of coal a year, with about 40% of the coal coming from the Powder River Basin. The amount of coal coming from the Powder River Basin has been increasing over the last 20 years.

The mines in the Powder River Basin typically have less than 20 years of life remaining. Almost all of the coal in the Powder River Basin is federally-owned, and further mine expansions will require a series of federal and state approvals, as well as large investments in additional mine equipment to begin the excavations.

The majority of the coal mined in the Powder River Basin is part of the Fort Union Formation (Paleocene), with the low sulfur and ash content of the coal in the region making it very desirable. Coal supplies about one-fifth of the United States&#x27; electricity supplies. The Powder River Basin mines supply approximately 40% of the coal that fuels those stations (mainly east of the Rocky Mountains) for generating electricity.

The mines work in areas where the stripping ratio is between 1:1 (i.e. one ton of rock for one ton of coal) and 3:1. As the mines expand the stripping ratio will increase. As more rock must be moved (using large electrically powered draglines and diesel and electric mining trucks) the production cost will also increase.

The mines are largely non-union operations with a history of squelching labor activity. According to historian Ryan Driskell Tate, surface mining in remote areas happened to reduce some of the &quot;occupational togetherness&quot; typically associated with coal miners working shoulder-to-shoulder underground in Appalachia. The environmental impact of mining on grass and aquifers has been a concern for surrounding ranchers who organized to resist new mines in the 1970s.

==Petroleum==

===Oil and gas===
The Powder River Basin also contains major deposits of petroleum, including the giant Salt Creek Oil Field. The oil and gas are produced from rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Tertiary, but most comes from sandstones in the thick section of Cretaceous rocks.

There is a recent resurgence in oil and gas production as a result of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This resurgence is occurring mainly in the Wyoming portion of the basin, which is historically known as the source of the basin&#x27;s oil. In 2009, a low of 38,000 barrels of oil per day were produced in the basin. That number has risen dramatically to 78,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2014.

The Bell Creek Field is a Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic trap in the Muddy Sandstone. Discovered in 1967 by the Exeter Drilling Co. No. 33-1 Federal-McCarrell well, which found 27 feet of pay at a depth of 4500 ft.

===Coalbed methane===
Recent controversy surrounds the extensive coalbed methane extraction in the region. In the last decade, nearly 7000 such wells have been drilled. An extensive network of gas pipelines connecting these wells has been built, along with a series of pressurization plants, as well as power lines to provide electricity to operate the system. In addition, thousands of miles of new access roads have been constructed.

Extracting the gas requires that water be pumped to the surface to release gas trapped in the coal seam. While some of the water is successfully utilized in agriculture production such as livestock water and crop irrigation, some waters are naturally high in salinity and sodium adsorption ratio. There has been controversy on how to best manage these saline waters.

In 2007, Powder River Basin coalbed field produced 442 billion cubic feet of gas, making the field the 3rd largest source of natural gas in the United States.

==Uranium==
The region also contains major deposits of uranium, contained in sandstones. (See &quot;Uranium mining in Wyoming&quot;). The Wasatch Formation (Eocene) contains the uranium ore &quot;roll front&quot; type deposits found in the Pumpkin Buttes District. Cameco Corporation subsidiary Power Resources Inc. operates uranium mines in the basin.

==Transportation==
In Spring 2005, coal extracted from the mines would retail at the mines for around $5 a ton. However, power stations and plants in the eastern United States were paying over $30 a ton – the difference caused by the cost of transportation. (In October 2008, the mine-mouth price of Powder River Basin coal was closer to $15 per ton.)
To transport coal from the basin, there is a joint railway line owned by the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad running the length of the southern section of the Powder River Basin. A third railroad, the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, faced strong resistance from many parties for its attempts to extend its rail line into the coal mining area, but while the plan was eventually approved by regulating authorities, the project was abandoned after the railroad was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway.

In 2013, five coal export terminals were being proposed in the Pacific Northwest to export coal from the Powder River Basin to Asian markets. As of February 2016, some coal terminal proposals had been withdrawn, leaving two with pending applications. The withdrawals were ascribed to loss of demand and consequent lower coal prices.

===History===
Originally a single track Burlington Northern Railway line built in stages from 1972 to 1979, the rail line ran south from Donkey Creek Junction in the north to Caballo, Wyoming; and then for to Shawnee in Converse County. The Chicago and North Western Railway ran close to the northern section, as did the Union Pacific at Caballo.

In 1982 C&amp;NW and the UP formed Western Railroad Properties, Inc. (WRPI), to acquire half interest in the Burlington Northern coal line from Shawnee Junction to Coal Creek Junction. On December 15, 1986 WPRI purchased more of BN line from Coal Creek Junction to East Caballo Junction. Beginning June 27, 1983 WPRI constructed of new railroad from Shawnee Junction. to Shawnee, rebuilt of C&amp;NW line from Shawnee to Crandall and of new railroad from Crandall to Joyce, Nebraska. The first commercial train ran on August 16, 1984.

By 1985, the line was single track for almost its entire length, and it was handling 19 million tons of coal. The implementation of the second stage of the Clean Air Act (1990) caused demand for clean coal to rise quickly. The C&amp;NW struggled to upgrade capacity to dual track, resulting in numerous failures on the line in 1994, and eventually Union Pacific&#x27;s purchase of C&amp;NW in 1995. The UP spent $855 million over the next five years expanding capacity over its entire network to handle coal shipments from the PRB. By 2005 the Joint Line capacity had grown to handle an all-time record 325 million tons, and was either dual or three track capacity for its entire length.

Due to various trackage and locomotive failures on the Joint Line in late 2004 and early 2005, the line failed to deliver the amount of contracted coal supplies, and electricity rates increased by 15 percent. Coal customers threatened to evaluate alternate sources of energy and transportation, including the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation. As a result, the expansion of the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad line was approved by the Surface Transportation Board. In 2006 UP and BNSF announced a $100 million investment to provide three track capacity for the entire length of the Joint Line plus a fourth track added over the steepest sections, including Logan Hill. These improvements will enable the Joint Line to handle over 400 million tons of coal.

In 2006, Union Pacific set a record by hauling 194 million tons of coal – an 8% increase compared with 2005 tonnage. The company achieved this by increasing train size, with trains averaging more than 15,000 tons, a 200-ton weight increase compared with fourth-quarter 2005&#x27;s average.
In early 2016 it was reported that 80 to 100 trains of coal were being shipped from the Powder river basin every day. In 2019 train loadings averaged about 50 per day.

<text>CHTG-FM is a Canadian radio station licensed to Haldimand, Ontario, serving the Hamilton region broadcasting at 92.9 FM with a classic hits format branded as &quot;92.9 The Grand&quot;.

==History==
===Application for 92.9===
The station was first licensed in 2005 with the call sign CKNS-FM. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the application for a station serving Haldimand, but assigned the frequency for which the station initially applied, 106.7 FM, to another station in a nearby market (CIKZ). Bel-Roc Communications then applied for 92.9, from a transmitter location approximately 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the original, at lower effective radiated power, but from a higher tower. A contemporaneous competing application from CHCD in nearby Simcoe sought the adjacent frequency, 93.1, for a CHCD repeater in Haldimand.

CHCD alleged that while the parameters proposed for 106.7 would have put a signal into Hamilton sufficient to stay with Haldimand-to-Hamilton commuters and let the station to draw on revenues from the Hamilton radio market, those now proposed for 92.9 would put inadequate signals not only into Hamilton, but into much of Haldimand itself. CHCD contested the station could only survive on advertising revenue from Simcoe and Norfolk County, even in spite a condition of license barring it from soliciting local advertising in Simcoe (and also nearby Brantford).

Individually, CIWV (now CHKX-FM) in Hamilton and Standard Broadcasting, owners of CKLH, CKOC and CHAM in Hamilton, also opposed the application. They contended that the proposed signal into Haldimand was indeed impaired, but that the signal into the Hamilton area was actually significantly &quot;increased&quot;. Standard argued that CKNS would no longer focus uniquely on the Haldimand community; for a time in 2005, the proposed station&#x27;s own website branded it a &quot;Haldimand/Hamilton&quot; station. CIWV – originally co-founded by Rae Roe, who had since sold his stake and gone on to co-found CKNS – suggested that CKNS perhaps be barred from soliciting advertising in Hamilton as well.

In response to these interventions, Bel-Roc agreed that they planned to solicit advertising in Hamilton, but insisted they would focus on Haldimand listeners; they disputed other details of the opposing interventions, and argued that the new parameters were necessary to meet Industry Canada requirements regulating the use of the broadcast spectrum.

The CRTC approved CKNS&#x27; application for 92.9, and denied CHCD&#x27;s for 93.1 FM. This caused significant signal degradation for WBUF, the nearest station on 92.9, across the border in Buffalo, New York.

The application proposed a unique multi-genre Canadian format including a minimum 60% fully qualified Canadian content as defined by CRTC regulations. The balance of music would contain Canadian elements. This percentage was selected to enable the station to play popular music by Canadian artists that does not qualify under present rules as Canadian content.

The proposed format was inspired by Internet radio station LG73, which is in turn inspired by, and an unofficial tribute to, the former Vancouver broadcast station CKLG, when it was an AM station under that brand. CKLG was never exclusively or overwhelmingly devoted to Canadian content as the Internet station or the proposed Haldimand station.

Bel-Roc suggested that they would eventually apply to rebroadcast the station on available frequencies in many other Canadian cities.

===Launch===
After several weeks of test broadcasting, CKNS 92.9 FM officially went on the air at 6:00 a.m. on May 15, 2006, with an adult hits format. Former CKOC 1150 on-air DJ Bob Sherwin launched the station&#x27;s morning show and hosted the morning show until his death on May 16, 2007, of a heart attack. Former FM 108 on-air DJ Burt Thombs launched the station&#x27;s afternoon drive show. The station broadcasts from its offices and studios on Argyle Street South in Caledonia. Some of the station&#x27;s content is also broadcast by live feed directly into the Caledonia studio from remote locations across the country, formerly including Phil Kushnir&#x27;s show out of Vancouver.

===Acquisitions===
Haliburton Broadcasting Group became the controlling shareholder of Bel-Roc Communications in April 2007. That June, the station adopted the CKJN-FM call sign and adopted the brand name &quot;Jayne FM&quot;. In September, CKJN rebranded as &quot;Moose FM&quot;.

On April 23, 2012, Vista Broadcast Group, which owns a number of radio stations in western Canada, announced a deal to acquire Haliburton Broadcasting, in cooperation with Westerkirk Capital. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on October 19, 2012.

On May 26, 2014, CKJN flipped to country as &quot;Country 92.9&quot;.

On July 8, 2016, the CRTC approved the sale &amp; acquisition of the station to Durham Radio. Since CHKX significantly overlaps with CKJN&#x27;s music playlist, it was rumoured that CKJN would flip to an oldies/classic hits format that was last carried by CKOC in Hamilton, until that station flipped to sports talk in September 2015.

On September 1, 2016, the station changed its format to classic hits, branded as &quot;92.9 The Grand&quot; and adopted new call letters CHTG-FM.

<text>Jerry Scoggins (September 30, 1911 – December 7, 2004) was an American country/western singer, guitarist, and band leader. He performed on radio, in movies, and on television from the 1930s thru the 1980s. He was noted for his work with Gene Autry and Bing Crosby and especially for singing &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot;, the theme song to the 1960s sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

== Biography ==
Scoggins was born in Mount Pleasant, Texas in 1911. He sang and played guitar on Dallas radio stations in the early 1930s and in 1936 formed his own group, the Cass County Kids, with John Dodson and Fred Martin. Ten years later in 1946, country musician and cowboy Gene Autry changed their name to the Cass County Boys when he hired them to work on his &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; radio program. They appeared in 17 of his films and worked with him on radio and TV for 12 years while also appearing with Bing Crosby on early 1950s TV. In 1996 the Boys were inducted into Western Music Hall of Fame. They also received a Golden Boot Award from the Motion Picture and Television Fund.

In 1962, Scoggins was working as a stockbroker and singing on weekends when he was asked to sing the theme song for a new sitcom, called &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo while he sang the lyrics. &quot;The Ballad of Jed Clampett&quot; was a smash hit on the charts, with Flatt singing on the single.

In 1993, a retired Scoggins learned that 20th Century Fox was making a film version of the series. He called their offices only to be told that they&#x27;d had no idea he was still alive. The studio preferred Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson to sing the theme song, but the director, Penelope Spheeris, insisted on Scoggins getting the job, which he did. He figured he&#x27;d probably sung the ballad over 1,000 times since the original recording.

Scoggins appeared on-camera, singing the ballad, in the 1993 TV special, &quot;The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Death==
Scoggins died in 2004, from natural causes, in his Westlake Village, California home. He was 93. Scoggins was interred at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park, in Westlake Village, California.

<text>The 42nd New Zealand Parliament was a term of the New Zealand Parliament. Its composition was determined by the 1987 election, and it sat until the 1990 election.

The 42nd Parliament was the second (and final) term of the controversial fourth Labour Party government. Initially, the only other party in the 42nd Parliament was the National Party, with the Democratic Party having lost the two seats it held in the 41st Parliament. Later, a dissident Labour MP, Jim Anderton, would found the NewLabour Party in 1989. Due to internal disputes within the Labour Party, there were three Prime Ministers during the 42nd Parliament: David Lange, Geoffrey Palmer, and Mike Moore.

The 42nd Parliament consisted of ninety-seven representatives. At the time, this was the highest number of representatives that Parliament had had, although it would later be exceeded. All of these representatives were chosen by single-member geographical electorates, including four Māori electorates.

<text>Doug Galt (born 1937 or 1938) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and an unsuccessful contender for the House of Commons of Canada in 2004.

==Background==
Galt was a veterinarian before entering political life. He was an overseas veterinary pathologist and project coordinator for CIDA in 1988 and 1992, and retired as head of the Brighton Veterinary Services Lab in 1994. In the late 1980s, he attended Queen&#x27;s University and earned a Master&#x27;s Degree in public administration. Galt currently lives in the hamlet of Salem, Ontario with his wife Catherine.

==Politics==
He began his political career at the municipal level, serving as a warden in Northumberland County, and as reeve of Cramahe Township. Galt was also a school trustee, and chaired the Colborne-Cramahe Community Economic Development Commission in 1994.

Galt was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal Joan Fawcett by over 6,000 votes in the Northumberland riding. The Progressive Conservatives won the election under the leadership of Mike Harris, and Galt sat as a backbench supporter. He became known for asking &quot;softball&quot; questions (i.e. inoffensive questions which praise the sitting government, and allow ministers to outline new policy initiatives).

Galt was re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, though by only 903 votes over Liberal Carolyn Campbell. He introduced a resolution in the Legislature to bring forward greater protection against cruelty to animals and tried to ban riding in the back of pick-up trucks. Galt also introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to create a Robert Baldwin Day in Ontario which was later endorsed by Andrew Redden in an article published in the &quot;Canadian Parliamentary Review&quot;. In 2000, Galt precipitated a minor crisis in the legislature by accidentally reading out the names of certain young offenders, whose identities were protected by law. Galt was actually praising the young offenders for graduating from a young offenders program while forgetting that they were still young offenders. Rob Sampson, the Minister of Correctional Services, had to temporarily resign from office to show ministerial accountability for Galt&#x27;s error.

Galt served as chair of the Premier&#x27;s Task Force on Rural Economic Renewal, which toured the province and consulted with other jurisdictions. Amongst other initiatives, the findings of this Task Force led to the creation of the O.S.T.A.R. program and Rural Economic Development funding initiative.

Galt supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as party leader in 2002, and was named by Eves as a minister without portfolio and chief government Whip on August 22 of that year.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, and Galt lost his seat to Liberal candidate Lou Rinaldi by approximately 2,500 votes.

===Federal politics===
In early 2004, Galt supported Tony Clement&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to become leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.

Galt himself ran as a Conservative in the 2004 federal election, challenging Liberal incumbent Paul Macklin in the federal riding of Northumberland. Macklin defeated Galt by 313 votes.

<doc id="1261502" wikidata="Q7856376" url="?curid=1261502" title="Turtle Bayou Resolutions">
<text>In 1832, the Anglo-American settlers were involved in a conflict with Mexican commander John Davis Bradburn (also an Anglo-American) near the northern extent of Trinity Bay at Anahuac, Texas. The settlers were opposed to control of their daily affairs by the centralist government. They were primarily at odds with the administration over the subject of tariffs on imports and exports and over the presence of conscripted criminals in the Mexican garrison at Anahuac located at the confluence of the Trinity river and bay four miles south of 

The Anglo militia skirmished with Bradburn&#x27;s troops before retreating north to the crossing on Turtle Bayou near James Taylor White&#x27;s ranch house to await the arrival of artillery.

The settlers received word that the anti-administration Federalist army had won a significant victory under the leadership of Antonio López de Santa Anna.

==Colonists react==

Taking advantage of this favorable news, they verbally aligned themselves with the Federalist cause by composing the Turtle Bayou Resolutions, which explained their attack against the Centralist troops at Anahuac. They explained that they were not lawless Anglos attacking a Mexican garrison, but that they were Federalist sympathizers opposing a Centralist commandant as part of the civil war that had been in progress for two years between the Centralist administration of Anastasio Bustamante and those wanting to return to the Federalist Constitution of 1824.

The four resolutions condemned violations of the 1824 constitution by the Bustamante government and urged all Texans to support the patriots fighting under Santa Anna, who was at the time struggling to defeat military despotism. Though opinions varied among the colonists, few Texans were at that time willing to urge secession.

Federalist colonel José Antonio Mexía arrived in Brazoria, Texas, on July 16, 1832, with 400 troops and five ships to quell a supposed movement to sever Texas from Mexico. A copy of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions was included in the seven-point statement of causes for taking up arms that was presented to Mexía on July 18. The explanations offered by the Texas leaders satisfied the Federalist general, and he returned to the Rio Grande.

==The document==
No signatures are affixed to the extant copy of the resolutions themselves, but seven of the Texas leaders (Wyly Martin, John Austin, Luke Lesassier, William H. Jack, Hugh B. Johnston, Francis W. Johnson, and Robert M. Williamson) signed the combined document presented to Mexía.

The document was published in an extra edition of the Brazoria &quot;Constitutional Advocate&quot; on July 23, 1832, and appeared in Mary Austin Holley&#x27;s &quot;Texas&quot; (1833).

Text of the Turtle Bayou Resolutions 

&quot;First: By their repeated violations of the constitution and laws and the total disregard of the civil and political rights of the people.&quot;

&quot;Second: Jose G Granado fixing and establishing among us, in the time of peace, military posts, the officers of which, totally disregarding the local civil authorities of the State, have committed various acts evincing opposition to the true interest of the people in the enjoyment of civil liberty.&quot;

&quot;Third: By arresting the commissioners, especially Juan Francisco Madero, who, on the part of the State government, was to put the inhabitants east of Trinity River in possession of other lands, in conformity with the laws of colonization.&quot;

&quot;Fourth: By the imposition of military force, preventing the Alcalde of the jurisdiction of Liberty from the exercise of his constitutional functions.&quot;

&quot;Fifth: By appointing to the revenue department of Galveston, a man whose character for infamy had been clearly established, and made known to the Government, and whose principles are avowedly to the true interest of the people of Texas; and that, too, when their character for infamy had been repeatedly established.&quot;

&quot;Sixth: By the military commandant of Anahuac advising and procuring servants to quit the service of their masters, and offering them protection; causing them to labor for his benefits, and refusing to compensate them for the same.&quot;

&quot;Seventh: By imprisonment of our citizens without lawful cause; and claiming the right of trying said citizens by a military court for offense of a character cognizable by the civil authority alone.&quot;

&quot;RESOLVED That we view with feelings of the deepest regret, Tori Tercero manner in which the Government of the Republic of Mexico is administered by the present dynasty - The repeated violations of the constitution - the total disregard for the law - the entire prostration of the civil authority; and the substitution in the stead of military despotism, are grievances of such a character, as to arouse the feelings of every freeman, and impel him to resistance.&quot;

&quot;RESOLVED That we view with feelings of deepest interest and solicitude, the firm and manly resistance which is made by those patriots under the highly and distinguished chieftain Santa Anna, to the numerous encroachments and infractions which have been made by the present administration upon the laws and constitution of our beloved and adopted country.&quot;

&quot;RESOLVED That as freemen devoted to a correct interpretation and enforcement of the Constitution, and laws, according to their true Spirit - We pledge our lives and fortunes in support of the same, and of the distinguished leader, who is now gallantly fighting in defence of Civil Liberty.&quot;

&quot;RESOLVED That all the people of Texas be united to co-operate with us, in support of the principles incorporated in the foregoing resolutions.&quot;

<doc id="1261504" wikidata="Q313351" url="?curid=1261504" title="Frozen (Madonna song)">
<text>&quot;Frozen&quot; is a song by American singer and songwriter Madonna from her seventh studio album, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998). Maverick and Warner Bros. Records released it as the album&#x27;s lead single on January 23, 1998. &quot;Frozen&quot; was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, who both produced it in collaboration with William Orbit. The downtempo electronica ballad, which has a layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings, lyrically addresses a cold and emotionless man.

&quot;Frozen&quot; received acclaim from music critics, some of whom deemed it as a highlight from &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. The song was described as being a masterpiece, and its melodic beat and sound were defined as &quot;cinematic&quot;. &quot;Frozen&quot; was also a global commercial success. In the United States, it became Madonna&#x27;s sixth single to peak at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Frozen&quot; became Madonna&#x27;s first single to debut at number one on the UK Singles Chart, while also reaching number one in Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Scotland and Spain, and the top-five elsewhere.

The accompanying music video for &quot;Frozen&quot;, directed by Chris Cunningham, was filmed at Cuddeback Lake in California, and features Madonna as an ethereal, witch-like, melancholy persona, who shapeshifts into a flock of birds and a black dog. The music video won a Moonman for Best Special Effects in a Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. To promote &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna performed the song live in several occasions, including its first world premiere on Sanremo Music Festival in Italy and on &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; in Germany. Additionally, it was performed in several of her concert tours. &quot;Frozen&quot; has been covered by many artists, such as Swedish hard rock band Talisman, and Polish industrial metal band Thy Disease.

In 2021, a trap remix of &quot;Frozen&quot;, made by Canadian DJ Sickick, became viral on TikTok. On December 3, 2021, it was officially released as the first single from Madonna&#x27;s entire-catalog reissue project. Madonna and Sickick released three further renditions of the remix—the version featuring Nigerian singer Fireboy DML, the version featuring American rapper 070 Shake, and the version featuring vocals from Sickick himself titled &quot;Frozen on Fire&quot;—all of which were supported by music videos. The Sickick remix charted within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Songs chart, and was certified Gold in France and Poland.

== Background and release ==

By the mid to late 1990s, Madonna was in a more mature and introspective mood, after giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, gaining interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, and earning the title role of Eva Perón in the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Evita&quot; (1996). In 1997, Madonna began working on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, her seventh studio album and wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer&#x27;s changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a &quot;deeply spiritual dance record&quot;, with the crux of it based on Madonna&#x27;s career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed. The singer began introspecting herself with motherhood being a &quot;big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I&#x27;d never asked myself before&quot;, she said to &quot;Q&quot; magazine.

Madonna worked primarily with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records&#x27; partner, phoned Orbit and suggested that he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and &quot;Frozen&quot; was among these tracks. &quot;I was a huge fan of William&#x27;s earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time&quot;, Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1990 British-Italian drama film, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the &quot;whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe&quot; for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with &quot;tribal feel, something really lush and romantic&quot;. They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing to write the track.

A low quality snippet of &quot;Frozen&quot; was leaked by fans on January 23, 1998, after it debuted on radio in Singapore, and posted it on the Internet. They said they knew what they were doing was wrong, but that they hoped it would simply generate interest from Madonna. The song was played on US radio, including WKTU New York radio. Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)&#x27;s Anti-Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads of the song. Erik Bradley, musical director of Chicago B96, classified &quot;Frozen&quot; as a &quot;the mark of a smash. Clearly, American pop radio needs Madonna&quot;, after he played the track on his station. According to Jon Uren, marketing director of Warner Music Europe, the song also had &quot;fantastic&quot; early support across Europe, where the song was added to radio the same day that the snippet was leaked. Shortly after the leak, a remix version of &quot;Frozen&quot; was broadcast by the BBC website, and was also previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Frozen&quot; was issued as a CD single, a 12-inch vinyl single, and a cassette single on February 23, 1998. The track was officially serviced to radio in the United States on February 19, 1998, and was released commercially on March 3, 1998.

== Composition and recording ==

&quot;Frozen&quot; is a downtempo electronica ballad which has a layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings, arranged by Craig Armstrong. It was composed using common time in the key of F minor, with a moderate tempo of 102 beats per minute. &quot;Frozen&quot; has a basic sequence of Fm–E–D–E as its chord progression. The chorus, however, has the chord progression of Fm–Bm–D–A. Madonna&#x27;s vocals range from the lower octave of F3 to the higher note of A4.

The song begins with austere, classical strings while the chord progression emphasizes tonic, submediant and flattened leading-tone chords. For the second phrase, which includes a dramatic crescendo, rhythm and ambient electronic effects are added gradually. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors from &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, commented that the song is strongly inspired by different forms of classical music, notably contemporary classical music such as neoromanticism, as well as Italian opera composers and pieces such as Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s vocals have drawn comparisons to medieval music.

Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; described Orbit&#x27;s drum and electronic programming as &quot;extraordinarily abstract for a global smash – a kind of cold, bassless dub approach, where the gaps, echoes and drop-outs matter as much as the beats, which spread sharply, like sudden cracks on a frozen surface. They need Armstrong&#x27;s strings to hold the song together. And those strings in turn – a dark, Arctic sea of swells and crests – need the beats to sound more perilous than comforting.&quot;

Lyrically, the song is about a cold and emotionless man. In the first verse, Madonna enters in a medium range, &#x27;You only see what your eyes want to see&#x27;. In the chorus, dance rhythm and ambient sounds are added. In the second verse, more visceral lyrics are added, like &#x27;Love is a bird, she needs to fly&#x27;. During the bridge, a broad, string lines provide instrumental commentary on the lyrics. The song ends with a string ostinato that simply fades away, without fully resolving to the tonic chord. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Madonna commented that the lyrics to &quot;Frozen&quot; are built around &quot;Retaliation, revenge, hate, regret, that&#x27;s what I deal with in &quot;Frozen&quot;. Everyone&#x27;s going to say, &#x27;That&#x27;s a song about Carlos&#x27; [her ex-boyfriend], but it&#x27;s not really; it&#x27;s just about people in general&quot;.

&quot;Frozen&quot; was recorded along with the rest of the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. It was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York. The DAT contained the main portion of the song recordings, as well as preliminary demo sessions in Madonna&#x27;s house in New York, as well as Hit Factory Studios where Madonna first sang the song. Like most of the album, &quot;Frozen&quot; was recorded on a Roland Juno-106. Madonna and Orbit had conducted a drummer session in Los Angeles, but it did not work out. So he contacted Fergus Gerrand who played drum samples for him in London. Orbit fed them in his workstation and cut them manually, instead of using auto-editing software like ReCycle.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Frozen&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; complimented the track&#x27;s production and deemed it &quot;one of the great pop masterpieces of the late 1990s&quot;, adding &quot;Its lyrics are uncomplicated but its statement is grand.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Paul Verna described the song as &quot;smashing&quot;. In a separate review, Larry Flick called it a &quot;stunning foray into the realm of electronica [which] [...] underground purists and unwavering popstars will equally applaud&quot;. Rob Sheffield from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented positively about the &quot;arctic melancholy&quot; of the song. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;&#x27;s J.D. Considine called it a word-focused, emotionally nuanced ballad.

&quot;Music Week&quot; named it Single of the Week, giving it five out of five and praising the song as &quot;inspirational&quot;, &quot;classic Madonna&quot; and &quot;surely guaranteed the top spot.&quot; Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; was impressed how Madonna, dulcet and careful, performed the song. Joan Anderman from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said that on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, only &quot;Frozen&quot; achieves a &quot;state of divine balladry&quot;, recalls the &quot;emotional pitch&quot; and simmers the &quot;beauty of 1986&#x27;s &#x27;Live to Tell&#x27; with a dark, lush string section, the smash and patter of a lone drum, and an ominous, pulsing buzz&quot;. In his review of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Neil Spencer of &quot;The Observer&quot; commented, &quot;it&#x27;s sensuous songs such as [...] &#x27;Frozen&#x27; that stand out; music for the chill-out room.&quot; &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; agreed that the song was appropriate for chilling out.
Elysa Gardner, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said &quot;Madonna&#x27;s enduring knack for incorporating hip and exotic textures into accessible pop tunes is evident on the plaintive single &#x27;Frozen&#x27;&quot;.
&quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; viewed the track as the singer &quot;at her soothing best&quot;, highlighting its &quot;interesting percussion backing&quot; and &quot;beautiful use of strings with techno effects&quot;.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the song as a &quot;wuthering-beats melodrama that&#x27;s often breathtaking.&quot; Also from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chuck Arnold wrote: &quot;sounding unlike anything Madonna had ever done before, and creating a mystical forest of sonic wonder — sweeping strings and all — &#x27;Frozen&#x27; possesses an almost operatic grandeur that never fails to give you chills&quot;. Stephen Thompson from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;the atmospheric &#x27;Frozen&#x27; is a great first single despite lyrics like, &#x27;Love is a bird / She needs to fly.&#x27;&quot; 
Conversely, &quot;NME&quot; called the song &quot;another pile of her usual weepy old bollocks&quot;. Jim Farber of the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;Frozen&quot; compromises its electronic style with &quot;too much tepid pop&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan regarded it as a tremulous song &quot;Ray of Light&quot; could have done without.
Jose F. Thomas from AllMusic rated the song two stars out of five, describing it as &quot;chilly&quot;.

== Accolades ==
In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their &quot;Top 20 Madonna singles of all-time&quot;, by &quot;Q&quot; magazine. &quot;Frozen&quot; was allocated the number ten spot on the list. &quot;Billboard&quot; also ranked &quot;Frozen&quot; at number 25 on a list containing Madonna&#x27;s 40 hits, stating that the song marked a sonic change in Madonna&#x27;s career. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also ranked the song as Madonna&#x27;s sixth best song of all time according to a readers&#x27; poll, saying that the song strikes &quot;the perfect balance of pop accessibility, sophisticated balladry and cutting-edge electronic textures&quot;. VH1&#x27;s Mark Graham included &quot;Frozen&quot; on his list of his favorite songs from Madonna at number 36 during a list compiled in honor of the singer&#x27;s 53rd birthday.

In May 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the top songs of 1998, ranking &quot;Frozen&quot; at number 31. Frank Digiacomo from the publication asserted that the composition showed &quot;a wiser, more mature Madonna, one still at the top of her game&quot;. While ranking Madonna&#x27;s singles, in honor of her 60th birthday, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Jude Rogers placed &quot;Frozen&quot; at number 7. She wrote: &quot;Dark, orchestral ambient is a mood at which Madonna excels. &#x27;Frozen&#x27; marries the different temperatures of 90s pop stunningly – the faltering chill of William Orbit&#x27;s electronica with the dusty, cinematic heat of North African melodies and strings&quot;. Finally, in August 2018, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed it as the singer&#x27;s 18th best single.

== Commercial performance ==

== Music video ==
Directed by British artist Chris Cunningham, the music video for &quot;Frozen&quot; was filmed at Cuddeback Lake in the Mojave Desert in California during January 7–11, 1998. It was shot by cinematographer Darius Khondji. In an interview with Kurt Loder on the set of the video, Madonna described herself as a &quot;mystical creature in the desert&quot;. It was inspired by the 1996 film &quot;The English Patient&quot; and Martha Graham&#x27;s work. The music video premiered on February 16, 1998, on MTV at 4 p.m. The black dress Madonna wears on the video was designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. In an interview with MTV News, Cunningham stated about his work with Madonna that she became interested in working with him after seeing his Aphex Twin-directed music video, &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; (1997).

Madonna stated that she and her team initially thought of filming the video in Iceland, as the idea of the video was to go someplace cold with snow, but decided against the idea. She said she thought:


The video introduces a sober, contemplative Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It begins with the camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above the ground in the distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an Om symbol on one palm. In the video, she slowly gestures and sways her arms towards the sky, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point, she falls backward, hits the ground, and transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amidst the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and the singer levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another version of herself, curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.

Jim Glauner from MTV News commented that from the first scene of the video, the viewer discovers that this is not &quot;Holiday&quot; (1983). Matthias Groß in his book &quot;Madonna On the Couch: A Psychoanalytic View on Madonna&#x27;s Music Videos&quot;, argued that it is interesting to look at the video as a dream, and noted that in the video, Madonna was presented as a witch or an uncanny creature, by the technique of the central perspective. He concluded that the viewers find themselves in control of their view, of the situation in general, and are conveyed the impression to follow a realistic depiction of a mere melancholic woman in the desert, according to him. Henry Keazor and Thorsten Wübbena of &quot;Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video&quot; said that the large panels of cloth that gather and wind around Madonna gain an even more obvious independent movement quality. &quot;Billboard&quot; considered it Madonna&#x27;s third-best video noting that it &quot;conveys the song&#x27;s bleak heartbreak perfectly&quot; with Madonna&#x27;s persona in the video. Steve Murgatroyd, Dan Williams, Steve Hiam, and Anthony Walsham received the MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects for &quot;Frozen&quot; at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. The video can be found on the Madonna compilations, &quot;The Video Collection 93:99&quot; (1999) and &quot;&quot; (2009).

== Sickick remixes ==
On March 30, 2021, Canadian producer Sickick posted a video of him in a mask remixing &quot;Frozen&quot; on a video sharing app TikTok. This rendition has been used in over 1.5 million TikTok clips as of December 2022, based around cooking and hair-pulling challenges; and has been watched over 26 million times. On December 3, 2022, the remix was officially released on digital retailers and music streaming platforms, as the first release of Madonna&#x27;s plan of re-releasing of her entire catalogue. The Sickick remix impacted Italian radio airplay on January 24, 2022. Between March and May 2022, Madonna released three additional versions of the Sickick remix, each featuring vocals by Nigerian singer Fireboy DML, American rapper 070 Shake, and Sickick himself.

Sickick&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Frozen&quot; is predominantly a trap song, but it also has been described as EDM, minimal, and electro. It consists of Madonna&#x27;s chopped up vocals taken from the original version of the track, which has been called &quot;now-iconic&quot; by &quot;The Fader&quot;″s Raphael Helfand. The remix begins with a line &quot;How can life be what you want it to be? You&#x27;re frozen, when your heart&#x27;s not open.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Gil Kaufman called the rendition &quot;slowed-down&quot; and &quot;gauzy&quot;. Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;The Fader&quot; and Sebas Alonso of &quot;Jenesaispop&quot; criticized Madonna for releasing too many renditions of the remix, the former&#x27;s problem was over-promotion, while the latter&#x27;s point was that they were short.

Commercially, &quot;Frozen (Remix)&quot; debuted at number 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, gathering 496,000 U.S. streams and 1,800 units. On April 16, 2022, the rendition ascended to number ten on the chart, becoming Madonna&#x27;s third top ten song on the survey, while being first for Sickick. In the week, it gained 2.3 million streams―which is a 45% gain―and 1,000 paid downloads―gain of 15%. Additionally, the remix peaked at number 5 on Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart. Until May 2022, the song received over 125 million global streams across all streaming platforms, with 8.4 million of them coming from the United States, as of March 2022.

=== Fireboy DML remix ===
On March 1, 2022, Madonna shared a picture of her and Nigerian singer Fireboy DML on her Instagram, announcing new remix. Two days later, aforementioned remix has been released for digital download and streaming through Artist Partner Group and Warner Records. On the same day, both artists teased a music video on Instagram calling each other &quot;fire&quot;, whilst Fireboy DML wrote: &quot;Love to the queen for having me on this classic.&quot; This rendition starts with Madonna vocals, later featuring new lyrics performed by the featured artist, which talk about heartbreak: &quot;Don&#x27;t make me waste my time / I&#x27;ve been waiting all my life&quot;. He later croons &quot;I thought you loved me / I thought you trusted me / I tried to take care of your heart / but it&#x27;s frozen.&quot; For the outro, the song returns to Madonna&#x27;s vocals.

Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Mike Wass commented that Fireboy DML &quot;laments over Sickick&#x27;s sweeping trap beats&quot; and takes the song to &quot;soulful direction, plunging deeper into heartbreak territory&quot;. George Griffiths of Official Charts Company called the rendition &quot;TikTok friendly&quot; and additionally wrote: &quot;The song morphs from Madonna&#x27;s ice-cold, electronica-influenced vocals, shifting into something of trap beat for Fireboy DML&#x27;s verse.&quot; Hannah Dailey from &quot;Billboard&quot; described Firboy DML&#x27;s vocals as &quot;smooth&quot;. Kaufman of the same publication called the rendition &quot;hypnotic&quot;. &quot;Jenesaispop&quot;″s Iker Oroz called this remix &quot;insubstantial&quot; while Sebas Alonso writing for the same publication, opined that the performers are lacking chemistry on the track.

The music video for the rendition premiered on Madonna&#x27;s YouTube channel on March 10, 2022. It wasdirected by Ricardo Gomes and spans for almost three minutes. During the shooting, Madonna jokingly mentions being drunk and called herself &quot;Merdonna&quot;. The first 25 seconds of the clip focus on Madonna&#x27;s eye and road imagery. When the beat kicks in, a shot of black doberman from the original video appears. Madonna is seen wearing long straight hair, black leather corset with black long sleeves, black short shorts, and black gloves, complemented by &quot;Madame X&quot; cross jewelry. Multiple shots of her are shown next, taken from different angles, and projecting her smoking among other shots mixed with flashing lights and scenery taken from the original &quot;Frozen&quot; visual. After that, Fireboy DML appears; he is being seen kneeling down next to Madonna&#x27;s leg and singing his verses in front of background displaying flames. The pair is also dancing with each other. At the end of the clip, Madonna blows her hair in the wind and reaches her arms out. Kenna McCafferty from &quot;Paper&quot; called the visual &quot;captivating&quot;, and said that it presents &quot;the perfect combination of Fire &amp; Ice&quot;. Yohann Ruelle of &quot;Pure Charts&quot; opined that the clip is &quot;hot&quot;; whilst &quot;Jenesaispop&quot; writers were not keen of the video, describing it as &quot;insubstantial&quot; and &quot;not difficult&quot;.

=== 070 Shake remix ===

On March 25, 2022, Madonna announced another Sickick remix of &quot;Frozen&quot; through Instagram, this time featuring American rapper and singer 070 Shake. In the post, she called 070 Shake &quot;one of [her] favorite artists&quot;. For days, the singer teased the remix, showing off snaps of its music video. This rendition was released six days later, on March 31. Following the remix&#x27;s release, Madonna posted a statement about the featured artist, saying: &quot;070 Shake is indescribably mysterious and alluring. There are very few women in the trap music world that aren&#x27;t pandering to men. Her lyrics are deep and unique – there is no one like her. I&#x27;m excited for the world to discover her!&quot; In &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, she wanted to ensure that this remix incorporated LGBTQ representation.

070 Shake&#x27;s remix of &quot;Frozen&quot; has been described as an &quot;emotional ballad&quot;, where she &quot;chant[s] hoarsely over Madonna&#x27;s quavering coo and Sickick&#x27;s deep bass rumbles.&quot; &quot;Jenesaispop&quot; reported that the chorus line, &quot;I feel close enough to heaven / To go, to stay, to leave, to pray&quot;, might be a reference to Dua Lipa&#x27;s 2020 song &quot;Levitating&quot;, whose the Blessed Madonna remix featured Madonna alongside Missy Elliott. Kat Bouza from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that this rendition is &quot;haunting&quot; and 070 Shake&#x27;s delivery is &quot;ethereal&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Tom Breithan opined that the featured artist &quot;sounds cool as hell&quot;, while the remix itself &quot;sounds like a complete song&quot;. Daniela Avila of &quot;People&quot; labeled the track a &quot;vibey tune&quot;. Kaufman called the remix &quot;moody&quot; and &quot;chopped-and-screwed&quot;, while 070 Shake&#x27;s verses have been described as &quot;sleepy eyed&quot;.

An accompanying music video was released on the same day as the remix and was directed by Ryan Drake and Ricardo Gomes. Madonna wears a blonde wig, black sunglasses, a leather jacket, and platform boots, while on some shots, her look is complemented by fishnets and a mini dress. The video starts with the singer driving to 070 Shake in the night, which she encounters behind a wired fence. Later, the visual features clips of the performers in &quot;various dark, hypnotic angles&quot;, before the video ends with the scene of them driving away together. Breithan suggested that the music video might be video game-inspired. Alonso likens this clip to Madonna&#x27;s 2001 visual for &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;, due to the usage of a remix in the video and cars.

=== Frozen on Fire ===

The fourth rendition of Sickick&#x27;s remix, titled &quot;Frozen on Fire&quot;, features vocals by the DJ himself. Madonna re-recorded some of her lines with intention to &quot;remind people that [she] wrote this song.&quot; &quot;Frozen on Fire&quot; is reminiscent of the version that Sickick uploaded to his YouTube channel in December 2021, with him having his own verse.&quot; When Sickick initially presented that version to Madonna, she was &quot;blown away by his musicianship, by his sense of musicality, by his melody, his singing,&quot; and felt the similarity of his voice to the Weeknd.

The first verse of &quot;Frozen on Fire&quot; makes reference to Sickick &quot;popping Molly&quot;, a seemingly subtle nod to Madonna&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;MDNA&quot; (2012). For this version, the original ending of the second verse was shortened to fit Madonna&#x27;s vocals. According to D&#x27;Souza, this iteration is a trap-pop song evoking pop spirit of the original. He later elaborated that it &quot;is the platonic ideal of a 2022 Madonna update. It’s alien and icy and kind of intoxicating.&quot;

&quot;Frozen on Fire&quot; was released on May 19, 2022, for digital download and streaming through Warner Records and Artist Partner Group, whereas the song was sent to Italian radio airplay next day. This version&#x27;s music video premiered on YouTube on May 19, which is a collective montage of all her three music videos for the song, whilst its lyric video was uploaded five days later.

== Live performances ==
Before the release of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, Madonna appeared on several television shows and events to promote the album, and would sometimes perform the song. Madonna first performed &quot;Frozen&quot; on February 21, on BBC 1&#x27;s &quot;The National Lottery Show&quot;. Additionally, that same month, she appeared and performed the song at the Sanremo Music Festival 1998 on February 24 and on the German TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. On April 29, 1998, Madonna made an unannounced appearance at the 9th annual Rainforest Foundation Benefit Concert at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, where she performed &quot;Frozen&quot; with the East Harlem Violin Project, while wearing a Versace dress. Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that during this performance Madonna had &quot;turned herself into America&#x27;s answer to Björk&quot;. Later that occasion, she wore a cowboy hat and joined various artists in a rendition of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; and &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot;.
&quot;Frozen&quot; has also been included on four of Madonna&#x27;s concert tours. For the 2001 Drowned World Tour, &quot;Frozen&quot; was included on the show&#x27;s second segment known as &quot;Geisha–Anime&quot;. As the &quot;Paradise (Not for Me)&quot; video interlude ended, Madonna appeared on stage as a kabuki-like figure, wearing a short black wig and dressed in a red and black, hand-painted kimono created by designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, with enormous sleeves creating a span of about fifty feet (4.5 m). As the song progresses, she gradually breaks loose from the sleeves and dances, with synchronized karate moves distributed along all sides of the stage, by herself and with her dancers. A samurai dancer also appeared on a raised platform above her during the performance while the backdrops displayed silhouettes of burning trees against racing, blood-red clouds. &quot;MusicOMH&quot; praised the performance for &quot;having a recognisable beat unlike the studio recording&quot;. The performance of the song on August 26, 2001, at the Palace of Auburn Hills was recorded and released in the live video album, &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot;.

On the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, &quot;Frozen&quot; was performed as the last song of the tour&#x27;s &quot;French Baroque–Marie Antoinette&quot; Revival opening segment. After an energetic performance of &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, Madonna performed the song standing alone on the middle of the stage, wearing a gold jewel-encrusted corset created by designer Christian Lacroix, as the backdrop screens displayed the video of a naked male and a naked female wrestling, caressing and intertwining in water, with their faces and genitals darkened by shadows so as to preserve their androgyny. Sal Sinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the performance a negative review, commenting that Madonna should never do a performance like this.

For the second European leg of Madonna&#x27;s Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour in 2009, the performance of &quot;Hung Up&quot; was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of &quot;Frozen&quot;. This performance was included on the show&#x27;s fourth and final &quot;Rave&quot; segment, where it was set between the performances of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. The video backdrops used for this performance featured outtakes from the song&#x27;s original music video directed by Chris Cunningham. Madonna sampled DJ Calvin Harris&#x27; 2009 single &quot;I&#x27;m Not Alone&quot; into the performance. Harris praised the version saying, &quot;I never imagined when I made it in my little purple room in Glasgow in my flat that it would reach far and wide as it has – it&#x27;s always a privilege.&quot; Six years later, on October 1, 2015, Madonna performed an acoustic version of &quot;Frozen&quot; on the Detroit stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. She repeated the performance for the San Jose and San Antonio shows of the tour. On the 2019–20 Madame X Tour, Madonna performed &quot;Frozen&quot; as her daughter Lourdes Leon appeared on screen projections. Chuck Arnold from the &quot;New York Post&quot; called it the show&#x27;s highlight. The performance was included on the 2021 live album &quot;Madame X: Music from the Theater Xperience&quot;.

On January 11, 2024, Madonna added the Sickick remix of the track to the setlist of The Celebration Tour (2023-2024), in replacement of &quot;Rain&quot; (1992); Tom Beedham of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; opined that the remix &quot;gave Madonna&#x27;s track more gravitational pull as she sang under the spotlight from the centre of the arena&quot;.

== Covers and usage in media ==

A rock cover was recorded by Jeff Scott Soto with the Talisman band for their 1998 album &quot;Truth&quot;. A reviewer from Melodic Rock was positive about the version and called it a &quot;moody version with the backing vocals and accompanying keyboards intact.&quot; Polish industrial metal band Thy Disease used parts of the original strings and vocals in a cover on their 2001 album, &quot;Devilsh Act of Creation&quot;. Doom Kounty Electric Chair gave the song a &quot;dark rock&quot; feel with their cover, released in 2004.

Italian rock band Absinth Effect recorded a cover version of &quot;Frozen&quot; for their debut album in 2009. In May 2013, contestant Olympe sang the song on the second season of the French version of &quot;The Voice: la plus belle voix&quot;, allowing him to reach the show&#x27;s semi-final. His coach, Jenifer, welcomed the performance warmly. Jérôme Vermelin from Metronews.fr said &quot;Without piano, but in a spectacular setting, the young singer from Amiens shows his pitched voice with disconcerting facility. And his look? The mixture of great and pure sincerity? Although the formula may seem repetitive, it is not difficult to be captivated&quot;. Hanane Abdelouahed from TF1 commented that with the rendition, he &quot;has taken the track from the queen of pop&quot;.

== Plagiarism accusation ==
In November 2005, a Belgian judge in Mons ruled that the opening four-bar theme to &quot;Frozen&quot; was plagiarized from the song &quot;Ma vie fout le camp&quot; (&quot;My Life&#x27;s Getting Nowhere&quot;), composed by Salvatore Acquaviva. Victor Vicent Dehin, Acquaviva&#x27;s lawyer, said: &quot;We tried to reach a friendly agreement... but they didn&#x27;t want to negotiate so I sued for plagiarism. They have stolen a song, so they have to pay the value of the song.&quot; No award damages for the song were granted. Acquaviva had explained to the court that the singer heard &quot;Ma vie fout l&#x27;camp&quot; during a trip to Mouscron in the late 1970s. She had been recruited to be a dancer on a tour with French singer Patrick Hernandez, whose discs were produced in Mouscron. Dehin also stated that the lawsuit was just the first step, and the next discussion would be about the copyright gains Madonna obtained with &quot;Frozen&quot;.

The judge subsequently ordered the withdrawal from sales of all remaining discs of &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, and forbade any further playing of the song on Belgian TV and radio. Warner Bros., EMI and Sony were also ordered to spread the decision within fifteen days to media outlets on pain of a penalty of €125,000 for non-compliance with the court order. While the case was still going on, Madonna performed &quot;Frozen&quot; during the Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour in Werchter on July 11, 2009. Bert Bieseman, marketing manager of Belgian branch of Warner Bros., stated that &quot;Madonna is not afraid of a more or less riot&quot;. Acquaviva responded to the performance: &quot;The court&#x27;s decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can&#x27;t be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won&#x27;t bring additional spectacle to the show.&quot; The song was later omitted from the track listing on the Belgian pressings of &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009).

In February 2014, a Belgian court repealed the verdict on the case and proclaimed that Madonna did not plagiarize Acquaviva&#x27;s work. The court spoke of a &quot;new capital offense&quot; in the file: composer Edouard Scotto Di Suoccio and societies Tabata Atoll Music and Music in Paris had also filed a complaint for plagiarism. According to them, both &quot;Ma vie fout le camp&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; originated in the song &quot;Blood Night&quot; which they composed in 1983. After all three tracks in the case were compared, the final ruling was that the songs were &quot;not sufficiently &#x27;original&#x27; to claim&quot; that any plagiarism had taken place. This ruling ended the eight-year ban of the song in place in Belgium since 2005.

<doc id="1261508" wikidata="Q297734" url="?curid=1261508" title="Nerina Pallot">
<text>Nerina Natasha Georgina Pallot (born 26 April 1974) is a British singer, songwriter and producer, who has released eight albums and over a dozen EPs. She was nominated for British Female Solo Artist at the 2007 BRIT Awards and nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Sophia&quot; in the category of &#x27;Best Song (musically and lyrically)&#x27; in the same year. Besides her own material, Pallot has written songs for Kylie Minogue and Diana Vickers. She mostly tours around the UK and is married to record producer Andy Chatterley.

==Early life==
Pallot was born in London and brought up in Jersey by a half-French father and a mother from Prayag, India, together with her sister. Pallot played piano as a child and wrote her first song aged 13. She has identified seeing singer and pianist Kate Bush perform her hit song &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; on television series &quot;Wogan&quot; as a catalyst for her to pursue a music career. She attended Jersey College for Girls and received a music scholarship for Wellington College.

==Career==
===2001–2003: &quot;Dear Frustrated Superstar&quot;===
Pallot released her debut album, &quot;Dear Frustrated Superstar&quot;, on Polydor records in August 2001. This spawned two singles, &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;. She was subsequently dropped from the label mainly due to failing sales. The album was eventually re-issued several years later after her second album, &quot;Fires&quot; had become a commercial success. Her then-manager Richard Ogden noted that his company spent &quot;three years managing her while she had a huge record deal and was a massive priority for Polydor. We did the best job we possibly could, but it just didn&#x27;t happen&quot;.

In 2003 she sang lead vocals on the track &quot;Truly&quot; on Delerium&#x27;s album &quot;Chimera&quot;, which was also released as a single in the UK.

===2004–2008: &quot;Fires&quot;===
Her second album, &quot;Fires&quot;, was released in April 2005 on her own independent label, Idaho. It was published by Chrysalis Music Publishing, to whom she remained signed and provided her with a development deal. They initially provided her with £50,000 to make the album. When that proved insufficient for Pallot&#x27;s needs, she remortgaged her house to complete the rest of the album.

The album was produced and mixed by Howard Willing together with producers Eric Rosse who produced &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot; and &quot;Heart Attack&quot; (co-produced by Willing) and Wendy Melvoin who produced &quot;Damascus&quot;. After the initial tracks were finished the rest of the record was apparently completed by Willing and Pallot flying back and forth from London to Los Angeles.

The album was preceded by a download-only single, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gone to War&quot;. A second single from the record, &quot;Damascus&quot; was released in June 2005, and a third, &quot;All Good People&quot; (a Radio 2 single of the week) was released in September 2005. She performed at the 2005 Guildfest music festival and headlined her own show at Bush Hall in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London later that year.

At the end of 2005, Pallot signed with 14th Floor Records (a Warner label), who re-issued the album after adding strings on some tracks, on 24 April 2006, earning Pallot a chart success by reaching Number 21. With over 100,000 sales it was certified gold in the UK.

The first single from the revamped album was &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gone to War&quot;, which was playlisted on most major British radio stations. The single became the third most played song on British radio the week before its release, and reached Number 14 in the UK Singles Chart. She undertook her first full headlining tour in support of the &quot;Fires&quot; album in May 2006. During the year she also played headline shows in London at ICA, the Bloomsbury Theatre, Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre and at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

The second single from the album was &quot;Sophia&quot;, a re-recorded version, created in LA along with producer Mitchell Froom, entered the UK singles chart at Number 32. In April 2007, the song was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award, while she toured around the UK and Ireland in January and February of that year. The next single from the re-released version of &quot;Fires&quot; was &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;, which reached Number 70 in the UK singles chart.

===2009–2010: &quot;The Graduate&quot;===
Pallot worked with several big name co-writers in preparation for the follow-up to &quot;Fires&quot;, including Linda Perry (Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful&quot;) and Rob Davis (Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;). She also wrote an album&#x27;s worth of material with Rick Nowels (Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot;, Belinda Carlisle&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Is A Place on Earth&quot;). However, she struggled with the co-writing process and in the end only self-written songs made the album.

&quot;The Graduate&quot; was released on 5 October 2009 in the UK and reached number 46 on the Official UK Albums Chart in its first week of release. The standard version of the album features 10 original tracks, whereas the iTunes version contains three additional tracks, and the deluxe version contains seven acoustic versions of the tracks. The album polarised critics, with some lauding it as her best album yet and others seeing her change of direction from &quot;Fires&quot; as a mistake. Having had no intention of releasing &quot;Fires 2&quot;, Pallot has defended the need for a progression between the two records. She toured the UK in October 2009, including a performance at Glasgow&#x27;s Oran Mor venue on Wednesday 7 October, showcasing songs from the new album &quot;The Graduate&quot;.

===2011–2013: &quot;Year of the Wolf&quot;===
In July 2010, Pallot returned to Geffen Records and to the A&amp;R that first signed her to Polydor while embarking on an eight-day tour around the UK and Ireland. She confirmed her new album would be titled &quot;Year of the Wolf&quot; via her Twitter page on 21 January 2011. She recorded with Bernard Butler for the album. The lead single was &quot;Put Your Hands Up&quot;, released 24 April, while the album was released 13 June 2011.

===2014: &quot;Year of the EPs&quot;===
For her next project, Pallot decided to release an EP every month in 2014, as she &quot;just got sick of the album, tour, single... that whole cycle&quot;. The first was called &quot;The Hold Tight&quot; in January, followed by &quot;We Should Break Up&quot; in February. She found that &quot;I&#x27;m at a point in my career where I can pretty much make it up now. I&#x27;ve also realised that a true fan base [...] cares about hearing as much music as they can get their hands on&quot;. Pallot supported the releases with a handful of tour dates across the UK. In September 2015 she released her fifth album &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;.

===2015–2016: &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;===
In 2015, Pallot independently released her fifth studio album &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; via her own Idaho label.

===2017: &quot;Stay Lucky&quot;===
2017 saw the release of Pallot&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Stay Lucky&quot;. The album includes the track &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, which takes its title from Carson McCullers&#x27; debut novel of 1940 - and which Pallot herself has described as &#x27;the best song I have ever written&#x27;. 

===2022: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What I&#x27;m Doing&quot;===
2022 saw the release of Pallot&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What I&#x27;m Doing&quot;

===2024: &quot;A Psalm for Emily Salvi&quot;===
In 2024, Pallot released her eighth studio album, &quot;A Psalm for Emily Salvi&quot;. &quot;Regrets&quot; was the first single from the album.

===Videos===
Pallot has released six videos to go with singles from &quot;Dear Frustrated Superstar&quot;, &quot;Fires&quot;, and &quot;Year of the Wolf&quot;.

Her first video for &quot;Patience&quot;, directed by Swedish director Emma Hvengaard, features Pallot in various scenes, notably wearing white and barefoot, continually floating to and from earth. &quot;Alien&quot; begins with Pallot lying down, it then becomes apparent that she had fallen onto a plumber&#x27;s van, crushing it, and the video implies she has fallen from the sky &quot;like an alien&quot;. The unreleased &quot;If I Know You&quot; video features multiple Nerinas fighting each other in a theatre.

For &quot;Damascus&quot;, Pallot is seen playing piano and singing in a recording studio. Pallot&#x27;s next video was for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gone to War&quot;, which includes cabbage-throwing goths and pineapple bombs. Her next video was for &quot;Sophia&quot;, and was filmed in the middle of the desert in Morocco. It has Pallot sitting at a piano, playing and singing while fire surrounds her in a circle and her piano smokes and is also alight. Pallot&#x27;s next performance, &quot;Learning to Breathe&quot;, is more &quot;abstract&quot; and is computer-generated with her playing the guitar in a house with many pictures decorating the walls.

The video for &quot;Put Your Hands Up&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Year of the Wolf&quot;, was shot in and around Lant Street in Southwark, London.

==History==
The &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) was the original paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party of Germany. It played a significant role in Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in the 1920s and early 1930s. Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot; of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot; of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and intimidating Romani, trade unionists, and especially Jews. To centralise the loyalty of the SA, Hitler personally assumed command of the entire organisation in 1930 and remained for the duration of the group&#x27;s existence. After 1931, those who held the rank of (Chief of staff), such as Ernst Röhm, were accepted as the commanders of the SA.

===Insignia===
The had no particular uniform insignia and was a paramilitary title that could be denoted in a variety of ways. Hermann Göring, for instance, created an elaborate uniform, with swastika armband accompanied with white service stripes. In contrast, Maurice wore simply a brown Nazi storm trooper shirt with no insignia, as did Hitler when he held the title of .

<doc id="1261512" wikidata="Q1357872" url="?curid=1261512" title="José Miguel Insulza">
<text>José Miguel Insulza Salinas (born June 2, 1943) is a Chilean politician, lawyer, and academic serving as a senator for the Arica y Parinacota Region since 2018. He previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1994 to 1999 and Minister Secretary-General of the Presidency from 1999 to 2000 under president Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, as Minister of the Interior from 2000 to 2005 under president Ricardo Lagos, and as Secretary General of the Organization of American States from 2005 to 2015.
Insulza is nicknamed &quot;El Panzer&quot; in Chile, for his tank-like drive and reputation due to his ability to take political heat with little apparent damage. He is married to Georgina Núñez Reyes (Mexican) and has three children.

==Early life and education==
Insulza completed his primary and secondary education at St. George&#x27;s College, an elite American English-language school in Santiago, Chile. He demonstrated an early interest in civil service while studying law at the University of Chile, serving as president of the Law Students Center, vice president of the University of Chile Student Federation (FECH), and President of the National Association of Student Unions (UFUCH). After graduating from law school, he obtained a graduate degree from the Latin American Social Sciences Faculty (FLACSO) and a Master of Arts in political science from the University of Michigan. He was professor of Political Theory at the University of Chile and of Political Science at the Catholic University in Chile until 1973.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
Insulza was a member of the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU) from 1969 to 1973. He ran for deputy for the Third District of Santiago, Puente Alto, in the 1973 parliamentary election but was unsuccessful. He served as Political Advisor to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Diplomatic Academy of Chile in 1973.

===Exile in Mexico===
Following the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, Insulza was prohibited from re-entering Chile (he had been at an international conference in Paris at the time). He spent the next 15 years in exile, living first in Rome, Italy from 1974 to 1981 and then in Mexico from 1981 to 1988. There, he worked as a researcher, eventually becoming the Director of the United States Studies Institute at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE). He also taught at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Universidad Iberoamericana, and the Diplomatic Studies Institute. He has written numerous publications in his field.

He joined the Socialist Party of Chile in 1985.

===Return to Chile===
Insulza returned to Chile in early 1988 and joined the &quot;Concertación&quot; coalition of left-leaning political parties as a member of the Socialist Party. Following the end of military rule, Insulza was appointed Chilean Ambassador for International Cooperation in 1990. He became Director of Multilateral Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Vice President of the International Cooperation Agency (AGCI) some time later. He became a member of the Chilean Association of Political Science, the Bar Association, and the Chilean Council of International Relations.

On March 11, 1994, Insulza became Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs under president Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle. On September 20, 1994, he rose to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. On June 22, 1999, he became Minister Secretary-General of the Presidency. On March 11, 2000, he took office as Minister of the Interior under president Ricardo Lagos.

===Secretary General of the Organization of American States===
Insulza was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States on May 2, 2005, following Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Ernesto Derbez&#x27;s withdrawal from the race. (&quot;See&quot; 2005 Organization of American States Secretary General election.)

On January 5, 2007, Insulza criticized Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez&#x27;s decision not to renew television channel RCTV&#x27;s broadcast license (Chávez had accused the station of being a coup d&#x27;état instigator.) Three days later, Chávez responded to Insulza by calling for his resignation and referring to him as a &quot;pendejo&quot;—a Spanish profanity equivalent to &quot;dumbass&quot;. Insulza later received the support of several OAS members, including the US, and Chávez conceded he had gone too far with his words. In April 2008, Chávez congratulated Insulza for stating in a presentation before the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere that there was no evidence linking Venezuela to terrorist groups.

Insulza openly stated his intention to run for President of Chile, but withdrew from the race on January 5, 2009 and vowed to continue as Secretary General of the OAS until the end of his mandate. He gave his support to Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle as the &quot;Concertación&quot; candidate for president.

On March 24, 2010, Insulza—the sole candidate—was reelected (with the abstention of Bolivia) as OAS chief for another five-year term.

Insulza won the Washington Office on Latin America&#x27;s prestigious Human Rights Award in 2008. In 2014 Insulza was awarded the prestigious Kalman H. Silvert Award presented by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.

====Criticism====
As Secretary General, Insulza was criticized for not taking enough action against human rights abuses in the Americas. In 2008, the Human Rights Foundation started the &quot;Inter-American Democratic Charter and Mr. Insulza&quot; program, to inform Insulza every month of human rights abuses taking place in the Americas.

==Later career==
In 2019, Insulza joined the inaugural meeting of the so-called Puebla Group in Buenos Aires, a conference of left-leaning political leaders.

<text>Jeffrey Daniel Whitty (born September 30, 1971) is an American playwright, actor, and screenwriter.

For the stage musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, he won the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical.

For his work on the Fox Searchlight film &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot; (2018), he was nominated for the BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and won numerous awards including the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay, AARP&#x27;s Movies for Grownups, the Satellite Awards, and the Film Independent Spirit Awards.

&quot;Avenue Q&quot; was his first produced musical and &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me&quot; his first produced screenplay.

==Early life and education==
Whitty was born September 30, 1971, in Coos Bay, Oregon, where he was raised as the fifth of six children. After graduating from the University of Oregon in 1993, he moved to New York City and received a master&#x27;s degree from New York University&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program in 1997. After two decades in New York he moved to Los Angeles in 2013.

==Career==
He won the 2004 Tony Award for Best Book of a musical for &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, written with composers Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, which opened at Broadway&#x27;s John Golden Theatre in 2003 and ran commercially in New York City for sixteen years. Among dozens of international productions and two national tours, the musical ran for six years on London&#x27;s West End, as produced by Cameron Mackintosh.

Whitty wrote the libretto to the musical adaptation of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the City&quot; novels, with music by Jake Shears and John Garden of the musical group Scissor Sisters. The musical was workshopped at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s 2009 National Music Theater Conference. It opened in a limited run at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco on May 18, 2011, and, after extending twice, closed on July 10. It was directed by Jason Moore with a cast that featured Judy Kaye, Betsy Wolfe, Mary Birdsong and Wesley Taylor. Whitty won the 2011 Bay Area Critics Circle award for his work.

Whitty wrote the libretto for &quot;Bring It On: The Musical&quot;, a &quot;free adaptation&quot; of the popular film series with an original story by Whitty, with music by Tom Kitt and Lin-Manuel Miranda and lyrics by Amanda Green and Miranda. Direction was by Andy Blankenbuehler with music direction by Alex Lacamoire. The musical premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on January 16, 2011. The musical subsequently went on a multi-city national tour beginning at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles on October 30, 2011. A revised version opened for a limited run at Broadway&#x27;s St. James Theatre on August 1, 2012, and was nominated for the 2013 Tony Award for Best Musical.

In 2015, Whitty premiered his original vision of &quot;Head Over Heels (musical)&quot; at the outdoor 1100-seat Allen Elizabethan Theatre at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. His co-writer and music supervisor was Carmel Dean. Whitty devised the jukebox musical as a hybrid of Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia and the back catalog of 80&#x27;s pop stars The Go-Go&#x27;s. After it opened on June 13, Whitty&#x27;s version of the musical sold out its five-month run within two weeks. New York Times drama critic Charles Isherwood praised Whitty&#x27;s book as &quot;deliciously witty, bawdy and full of loopy appeal — and written mostly in skillfully wrought iambic pentameter yet.&quot;

In 2016, Whitty left the production when director Michael Mayer took over directing duties, installing Tom Kitt as music supervisor and firing all of Whitty&#x27;s collaborators. A statement from the producers read: “Jeff Whitty’s original book was tied to specific language and arrangements of the Go-Go’s music. Incoming director Michael Mayer had a different vision for ‘Head Over Heels’ and Whitty chose to leave the production. All concerned wish one another success in their future endeavors.” Mayer and Kitt&#x27;s quite different version of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; opened at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, bound for a Broadway run that opened July 26th, 2018, with a script &quot;substantially revised&quot; by James MacGruder. In March 2023, Whitty published an essay entitled &quot;Grand Theft Musical&quot; alleging severe mistreatment on the part of the producers of &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, his agent, and his lawyer, including—variously—exploitation, threats, harassment, and theft of royalties.

In 2018, Fox Searchlight Pictures released &quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me&quot;, with a screenplay by Whitty and Nicole Holofcener, adapted from a memoir by Lee Israel. The film was directed by Marielle Heller and starred Melissa McCarthy as Israel and Richard E. Grant as Jack Hock, Israel&#x27;s accomplice. The movie, its creative team and cast won a multitude of awards, with Whitty and Holofcener&#x27;s screenplay garnering awards from the Writers Guild of America, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Satellite Press Association, the Los Angeles Critic Circle and many more, as well as BAFTA and Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Whitty&#x27;s plays include &quot;The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler&quot; which was commissioned by and received its world premiere at South Coast Repertory in January, 2006; &quot;The Plank Project&quot; (a parody of documentary theater pieces like &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;); the multi-play cycle &quot;Balls&quot;; &quot;The Hiding Place,&quot; a romantic Manhattan comedy which received its New York debut at the Atlantic Theater Company; the dark comedy &quot;Suicide Weather.&quot;

Whitty is an occasional actor, having appeared in New York productions of plays by Amy Freed, including &quot;The Beard of Avon&quot; and &quot;Freedomland&quot;, as well as small roles in the films Garmento, Lisa Picard is Famous, and a cameo in &quot;Shortbus&quot;. Among his theatrical credits include stints at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, Philadelphia Theatre Company, and Playwrights Horizons and New York Theatre Workshop in New York City. In 2012 for a 25-performance run he played the title role in his own &quot;The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler&quot; in a production by New York company Exit, Pursued by a Bear, with Billy Porter playing the co-leading role of Mammy. Both roles had been created for and played by women until this production.

== Personal life ==
His older brother George Whitty is a noted jazz musician and producer, and the winner of multiple Grammy and Emmy Awards.

Jeff Whitty now lives on Cape Cod.

<text>The Tristia (&quot;Sad things&quot; or &quot;Sorrows&quot;) is a collection of poems written in elegiac couplets by the Augustan poet Ovid during the first three years following his banishment from Rome to Tomis on the Black Sea in AD 8. Despite five books in which he bewails his fate copiously, the immediate cause of Augustus&#x27; banishment of the most acclaimed living Latin poet to Pontus remains a mystery. In addition to the &quot;Tristia&quot;, Ovid wrote another collection of elegiac epistles on his exile, the &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;, as well as a 642-line curse poem called &quot;Ibis&quot;, directed against the unnamed enemy who had apparently caused his downfall. He spent several years in the outpost of Tomis and died in AD 17 or 18 without ever returning to Rome.

The &quot;Tristia&quot; was once viewed unfavorably in Ovid&#x27;s oeuvre but has become the subject of scholarly interest in recent years.

==The poems==

The first of the five books was written during Ovid&#x27;s journey into exile. It addresses his grieving wife, his friends — both the faithful and the false — and his past works, especially the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Ovid describes his arduous travel to the furthest edge of the empire, giving him a chance to draw parallels with the exiles of Aeneas and Odysseus (Ulysses) and excuse his work&#x27;s failings. The introductory poem, which cautions the departing book against the dangers of its destination, was probably written last.

The second book consists of a single 578-line poem. It takes the form of a plea to Augustus to end the unhappy exile brought about by his (poem and error). The poem which had angered the Emperor was apparently Ovid&#x27;s , a light-hearted instruction manual on how to pick up women; the nature of the &quot;error&quot; is never made clear, although some speculate it may have had something to do with Ovid&#x27;s overhearing (or rather discovery) of the adulterous nature of Augustus&#x27; daughter, Julia. He defends his work and his life with equal vigor, appealing to the many poets who had written on the same themes as he—among them Anacreon, Sappho, Catullus and even Homer.

The plea was unsuccessful; Ovid would live out the remainder of his years in exile among the Thracian Getae. The last three books of the &quot;Tristia&quot; grow grimmer as their author ages, heavy with the knowledge that he will never return to his home. At one point he even composes his epitaph:

The last poem of book 5 addresses Ovid&#x27;s wife, praising her loyalty throughout his years of exile and wishing that she be remembered for as long as his books are read.

The number of poems in differs slightly in different editions. For example, in Hall&#x27;s 1995 Teubner edition, poems 1.5, 1.9, 3.4, 4.4, 5.2 and 5.7 are each split into two separate poems, which in most manuscripts each appear to be a single poem. Taking this division into account, book 1 has 13 poems, book 3 has 15, book 4 has 11, book 5 has 16. Book 2, as noted above, is one single poem.

==Critical reception==
Peter Green wrote in a translation of Ovid&#x27;s exile poems that the &quot;Tristia&quot; &quot;[has] not, on the whole, had a good press from posterity.&quot; Gordon Williams referred to the work as &quot;mostly a pale reflection of the genius that he had been.&quot; However, Ralph J. Hexter wrote in 1995 that literary critics were then &quot;beginning to give the exile elegies a fresh look.&quot; A number of scholars have since viewed the collection favorably. It is listed among Ovid&#x27;s major works by author David Malouf and scholar Matthew Woodcock. In Matthew Bunson&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire&quot;, it is called &quot;a powerful plea for justice.&quot;

<doc id="1261522" wikidata="Q1111648" url="?curid=1261522" title="Colorist">
<text>In comics, a colorist is responsible for adding color to black-and-white line art. For most of the 20th century this was done using brushes and dyes which were then used as guides to produce the printing plates. Since the late 20th century it is most often done using digital media, with printing separations produced electronically.

Although most American colorists work directly for comics publishers (either as employees or freelancers), there are a few coloring studios which offer their services to publishers. American Color, Olyoptics, Digital Chameleon were the companies notable in this field.

== History ==
Originally, comics were colored by cutting out films of various densities in the appropriate shapes to be used in producing color-separated printing plates. The typical colorist worked from photocopies of the inked pages, which they colored with special dyes. Dr. Martin&#x27;s Dyes was a brand notable in this field within the comic strip industry. CMYK codes were written on the page to indicate the final printed colors, and these hand-colored pages were used as guides by the engraver. Tatjana Wood was the main colorist for DC Comics&#x27; covers from 1973 through the mid-1980s.

More recently, colorists have worked in transparent media such as watercolors or airbrush, which is then photographed, allowing more subtle and painterly effects.

==Digital color==
Colorist Steve Oliff and his company Olyoptics were one of the first to use computers to do color separations. Although other companies at the time were experimenting with computers, Oliff and his crew were the first to blend the color guide artist with the separator. In 1987, the Japanese manga &quot;Akira&quot; was in preparation to be translated and published by Marvel Comics&#x27;s Epic Comics line. Oliff was chosen as the colorist, and he convinced Marvel that it was time to try computer color. After the publication of &quot;Akira&quot; in 1988, computer coloring became increasingly prevalent in the comics industry.

By the early 1990s, even though the larger comics publishers were using computers, there were variations within the field. DC Comics allowed only a 64-color palette, while Marvel had expanded it to 125 colors. Dark Horse Comics allowed even more variations. The dominant programs in use during that time were Color Prep and Tint Prep, both originally implemented by Olyoptics. This software was invented and written by &quot;Pixel Craft&quot;, the first company to create software that used a personal computer that could output files for a digital image setter to make negatives for color printing. Pixel craft was a small company in Long Island, New York, created by Kenneth Giordano and Khouri Giordano. The father and son team went on to accomplish many first in the computerization of color print. In 1993, Image Comics&#x27; use of computer color and more advanced color separation technology propelled DC and Marvel to further upgrade their coloring techniques. Finally, in the mid-1990s, Digital Chameleon&#x27;s facility with Adobe Photoshop helped make that program the industry standard.

The improvements in the technology used for coloring have had a great impact on the way comics are drawn. Before the use of computers, artists would often use the pen or brush to put in detailed shading effects; now the artist is more likely to leave the drawing open and leave it to the colorist to insert shading through variation in color tones or through adding a layer of translucent black. Most contemporary colorists work in digital media using tools.

<doc id="1261524" wikidata="Q113189" url="?curid=1261524" title="Let's Dance (David Bowie album)">
<text>Let&#x27;s Dance is the fifteenth studio album by the English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 14 April 1983 through EMI America Records. Co-produced by Bowie and Nile Rodgers, the album was recorded in December 1982 at the Power Station in New York City. The sessions featured players from Rodgers&#x27; band Chic and the then-unknown Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan on lead guitar. For the first time on an album, Bowie only sang and played no instruments.

Musically, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; has been described as a post-disco record, with elements of dance-rock, dance-pop and new wave. The album contains two cover songs: Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;China Girl&quot;, which Bowie and Pop had recorded together for the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1977), and Metro&#x27;s &quot;Criminal World&quot;. It also includes a reworking of &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot;, originally recorded by Bowie and Giorgio Moroder in 1982 for the film of the same name.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was released to massive commercial success, reaching number one in numerous countries, and turned Bowie into a major superstar; it remains Bowie&#x27;s best-selling album. The record&#x27;s four singles, including the title track, were all commercially successful. The album received mixed reviews from critics whose opinions on the artistic content varied. &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot; were supported by music videos that received heavy airplay on MTV. It was supported by the successful Serious Moonlight Tour throughout 1983.

Despite the album&#x27;s success, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; began a period of low creativity for Bowie. He felt that he had to pander his music to his newly acquired audience, which led to his follow-up albums, &quot;Tonight&quot; (1984) and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987), being critically dismissed. He later reflected poorly on the period, referring to it as his &quot;Phil Collins years&quot;. The album was remastered in 2018 and included in the box set &quot;Loving the Alien (1983–1988)&quot;.

==Background==
David Bowie released his 14th studio album &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; in 1980. With the record, Bowie achieved what biographer David Buckley calls &quot;the perfect balance&quot; of creativity and mainstream success. Following the sessions, Bowie portrayed the lead role of Joseph &quot;John&quot; Merrick in the Broadway play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; between late July 1980 and early January 1981. During this time, he also filmed an appearance in the Uli Edel film &quot;Christiane F.&quot; (1981).

The murder of John Lennon in December 1980 affected Bowie deeply; he cancelled an upcoming &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; tour and withdrew to his home in Switzerland, becoming a recluse but continuing to work. In July 1981, he collaborated with Giorgio Moroder for &quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot;, the title song of the Paul Schrader film &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982), and in the same session, recorded &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with the rock band Queen. Shortly after, he played the title role in a BBC adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Baal&quot;, directed by Alan Clarke. Recorded in August 1981 and transmitted in March 1982, Bowie also recorded an accompanying soundtrack EP, released through RCA in February to coincide with the transmission. During the year, Bowie filmed appearances in &quot;The Hunger&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, both released in 1983. During filming for the latter, he grew fond of artists from the 1950s and 1960s, including James Brown, Buddy Guy, Elmore James and Albert King. The musical ideals from these artists would greatly influence the new album.

&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s final studio album for RCA Records, his label since &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971). Having grown increasingly dissatisfied with the label, who he felt was &quot;milking&quot; his back catalogue, he was also eager for the September 1982 expiration of his 1975 severance settlement with his old manager Tony Defries. Although RCA was willing to re-sign, alongside Columbia and Geffen Records, Bowie signed a new contract with EMI America Records for an estimated $17 million.

==Development==

With a new label and an idea for a commercial sound, Bowie wanted to begin fresh with a new producer. He chose Nile Rodgers of the R&amp;B band Chic, one of the most commercially successful bands of the late 1970s, with hits such as &quot;Le Freak&quot; (1978) and &quot;Good Times&quot; (1979). According to biographer Nicholas Pegg, contemporary listeners considered Rodgers&#x27; writing and production work, including Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot; (1979) and Diana Ross&#x27;s &quot;Upside Down&quot; (1980), to be &quot;dance classics&quot;. Bowie and Rodgers met each other at the Continental in New York City in autumn 1982, where they found they had similar influences in old blues and R&amp;B music. Speaking to &quot;Musician&quot; in 1983, Rodgers said: &quot;David could have had any producer – white or black – he wanted. He could have gone with Quincy Jones and a more sure-fire chance at a hit. But he called me up, and for that I feel honoured.&quot;

Tony Visconti, the producer of Bowie&#x27;s last four studio albums, was originally scheduled to produce the new album and set time aside to record. However, Bowie neglected to inform Visconti that he chose Rodgers for the project, the producer eventually learning through Bowie&#x27;s assistant Coco Schwab closer to December 1982. Deeply hurt, the move damaged the two men&#x27;s relationship and Visconti did not work with Bowie on a studio album again until 2002&#x27;s &quot;Heathen&quot;, nearly 20 years later. In a 2023 interview with &quot;SuperDeluxeEdition&quot;, Visconti stated that in hindsight, he believed Bowie was right to seek out a new producer given his desire for commercial success, drawing comparisons with his own work with other artists in-between Bowie projects.

Bowie and Rodgers regrouped at the latter&#x27;s home in Montreux, Switzerland, to begin demo work. The producer, who was expecting to make &quot;Scary Monsters 2&quot;, was surprised to learn Bowie had a different idea, saying &quot;&#x27;Nile, I really want you to make hits.&#x27; And I was sort of taken aback, because I&#x27;d always assumed that David Bowie did art first, and then if it happened to become a hit, so be it!&quot; The producer was initially disappointed he would not be able to use the record as a way to earn respect from white audiences, but knew he would do what he did best in order to guarantee a hit. Bowie played his new songs on a twelve-string acoustic guitar, starting with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; in a soft vocal arrangement. Rodgers knew it was not a dance song, but took old &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s records to arrange the track into the finished product. Over three days, the two demoed the new tracks, with assistance from the Turkish multi-instrumentalist Erdal Kızılçay, who would later become a frequent collaborator of Bowie&#x27;s.

==Recording==

&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was recorded at the Power Station in New York City (where Bowie had also recorded &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;) during the first three weeks of December 1982, and was completed in 17 days. The engineer for the sessions was Bob Clearmountain. Rodgers felt that the record&#x27;s sound was aided by the ambience of the studio: &quot;The Power Station is famous for its great drum sound. And we had great players too.&quot; Along with a new producer, an entirely new set of musicians were hired for the record, with Bowie stating: &quot;I wanted to have a little relief from the guys that I usually work with. I wanted to try people that I&#x27;d never worked with before, so that I couldn&#x27;t predict how they were going to play.&quot; Long-time collaborator Carlos Alomar, who had worked with Bowie since the mid-1970s and would continue to work with Bowie into the mid-1990s, was originally scheduled to contribute, but claimed he was offered an &quot;embarrassing&quot; fee and declined. In 1984, Alomar clarified he did not play on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; because he was only given two weeks&#x27; notice and was already booked with other work.

With Alomar gone, Rodgers took his place on rhythm guitar. The producer also recruited his regular Chic collaborators: keyboardist Robert Sabino, percussionist Sammy Figueroa and backing vocalists Frank and George Simms. The remaining musicians included drummer Omar Hakim (whom Bowie called &quot;a fascinating drummer with impeccable timing&quot;); bassist Carmine Rojas; trumpeter Mac Gollehon; and saxophonists Stan Harrison, Robert Aaron and Steve Elson. Near the end of the sessions, Rodgers hired Chic drummer Tony Thompson and bassist Bernard Edwards for additional work; he was reluctant to hire them earlier due to their past drug use. Due to their arrival time, Thompson and Edwards&#x27; contributions were limited, appearing on only three tracks and one track, respectively. Edwards recorded his part for &quot;Without You&quot; in 13 minutes, with Rodgers later writing in his memoir, &quot;I was never more proud of him in my life and it happened on the last day of basic recording.&quot; For the first time ever, Bowie himself played no instruments on the album, stating at the time: &quot;I don&#x27;t play a damned thing. This was a singer&#x27;s album.&quot; He recorded all of his vocals in two days.
At the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, Bowie saw Stevie Ray Vaughan play guitar. At the time, Vaughan was an unknown 28-year-old blues guitarist from Texas; his debut album with his band Double Trouble was still unreleased. After Vaughan&#x27;s performance, Bowie was so impressed that he tracked him down months later to get him to play lead guitar on the album. Rodgers was initially unimpressed with Vaughan, believing he sounded like American blues guitarist Albert King. Bowie however felt Vaughan was different, saying &quot;he&#x27;s got a whole other thing going on.&quot; Vaughan recorded his guitar overdubs towards the end of the sessions. According to author Paul Trynka, he used an old Fender Stratocaster plugged into an old Fender amplifier, &quot;all the tone coming from the player&quot;. In a contemporary interview, Vaughan described the recording sessions: &quot;Bowie is real easy to work with. He knows what he&#x27;s doing in the studio and he doesn&#x27;t mess around... He&#x27;d give his opinion on the stuff he liked and the stuff that needed work. Almost everything was cut in one or two takes. I think there was only one thing that needed three takes.&quot; According to Vaughan&#x27;s biographers Joe Patoski and Bill Crawford, Vaughan played on six of the album&#x27;s eight songs. In the biography &quot;Strange Fascination&quot;, Buckley found Vaughan to be a &quot;bizarre&quot; choice for lead guitarist, as at the time, he was &quot;about as far away from Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew as you could get&quot;. Bowie and Rodgers praised Vaughan&#x27;s work on the album, with the latter becoming one of Vaughan&#x27;s closest friends after the sessions.

After the sessions concluded, Bowie went on holiday in Mexico, before returning to New York to finish post-production work and close his deal with EMI America at the end of January 1983. Upon closure, Bowie delivered &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; to the label and departed for Australia to film music videos for the first two singles.

==Songs==
Commentators characterise the songs on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; as post-disco, dance, dance-rock, new wave and dance-pop. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; calls the record &quot;the sound in favour of pure disco, dance, and funk with Bowie coming down to earth&quot; and that Bowie built upon the post-punk and new wave sound of its predecessor. The author James E. Perone notes the blues-edge inflicted by Vaughan, praising his contributions on &quot;Modern Love&quot;, &quot;China Girl&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Details&quot; magazine in 1991, Bowie described the album as &quot;a rediscovery of white-English-ex-art-school-student-meets-black-American-funk, a refocusing of &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975)&quot;. The artist Tanja Stark sees the commercial tempo of the album masking the lyrical continuity of Bowie&#x27;s ongoing narratives of spiritual struggle and death anxieties.

===Side one===
The opening track, &quot;Modern Love&quot;, is an uptempo pop song that features a call-and-response structure inspired by Little Richard. AllMusic&#x27;s Dave Thompson calls it &quot;[a] high-energy, effervescent rocker&quot; that &quot;epitomises all that was good about Bowie&#x27;s 1983 reinvention as a willing superstar&quot;. Pegg praises the music but calls the lyrics &quot;superficial&quot; compared to Bowie&#x27;s previous work, as does Perone, who comments &quot;some of the lyrics are clearer than others&quot;. O&#x27;Leary compares the lyrics to a flowchart, moving from &quot;modern love&quot; to &quot;church on time&quot; to &quot;God and man&quot;.

&quot;China Girl&quot; was written by Bowie and Iggy Pop in 1976, first appearing on Pop&#x27;s 1977 debut solo album &quot;The Idiot&quot;, which Bowie himself co-wrote and produced. Buckley calls Bowie&#x27;s version an &quot;ultra-cool reading&quot; of Pop&#x27;s original. For his version, Bowie added backing vocals while Rodgers composed the guitar riff. O&#x27;Leary writes that Bowie&#x27;s vocal is more &quot;playful&quot; than Pop&#x27;s, with the music itself exhibiting &quot;Asian&quot; qualities. BBC Online reviewer David Quantick acknowledged the effect of Rodgers&#x27; production on the song, arguing that &quot;nobody but Rodgers could have taken a song like &#x27;China Girl&#x27;, with its paranoid references to &#x27;visions of swastikas&#x27;, and turned it into a sweet, romantic hit single&quot;. Pegg calls Bowie&#x27;s rendition &quot;a tremendously effective slice of hardcore pop&quot;, commenting that the lyrics reflect the album&#x27;s overarching themes of &quot;cultural identity&quot; and &quot;desperate love&quot;.

Pegg considers the title track to be one of Bowie&#x27;s finest 1980s recordings and one of the &quot;all-time great pop songs.&quot; It was described by Ed Power in the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; as &quot;a decent chunk of funk-rock&quot;; Perone finds that it represents the contemporary dance craze of the 1980s. It opens with a group of singers getting louder and louder before it explodes into a massive climax. O&#x27;Leary and Pegg compare the intro to the Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; (1963). The seven-minute album version features different instrumental solos than the shorter single version. The lyrics instruct the listener to &quot;put on your red shoes&quot; and dance under the &quot;serious moonlight&quot;.

&quot;Without You&quot; harkens back to Bowie&#x27;s 1960s recordings, reflecting 1960s-style pop. Pegg considers it a &quot;throwaway love song&quot; and the album&#x27;s low point, disregarding both the music and lyrics. O&#x27;Leary similarly criticises Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance, done in a &quot;fragile falsetto&quot;. On the other hand, Ken Tucker of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Without You&quot; featured some of the most daring songwriting of Bowie&#x27;s career and complimented his vocal performance.

===Side two===
Biographers found &quot;Ricochet&quot; the only track reminiscent of the experimental nature of Bowie&#x27;s late-1970s recordings. Perone finds it out of place with the rest of the album and suggests the artist was entering an artistic low point. Pegg writes that it has an R&amp;B and swing-style repetitive backing vocal. Describing the track in 1987, Bowie stated: &quot;I thought it was a great song, and the beat wasn&#x27;t quite right. It didn&#x27;t roll the way it should have, the syncopation was wrong. It had an ungainly gait; it should have flowed. ... Nile did his own thing to it, but it wasn&#x27;t quite what I&#x27;d had in mind when I wrote the thing.&quot;

&quot;Criminal World&quot; was originally written and recorded by Metro in 1977, but their version was banned by the BBC for its bisexual undertones. O&#x27;Leary states that Bowie included it on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; as a way to &quot;sneak a transgressive song onto a platinum record&quot;. Pegg writes that Bowie updated its sound to match &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, featuring a new wave and pop reggae groove, and calls Vaughan&#x27;s guitar solo his finest on the record. Both Buckley and O&#x27;Leary praise Bowie&#x27;s rendition as a strong cover.

&quot;Cat People (Putting Out Fire)&quot; was recorded in 1981 by Bowie and Giorgio Moroder as the theme song for the 1982 film &quot;Cat People&quot;. Bowie was unhappy with the original version and asked Rodgers to remake it for &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. O&#x27;Leary describes the remake as &quot;more aggressive&quot;. He praises Vaughan&#x27;s guitar solo as superior to the original, but criticises Bowie&#x27;s vocals as inferior. Pegg also considers the &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; version to be inferior and laments that the remake became the better known version.

The album ends with &quot;Shake It&quot;, which Pegg calls &quot;a likable enough piece of fluff&quot;. O&#x27;Leary describes the track as a summary of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;bad habits&quot; of the 1980s: &quot;an indifference to quality&quot;. Biographer Marc Spitz writes that its sound is a precursor to U2&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;Lemon&quot;.

==Release==
===Music videos===
After delivering the album to the label, Bowie travelled to Australia in February 1983 to film the music videos for the first two singles, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot;. He directed the video for &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; with David Mallet, the director of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Lodger&quot; and &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; videos. The video has nothing to do with the song itself, except for a brief glimpse of red shoes. It follows a young Australian Aboriginal couple doing various activities that seduce them to the commercialism of white urban Australia. Bowie appears and sings the lyrics into the camera. The video is an allegory meant to represent the treatment of Aboriginals by white Australian capitalists. The video for &quot;China Girl&quot;, again directed by Mallet, is similar in its theme of clashing perspectives, juxtaposing Sydney executives against the city&#x27;s Chinese population. It features New Zealand actress Geeling Ng who recreates the famous beach scene from &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953) with Bowie. Buckley says that the provocative allegories and scenes of the videos guaranteed heavy rotation on MTV.

===Singles===
&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was released through EMI America in edited form as the lead single on 14 March 1983, with the remake of &quot;Cat People&quot; as the B-side. Three days later, Bowie held a press conference in London where he announced the new album, also titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, the new label and the upcoming tour. He donned a new look, featuring bleached blonde hair and a white suit. A few days later, the &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; video premiered on the UK rock show &quot;The Tube&quot;, along with interviews by Jools Holland. By the following week, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number five, before peaking at number one for three weeks, and remaining on the chart for 14 weeks. It further peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April, becoming Bowie&#x27;s biggest charting single to date. According to Buckley, the single was played &quot;endlessly&quot; on UK radio stations.

EMI America issued &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; on 14 April 1983, with the catalogue number AML 3029. Its cover artwork, depicting Bowie shadow-boxing against a city skyline, was taken by photographer Greg Gorman. &quot;China Girl&quot; was released, again in edited form, as the album&#x27;s second single on 31 May, with &quot;Shake It&quot; as the B-side. Although it failed to replicate the success of the title track, it still peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in June, held off the top spot by the Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;. In the US, it peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Modern Love&quot; was released, again in edited form, as the album&#x27;s third single on 12 September 1983. The B-side was a live version, recorded in Montreal on 13 July. Like &quot;China Girl&quot;, &quot;Modern Love&quot; peaked at number two in the UK, held off the top spot by Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;. In the US, it charted at number 14. It was supported by a music video, directed by Jim Yukich, depicting a performance of the song in Philadelphia on 20 July. &quot;Without You&quot; appeared as the fourth and final single in November, backed by &quot;Criminal World&quot;, released only in Holland, Japan, Spain and the US, where it reached number 73.

==Commercial performance==
Upon release, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and stayed there for three weeks. Although &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; (both 1973) and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974) were at the top position longer, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; remained on the chart for over a year. The album peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart on 24 June 1983, and remained on the chart for 69 weeks. EMI declared &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; to be their fastest-selling record since the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). Bowie&#x27;s old label RCA issued a collection of Bowie&#x27;s back catalogue as a way to cash in on its success. All of Bowie&#x27;s albums he released between 1969 and 1974: &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;, as well as &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (both 1977), all began to chart again. By July, Bowie had ten albums in the UK top 100. This feat made Bowie the artist with the second highest number of individual album-weeks of all time – with 198, behind the rock band Dire Straits, who achieved 217 individual album-weeks in 1986.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; has sold 10.7 million copies worldwide, making it Bowie&#x27;s best-selling album.

==Critical reception==

Despite the album&#x27;s major commercial success, it received mixed reviews from music critics, with opinions varying on the artistic content. In &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, David Fricke called it &quot;Bowie at his best&quot;. In a piece on Bowie for &quot;Time&quot; in July 1983, Jay Cocks described the album as &quot;unabashedly commercial, melodically alliterative and lyrically smart at the same time&quot;. Robert Christgau felt that it had a &quot;perfunctory professional surface&quot;, and that other than the &quot;interesting&quot; &quot;Modern Love&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was &quot;pleasantly pointless&quot;. Steve Bush of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; found it overall dull, and Debra Rae Cohen of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most artless&quot; record yet, but one whose familiar dance music is &quot;almost timeless in its appeal&quot;. Tucker felt &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; sounded great, with an intelligent simplicity and a &quot;surface beauty&quot;, but that as a whole it was &quot;thin and niggling&quot;, other than &quot;Modern Love&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Shake It&quot;, which offered &quot;some of the most daring songwriting of Bowie&#x27;s career&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Record&quot; magazine, Carol Cooper called the album &quot;the &quot;Young Americans&quot; of the &#x27;80s&quot; and enjoyed Rodgers&#x27; involvement, writing that his presence allows Bowie to shine through. However, she felt all the tracks were &quot;rather modest&quot;. More positively, &quot;NME&quot;″s Charles Shaar Murray gave unanimous praise to the album, calling it &quot;some of the strongest, simplest and least complicated music that Bowie has ever made.&quot; Further describing it as &quot;warm, strong, inspiring and useful,&quot; he approved of Vaughan&#x27;s contributions, saying he gives the songs a more &quot;traditional&quot; feel. John Walker of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; hailed it as a record that &quot;simply bleaches the competition&quot;, one that represents &quot;the closest Bowie has come to capturing pure energy&quot;. Offering further praise, &quot;Billboard&quot; deemed it &quot;Bowie&#x27;s most accessible music in years&quot;, &quot;Cash Box&quot; hailed it as his &quot;most danceable album to date&quot;, and &quot;Commonweal&quot; called it &quot;some of the most exciting R&amp;B-based dance music in years.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; at number 13 in its end-of-the-year list. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; finished at number 19.

==Tour==
To support &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, Bowie embarked on his first concert tour in five years, the Serious Moonlight Tour, which ran from 18 May to 8 December 1983. Taking its title from a lyric in the title track, rehearsals began in the spring of 1983, with Alomar back as bandleader. The majority of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; musicians returned, with the exception of Vaughan, who was present for rehearsals but let go by Bowie just days before the European leg was scheduled to begin. His dismissal was attributed to his alcohol and drug use, his request that his band Double Trouble be the supporting act, which Bowie denied, and his alleged displeasure to Bowie miming his guitar solo in the &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; video. Vaughan&#x27;s replacement was Diamond Dogs Tour (1974) and &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976) guitarist Earl Slick.

The tour&#x27;s set pieces were created by the Diamond Dogs Tour artist Mark Ravitz. The set, Bowie&#x27;s most elaborate yet, featured structures such as large columns, overhanging lintels and a giant right hand pointed upwards. Compared to prior tours, Serious Moonlight emphasised lights rather than props. Alomar later told Buckley that it was his favourite Bowie tour, mainly because &quot;it was the first tour where we did all the hits&quot;. Discussing the setlist, Pegg states it was &quot;unashamedly a greatest hits package aimed at acquainting the new mass audience with Bowie&#x27;s back catalogue&quot;. Buckley describes the setlist as &quot;relatively mainstream pop-rock&quot;, with none of the &quot;quirks&quot; of the late &#x27;70s tours. Many of the arrangements were redone with horns to make every song sound fresh.

Serious Moonlight was a massive success: it became the biggest tour of 1983, appeased Bowie&#x27;s newfound audience and, along with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, turned Bowie into a massive superstar. The tour was mostly well-received, although British reviewers tended to be more aggressive than American ones. An accompanying film documenting two shows performed on 11 and 12 September 1983 in Vancouver was released in 1984 as &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot;. Although immensely successful, Bowie later called the tour a mixed blessing: &quot;I was something I never wanted to be. I was a well-accepted artist. I had started appealing to people who bought Phil Collins albums.[...] I suddenly didn&#x27;t know my audience and worse, I didn&#x27;t care about them.&quot; Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Bowie found himself in a creative stalemate. Pressure from the label to release a follow-up led him into the studio in the spring of 1984 unprepared. The resulting album, &quot;Tonight&quot;, is considered one of his creative low-points.

== Subsequent events ==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984 but lost to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). Although Bowie had charged Rodgers with making hits for him, Bowie later said in 1997: &quot;At the time, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was not mainstream. It was virtually a new kind of hybrid, using blues-rock guitar against a dance format. There wasn&#x27;t anything else that really quite sounded like that at the time. So, it only seems commercial in hindsight because it sold so many [copies]. It was great in its way, but it put me in a real corner in that it fucked with my integrity.&quot; Two years earlier, he stated he intended for it to be a one-off project only: &quot;I had every intention of continuing to do some unusual material after that. But the success of that record really forced me, in a way, to continue the beast. It was my own doing, of course, but I felt, after a few years, that I had gotten stuck.&quot; Visconti stated in 1985 that &quot;it was an album he had to make&quot;.

The album&#x27;s success caused Bowie to hit a creative low point in his career lasting the next few years. By 1987, Bowie began to distance himself from the record, telling one interviewer that it was &quot;more Nile&#x27;s album than mine&quot;, to which Rodgers disagreed in 1998. After his follow-up albums &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987) were critically dismissed,—Bowie would later dismiss this period as his &quot;Phil Collins years&quot;—he formed the rock band Tin Machine in an effort to regain his artistic vision.

== Legacy ==

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that the album&#x27;s three hit singles were catchy yet distinctive pop songs, while the rest of the album was &quot;unremarkable plastic soul&quot; indicative of Bowie &quot;entering a songwriting slump&quot;. Power wrote that Bowie &quot;pleaded shamelessly for the love of the mass market&quot; with the album. He continued &quot;... the title track was a decent chunk of funk-rock and Bowie did not embarrass himself on the single &#x27;China Girl&#x27;. Otherwise, the record had a great deal in common with Wham! and Phil Collins.&quot; Quantick praised the combination of Bowie and Rodgers as &quot;perfect&quot; on the title track, the &quot;sweet, romantic&quot; rendition of &quot;China Girl&quot; and highlighted &quot;Criminal World&quot;. He stated &quot;&quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; may have had a ground-breaking sound and a popularity that Bowie clearly ached for, but it&#x27;s often a mundane album, as songs like &#x27;Ricochet&#x27; and &#x27;Shake It&#x27; mark time&quot;. He said the album was &quot;literally the template for 80s Bowie – blond, suited and smiling&quot;. Writing in 1995 for the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield sees the album as exemplifying the influence of the New Romantic movement on Bowie. While lauding &quot;Modern Love&quot;, he describes the album&#x27;s other songs as &quot;dodgier&quot; but &quot;good fun&quot;.

In 2014, Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; as &quot;the conclusion of arguably the greatest 14-year run in rock history&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; the same year, Jeremy Allen stated that the album had &quot;spent time in the wilderness, rejected by many because of its 80s production values&quot;, but he added that &quot;a reappraisal was all but inevitable and has coincided with a renaissance in Rodgers&#x27; career and an outpouring of love for the unprecedentedly successful producer/guitarist.&quot; The chief rock and pop critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis, said in his retrospective review of Bowie&#x27;s career in 2016 that &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; &quot;had its moments&quot;, unlike &quot;Tonight&quot;.

Reflecting on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, Pegg agrees with Bowie in that the record was the artist&#x27;s &quot;least challenging&quot; album up to that point. He felt that unlike Bowie&#x27;s Glass Spider Tour and Tin Machine periods, where Bowie was willing to take risks and face criticism head-on, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; plays it safe in every aspect, creating tunes that originally contained &quot;rough edges&quot; that were then &quot;sanded down&quot; and given a &quot;high-gloss finish&quot;. Pegg also notes that the appearance of three covers on the record was evident to Bowie hitting a creative slump. Spitz on the other hand, considers &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; to be &quot;as revolutionary&quot; as &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, &quot;Station to Station&quot; or &quot;Low&quot;. He finds it unfair to call it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;sellout record&quot;, saying it is &quot;every bit as high concept as his canonised seventies efforts&quot;. Although he finds the record&#x27;s first four tracks among the strongest of Bowie&#x27;s entire career, Perone describes &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; as a &quot;double-edged sword&quot;, in that it was commercially successful but artistically, it found Bowie exploring more conventional lyrical themes and accessible music that would hinder his next recordings.

On the album&#x27;s influence, &quot;Billboard&quot; Joe Lynch argued that &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; provided &quot;the template&quot; for alternative dance music &quot;for the next 30 years&quot;. In 1989, the album was ranked number 83 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; at number 296 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 127 in their list of &quot;The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;; Jeremy D. Larson wrote that &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; &quot;sounds anything but dated&quot; and felt it &quot;became a Trojan horse for the world to discover all the many Bowies hiding underneath the blond bouffant and designer suits.&quot;

== Reissues ==
In 1995, Virgin Records rereleased the album on CD with &quot;Under Pressure&quot; as a bonus track. EMI did the second rerelease in 1999 (featuring 24-bit digitally remastered sound and no bonus tracks), followed by another in 2003 as a hybrid stereo SACD/PCM CD.

In 2018, &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; was remastered for the &quot;Loving the Alien (1983–1988)&quot; box set released by Parlophone. It was released in CD, vinyl and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately the following year.

<text>Pin Ups (also referred to as Pinups and Pin-Ups) is the seventh studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 19October 1973 through RCA Records. Devised as a &quot;stop-gap&quot; album to appease his record label, it is a covers album, featuring glam rock and proto-punk versions of songs by 1960s bands who were influential to Bowie as a teenager, including the Pretty Things, the Who, the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd.

The album was recorded from July to August 1973 at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France following the completion of the Ziggy Stardust Tour. It was Bowie&#x27;s final album co-produced with Ken Scott. Two members of the Spiders from Mars backing band contributed, the guitarist Mick Ronson and the bassist Trevor Bolder, while Mick Woodmansey was replaced by Aynsley Dunbar on drums. Following a surprise announcement at the end of the tour that the Spiders were breaking up, tensions were high during the sessions, which was reflected in the tracks. The album cover, featuring Bowie and the 1960s supermodel Twiggy, was taken in Paris and originally intended for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.

Released only six months after &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and preceded by a cover of the Merseys&#x27; song &quot;Sorrow&quot; as the lead single, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; was a commercial success, topping the UK Albums Chart, but received negative reviews from critics, who criticised the songs as generally inferior to the originals. Retrospective reviewers have described it as uneven, while others believe it had a good premise, but suffered from poor execution. Bowie&#x27;s biographers have noted it as an experiment in nostalgia. Some publications have regarded it as one of the best covers albums. It has been reissued numerous times and was remastered in 2015 as part of the box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;.

== Background ==
By 1973, David Bowie was at his commercial peak. At the end of July, five of his six albums were in the top 40 and three were in the top 15. Bowie&#x27;s most recent LP, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, came out in April, but his label, RCA Records, wanted a new album by Christmas. Having just completed the Ziggy Stardust Tour, Bowie was exhausted from the extensive touring schedule. His manager at the time, Tony Defries, was negotiating for larger royalties with Bowie&#x27;s music publisher and recommended he not record any new compositions until negotiations were finished. Although he had intended his next project to be an adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), he devised a record of cover versions as a &quot;stopgap&quot; album.

On the final date of the tour, 3 July, Bowie unexpectedly announced that &quot;this is the last show we&#x27;ll ever do&quot;. The announcement drove a wedge between Bowie and his backing band, the Spiders from Mars – Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Woody Woodmansey (drums) – specifically Bolder and Woodmansey, who were unaware of the announcement in advance. 
The two were also unhappy upon discovering the pianist Mike Garson, who joined the tour after &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, was being paid more than them. Shortly after the tour&#x27;s end, Woodmansey was fired by Garson over a phone call. To record the covers album, Bowie brought back Garson, Ronson and the &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; players Ken Fordham and Geoffrey MacCormack. The session drummer Aynsley Dunbar replaced Woodmansey and Bolder returned after Jack Bruce of the band Cream declined.

== Production ==
=== Composition ===
&quot;Pin Ups&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s tribute to bands that had inspired him as a teenager. Bowie later explained: &quot;These are all bands which I used to go and hear play down the Marquee between 1964 and 1967. I&#x27;ve got all these records back at home.&quot; According to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, he chose the tracks by &quot;going through a stack of 45s in his rooms at the Hyde Park Hotel before leaving for France&quot;. The musician Scott Richardson, a Pretty Things fan, convinced Bowie to cover two of their songs. Other artists selected included the Yardbirds, the Kinks, Pink Floyd and the Who. The final tracklist includes the Pretty Things&#x27; &quot;Rosalyn&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, Them&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, the Mojos&#x27; &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot;, the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; and their rendition of Billy Boy Arnold&#x27;s &quot;I Wish You Would&quot;, the Easybeats&#x27; &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;, the Merseys&#x27; &quot;Sorrow&quot;, the Who&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; and &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot;, and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot;. Bowie had also considered re-recording his 1966 single &quot;The London Boys&quot; but the idea was discarded.

The songs on &quot;Pin Ups&quot; feature the same arrangements as the originals, albeit performed in glam rock and proto-punk styles. Regarding this, Bowie explained: &quot;We just took down the basic chord structures and worked from there... Some of them don&#x27;t even need any working on – like &#x27;Rosalyn&#x27; for example. But most of the arranging I have done by myself and Mick, and Aynsley too.&quot; The author Peter Doggett writes that only two tracks, &quot;I Wish You Would&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, contained varied arrangements from the originals.

=== Recording ===

&quot;Pin Ups&quot; was recorded at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France, in sessions lasting for three weeks from July to August 1973. The venue was chosen after being recommended by Marc Bolan, whose band T. Rex who had just recorded &quot;Tanx&quot; there. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and marked the final collaboration between the two. According to O&#x27;Leary, rehearsing consisted of playing the band the original track a few times before recording began. Tensions were high during the sessions. Bolder, believing he was unwanted, recorded his bass parts quickly and left. Richardson recalled Ronson overworking himself: &quot;He did everything in the studio, he tuned everybody&#x27;s instruments, he worked on all the arrangements... [he had] a tremendous burden on him;&quot; he also grew wary of his future after the collapse of the Spiders. Scott was facing personal issues on top of pressure from his management company to leave over MainMan not paying him royalties, while Bowie had, in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s words, an &quot;increasingly remote and truculent attitude in the studio&quot;.

A version of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; was recorded during the sessions but went unreleased; Bowie donated the backing track to Ronson for his 1975 solo album &quot;Play Don&#x27;t Worry&quot;. The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;God Only Knows&quot; was also attempted during the sessions, but was left abandoned. The sessions were put on hold in mid-July for the recording of the Scottish singer Lulu&#x27;s covers of Bowie&#x27;s tracks &quot;Watch That Man&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. The &quot;Pin Ups&quot; personnel contributed to the recording.

&quot;Pin Ups&quot; was the first of two &quot;1960s nostalgia&quot; albums that Bowie had planned to release. The second would have contained Bowie covering his favourite American artists, but was never recorded. Rumoured tracks to have appeared for the project include the Stooges&#x27; &quot;No Fun&quot;, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s &quot;Summer in the City&quot; and Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Ladytron&quot;. Bowie also considered making a &quot;Pin Ups&quot; sequel: he had compiled a list of songs he wanted to cover, some of which showed up on his later releases of &quot;Heathen&quot; (2002) and &quot;Reality&quot; (2003).

== Artwork and packaging ==

The cover photo for &quot;Pin Ups&quot; reflected the theme of swinging London by featuring the 1960s supermodel Twiggy, who had previously been name-checked on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;″s &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; as &quot;Twig the Wonder Kid&quot;. The photo was taken midway through the recording sessions at a Paris studio by Twiggy&#x27;s then-manager and partner Justin de Villeneuve; he recalled in 2010: &quot;Twiggy and I had first heard David mention her on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;... We loved the album so much I called David and asked him if he would like to do a shoot with Twiggy. He jumped at the idea.&quot; Twiggy recalled in her autobiography &quot;In Black and White&quot; that she was &quot;really quite nervous&quot; meeting Bowie, but &quot;he immediately put me at ease. He was everything I could have hoped for and more&quot;. During the shoot, Bowie and Twiggy had different skin tones, which &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; make-up designer Pierre Laroche balanced out using make-up masks. Twiggy found the final result &quot;enigmatic and strange&quot;, later calling it one of her favourite images and &quot;possibly the most widely distributed photograph ever taken of me&quot;. The photo was originally slated to appear in &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, although they did not want a man appearing on their front cover, so Bowie opted to use it as the album cover instead; de Villeneuve later recalled &quot;Vogue&quot; being infuriated by the decision.

The original LP&#x27;s rear sleeve featured two photos by the photographer Mick Rock, one of a concert shot from the Ziggy tour and another of Bowie wearing a double-breasted suit cradling a saxophone. Bowie wrote in the book &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;: &quot;I chose the performance photos for the back cover as they were favourite Rock shots of mine. I also did the back cover layout with the colour combination of red writing on blue as it again hinted at Sixties psychedelia.&quot; A discarded idea for the sleeve came from photographer Alan Motz, who &quot;wanted to shoot Bowie metamorphosing into an animal&quot;. This idea would be used for Bowie&#x27;s next album, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974).

== Release ==

RCA issued the lead single &quot;Sorrow&quot;, featuring a cover of Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;Amsterdam&quot; as the B-side, on 12 October 1973; it had been delayed from its original release date of 28 September. The single was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for 15 weeks, becoming one of his biggest hits. &quot;Pin Ups&quot; followed suit a week later on 19 October, issued with the catalogue number RS 1003, only six months after his previous album &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. On the album sleeve, Bowie was simply referred to as &quot;Bowie&quot;. In America, the advertising campaign read: &quot;&quot;Pin Ups&quot; means favourites, and these are Bowie&#x27;s favourite songs. It&#x27;s the kind of music your parents will never let you play loud enough!&quot;

The album&#x27;s release coincided with Roxy Music&#x27;s former singer Bryan Ferry&#x27;s covers album &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. As Ferry had recorded his album weeks before Bowie began work on &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, Ferry was annoyed at the perceived copying of his project, calling it a &quot;rip-off&quot;. According to Sandford, he allegedly went to his label Island Records to request they file an injunction to prevent &quot;Pin Ups&quot; from being released before &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. Instead, O&#x27;Leary writes that Bowie phoned Ferry to inform him of &quot;Pin Ups&quot; and requested permission to record a Roxy Music song. Ferry later told biographer David Buckley, &quot;At first I was a bit apprehensive, but Bowie&#x27;s record turned out to be very different. I myself was always very anxious to be different from other people... and to forge my own furrow.&quot; In the event, both albums were released as planned and charted on the same day, 3November 1973.

===Commercial performance===
In the UK, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; came at the height of Bowie&#x27;s popularity there. The album had advance copies of 150,000, which was 50,000 more than &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. Upon release, it spent 39 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number one, remaining there for five weeks, matching the performance of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six. In the US, the album peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and remained on the chart for 21 weeks. O&#x27;Leary writes that &quot;Pin Ups&quot; was essentially a &quot;new Bowie album&quot; in America since only three of the original tracks that were released as singles had reached the top 40. 

&quot;Pin Ups&quot; was also a commercial success elsewhere. It topped the Sverigetopplistan chart in Sweden, and reached number three in Spain, four in Australia and Finland, six in Brazil and the Netherlands, seven in Italy, and eight in Norway and Yugoslavia. Sandford writes that by Christmas 1973, the album was selling 30,000 copies a week. Upon release of the massive commercially successful &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983), &quot;Pin Ups&quot; returned to the UK chart again, peaking at number 57.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Pin Ups&quot; received primarily negative reviews from music critics on release, with many criticising the songs as generally inferior to their original counterparts. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greg Shaw believed that all the tracks were underproduced and Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance was the album&#x27;s &quot;true failure&quot;, further saying his &quot;excessively mannered voice&quot; was &quot;a ridiculously weak mismatch for the material&quot; and that they were mixed too high to give the tracks the &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;punch&quot; they need to be effective. He concludes his review by saying, &quot;While &quot;Pin Ups&quot; may be a failure, it is also a collection of great songs, most of which are given a more than adequate, and always loving, treatment. Maybe the fairest conclusion to draw is that Bowie can&#x27;t sing any other way, did the best he could, and the result isn&#x27;t all that bad.&quot; In the &quot;NME&quot;, Ian MacDonald felt that by not differentiating the songs from the originals, the renditions lack value, ultimately stating the record failed to live up to expectations and predicted that &quot;unless he puts a banger under his own behind, I can foresee nothing but artistic frustration for Bowie in the next few years.&quot; Loraine Alterman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also negative, saying the album &quot;suffers from too much style and technique and not enough musical substance&quot;.

Discussing &quot;Pin Ups&quot; as a whole, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; found the album &quot;unsatisfying, too cluttered musically and over-produced&quot;. A writer for &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine also reacted negatively, declaring that Bowie &quot;used R&amp;B as a prop, not a springboard&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot;, veteran critic Robert Christgau found the idea of the record good, but its overall execution subpar. On the other hand, &quot;Billboard&quot; responded positively, stating that, &quot;there&#x27;s humor in this music if you want to take it as a look back in musical time.&quot; Robert Hilburn was also positive in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Describing it as a &quot;light, unpretentious, high-spirited album&quot;, he hailed &quot;Pin Ups&quot; as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most inviting albums&quot; and one that deserves special attention.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Pin Ups&quot; continues to receive mixed-to-negative reactions in later decades. When reviewing the album as part of the 2015 box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Douglas Wolk was unfavorable. He cited sloppy execution and the overall idea &quot;more interesting in theory&quot;, believing that all the originals were &quot;vastly&quot; superior and Bowie added nothing interesting to any of them. He further believed that it didn&#x27;t help that the Spiders from Mars were falling apart when recording it. Bruce Eder of AllMusic similarly found the album to be out of place with Bowie&#x27;s output up to that point. He continued, &quot;&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; had established Bowie as perhaps the most fiercely original of all England&#x27;s glam rockers, so an album of covers didn&#x27;t make any sense and was especially confusing for American fans,&quot; further criticising the song choices as unknown. Eder did praise Bowie&#x27;s cover of &quot;Sorrow&quot; as a &quot;distinct improvement&quot; over the original. More positively, Dave Thompson called &quot;Pin Ups&quot; &quot;the underrated classic in David Bowie’s glam-era crown&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers have given &quot;Pin Ups&quot; mixed reactions. Buckley describes it as &quot;uneven but beloved by many&quot;. O&#x27;Leary attributes its &quot;scattershot feel&quot; and &quot;lack of a coherent style&quot; to the dysfunctional nature of its recording, while Sandford acknowledges the album&#x27;s lack of originality in the song arrangements. Doggett calls &quot;Pin Ups&quot; &quot;an exercise in Pop Art&quot;, meaning it was &quot;a reproduction and interpretation of work by [another artist], intended for a mass audience&quot;. James E. Perone, on the other hand, argues that &quot;Pin Ups&quot; predated the release of covers album by other English artists, such as John Lennon with &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1975) and Elvis Costello with &quot;Almost Blue&quot; (1981) and &quot;Kojak Variety&quot; (1995). Perone also recognises the album&#x27;s musical influence, stating that Bowie&#x27;s version of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; was a forerunner in the post-punk and new wave sound of the late 1970s and early 1980s, presaging songs such as Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; (1983). He contests that &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; foreshadowed the soul oriented directions of &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975) and &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976), while &quot;See Emily Play&quot; evokes the avant-garde experimentations of Bowie&#x27;s late 1970s Berlin Trilogy.
Some biographers have analysed the album as an experiment in nostalgia, which Doggett states &quot;was already emerging as one of the dominant themes of the early seventies&quot;. Pegg writes that &quot;it remains perhaps glam rock&#x27;s most cogent expression of its own inherent nostalgia, an affectionate reminder of the process that had led to the charts of 1973.&quot; Buckley states that the album &quot;began an era of pop archeology&quot; and that it &quot;came at a time of uncertainty, a time when many cast backward glances as pop entered its first retroactive phase&quot;. In the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, the critic Rob Sheffield agreed, characterising the album&#x27;s &quot;Swinging London oldies&quot; as &quot;atrophied nostalgia&quot;.

In 2013, in a ranking of Bowie&#x27;s albums up to that point, Gabriela Claymore of &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed &quot;Pin Ups&quot; at number 18 (out of 25), calling it &quot;The only one of Bowie&#x27;s &#x27;70s records you can safely call &#x27;inessential&#x27;. She felt it was out of place coming off of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, but stated, &quot;For what it is, it&#x27;s quite good&quot;. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; ranked all of his 26 studio albums from worst to best, placing &quot;Pin Ups&quot; at number 21. He praised the song choices as &quot;excellent&quot;, describing &quot;Sorrow&quot; as the highlight. However, he found that Bowie went &quot;way, way, way over the top&quot; on every other track. He concluded by stating: &quot;In spite of all the effort, &quot;Pin Ups&quot; remains a slight affair.&quot; In the context of Bowie&#x27;s entire career, Eder views &quot;Pin Ups&quot; as an artistic statement, in that it represented a &quot;swan song&quot; for the Spiders from Mars and an &quot;interlude&quot; between the first and second phases of his international career, with his next album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; being the end of his glam rock era: &quot;It&#x27;s not a bad bridge between the two, and it has endured across the decades.&quot;

Despite mixed reactions overall, some publications have praised &quot;Pin Ups&quot; as a covers album, calling it one of the finest in the genre. Pierre Perrone of &quot;The Independent&quot; and the writers of &quot;NME&quot; classified &quot;Pin Ups&quot; as one of the best cover albums in 2013 and 2019, respectively, with the former describing it as &quot;[t]he covers album that launched a thousand copycats.&quot; Radio X called it the best covers album ever in 2023. Eder states that today it is still dismissed by many as just another covers album, including Wolk, who in 2015 described it as &quot;quick-and-sloppy&quot;.

The American alternative rock band Human Drama imitated &quot;Pin Ups&quot; for the concept, cover artwork and packaging of their 1993 covers album &quot;Pinups&quot;.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;Pin Ups&quot; has been reissued several times, on vinyl and other media. The album was first released on compact disc by RCA in the mid-1980s. In 1990, it was reissued by Rykodisc with two bonus tracks: a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Growin&#x27; Up&quot; (recorded during the sessions for &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and featuring Ronnie Wood on guitar) and &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Sorrow&quot;. This reissue charted at number 52 on the UK Albums Chart for one week in July 1990. It was remastered in 1999 by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios for EMI and Virgin Records, and issued on CD with no bonus tracks. It was again remastered in 2015 for inclusion on the box set &quot;Five Years 1969–1973&quot; by Parlophone and rereleased separately, in 2015–2016, in CD, vinyl and digital formats. &quot;Pin Ups&quot; was reissued as a limited edition half-speed mastered LP to celebrate its 50th anniversary on 20 October 2023.

<doc id="1261535" wikidata="Q1129202" url="?curid=1261535" title="The Man Who Sold the World (album)">
<text>The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released through Mercury Records in the United States on 4November 1970 and in the United Kingdom on 10April 1971. Produced by Tony Visconti and recorded in London from April to May 1970, the album features the first appearances on a Bowie record of future Spiders from Mars members Mick Ronson and Mick Woodmansey.

Following the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of &quot;David Bowie&quot; (1969), &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; marked a shift toward hard rock, with elements of blues rock. The lyrics are darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religion, technology and war. None of its songs were released as singles; some tracks appeared as B-sides between 1970 and 1973. Originally titled &quot;Metrobolist&quot;, a play on the film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), the title was changed at the last minute by Mercury without Bowie&#x27;s consultation.

The album was released with different cover artwork in the US and the UK. For the US release, the artwork was a cartoon-like drawing by Michael J. Weller of a cowboy in front of an asylum. The UK cover by Keith MacMillan features Bowie wearing a Michael Fish-designed blue dress. A 1972 reissue by RCA Records featured a black-and-white picture of Bowie&#x27;s then-current character Ziggy Stardust; reissues since 1990 have revived the original UK artwork.

&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was originally better received by music critics in the US than in the UK. Nevertheless, it was a commercial failure in both countries; the 1972 reissue managed to chart in both the US and the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised by critics for the band&#x27;s performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics, being considered by many to be the start of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;. It has since been reissued multiple times and was remixed in 2020, under its original title &quot;Metrobolist&quot;, for its 50th anniversary.

==Background==
David Bowie&#x27;s breakthrough single &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was released in July 1969, bringing him commercial success and attention. Its parent album, &quot;David Bowie (Space Oddity)&quot;, released later that year, fared worse, partly due to the failure of Philips Records to promote the album efficiently. By 1970, the attention Bowie had garnered from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; had dissipated and his follow-up single, &quot;The Prettiest Star&quot;, failed to chart. 

Realising that his potential as a solo artist was dwindling, Bowie formed a band, Hype, with the bassist Tony Visconti, one of his &quot;Space Oddity&quot; collaborators, the drummer John Cambridge, and the guitarist Mick Ronson, whom Bowie met in February 1970. For the group&#x27;s performances, the members wore flamboyant superhero-like costumes. Bowie halted Hype performances at the end of March 1970 so he could focus on recording and songwriting, and resolve managing disputes with his manager Kenneth Pitt. A new single version of the &quot;Space Oddity&quot; track &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot; and an early attempt at &quot;The Supermen&quot; were recorded during this time.

Cambridge was dismissed from Hype at the end of March, and was replaced by Mick &quot;Woody&quot; Woodmansey. Woodmansey said of Bowie in 2015: &quot;This guy was living and breathing being a rock &amp; roll star.&quot; By April 1970, the four members of Hype were living in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion converted to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambiance &quot;like Dracula&#x27;s living room&quot;. Ronson and Visconti built a makeshift studio under the grand staircase at Haddon Hall, where Bowie recorded many of his early 1970s demos.

==Recording==

Recording for &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; began on 17April 1970 at Advision Studios in London, with the group beginning work on &quot;All the Madmen&quot;. The next day, Ralph Mace was hired to play a Moog synthesiser following his work on the single version of &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot;. At the time, Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records. During this time, Bowie terminated his contract with Pitt and met his future manager Tony Defries, who assisted Bowie in the termination. Recording moved to Trident Studios in London on 21April and continued there until mid-May. On 4May, the band recorded &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot; and &quot;Saviour Machine&quot;, the latter of which was originally the working title for the title track, before Bowie reworked the song into a different melody to form the final version of &quot;Saviour Machine&quot;. Recording and mixing was moved back to Advision on 12May and completed ten days later. Bowie recorded his vocal for the title track on the final day.

Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie and managerial issues at the time, so the music was largely arranged by Ronson and Visconti. Ronson used the sessions to learn about many production and arrangement techniques from Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, the author Peter Doggett quoted Visconti as saying that &quot;the songs were written by all four of us. We&#x27;d jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not.&quot; In Doggett&#x27;s narrative, &quot;The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might or might not be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics.&quot; Conversely, Bowie said in 1998, &quot;I really did object to the impression that I did not write the songs on &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. You only have to check out the chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that.&quot; &quot;The Width of a Circle&quot; and &quot;The Supermen&quot;, for example, were already in existence before the sessions began.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was a departure from the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. According to the music critic Greg Kot, it marked Bowie&#x27;s change of direction into hard rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as &quot;almost all hard blues rock or psychedelic folk rock&quot;, while Doggett writes that it is &quot;filled with propulsive hard rock&quot;. Much of the material has a distinct heavy metal edge that distinguishes it from Bowie&#x27;s other releases, and has been compared to contemporary acts such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. According to Marc Spitz, Ronson was intent on making a heavy blues album &quot;worthy of Cream.&quot; The music writer Simon Reynolds, comparing parts of the album to Van Der Graaf Generator and Comus, interpreted it as &quot;Bowie trying to pass for an underground band&quot;, despite having already abandoned hippy values.

Like the music, the lyrics are significantly darker than its predecessor. According to Doggett, they contain numerous themes that Bowie would continue to explore throughout the rest of the 1970s decade, including &quot;madness, alienation, violence, confusion of identity, power, darkness and sexual possession&quot;. The lyrics have also been seen as reflecting the influence of such figures as Aleister Crowley, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche. Since Bowie wrote most of the lyrics at the last minute, O&#x27;Leary writes that &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; is a more &quot;coherent&quot; concept album than &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; (1972) and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). He continues, saying that the songs &quot;mirror and answer each other&quot;, sharing similar themes and imagery.

===Side one===
The opening track, &quot;The Width of a Circle&quot;, is an eight-minute epic that delves into progressive rock. Originally debuted in February 1970 at a BBC session, the song is led by Ronson&#x27;s widely lauded guitar work, using feedback and improvisation throughout. The lyrics reference the Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran and in the song&#x27;s second half, the narrator has a sexual encounter with God in the devil&#x27;s lair. Nicholas Pegg describes the song&#x27;s sound as reminiscent of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. The lyrics of &quot;All the Madmen&quot; were inspired by Bowie&#x27;s half-brother Terry Burns and reflect the theme of institutionalised madness. The song contains a recorder part that creates an atmosphere, which Buckley describes as &quot;childlike dementia&quot;. Doggett describes the Moog synthesiser as an integral part of the recording, noting that it gives the track a &quot;stunning conclusion&quot;. Spitz calls the track &quot;terrifying&quot;.

For &quot;Black Country Rock&quot;, Bowie had a small portion of the melody and four quickly-written lines that he gave to Ronson and Visconti, who expanded upon them to create the song. A blues rock and hard rock song, Bowie impersonates Marc Bolan in his vocal performance. &quot;After All&quot; is musically different from the rest of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, being more akin to folk rock than hard rock. Featuring an &quot;oh, by jingo&quot; chant that is reminiscent of music hall numbers, the lyrics follow a group of innocent children who have not experienced the corruptions of adulthood. Similar to &quot;The Supermen&quot;, the song references the works of Nietzsche.

===Side two===

The lyrics of &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot; discuss gun-toting assassins and Vietnam War commentary, specifically the Mỹ Lai massacre of 1968. Although the lyrics reflect the themes of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, the music reflects the predominant hard rock style of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World &quot; and points to Bowie&#x27;s future musical direction. Similar to the previous track, &quot;Saviour Machine&quot; is rooted in blues rock and hard rock. The lyrics explore the concept of computers overtaking the human race; Bowie&#x27;s metallic-like vocal performance enhances the scenario. Like the majority of the tracks, &quot;She Shook Me Cold&quot; was mostly created by Ronson, Visconti and Woodmansey without Bowie&#x27;s input. Spitz compares the song&#x27;s blues style to Led Zeppelin, while O&#x27;Leary and Pegg write that Ronson was attempting to emulate Cream&#x27;s Jack Bruce. The lyrics explore a sexual conquest similar to &quot;You Shook Me&quot; (then-recently covered by Jeff Beck) and Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Love in Vain&quot;.

The album&#x27;s title track has been described by multiple reviewers as &quot;haunting&quot;. Musically, it is based around a &quot;circular&quot; guitar riff from Ronson. The lyrics are cryptic and evocative, inspired by numerous poems, including &quot;Antigonish&quot; (1899) by William Hughes Mearns. The narrator has an encounter with a kind of doppelgänger, as suggested in the second chorus where &quot;I never lost control&quot; is replaced with &quot;We never lost control&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s vocals are heavily &quot;phased&quot; throughout and contain none of the, in Doggett&#x27;s words, &quot;metallic theatrics&quot; that are found on the rest of the album. The song also features güiro percussion, which Pegg describes as &quot;sinister&quot;. &quot;The Supermen&quot; prominently reflects the themes of Nietzsche, particularly his theory of &quot;Übermensch&quot;, or &quot;Supermen&quot;. Like other tracks on the album, the song is predominantly hard rock. It was described by Bowie in 1973 as a &quot;period piece&quot;, and later &quot;pre-fascist&quot;.

==Cover artwork==

The original 1970 US release of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; featured a cartoon-like cover drawing by Bowie&#x27;s friend Michael J. Weller, featuring a cowboy in front of Cane Hill asylum. Weller, whose friend was a patient there, suggested the idea after Bowie had asked him to create a design that would capture the music&#x27;s foreboding tone. Drawing on pop art styles, he depicted a dreary main entrance block to the hospital with a damaged clock tower. For the design&#x27;s foreground, Weller used a photograph of the actor John Wayne to draw a cowboy figure wearing a ten-gallon hat and holding a rifle, which was meant to be an allusion to the song &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot;. Bowie suggested Weller incorporate the &quot;exploding head&quot; signature on the cowboy&#x27;s hat, a feature he had previously used on his posters while a part of the Arts Lab. He also added an empty speech balloon for the cowboy figure, which was intended to include the line &quot;roll up your sleeves and show us your arms&quot;—a pun on record players, guns, and drug use—but Mercury found the idea too risqué and the balloon was left blank. Bowie wanted the album titled &quot;Metrobolist&quot;, a play on Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;Metropolis&quot;, but Mercury changed the title without Bowie&#x27;s consent to &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.

Bowie was enthusiastic about the finished design, but soon reconsidered the idea and had the art department at Philips Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, enlist the photographer Keith MacMillan to shoot an alternate cover. The shoot took place in a &quot;domestic environment&quot; of the Haddon Hall living room, where Bowie reclined on a chaise longue in a cream and blue satin &quot;man&#x27;s dress&quot;, an early indication of his interest in exploiting his androgynous appearance. The dress was designed by the British fashion designer Michael Fish. Bowie&#x27;s look and pose in the photo were inspired by a Pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In the United States, Mercury rejected MacMillan&#x27;s photo and released the album with Weller&#x27;s design as its cover, much to Bowie&#x27;s displeasure, although he successfully lobbied the label to use the photo for the release in the United Kingdom. In 1972, he said Weller&#x27;s design was &quot;horrible&quot; but reappraised it in 1999, saying he &quot;actually thought the cartoon cover was really cool&quot;.

While promoting &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; in the US, Bowie wore the Fish dress in February 1971 on his first promotional tour and during interviews, despite the fact that the Americans had no knowledge of the then-unreleased UK cover. The 1971 German release&#x27;s artwork presented a winged hybrid creature with Bowie&#x27;s head and a hand for a body, preparing to flick the Earth away. For the cover of the 1972 worldwide reissue by RCA Records, the label used a black-and-white photograph of Bowie in character as Ziggy Stardust in an action pose, wielding a guitar and with his left leg up in the air. The pose was inspired by Bowie&#x27;s friend Freddie Buretti, who appeared in a similar pose for a brochure in July 1972. The image remained the cover art on reissues until 1990 when the Rykodisc release reinstated the UK &quot;dress&quot; cover. The &quot;dress&quot; cover has appeared on subsequent reissues of the album.

In 2011, when the Victoria and Albert Museum in London was putting together the list of Bowie artifacts for the &quot;David Bowie Is&quot; show, the curators asked for the dress to display, but found that the dress had gone missing from Bowie&#x27;s collection.

==Release==
&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was released in the US through Mercury on 4November 1970, and in the UK on 10April 1971. Bowie was initially aggravated that Mercury had retitled the album from his preferred title of &quot;Metrobolist&quot; without his consultation, but following its release in the US, Bowie attempted to persuade the label to retitle the album &quot;Holy Holy&quot; after his newly released single &quot;Holy Holy&quot;. Following the commercial flop of &quot;Holy Holy&quot;, the title remained &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; for the UK release. According to Kevin Cann, the album was disliked by Mercury executives, but was played on US radio stations frequently and the &quot;heavy rock content&quot; increased interest in Bowie. Cann says that &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; also developed an underground following and laid &quot;solid foundations&quot; for &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

None of the songs from the album were released as singles at the time, although a promo version of &quot;All the Madmen&quot; was issued in the US in 1970. Mercury released &quot;All the Madmen&quot; as a single, with &quot;Space Oddity&quot; &quot;Janine&quot; on the B-side, but withdrew it. The same song appeared in Eastern Europe during 1973, as did &quot;The Width of a Circle&quot;. &quot;Black Country Rock&quot; was released as the B-side of &quot;Holy Holy&quot; in the UK in January 1971, shortly before the release of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. The title track appeared as the B-side of both the US single release of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in 1972 and the UK release of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; in 1973.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was initially a commercial failure. By the end of June 1971, the album had sold only 1,395 copies in the US. The same year, Bowie said: &quot;[it] sold like hotcakes in Beckenham, and nowhere else&quot;. Following his commercial breakthrough with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in 1972, RCA reissued &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; in the UK and the US on 10November. This release peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for 30 weeks, and number 105 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, spending 23 weeks on the chart. The album&#x27;s 1990 reissue charted again on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 66.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was generally more well-received critically in the US than in the UK. Music publications &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; originally found &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; &quot;surprisingly excellent&quot; and &quot;rather hysterical&quot;, respectively. Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in February 1971, John Mendelsohn called the album &quot;uniformly excellent&quot; and commented that Visconti&#x27;s &quot;use of echo, phasing, and other techniques on Bowie&#x27;s voice ... serves to reinforce the jaggedness of Bowie&#x27;s words and music&quot;, which he interpreted as &quot;oblique and fragmented images that are almost impenetrable separately but which convey with effectiveness an ironic and bitter sense of the world when considered together&quot;.

Colman Andrews of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; felt that record was a mixed bag, finding the lyrics both good and bad and Bowie&#x27;s voice to be undistinguishable from other British artists, but enjoyed his vocal performance. Overall, Andrews stated, &quot;[&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;] TRIES to define some new province of modern music, even if it&#x27;s not completely successful. For that alone it deserves some attention.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau considered the album and its predecessor to be &quot;overwrought excursions&quot;. Mike Saunders from &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot; magazine included &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; in his ballot of 1971&#x27;s top 10 albums for the first annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll of American critics, published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in February 1972.

==Subsequent events==
After the completion of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. His contract with music publisher Essex had expired and Defries, his new manager, was facing prior contractual challenges. In August 1970, Visconti parted ways with Bowie owing to his dislike of Defries and his frustration with Bowie&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm during the making of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;; it was the last time he would see the artist for three or four years. Ronson and Woodmansey also departed due to other personal conflicts with Bowie. Despite his annoyance with Bowie during the sessions, Visconti still rated &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; as his best work with him until his fourteenth studio album &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980).

The critical success of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; in the US prompted Mercury to send Bowie on a promotional radio tour of the country in February 1971. Upon his return, he wrote the majority of the material that would appear on the follow-up albums &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971) and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Bowie also convened with Ronson and Woodmansey, who returned to play on both records. Following the commercial disappointment of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, Bowie finally found commercial success with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in 1972. Ronson and Woodmansey, along with bassist Trevor Bolder, became famous as the Spiders from Mars.

==Influence and legacy==

&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; has been retrospectively described by Bowie&#x27;s biographers and commentators as the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s artistic growth, many considering it the first album where he began to find his sound. David Buckley has described it as &quot;the first Bowie album proper&quot;, and &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray stated, &quot;this is where the story &quot;really&quot; starts&quot;. Erlewine cited &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; as the beginning of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;. Annie Zaleski of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the album his &quot;career blueprint&quot;, writing that it was musically a forerunner to the &quot;swaggering electric disorientation&quot; of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973), but its greater importance on sequencing and atmosphere, as well as stronger songwriting, predated &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Paul Trynka calls &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;first truly gripping work&quot;. Pegg finds it one of the best and most important albums in the history of rock music. In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it was voted Bowie&#x27;s tenth greatest album.

The album has been praised for the band&#x27;s performance and the unsettling nature of its music and lyrics. In a review for AllMusic, Erlewine complimented its &quot;tight, twisted heavy guitar rock that appears simple on the surface but sounds more gnarled upon each listen&quot;. He viewed its music and Bowie&#x27;s &quot;paranoid futuristic tales&quot; as &quot;bizarre&quot;, adding that: &quot;Musically, there isn&#x27;t much time for innovation ...but there&#x27;s an unsettling edge to the band&#x27;s performance, which makes the record one of Bowie&#x27;s best albums.&quot; In a review upon the album&#x27;s reissue, a writer for &quot;Q&quot; called it &quot;a robust, sexually charged affair&quot;, while a &quot;Mojo&quot; columnist wrote, &quot;A robust set that spins with dizzying disorientation ... Bowie&#x27;s armoury was being hastily assembled, though it was never deployed with such thrilling abandon again.&quot; Douglas Wolk of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album the &quot;dark horse&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s catalogue. Comparing &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; to its predecessor, he praised the arrangements as tougher and &quot;more effective&quot;, and complimented his artistic growth.

The album has since been cited as inspiring the goth rock, dark wave and science fiction elements of work by artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Gary Numan, John Foxx and Nine Inch Nails. It has been claimed that glam rock began with the release of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, though this is also attributed to Bolan&#x27;s appearance on the UK television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in March 1971 wearing glitter. In his journal, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana listed it at number 45 on his top 50 favourite albums list. The title track provided an unlikely hit for Scottish pop singer Lulu, which was produced by Bowie and Ronson, and would be covered by many artists over the years, including Richard Barone in 1987, and Nirvana in 1993 for their live album &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;.

===Reissues===
&quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was first released on CD by RCA in 1984. The album was reissued by Rykodisc/EMI in 1990 with bonus tracks, including a 1971 rerecording of &quot;Holy Holy&quot; that had originally been issued as a B-side in 1974. &quot;Holy Holy&quot; was incorrectly described in the liner notes as the original single version recorded in 1970. Bowie vetoed inclusion of the earlier recording, and the single remained its only official release until 2015, when it was included on &quot;Re:Call 1&quot;, part of the &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; compilation. Additionally, the liner notes incorrectly listed the personnel for &quot;Lightning Frightening&quot; as those who played with Bowie during the &quot;Space Oddity&quot; period, when in fact the personnel were members of the Arnold Corns sessions proto-group.

In 1999, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; was reissued again by Virgin/EMI, without the bonus tracks but with 24-bit digitally remastered sound. In 2015, the album was remastered for the &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; box set. It was released on CD, vinyl and digital formats, both as part of the compilation and separately.

On 6 November 2020, the album was reissued by Parlophone under its working title of &quot;Metrobolist&quot; to commemorate its 50th anniversary. The reissue featured an updated version of the original Weller artwork as its official cover. For this release, Visconti remixed every song, except &quot;After All&quot;, because he felt the 2015 remastered mix was &quot;perfect as is&quot;. In 2021, a companion 2-CD set called &quot;The Width of a Circle&quot; was announced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the British release. A press notice stated that the collection, released on 28 May, features &quot;non-album singles, a BBC In Concert session, music for a TV play and further Visconti remixes wrapping up (Bowie&#x27;s) recordings from 1970 and revealing the first sonic steps toward &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1261542" wikidata="Q1780602" url="?curid=1261542" title="Les Misérables (1995 film)">
<text>Les Misérables is a 1995 French war film written, produced and directed by Claude Lelouch. Set in France during the first half of the 20th century, the film concerns a poor and illiterate man named Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who is introduced to Victor Hugo&#x27;s classic 1862 novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and begins to see parallels to his own life. The film won the 1995 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Plot==
As the film opens, Henri&#x27;s father, a chauffeur also named Henri, is falsely accused of having murdered his boss. During his trial and imprisonment, Henri&#x27;s mother finds a job in a tavern on a Normandy beach. There Henri sees a film adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. His father dies attempting to escape from prison, and upon hearing the news Henri&#x27;s mother commits suicide. Henri grows up an orphan and learns boxing.

The film next takes up the story of Elisa, a ballerina, and André Ziman, a young Jewish journalist and law student. They meet following a performance of a ballet based on &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Later, during World War II, André and Elisa, now married, and their daughter Salomé attempt to cross the Swiss border to escape the Nazis. They encounter Henri, who owns a moving company, and they discuss the Hugo novel. The Zimans entrust Salomé to Henri and enroll her in a Catholic convent school. André and Elisa are ambushed while trying to cross the frontier. Elisa is arrested and André wounded. Farmers who find him give him shelter.

The members of a local gang and Henri join the French Resistance, but the gang members take advantage of their anti-Nazi attacks to steal from local houses. Elisa and other women are forced to entertain the Nazi occupiers. She is sent to a concentration camp for being defiant. After staging an attack on a train transporting funds for the Vichy government, Henri and his mates travel to Normandy to visit the tavern where he lived as a child. The D-Day invasion is launched the next day and Henri supports the Allied forces when they conquer the beach. In the process he saves the life of the tavern owner&#x27;s son Marius.

At the war&#x27;s end, Henri accepts an offer to run a seaside camp in Normandy. There he receives a letter from Salomé, who has no way of contacting her family. He takes her with him to the resort, which he names Chez Jean Valjean. Elisa, having survived a Nazi concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, joins them later.

A former Vichy police agent accuses Henri of abetting the gang&#x27;s activities during the war and of robbing and burning a train. He is imprisoned to await trial. Meanwhile André&#x27;s one-time rescuer is holding him captive, hoping to live off his bank account. The farmer has told André that the American D-Day invasion failed and the Nazis now rule the world. With evident reluctance, the farmer&#x27;s wife supports her husband in these lies until he attempts to poison André. Then she shoots her husband before he can feed André the poisoned soup. As she checks to see if her husband is dead, he grabs her and chokes her to death. André escapes from his cellar prison on a bad leg and emerges to find the farmer couple dead and a liberated Europe. He rejoins his wife and daughter at Chez Jean Valjean and then represents Henri at his trial and wins his acquittal.

As the film ends, Henri, now the mayor, presides at the civil marriage of Salomé and Marius in the presence of André and Elisa and the mother superior of the school that sheltered Salomé. André Ziman quotes Victor Hugo: &quot;The best of our lives is yet to come.&quot;

The film received positive reviews from critics with a score of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert wrote he liked this film&#x27;s &quot;expansive freedom and (the) energy of its storytelling&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a spectacular-looking film&quot; that &quot;eventually becomes needlessly drawn-out&quot;, and added: &quot;the cast is staunch...but Belmondo...easily walks away with the picture.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; said it was the &quot;mightiest of Lelouch’s humanist hymns&quot;, and Belmondo &quot;gives one of the finest perfs of his career&quot;. Janet Maslin, who reviewed the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, meanwhile complained about &quot;odd variations on Hugo&#x27;s themes.&quot;

The film won the 1995 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Annie Girardot won the 1996 César Award for Best Supporting Actress.

<doc id="1261545" wikidata="Q765031" url="?curid=1261545" title="Young Americans">
<text>Young Americans is the ninth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 7March 1975 through RCA Records. A departure from the glam rock style of previous albums, the record showcased Bowie&#x27;s interest in soul and R&amp;B. Music critics have described the sound as blue-eyed soul; Bowie himself labelled the album&#x27;s sound &quot;plastic soul&quot;. 

Recording sessions began at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia in August 1974, after the first leg of Bowie&#x27;s Diamond Dogs Tour. The record was produced by Tony Visconti, and includes a variety of musicians, such as the guitarist Carlos Alomar, who became one of Bowie&#x27;s most frequent collaborators, and the backing vocalists Ava Cherry, Robin Clark and then-unknown singer Luther Vandross. As the tour continued the setlist and design began to incorporate the influence of the new material. The recording sessions continued at the Record Plant in New York City at the tour&#x27;s end. A collaboration between Bowie and John Lennon yielded a cover of Lennon&#x27;s Beatles song &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and an original, &quot;Fame&quot;, during a January 1975 session at Electric Lady Studios, produced by Harry Maslin. The album&#x27;s cover artwork is a back-lit photograph of Bowie taken by Eric Stephen Jacobs.

&quot;Young Americans&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s breakthrough in the US, reaching the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart; &quot;Fame&quot; became Bowie&#x27;s first number one hit single. Bowie continued developing its sound on &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976). &quot;Young Americans&quot; has received mixed critical reviews on release and in later decades; Bowie himself had mixed feelings about the album. The album proved influential. Bowie was one of the first white artists of the era to overtly engage with newly emerging black musical styles; other British artists followed suit. The album has been reissued multiple times with outtakes, and was remastered in 2016 as part of the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set.

==Background and development==
David Bowie released his eighth studio album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; in May 1974. His final album in the glam rock genre, it contained two songs, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll with Me&quot; and &quot;1984&quot;, that exhibit elements of funk and soul, which predicted the musical direction for Bowie&#x27;s next project. While his interest in soul music dated back to his mod days in the mid-1960s, he began listening to soul records extensively and incorporating soul material into his live sets. In July, towards the end of the first leg of his Diamond Dogs Tour, he performed covers of the soul songs &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; by Eddie Floyd and &quot;Here Today and Gone Tomorrow&quot; by the Ohio Players for shows in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania; these shows were recorded and released on the live album &quot;David Live&quot; in October 1974. Bowie had grown tired of the tour&#x27;s lavish set-pieces and theatricality and was ready to fully embrace black soul music.
In early 1974, Bowie met the funk guitarist Carlos Alomar, an Apollo Theater session musician who had played with James Brown, Chuck Berry and Wilson Pickett. One of Bowie&#x27;s favourite records was Brown&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; (1963), so meeting a musician who played at the Apollo meant a lot to him. Alomar had never heard of Bowie when they met, but they immediately connected and formed a working relationship that would last almost 15 years; Alomar became Bowie&#x27;s guide into American black music.

While in Pennsylvania, Bowie visited Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia to work on recordings with the American musician Ava Cherry. Sigma Sound was the home of Philadelphia soul and the favourite studio of the writer-producer duo Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff; the two had co-founded Philadelphia International Records, the home of many well-known black American musicians. At the end of the first leg of the tour, Bowie returned to New York City to mix &quot;David Live&quot;, listening to various black albums in preparation for his return to Sigma Sound.
==Recording history==

For the backing band, Bowie wanted to hire MFSB (&quot;Mother Father Sister Brother&quot;), Sigma Sound&#x27;s house band of over 30 session musicians. Due to conflicting schedules, all members were unavailable except the percussionist Larry Washington (percussion), so Bowie went to New York City for further recruitment. Mike Garson (piano), David Sanborn (saxophone) and Pablo Rosario (percussion) were retained from the Diamond Dogs Tour, while Earl Slick was replaced by Alomar on guitar. At Alomar&#x27;s suggestion, Bowie hired Andy Newmark, a former member of Sly and the Family Stone, and Willie Weeks of the Isley Brothers to replace Tony Newman and Herbie Flowers on drums and bass, respectively. The producer Tony Visconti joined the project immediately after Bowie informed him of Weeks&#x27; involvement; Visconti co-produced much of Bowie&#x27;s work for the rest of the decade. Cherry, Alomar&#x27;s wife Robin Clark, then-unknown singer Luther Vandross, Anthony Hinton and Diane Sumler performed backing vocals for the sessions.

===Philadelphia sessions===
Demo work began at Sigma Sound on 8August 1974, with official work starting three days later on 11August upon Visconti&#x27;s arrival. Before Philadelphia, Bowie had spent most of his recording career in Britain, where recording methods were different from those in the United States. At Olympic and Trident Studios in Britain, engineers applied equalisers and reverb as they were recording, so these effects were heard upon playback. At Sigma Sound, however, the engineers applied effects during the mixing stage. Bowie was initially confounded when hearing the tapes back, as according to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, he &quot;hadn&#x27;t heard his &#x27;naked&#x27; voice on tape in years&quot;.
The sessions were productive and moved rapidly, only taking two weeks to complete. It was agreed early on to record as much of the album as possible live, with the full band playing together, including Bowie&#x27;s vocals, as a single continuous take for each song. According to Visconti, the album contains &quot;about 85% &#x27;live&#x27; David Bowie&quot;. Most of the material was built out of jam sessions. The album represented a change in Bowie&#x27;s approach to production, allowing the musicians to come up with ideas that Bowie used to write lyrics and melodies. Cherry, Clark and Vandross, in particular, became driving forces of the project.

During his time at Sigma Sound, Bowie completely immersed himself in soul music. He created a new persona called &quot;The Gouster&quot;, a slang term for a hip street boy, which became one of the album&#x27;s working titles. Visconti commented: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much a concept as a way of setting the tone that we were going to make a very hip album.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s cocaine addiction heightened at a rapid pace during the period; he often stayed awake day and night recording while the band slept. Alomar said the sessions were &quot;fuelled&quot; by drugs, recalling: &quot;He used drugs to keep himself awake. [I assumed] it was more a functional thing [than an addiction], so he&#x27;d be &#x27;on&#x27; whenever the moment came to record.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s cocaine use affected his voice, creating what Bowie himself called &quot;a real raspy sound&quot; that prevented him from singing higher notes. He believed the album contained the highest notes he ever sang on record.

The sessions produced numerous outtakes, including &quot;After Today&quot;, &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot;, a rerecording of Bowie&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot; titled &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing (Again)&quot;, &quot;Lazer&quot;, &quot;Shilling the Rubes&quot;, a scrapped rerecording of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be a Saint in the City&quot; and &quot;Too Fat Polka&quot;. After these sessions, Bowie was eager to perform the new work live. Embarking on the second half of the Diamond Dogs Tour, lasting September to December 1974, this portion is nicknamed the Soul Tour due to the influence of the new material. The shows were heavily altered and no longer featured elaborate set-pieces, due to Bowie&#x27;s exhaustion with the design and wanting to explore the new sound he was creating. Songs from the previous leg were dropped, while new ones were added, including some from the upcoming album. On 2 November, Bowie appeared on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; and performed &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Young Americans&quot; and a version of the Flairs&#x27; &quot;Footstompin. He was inarticulate and visibly drugged during his interview.

Bowie and Visconti added overdubs and started mixing following the conclusion of the Soul Tour in November 1974. Local fans, whom Bowie referred to as the &quot;Sigma Kids&quot;, waited outside the studio over the course of the sessions. On the final day of tracking, these fans were invited into the studio to listen to rough versions of the new songs. The album&#x27;s many working titles included &quot;The Gouster&quot;, &quot;Dancin″&quot;, &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, &quot;One Damned Song&quot;, &quot;Shilling the Rubes&quot; and &quot;Fascination&quot;. An early acetate of &quot;The Gouster&quot; provided by Visconti showed &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing (Again)&quot;, &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; in the track-listing.
===New York sessions===

The Soul Tour ended in December 1974, after which Bowie, Visconti and Alomar regrouped at the Record Plant in New York City to record two new songs, &quot;Fascination&quot; and &quot;Win&quot;. At this point, Bowie told &quot;Disc&quot; magazine the album title was &quot;Fascination&quot; (after the newly recorded track); &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing (Again)&quot; was still in the track-listing and the two new tracks replaced &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot; and &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;. Visconti, who believed the album was completely finished, returned to London to record string arrangements for &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot;, &quot;Win&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; at AIR Studios, while Bowie remained in New York, working on separate mixing with in-house engineer Harry Maslin.

During this time, former Beatle John Lennon was working at the Record Plant on his covers album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1975). Lennon, who was in what he later termed his &quot;Lost weekend&quot; period, had met Bowie in Los Angeles in September 1974. The two connected and decided to record together. With Alomar, the two convened at New York City&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios in January 1975, recording a cover of Lennon&#x27;s Beatles song &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and a new song, &quot;Fame&quot;. In Visconti&#x27;s absence, the session was co-produced by Bowie and Maslin. Alongside Alomar, Bowie invited Slick and the drummer Dennis Davis, making their debuts on a Bowie record, as well as the bassist Emir Ksasan from the Soul Tour band. Ralph MacDonald contributed percussion, while Jean Fineberg and Jean Millington sang backing vocals.

Mixing for &quot;Young Americans&quot; was completed at the Record Plant on 12January 1975. Bowie contacted Visconti about the collaborations with Lennon two weeks later. Bowie was apologetic and requested the two tracks be on the final album; they replaced &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; and &quot;After Today&quot;. Visconti later said: &quot;[They were] beautiful songs and it made me sick when [Bowie] decided not to use them. I think it was the personal content of the songs which he was a bit reluctant to release, although it was so obscure I don&#x27;t think even I knew what he was on about in them!&quot; The album was mastered by the engineer Greg Calbi.
==Songs==
&quot;Young Americans&quot; presented a new musical direction for Bowie, exploring blue-eyed soul and R&amp;B. Bowie himself labelled its sound &quot;plastic soul&quot;, or, in the words of the author Benoît Clerc, &quot;a pale synthetic derivative of authentic soul music&quot;. Garson later argued: &quot;I think because he was uncertain if he was good at it, he demeaned himself by calling it plastic soul.&quot; Other writers have classified it &quot;sax-y white soul&quot; and white soul music. Ashley Naftule of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; described the album as a cross between Bowie&#x27;s &quot;artsy rocker tendencies&quot; and the &quot;warm earnestness&quot; of soul and R&amp;B. According to BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea, lyrical themes throughout the album include loneliness, despair and alienation, although the biographer Christopher Sandford writes that the album is &quot;a record of high spirits and lively, colliding ideas&quot;. One of Bowie&#x27;s major inspirations when writing the album was Aretha Franklin.

===Side one===
&quot;Young Americans&quot; opens the album, which Bowie said was about &quot;a newly-wed couple who don&#x27;t know if they really like each other&quot;. The song also presents new lyrical directions for the artist: instead of &quot;shady&quot; characters living in worlds fraught with darkness, &quot;Young Americans&quot; shows typical American teenagers. References are made to McCarthyism and the resignation of president Richard Nixon, which occurred a week before the recording sessions began. The line &quot;I heard the news today, oh boy&quot; was taken from the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (1967), acknowledging Lennon&#x27;s influence on Bowie and their imminent collaboration later on the album. The author Peter Doggett writes that the song introduced the world to an entirely new Bowie, catching everyone by surprise. Bowie said &quot;Win&quot; was about people who &quot;don&#x27;t work very hard&quot;. According to the author James E. Perone, the lyrics are more abstract than the previous track and are open to interpretation. Saxophones and strings feature throughout, while the backing vocalists are more relaxed and in line with Bowie&#x27;s lead.

&quot;Fascination&quot; evolved out of a Vandross track titled &quot;Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)&quot;, which Bowie added new lyrics to. Bowie kept most of Vandross&#x27; structure but changed the interplay of the backing vocalists. Doggett cites elements in the novels &quot;City of Night&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Occult Reich&quot; (1974) as inspirations for the title, while David Buckley writes that it reaffirms the &#x27;strange fascination&#x27; motif of Bowie&#x27;s track &quot;Changes&quot; (1971). &quot;Right&quot; is the only track on &quot;Young Americans&quot; to feature Bowie&#x27;s old friend Geoff MacCormack. The call and response between Bowie and the backing singers &quot;lends an air of immaculate sophistication to the lyric&#x27;s paean to positive thinking&quot;, according to the biographer Nicholas Pegg. In 1975, Bowie called the song a mantra: &quot;People forget what the sound of Man&#x27;s instinct is—it&#x27;s a drone, a mantra. And people say, &#x27;Why are so many things popular that just drone on and on?&#x27; But that&#x27;s the point really. It reaches a particular vibration, not necessarily a musical level.&quot; Bowie, Vandross, Clark and Cherry can be seen rehearsing the song in the BBC documentary &quot;Cracked Actor&quot; (1975).

===Side two===

The title of &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; was taken from the 1956 film of the same name. Similar to &quot;Right&quot;, it uses a call-and-response structure and is embellished in strings, saxophone and synthesisers that hide dark lyrics. Pegg states that the lyrics discuss the idea of celebrity and the &quot;hollowness of fame and adulation&quot;. Bowie himself described the song as a &quot;Watch out mate, Hitler&#x27;s on your back&quot; warning. Bowie&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is a blue-eyed soul reworking that features Lennon on guitar and backing vocals. Bowie had previously called the Beatles&#x27; original version &quot;very watery&quot; and wanted to &quot;hammer the hell out of it&quot;. His cover has been maligned by critics and biographers. Perone argues that it succeeds as a &quot;groove piece&quot;.

&quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot;, originally &quot;Take It in Right&quot;, is described by O&#x27;Leary as contemporary R&amp;B, while Doggett believes its style is more reminiscent of southern music rather than Philly soul. Perone likens Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance to the singer Al Green. In 1975, Bowie stated that the song was &quot;written for somebody&quot; but declined to disclose who; his biographers agree that it was most likely for Cherry.

&quot;Fame&quot; is a funk rock song that represents Bowie and Lennon&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the troubles of fame and stardom. Alomar originally developed the guitar riff for Bowie&#x27;s cover of &quot;Footstompin, which Bowie then used to create &quot;Fame&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s voice is heard interjecting the falsetto &quot;Fame&quot; throughout the song. Bowie later said that Lennon was the &quot;energy&quot; and the &quot;inspiration&quot; for &quot;Fame&quot;, which is why he received a writing credit; O&#x27;Leary states that Lennon wrote the song&#x27;s intro chord progression. In 1980, Lennon stated: &quot;We took some Stevie Wonder middle eight and did it backwards, you know, and we made a record out of it!&quot;

===Outtakes===
&quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot; reflects the theme of self-identity. Over its runtime, it builds to a what Pegg calls a &quot;gospel-choir climax&quot;. Doggett writes that its title summarises Bowie&#x27;s career up to this point, sharing a similar theme as &quot;Changes&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; is a ballad similar in style to Aretha Franklin. Originally titled &quot;Come Back My Baby&quot;, it is lyrically similar to &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot;, in that it follows a casual seducer who realises the error of his ways and works to redeem himself. Pegg and Doggett praised the track as one of the most overlooked gems of Bowie&#x27;s entire career. &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing (Again)&quot; is a radical seven-minute funk and disco reworking of Bowie&#x27;s 1972 glam rock single &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing&quot;. This new version mostly retains the original&#x27;s chorus, but with new verses and an entirely different melody. It was released as a single in 1979. &quot;After Today&quot; is a soul-disco song with a falsetto vocal from Bowie and less polished production compared to other album tracks.

==Artwork==
For the album cover artwork, Bowie initially wanted to commission Norman Rockwell to create a painting but retracted the offer when he heard that Rockwell would need at least six months to do the job. According to Pegg, another rejected idea was a full-length portrait of Bowie in a &quot;flying suit&quot; and white scarf, standing in front of an American flag and raising a glass. The final cover photo, a back-lit and airbrushed photo of Bowie, was taken in Los Angeles on 30August 1974 by the photographer Eric Stephen Jacobs. Jacobs took inspiration from a similar photo he took of the choreographer Toni Basil for the September 1974 cover of &quot;After Dark&quot; magazine. Using that photo, Craig DeCamps designed the final cover at RCA Records&#x27; New York City office. Sandford calls it one of the &quot;classic&quot; album covers.

==Release==
RCA released &quot;Young Americans&quot; as the lead single to the album on 21February 1975, with the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; track &quot;Suffragette City&quot; (1972) as the B-side. In the US, it was released in edited form, omitting two verses and a chorus; its B-side was the 1974 live cover of &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;. It reached number 18 on the UK Singles Chart and number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, his second top 40 entry and second-highest chart peak in the US up to that point. Bowie&#x27;s November 1974 performance of the song on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; was used as promotion, airing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 21February 1975.
&quot;Young Americans&quot; was released in the UK on 7March 1975, and in early April in the US. It reached number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and remained on the chart for 51 weeks; by July, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It stayed on the UK Albums Chart for 17 weeks, peaking at number two, being kept off the top spot by Tom Jones&#x27;s &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;. Elsewhere, &quot;Young Americans&quot; reached the top five in New Zealand and Sweden, the top ten in Australia and Finland, number 12 in France, 13 in Norway, 17 in Canada and 82 in Japan. According to Buckley, sales were lower than &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; overall.

The second single &quot;Fame&quot; was released on 2June in the US and on 25July in the UK, with the album track &quot;Right&quot; as the B-side. Although it only reached number 17 in the UK, &quot;Fame&quot; topped the charts in the US. Its chart success was a surprise to Bowie, who recalled in 1990: &quot;Even though [Lennon] had contributed to it and everything, and I had no idea, as with &#x27;Let&#x27;s Dance&#x27;, that that was what a commercial single is. I haven&#x27;t got a clue when it comes to singles... I don&#x27;t get it, and &#x27;Fame&#x27; was really out of left-field for me.&quot; In early November, he became one of the first white artists to appear on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Soul Train&quot;, where he gave mimed performances of &quot;Fame&quot; and his new single &quot;Golden Years&quot;. He then sang &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot; live on the CBS variety show &quot;Cher&quot; a few weeks later.
==Critical reception==

&quot;Young Americans&quot; was released to a generally favorable reception, particularly in America. &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted that the album would appease Bowie&#x27;s current fans and open him up to new ones. &quot;Record World&quot; called it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most compelling album to date&quot;; &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; Michael Gross said it was his best studio record since &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, while &quot;Cashbox&quot; praised Bowie as an artist. In their end-of-year list, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Young Americans&quot; the seventh best album of 1975.

Amongst mixed reviews, some enjoyed certain tracks but disregarded the collection as a whole. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Landau praised the title track and thought that the remainder of the album &quot;works best when Bowie combines his renewed interest in soul with his knowledge of English pop, rather than opting entirely for one or the other&quot;. Ray Fox-Cumming of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described the sound as &quot;spasmodic, awkward, frustrating&quot; and having &quot;a joyless energy&quot;. In &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Jack Lloyd called &quot;Young Americans&quot; a &quot;gem&quot; and a &quot;triumph&quot; filled with &quot;superb&quot; songs aside from the &quot;pretentious&quot; title track, but felt &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;Fame&quot; were out of place.

Several critics were negative. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau initially gave the record a C+ called the record &quot;an almost total failure&quot;, saying that &quot;although the amalgam of rock and Philly soul is so thin it&#x27;s interesting, it overwhelms David&#x27;s voice, which is even thinner&quot;. He nonetheless appreciated Bowie&#x27;s renewed &quot;generosity of spirit to risk failure&quot; following the disappointments of &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and &quot;David Live&quot;. He later amended his review to B- and said of the album: &quot;this is a failure.&quot; In &quot;Phonograph Record&quot;, John Mendelsohn criticised the lyrics, Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance, found the melodies &quot;as good as non-existent&quot; and the overall album very weak. In the &quot;NME&quot;, Ian MacDonald felt the record was more of a transitional one, created out of a confused state of mind not knowing where to take his career next. He enjoyed it despite its flaws. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Michael Watts praised the backing band but found the record too &quot;pastiche&quot; to be credible and Bowie&#x27;s worst release up to that point. In Canada, Bill Man of &quot;The Gazette&quot; was also disappointed, believing Bowie should &quot;focus his talents more directly&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Subsequent events===
Bowie continued developing the funk and soul of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, with electronic and German krautrock influences, for his next studio album, &quot;Station to Station&quot;. Produced by Harry Maslin, the album was recorded in Los Angeles from September to November 1975 and released in January 1976. Songs from the &quot;Young Americans&quot; period that foreshadowed the album&#x27;s direction included &quot;Win&quot;, &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot; and &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot; &quot;Station to Station&quot; continued Bowie&#x27;s run of commercial success, reaching number three in the US. However, his cocaine use continued throughout 1975, to the extent he had almost no recollection of recording &quot;Station to Station&quot;. After completing the Isolar Tour in May 1976, he moved to Europe to rid himself of his drug addiction.

Commentators have acknowledged &quot;Young Americans&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s first album that he performed as himself rather than as a persona. Sandford believed that Bowie showed maturity by not featuring Ziggy Stardust, which secured his breakthrough into the US market. Pegg says the album turned Bowie from &quot;a mildly unsavoury cult artist to a chat-show friendly showbiz personality&quot; in the US. Bowie, however, expressed varying statements about the album throughout his lifetime. In late 1975, he described it as &quot;the phoniest R&amp;B I&#x27;ve ever heard. If I ever would have got my hands on that record when I was growing up I would have cracked it over my knee.&quot; He further described it as &quot;a phase&quot; in a 1976 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. He later reversed his stance in 1990, telling &quot;Q&quot; magazine: &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have been quite so hard on myself, because looking back it was pretty good white, blue-eyed soul [and] it was quite definitely one of the best bands I ever had.&quot;

===Influence===
&quot;Young Americans&quot; has been called one of Bowie&#x27;s most influential records. With the album, Bowie was one of the first mainstream white artists to embrace black musical styles, paving the way for other artists to engage in similar styles. Daryl Easlea summarised in &quot;Record Collector&quot;: &quot;While all rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll was based on white men&#x27;s appropriation of black popular music, very few artists had embraced the form wholesale, to the point of using the same studios and musicians, as Bowie [did].&quot; Buckley commented that it brought fans of both glam rock and soul together in the wake of the disco era. In subsequent years, artists who experimented with funk and soul after Bowie included Elton John, Roxy Music, Rod Stewart, the Rolling Stones, Bee Gees, Talking Heads, Spandau Ballet, Japan and ABC. Bowie was also referenced directly by George Clinton in the Parliament song &quot;P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)&quot; (1976) and in the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). Clinton also used a modified version of the &quot;Fame&quot; instrumental for Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot; (1976), while James Brown used &quot;Fame&quot; riff verbatim for &quot;Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved)&quot; (1975). In 2016, Joe Lynch of &quot;Billboard&quot; argued that &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Young Americans&quot; as a whole served as an influence not only on other funk artists such as Clinton but also early hip hop artists and the West Coast G-funk genre of the early 1990s.

===Retrospective reviews===
&quot;Young Americans&quot; has received mixed reviews from critics and fans in later decades, being dismissed as a purely transitional record and an inauthentic excursion by an artist whose talents lay elsewhere. Others have criticised it for being inconsistent, and lacking strong songwriting and the musical cohesiveness of Bowie&#x27;s other 1970s albums. Douglas Wolk stated in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have the mad theatrical scope of &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; or the formal audacity of &quot;Station to Station&quot;; at times, it comes off as an artist trying very hard to demonstrate how unpredictable he is.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that &quot;Young Americans&quot; is &quot;more enjoyable as a stylistic adventure than as a substantive record&quot;. 

Some critics have viewed &quot;Young Americans&quot; as an overlooked album that occupies a troubled place in Bowie&#x27;s discography, being sequenced between Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy and Thin White Duke periods. Rob Sheffield opined that the album is &quot;easy to overlook&quot; because Bowie &quot;did most of these robot-soul space-funk tricks better two years later on &quot;Station to Station&quot;&quot;. Mark Beaumont of &quot;The Independent&quot; argued: &quot;Those rock historians who dismiss the album as a white elephant among Bowie&#x27;s 1970s output [...] underestimate its significance. Because this was Bowie&#x27;s first display of true fearlessness, rock&#x27;s most celebrated shape-shifter attempting his first real post-fame metamorphosis.&quot; Others agree that &quot;Young Americans&quot; deserves a spot in Bowie&#x27;s discography, with Sam Kemp of &quot;Far Out&quot; arguing that &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to imagine Bowie&#x27;s later albums without &quot;Young Americans&quot;&quot;. Positive reviews of the album say that it has aged well, even being considered by some as a masterpiece of white soul. In 1991, Jon Wilde of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; argued that, like Bowie&#x27;s other 1970s records, &quot;Young Americans&quot; was ahead of its time. The singer Bob Geldof said: &quot;&quot;Young Americans&quot; is a fantastic soul record, but soul with something else going on. There&#x27;s an edginess to it.&quot;

&quot;Young Americans&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s ninth best album in a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The magazine argued that its style shift helped introduce Bowie to a wider audience. That same year, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 175 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2004, the critic Charles Shaar Murray voted it the 88th best British album in a list for &quot;The Observer&quot;. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==

&quot;Young Americans&quot; was first released on CD by RCA in 1984, and then by Rykodisc/EMI in 1991, with three bonus tracks. The reissue charted at number 54 on the UK Albums Chart for one week in April 1991. A 1999 edition on EMI featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound and no extra tracks. The 2007 reissue, marketed as a &quot;Special Edition&quot;, included an accompanying DVD containing 5.1 surround sound mixes of the album and Bowie&#x27;s November 1974 interview and performances on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. In 2016, the album was remastered for the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set, which also includes an earlier, rawer-sounding draft of the album, titled &quot;The Gouster&quot;. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, both as part of this compilation and separately. On 7 March 2025, &quot;Young Americans&quot; will be reissued again as a half-speed mastered LP and a picture disc for its 50th anniversary.

The 1991 and 2007 reissues featured &quot;Who Can I Be Now?&quot;, &quot;John, I&#x27;m Only Dancing (Again)&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Me&quot; as bonus tracks; the latter was released in an alternate version with strings on the 2007 edition. The 1991 reissue replaced the original versions of &quot;Win&quot;, &quot;Fascination&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; with alternate mixes, but later reissues restored the original mixes. Another outtake, &quot;After Today&quot;, appeared on the 1989 box set &quot;Sound + Vision&quot;, as did the alternate mix of &quot;Fascination&quot;.

<text>Station to Station is the tenth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 23 January 1976 through RCA Records. Regarded as one of his most significant works, the album was the vehicle for Bowie&#x27;s performance persona the Thin White Duke. Co-produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, &quot;Station to Station&quot; was mainly recorded at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California, in late 1975, after Bowie completed shooting the film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;; the cover art featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was suffering from various drug addictions, most prominently cocaine, and later said that he recalled almost nothing of the production.

The commercial success of his previous release, &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975), allowed Bowie greater freedom when he began recording his next album. The sessions established the lineup of guitarist Carlos Alomar, bassist George Murray and drummer Dennis Davis that Bowie would use for the rest of the decade, and also featured contributions by guitarist Earl Slick and pianist Roy Bittan. Musically, &quot;Station to Station&quot; was a transitional album for Bowie, developing the funk and soul of &quot;Young Americans&quot; while presenting a new direction influenced by the German music genre of krautrock, particularly bands such as Neu! and Kraftwerk. The lyrics reflected Bowie&#x27;s preoccupations with Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleister Crowley, mythology and religion. 

Preceded by the single &quot;Golden Years&quot;, &quot;Station to Station&quot; was a commercial success, reaching the top five on the UK and US charts. After scrapping a soundtrack for &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, Bowie supported the album with the Isolar Tour in early 1976, during which he attracted controversy with statements suggesting support for fascism. At the end of the tour, he moved to Europe to remove himself from L.A.&#x27;s drug culture. The styles explored on &quot;Station to Station&quot; culminated in some of Bowie&#x27;s most acclaimed work with the Berlin Trilogy over the next three years. Positively received by music critics on its release, &quot;Station to Station&quot; has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. It has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2016 as part of the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set.

==Background==

David Bowie developed a cocaine addiction in the summer of 1974, following the release of the album &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. The Alan Yentob documentary &quot;Cracked Actor&quot; depicted Bowie on the Diamond Dogs Tour in September 1974 and showcased his mental state. Bowie said in a 1987 interview: &quot;I was so blocked ... so stoned ... It&#x27;s quite a casualty case, isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;m amazed I came out of that period, honest. When I see that now I cannot believe I survived it. I was so close to really throwing myself away physically, completely.&quot; After seeing an advanced screening of the film in early 1975, director Nicolas Roeg contacted Bowie to discuss a role in his upcoming adaptation of Walter Tevis&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;. Bowie accepted the role, and moved from New York to Los Angeles, California, where shooting was to take place.

On his arrival in L.A., Bowie stayed with Glenn Hughes, the bassist for the English rock band Deep Purple. He also visited his old friend, singer Iggy Pop, in rehab. The two would attempt to record some material in May 1975, but the sessions were unproductive due to Pop&#x27;s heroin addiction. Hughes told the biographer Marc Spitz that Bowie lived in an increasingly paranoid state, recalling he refused to use elevators because of his fear of heights. His addiction severed friendships with the musicians Keith Moon, John Lennon and Harry Nilsson; he later said: &quot;If you really want to lose all your friends and all of the relationships that you ever held dear, [cocaine is] the drug to do it with.&quot;

According to the biographer David Buckley, Bowie&#x27;s diet now consisted primarily of red and green peppers, milk and cocaine. Bowie later admitted that he only weighed about 80 pounds and was &quot;zonked out of his mind most of the time&quot;. Hughes said Bowie would not sleep for &quot;three to four days at a time&quot;. Stories, mostly from one interview—pieces of which found their way into &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;—circulated of the singer living in a house full of ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from the Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of the Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. In an interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1977, Bowie described living in L.A.: &quot;There&#x27;s an underlying unease... You can feel it in every avenue... I&#x27;ve always been aware of how dubious a position it is to stay here for any length of time.&quot; Three years later, he would tell &quot;NME&quot; that the city &quot;should be wiped off the face of the earth&quot;. In April 1975, Bowie announced his retirement from music, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve rocked my roll. It&#x27;s a boring dead end. There will be no more rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll records or tours from me. The last thing I want to be is some useless fucking rock singer.&quot; The biographer Nicholas Pegg attributes this quote to Bowie&#x27;s decaying mental state; his &quot;retirement&quot; lasted less than six months. Shooting for &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; began in June 1975.

==Development==
Bowie&#x27;s heavy drug use continued during filming. He recalled in 1993: &quot;My one snapshot of that film is not having to act...Just being me as I was perfectly adequate for the role. I wasn&#x27;t of this earth at that particular time.&quot; When shooting took place in New Mexico, he was reported to be in a much healthier state compared to his time in Los Angeles. During his days off from filming, he began writing a collection of short stories called &quot;The Return of the Thin White Duke&quot;, which he described as &quot;partly autobiographical, mostly fiction, with a deal of magic in it;&quot; he also recalled taking &quot;400 books&quot; for the shoot. He began writing songs throughout filming, including two—&quot;TVC 15&quot; and &quot;Word on a Wing&quot;—that would end up on his next album. On top of this, he was in line to compose the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In the film, Bowie portrays the lead role of Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien who travels to Earth in search of materials for his dying planet, eventually becoming corrupted by humans. Roeg warned the star that the part of Newton would likely remain with him for some time after the filming. With Roeg&#x27;s agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image over the next twelve months, as did Newton&#x27;s air of fragility and aloofness. Newton served as a major influence on Bowie&#x27;s next onstage character, the Thin White Duke.

Bowie&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;Fame&quot;, a collaboration with John Lennon, was a massive commercial success, topping the charts in the US. Bowie&#x27;s label RCA Records were eager for a follow-up. After completing his work on &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; in September, he returned to Los Angeles; his assistant Coco Schwab had recently acquired a house for him. Partly because of his drug addiction, his marriage to his wife, Angie, began falling apart. After recording backing vocals for Keith Moon&#x27;s &quot;Real Emotion&quot;, he was ready to record his next album.

==Production==
===Studio and personnel===
&quot;Station to Station&quot; was recorded primarily at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles. The studio opened in January 1975 and quickly became one of the city&#x27;s busiest studios, attracting artists such as Rod Stewart and Frank Sinatra. Cherokee was more advanced than Philadelphia&#x27;s Sigma Sound Studios, where Bowie had recorded &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975); it featured five studio rooms, 24-track mixing consoles, 24-hour session times, more space and a lounge bar. On arriving at Cherokee, Bowie sang a few notes in Studio One, played a piano chord, and said: &quot;This will do nicely.&quot; Producer Harry Maslin said the studio was chosen because it was new and quiet, with less paparazzi and media attention. With a more advanced studio and no time constraints, the ethos of the sessions became experimentation.
Maslin, who co-produced &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; on &quot;Young Americans&quot;, was brought back by Bowie to produce. Tony Visconti, who after a three-year absence had recently returned to the Bowie fold mixing &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and co-producing &quot;David Live&quot; and &quot;Young Americans&quot;, was not involved because of competing schedules. Also returning from the &quot;Young Americans&quot; sessions were guitarists Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, drummer Dennis Davis and Bowie&#x27;s old friend Geoff MacCormick (now known as Warren Peace). Bassist George Murray, a player from Weldon Irvine&#x27;s group, was recruited to play bass. Bowie would use the lineup of Alomar, Murray and Davis for the rest of the decade. In mid-October, pianist Roy Bittan, a member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, joined the ensemble at the suggestion of Slick. Bittan recalled: &quot;David knew we were coming to town and he wanted a keyboard player. It must have only been about three days. It&#x27;s one of my favourite projects I&#x27;ve ever worked on.&quot; Following the departure of Mike Garson, Bowie praised Bittan&#x27;s contributions.

Although &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised it was cut &quot;in 10 days of feverish activity&quot;, more recent scholarship contends that the album was recorded over a couple of months, with the sessions beginning in late September 1975 or early October and ending in late November. Initial working titles for the album included &quot;The Return of the Thin White Duke&quot; and &quot;Golden Years&quot;, named after the first track recorded. According to O&#x27;Leary, &quot;Golden Years&quot;, which Bowie began writing before he began filming &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, was completed in ten days and issued as a single while the album was still being finished. Recording for &quot;TVC 15&quot; began shortly after the completion of &quot;Golden Years&quot;.

A cover of &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;, written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington and first performed by Johnny Mathis in the 1957 film of the same name, was recorded during the sessions. Bowie was inspired to record it after he met singer Nina Simone, who had recorded her own cover in 1966. He recalled in 1993: &quot;Her performance of [&quot;Wild Is the Wind]&quot; really affected me. I thought it was just tremendous, so I recorded it as an homage to Nina.&quot; A guest during the sessions was Frank Sinatra, who praised Bowie&#x27;s recording of &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;. His feedback prompted Bowie to include it as the album&#x27;s closing track. While he had begun writing &quot;Word on a Wing&quot; during filming, both &quot;Stay&quot; and the title track were written and recorded entirely in the studio. The three tracks were composed throughout October and November, rather than in one quick rush. Slick stated: &quot;He had one or two songs written, but they were changed so drastically that you wouldn&#x27;t know them from the first time anyway, so he basically wrote everything in the studio.&quot;

===Recording process===

For previous albums, Bowie had maintained a relatively straightforward recording process. He arrived at the studio with tracks that were fully written and rehearsed, recorded at a brisk pace, and the sessions concluded quickly. With the massive commercial success of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, and a reissue of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; becoming his first UK number-one single, Bowie did not feel compelled to rush the process in L.A. He arrived at Cherokee with fragments of songs rather than finished compositions, changing them as recording progressed. He then gave the ideas to Alomar, who worked on the arrangements with Murray and Davis. After the backing tracks came saxophone, keyboard and lead guitar overdubs, followed by vocal tracks, ending with production effects. Bowie would use this new process for the rest of the decade. Alomar recalled, &quot;It was one of the most glorious albums that I&#x27;ve ever done ... We experimented so much on it&quot;. Maslin added, &quot;I loved those sessions because we were totally open and experimental in our approach.&quot; Slick contributed numerous guitar effects throughout the sessions. According to Bowie, &quot;I got some quite extraordinary things out of Slick. I think it captured his imagination to make &quot;noises&quot; on guitar, and textures, rather than playing the right notes.&quot; Both Slick and Maslin praised Bowie&#x27;s &quot;on-the-spot approach&quot;. Slick found no rehearsals advantageous, resulting in a cleaner performance.

Because of his heavy cocaine use, Bowie recalled remembering &quot;only flashes&quot; of the album&#x27;s production, not even the studio, later admitting, &quot;I know it was in LA because I&#x27;ve read it was&quot;. Buckley says that Bowie&#x27;s only memory of the sessions was &quot;standing with Earl Slick in the studio and asking him to play a Chuck Berry riff in the same key throughout the opening of &#x27;Station to Station&#x27;.&quot; The singer was not alone in his use of cocaine during the sessions; Alomar said, &quot;if there&#x27;s a line of coke which is going to keep you awake till 8 a.m. so that you can do your guitar part, you do the line of coke ... the coke use is driven by the inspiration&quot;. Like Bowie, Slick had only vague memories of the recording: &quot;That album&#x27;s a little fuzzy—for the obvious reasons! We were in the studio and it was nuts—a lot of hours, a lot of late nights.&quot; Pegg says there were several 24 hour non-stop sessions; one day, work began at 7 a.m. ending at 9 a.m. the next day. According to Spitz, at one point Bowie moved a bed into the studio. One day, recording moved to the nearby Record Plant Studios because Cherokee was already booked and Bowie did not want to lose momentum during the session. Maslin recalled: &quot;[Bowie] liked to work four days or so, very strenuous hours, and then take a few days off to rest and get charged up for another sprint.&quot; Cherokee co-owner Bruce Robb told Spitz: &quot;I&#x27;d come in the following day and they were all still working from the night before. I&#x27;d leave and they were still working.&quot;

===Mixing===
When mixing &quot;Station to Station&quot;, Maslin found using the 24-track mixing consoles a challenge, but they allowed flexibility. Richard Cromelin of &quot;Circus&quot; writes that having a large number of tracks allowed Maslin to &quot;waste&quot; a channel on one sound effect which could then be &quot;tampered with&quot;, leaving other tracks for use by double-tracked instruments and vocals. Bowie admitted to giving the record a commercial edge: &quot;I compromised in the mixing. I wanted to do a dead mix ... All the way through, no echo ... I gave in and added that extra commercial touch. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Speaking to &quot;Creem&quot; magazine in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that the album was &quot;devoid of spirit ... Even the love songs are detached, but I think it&#x27;s fascinating.&quot;

==Musical style==
&quot;Station to Station&quot; is often cited as a transitional album in Bowie&#x27;s career. Developing the funk, disco and soul sound of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, the album also reflects the influences of electronic and the German music genre of krautrock, particularly by bands such as Neu! and Kraftwerk. Bowie had exhibited avant-garde elements on the 1973 tracks &quot;Aladdin Sane (1913–1938–197?)&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. According to Robert Christgau, Bowie&#x27;s experimentation with African-American music styles had matured by the time he recorded &quot;Station to Station&quot;, as the record appropriated them &quot;in a decidedly spacy and abrasive context&quot;; he said it added soul to the &quot;mechanical, fragmented, rather secondhand elegance&quot; explored on &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973). Initial reviews of &quot;Station to Station&quot; considered it a &quot;dance&quot; album.
As a whole, reviewers have classified &quot;Station to Station&quot;″s music as &quot;glacial, synthesized funk-rock&quot;, &quot;avant-garde art-rock&quot;, space rock, &quot;a hybrid of electronic R&amp;B&quot;, &quot;eerie avant-pop&quot;, &quot;art-funk&quot;, and &quot;ice-funk&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes it includes &quot;everything from epic ballads and disco to synthesized avant pop&quot; while extending &quot;the detached plastic soul of &quot;Young Americans&quot; to an elegant, robotic extreme&quot;. Chris Randle of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; labeled the album &quot;robotic R&amp;B&quot;. Maslin told &quot;Circus&quot; magazine: &quot;There was no specific sound in mind. I don&#x27;t think [Bowie] had any specific direction as far as whether it should be R&amp;B, or more English-sounding, or more commercial or less commercial. I think he went out more to make a record this time than to worry about what it was going to turn out to be.&quot; Bowie remarked in 1999 that the music on the album has a &quot;certain charismatic quality to it ... that really eats into you&quot;.

The ten-minute title track has been described as heralding &quot;a new era of experimentalism&quot; for Bowie. The song is split into two parts: a slow, hypnotic march, introduced by a noise resembling a train—created by Slick on guitar using flangers and delay effects—before it abruptly changes to what Alan Light of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calls a &quot;celebratory groove&quot;, which lasts for the rest of the track. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; defined the track as a &quot;momentous prog-disco suite&quot; and a &quot;Krautrock disco opus&quot; respectively. With its krautrock influence, it is the album&#x27;s clearest foretaste of Bowie&#x27;s subsequent Berlin Trilogy.

The musical style of both &quot;Golden Years&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot; are built on the funk and soul of &quot;Young Americans&quot; but with a harsher, grinding edge. Bowie said the &quot;Golden Years&quot; was written for, and rejected by, American singer Elvis Presley, while Angie Bowie claimed it was penned for her. According to Pegg, the song lacks the &quot;steelier musical landscape&quot; of the rest of the album. Author James Perone argues &quot;Stay&quot; represents a merger of hard rock and blue-eyed funk. &quot;TVC 15&quot;, the album&#x27;s most upbeat track, has been compared to the music of the English rock band the Yardbirds. &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; contains funky elements in its electric guitar playing, while the rhythm section and acoustic guitar add a jazz flavour. AllMusic&#x27;s Donald A. Guarisco likens the music of &quot;Word on a Wing&quot; to gospel and soul; Perone compares it to the sound of American musician Roy Orbison. Both tracks have been categorised as hymns and ballads.

==Lyrics and themes==
While living in his cocaine-induced, paranoid state, Bowie did not sleep for days, often reading books one after the other. During a run-in with Jimmy Page in February 1975, Page discussed the works of the English occultist Aleister Crowley with him. Bowie, whose tracks &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; and &quot;Quicksand&quot; from 1971&#x27;s &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; had exhibited occult influences, immersed himself in Crowley&#x27;s works. He revisited concepts seen in &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;″s &quot;The Supermen&quot; (1970) such as German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s theory of &quot;Übermensch&quot;, or &quot;Superman&quot;, and studied new concepts such as Nazi fascination with Holy Grail mythology and the Kabbalah. Bowie would use all these ideas throughout &quot;Station to Station&quot;, with Pegg describing the album&#x27;s theme as a clash of &quot;occultism and Christianity&quot;.
The title track introduces Bowie&#x27;s new persona—the Thin White Duke—who became the mouthpiece for &quot;Station to Station&quot; and often during the next six months, for Bowie himself. The character, inspired by Thomas Jerome Newton, dressed impeccably in a white shirt, black trousers and waistcoat. Carr and Murray described him as a hollow man who sang songs of romance with an agonised intensity, yet felt nothing, &quot;ice masquerading as fire&quot;, exuberantly &quot;throwing darts in lovers&#x27; eyes.&quot; Commentators have labelled the persona &quot;a mad aristocrat&quot;, &quot;an amoral zombie&quot;, and &quot;an emotionless &quot;Aryan&quot; superman&quot;. For Bowie himself, the Duke was &quot;a nasty character indeed&quot;.

Despite the noise of a train in the opening moments, Bowie said the title of &quot;Station to Station&quot; does not refer so much to railway stations as to the Stations of the Cross, the series of 14 images depicting Christ&#x27;s path to his crucifixion, each symbolising a stopping-point for prayer. He added it was about the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, evident in the line &quot;from Kether to Malkuth&quot;, which bookend the Tree of Life: &quot;so for me the whole album was symbolic and representative of the trip through the Tree of Life&quot;. Pegg believes the song displays a combination of Christian and Jewish allusions. The song refers to William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Fixation with the occult was evident in such phrases as &quot;white stains&quot;, the name of a book of poetry by Crowley. Cocaine is also referenced directly in the line: &quot;It&#x27;s not the side effects of the cocaine / I&#x27;m thinking that it must be love.&quot;

Spitz interprets &quot;Station to Station&quot; as &quot;an album of love songs&quot;, specifically &quot;the kind you write when you have no love in your own life&quot;. Indeed, Perone considers &quot;Golden Years&quot; the type of love song that does not feature the word &quot;love&quot;. The song&#x27;s character assures his companion that he will always protect her no matter what and promises her a brighter future. Carr and Murray write it carries &quot;an air of regret for missed opportunities and past pleasures&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;Stay&quot; have been interpreted as reflecting on &quot;the uncertainty of sexual conquest&quot;, and as an example of &quot;the Duke&#x27;s spurious romanticism&quot;.

Religious themes, as well as belief in spirituality, are prevalent on &quot;Station to Station&quot;, &quot;Word on a Wing&quot;, &quot;Golden Years&quot; and &quot;TVC 15&quot;; for Carr and Murray religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to &quot;test his numbness&quot;. Bowie has claimed that on &quot;Word on a Wing&quot;, at least, &quot;the passion is genuine&quot;. There is a comedic flavour in &quot;TVC 15&quot;, which multiple commentators describe as a &quot;surreal comedy&quot;. It concerns a character&#x27;s girlfriend being eaten by a television. The song was inspired by a dream of Iggy Pop&#x27;s featuring a similar premise, as well as a scene in &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; where Newton fills a room with television screens, each tuned to a different channel. Pegg calls it the album&#x27;s &quot;odd man out&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album cover is a black-and-white photograph taken by Steve Schapiro on the set of the film &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot;, in which Bowie, as Newton, steps into the space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped monochrome image, feeling that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; an all-white border was placed around the image, which Pegg believes reflects the &quot;stark monochrome aesthetic&quot; of both the Thin White Duke character and the 1976 tour. He also contends that the monochrome cover matches the &quot;austere tone&quot; of the album. The full-size, colour version was used for some subsequent reissues of the album. The back cover&#x27;s photograph was taken in Los Angeles in 1974, also by Schapiro, and showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk. It was Bowie&#x27;s first LP not to include lyric sheets in the packaging, which was criticised in contemporary reviews by &quot;Street Life&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;.

==Promotion and release==

RCA released &quot;Golden Years&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single on 21 November 1975, with the &quot;Young Americans&quot; track &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot; as the B-side. On 4 November, Bowie appeared on the American television show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, miming to &quot;Fame&quot; and the then-unreleased &quot;Golden Years&quot;. Bowie was the second white artist to appear on the programme, after Elton John six months earlier. During the performance and interview, he was visibly drunk and, according to Pegg, was at a &quot;new low in coherency&quot;. Bowie later felt ashamed for his behaviour, recalling in 1999 that he had failed to learn the new single and was scolded afterwards by the show&#x27;s DJ. The resulting film clip was used as the song&#x27;s unofficial music video to promote the single worldwide. Commercially, &quot;Golden Years&quot; reached the top ten in the UK and the US but, like &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;&#x27;s relationship to &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974), was a somewhat unrepresentative teaser for the album to come.

Following &quot;Soul Train&quot;, Bowie appeared on &quot;The Cher Show&quot; on 23 November, performing &quot;Fame&quot; and a duet of &quot;Can You Hear Me?&quot; with singer Cher. He then appeared via satellite on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Russell Harty Plus&quot; five days later. At the turn of the new year, on 3 January 1976, Bowie and his band appeared on the Dinah Shore-hosted variety show &quot;Dinah!&quot; and performed &quot;Stay&quot;,—the song&#x27;s public debut. RCA released &quot;Station to Station&quot; on 23 January, with the catalogue number APLI 1327. It was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, remaining on the chart for 32 weeks. It became Bowie&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US until &quot;The Next Day&quot;, which reached number two in 2013. &quot;Station to Station&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 26 February 1976. In the UK, it charted for seventeen weeks, peaking at number five, the last time one of Bowie&#x27;s studio albums charted lower in his home country than in America. Elsewhere, the album peaked in the top three in Canada, France and the Netherlands, and the top ten in Australia, Japan, Norway and New Zealand.

The title track was released in France as a 7-inch promotional single in January 1976. It featured a shortened version of the track, lasting just over three-and-a-half minutes, with &quot;TVC 15&quot; as the B-side. &quot;TVC 15&quot; was released in edited form as the second single from the album on 30 April 1976, backed by the &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; track &quot;We Are the Dead&quot;. Its release coincided with the European leg of the Isolar tour. It peaked at number 33 in the UK. &quot;Stay&quot; was first issued, in its full-length form, as the B-side of the &quot;Suffragette City&quot; single in the summer of 1976 to promote the &quot;Changesonebowie&quot; compilation. An edited version was subsequently released in July as an A-side in the US and other territories, backed by &quot;Word on a Wing&quot;. It failed to chart. The song, however, did not appear on the compilation. (&quot;Changesonebowie&quot; was itself packaged as a uniform edition to &quot;Station to Station&quot;, featuring a black-and-white cover and similar lettering). In November 1981, as Bowie&#x27;s relationship with RCA was winding down, &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; was issued as a single to promote the &quot;Changestwobowie&quot; compilation. The full-length version of &quot;Golden Years&quot; backed the UK single. Accompanied by a new music video shot specifically for the release, it peaked at number 24 in the UK and charted for ten weeks.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Station to Station&quot; received positive reviews from music critics on its release. Paul Trynka says overall, critics acknowledged that Bowie was exploring new territories. Ian MacDonald noted Bowie&#x27;s musical growth in Britain&#x27;s &quot;Street Life&quot; magazine, recognising it as one of his finest albums up to that point. He believed it was the first album he&#x27;d released where it felt he had total control. Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Charles Murray praised the music throughout the record, but was critical of Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance, particularly on &quot;Word on a Wing&quot; and &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;. Another reviewer for &quot;NME&quot; found the album &quot;a strange and confusing musical whirlpool where nothing is what it seems&quot;, ultimately calling it &quot;one of the most significant albums released in the last five years&quot;. The magazine named it the second best album of the year, behind Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Desire&quot;. John Ingham of &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine gave immense praise to the album, naming &quot;Golden Years&quot;, &quot;TVC 15&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot; some of Bowie&#x27;s best songs up to that point and overall &quot;a great record of our time&quot;. Musically, he viewed it as a cross between &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; and &quot;Young Americans&quot;. Some reviewers found the lyrics&#x27; meaning difficult to comprehend, with Ingham citing &quot;TVC 15&quot; as an example. However, he felt it was part of the LP&#x27;s charm.

In America, &quot;Billboard&quot; felt Bowie had &quot;found his musical niche&quot; with songs like &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Golden Years&quot; but that &quot;the 10-minute title cut drags&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Teri Moris applauded the album&#x27;s &#x27;rockier&#x27; moments but discerned a move away from the genre, finding it &quot;the thoughtfully professional effort of a style-conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock &amp; roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms ... while there&#x27;s little doubt about his skill, one wonders how long he&#x27;ll continue wrestling with rock at all&quot;. Critic Dave Marsh was extremely negative, calling it &quot;the most significant advance in LP filler since Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; [1975]&quot;. Considering &quot;Word on a Wing&quot; the &quot;only complete success&quot; on the LP, he panned the tracks as overlong, unexciting and uninteresting, further arguing that &quot;it&#x27;s rather appalling that the best thing [Bowie] can think of doing with his talent currently is fool around.&quot;

Rock critic Lester Bangs, who gave Bowie&#x27;s work negative assessments throughout the 1970s, praised &quot;Station to Station&quot; in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, noting the presence of &quot;a wail and throb that won&#x27;t let up&quot; and &quot;a beautiful, swelling, intensely romantic melancholy&quot;, calling it his &quot;(first) masterpiece&quot;. In &quot;Circus&quot;, Cromelin, noting that Bowie was &quot;never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life&quot;, declared that &quot;Station to Station&quot; &quot;offers cryptic, expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer&#x27;s soul but never fully reveal his face&quot;. Cromelin also found allusions to earlier Bowie efforts, such as the &quot;density&quot; of &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, the &quot;pop feel&quot; of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, the &quot;dissonance and angst&quot; of &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, the &quot;compelling percussion&quot; of &quot;Young Americans&quot;, and the &quot;youthful mysticism&quot; of &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; (1969), concluding &quot;it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey&quot;. Ben Edmonds&#x27; did not find the LP one of Bowie&#x27;s best works in &quot;Phonograph Record&quot;, instead believed that &quot;Station to Station&quot; is merely a &quot;stopping place&quot; where he can reflect and plan his next musical journey, &quot;which his followers always expect him to make&quot;. However, he noted the album&#x27;s overall cohesiveness and praised the backing band, calling them Bowie&#x27;s finest since the Spiders from Mars. 

&quot;Station to Station&quot; was voted the 13th best album of 1976 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Reviewing the record for the newspaper, Robert Christgau expressed some reservations about the length of the songs and the detached quality of Bowie&#x27;s vocals, but deemed &quot;TVC 15&quot; his &quot;favorite piece of rock and roll in a very long time&quot; and wrote, &quot;spaceyness has always been his shtick, and anybody who can merge Lou Reed, disco, and Dr. John ... deserves to keep doing it for five minutes and 29 seconds&quot;. He ranked it as the year&#x27;s fourth best in his ballot for the poll.

==Subsequent events==

With the &quot;Station to Station&quot; sessions completed in December 1975, Bowie started work on a soundtrack for &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; with Paul Buckmaster, whom Bowie worked with for &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969), as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film&#x27;s music but found that &quot;when I&#x27;d finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people&#x27;s ... and I just said &#x27;Shit, you&#x27;re not getting any of it&#x27;. I was so furious, I&#x27;d put &quot;so&quot; much work into it.&quot; Notwithstanding, Maslin argued Bowie was &quot;burned out&quot; and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, &quot;There were pieces of me laying all over the floor&quot;. When Bowie presented his material for the film to Roeg, the director decided it was unsuitable. He preferred a more folksy sound, although John Phillips (the chosen composer for the soundtrack) described Bowie&#x27;s contributions as &quot;haunting and beautiful&quot;. In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into &quot;Subterraneans&quot; on his next studio album, &quot;Low&quot;.
With the soundtrack album abandoned, Bowie decided he was ready to free himself of Los Angeles&#x27; drug culture and move back to Europe. In January 1976, he began rehearsals for the Isolar Tour to promote &quot;Station to Station&quot;, which began on 2 February 1976 and ended on 18 May. Iggy Pop, who, like Bowie, was ready to quit his drug addiction, accompanied him on the tour. Due to disagreements with Bowie&#x27;s management, Stacy Heydon replaced Slick on lead guitar. Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Radioactivity&quot; was used as an overture to the shows, accompanying footage from Luis Buñuel&#x27;s and Salvador Dalí&#x27;s surrealist film &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929). The staging featured Bowie, dressed in the Duke&#x27;s habitual black waistcoat and trousers, a pack of Gitanes placed ostentatiously in his pocket, moving stiffly among &quot;curtains of white light&quot;, an effect that spawned the nickname &#x27;the White Light Tour&#x27;. In 1989, Bowie reflected, &quot;I wanted to go back to a kind of Expressionist German-film look ... and the lighting of, say, Fritz Lang or Pabst. A black-and-white movies look, but with an intensity that was sort of aggressive. I think for me, personally, theatrically, that was the most successful tour I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; The Isolar Tour was the source of one of the artist&#x27;s best-known bootlegs, culled from an FM radio broadcast of his 23 March 1976 concert at Nassau Coliseum. A live album, &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot;, was officially released years later.

Bowie drew criticism during the tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview, he had declared, &quot;Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars ... quite as good as Jagger ... He staged a country&quot;, but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Isolar Tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month in Stockholm, he was quoted as saying that &quot;Britain could benefit from a fascist leader&quot;. Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour ended, in the so-called &#x27;Victoria Station incident&#x27; in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in &quot;NME&quot;. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: &quot;Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it ...&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

&quot;Station to Station&quot; was a milestone in Bowie&#x27;s transition to his late 1970s Berlin Trilogy. Pegg calls it the &quot;precise halfway point on the journey from &quot;Young Americans&quot; to &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. Bowie himself said, &quot;As far as the music goes, &quot;Low&quot; and its siblings were a direct follow-on from the title track [of &quot;Station to Station&quot;]&quot;. For the Berlin Trilogy, Bowie collaborated with Tony Visconti and former Roxy Music keyboardist and conceptualist Brian Eno. Eno similarly felt that &quot;Low&quot; was &quot;very much a continuation&quot; of &quot;Station to Station&quot;, which he called &quot;one of the great records of all time&quot; in 1999. In an interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 1997, Bowie considered &quot;Station to Station&quot; a &quot;great, damn good&quot; album, but &quot;extremely dark&quot;. Because of his disconnected state during its recording, he heard it as &quot;a piece of work by an entirely different person&quot;.

The album has been described as &quot;enormously influential on post-punk&quot;. Carr and Murray wrote in 1981: &quot;If &quot;Low&quot; was Gary Numan&#x27;s Bowie album, then &quot;Station to Station&quot; was Magazine&#x27;s.&quot; Ian Mathers of &quot;Stylus&quot; magazine opined in 2004 that &quot;just as few had anticipated Bowie&#x27;s approach, few copied it ... for the most part this is an orphaned, abandoned style&quot;. Ten years later, NPR&#x27;s Jem Aswad described the album as &quot;pioneering ice-funk&quot; that &quot;paved the way not only for thousands of artists who were influenced by it, but also for the brilliant wave of experimentation that followed over the next five years: &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (both 1977), &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979) and &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980)&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers have described &quot;Station to Station&quot; as one of his greatest records. In his book &quot;Strange Fascination&quot;, David Buckley calls it a &quot;masterpiece of invention&quot; that &quot;some critics would argue, perhaps unfashionably, is his finest record&quot;. He finds Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance on &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; one of the best of his career. Paul Trynka was struck by the album&#x27;s innovation, noting &quot;a bizarre blend of spritely and monumental themes&quot;, and argues it &quot;marks the point at which David Bowie moved from pop musician to phenomenon&quot;. Marc Spitz acknowledges &quot;Station to Station&quot; as a &quot;gigantic creative leap forward&quot;, similar to &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; five years earlier. He praises the record&#x27;s timeless feel, the performances and the overall atmosphere, and considers it the first true new wave record. James Perone cites it as one of the most &quot;structurally coherent and broadly accessible&quot; records of the era. Peter Doggett argues that the new recording process Bowie used on the record allowed him to elevate it into a single unifying vision, as he had encapsulated on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Although Bowie would use this process for later records such as &quot;Lodger&quot; and &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Doggett believes these records are more fragmented than cohesive in the manner of &quot;Station to Station&quot;.

===Reappraisal===

Retrospectively, &quot;Station to Station&quot; is viewed as one of Bowie&#x27;s best and most significant works. Erlewine wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not an easy album to warm to, but its epic structure and clinical sound were an impressive, individualistic achievement.&quot; Alan Light called it both &quot;musically accessible and lyrically elliptical&quot;. In the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), Rob Sheffield considered &quot;Station to Station&quot; Bowie&#x27;s greatest album: &quot;[It&#x27;s] the album where Major Tom learns to dance, as the slick, robotic onslaught of the Teutonic title track fades into the tricky beats of &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Golden Years&quot;. In the Velvets-worthy &quot;TVC 15&quot;, Major Tom appears as a woman who beams herself to a satellite, leaving poor David stranded on earth. Highly recommended to MUD devotees and computer sex aficionados.&quot; Sheffield later deemed it a &quot;space rock masterpiece&quot; in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), writing Bowie had recorded &quot;the most intense music of his life&quot;.

In 2010, Paul Morley of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; praised its cohesiveness calling it a &quot;mesmerising album&quot; that is not only one of Bowie&#x27;s best, but &quot;maybe&quot; one of rock&#x27;s greatest. He argued it works as a capsule showing the artist&#x27;s mentally, and where rock music was, at the time he made it. In a 2013 retrospective for Rock&#x27;s Backpages, Barney Hoskyns called &quot;Station to Station&quot; &quot;one of the most impressive of his musical junctions: intense, passionate, focused, surging and urgently funky&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alex Needham said the album &quot;manages to incorporate almost everything fantastic about pop music&quot; in just six tracks: &quot;it&#x27;s dramatic, stylish, emotional and danceable&quot;.

Like his biographers, critics have acknowledged the album&#x27;s position in Bowie&#x27;s overall discography as the transition between the styles of &quot;Young Americans&quot; and the Berlin Trilogy. &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;″s Frank Mojica agreed, saying it offers &quot;an intriguing portrait&quot; of an artist&#x27;s transitional period, while also being an &quot;excellent album in its own right&quot;. Michael Gallucci of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; described it as &quot;the moment where his most unabashed commercial move gave way to his most don&#x27;t-give-a-damn experimental period&quot;, arguing the album marked Bowie&#x27;s transition &quot;from Rock Star to Artist&quot;. In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Station to Station&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s third best album. The magazine called it a &quot;deeply weird album that just gets better with age&quot;. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;″s Bryan Wawzenek listed &quot;Station to Station&quot; as his fourth greatest album, stating that although he made better albums in the years to follow, &quot;he made this fascinating album first&quot;.

===Rankings===
&quot;Station to Station&quot; has frequently appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 1995, it was ranked number 21 on &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums ever made, the highest ranked Bowie album on the list. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 323 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 324 on the 2012 revised list, and 52 on the 2020 revised list. In 2004, &quot;The Observer&quot; ranked the album number 80 on its list of the 100 greatest British albums. &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine placed the album on its list of 100 Essential Albums of the 20th century. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album 53rd in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine ranked the album 30th on their list of the 200 greatest albums of all time in 2015. A year later, the UK-based &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine ranked the album number five in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1970s. 

English writer Colin Larkin included &quot;Station to Station&quot; in the second edition of his book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (1998) at number 305. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissues==
The album has been released several times on CD beginning in 1984 by RCA, with the original black-and-white cover art. The album was rereleased in 1991 by Rykodisc featuring two bonus tracks: live versions of &quot;Word on a Wing&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;; this reissue charted at number 57 on the UK Albums Chart for one week. A 1999 rerelease from EMI featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound, but lacked bonus tracks. Both rereleases used the original, full-sized colour cover artwork. In 2007, the 1999 remaster of the album was reissued in Japan as part of the &quot;David Bowie Paper Jacket Series&quot;, which packaged Bowie&#x27;s studio albums from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; through &quot;Tin Machine&quot; in mini-LP sleeves; this release reverted to the 1976 cover art, which would become standard for later reissues.

&quot;Station to Station&quot; was reissued in 2010 in special and deluxe editions. The special edition included an &quot;original analogue master&quot; of the album (a newly prepared digital master sourced from the original tapes) and the complete 1976 Nassau Coliseum concert on two CDs. The deluxe edition included the special edition&#x27;s contents, on both vinyl and CD, alongside a disc of single edits and three further mixes of the album: a Dolby 5.1 surround sound mix and a new stereo mix, both created by co-producer Harry Maslin, and the 1985 RCA CD master. Both editions were released in September 2010. In &quot;The Complete David Bowie&quot;, Pegg is critical of Maslin&#x27;s remix. He writes that it &quot;surrenders all the subtlety of the original [mix] in favour of unimaginatively pushing everything to the front&quot;, resulting in a &quot;messy racket&quot;, particularly evident in the backing vocals for &quot;TVC 15&quot;. Although he notes that there is a different lead vocal take on &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;, he considers the new mix drastically inferior to the original.

In 2016, the album was remastered for the &quot;Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)&quot; box set, with standalone CD and vinyl releases the following year. The box set included both the original 1976 mix and the 2010 stereo remix of &quot;Station to Station&quot;, individually packaged. The sleeve containing the 1976 mix used the original cover art, while the sleeve containing the 2010 mix used a colour-corrected version of the 1991 front cover art; the back cover of the 2010 mix&#x27;s sleeve was a variant of the 1976 back cover, with burgundy text in place of bright red.

<text>Jujube ( or ; also known as jube or juju) is a gummy type of candy drop.

==History==

A recipe for &quot;pate de jujubes&quot; was published in 1709. The recipe called for gum arabic, sugar, and the date-like jujube fruit. In 1853, both &quot;ju ju paste&quot; and &quot;ju ju drops&quot; were sold by confectioners. Later, recipes used various flavorings instead of jujube fruits.

<doc id="1261557" wikidata="Q595352" url="?curid=1261557" title="&quot;Heroes&quot; (album)">
<text>&quot;Heroes&quot; is the twelfth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 14October 1977 through RCA Records. Recorded in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti, it was the second release of his Berlin Trilogy, following &quot;Low&quot;, released in January the same year, and the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. Sessions took place in mid-1977 after Bowie completed work on Iggy Pop&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. Much of the same personnel from &quot;Low&quot; returned for &quot;Heroes&quot;, augmented by the King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.

The majority of the tracks were composed on the spot in the studio, the lyrics not being written until Bowie stood in front of the microphone. The music builds upon its predecessor&#x27;s electronic and ambient approaches, albeit with more positive tones, atmospheres and passionate performances. The album also follows the same structure as its predecessor, side one featuring more conventional rock tracks and side two featuring mostly instrumental tracks.

The cover photo, like Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;, is a nod to the painting &quot;Roquairol&quot; by the German artist Erich Heckel. Upon release, &quot;Heroes&quot; was a commercial success, peaking at number 3 in the UK and number 35 in the US. It was the best-received work of the Berlin Trilogy on release; &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; each named it their respective album of the year. Bowie promoted the album extensively with television appearances and interviews. He supported &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; on the Isolar II world tour throughout 1978, live performances from which appear on multiple live albums.

&quot;Heroes&quot; has received enduring praise, particularly recognised for Fripp&#x27;s contributions and the album&#x27;s place within Bowie&#x27;s longterm artistic development. Though critical opinion has viewed &quot;Low&quot; as the more groundbreaking record, &quot;Heroes&quot; is regarded as one of Bowie&#x27;s best, most influential works. The title track, initially unsuccessful as a single, has remained one of his best-known and most-acclaimed songs. An altered and obscured version of the cover artwork was later used for the cover of &quot;The Next Day&quot; (2013). &quot;Heroes&quot; has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the box set &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot;.

==Background==

In the second half of 1976, David Bowie and his friend Iggy Pop relocated to the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France, to escape from the drug culture of Los Angeles. There, Bowie produced Pop&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1977) and recorded his own, &quot;Low&quot;, in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti; the album was the first in what came to be known as Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy.

&quot;Low&quot; was released in January 1977, receiving little to no promotion from both RCA Records and Bowie himself, who instead opted to tour as Pop&#x27;s keyboardist. After the tour&#x27;s completion, Bowie and Pop returned to Hansa Tonstudio in West Berlin, where they recorded Pop&#x27;s next solo album &quot;Lust for Life&quot; from May to June 1977. By the time he finished &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, Bowie was ready to begin work on his next record. He and Eno spent a few weeks devising concepts and ideas for the new album before they were joined by Visconti, who was busy with other commitments.

==Production==
===Studio and personnel===
For the album, Bowie, Visconti and Eno regrouped at Hansa Studio2 in West Berlin. Although the album was the second instalment of Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy, it was the only one recorded entirely in Berlin. The studio was a former concert hall converted into a recording studio that had been used by Gestapo officers during World War II as a ballroom. The studio was located about 500 yards from the Berlin Wall, leading Bowie to describe it as &quot;the hall by the wall&quot;. Describing how the location of the studio affected the creative process, Visconti recalled: &quot;Every afternoon I&#x27;d sit down at [a] desk and see three Russian Red Guards looking at us with binoculars, with their Sten guns over their shoulders, and the barbed wire, and I knew that there were mines buried in that wall, and that atmosphere was so provocative and so stimulating and so frightening that the band played with so much energy&quot;. Despite the dark atmosphere, Visconti particularly had an exciting time creating the album, saying, &quot;It was one of my last great adventures in making albums.&quot;
Most of the album was recorded with the same personnel as its predecessor &quot;Low&quot;, with Carlos Alomar, George Murray and Dennis Davis as the core band. Bowie played piano, having gotten significantly more experience playing the instrument during his time with Pop. An addition to the lineup was the guitarist Robert Fripp, formerly of the band King Crimson, who was recruited at Eno&#x27;s suggestion. The guitarist recalled: &quot;I got a phone call [from Brian Eno] when I was living in New York in July 1977. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. David said, &#x27;Would you be interested in playing some hairy rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guitar?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Well, I haven&#x27;t really played for three years – but, if you&#x27;re prepared to take a risk, so will I.&#x27; Shortly afterward, a first-class ticket on Lufthansa arrived.&quot; Upon his arrival to the studio, Fripp sat down and recorded lead guitar parts for tracks he had never heard before. He also received little guidance from Bowie, who had yet to write lyrics or melodies. Fripp completed all his guitar parts in three days. Fripp&#x27;s playing received significant praise from Visconti and Eno, who were impressed with Fripp&#x27;s ability to play for songs he had never heard before with such &quot;virtuosity&quot;. According to the biographer Nicholas Pegg, Fripp was not Bowie&#x27;s first choice. Michael Rother of the German band Neu! had originally been approached to contribute, but shortly before the sessions began, he was contacted by an unknown person and informed that Bowie had changed his mind, although later interviews with Bowie suggested otherwise.

While producing other Bowie records, Visconti found that new ideas were flowing at a consistent basis and because of this, sometimes they tended to be forgotten. In order to counteract this, he kept a two-track tape running at all times. Murray recalled: &quot;Tony had the insight to see what was happening in rehearsals so he just switched on the tape machines and let them run.&quot; Visconti himself later recalled: &quot;It came in handy so many times...because we&#x27;d get lost. We&#x27;d start with an idea then go in the wrong direction, and after an hour we&#x27;d say &#x27;How did this start again?&#x27;&quot; During the sessions for &quot;Low&quot;, Visconti became frustrated with the lack of studio staff present at the Château. At Hansa however, he was assisted by in-house engineer Eduard Meyer, whom Visconti recalled was critical in maintaining a positive atmosphere. Likewise, the mood during &quot;Heroes&quot; was brighter and more optimistic than the sessions for &quot;Low&quot;. Bowie in particular was in a healthier state of mind. He and Visconti would travel around Berlin frequently and one on such occasion, they met Antonia Maass, a local jazz singer who would go on to provide backing vocals on &quot;Heroes&quot;.

===Recording process===
According to the biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook, the recording process for &quot;Heroes&quot; began at a very quick pace, following along from &quot;Low&quot;″s process, with the basic backing tracks for side one being completed in just two days. Although he fed Davis&#x27;s drums through his Eventide H910 Harmonizer on &quot;Low&quot;, Visconti used it sparingly on &quot;Heroes&quot;, only during the mixing stage, and as such, the drum sound is atmospheric to the room; Davis also added congas and timpani to his set to take advantage of the large studio space. Visconti gave high praise to Davis, calling him &quot;one of the best drummers I&#x27;ve ever worked with,&quot; further calling Alomar and Murray &quot;amazing musicians...you&#x27;d just throw a few chord changes at them and they&#x27;d run with it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; later in the year, Eno said the initial phase of recording was &quot;all done in a very casual kind of way.&quot; Bowie gave &quot;very brief instruction&quot;, then the band would play. Hesitant at first, Eno found the process surprisingly effective, with most tracks being done in one take. Eno stated, &quot;We did second takes, but they weren&#x27;t nearly as good.&quot;

Overall, Eno had a much greater role on &quot;Heroes&quot; than he had for &quot;Low&quot;, being credited as co-author on four of the ten songs, leading Seabrook to call it the &quot;truer&quot; collaboration. Eno himself stated &quot;We both worked on all the pieces all the time.&quot; Eno would act as &quot;assistant director&quot; to Bowie, giving feedback to the musicians and suggesting new – and unusual – ways to approach the tracks. One of these ways was the employment of Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards. According to Chris O&#x27;Leary, these cards were &quot;part-fortune cookie, part-&quot;Monopoly&quot; &#x27;Chance&#x27; cards&quot;, intended to spark creative ideas. Although these cards were used greatly throughout the &quot;Lodger&quot; sessions, Eno and Bowie only used them on &quot;Heroes&quot; when creating the instrumentals, including on &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot;, &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot; and &quot;Moss Garden&quot;.

Following the initial sessions in July, recording for &quot;Heroes&quot; became more sporadic, with overdubs, vocals and mixing lasting until August. Like its predecessor, lyrics weren&#x27;t written or recorded until all but Bowie and Visconti departed. Seabrook characterises this stage of recording as &quot;sporadic bursts of inspiration surrounded by longer stretches of contemplation.&quot; When making &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot; with Iggy Pop, Bowie became fascinated with Pop&#x27;s ability to improvise lyrics while standing at the microphone. For &quot;Heroes&quot;, he decided to use the same method. Visconti later attested: &quot;He&#x27;d never have a clue what he&#x27;d sing about until he actually walked in front of the microphone.&quot; Bowie usually completed his vocals in only one or two takes; Visconti provided backing vocals in the same fashion. The final mixes were done at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, a studio that would become one of Bowie&#x27;s mainstays. An engineer at Mountain, David Richards, would also become one of his regulars. Richards&#x27; assistant was Eugene Chaplin, the son of silent film star Charlie Chaplin.

==Music and lyrics==
As the second release of the Berlin Trilogy, the music on &quot;Heroes&quot; expands on the material found on its predecessor &quot;Low&quot;. The songs have been described by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; as art rock and experimental rock, while also further continuing Bowie&#x27;s work in the electronic and ambient genres. Like its predecessor, the songs on &quot;Heroes&quot; emphasise tone and atmosphere rather than guitar-based rock. However, they are more positive in both tone and atmosphere than the songs of its predecessor; the author James Perone considers it more accessible, while Visconti described it as &quot;a very positive version of &quot;Low&quot;.&quot; Biographer Paul Trynka writes that the record evokes &quot;both past and future&quot;. It also follows the same structure as its predecessor, with side one featuring more conventional tracks, and side two featuring mostly instrumental tracks.

The author Peter Doggett writes that whereas &quot;Low&quot; featured lyrics of autobiographical nature, the lyrics of &quot;Heroes&quot; were &quot;oblique and often deliberately evasive&quot;, and were sung with an &quot;astonishing&quot; amount of passion. Visconti recalled that lyrics were made up on the spot, with Bowie sometimes ad-libbing entire songs, singing &quot;at the top of his lungs&quot;. Songs of this instance included &quot;Joe the Lion&quot;, a tribute to the American artist Chris Burden, who was known for his outlandish publicity stunts, and &quot;Blackout&quot;, which references the New York City blackout of 1977. Like the second side of &quot;Low&quot;, the imagery of the Berlin Wall dominates &quot;Heroes&quot; throughout; a kiss between Visconti and Maass at the foot of the Wall inspired a lyric for the title track. Bowie&#x27;s vocal for &quot;″Heroes″&quot; goes from calm and playful to a near-scream, a style he called &quot;Bowie histrionics&quot;. Musically, Fripp&#x27;s guitar feedback dominates throughout, while the bass pulsates and Eno synthesisers blends in the background. Bowie explained the song is about &quot;facing reality and standing up to it&quot; and finding joyness in life. David Buckley particularly highlights the lyric &quot;We can be heroes, just for one day&quot; as &quot;an acknowledgment that the future didn&#x27;t belong to him anymore, [but] to everyone&quot;.

&quot;Sons of the Silent Age&quot; was the only song written before the sessions began and was originally intended to be the album&#x27;s title track. The lyrics are influenced by the works of Jacques Brel and follow several characters that are, in O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s words, &quot;part-homo superior/part-Bewlay Brothers&quot;. Musically, the song is noted by biographers as different than the rest of the songs on the album, in that the themes present reflect ideals from the previous decade rather than the contemporary, while O&#x27;Leary likens its sound more to that of &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971) than the rest of the album. Biographers also consider the album&#x27;s closer, &quot;The Secret Life of Arabia&quot;, as a precursor to what Bowie would explore on &quot;Lodger&quot;.

The instrumentals are described by Buckley as dark and gloomy. &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot; puts a repeating four-note piano motif against a set of synthesisers to paint an image of a barren landscape. Bowie plays the Japanese instrument koto on &quot;Moss Garden&quot; which, together with synths, evoke a sound resembling aeroplanes flying overhead; Bowie further emphasises his fascination with Japan by stating he&#x27;s &quot;under Japanese influence&quot; in &quot;Blackout&quot;. &quot;Moss Garden&quot; segues into &quot;Neuköln&quot;, which is named after a district in Berlin. The track uses sound to capture the feeling of despair and desperation that the Turkish immigrants who lived there experienced.

The majority of &quot;Low&quot; was influenced by krautrock bands such as Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu! Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk name-checked both Bowie and Iggy Pop on the title track of &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot;, which was Kraftwerk&#x27;s response to the title track of &quot;Station to Station&quot;. Although the influence of Kraftwerk and Harmonia are less prominent on &quot;Heroes&quot; in favour of Edgar Froese, Bowie paid tribute by naming the album after Neu!&#x27;s track &quot;Hero&quot; from their album &quot;Neu! &#x27;75&quot;, while &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot; is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk&#x27;s Florian Schneider. However, many British listeners assumed &quot;V-2&quot; was a reference to the type of rockets used by the German army in World War II. &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot; is also notable for having an off-beat saxophone part played by Bowie, who began the take on the wrong beat but decided he liked it better and kept it as is.

==Artwork==
The cover photo was taken by Japanese photographer Masayoshi Sukita. Like the artwork for Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;, the cover is a nod to German artist Erich Heckel&#x27;s paintings &quot;Roquairol&quot; and &quot;Young Man&quot;. Pegg describes Bowie&#x27;s pose as &quot;a wild-eyed Bowie locked in a rigid pose of serio-comic agitation, raising a flat palm as though he has just mimetically lifted the final mask of artifice from his face.&quot; In an interview with Charles Shaar Murray of &quot;NME&quot;, Bowie said that the quotation marks in the title &quot;indicate a dimension of irony about the word &#x27;heroes&#x27; or about the whole concept of heroism&quot;. Visconti would later state that the album was &quot;heroic&quot; in that it was a very positive period of Bowie&#x27;s life and during the making of the album, everyone felt like heroes. Regarding the title, Bowie said, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d pick on the only narrative song to use as the title,&quot; quipping he could have titled it &quot;The Sons of Silent Ages&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The title track was chosen as the lead single and released on 23September 1977, with fellow album track &quot;V-2 Schneider&quot; as the B-side. It was released in a shortened edited form in the hopes of more airplay, but Buckley believes this edit results in the song losing some of its &quot;dramatic appeal&quot;. It was supported by a music video, shot in Paris and directed by Nick Ferguson, that features Bowie in the same jacket on the album cover against a backdrop of white light. For the German and French releases of the single, titled &quot;Helden&quot; and &quot;Héros&quot;, respectively, Bowie re-recorded his vocals in both languages, with lyrics translated by Antonia Maass for the German release. Despite the song&#x27;s later mass acclaim, it was initially a failure, peaking at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and failing to chart in the US. Pegg and Chris O&#x27;Leary note that it wasn&#x27;t until Bowie&#x27;s Live Aid performance in 1985 did the song become recognised as a classic. Bowie later remarked in 2003: &quot;This is a strange phenomenon that happens with my songs Stateside. Many of the crowd favourites were never radio or chart hits, and &#x27;&quot;Heroes&quot;&#x27; tops them all.&quot;
RCA issued &quot;Heroes&quot; on 14October 1977, with the catalogue number RCA PL 12522. Its release came amid the punk rock movement, whose music and fashion had been influenced by Bowie. RCA marketed &quot;Heroes&quot; with the slogan &quot;There&#x27;s Old Wave. There&#x27;s New Wave. And there&#x27;s David Bowie ...&quot; Trynka praises the slogan as &quot;a masterful piece of positioning that allowed David to remain aloof from a punk movement that, like glam before it, would turn into a parody of itself.&quot; Unlike &quot;Low&quot;, Bowie promoted &quot;Heroes&quot; extensively, conducting numerous interviews and performing on various television programmes, including &quot;Marc&quot;, &quot;Bing Crosby&#x27;s Merrie Olde Christmas&quot; (where he recorded &quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot; with Crosby), and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (where he performed the title track).

The album was a commercial success in the UK, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and remained on the chart for 33 weeks. It fared less favourably in the US, where it peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, spending 19 weeks on the chart. Doggett writes that the album ended a string of eight top 20 albums in the US, becoming his worst-selling album there since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. RCA released &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as the second single on 6January 1978, with &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot; as the B-side. It became a minor success in the UK, peaking at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, staying on the chart for three weeks. &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray remarked that its &quot;jarring, threatening edge...obviously put off a great many of the floating singles buyers attracted by the intoxicating romanticism of its immediate predecessor&quot;. The single was released in the US and Spain on a 12&quot; promo and in a five-minute extended form, which failed to chart despite having 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot; as the B-side.

==Critical reception==
On release, &quot;Heroes&quot; received very positive reviews from music critics. Allan Jones of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described it and its predecessor &quot;among the most adventurous and notably challenging records yet thrust upon the rock audience.&quot; Angus MacKinnon of &quot;NME&quot; called it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most moving performance in years&quot; and commended the artist&#x27;s growing maturity. Kris Needs of &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine further praised the record, noting that Bowie appeared to be continuing the musical explorations of &quot;Low&quot;, while at the same time, allowing listeners time to &quot;catch up with &quot;Low&quot;.&quot; Needs ultimately described the album as &quot;a strange, cold sometimes impenetrable album, but Bowie makes all these unlikely ingredients work.&quot; Writing in &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, American musician and author Patti Smith praised it as &quot;a cryptic product of a high order of intelligence.&quot;

The record was not without its detractors. Tim Lott of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; gave the album a more mixed assessment, calling it &quot;disjointed&quot; and criticised the instrumentals on side two as having less &quot;continuity&quot; than the ones found on &quot;Low&quot;. Lott further considered Bowie&#x27;s vocals &quot;hollow&quot; and the lyrics &quot;opaque&quot;. Overall, although he felt it was intriguing, he stated: &quot;As an album, &quot;Heroes&quot; stuns for just [the title] track. The rest is clever, but not brilliant and you expect no less from Bowie. In that sense it&#x27;s a disappointment, a come-down from &quot;Low&quot;.&quot; In the US, a reviewer for &quot;Billboard&quot; also gave a mixed assessment, calling it an &quot;extension&quot; of both &quot;Bowie&#x27;s cosmic rock vision&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;, and overall felt the record was &quot;a musical excursion into a realm only Bowie himself can define.&quot; In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Robert Hilburn lamented the way Bowie&#x27;s &quot;fluctuating pop interests caused him to shift from style to style faster than his ability to master them&quot;, ultimately calling it one of the artist&#x27;s &quot;least arresting turns&quot;. &quot;Creem&quot; Trixie A. Balm liked side one but dismissed side two, ultimately finding &quot;Heroes&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t rock&quot;. In Canada, &quot;The Gazette&quot;″s Juan Rodriguez commented on the &quot;melodramatic space-rock from the genre&#x27;s leading practitioner&quot;.

Some reviewers commented on Eno&#x27;s contributions, including Bart Testa of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who highlighted Eno&#x27;s involvement. He contended that after Bowie&#x27;s &quot;auteurist exploitation&quot; of the former on &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot; &quot;prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie&#x27;s dramatic instincts and Eno&#x27;s unshakable sonic serenity&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was less receptive to Eno&#x27;s contributions, particularly the second side&#x27;s instrumentals, saying that they are &quot;interesting background&quot; but &quot;merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged&quot;, in comparison to &quot;their counterparts on &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. &quot;Heroes&quot; was named album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. It also ranked tenth in &quot;Sounds&quot;″ year-end list. In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, &quot;Heroes&quot; finished 21st in the voting for 1977&#x27;s top album.

==Legacy==
===Subsequent events===

Upon completion of his promotional appearances for &quot;Heroes&quot;, Bowie recorded narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s classical composition &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, released as an album in May 1978. Bowie later said that it was a Christmas present for his son, Duncan Jones, then seven years old. He then played the lead role in the David Hemmings-directed film &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;. Released in February 1979, &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; was panned by both critics and audiences. Bowie himself was critical of the film, calling it &quot;my 32 Elvis Presley movies rolled into one&quot; in an interview with &quot;NME&quot;.

After filming his scenes for &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; in February 1978, Bowie began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. The Isolar II World Tour, also known as the Stage Tour, lasted from March to the end of the year. Songs from both &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; made up the majority of the shows, while &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;-era songs and other hits from 1973 to 1976 were played. By now Bowie had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that the tour was &quot;Bowie&#x27;s first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends&quot;. Performances from the tour were released on the live album &quot;Stage&quot; in September the same year, and again from a different venue in 2018 on &quot;Welcome to the Blackout&quot;.
===Critical legacy===

Although &quot;Heroes&quot; was the best-received work of the Berlin Trilogy on release, in subsequent decades critical and public opinion has typically fallen in favour of &quot;Low&quot; as the more ground-breaking record owing to its daring experimental achievements. Pegg writes that the album is rather seen as an extension or refinement of its predecessor&#x27;s achievements rather than a &quot;definitive new work&quot;. Seabrook notes that &quot;Low&quot; had the advantage of being released first and seen as &quot;the greatest and canniest musical move&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s entire career. However, compared to other records released in 1977, he writes that &quot;Heroes&quot; still &quot;sounds like a blast from the future&quot;. Perone finds that the mix of songs and instrumentals makes &quot;Heroes&quot; feel more &quot;integrated&quot;; having &quot;Sense of Doubt&quot;, &quot;Moss Garden&quot; and &quot;Neuköln&quot; flow from one to the next &quot;give[s] the listener the feeling that [the album] was...meant to be experienced as a unified whole&quot;. &quot;Heroes&quot; has nonetheless been regarded as one of Bowie&#x27;s best and most influential works.

Retrospective reviews praise Bowie&#x27;s growth as an artist and Fripp&#x27;s contributions. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album, noting the growing artistic maturity compared to its predecessor. He further praised the addition of Fripp, stating that his guitar adds a greater &quot;musical foundation&quot; to the electronic sound. He ultimately writes: &quot;The difference between &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; [essentially] lies in the details, but the record is equally challenging and groundbreaking.&quot; Ryan Dombal of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; similarly praised the record, calling Bowie&#x27;s vocal performances some of his finest and highlighted Fripp as the standout. In a review in which he commended the entire Berlin Trilogy, Dombal identified &quot;Heroes&quot; as the album that indicated the most artistic growth for Bowie, after turning 30 and escaping years of drug addiction. Many reviewers and biographers have particularly highlighted the title track as one of Bowie&#x27;s finest, with some considering it his greatest song.

In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s eighth best album. Five years later, the writers of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Heroes&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s fifth-greatest album, stating that &quot;The weary &#x27;optimism&#x27; of &quot;Heroes&quot; is mesmerizing. Even on its gloomiest tracks, there&#x27;s this upbeat, impassioned impression that everything&#x27;s okay, even just for one day.&quot; In 2020, Brian Kay of &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; ranked &quot;Heroes&quot;, along with &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Lodger&quot;, as Bowie&#x27;s seventh greatest work, calling the trilogy a &quot;fascinating chapter&quot; in Bowie&#x27;s life. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album 329th in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===Influence===
An early instance of the album&#x27;s influence was John Lennon&#x27;s comment in 1980 that, when making his album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;, his ambition was to &quot;do something as good as &quot;Heroes&quot;.&quot; The Irish rock band U2 chose to record their Eno-produced &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; (1991) at Hansa by the Wall in Berlin in honour of &quot;Heroes&quot; being recorded there. Other artists inspired by &quot;Heroes&quot; include Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who referred to the &quot;unconscious influence&quot; of Bowie on his singing style, Vince Clarke, who called it a &quot;rebellion inspiration&quot;, Ian Astbury of the Cult and Robyn Hitchcock. Scott Walker used &quot;Heroes&quot; as &quot;the reference album&quot; when making the Walker Brothers&#x27; &quot;Nite Flights&quot; (1978), according to engineer Steve Parker.
In 1997, American composer Philip Glass adapted the album into a classical piece entitled &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot; Symphony&quot;. A follow-up to his earlier 1992 adaptation of &quot;Low&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;Low&quot; Symphony&quot;, the piece is separated into six movements, each named after tracks on &quot;Heroes&quot;. Like its predecessor, Glass acknowledged Eno&#x27;s contributions as equal to Bowie&#x27;s on the original album and credited the movements to the two equally. Unlike the &quot;&quot;Low&quot; Symphony&quot;, the &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot; Symphony&quot; was developed into a ballet by American choreographer Twyla Tharp. Both the ballet and &quot;Symphony&quot; were greeted with acclaim. Bowie and Glass remained in contact with each other until 2003 and discussed making a third symphony, which never came to fruition. After Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, Glass stated the two had talked about adapting &quot;Lodger&quot; for the third symphony, which adapted as his 12th symphony in 2019. Glass described &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; as &quot;part of the new classics of our time&quot;.

The cover of Bowie&#x27;s 2013 album, &quot;The Next Day&quot;, is an altered and obscured version of the &quot;Heroes&quot; cover. This version has the word &quot;&#x27;Heroes&#x27;&quot; crossed out and Bowie&#x27;s face obscured by an opaque white box reading &quot;The Next Day&quot;. Designer Jonathan Barnbrook explained that Bowie had a feeling of isolation when making &quot;Heroes&quot; and he wanted to recapture that feeling for &quot;The Next Day&quot;. He further emphasised: &quot;We tried out every single Bowie cover there&#x27;s been, but it ended up as &quot;Heroes&quot; because it&#x27;s such an iconic album, and the image on the front has the right kind of distance...&quot;The Next Day&quot;, in combination with the &quot;Heroes&quot; image, and what the album is saying about somebody who&#x27;s looking back at his age...it just felt appropriate.&quot;

==Reissues==
&quot;Heroes&quot; has been reissued several times. RCA reissued the album on vinyl in 1980 and released it on compact disc for the first time in the mid-1980s. It was subsequently reissued in 1991 by Rykodisc with two bonus tracks, including the outtake &quot;Abdulmajid&quot;. A further CD release in 1999 by EMI/Virgin, without bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally remastered sound.

In 2017, the album was remastered for the &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot; box set released by Parlophone that September. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately in February 2018. A volume shift in the 2017 remaster of the title track received ire from fans and critics, but Parlophone proceeded to describe it as intentional and unalterable, because of damages in the original master tapes. After the critical voices would not lessen, a statement was released on the official Bowie website announcing corrected replacement disks for the &quot;Heroes&quot; CD and LP; the replacement disc offer lasted until June 2018. The amended remaster featured on the replacement discs was also used for the standalone CD and LP release of &quot;Heroes&quot; in February 2018.

<text>Gary Carr (born August 14, 1955) is a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2003, and served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 2004 to early 2006. Gary Carr is currently the Chair of the Regional Municipality of Halton.

==Background==
Carr has a certificate in Business Administration from Ryerson University, and was a businessman and sales manager in the transportation industry before entering public life. He continued his education as a politician, and received an MBA from Athabasca University in 2002. Carr also played professional ice hockey for five years in the farm teams of the Boston Bruins and Quebec Nordiques. In 1975, he was a Memorial Cup champion as a member of the Toronto Marlboros.

==Provincial politics==
Carr was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Doug Carrothers by 108 votes in the riding of Oakville South. From 1993 to 1995, he was his party&#x27;s Deputy House Leader.

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Mike Harris in the provincial election of 1995, and Carr was easily re-elected. He was appointed as a parliamentary assistant to the Solicitor-General for the entire term.

Carr was again re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Kevin Flynn by over 13,000 votes. He was chosen as Speaker of the legislature on October 20, 1999, and held this position for the entirety of the parliament which followed.

Like his predecessor Chris Stockwell, Carr was known as an impartial Speaker who was willing to criticize his own government. In 2003, he alienated several members of the Progressive Conservative Party by ruling that the government of Ernie Eves had committed a prima facie act of contempt against the legislature by holding its budget announcement at the headquarters of Magna International, rather than in the legislature itself. He was critical of the direction taken by the Progressive Conservative Party in this period, and did not seek re-election in 2003. He left politics and briefly coached the London Racers hockey team in London, UK.

==Federal politics==
In 2004 Carr was recruited to run as a Liberal in the riding of Halton, which bordered his old provincial riding. He defeated Conservative candidate Dean Martin in the election. Carr was defeated in the 2006 election by Conservative challenger Garth Turner.

==Halton regional chair==
Gary Carr was elected as Chair of Halton Region on November 13, 2006. Carr overwhelmingly defeated former Halton Region CAO Brent Marshall, who resigned from his position as CAO to run against Carr. Carr was sworn in as the Regional Chairman on December 6, 2006.

<doc id="1261561" wikidata="Q1342720" url="?curid=1261561" title="Lodger (album)">
<text>Lodger is the thirteenth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 25 May 1979 through RCA Records. Recorded in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti, it was the final release of his Berlin Trilogy, following &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (both 1977). Sessions took place in Switzerland in September 1978 during a break in the Isolar II world tour, and in New York City in March 1979 at the tour&#x27;s end. Most of the same personnel from prior releases returned, and the future King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew joined from the tour. The sessions saw the use of techniques inspired by Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards, such as having the musicians swap instruments and playing old songs backwards.

The music on &quot;Lodger&quot; is based in art rock and experimental rock. It lacks the electronic and ambient styles and the song/instrumental split of its two predecessors, favouring more conventional song structures and exploring styles such as avant-pop, world and new wave music. Lyrically, the album is divided into two major themes: travel (side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (side two). The pop artist Derek Boshier took the cover photo, portraying Bowie as an accident victim across the gatefold sleeve.

&quot;Lodger&quot; was a modest commercial success, peaking at number 4 in the UK and number 20 in the US. It produced four singles, including the UK top 10 hit &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;. Music videos directed by David Mallet accompanied three of the four singles. The album initially received mixed critical reviews, with many calling it the weakest of the Berlin Trilogy. Reception has grown in subsequent decades and it is now widely considered to be among Bowie&#x27;s most underrated albums. Its world elements have been highlighted as particularly influential. Bowie and Visconti were dissatisfied with the album&#x27;s original mix and, in 2015, Visconti remixed the album with Bowie&#x27;s approval for inclusion on the 2017 box set &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot;, along with a remaster of the original.

==Background==

In the second half of 1976, David Bowie and his friend Iggy Pop relocated to the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France, to escape from the drug culture of Los Angeles. There, Bowie produced Pop&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1977) and recorded his own, &quot;Low&quot;, in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti; the album came to be known as the first in Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy. After &quot;Low&quot;″s release in January 1977, Bowie toured with Pop before co-producing his second solo album &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1977), at Hansa Tonstudio in West Berlin.

Bowie&#x27;s productivity continued throughout the rest of 1977. He recorded his second Berlin release with Visconti and Eno, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;, released in October 1977, after which he conducted extensive promotion for the album. These included a collaboration with the singer Bing Crosby on &quot;Bing Crosby&#x27;s Merrie Olde Christmas&quot; television special (&quot;Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy&quot;), and contributing narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s classical composition &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, released as an album in May 1978. He also starred in the David Hemmings film &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;, and toured &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; on the Isolar II world tour from March 1978 to the end of the year.

==Recording and production==
Recording for &quot;Lodger&quot; began during the four-month break in the Isolar II world tour during September 1978. Although &quot;Lodger&quot; is known as the final release of the Berlin Trilogy, it was largely recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, with additional recording to finish the album at the Record Plant in New York City. The atmosphere in Montreux was very different from that in Berlin; the studio was built on the site of a previous studio that had burned down. Whereas Hansa Tonstudio was located near the Berlin Wall, Mountain Studios was located in an Alpine retreat. The guitarist Carlos Alomar described the location as &quot;boring&quot;, preferring the &quot;excitement&quot; of Hansa. Mountain also lacked the Hansa&#x27;s acoustics.
Many of the same musicians from the previous records—Eno, Visconti, Alomar, Dennis Davis and George Murray —returned for the &quot;Lodger&quot; sessions. A new addition was the future King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew, whom Bowie had &quot;poached&quot; while the guitarist was touring with Frank Zappa; Belew&#x27;s eventual bandmate Robert Fripp played guitar on &quot;Heroes&quot;. Much of Belew&#x27;s work on &quot;Lodger&quot; was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key. Belew recalled, &quot;When I arrived, they had about twenty tracks already done: bass, drums, rhythm guitar, but no vocals. They said, &#x27;We&#x27;re not going to let you hear these songs. We want you to go into the studio and play accidentally – whatever occurs to you&#x27;.&quot; Belew described the final guitar solo on &quot;D.J.&quot; as sounding like &quot;you&#x27;re changing channel on the radio and each channel has a different guitar solo on it&quot;.
The sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilise techniques from Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards. According to the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary, these cards were &quot;part-fortune cookie, part-&quot;Monopoly&quot; &#x27;Chance&#x27; cards&quot;, intended to spark creative ideas. Eno and Bowie used them previously to create some of the instrumentals for &quot;Heroes&quot;. Using the cards, Bowie and Eno conducted numerous experimental methods during the sessions. Some of these included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians swap instruments, as Alomar and Davis did on &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;. The pianist Sean Mayes explained: &quot;[Bowie] was very keen on spontaneity. He liked everything to be recorded in one or two takes, mistakes and all.&quot; The biographer Nicholas Pegg writes that several songs, including &quot;African Night Flight&quot;, &quot;Yassassin&quot; and &quot;Red Sails&quot;, were composed &quot;around a melodic clash of disparate cultures&quot;. Due to the experimental nature of the sessions, initial working titles for the album included &quot;Planned Accidents&quot; and &quot;Despite Straight Lines&quot;. Unlike the lyrics for &quot;Heroes&quot;, which Bowie largely improvised as he stood next to the microphone, he wrote most of &quot;Lodger&quot;″s lyrics at a later date; they were unknown during the Mountain sessions. Other than &quot;Yassassin&quot; and &quot;Red Sails&quot;, most of the tracks were recorded with working titles.

Alongside the use of Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards, Visconti recalled Eno having more leeway during the sessions than those for &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;. For &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, Eno gave the backing band eight of his favourite chords and instructed them to &quot;play something funky&quot;. Alomar disliked this, telling biographer David Buckley that he &quot;totally, totally resisted it&quot;. Despite Eno assuming control at certain points, he appeared on, and co-wrote, only six of the album&#x27;s ten tracks. Eno felt the trilogy had &quot;petered out&quot; by &quot;Lodger&quot;, and Belew also observed Eno&#x27;s and Bowie&#x27;s working relationship closing down: &quot;They didn&#x27;t quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn&#x27;t seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the &quot;Heroes&quot; album.&quot; Visconti shared similar sentiments, saying on multiple occasions: &quot;I don&#x27;t think [David&#x27;s] heart was in &quot;Lodger&quot;.&quot; &quot;We had fun, but nevertheless an ominous feeling pervaded the album for me.&quot;

The sessions at Mountain Studios lasted three weeks, after which the band went back on tour. At the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Bowie reconvened at the Record Plant in March 1979, where he recorded his lyrics and instrumental overdubs, and began mixing. Belew returned to record further guitar overdubs while Visconti recorded a replacement bass guitar part for &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; after Bowie decided Davis&#x27; original was unsuitable; work was completed in a week. Visconti recalled having &quot;sonic problems&quot; during the mixing stage because the studio did not have the technical advancements of European studios.

==Musical style==

Much like its two predecessors, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; described the music on &quot;Lodger&quot; as art rock and experimental rock. However, the album abandons the electronic and ambient styles and the song/instrumental split that defined the two earlier works, in favour of more conventional song structures. Visconti explained: &quot;We dropped the ambient-side-two concept and just recorded songs!&quot; As such, &quot;Lodger&quot; is the most &quot;accessible&quot; record of the Berlin Trilogy; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the songs as &quot;twisted avant-pop&quot;, while Belew similarly characterised them as &quot;avant-garde pop music&quot;. Its musical textures, particularly on &quot;African Night Flight&quot;, have been cited as presaging the popularity of world music, Bowie himself considered the album a forerunner of the sounds developed by Eno and David Byrne for &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot; (1981). Frank Mastropolo of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; wrote that &quot;Lodger&quot; combines world and new wave music into a &quot;pop format&quot;. Although Bryan Wawzenek, also of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, found &quot;Lodger&quot; to be the more accessible record of the Berlin Trilogy, he also felt it to be the most experimental, observing elements of Middle Eastern music, reggae, world and krautrock within the vast array of pop songs. Biographers have singled out the final track on &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;The Secret Life of Arabia&quot;, in particular, as a precursor to what Bowie would explore on &quot;Lodger&quot;, both musically and thematically.

After the ominousness of &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, biographers have described the opening track, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, as &quot;surprisingly delicate&quot; and &quot;serene&quot;; a thought author Peter Doggett believes implies a &quot;less intense&quot; record. The song shares the same chord sequence as &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and features three different players playing mandolin parts; each part was triple-tracked to create a total of nine parts. Bowie composed &quot;Move On&quot; after accidentally playing his earlier composition &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; backwards, then having Alomar write out the reversed chord sequence. &quot;Yassassin&quot; combines funk and reggae, using a violin played by Simon House to create a sound reminiscent of a Middle Eastern folk song and Turkish music. In part, the music of German band Neu! inspired &quot;Red Sails&quot;, sharing their distinctive &quot;motorik&quot; drum beat; Pegg describes it as &quot;an upbeat slab of new wave pop&quot;. The track has also been compared with Harmonia&#x27;s 1975 track &quot;Monza (Rauf und Runter)&quot;.

Bowie said that &quot;D.J.&quot; was &quot;somewhat cynical&quot; and his &quot;natural response to disco&quot;. Bowie mimics David Byrne of Talking Heads in his vocal performance. Wawzenek highlighted &quot;D.J.&quot; as a &quot;danceable gem&quot;. Doggett describes &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; as &quot;propulsive and impatient&quot;, while Ned Raggett of AllMusic called it a &quot;sharp-edged, thrillingly modern rock song&quot;. O&#x27;Leary particularly highlights Davis&#x27; drumming as the standout, while Alomar&#x27;s guitar solo was influenced by John Lennon&#x27;s rhythm guitar work in the Beatles. &quot;The Quietus&quot; found &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; to contain elements of glam rock and garage rock. For the recording, which has the same chord sequence as &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, Bowie instructed the band to swap instruments. &quot;Repetition&quot; features a bass guitar riff that is described by Buckley as &quot;insistent and very odd&quot;. Doggett highlights its sound as similar to funk music. &quot;Red Money&quot; is built around the backing track of &quot;Sister Midnight&quot;, an Iggy Pop song he recorded with Bowie for &quot;The Idiot&quot;. New guitar parts were added, along with electronic effects, backwards guitar and vocal harmonies.

==Lyrics and themes==
Though missing the song/instrumental split that characterised &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Lodger&quot; has been interpreted as covering two major themes— travel and critiques of Western civilisation on sides one and two, respectively. In early 1977, Bowie said, &quot;I don&#x27;t live anywhere, really. I travel 100% of the time,&quot; further noting, &quot;The more I travel, the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable. All my traveling is done on the basis of wanting to get my ideas for writing from real events rather than from going back to a system from whence it came.&quot; Because of this, &quot;Lodger&quot; is interpreted by some as a concept album. Some songs showcase heavily politicised lyrics, including &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, which deals with the &quot;depression&quot; brought on by Cold War leaders and the possibility of nuclear war, and &quot;Repetition&quot;, which deals with domestic violence. James E. Perone finds a general theme of political oppression and insanity. Eno was unhappy with the direction Bowie took for the lyrics.

Regarding side one&#x27;s theme of travel, Pegg writes that the songs revive a &quot;perennial motif&quot; prevailing throughout the Berlin Trilogy, highlighting the line, &quot;I&#x27;ve lived all over the world, I&#x27;ve left every place&quot; from the &quot;Low&quot; track &quot;Be My Wife&quot;, pointing out the journey is both metaphorical and geographical. Between the Montreaux and New York sessions, Bowie traveled to Kenya with his son Duncan Jones, which inspired the lyrics for &quot;African Night Flight&quot;. The same trip, along with ones to Japan and Australia, inspired &quot;Move On&quot;, which reflects the theme of wanderlust throughout side one. Regarding the song titles, Doggett quips, &quot;After his &#x27;African Night Flight&#x27;, what else to do but &#x27;Move On&#x27;!&quot; When asked about &quot;Red Sails&quot;, Bowie said in 1979: &quot;Here we took a new German music feel and put it against the idea of a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling Errol Flynn, and put him in the China Sea. We have a lovely cross-reference of cultures. I honestly don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s about.&quot; Pegg writes that &quot;Red Sails&quot; symbolises Bowie&#x27;s venture away from the mainstream. &quot;Yassassin&quot; is Turkish for &#x27;long live&#x27;, from the word . Like the instrumental &quot;Heroes&quot; track &quot;Neuköln&quot;, the song is about the discrimination Turkish immigrants who lived in Berlin faced, although its lyrical approach is more direct.

The lyrics of side two primarily critique Western society. &quot;D.J.&quot; takes a sardonic look at the world of the disc jockey. On the song, the DJ is looked at solely for what he is on the outside: &quot;I am a DJ, I am what I play&quot;. Swiftly compared to Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Radio Radio&quot; (1978), writer Ian Mathers describes the song as &quot;a horror story about a human being reduced to nothing more than work&quot;. &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; sees Bowie encounter an angel of death who has come to claim his soul. &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; contains gender-bending lyrics, particularly, &quot;When you&#x27;re a boy, other boys check you out.&quot; In 2000, Bowie said of the track: &quot;The glory in that song was ironic. I do not feel that there is anything remotely glorious about being either male or female. I was merely playing on the idea of the colonisation of a gender.&quot; In &quot;Repetition&quot;, the narrator conveys no emotion when beating his wife, leading Buckley to describe it as Bowie at &quot;his most chilling&quot;. &quot;Red Money&quot; proclaims the message &quot;project canceled&quot;. Regarding the &quot;red boxes&quot; that appear throughout, Bowie stated: &quot;This song, I think, is about responsibility. Red boxes keep cropping up in my paintings and they represent responsibility.&quot;

==Artwork==
Bowie collaborated on the cover design for &quot;Lodger&quot; with English pop artist Derek Boshier, who would later design the artwork for Bowie&#x27;s 15th studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983). The original gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot by photographer Brian Duffy of Bowie in a tiled bathroom looking like an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose and a bandaged hand. This was inspired by the self-portraits of Egon Schiele. To accomplish the shot, taken in February 1979 at Duffy&#x27;s London studio, Bowie balanced himself on a steel frame while the photographer captured the image from above. The broken nose and facial morphing were accomplished using prosthetic make-up and nylon threads. Bowie&#x27;s bandaged hand was genuine; according to Pegg, he had burned it with coffee that morning and decided to incorporate the hand into the photo. At Bowie&#x27;s request, the image was taken in a low resolution with a Polaroid SX-70 type camera; outtakes from the photoshoot have appeared in the 2014 book &quot;Duffy/Bowie – Five Sessions&quot;. The front features a postcard with the album title in four different languages, enhancing its theme of travel. Inside the gatefold are pictures of Che Guevara&#x27;s corpse, Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s painting &quot;Lamentation of Christ&quot; and Bowie being readied for the cover photo. Rykodisc did not reproduce these images on their 1991 CD reissue.

==Release and promotion==
RCA Records released the lead single from &quot;Lodger&quot;, &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, with &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; as the B-side, on 27 April 1979. To promote the song, Bowie had appeared on &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; four days earlier. According to Pegg, he dressed in a &quot;1950s Mod-style suit&quot; that made him look like a &quot;fresh-faced schoolboy&quot;. David Mallet, who Bowie chose to direct a promo video for &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, directed the programme. The promo and his Everett performance were filmed back-to-back, although the former featured extra backup dancers who turned out to be Bowie in drag. The Everett performance, along with an appearance as the guest DJ on Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Star Special&quot;, helped &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; reach number seven on the UK Singles Chart, Bowie&#x27;s highest-charting single since &quot;Sound and Vision&quot;. However, due to the song&#x27;s gender-bending video and lyrics, RCA refused to release the single in the US.
RCA issued &quot;Lodger&quot; on 25 May 1979, with the catalogue number RCA BOW LP 1. Its release came almost two years after &quot;Heroes&quot;, marking the longest gap between Bowie studio albums since his second self-titled album (1969). Buckley writes that within that time, new wave had begun to emerge and overtake punk rock as the dominant genre, highlighting the likes of Blondie and Kate Bush. He also notes that music videos and artists who were influenced by the music on &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, such as the Human League, Devo and Gary Numan, had begun to gain popularity.

&quot;Lodger&quot; performed well commercially, peaking at number four on the UK Albums Chart and remaining on the chart for 17 weeks. It peaked at number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, remaining on the chart for 15 weeks. Throughout the year, Bowie was out-performed commercially by Numan, who had number one hits with Tubeway Army&#x27;s &quot;Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?&quot;, his debut solo album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, and its lead single &quot;Cars&quot;. Numan, a huge fan of Bowie&#x27;s, was antagonised by Bowie&#x27;s fans who viewed him as a mere copycat. Bowie himself criticised Numan, which led to a feud between the two artists that lasted for years. According to Buckley, Numan&#x27;s fame indirectly led to Bowie taking a more pop-oriented direction for his next studio album, &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980).

&quot;D.J.&quot; was chosen as the second single, with &quot;Repetition&quot; as the B-side, released on 29 June 1979, Pegg calls it a &quot;boldly uncommercial choice&quot; for a single. Appearing in edited form, the single stalled on the charts, peaking at number 29 in the UK. It was supported by a music video, also directed by Mallet. The video features Bowie walking down a road in London&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court, attracting surprised fans, interspersed with shots of him as an abused DJ. &quot;Yassassin&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in the Netherlands, backed again by &quot;Repetition&quot;, in July 1979. It failed to chart, but the Dutch single edit was later included on &quot;Re:Call 3&quot;, as part of the &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot; box set (2017). &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, with &quot;Repetition&quot; once again as the B-side, was released as the album&#x27;s fourth single in the US and Canada only, where it failed to chart. A music video, again directed by Mallet, promoted it. The video, inspired by Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), depicts Bowie as a painter in an attic studio whose self-portrait begins to decay and melt.

==Critical reception==

In contrast to the universal praise received by its predecessor two years before, &quot;Lodger&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics on its original release. Among the negative reviews, Greil Marcus of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;one of [Bowie&#x27;s] weakest ... scattered, a footnote to &quot;Heroes&quot;, an act of marking time&quot;, while Jon Savage of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; found it boring and &quot;a nice enough pop record, beautifully played, produced and crafted, and slightly faceless&quot;. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Red Starr described the album as sounding like &quot;a ragbag of rejects from previous styles&quot; with &quot;only occasional flashes of genius&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Billboard&quot; similarly noted &quot;the tone of the album is less foreboding than his more recent musical excursions&quot;. Although they considered this was both a &quot;continuation&quot; and a &quot;departure&quot; from his previous works, the magazine chose &quot;Lodger&quot; among their Top Album Picks the week of 9 June 1979. Paul Yamada of &quot;New York Rocker&quot; felt the album was a letdown compared to its two predecessors. Although he found some of the songs &quot;good&quot; and complimented its &quot;easy-listening&quot; nature, he noted the absence of the more &quot;challenging&quot; work on the earlier releases and found &quot;Lodger&quot; as a whole to be &quot;a frustrating but well-crafted LP that is much less than it appears to be&quot;. Sandy Robertson of &quot;Sounds&quot; felt &quot;Lodger&quot; has &quot;some ideas successfully realised&quot;, but as a whole is &quot;not brilliant&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Lynn Van Matre did not find it one of Bowie&#x27;s best.

The album did receive some positive reviews. Ken Emerson in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most eloquent&quot; record in years, while Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote favourably, stating that although the songs may seem impassive and not designful, he believed those qualities are &quot;part of their charm—the way they confound categories of sensibility and sophistication is so frustrating it&#x27;s satisfying&quot;. Tim Lott of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s simply appealing in such an unusual way that a clear definition is impossible, even when plotted against its own predecessors rather than &#x27;pop music&#x27; in general.&quot; He commended the variety of musical styles present but criticised some of the lyrics as lazy. William Carlton of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; hailed it &quot;Bowie at his best&quot;, praising the performances of Bowie and the band, and the various musical styles. A reviewer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; found &quot;Lodger&quot; &quot;uneven&quot; but ultimately &quot;more interesting and entertaining&quot; than its predecessors. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for the year&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Lodger&quot; finished at number 31. In &quot;NME&quot; list, it placed at number 40.

==Influence and legacy==
The consensus among critics at the time of its release was that &quot;Lodger&quot; was the weakest of the Berlin Trilogy. Biographer Paul Trynka states that &quot;Lodger&quot; lacked the &quot;sense of risk and excitement&quot; that had &quot;pervaded&quot; its two predecessors, which he partly attributed to the studio it was recorded at. However, soon after its release, &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray predicted that &quot;Lodger&quot; would &quot;have to &#x27;grow in potency&#x27; over a few years, but eventually, it will be accepted as one of Bowie&#x27;s most complex and rewarding projects&quot;. Indeed, &quot;Lodger&quot; has come to be considered as one of Bowie&#x27;s most underrated works. Wawzenek described it as Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) rather than his &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990). While biographer Christopher Sandford calls &quot;Lodger&quot; a &quot;slick, calculatedly disposable record&quot;, Buckley contends that &quot;its stature grows with each passing year&quot;, and Pegg sums up, &quot;undervalued and obscure practically from the moment of its release, its critical re-evaluation is long overdue&quot;.

In regards to the Berlin Trilogy as a whole, Seabrook finds that then and now, listeners come to &quot;Lodger&quot; expecting a &quot;resolution&quot; to the sounds and themes of its two predecessors, but do not get that. He further contends that it lacks the &quot;pioneer spirit&quot; of &quot;Low&quot; and the &quot;sheer gravitas&quot; of &quot;Heroes&quot;. Nevertheless, he considers some of the tracks, including &quot;African Night Flight&quot;, &quot;Repetition&quot; and &quot;Red Money&quot;, as among his best work of the period. Perone argues that &quot;Lodger&quot; is &quot;by far&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most lyrically and musically challenging&quot; album of his late 1970s and early 1980s output, further illustrating the influence of contemporaries on the artist. Trynka states that over the years, the album has attracted &quot;admiration&quot; rather than &quot;visceral love or hatred&quot;, and its sound is viewed as a forerunner to the sound of Talking Heads and Spandau Ballet. &quot;Lodger&quot; is one of Bowie&#x27;s most influential works according to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Biographer Marc Spitz agrees, citing its use of world music as influential on Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980) and Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; (1986). Spitz describes the album&#x27;s promotional videos directed by Mallet &quot;as innovative as anything Bowie had ever done before&quot;.

===Retrospective appraisal===
Retrospectively, &quot;Lodger&quot; has received more positive reviews. Upon the album&#x27;s 1991 reissue, Ira Robbins compared its accessibility to its predecessors and felt the songs were forerunners of &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; in 2004, Rob Sheffield praised &quot;Lodger&quot;, stating it &quot;rocks just as hard as &quot;Station to Station&quot; and &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;&quot;. He also commented on the &quot;razor-sharp musical corners&quot; and &quot;new layers of wit and generosity in the songwriting&quot;, highlighting &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, &quot;D.J.&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. Jon Dolan of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine considered &quot;Lodger&quot; to be a great end to &quot;[Bowie&#x27;s] best decade&quot;, calling it &quot;his last great album&quot;.

In 2008, Chris Roberts of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine felt that &quot;Lodger&quot; never received the appreciation it deserved, writing: &quot;Generally perceived as the afterthought of the legendary &quot;Berlin trilogy&quot;... &quot;Lodger&quot; deserves a room of its own in the critical pantheon.&quot; Ian MacDonald agreed, writing that it was always thought of as the &quot;anticlimax&quot; of the trilogy, but nevertheless, stating that &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t add up as a single listening experience, its parts are rarely without quality.&quot; Erlewine also gave the album a positive review, writing: &quot;It might not stretch the boundaries of rock like &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;, but it arguably utilises those ideas in a more effective fashion.&quot; Mike Powell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described &quot;Lodger&quot; as &quot;the first David Bowie album marketed as nothing more than an album of recorded music by David Bowie&quot;. He commented on the record&#x27;s accessibility compared to Bowie&#x27;s prior releases. Although he felt &quot;Lodger&quot; might always be remembered as the least &quot;essential&quot; effort of the Berlin Trilogy, Wawzenek concludes: &quot;as a postcard from one of Bowie&#x27;s most exciting phases, it&#x27;s a fascinating glimpse of the artist in the midst of a bold transition&quot;.

Electronica/techno artist Moby would later say the only reason he got his first job as a golf caddy was so that he could afford to buy &quot;Lodger&quot;, which had just come out at the time. American indie rock band Built to Spill referenced the album in their song &quot;Distopian Dream Girl&quot; taken from their 1994 album &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Wrong with Love&quot;. A few of &quot;Lodger&quot;″s songs influenced two English Britpop bands in the 1990s. Blur used the same chord sequence as &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; and &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; in their 1997 single &quot;M.O.R.&quot;. The song&#x27;s chorus also borrows the melody and call-and-response vocals from &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;; Bowie and Eno both received credit for &quot;M.O.R.&quot; after legal intervention. The lead singer Damon Albarn has cited Bowie as an influence. Oasis named their 1996 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot;, written by Noel Gallagher, after &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. American indie rock band Shearwater covered the album in its entirety at live shows and on &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; following Bowie&#x27;s death in early 2016.

In the 1990s, American composer Philip Glass adapted &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; into classical music symphonies, titled &quot;&quot;Low&quot; Symphony&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot; Symphony&quot;, respectively. Glass informed Bowie of the projects and the two stayed in touch with each other until 2003; the two discussed making a third symphony which never came to fruition. After Bowie&#x27;s death, Glass said the two had talked about adapting &quot;Lodger&quot; for the third symphony, adding that &quot;the idea has not totally disappeared&quot;. In January 2018, Glass announced the completion of a symphony based on &quot;Lodger&quot;. The work is Glass&#x27; 12th Symphony; it premiered in Los Angeles in January 2019. Like Glass&#x27;s other adaptations, the &quot;&quot;Lodger&quot; Symphony&quot; is separated into seven movements, each named after tracks on &quot;Lodger&quot;. The symphony marked the completion of his trilogy of works based on Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy.

===2017 remix===

Reviewers criticised &quot;Lodger&quot;″s original mix for many years, calling it &quot;over-cluttered&quot; and &quot;over-produced&quot;. Regarding the mix, Visconti stated: &quot;My only regret is that we went to New York to finish [the] album and it suffered at the mixing stage because New York studios simply were not as versatile or well-equipped as their European counterparts in those days.&quot; Bowie also expressed disappointment in the mix, citing distractions in his personal life at the time and the overall feeling he and Visconti had that the record did not come together as easily as its two predecessors. Bowie and Visconti began discussing the possibility of remixing &quot;Lodger&quot; during the sessions for Bowie&#x27;s 24th studio album &quot;The Next Day&quot; (2013) for a possible deluxe edition reissue, with the latter explaining: &quot;[It&#x27;s] an important record to both of us. David agrees it never sounded the way we wanted.&quot;

During the sessions for Bowie&#x27;s final album &quot;Blackstar&quot; in 2015, Visconti secretly began remixing &quot;Lodger&quot;. He presented the new mixes to Bowie, who approved of them before his death. Visconti finished the remix in late 2016 and included it on &quot;A New Career in a New Town&quot;. Erlewine praised the remix as &quot;dense and colorful without changing the feel of the original&quot;, helping to &quot;focus attention on an excellent record that often gets overshadowed by the three albums accompanying it in this box.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Kory Grow wrote that the new mix &quot;loosens&quot; the album&#x27;s sound, saying there is &quot;a greater emphasis on orchestral strings&quot; and the percussion &quot;sometimes comes out of different speakers&quot;. Grow further noted that the mix makes &quot;everything [feel] generally lighter&quot;, notably on &quot;Red Money&quot; and &quot;Yassassin&quot;. Overall, Grow gave praise to the new mix, calling it a &quot;brilliant new take&quot; and noting that the original now feels &quot;muddier&quot; by comparison. Chris Gerard of &quot;PopMatters&quot; also praised the remix, believing it &quot;drastically improved&quot; the record and is &quot;nothing short of revelatory&quot;. Gerard gave the most acclaim to &quot;D.J.&quot;, writing that its new mix gives the track &quot;more punch and clarity&quot;. Ultimately, Gerard felt the new mix is the highlight of the box set and gives &quot;Lodger&quot; enough recognition to be labeled as among Bowie&#x27;s finest works.

===Reissues===

&quot;Lodger&quot; has been reissued several times. Although the original 1979 vinyl release featured a gatefold cover, some later LP versions such as RCA&#x27;s 1981 US reissue presented the album in a standard non-gatefold sleeve. The album was first released on CD by RCA in the mid-1980s. Rykodisc and EMI reissued the album with two bonus tracks in 1991, including the outtake &quot;I Pray, Olé&quot; and a new version of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. Another reissue, without bonus tracks, was released by Virgin Records and EMI in 1999, featuring 24-bit digitally remastered sound. In 2017, the &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot; box set released by Parlophone included two versions of &quot;Lodger&quot;: a remaster of the standard album and a new remix by Visconti. The 2017 remaster was separately released, in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, the following year.

<text>Bartholomew Columbus (; ; ; ; – 12 August 1515) was a Genoese explorer and the younger brother of Christopher Columbus.

==Biography==
Born in Genoa in the 1461, Bartholomew became a mapmaker in Lisbon, the principal center of cartography of the time, and conceived with his brother the &quot;Enterprise of the Indies&quot;, a planned expedition to reach the Orient and its lucrative spice trade by a western rather than an eastern route. In 1489 he went to England to seek assistance from Henry VII for the execution of the expedition. He was taken by pirates and landed in England in a destitute condition, and on presenting himself at Court was unfavorably received. He then sought help at the court of Charles VIII in France, again without success.

Meanwhile, his brother Christopher was in Castile trying to persuade Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon to back the expedition. When word arrived in 1493 that his brother had succeeded, Bartholomew returned to Spain, where he missed Christopher, who had already left on the second voyage of his four to the &quot;New World&quot;.

Funded by the Crown, Bartholomew Columbus traveled to Hispaniola in 1494 to meet his brother, where he was appointed as an &quot;adelantado&quot;, a senior-ranking governor, during his brother&#x27;s absences. He founded the city of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola between 1496 and 1498, which is now the capital of the Dominican Republic. He was imprisoned together with Christopher and another brother, Giacomo (also called Diego), by Francisco de Bobadilla and returned to Spain in December 1500.

After the Court acquitted Christopher Columbus of all of the charges, the Crown funded Christopher Columbus&#x27;s fourth and last voyage to the West Indies. Bartholomew accompanied his brother on this final New World voyage, and was to be left with a garrison near the Belén River. Bartholomew&#x27;s men were attacked by the local Ngäbe leader, El Quibían.

On 30 July 1502, they arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. Christopher sent his brother to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored, a large trading canoe approached. Bartholomew Columbus boarded the canoe, and found it was a Maya trading vessel from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes – the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.

Following Christopher Columbus&#x27;s death in Spain in 1506, Bartholomew returned to the Antilles in 1509, accompanying his nephew Diego, but Bartholomew soon returned to Spain when King Ferdinand II of Aragon confirmed his concession involving Mona Island near Puerto Rico; the King would reclaim the appealing little island from Bartholomew&#x27;s heirs after Bartholomew&#x27;s death on 12 August 1514 (by which time Bartholomew had returned to Hispaniola).

Bartholomew Columbus had a natural daughter named Maria born in 1508 as the result on a relationship with Catalina Marrón. Nothing is known of them beyond a brief mention in Columbus&#x27;s will dated 1511.

==Legacy==
The island of Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean was named in his honour by Christopher Columbus.

<doc id="1261565" wikidata="Q1752993" url="?curid=1261565" title="Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)">
<text>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), also known simply as Scary Monsters, is the fourteenth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 12 September 1980 through RCA Records. His first album following the Berlin Trilogy (&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; and &quot;Lodger&quot;), &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was Bowie&#x27;s attempt at creating a more commercial record after the trilogy proved successful artistically but less so commercially.

Co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was recorded between February and April 1980 at the Power Station in New York City, and later Good Earth Studios in London. Much of the same personnel from prior releases returned for the sessions, with additional guitar by Chuck Hammer and Robert Fripp, and a guest appearance by Pete Townshend. The music incorporates elements of art rock, new wave and post-punk. Unlike the improvisational nature of prior releases, Bowie spent time writing the music and lyrics; several were recorded under working titles and some contained reworked elements of earlier, unreleased songs. The album cover is a large-scale collage featuring Bowie donning a Pierrot costume, with references to his prior releases on the rear sleeve.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, revisited the character of Major Tom from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and was promoted with an inventive music video. &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; garnered critical and commercial acclaim: it topped the UK Albums Chart and restored Bowie&#x27;s commercial standing in the US, reaching No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; would later be referred to by commentators as Bowie&#x27;s &quot;last great album&quot; and a benchmark for subsequent releases. It was Bowie&#x27;s final studio album for RCA and the final collaboration between him and Visconti for over 20 years. Several publications have considered it one of the greatest albums of all time. The album has been reissued multiple times, and was remastered in 2017 as part of the &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot; box set.

== Background ==
From 1976 to 1979, David Bowie recorded what became known as the Berlin Trilogy, which consisted of &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (both 1977) and &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), made in collaboration with the musician Brian Eno and the producer Tony Visconti. Although considered highly influential, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially. &quot;Lodger&quot;″s commercial performance, in particular, was hindered by artists who were influenced by the earlier Berlin releases, such as Gary Numan. According to the biographer David Buckley, Numan&#x27;s fame indirectly led to Bowie taking a more commercial direction for his next record.

== Recording ==
Recording for the album began at the Power Station in New York City in February 1980. Bowie informed returning producer Tony Visconti that this was going to be a more commercial record than his previous releases. Eno did not return, having ended his collaboration with Bowie after &quot;Lodger&quot;, stating he felt the Berlin Trilogy had &quot;petered out&quot; by that record. It was the fifth and final Bowie album with the core lineup of Dennis Davis (drums), Carlos Alomar (guitar) and George Murray (bass), who had been together since &quot;Station to Station&quot; (1976); only Alomar continued working with Bowie hereafter.
King Crimson&#x27;s guitarist Robert Fripp, who played on &quot;Heroes&quot;, was brought back for the sessions, replacing &quot;Lodger&quot; guitarist Adrian Belew. Bowie hired an additional guitarist, Chuck Hammer, after hearing him play with Lou Reed in London the year before. According to the &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, Hammer added multiple textural layers deploying guitar synth and Fripp brought back the same distinctive sound he lent &quot;Heroes&quot;. The pianist Roy Bittan, a member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, returned from the &quot;Station to Station&quot; sessions.

Initial sessions at the Power Station took place over two and a half weeks, with an additional week used for overdubs. Tracks completed were solely instrumental. One instrumental, titled &quot;Crystal Japan&quot;, was originally intended to be the album&#x27;s closing track, but was dropped in favour of a reprise of &quot;It&#x27;s No Game&quot;; the reprise, titled &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (No. 2)&quot;, was completed in its entirety during the initial sessions. At Alomar&#x27;s suggestion, Bowie recorded a cover of Tom Verlaine&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Bowie felt the track was a standout from Verlaine&#x27;s 1979 eponymous solo album and asked Verlaine to play lead guitar. Verlaine agreed, although Fripp ended up playing lead guitar.
Rather than improvising lyrics and music as he had with prior releases, Bowie took time composing and developing the lyrics and melodies, ensuring the musicians adhered to his thought-out structures before adding their own personal touches. Many of the tracks had working titles early on. Some of the these included &quot;People Are Turning to Gold&quot; (&quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;), &quot;It Happens Everyday&quot; (&quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot;), &quot;Jamaica&quot; (&quot;Fashion&quot;), &quot;Cameras in Brooklyn&quot; (&quot;Up the Hill Backwards&quot;) and &quot;I Am a Laser&quot; (&quot;Scream Like a Baby&quot;), which was originally written and recorded in 1973 by a group of Bowie collaborators known as the Astronettes. The lyrics for the title track, which dated back to a 1975 song called &quot;Running Scared&quot;, were written in response to a promotional campaign for Kellogg&#x27;s Corn flakes cereal, which offered novelty toys of &quot;Scary Monsters and Super Heroes&quot;. Other tracks were recorded and left unfinished, including &quot;Is There Life After Marriage?&quot; and an instrumental cover of Cream&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Free&quot;; the latter was fully covered for &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; (1993).

The sessions resumed in April 1980 at Good Earth Studios in London, Visconti&#x27;s own studio at the time. Final instrumental overdubs were provided by Fripp and the keyboardist Andy Clark, along with a guest appearance by the Who guitarist Pete Townshend on &quot;Because You&#x27;re Young&quot;. Vocal tracks were recorded last, including the Japanese narration provided by the actress Michi Hirota for &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (No. 1)&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==

Commentators have classified &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as art rock, new wave, and post-punk. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; to be a culmination of Bowie&#x27;s 1970s works and the record&#x27;s sound to be not &quot;far removed from the post-punk of the early &#x27;80s&quot;. Nicholas Pegg agrees, describing the record as &quot;the triumphant culmination of Bowie&#x27;s steely art-rock phase and a crucial doorway into early 1980s British pop&quot;. In a career retrospective, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; described &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as &quot;a high watermark of art pop by which Bowie&#x27;s future releases are still compared.&quot; Carr and Murray describe the album&#x27;s sound as being harsher – and his worldview more desperate – than anything he had released since &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974). The biographer Christopher Sandford writes that lyrically, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; reaffirms themes that Bowie had explored throughout his career up to that point, including madness, alienation and the &quot;redeeming power of love&quot;; in this case however, Bowie is able to bring the listener in instead of &quot;freezing [them] out&quot;.

=== Side one ===
The album opens with &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (No. 1)&quot;, which features sinister guitar loops and Bowie&#x27;s screaming vocal performance, which Chris O&#x27;Leary cites as reminiscent of John Lennon&#x27;s performance on &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970). Partly taken from an older tune titled &quot;Tired of My Life&quot;, it features lyrics read by the Japanese actress Michi Hirota, which were translated by Hisahi Miura. Hirota delivers her performance in what is described by Buckley as a &quot;macho, samurai voice&quot;, which was done at Bowie&#x27;s insistence as a way to &quot;break down a particular type of sexist attitude about women&quot;. James E. Perone writes that the track establishes the album&#x27;s theme of &quot;scary events&quot;. 

The lyrics of &quot;Up the Hill Backwards&quot; deal with the struggle of facing a crisis. Bowie misquotes Thomas Anthony Harris&#x27;s 1967 self-help book &quot;I&#x27;m OK – You&#x27;re OK&quot;, a guide on how to save marriage relationships; Carr and Murray see this as a reference to Bowie&#x27;s divorce from Angie Bowie. Musically, it features unusual time signatures and a Bo Diddley-inspired beat. For the title track, the rhythm section took inspiration from Joy Division; Davis&#x27;s drum performance has been compared to Stephen Morris&#x27;s on &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot; (1979). Described by Perone as punk rock, the music is heavily distorted, featuring Fripp&#x27;s ferocious guitar-playing, Davis&#x27;s pounding drums, and David Bowie&#x27;s treated Cockney accent. Lyrically, it follows a claustrophobic relationship between a woman (dating back to Bowie&#x27;s Berlin days) and a man (the demons inside Bowie).
&quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; revisits the character of Major Tom from &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (1969). Over ten years later, Major Tom is described as a &quot;junkie&quot;, which has been interpreted as parallel to Bowie&#x27;s own struggles with drug addiction throughout the 1970s. Musically, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; is built around a guitar synthesiser theme by Hammer, augmented by Clark&#x27;s synthesiser. Like &quot;Space Oddity&quot; before it, the song was built in stages, and features layers of instruments in its mix.

&quot;Fashion&quot; is reminiscent of Bowie&#x27;s former single &quot;Golden Years&quot;, with its mix of funk and reggae. It evolved out of a reggae &quot;spoof&quot; started by Clark on his synthesiser and features guitar &quot;squeals&quot; from Fripp. Apart from being a dance track, the song provokes elements of fascism, with lyrics such as &quot;we are the goon squad&quot; and &quot;turn to the left, turn to the right&quot;. The &quot;beep beep&quot; lines were taken from an earlier unreleased song titled &quot;Rupert the Riley&quot;.

=== Side two ===

&quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot;, the longest track on the album, is structurally similar to &quot;Heroes&quot; but does not feature a refrain; its verses only end with the title being sung over Fripp&#x27;s guitar breaks. Its backing vocals are reminiscent of the Ronettes, while piano is provided by Roy Bittan. The song&#x27;s lyrics have been widely interpreted. One interpretation is they are an attack on Bowie imitators who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Gary Numan, who personally believed himself a target. Carr and Murray state that the song is Bowie reflecting on his younger self, while Pegg considers it a confrontation to critics who tried to prevent Bowie from evolving throughout the 1970s. Bowie himself wrote in 2008 that the lyrics are about &quot;taking a short view of life, not looking too far ahead and not predicting the oncoming hard knocks&quot;. Although it descends from the early-mid 1970s &quot;I Am a Laser&quot;, &quot;Scream Like a Baby&quot; features a contemporary new wave sound with lyrics of instability and political imprisonment, comparable with themes present on &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970). Bowie recorded his vocal using varispeed, a technique that displays a &quot;split personality&quot; effect.

&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Bowie&#x27;s first cover on a studio album since &quot;Station to Station&quot;, is in the same key as Verlaine&#x27;s original, but is more grand in style. Doggett describes the arrangement as &quot;an unhappy cross between Motown sound and the sterility of American AOR&quot;. Lyrically, the song features similar themes to other album tracks, including frustration, boredom and repetition. On release, Bowie dedicated &quot;Because You&#x27;re Young&quot; to his then nine-year-old son Duncan Jones. Lyrically, the song is similar to other &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; tracks, featuring Bowie reflecting and advising a younger generation. Townshend&#x27;s contributions are placed low in the mix. The album ends with &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (No. 2)&quot;, which provides a stark contrast to &quot;No. 1&quot;; it features new lyrics and is more mellow and meditative throughout. Doggett writes that whereas &quot;No. 1&quot; &quot;climaxed with the signals of insanity&quot;, &quot;No. 2&quot; &quot;just end[s], draining color from everything around it&quot;. Similar to how the album begins, it ends with the sound of a tape rewinding and playing out, although this time, it slows to a halt.

== Artwork and packaging ==

The cover artwork of &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; is a large-scale collage by the artist Edward Bell featuring Bowie in the Pierrot costume worn in the &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; music video, along with photographs taken by the photographer Brian Duffy. Duffy was reportedly upset by the final artwork, as he felt the cartoon demeaned his photographs. The Pierrot costume, designed by Natasha Korniloff, was indebted to Bowie&#x27;s time performing as a mime with the dancer Lindsay Kemp in the 1968 play &quot;Pierrot in Turquoise&quot;.

The original LP&#x27;s rear sleeve referred to four earlier albums, namely the immediately preceding Berlin Trilogy and 1973&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, the latter also having been designed and photographed by Duffy. The cover images from &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Lodger&quot;—the last showing Bowie&#x27;s torso superimposed on the figure from &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;″s inside gatefold picture—were portrayed in small whitewashed frames to the left of the tracklisting. The lettering used was a reworking of Gerald Scarfe&#x27;s lettering for Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, which would be replicated on many album covers in the ensuing years. These images were not reproduced on the Rykodisc reissue in 1992, but were restored for EMI/Virgin&#x27;s 1999 remastered edition. The original framed album artwork was featured in the &quot;David Bowie Is&quot; touring museum exhibit.

== Release ==
The lead single, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, was released in edited form by RCA Records on 1 August 1980, with the &quot;Lodger&quot; track &quot;Move On&quot; as the B-side. It was issued in three different sleeves, the first 100,000 copies including one of four sets of stamps, all featuring Bowie in the Pierrot outfit he wore in the music video for the song. The song was promoted with a music video which, at a budget of £250,000 (), was the most expensive music video made up to that point. Directed by David Mallet, who directed all of &quot;Lodger&quot;″s music videos, the video depicts Bowie in a Pierrot costume designed by his former collaborator Natasha Korniloff. The single and video are both regarded by biographers as one of Bowie&#x27;s finest, with Pegg stating that it kickstarted the New Romantic movement. The single debuted at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart; after premiering the music video on the BBC television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the single shot to No. 1, becoming Bowie&#x27;s fastest-selling single and dethroning ABBA&#x27;s &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;. It was Bowie&#x27;s second No. 1 single in the UK, after a reissue of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. However, the US release, featuring &quot;It&#x27;s No Game (No. 1)&quot; as the B-side, fared worse, peaking at No. 79 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 chart and No. 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart.

&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was released on 12 September 1980. RCA promoted the album with the tagline &quot;Often Copied, Never Equalled&quot;, seen as a direct reference to the new wave acts Bowie had inspired over the years. The album was a major commercial success, peaking at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, his first since &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974), and remained on the chart for 32 weeks, his longest since &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; (1973). The album restored Bowie&#x27;s commercial standing in the US, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and remained on the chart for 27 weeks. Buckley writes that with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Bowie achieved &quot;the perfect balance&quot; of creativity and mainstream success.

The second single, &quot;Fashion&quot;, was released in edited form on 24 October 1980, with &quot;Scream Like a Baby&quot; as the B-side. The single was another commercial success, peaking at No. 5 in the UK and No. 70 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Like the first single, it was promoted by a music video again directed by Mallet. The video depicts Bowie and his backing musicians as &quot;gum-chewing tough guys&quot;, interspersed with shots of dancers rehearsing and New Romantic followers. Like &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, the video was highly praised, with &quot;Record Mirror&quot; voting both as the best music videos of 1980. The title track was released as the third single, again in edited form, on 2 January 1981, backed by &quot;Because You&#x27;re Young&quot;. The single continued Bowie&#x27;s commercial success in the UK, peaking at No. 20. The fourth and final single, &quot;Up the Hill Backwards&quot;, was released in March 1981, with the non-album Japanese single &quot;Crystal Japan&quot; as the B-side. It peaked at No. 32 in the UK, performing the worst out of all the singles.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; received universal praise from music critics. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; awarded it a rating of seven stars out of five; the same publication voted Bowie the best male singer of 1980, as did the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it a 9 out of 10 rating, describing it as &quot;possibly his most consistently effective long player of all&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it &quot;an eerily impressive stride into the &#x27;80s&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot; correctly predicted that it &quot;should be the most accessible and commercially successful Bowie LP in years&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Robin Denselow agreed, describing &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as being &quot;full of accessible, highly original melodies that are increasingly inaccessible&quot;.

Debra Rae Cohen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the record to be a &quot;clarification&quot; of Bowie&#x27;s collaborations with Eno and similar in vein to &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot;, further finding Bowie &quot;settling old scores&quot; throughout &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. Fellow critic Dave Marsh considered it one of Bowie&#x27;s best, saying &quot;if this is the new art-rock, I&#x27;m for it.&quot; The New York &quot;Daily News&quot;″s Clint Roswell likewise hailed the record as Bowie&#x27;s best in years, naming &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, &quot;Fashion&quot;, &quot;Because You&#x27;re Young&quot; and the title track as songs that recognise the artist as &quot;the preeminent figure in pop&quot;. Adding further praise was James Johnson of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, who described the &quot;remarkable&quot; LP as one of the year&#x27;s best and &quot;proves that Bowie can still maintain his mastery of the rock mainstream whenever he feels like it&quot;.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Jim Sullivan found side two weaker than the first, but concluded &quot;Bowie continues to present a complex, invigorating challenge&quot;. Tom Sowa was more mild in &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;. He hailed &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s finest in four years, highlighting Fripp&#x27;s contributions and signalled out &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and &quot;Because You&#x27;re Young&quot;, but panned &quot;Teenage Wildlife&quot; as &quot;an overheated, confused and totally embarrassing four minutes of plastic&quot;. Murray gave the album a more mixed assessment in &quot;NME&quot;, stating: &quot;&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; is shorn of all hope, yet it represents a call to arms. It is an album which presupposes defeat, yet it is unashamedly and unequivocally confrontational.&quot; He further called it the &quot;realist&#x27;s&quot; Bowie record. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Rockwell felt the album lacked appeal for all rock listeners due to it being &quot;too misshapenly ugly. grindingly abrasive and proudly self-withholding. Nevertheless, he deemed it a &quot;fine record of its particular type&quot;. 

On its end-of-the-year list, &quot;Record Mirror&quot; named &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; the second best album of the year, behind &quot;Sound Affects&quot; by the Jam, while &quot;NME&quot; ranked it the ninth best album of the year. On &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop music critics&#x27; poll, it placed 19th.

== Subsequent events ==
Bowie decided not to support &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; on a concert tour. Instead, he continued his acting career by performing the lead role of Joseph &quot;John&quot; Merrick in the Broadway play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, which ran from July 1980 to January 1981, and guest starring as himself in the film &quot;Christiane F.&quot; (1981). Following John Lennon&#x27;s murder in December 1980, Bowie withdrew to his home in Switzerland and became a recluse. Nevertheless, he continued working, recording the title song of the film &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982) with Giorgio Moroder and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; with the rock band Queen in July 1981. The following month, Bowie performed the title role in a BBC adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Baal&quot; and recorded an accompanying soundtrack EP, both released in early 1982. He also starred in the films &quot;The Hunger&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;, both released in 1983.

Bowie did not release another studio album until &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, released in April 1983. &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was also Bowie&#x27;s final studio album for RCA Records, who had been his label since &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971). Bowie had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the label, who he felt was &quot;milking&quot; his back catalogue. Although RCA was willing to re-sign, Bowie signed a new contract with EMI America Records, and with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, began an era of major commercial success.

== Influence and legacy ==

Retrospectively, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; continues to receive acclaim. Jon Dolan of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that although the 1980s were a less-than-stellar decade for the artist creatively, he began the decade strong with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, praising Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance and describing &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; in particular as &quot;gorgeous&quot;. Erlewine praised the album for its culmination of Bowie&#x27;s 1970s works: &quot;While the music isn&#x27;t far removed from the post-punk of the early &#x27;80s, it does sound fresh, hip, and contemporary, which is something Bowie lost over the course of the &#x27;80s.&quot; Eduardo Rivadavia praised the record&#x27;s &quot;risk-taking creativity&quot; in &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, writing that the artist&#x27;s decision to take time writing lyrics resulted in some of the best lyrics and vocal performances of his career. He ultimately called the album one of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;very best career efforts.&quot; The author Peter Doggett describes &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as one of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most valuable statements&quot;, writing that it &quot;annull[ed] audience expectations&quot; and launched a &quot;warning for those who might dare to follow in his footsteps.&quot;

Reviewing the album&#x27;s remaster for the 2017 box set &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot;, Chris Gerard of &quot;PopMatters&quot; highlighted Bowie&#x27;s vocal performance on the record as among his best, further complimenting the songs&#x27; arrangements and harmonies as &quot;jaw-droppingly brilliant as anything you&#x27;ll find in the realm of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; Analysing the album for its 40th anniversary in 2020, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Ryan Leas described &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; as &quot;the less-heralded classic of Bowie&#x27;s career&quot;, complimenting the way Bowie was able to mesh the different eras of his career up to that point into a creative whole. Leas concluded: &quot;[&quot;Scary Monsters&quot;] was the album that best-captured everything Bowie was about — and it will always be the conduit through which everything travelled, all of his old selves folded in and carried forward through the rest of his life. In a 2013 readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; was voted Bowie&#x27;s seventh greatest album. The magazine argued that it would be his final &quot;satisfying from start to finish&quot; album.
Reflecting on the critical and commercial success of &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Visconti stated, &quot;We kind of felt that we&#x27;d finally achieved our &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, a goal we had in mind since &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;.&quot; Visconti further said: &quot;It is one of my favourite Bowie albums ever.&quot; Despite his glowing assessment of the album, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; proved to be the final collaboration between Bowie and Visconti for over 20 years, after Bowie chose Nile Rodgers to produce &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. Although Bowie would achieve worldwide mega-stardom and commercial success in the following years, in particular with &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;, many commentators consider &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; to be &quot;his last great album&quot; and the &quot;benchmark&quot; for each new release. Well-regarded later efforts such as &quot;Outside&quot; (1995), &quot;Earthling&quot; (1997), &quot;Heathen&quot; (2002) and &quot;Reality&quot; (2003) were cited as &quot;the best album since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;.&quot; Buckley suggested that &quot;Bowie should pre-emptively sticker up his next album &#x27;Best Since &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;″ and have done with it&quot;. The biographer Marc Spitz considers it more accurate to call the album Bowie&#x27;s &quot;last &#x27;young&#x27; record&quot;, in that it was his final &quot;perfectly confident statement&quot; and the final time that Bowie&#x27;s &quot;search for the &#x27;new&#x27; in our world of sound [felt] pure, as opposed to betraying itself&quot;.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers continue to praise &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;. Pegg writes that retrospectively, &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; sounds &quot;as fresh and dynamic as ever&quot;, and ended &quot;Bowie&#x27;s golden run of cutting-edge albums.&quot; O&#x27;Leary described it in 2019 as Bowie&#x27;s most &quot;modern&quot;-sounding album. Spitz finds the record to have an energy that his later &quot;good&quot; albums don&#x27;t (naming &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Heathen&quot;). Doggett considers it as one of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;most valuable statements&quot;, exceeding his listeners&#x27; expectations while at the same time sending a warning out to anyone who dared to follow in his footsteps. Sandford states that with &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, Bowie &quot;found his voice again&quot; after years of experimentation. Perone praises the album as &quot;a near-perfect balance of [Bowie&#x27;s] pop and experimental sides&quot; and that it remains one of the artist&#x27;s &quot;most important and consistent albums&quot;. In 2011, Paul Trynka wrote: &quot;&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; still sparkles today. Its intense, churning grooves sound remarkably contemporary... but despite the complexity of its arrangements there are many moments of unaffected simplicity.&quot; He considers the album&#x27;s &quot;dense, tough, rock-meets-funk backup&quot; as influential on later bands such as Blur and the Strokes. The American electronic music producer Skrillex named his 2010 EP &quot;Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites&quot; after &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;.

=== Rankings ===
&quot;Scary Monsters&quot; has appeared on several lists of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; ranked &quot;Scary Monsters&quot; at number 30 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 93 on its list of the top 100 albums of the 1980s. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 27 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s, saying &quot;Bowie bridles the experimentation of his Berlin trilogy and channels those synth flourishes and off-kilter guitar licks into one of the decade&#x27;s quirkiest pop albums.&quot; In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 381 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 53 on its revised list of the 200 best albums of the 1980s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 443 on its revision of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

== Reissues ==
The album has been rereleased five times to date on compact disc. It was first released on CD by RCA in the mid-1980s. A second CD release, in 1992 by Rykodisc and EMI, contained four bonus tracks. A 1999 CD release by EMI/Virgin, with no bonus tracks, featured 24-bit digitally-remastered sound. The album was re-released in 2003 by EMI as a Super Audio CD, again with no bonus tracks. In 2017, the album was remastered for the &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot; box set released by Parlophone. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, both as part of this compilation and then separately the following year.

<text>Paul Davis (formerly known as Paul Barton-Davis) is a British-American software developer best known for his work on audio software (JACK) for the Linux operating system, and for his role as one of the first two programmers at Amazon.com.

Davis grew up in the English Midlands and in London. After studying molecular biology and biophysics, he did post-graduate studies in computational biology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot and EMBL in Heidelberg.

He immigrated to the U.S. in 1989. He lived in Seattle for seven years, where he worked for the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington, and several smaller software companies in Seattle. While in Seattle, he helped to get Amazon.com off the ground during the period 1994–1996, making critical contributions to Amazon&#x27;s backend systems alongside Shel Kaphan, before subsequently moving to Philadelphia in 1996. In 2019 he moved with his wife to Galisteo, NM

He went on to fund the development of various audio software for Linux, including Ardour and the JACK Audio Connection Kit. He works full-time on free software.

He is also an ultra-marathon runner and touring cyclist.

<text>Michael Joseph Keneally (born December 20, 1961) is an American session guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and composer.

== Early years and musical influences ==
Keneally started playing music at the age of 7 when he received an electric organ for his birthday. He also received a guitar on his eleventh birthday, and plays bass and drums as well. His early childhood musical influences included the Beatles and theme music from cartoon and television shows such as &quot;The Wallace and Ladmo Show&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

== Career ==

Born on Long Island, New York, he moved to San Diego, California at an early age and has been a fixture on the local music scene there since 1985 when he formed the local cult band Drop Control. Although a well established musician in his own right, Keneally is probably most well known as former Frank Zappa &quot;stunt guitarist&quot; and a Zappa 1988 tour band member on both guitar and keyboards. Keneally&#x27;s appointment to that role was secured by his command of Zappa&#x27;s vast and difficult-to-play repertoire.

Keneally had called Zappa and said that he was &quot;extremely familiar with all of his material and that he would be ready to play any of it for him given a short amount of preparation time&quot;, as he had already &quot;been listening to Zappa&#x27;s music for 16 years&quot;. &quot;On the phone the day before the audition Frank had told me to have &#x27;What&#x27;s New in Baltimore?&#x27; and &#x27;Sinister Footwear&#x27; ready for the next day&#x27;s audition&quot;. On the way to the audition Keneally practiced the aforementioned songs, as well as &quot;Little House I Used to Live in&quot;, and &quot;every single Zappa melody I could think of, kind of as an exercise for my memory&quot; as his brother Marty was driving the car.

Keneally&#x27;s stint in the Zappa touring band was short-lived, with the early cancellation of the 1988 tour and Zappa&#x27;s death in 1993. Keneally moved on from the elder Zappa&#x27;s band to work with the eldest Zappa son, Dweezil, on his solo albums and work released as the band Z.

Keneally has also released 11 albums of solo material since 1992 and has guested or acted as sideman on a wide variety of projects, most notably as part of Steve Vai&#x27;s touring bands. He has played guitar and keyboards with Yo Miles!, Wadada Leo Smith, Norwegian legends Ulver and Henry Kaiser&#x27;s Miles Davis tribute band as well as recording the 1995 album &quot;The Mistakes&quot; with Henry Kaiser, Prairie Prince, and Andy West (formerly of Dixie Dregs). He has also produced albums for several bands, including Chris Opperman&#x27;s debut album, Oppy Music, Vol. I: Purple, Crayon.

In 1998 Vai requested that Keneally arrange and perform an album of Vai&#x27;s music on acoustic piano. Recorded in 1999, the album was finally released in 2004 as &quot;&quot;. According to liner notes, Vai selected the songs, produced the album, and mixed it, releasing it on his own &quot;Light Without Heat&quot; label. As of 2008 Keneally has arranged from multi-tracked guitar parts to single-track piano the 12 songs selected by Steve and begun work on a second volume of Vai &quot;Piano Reductions&quot;.

On May 1, 2007, Keneally&#x27;s Exowax label re-released his debut album &quot;hat.&quot; and &quot;Boil That Dust Speck&quot; as deluxe, remastered double disc versions. A remixed and remastered edition of &quot;Sluggo!&quot; followed in 2013. Exowax has obtained Keneally&#x27;s entire back catalog from Immune Records. Planned releases included &quot;Half Alive in Hollywood&quot;, as well as the Mike Keneally and Beer for Dolphins 1996 VHS release &quot;Soap Scum Remover&quot;, which will be remixed and remastered for a DVD release, and the Mistakes, his 1995 side project with Henry Kaiser on guitar and Synclavier, bassist Andy West and drummer Prairie Prince, along with a live Mistakes recording that has been held on the side until Keneally was able to re-acquire the rights to the original album.

On November 28, 2006, Keneally announced that he had been hired as National Music Director for The Paul Green School of Rock Music.

He has also toured with Dethklok as a guitarist and backing vocalist.

On July 20, 2008, at El Cajon, Calif., Keneally played a concert as part of &quot;the most exciting power trio in years,&quot; Keneally • Minnemann • Beller (KMB), consisting of Mike, drummer Marco Minnemann and long-time collaborating bassist Bryan Beller. The band undertook a full tour in 2009 and became Joe Satriani&#x27;s worldwide touring band in 2013.

In August 2009, Keneally released a video for a new solo track, &quot;Hallmark&quot;, from &quot;Scambot 1&quot;, the first part of a planned three-album series.

In June 2010, Keneally entered Skywalker Sound as part of the studio band for Joe Satriani&#x27;s new solo project, along with regular Satriani drummer Jeff Campitelli and bassist Allen Whitman (of San Francisco&#x27;s surf/psychedelic group the Mermen). This same lineup was scheduled to tour in October and November 2010 in support of the album; however Keneally was replaced by English keyboardist Jem Godfrey for two dates on the UK leg of the tour.

In July 2012, Keneally released &quot;Wing Beat Fantastic: Songs written by Mike Keneally &amp; Andy Partridge&quot;, a collaborative album consisting primarily of songs co-written with XTC&#x27;s Andy Partridge during two writing sessions in 2006 and 2008, and of whose band and work Keneally has been a longtime fan (there is a small section of XTC&#x27;s &quot;Mayor of Simpleton&quot; in the song &quot;Day of the Cow 2&quot; from his 1992 debut solo album &quot;hat.&quot;)

In August 2014, Keneally participated in the G4 Experience—a week-long guitar camp—with fellow guitarists Satriani, Paul Gilbert, and Andy Timmons.

<text>Charles Edward Johnson Jr. (born July 20, 1971) is an American former professional baseball player. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball with the Florida Marlins (1994–1998, 2001–2002), the Los Angeles Dodgers (1998), the Baltimore Orioles (1999–2000), the Chicago White Sox (2000), the Colorado Rockies (2003–2004), and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2005).

The two-time National League All-Star player was considered one of the best defensive catchers of his era, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards between and . He was a member of the world champion Florida Marlins team and is one of only three catchers in Major League history to catch at least 100 games in a single season without committing an error.

==Early life and major League career==
Johnson was born in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he graduated from Fort Pierce Westwood High School in Fort Pierce, Florida. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft. He did not sign, and decided to enroll at the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. He was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the first round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. He played with the A-level Kane County Cougars in 1993 and the AA Portland Sea Dogs.

In 1995, Johnson&#x27;s reputation as a skilled defensive player was solidified when he became the fourth catcher in Major League history to win a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season, joining Johnny Bench, Carlton Fisk and Sandy Alomar Jr. Although his offensive statistics weren&#x27;t impressive, he made up for those shortcomings by helping his team with his superior defensive skills. In 1996, Johnson caught Al Leiter&#x27;s no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies. Johnson set a Major League record in 1997 by playing in 123 games without committing a single error, earning him his first All-Star selection, and helping the Marlins win the 1997 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. Johnson led the Marlins in the Series with 10 hits, batting .357 including one home run. Along with winning his third consecutive Gold Glove Award in 1997, he also caught his second no-hitter when Kevin Brown no-hit the Giants on June 10.

In , the Marlins traded Johnson along with Bobby Bonilla, Jim Eisenreich, Gary Sheffield and Manuel Barriosto to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. After finishing the season with the Dodgers, he played for two years in the American League with the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox. He had his best year offensively in , when he had a .304 batting average along with 31 home runs and 91 RBIs, during a season in which he played 84 games for the Orioles and 44 games for the White Sox.

In 2001 he was traded back to the Marlins, where he hit .285 with 16 home runs by mid-season to earn his second All-Star berth. He would also catch his third no hitter when A. J. Burnett no hit the San Diego Padres on May 12. The only Marlins no-hitters Johnson has not caught for Florida were in 2006, when Aníbal Sánchez threw a no-hitter in Dolphin Stadium against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 2013 when Henderson Álvarez no-hit the Detroit Tigers, and 2017 when Edinson Vólquez no-hit the Diamondbacks.

After the 2002 season, the Marlins traded Johnson to the Colorado Rockies where he played for two seasons.
On April 27, 2004, he, rookie Matt Holliday, and Jeromy Burnitz combined to slug back-to-back-to-back home runs against the Marlins, the sixth such occasion in franchise history. After playing for Colorado, he ended his career with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, playing his final game on June 11, 2005 at the age of 33.

==Career statistics==
In a twelve-season major league career covering 1,188 games, Johnson had a .245 batting average along with 167 home runs, 570 runs batted in and a .993 fielding percentage. His .993 fielding percentage ranks 16th all-time among major league catchers. Along with his four Gold Glove Awards, Johnson twice led National League catchers in fielding percentage, and once each in baserunners caught stealing and assists. During his playing career, he ranked second only to Iván Rodríguez in throwing out baserunners, with a 39% average. He earned two All-Star berths as well as winning a World Series during his career. His three no hitters caught ties him with several other players for third place on the all-time list behind the four no hitters caught by Jason Varitek and Carlos Ruiz. Johnson played more games as a catcher than any other player in Marlins history with 582.

Johnson is a member of the Portland Sea Dogs Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Johnson now lives in Miami with his wife Rhonda. They have two sons. Brandon, who is a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the National Football League (NFL) and former college football wide receiver for the University of Tennessee, and Beau, who plays college football as a tight end for Georgia Southern University. Johnson is a cousin of former Major Leaguer Fred McGriff.

<text>Squat Theatre (1977–1991) was a Hungarian theatre company from Budapest which left Hungary for Paris and then New York City, where they performed experimental theatre. 
==History==
Living in Paris in 1977, a friend of the company, Tamas Szentjoby, suggested that they change the name from Kassák Haz Studió to Squat Theatre. The first play was created for a Western audience: &quot;Pig, Child, Fire!&quot; It was set in a storefront in Rotterdam, a setting that became their trademark. After touring Nancy, France, Shiraz, Baltimore, Paris, the company arrived at the Hotel Chelsea in July, they settled in New York City. Several members left the company in 1985 when they lost the lease to their space on 23rd Street including Anna Koós, Péter Halász, Eric Daille, and Agnes Santha. The rest of the company continued until 1991, Squat Theatre&#x27;s last play was &quot;Full Moon Killer&quot;, 1991, performed at The Kitchen in New York City.

===Founding members===
The six founding members of Squat Theatre (shown left to right in the 1976 Paris photograph) are Peter (Breznyik) Berg, Marianne Kollar (3rd), Péter Halász, Anna Koós, Stephan Balint and Eva Buchmuller. Other members of Squat Theatre were: Eric Daillie, Agnes Santha, Klara Palotai, Eszter Balint, Boris Major, Rebecca Major, and Judith Galus Halasz. Important contributing actors were Sheryl Sutton, Sandi Fiddler, Kathleen Kendall, Nico, Yossi Gutmann (viola), Shirley Clarke, Richard Leacock, August Darnell, Mark Boone Junior, Sue Williams, Jane Smith, Larry Solomon, Ivan Jakovits and Jan Gontarczyk. Boris and Rebecca Major are the daughters of János Major. 

Originally, the company was known as Kassák Haz Studió and was located at Uzsoki-utca 57, Budapest. For political and aesthetic reasons, the company emigrated to Paris and then to the United States. In 1969 Anna Koós, Péter Halász and Stephan Balint from the University Theatre of Budapest created an independent theatre group called Kassák Haz Studió.
In 1972 they were censored by the Hungarian authorities for &quot;political and esthetic radicalism&quot;, and banned from performing in public. In the next four years they wrote 36 performance events: plays, sketches and improvisations. These were shown in apartments, staircases, streets, beaches, and in the countryside. &quot;Manifesto&quot; by István Bálint (Stephan Balint) on behalf of Studio Kassak was published in &quot;Schmuck,&quot; Hungary, March–April, 1973 issue.

==Audiences==
The building at 256 West 23rd Street had a large window on the sidewalk with a street entrance this provided the possibility of having two audiences, one inside and one outside. The spectators sat in the back of the space facing the storefront window and 23rd street beyond. Events took place with the street as a backdrop, with the intention of unsettling the events, the relationship among the members of the theatre group, and the audience. This set-up was first used in Rotterdam at 129a Van Oldenbarneveltstraat in the show &quot;Pig, Child, Fire!&quot;, which was commissioned by the Toneelraad Rotterdam.
On 23rd Street they lived, worked and performed from 1977 to 1985. 

===1973 to 1985===
Various plays were performed in 1973 including &quot;Alice and Her Sisters,&quot; &quot;Tribute to Miron Bialoszewski&quot; performed at the Polish Cultural Center in Budapest. &quot;Birds and Red Epaulets,&quot; Éva Buchmüller sings a Jewish song as the Virgin Mary holding Can Togay on her lap in the position of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pieta&quot;.

The &quot;Three Sisters&quot; by Anton Chekhov was performed for the first time at Dohány utca 20, Budapest. They used as text the abridged version of the original play limited to the lines of the three sisters. The company left Hungary for the West.
&quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Last Love&quot; was collectively created and opened on 23rd Street in 1978. The Company went on tour to Hamburg, Rome. Milan, Florence, Belgrade, Rotterdam and Brussels. It won a Grand Prix at the Belgrade International Theatre Festival (BITEF), and the Italian Critics’ Award for the Best Foreign Performance.

In 1981 &quot;Mr Dead &amp; Mrs Free&quot; premiered in Cologne, Germany. Commissioned by Ivan Nagel director of Theater der Welt and shown at Cologne’s &quot;Theatres of the World&quot; festival, &quot;Mr. Dead &amp; Mrs. Free&quot; was filmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder as part of his first and only documentary &quot;Theater in Trance.&quot; It was also shown in New York City and Amsterdam. The show had a year-and-a-half performance run on 23rd Street. It was awarded an Obie Award (1982) for the &quot;Best New American Play&quot;. It received a The Villager (Manhattan) Award. An open-air version of the show, &quot;The Battle of Sirolo&quot; was performed in August in Polverigi, Italy. In the summer of 1985 the theatre lost the eight-year lease of their home and performance space on 23rd Street.

<doc id="1261589" wikidata="Q429960" url="?curid=1261589" title="Chrysoprase">
<text>Chrysoprase, chrysophrase or chrysoprasus is a gemstone variety of chalcedony (a cryptocrystalline form of silica) that contains small quantities of nickel. Its color is normally apple-green, but varies from turquoise-like cyan to deep green. The darker varieties of chrysoprase are also referred to as prase. (However, the term prase is also used to describe chlorite-included quartz, and to a certain extent is a color-descriptor, rather than a rigorously defined mineral variety.)

Chrysoprase is cryptocrystalline, which means that it is composed of crystals so fine that they cannot be seen as distinct particles under normal magnification. This sets it apart from rock crystal, amethyst, citrine, and the other varieties of crystalline quartz. Other members of the cryptocrystalline silica family include agate, carnelian, and onyx. Unlike many non-transparent silica minerals, it is the color of chrysoprase, rather than any pattern of markings, that makes it desirable. The word chrysoprase comes from the Greek &quot;chrysos&quot; meaning &#x27;gold&#x27; and &quot;prasinon&quot;, meaning &#x27;green&#x27;.

Unlike emerald which owes its green color to the presence of chromium, the color of chrysoprase is due to trace amounts of nickel compounds in the form of very small inclusions. The nickel reportedly occurs as different silicates, like kerolite or pimelite (not NiO mineral, bunsenite, as was reported before). Chrysoprase results from the deep weathering or lateritization of nickeliferous serpentinites or other ultramafic ophiolite rocks. In the Australian deposits, chrysoprase occurs as veins and nodules with brown goethite and other iron oxides in the magnesite-rich saprolite below an iron and silica cap.

As with all forms of chalcedony, chrysoprase has a hardness of 6 to 7 on the Mohs hardness scale and a conchoidal fracture like flint.

== Sources ==
The best known sources of chrysoprase are Indonesia, Queensland, Western Australia, Haneti Tanzania, Germany, Poland, Russia, Arizona, California, and Brazil. Deposits in central Tanzania have been in constant production since 1986. The chrysoprase and nickel silicate ore deposit in Szklary, Lower Silesia, Poland, was probably the biggest European chrysoprase occurrence and possibly also the biggest in the world.

== Fashion ==
Chrysoprase was fashionable during the 1980s.

== Similar minerals ==
A very similar mineral to chrysoprase is chrome chalcedony, in which the color is provided by chromium rather than nickel.

<doc id="1261594" wikidata="Q6700320" url="?curid=1261594" title="Luis Antonio Rivera">
<text>Luis Antonio Rivera (April 9, 1930 – November 30, 2023), also known as &quot;Yoyo Boing&quot;, was a Puerto Rican actor, comedian and television show host, who was also one of the pioneers of Puerto Rican television.

==Early years==
Rivera Benítez was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico on April 9, 1930 to Juan Antonio Rivera and Josefa Benítez Ortíz. His parents moved to Santurce, where he spent his childhood and adolescence, from Humacao when he was only three years old. After receiving his primary education, Rivera attended the &quot;Escuela Superior Central de Santurce&quot; (Central High School of Santurce). He found a part-time job at a local radio station which opened the doors to a new world for him.

Rivera became a member of the Drama Department of the University of Puerto Rico. As a drama student, he participated in two of René Marqués&#x27; plays. Having a deep baritone voice he also became a radio presenter. His radio station dramatized comedy sketches, and one of the producers suggested dramatizing Archie Comics over the radio. Due to the lack of audiovisual references for the characters at the time, there were no clear cut ways of representing the characters in Spanish, nor there were exact translations for their names. Rivera came up with the name of &quot;Yoyo Boing&quot; for representing Jughead; the name &quot;Yoyo&quot; sounded close to &quot;Jughead&quot;, and the &quot;Boing&quot; part was a gimmick Rivera developed for the character: a vocalized &quot;boing&quot; that he constantly repeated to fill in silence gaps during each episode. Ever since his Archie stint on Puerto Rican radio, Puerto Ricans rarely refer to Rivera using his real name, and usually refer to him by his by-now &quot;nickname&quot;.

==Pioneer in Puerto Rican television==
1954 was the year that television was born in Puerto Rico. Rivera, together with Tommy Muñiz, José Miguel Agrelot and Paquito Cordero was one of the first comedians in Puerto Rican television. In 1960, he starred alongside Norma Candal (Petunia) in a television comedy called &quot;La Críada Malcríada&quot; (The Rude Maid). In the 1970s, Rivera starred in own sit-com called &quot;&quot;Mi Hippie Me Encanta&quot; (I&#x27;m Crazy about My Hippie) broadcast by Telemundo. In the 1980s, Rivera starred in the situation comedies, &quot;Generaciones&quot;, (Generations), with Chayanne, &quot;Los Suegros&quot; (The In-Laws) and later in a spin-off of that show called &quot;Los Suegros y Los Nietos&quot;&quot; (The In-Laws and the Grandchildren), broadcast by WAPA-TV. Rivera was also the General Manager of radio stations WKBM-AM (&quot;AM 81&quot;) and WORO-FM (&quot;Radio Oro&quot;, or Golden Radio), the radio branches of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Juan.

Various media producers arranged for many Puerto Rican performers to tour New York City in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Rivera was one of these. As fate would have it, one particularly chilly evening Rivera and Bobby Capó were exiting a performance outside the &quot;Teatro Puerto Rico&quot; and were looking for a place to eat. While waiting for public transportation, Rivera told Bobby Capó two jokes. These two jokes, reinterpreted by Capó and set to music, became two major musical hits: &quot;El Negro Bembón&quot;, for Rafael Cortijo and his Combo (sung by Ismael Rivera), and &quot;El Caballo Pelotero&quot;, a smash hit for El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico (original version sung by Pellín Rodríguez).
For years, Rivera co-hosted &quot;El Show del Mediodía&quot;, a midday variety show, on WAPA-TV alongside Luis Vigoreaux. After Vigoreaux was murdered early in 1983, Rivera became the show&#x27;s main host, position in which he performed for several years afterwards.

==Later years and Death==
In the 1990s, Rivera wrote a book titled &quot;A Reír Con Yoyo&quot; (Let&#x27;s Laugh with Yoyo) and donated all of the proceeds to an AIDS organization. He was also active in a television show called &quot;Desde Mi Pueblo&quot; (&quot;From My Town&quot;) for WIPR-TV (San Juan&#x27;s channel 6), where he would visit every town and city and show all of the interesting aspects of the featured place. His co-hosts on the program were Deborah Carthy-Deu, Maria Falcon and Tony Croatto.

After José Miguel Agrelot&#x27;s sudden death in 2004, the remaining co-hosts on Agrelot&#x27;s long-running radio show &quot;Tu Alegre Despertar&quot;, (Your Cheerful Wake-Up), Aurora Previdi and María Falcón, asked the radio audience to select a permanent replacement for Agrelot from a round of temporary co-hosts. Rivera won the assignment; given the wishes of Agrelot&#x27;s family to achieve some closure, the program changed its name to &quot;Contigo en el tapón&quot; (&quot;Along With You In The Traffic Jam&quot;) and changed its format slightly. Rivera remained as a popular co-host, filling Agrelot&#x27;s considerably large shoes. He also hosted a daily program of Puerto Rican music classics at &quot;Allegro&quot; WIPR-FM.

Puerto Rican writer Giannina Braschi wrote a performance novel using the Yoyo Boing nickname as a title with some punctuation added: &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot;. Featuring a tinted photo of Rivera with superimposed X-ray specs for the book&#x27;s jacket, the comic bilingual novel has very little to do with Rivera himself, but does feature a dream sequence inspired by childhood memories of the roles he played.

By the 2000s, Rivera was retired from television but making special appearances. He was the protagonist of the locally produced movie for television &quot;Santa Clos es Boricua&quot; (Santa Claus is Puerto Rican) which was telecast in Puerto Rico and the United States through Televicentro on December 20, 2004. Since the early 2010s Rivera, who celebrated his 90th birthday on April 9, 2020, was the host and producer of the popular radio talk show Tus Compañeros Del Tapón, a daily afternoon program on 940AM, WIPR (AM).

In 2020, Rivera suffered a stroke. A successful fundraiser was organized by a local journalist to provide Rivera with a power wheelchair lift. He died from heart disease at the Hospital del Maestro in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico on November 30, 2023, at the age of 93.

<text> (, &quot;Obsession&quot;) is a 1943 Italian crime drama film directed and co-written by Luchino Visconti, in his directorial debut. It is an unauthorized and uncredited adaptation of the 1934 novel &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; by American author James M. Cain, and stars Clara Calamai, Massimo Girotti, and Juan de Landa in the leading roles. It is often considered to be the first Italian neorealist film, though there is some debate about whether such a categorization is accurate.

Banned and ostracized by the Fascist regime during its initial release, the Italian Ministry of Culture has since placed on its list of 100 Italian films to be saved, distinguishing films which &quot;changed the collective memory of the country between 1942 and 1978.&quot;

==Plot==
Gino Costa, a wandering tramp, stops at a small roadside tavern and petrol station in the Po Valley, run by Giovanna Bragana and her older husband, Giuseppe. Giovanna is disgusted by her husband, having married him only for his money, and is instantly drawn to the younger and more attractive Gino. Giovanna serves Gino a meal, but they are interrupted by Giuseppe, who throws Gino out. Giovanna claims Gino did not pay, pocketing his money, as an excuse for him to return. Giuseppe chases after Gino, only to find that Gino has no money left, so Gino offers to fix Giuseppe&#x27;s vehicle as payment for the meal, and the two bond over a shared military service as Bersaglieri.

When Giuseppe leaves to pick up a part for the vehicle, Gino and Giovanna confess their feelings to each other and begin an affair. Giuseppe, completely oblivious to the situation, takes a liking to Gino and tells him that he can stay and help out around the tavern. After a few days, Gino tries to convince Giovanna to run away with him. Giovanna initially agrees, but on the way to the train station she changes her mind and refuses to go through with it, so Gino leaves without her.

While Gino is on the train, he is confronted by the ticket inspector and admits that he has neither a ticket nor money. &quot;Lo Spagnolo&quot; (&quot;The Spaniard&quot;), a traveling street entertainer, steps in to pay for his train ticket and the two become friends. When they reach the city of Ancona, Gino spends a night at an inn with Spagnolo, where he reveals that he cannot stop thinking about Giovanna. When Spagnolo learns that Giovanna refuses to leave her husband because she fears having no money and security, he advises Gino to &quot;run far away&quot; and forget about Giovanna. Later that night, Spagnolo lights a cigarette and holds the match up in the dark bedroom to watch Gino while he sleeps.

Gino stays in Ancona and gets a job holding up an advertisement sign for Spagnolo. One day, Giuseppe and Giovanna run into Gino by chance, and the three go to a bar where Giuseppe sings in a voice competition. While he is on stage, Gino confesses to Giovanna that he tried to forget her but could not and tries again to convince her to leave with him. Even though Giovanna still has feelings for Gino, she refuses and tells him that she will stay with her husband, to which he angrily replies, &quot;Then I&#x27;ll come back to the store. Is that what you want?&quot;

After the voice competition, Gino, Giuseppe, and Giovanna leave together to return to the Braganas&#x27; tavern. Giuseppe has been celebrating his successful singing performance and is quite drunk. Gino and Giovanna take advantage of his inebriated state and conspire to murder him. They convince Giuseppe to let Gino drive and stage the murder as a traffic accident. 

In the aftermath of their crime, tensions begin to arise. Gino wants to sell the tavern and leave, while Giovanna wants to stay and run the tavern. Gino feels guilty about the murder, and his guilt is amplified by the fact that he is now living in the home of the man he killed. This causes him to feel trapped and he acts coldly toward Giovanna.

Giovanna hosts a party at the tavern to increase business, and Spagnolo shows up at the party. Gino is initially happy to see his friend, but he becomes agitated when Spagnolo tries to get him to leave and go traveling. Spagnolo implies that he knows of Gino&#x27;s crime, and Gino loses his temper and punches Spagnolo. A bystander, who is actually a detective that has been investigating Gino and Giovanna, helps Spagnolo up. As Spagnolo walks away, Gino calls out to him, but he does not turn around.

In a brief scene, Spagnolo is seen as having arrived to speak to someone who works in an office at the police office.

One day while Gino and Giovanna are in town, Gino flirts with Anita, a young prostitute. Anita leaves, and Giovanna returns to Gino to tell him that Giuseppe had life insurance. This makes Gino feel that Giovanna has used him, and he feels even more guilt-ridden over the murder. He angrily yells at Giovanna that he does not want to be with her anymore and goes off to find Anita. Gino and Anita spend some time together in Anita&#x27;s apartment before deciding to leave together to get some food. While they are outside, Giovanna, who has been sitting at a café outside Anita&#x27;s apartment building, angrily confronts Gino. Anita runs off, and Giovanna threatens to tell the police that Gino killed Giuseppe if Gino does not stay with her. Gino loses his temper and hits Giovanna, causing a scene. He then goes back to Anita&#x27;s apartment and confesses the crime to her.

Meanwhile, two men who arrived on the scene shortly after Giuseppe&#x27;s death have contacted the police, and their description of events does not quite match that given by Gino and Giovanna. The detective who has been investigating the case is sent to bring Gino and Giovanna in for further questioning, but when Gino sees the detective outside Anita&#x27;s apartment he is afraid Giovanna has gone to the police, so he convinces Anita to distract the detective and escapes by climbing across the roof to a neighboring building.

Gino returns to Giovanna at the tavern, where she tells him that she did not go to the police before saying she is pregnant with his child and still loves him. Shocked, Gino leaves and spends the night wandering alone. Giovanna searches for him and finds him the next day on the beach, by which point he seems to have come to terms with their crime and has new resolve to love Giovanna and try to build a life with her. After they make up and spend some romantic time together on the beach, Gino tells Giovanna about the detective and she finally agrees that they need to leave the tavern. They get in their car and depart, but, realizing the police are on their trail, they drive as fast as they can and end up tailgating a large truck. In a twist of fate, the truck knocks their car over the edge of the road and into a river, killing Giovanna. Devastated, Gino carries her body out of the wreckage and surrenders to the police.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Background ===
Working under the censorship of the Fascist Italian government, Visconti encountered problems with the production even before filming commenced. He had initially wanted to adapt a story by Giovanni Verga, the Italian realist writer and one of his greatest influences, but that project was turned down almost immediately by the Fascist authorities due to its subject matter, which revolved around bandits. Around this time, Visconti uncovered a French translation of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; that had been given to him by French director Jean Renoir while he was working in France in the 1930s.

=== Development and writing ===
Visconti adapted the novel with a group of men he selected from the Milanese magazine &quot;Cinema,&quot; which was edited by Vittorio Mussolini, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son. The members of this group were talented filmmakers and writers and played a large role in the emerging neorealist movement: Mario Alicata, Gianni Puccini, Antonio Pietrangeli, and Giuseppe De Santis. Many of the &quot;Cinema&quot; crew were open or covert antifascists, a fact both the older and younger Mussolini tolerated under the belief their presence was necessary for the Italian film industry to innovate and compete with its rivals elsewhere, so long as their politics did not overtly affect the content of their films. Several of the &quot;Cinema&quot; alumni, including Visconti, would later go underground and join the resistance.

=== Filming ===
 was filmed between the summer and autumn of 1942. The exteriors were shot on-location in and around the Po Valley and the &quot;commune&quot; of Ferrara. Filming locations included the settlements of Codigoro, Ancona, Comacchio and Boretto. The interiors were shot at S.A.F.A. Studios in Rome.

==Analysis==

For the most part, Visconti retained the plot of the novel. He made changes such as tailoring the script to its Italian setting and adding a character (Lo Spagnolo), but the main departure from the novel and the defining characteristic of the film is the manner in which it confronts the realities of life.

Despite arguments about how to define neorealist cinema, certainly one of &#x27;s most poignant aspects is its stark realism and, despite being popular actors of Italian cinema, the stars of the film, Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai, deliver breathtaking performances that are anything but glamorous. In one particularly memorable scene that anticipates a major theme of neorealism, Giovanna, &#x27;s central female character, enters her wildly messy kitchen, serves herself a bowl of soup and sits down with a newspaper, only to fall asleep, slumped over wearily in the midst of the confusion. At several moments like this one, Visconti slows the pace to give the viewer an even more penetrating glimpse into the routine of his characters and, in doing so, roots the narrative squarely in the life of his characters.

In another scene, Gino, Giovanna, and Giuseppe are eating when Giuseppe comments that a local landowner has been shot from behind by a worker, believed to be the result of the worker&#x27;s love for the landowner&#x27;s wife. In this way, Visconti foreshadows the man&#x27;s own death and illuminates the study of class tension that is woven fluidly into the film. Soon afterwards, Giuseppe submits to his wife&#x27;s physical and verbal responses to cats crying outside and fetches his shotgun and leaves. Shortly after his exit, the adulterous lovers huddle close and hear gunshots, thereby hinting at the doom also reserved for the lovers &quot;in heat&quot;.

The landscape itself is realistic, and Visconti takes great care to situate his characters in a rural Italy that remains for the most part unromanticized. Nearly the entire story is told using medium and long shots, with Visconti choosing to employ close-ups only at moments of intense emotion. Characters are depicted interacting with and moving around within their environment; to help create this effect, Visconti favors long and ponderous shots, while making use of depth of focus to highlight the variety of action occurring throughout the space of the frame. He resists identifying solely with one character and prefers instead to maintain a distance, taking them all in with his viewfinder as independent, but irrevocably tangled, components of a larger cast, which includes the sets, scenery, and landscape, as well as what goes on outside of the frame. Shots of the landscape largely consist of the dusty road winding into the distance and the interior shots are just as bleak; the dowdy kitchen exudes a nearly tangible film of dust and grime and the dingy hotel room that speaks, with each detail, of the rebellious freedom cherished by those who share it.

The shift of focus from the novel is clear even in Visconti&#x27;s decision to change the title: whereas the novel&#x27;s title alludes to the final retribution exacted upon the adulterous couple, Visconti&#x27;s header bespeaks the focus of his film, obsessive passion. The lovers, Gino and Giovanna, played by Girotti and Calamai, first meet in the kitchen of the inn that Giovanna runs with her husband, the fat and dim-witted Giuseppe. It is in the symbolic and literal center of the family sphere, before they ever touch, that the two make a silent oath. Their love, tainted as it is by a lie, is difficult for either of them to bear, and the tension is only exacerbated by Giuseppe&#x27;s overwhelming presence. Unable to continue the affair under such pretense, but genuinely in love, Gino tries to persuade Giovanna to leave with him. She is clearly tempted, but knows of the power the road has over Gino, a relationship that Visconti executes nearly as palpably as that between him and Giovanna. She ultimately refuses Gino, opting for the security and stability that Giuseppe has to offer, and Gino sets out once again unencumbered. When they cross paths some time later, it is in the city, and Giuseppe is extremely drunk, engaged in a singing competition. Against the backdrop of the drunken and foolish Giuseppe, the couple plans his death, an act they carry out in a car crash. Rather than granting them the freedom they so desperately seek, however, the murder only heightens the need for deception and makes more acute the guilt they had previously been dealing with. Despite Giovanna&#x27;s attempt to construct a normal life with Gino, Giuseppe&#x27;s presence seems to remain long after they return to the inn. Their already crumbling relationship reaches its bounds when they go to collect the money from Giuseppe&#x27;s life insurance policy. They have a very hostile argument and Gino retaliates by engaging Anita, an attractive young prostitute. Though Giovanna is pregnant and there seems to be some hope for the couple, Gino is left alone to deal with the law when Giovanna is killed in the film&#x27;s second car crash.

The character of Lo Spagnolo (The Spaniard), Visconti&#x27;s main textual departure from the novel, plays a pivotal role in the story of . After failing to convince Giovanna to flee with him, Gino meets Spagnolo after boarding a train to the city, and the two of them strike up an instant friendship, subsequently working and living together. Spagnolo is an actor who works as a street vendor and serves as a foil to Giovanna&#x27;s traditionalism and inability to let go of the material lifestyle. In contrast to the other main characters, who come across as very real and thoroughly developed, Spagnolo operates chiefly on a symbolic level. He represents for Gino the possibility of a liberated masculinity living a successful life separate from society&#x27;s impositions—an alternative to the life he is drawn toward in his relationship with Giovanna.

Both Giovanna and Gino are tragic characters in their inability to find a space in which to situate themselves comfortably. The limited roles made available by society prove to be insufficient in providing narratives for their lives that bring them closer to happiness. Giovanna is pulled away from the security of her marriage to the repulsive Giuseppe by a desire for true love and fulfillment, whose potential is actualized with the appearance of Gino. Her attempts to hold onto the fortune that came with marriage, however, ultimately lead to the failure of her relationship with Gino and perhaps, by extension, to her death. Gino&#x27;s situation seems to be just as distinct, if not more so, as the force pulling him away from Giovanna is his fear of a traditional commitment. From the first time that they sleep together, after which Giovanna shares with Gino all of her deepest problems while he listens to the sound of waves in a seashell, it is clear that he answers only to the open road, identifying it as his alternative to becoming an active part of mainstream society. Spagnolo is the road manifest, masculine freedom in opposition to Giovanna&#x27;s femininity, love, and family values. Caught in between the two conflicting ideals, Gino ends up violating both of them and dooming himself in the process.

Visconti&#x27;s approach to filmmaking is very structured, and there are several parallel scenes in the film, such as the car crashes. Additionally, Gino angrily leaves Giovanna by the side of the road and is later abandoned by Spagnolo in a similar way, and Gino and Spagnolo sit side by side on a wall shortly after they meet, a scene that is repeated at the end of their friendship. Cinematic techniques, such as the instances in which Visconti foreshadows major plot twists or the introduction of Spagnolo as a counterweight, demonstrate Visconti&#x27;s formalist streak and technical virtuosity, but his realist vision and taste for drama are truly what breathe life into .

== Release and reception ==

=== Fascist reaction and ban ===
When was completed and released in 1943, it was far from the innocent murder mystery the authorities had expected; after a few screenings in Rome and northern Italy, which prompted outraged reactions from Fascist and Church authorities, the film was banned by the Fascist government that had been reestablished in the German-occupied part of Italy after the September 1943 armistice. Eventually, the Fascists destroyed the film, but Visconti managed to keep a duplicate negative from which all existing prints have been made.

=== Post-war ===
After the war, encountered more problems with mass distribution, both because Visconti had never obtained the rights to adapt Cain&#x27;s novel as a result of the wartime production schedule and because Metro-Goldwyn Mayer produced an adaptation directed by Tay Garnett while the Fascist ban on Visconti&#x27;s work was still in effect. Due to the copyright issues, the film was not released in the United States until 1976, but, despite the limited number of screenings, it was still able to gain acclaim among moviegoers who recognized in it some of the same sensibilities they had grown familiar with in neorealist films by Michaelangelo Antonioni, Puccini, and De Santis, among others.

<doc id="1261600" wikidata="Q1069752" url="?curid=1261600" title="Gunstar Heroes">
<text>Gunstar Heroes is a run and gun video game developed by Treasure and published by Sega. It was Treasure&#x27;s debut game, originally released for the Sega Genesis in 1993. The game&#x27;s premise is centered around a pair of characters, the Gunstars, in their efforts to stop an evil empire from recovering four powerful gems. The characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage. There are four weapons in the game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types.

Development on &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; began among a team of staff working at Konami in 1991. Following an unwillingness of Konami to embrace their original game ideas, the team quit in 1992 and formed Treasure to see their project through. The team wanted to develop their game for the Genesis because of the system&#x27;s powerful Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Sega initially rejected their proposal, but later granted approval after they had been working for Sega for several months on &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; (1993). Treasure worked on both games in parallel, and released &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; worldwide as their first game in 1993.

&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; was a critical success, being praised for its frantic action and advanced graphics. It helped establish Treasure&#x27;s place in the industry, and introduced several design conventions which would become characteristic of their later work such as large bosses and a unique sense of humor. It was re-released several times, including dedicated ports to the Game Gear and Nintendo 3DS, and received a sequel on the Game Boy Advance. In retrospect, it is considered one of the best action games of the 16-bit era, and one of the best video games of all time by several publications.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; is a run and gun game played from a side-scrolling perspective similar to &quot;Contra&quot;. The game can be played in single-player, or cooperatively with a partner. The players take on the role of Gunstar Red and Gunstar Blue as they battle with an evil empire for control over a set of powerful gems. The game features seven stages, of which the first four can be tackled in any order. The stage formats vary; while some feature a typical left-to-right format, others have the player riding in a mine cart along walls, fighting enemies on a helicopter, or playing a board game. Completing a level grants the player an extension to their maximum health.

When starting a game, the player can choose either a free or fixed firing stance; the fixed stance immobilizes the character when shooting, while the free stance has the player move in the direction they are firing. The player also has a choice of starting weapon. There are four shot types in the game: a homing shot, lightning blaster, flamethrower, and machine gun. Each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses, and can be swapped with others from item drops in each stage. The weapons can be combined with each other to produce unique shot types. For example, the homing shot can be combined with the machine gun to add a homing effect to the latter, or two lightning shots can be combined to create a more powerful lightning gun. In addition to firing their weapon, the player characters can pull off a series of acrobatic maneuvers including jumping, sliding, and grabbing and throwing enemies.

== Development ==
In 1991, several Konami employees led by programmer Masato Maegawa began holding planning sessions at coffee shops for an original game. They were establishing early concepts for an action shooting game, a genre they were familiar with. They pitched their idea to Konami, but were told it would not sell and it was rejected. Maegawa and his team were growing frustrated with the industry&#x27;s reliance on sequels to established franchises and console conversions of arcade games to generate revenue. They felt Konami had fallen into this pattern as a large company, growing reliant on sequels in their &quot;Castlevania&quot; and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series. Maegawa and his team felt consumers wanted original games, and so in 1992, they left Konami and established Treasure to continue development on their original game.
Treasure wanted to develop their game for Sega&#x27;s Genesis. Maegawa was interested in the platform because of its Motorola 68000 microprocessor, which he felt was easier to program for than the Super NES, and more powerful. The team decided to approach Sega for a publishing contract. When they first presented their design documents to Sega, they were not granted approval because they lacked a proven track record. Instead, Sega contracted Treasure to develop &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; (1993). Several months into development, they were finally granted approval to work on their original action game. They originally were using the working title &quot;Lunatic Gunstar,&quot; thinking &quot;Lunatic&quot; was a good description of the game&#x27;s stimulating action. Sega of America felt the word held a negative connotation, so rejected it. The team also considered &quot;Blade Gunner&quot;, in homage to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, but this was also rejected because of copyright restrictions. Sega of America eventually suggested the word &quot;Heroes,&quot; so &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; became the final title.

Treasure consisted of around 18 people, most being programmers from Konami. The staff was split in half to work on both &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; and &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; in parallel. The core team behind &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; consisted of six people: two programmers, two graphic designers, and two sound programmers. The staff (known by their nicknames) was composed of main programmer Yaiman, enemy and boss programmer Nami, graphic designers Han and Iuchi, composer Non, and sound effects programmer Murata. The role of game designer did not exist within Treasure; all game design and planning was undertaken by everyone involved. The team felt they had more freedom working under Sega than Konami. Maegawa got approval to add a Treasure logo when the game booted, which he felt was a rare opportunity for developers to get in that era.
Development of &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; lasted around nine to ten months. It was the team&#x27;s first experience programming for the Genesis, having come off programming for the Super NES at Konami. Programmers Mitsuru Yaida and Hideyuki Suganami previously programmed &quot;Contra III: The Alien Wars&quot; (1992) for the Super NES at Konami. The team felt the Genesis&#x27;s processor was more powerful, capable, and friendly to experimentation than other consoles. This led them to consider it more suited for action games and the sophisticated graphical effects they were looking to create. The team implemented heavy visual effects in an exercise in design experimentation (not an effort to push the hardware). Some of that experimenting was done with the system&#x27;s sprite rotation and scaling capabilities, which evoked a sense of depth. The Genesis had its limitations however, as it could only display 64 colors on screen at once. The team placed extra effort on coloring to compensate. Early backgrounds were drawn with a 16 color palette, but they looked desolate, so ultimately two palettes with 32 colors were used. The team also used programming tricks to make the scenery appear like three to four layers were present, although the Genesis only supports two.

The team approached &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; with an &quot;anything goes&quot; concept, that led to many ambitious ideas being implemented into the final game. One such concept was the weapon combination mechanic, which was conceived in the early planning stages. They experimented with weapon attributes until the end of development, and designed the game so players would continue discovering new weapons and devise new ways to complete stages. The processor also made articulated multi-limb enemies possible, like the boss &quot;Seven Force,&quot; which was programmed by Nami along with all other bosses. Because moving around large sprites was difficult due to limited video RAM, Seven Force was built by combining circles and squares to make one large character. Maegawa claims the game could have never worked on the Super NES because the boss animations required expanded computing power. The standard enemy characters, designed by Han, were drawn on the screen by combining a top and bottom sprite, allowing for more animation patterns with lower memory usage. Han was inspired by the game &quot;Mazin Saga: Mutant Fighter&quot; (1993) to program the enemies manually rather than with mathematical algorithms. The game was 16 megabits but compressed to fit under 8.

== Release ==
Although &quot;McDonald&#x27;s Treasure Land Adventure&quot; was completed first, Treasure decided to wait and release &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; first because they wanted their debut to be an original game. It was nearly rejected for an American release by Sega of America, only being approved by Mac Senour, the last producer in the reviewing queue after 12 others rejected it. Senour believed the other producers dismissed the game because its small character sprites contrasted with the more popular large sprites at the time. Senour did ask Treasure to change one boss character because it looked too similar to Adolf Hitler.

&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; was released in Japan on September 10, 1993, and released in the West the same month. Sega underestimated demand in Japan where their initial shipment was only 10,000 units. Meanwhile, Sega of America also ordered a small initial print run, as they were not typically confident in games from Sega of Japan. The game was not heavily promoted and spread by word of mouth. &quot;GameFan&quot; particularly enjoyed the game and published the first English interview with Maegawa. The game shipped in total around 70,000 copies in Japan, and 200,000 overseas. An arcade version was also released for the Sega Mega-Play arcade board.

=== Ports and re-releases ===
A Game Gear port was developed by M2. Sega asked M2 if they wanted to make a Game Gear game after being impressed by their &quot;Gauntlet&quot; port for the Genesis. M2 wanted to port &quot;The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy&quot;, but they were ultimately handed &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;. Since the Genesis version pushed hardware limitations, a Game Gear port was difficult. The port had some changes, such as the Dice Palace being removed, and it ran at lower frame rate. It was released on March 24, 1995.

Sega released &quot;Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box&quot; in 2006 in Japan, a compilation of Treasure games for the PlayStation 2 as part of their &quot;Sega Ages 2500&quot; series. Included on the compilation were &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; (1994), and &quot;Alien Soldier&quot; (1995). The games are run through an emulator and include display options for filters and resolutions. The Japanese and international versions of each game were included, along with the Game Gear ports of &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; and &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot;, and a Genesis prototype of &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;. A gallery is included with scans of the original instruction manuals, concept illustrations, and design documents. This compilation was released digitally on the PlayStation Store in 2012.

The game was ported by M2 to the Nintendo 3DS in 2015 as part of Sega&#x27;s line of &quot;3D Classics&quot;. &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; was originally not considered for the series because converting the game&#x27;s backgrounds into a layered 3D effect was thought to be impossible, but these perceived problems were later overcome. In addition to supporting stereoscopic 3D, the game features two new game modes. &quot;Gunslinger&quot; mode starts the player with a full arsenal of every weapon type and grants the ability to change shot stance at any time, and &quot;Mega Life&quot; mode starts the player with double the normal amount of health. The game also supports local cooperative play and includes both the Japanese and international versions.

&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; has also been released on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Windows. A Sega Forever version for mobile devices was released in 2017. The game was again released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2021.

==Reception==

&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; achieved greater recognition than Treasure anticipated. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it their &quot;Game of the Month,&quot; and the game placed first in &quot;Beep! Mega Drive&quot;&#x27;s reader rankings in Japan. &quot;GameFan&quot; deemed it their &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and called it a new benchmark for action games. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; wrote that &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; was setting a new standard for action games on the Genesis, calling it &quot;a stunning title both in appearance and the gameplay it offers.&quot; &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; agreed, with one critic calling it &quot;one of the most intense games I&#x27;ve seen on the home video game scene.&quot; Both &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; and &quot;Sega Force&quot; felt the game was a must-buy for Genesis owners.

The game was praised for its fast and furious action. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;one of the most intense carts to date [...] nonstop intensity from beginning to end.&quot; &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; agreed, commending the variety in level design and the &quot;frantic, high-density blasting mayhem.&quot; &quot;Sega Force&quot; believed the game&#x27;s variety prevented it from falling into monotony, and instead, reinvigorated the platform genre. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; agreed, feeling gameplay customization options kept it feeling interesting and original. Some critics praised the player characters&#x27; acrobatics and attack maneuvers for adding excitement. &quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; &quot;chaos in a cart&quot; with &quot;murderous action, excellent controls, and imaginative game design.&quot; The game&#x27;s two-player cooperative mode was praised, although some felt there was too much clutter on the screen to tell the player characters apart.

The game&#x27;s graphics were highlighted by several critics, with &quot;GamePro&quot; calling it &quot;an assault on your senses.&quot; &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; felt the sprite rotating and scaling overshadowed the abilities of the Super NES. &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; also liked the sprite scaling, and highlighted its use on the boss &quot;Seven Force.&quot; Other critics also felt the bosses were well animated and designed, with some also extending their comments to the player characters&#x27; animations as well. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; commended the graphical explosion effects, with other critics praising the sound effects they were paired with for enhancing the game&#x27;s atmosphere. A critic from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;one of the best looking carts I&#x27;ve seen from Sega in a while.&quot;

=== Ports ===
Critics lauded the Game Gear port as a great 8-bit conversion. &quot;GameFan&quot; felt it was graphically advanced for a Game Gear game. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; agreed, thinking that the graphics remained true to the 16-bit original despite greater system limitations. The 3DS version was praised for the added options and enhancements, with &quot;USgamer&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; calling it the best version of the game. The mobile version was criticized for being difficult to play with touch controls.

==Legacy==
&quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; was listed as one of the best games ever made by several publications. Critics have called it a &quot;classic&quot; of the 16-bit era, with &quot;IGN&quot; writing that its pace and speed was &quot;nearly unrivaled&quot; at the time. Others called it one of the best Genesis games. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; called it &quot;one of the best two-player games ever made.&quot; &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that its chaotic and brash nature made it the &quot;quintessential classic-era Sega game&quot; in contrast to the more gentle offerings from Nintendo. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; called it &quot;an incredible accomplishment, both creatively and technically&quot; for the Genesis. Both &quot;TouchArcade&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; deemed it one of the best side-scrolling action games ever made.

Being Treasure&#x27;s debut game, &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; helped establish their reputation in the industry. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; wrote that the game &quot;blew open the state of 2D platform-shooters.&quot; Developers at the time borrowed inspiration for titles like &quot;Vectorman&quot; (1995) and &quot;Shinobi III&quot; (1993). Treasure also began to build a following of loyal hardcore fans, which &quot;USgamer&quot; felt was earned by &quot;a sense of integrity to Treasure&#x27;s work you don&#x27;t often see in games of that era.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot; wrote that between &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; and their other Genesis games, Treasure earned a reputation as a &quot;master of hardcore action gaming.&quot; Many of the design conventions Treasure used in &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; would return and became characteristic of Treasure&#x27;s later work, such as a quirky sense of humor and action taken to a level of absurdity. A sequel was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2005, &quot;Gunstar Super Heroes&quot;.

<doc id="1261603" wikidata="Q902979" url="?curid=1261603" title="Cold trap">
<text>In vacuum applications, a cold trap is a device that condenses all vapors except the permanent gases (hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) into a liquid or solid. The most common objective is to prevent vapors being evacuated from an experiment from entering a vacuum pump where they would condense and contaminate it. Particularly large cold traps are necessary when removing large amounts of liquid as in freeze drying.

Cold traps also refer to the application of cooled surfaces or baffles to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will be attached to the inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as a dry ice mixture, or by use of an electrically driven Peltier element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity.

==Applications==
Pumps that use oil either as their working fluid (diffusion pumps), or as their lubricant (mechanical rotary pumps), are often the sources of contamination in vacuum systems. Placing a cold trap at the mouth of such a pump greatly lowers the risk that oil vapours will backstream into the cavity.

Cold traps can also be used for experiments involving vacuum lines such as small-scale very low temperature distillations/condensations. This is accomplished through the use of a coolant such as liquid nitrogen or a freezing mixture of dry ice in acetone or a similar solvent with a low melting point. Liquid nitrogen is only used when dry ice or other cryogenic approaches will not condense the desired gasses since liquid nitrogen will also condense oxygen. Any oxygen gas content in the vacuum line or any leak in the vacuum line will result in liquid oxygen mixed with the target vapors, often with explosive results.

When performed on a larger scale, this technique is called freeze-drying, and the cold trap is referred to as the condenser.

Cold traps are also used in cryopump systems to generate hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water) into their liquid or solid forms.

An igloo or other snow bivouac may exploit the same principle – confinement of denser cool air within an impermeable lower volume – to reduce cold air reaching the occupants through use of a sump or cill around a raised sleeping platform within.

== Hazards ==
Care should be taken when using a cold trap not to condense oxygen gas into the cold trap, visible as light blue liquid. Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and this is especially true if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Oxygen can be condensed into a cold trap if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the trap is very cold, e.g. when cooled with liquid nitrogen. Besides oxygen, many hazardous gases emitted in reactions, e.g. sulfur dioxide, chloromethane, condense into cold traps.

==Construction==

Cold traps (C in the figure) usually consist of two parts: The bottom is a large, thick round tube with ground-glass joints (B in the figure), and the second is a cap (A in the figure), also with ground-glass connections. The length of the tube is usually selected so that, when assembled, the total reached is about half the length of the tube.

==Arrangement==

Cold traps should be assembled such that the down tube is connected to the source of gas whilst the cap is connected to the source of vacuum. Reversing this, connecting the down tube to the source of vacuum, places the inlet of the vacuum directly above the condensate, increasing the chances of vapour phase condensate moving up the (uncooled) down tube (towards the pump) or, should the trap begin to fill to an appreciable volume, liquid phase condensate being pulled into the pump.

<doc id="1261604" wikidata="Q933332" url="?curid=1261604" title="Jonathan Culler">
<text>Jonathan Culler (born 1944) is an American literary critic. He was Class of 1916 Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Cornell University. His published works are in the fields of structuralism, literary theory and literary criticism.

==Background and career==
Culler attended Harvard for his undergraduate studies, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history and literature in 1966. After receiving a Rhodes scholarship, he attended St. John&#x27;s College, Oxford University, where he earned a B. Phil (now M. Phil) in comparative literature (1968) and a D.Phil in modern languages (1972). His thesis for the B. Phil., on phenomenology and literary criticism, recorded Culler&#x27;s first experiences with structuralism. The thesis explored the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the criticism of the &quot;Geneva School&quot; using the ideas of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, and Ferdinand de Saussure. Culler&#x27;s &quot;expanded, reorganized and rewritten&quot; doctoral dissertation, &quot;Structuralism: The Development of Linguistic Models and Their Application to Literary Studies,&quot; became an influential prize-winning book, &quot;Structuralist Poetics&quot; (1975). 

Culler was Fellow in French and Director of Studies in Modern Languages at Selwyn College, Cambridge University, from 1969 to 1974, and Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford and University Lecturer in French from 1974 to 1977. He was Visiting Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Yale University in 1975. He is a past president of the Semiotic Society of America (1988), the American Comparative Literature Association (1999–2001), Secretary of the American Council of Learned Societies (2013–17), and Chair of the New York Council for the Humanities (2016–17). He has been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001–), the American Philosophical Society (2006–), and the British Academy (2020-).
Currently, he is Class of 1916 Professor of English and Comparative Literature, Emeritus, at Cornell University. He retired in 2019 after teaching for over fifty years. 

In the years 1971–1974 he was married to the poet Veronica Forrest-Thomson. Culler is now married to deconstructionist critic Cynthia Chase.

==Major works==
Culler&#x27;s &quot;Structuralist Poetics: Structuralism, Linguistics and the Study of Literature&quot; won the James Russell Lowell Prize from the Modern Language Association of America in 1976 for an outstanding book of criticism. &quot;Structuralist Poetics&quot; was one of the first introductions to the French structuralist movement available in English.

Culler&#x27;s contribution to the Very Short Introductions series, &quot;Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction&quot;, received praise for its innovative technique of organization. It has been translated into 26 languages, including Kurdish, Latvian, and Albanian. Instead of chapters on critical schools and their methods, the book&#x27;s eight chapters address issues and problems of literary theory.

In &quot;The Literary in Theory&quot; (2007) Culler discusses the notion of Theory and literary history&#x27;s role in the larger realm of literary and cultural theory. He defines Theory as an interdisciplinary body of work including structuralist linguistics, anthropology, Marxism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and literary criticism.

His &quot;Theory of the Lyric&quot; (2015) approaches the Western lyric tradition, from Sappho to Ashbery, exploring the major parameters of the genre and contesting two dominant models of the lyric: lyric as the intense expression of the author&#x27;s affective experience, and lyric as the fictional representation of the speech act of a persona. Both these models, according to Culler, are extremely limiting and ignore the specifically poetic aspects of lyric poetry, such as rhythm and sound patterning.

==Contributions to critical theory==
Culler believes that the linguistic-structuralist model can help &quot;formulate the rules of particular systems of convention rather than simply affirm their existence.&quot; He posits language and human culture as similar.

In &quot;Structuralist Poetics&quot; Culler warns against applying the technique of linguistics directly to literature. Rather, the &quot;&#x27;grammar&#x27; of literature&quot; is converted into literary structures and meaning. Structuralism is defined as a theory resting on the realization that if human actions or productions have meaning there must be an underlying system that makes this meaning possible, since an utterance has meaning only in the context of a preexistent system of rules and conventions.

Culler proposes that we use literary critical theory not to try to understand a text but rather to investigate the activity of interpretation. In several of his works, he speaks of a reader who is particularly &quot;competent&quot;. In order to understand how we make sense of a text, Culler identifies common elements that different readers treat differently in different texts. He suggests there are two classes of readers, &quot;the readers as field of experience for the critic (himself a reader)&quot; and the future readers who will benefit from the work the critic and previous readers have done.

Culler&#x27;s critics complain of his lack of distinction between literature and the institution of writing in general. John R. Searle has described Culler&#x27;s presentation of deconstruction as making &quot;Derrida look both better and worse than he really is;&quot; better in glossing over some of the more intellectually murky aspects of deconstruction and worse in largely ignoring the major philosophical progenitors of Derrida&#x27;s thought, namely Husserl and Heidegger.

<doc id="1261615" wikidata="Q946860" url="?curid=1261615" title="Rectangular function">
<text>The rectangular function (also known as the rectangle function, rect function, Pi function, Heaviside Pi function, gate function, unit pulse, or the normalized [[boxcar function]]) is defined as

formula_1

Alternative definitions of the function define formula_2 to be 0, 1, or undefined.

Its periodic version is called a &quot;rectangular wave&quot;.

==History==
The &quot;rect&quot; function has been introduced by Woodward in as an ideal cutout operator, together with the &quot;sinc&quot; function as an ideal interpolation operator, and their counter operations which are sampling (&quot;comb&quot; operator) and replicating (&quot;rep&quot; operator), respectively.

==Relation to the boxcar function==
The rectangular function is a special case of the more general boxcar function:

formula_3

where formula_4 is the Heaviside step function; the function is centered at formula_5 and has duration formula_6, from formula_7 to formula_8
==Fourier transform of the rectangular function==
The unitary Fourier transforms of the rectangular function are
formula_9
using ordinary frequency , where formula_10 is the normalized form of the sinc function and
formula_11
using angular frequency formula_12, where formula_13 is the unnormalized form of the sinc function.

For formula_14, its Fourier transform isformula_15

==Relation to the triangular function==
We can define the triangular function as the convolution of two rectangular functions:

formula_16

==Use in probability==

Viewing the rectangular function as a probability density function, it is a special case of the continuous uniform distribution with formula_17 The characteristic function is

formula_18

and its moment-generating function is

formula_19

where formula_20 is the hyperbolic sine function.

==Rational approximation==
The pulse function may also be expressed as a limit of a rational function:

formula_21

===Demonstration of validity===
First, we consider the case where formula_22 Notice that the term formula_23 is always positive for integer formula_24 However, formula_25 and hence formula_23 approaches zero for large formula_24

It follows that:
formula_28

Second, we consider the case where formula_29 Notice that the term formula_30 is always positive for integer formula_24 However, formula_32 and hence formula_30 grows very large for large formula_24

It follows that:
formula_35

Third, we consider the case where formula_36 We may simply substitute in our equation:

formula_37

We see that it satisfies the definition of the pulse function. Therefore,

formula_38

== Dirac delta function ==
The rectangle function can be used to represent the Dirac delta function formula_39. Specifically,formula_40For a function formula_41, its average over the width &quot;formula_42&quot; around 0 in the function domain is calculated as,

formula_43
To obtain formula_44, the following limit is applied,

formula_45
and this can be written in terms of the Dirac delta function as,
formula_46The Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function formula_47 is

formula_48
where the sinc function here is the normalized sinc function. Because the first zero of the sinc function is at formula_49 and formula_42 goes to infinity, the Fourier transform of formula_47 is

formula_52
means that the frequency spectrum of the Dirac delta function is infinitely broad. As a pulse is shorten in time, it is larger in spectrum.

<doc id="1261616" wikidata="Q837188" url="?curid=1261616" title="Ophthalmoscopy">
<text>Ophthalmoscopy, also called funduscopy, is a test that allows a health professional to see inside the fundus of the eye and other structures using an ophthalmoscope (or funduscope). It is done as part of an eye examination and may be done as part of a routine physical examination. It is crucial in determining the health of the retina, optic disc, and vitreous humor.

The pupil is a hole through which the eye&#x27;s interior can be viewed. For better viewing, the pupil can be opened wider (dilated; mydriasis) before ophthalmoscopy using medicated eye drops (dilated fundus examination). However, undilated examination is more convenient (albeit not as comprehensive), and is the most common type in primary care.

An alternative or complement to ophthalmoscopy is to perform a fundus photography, where the image can be analysed later by a professional.

==Types==
There are two major types of ophthalmoscopy:
* direct ophthalmoscopy, which produces an upright (unreversed) image of approximately 15× magnification
* indirect ophthalmoscopy, which produces an inverted (reversed) image of 2–5× magnification


Each type of ophthalmoscopy has a special type of ophthalmoscope:
* Direct ophthalmoscopy uses the direct ophthalmoscope, an instrument the size of a small flashlight with several lenses that can magnify up to about 15 times. This type of ophthalmoscope is most commonly used during a routine physical examination. The pan-ophthalmoscope has a larger primary lens with a variable focusing, allowing for a wider field-of-view.
* Indirect ophthalmoscopy uses the indirect ophthalmoscope, an instrument that has a light attached to a headband, in addition to a small handheld lens. It provides a wider view of the inside of the eye. Furthermore, it allows a better view of the fundus of the eye, even if the lens is clouded by cataracts. An indirect ophthalmoscope can be either monocular or binocular. It is used for peripheral viewing of the retina.

==Medical uses==

Ophthalmoscopy is done as part of a routine physical or complete eye examination, mainly by optometrists and ophthalmologists. It is used to detect and evaluate symptoms of various retinal vascular diseases and eye diseases.

In patients with headaches, the finding of swollen optic discs (papilledema) on ophthalmoscopy is a key sign indicating raised intracranial pressure, which may be due to conditions such as hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), and brain tumors. In glaucoma, cupped optic discs are seen. In patients with diabetes mellitus, regular ophthalmoscopic eye examinations (once every 6 months to 1 year) are important to screen for diabetic retinopathy, as visual loss due to diabetes can be prevented by retinal laser treatment if retinopathy is spotted early. In arterial hypertension, hypertensive changes of the retina closely mimic those in the brain and may predict cerebrovascular accidents (strokes).

==Dilating the pupil==
During ophthalmoscopy, the pupil constricts due to light from the ophthalmoscope. To allow for better inspection of the posterior eye through the pupil, it is often desirable to dilate (enlarge) the pupil by applying a mydriatic agent (e.g. tropicamide), or by reducing the ophthalmoscope&#x27;s brightness, which may slightly increase natural mydriasis.

Mydriatic agents are primarily considered ophthalmologist or optometrist equipment, but is used by other specialists as well, including neurologists and internists. Recent developments like scanning laser ophthalmoscopy can make good quality images through pupils as small as , so dilating the pupil is not necessary with these methods.

==History==

=== Early models ===
The first instrument for looking into the eye was first invented in 1847 by British inventor Charles Babbage. However, he was unable to obtain an image with the instrument when showing it to ophthalmologist Thomas Wharton Jones, and thus became discouraged to proceed further. The instrument is described by Jones as follows:

Later in 1851, German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz invented the ophthalmoscope again independently. At that time, Helmholtz was a young physiology professor and wanted to demonstrate to his students why the pupil was sometimes black and sometimes light. He wrote about his ophthalmoscope in detail and demonstrated that it required three essential components (which remain true today):

* a source of illumination (Helmholtz used a candle)
* a method of reflecting the light into the eye
* an optical method for correcting an unsharp image of the fundus

Helmholtz called his instrument an (&#x27;eye mirror&#x27;). The name &quot;ophthalmoscope&quot; only came into common use in 1854, three years after the instrument&#x27;s invention.

=== Later improvements ===
Helmholtz&#x27;s first ophthalmoscope could not correct for refractive errors in the patient and/or the observer. This limitation was solved in 1852 by Helmholtz&#x27; machinist, Egbert Rekoss, who added two rotatable discs that each contained a few lenses. These wheels of lenses were superior to other early opthalmoscopes which used separate individual lenses that were inconvenient to change. The discs are known as the &quot;Rekoss Disc&quot; and continue to be used on most hand-held ophthalmoscopes today.

Observing the eye&#x27;s interior required alignment of the observer&#x27;s vision and the light source. This was discovered by William Cumming, a young ophthalmologist at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, who wrote that &quot;every eye could be made luminous if the axis from a source of illumination directed towards a person&#x27;s eye and the line of vision of the observer were coincident&quot;. To eliminate this variable, some (including Lionel Beale) created ophthalmoscopes with an attached light source.

While training in France, Greek ophthalmologist Andreas Anagnostakis came up with the idea of making the instrument hand-held by adding a concave mirror. Austin Barnett created a model for Anagnostakis, which he used in his practice and subsequently presented at the first Ophthalmological Conference in Brussels in 1857, which made the instrument very popular among ophthalmologists.

The invention of the incandescent light bulb further enabled the ophthalmoscope to be self-luminous instead of relying on an external and remote source of illumination. The first ophthalmoscope to have an installed light bulb was created by William Dennet, who presented his invention to the American Ophthalmological Society in 1885, though it was unreliable as the light bulb&#x27;s life was short and unpredictable.

The ophthalmoscope was further improved in 1915 by G.S. Crampton, who added a battery to the handle for powering the light source, thus making the instrument portable.

In 1915, Francis A. Welch and William Noah Allyn invented the world&#x27;s first hand-held direct-illuminating ophthalmoscope. The company Welch Allyn started as a result of this invention. In the 2000s, the company developed a new design of ophthalmoscope called the &quot;Panoptic&quot;. The instrument produced an image with a field-of-view five times larger than conventional direct ophthalmoscopes.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;ophthalmoscopy&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;viewing the eye&quot;. The word &quot;funduscopy&quot; () derives from &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, yielding &quot;viewing the far inside&quot;. The idea that &quot;fundus&quot; can and should correspond to a combining form &quot;fundo-&quot; drives the formation of an alternate form, &quot;fundoscopy&quot; (&quot;fundo-&quot; + &quot;-scopy&quot;), which is the subject of a descriptive-versus-prescriptive difference in acceptance. Some dictionaries enter the &quot;fundo-&quot; form as a second-listed variant, but others do not enter it at all, and one prescribes its avoidance with a usage note.

<text>Garry Guzzo (born November 18, 1941) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003. He represented the ridings of Ottawa–Rideau and Ottawa West—Nepean.

==Background==
Guzzo was educated at the University of Ottawa. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree and a law degree. He practiced as a lawyer with the firm of Chiarelli and Guzzo from 1969 to 1976, and was a provincial court judge from 1978 to 1989. He briefly served as counsel with the firm Kelly, Howard, and Santini and then operated a private practice in Ottawa until 1999. He also served as a director of the city&#x27;s Riverside Hospital.

==Politics==
Guzzo was elected for a three-year term to Ottawa City Council as an alderman for Capital Ward in 1969.

In the provincial election of 1971, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Ottawa Centre. He came within 182 votes of defeating future New Democratic Party leader Michael Cassidy. From 1974 to 1976, he served as a Councillor in the regional municipality of Ottawa-Carleton.

Guzzo ran for the Ontario legislature a second time in the provincial election of 1995, and defeated Liberal incumbent Yvonne O&#x27;Neill by about 1,500 votes in the riding of Ottawa—Rideau. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in this election under Mike Harris; despite being the only Tory Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) from Ottawa, however, Guzzo was not appointed to cabinet.

In the 1999 provincial election, Guzzo won re-election in the redistributed riding of Ottawa West—Nepean against Liberal Rick Chiarelli and New Democratic incumbent Alex Cullen. (The Harris government had previously reduced the number of ridings from 130 to 103, forcing several incumbents to face one another for re-election.) He was again left out of the cabinet in the parliament which followed, and became best known for a private member&#x27;s bill calling for an investigation into rumours of an organized pedophile ring in Cornwall, Ontario.

In 2003, Guzzo criticized his own government for unveiling its budget at the headquarters of Magna International, rather than in the legislature. Later in the year, he courted controversy by making favourable comments about former United States Senator Joseph McCarthy, and criticizing &quot;illegal refugees&quot; for burdening the province&#x27;s taxation system. These comments may have contributed to his defeat in the provincial election of 2003; Guzzo lost to former Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson by just under 3,000 votes.

<doc id="1261644" wikidata="Q497554" url="?curid=1261644" title="Christoph Demantius">
<text>Johann Christoph Demantius (15 December 1567 – 20 April 1643) was a German composer, music theorist, writer and poet. He was an exact contemporary of Monteverdi, and represented a transitional phase in German Lutheran music from the polyphonic Renaissance style to the early Baroque.

==Life==
He was born in Reichenberg (now Liberec, in the Czech Republic, north of Prague near the border with Germany), and probably received his early training there, though little information is available about his early life. By the early 1590s he was in Bautzen, where he wrote a school textbook, and in 1593 he received a degree from the University of Wittenberg. In 1594 he moved to Leipzig, and in 1597 he acquired the post of Kantor at Zittau, where he probably taught the young Melchior Franck.

His next post, one he held for the rest of his life, was as Kantor to Freiberg Cathedral. While he was able to keep his position, the Thirty Years&#x27; War was disruptive to his life, and most of his children, of four different marriages, died due to the hardships imposed by the war.

==Works==
Demantius was a hugely prolific composer, though many of his works have been lost. Stylistically he was a successor to Lassus, who was also working in Germany during the first part of Demantius&#x27;s life. He wrote most of his music before the Thirty Years&#x27; War; it is probable that the hardships of the war, including lack of performing musicians, made it difficult to compose and publish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blankenburg/Schröder, Grove online&quot;&gt;Blankenburg/Schröder, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;

In the realm of sacred music Demantius wrote motets, masses, Magnificat settings, psalm settings, hymns, and a splendid setting of the &quot;St. John Passion&quot;, one of the most significant passion settings of the late Renaissance. This work, for six voices, is considered to be the last in the development of the German motet passion; those composed later were to be of the more dramatic kind, culminating in the &quot;St John Passion&quot; of J.S. Bach. Demantius&#x27;s setting includes a setting of Isaiah chapter 53 in addition to the usual text from the Gospel of St. John.

His motets are of a late Renaissance type, and all Lutheran; some are in German and others Latin. They are conservative in that they avoid some of the Italian Baroque innovations such as the concertato style and the basso continuo, both of which were becoming widely used in Germany by 1610; but he also created a highly individual musical language using traditional forms and means, quite distinct from the Palestrinian polyphony adopted by the other composers of the time commonly regarded as &quot;conservative.&quot;

He also wrote secular music, both vocal and instrumental, including threnodies, dances, epithalamia, and numerous other occasional works. Most likely he wrote the poetry for his own music.

As a music theoretician he is famous for compiling the first dictionary of musical terms in the German language. He also published a textbook for teaching music in school, &quot;Forma musices&quot;, in 1592, at Bautzen.

<text>William Francis Baxter, Jr. (July 13, 1929 – November 27, 1998) was a law professor at Stanford University. His specialty was antitrust law.

==Antitrust Law==
As Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice from 1981–1983, Baxter commanded wide public attention when in 1982 he settled a seven-year-old case against AT&amp;T with by far the largest breakup in the history of the Sherman Antitrust Act, splitting AT&amp;T up into seven regional phone companies. On that same day, he dismissed as &quot;without merit&quot; a seemingly endless, thirteen-year-old suit against IBM, which had employed more than 300 lawyers and generated 2,500 depositions and 66 million pages of documents. Additionally, under his leadership, the U.S. Justice Department promulgated revised guidelines that it would use to enforce U.S. antitrust laws going forward. As part of that practice, he is the author of Baxter&#x27;s Law or the Bell Doctrine.

==Animal Rights==
In 1974, Baxter published a widely read and influential book on the law and economics of pollution control entitled &quot;People or Penguins: The Case for Optimal Pollution&quot;. This book, though aimed at a law audience, contains a philosophically sophisticated stance on the topic of animal rights.

Baxter maintains that non-human animals have no moral consideration on their own. Any moral consideration of animals is in relation to humans. Moral consideration is a uniquely &quot;human&quot; affair. This differs from the view that there is no essential difference between the pain of non-human animals and that of human beings (see Peter Singer), and also differs from the view that the pain of animals is a morally relevant consideration, but is not morally decisive (See Bonnie Steinbock).

It is important to note that Baxter is not antipathetic toward non-human animals; in fact, he points out that many things that are in the interests of animals (and the larger environment for that matter) are in fact also in the best interests of humans as well. In this sense we have obligations to how we treat non-human animals, but the grounds is only because of the respective impact on human beings.

Baxter states that the way to measure these humans interests are in terms of a cost benefit analysis, where cost doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean uniquely monetary costs.

<doc id="1261657" wikidata="Q7865108" url="?curid=1261657" title="UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc.">
<text>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc., 92 F. Supp. 2d 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) was a landmark case of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York concerning the unauthorized copying of copyrighted materials on the Internet. The case concerned unauthorized duplication by the company MP3.com of songs from a wide selection of compact discs for the purposes of launching a service that allowed users to access their private music collections online from anywhere in the world. This business model was ruled to be a violation of American copyright law.

== Background ==
Upon the rise of music file sharing by consumers on the Internet, MP3.com conceived a new service in early 2000 called My.MP3.com that allowed users to rip songs from compact discs that they had already purchased legitimately, then upload the resulting MP3 files to an account managed by MP3.com. The users would then be able to log into their accounts from any Internet-connected device anywhere in the world, and listen to the music that they had previously uploaded. Users quickly compiled a library of over 80,000 albums, with the songs stored on servers at MP3.com. The company also attempted to expand the library by buying tens of thousands of albums on compact disc itself, and adding those to the library to be accessed by its users.

To use the service, the My.MP3.com subscriber had to &quot;confirm&quot; that they had legitimately purchased the CD by placing it in their computer&#x27;s CD drive while logged in to My.MP3.com, thus allowing a purchase code to be recorded by the service. A subscriber could also purchase a CD from one of defendant&#x27;s cooperating online retailers. Despite this process, the record companies argued that MP3.com had made few efforts to ensure that the songs being uploaded by its users had in fact been legitimately purchased in CD form.

Eleven different record companies, with UMG Recordings serving as the lead plaintiff, sued MP3.com for failing to secure permission for copies of songs that were created automatically when users uploaded ripped songs to the company&#x27;s servers. MP3.com argued that the owners of compact discs were entitled to make copies of copyrighted songs that they had purchased legitimately, and give them to any selected party (including an online service) per the fair use defense in American copyright law, as well as the first sale doctrine. MP3.com also claimed that its business plan helped the record industry by enabling music fans to enjoy their purchased music outside of the home.

MP3.com also argued that a copied MP3 file suffered from lesser audio fidelity and lower quality than the equivalent song on a compact disc, so the files in its My.MP3.com library constituted transformative use under copyright law. MP3.com also accused the record companies of copyright misuse by filing a lawsuit for purposes of revenge, while its subscribers were simply engaged in space shifting &quot;–&quot; consuming their purchased media in different environments &quot;–&quot; which had been upheld by several Supreme Court precedents.

== Opinion of the court ==
As stated by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in his opinion: “The complex marvels of cyberspatial communication may create difficult legal issues, but not in this case.” Rakoff rejected arguments by MP3.com that its service merely allowed listeners to practice space shifting, stating that &quot;stripped to its essence, defendant&#x27;s &#x27;consumer protection&#x27; argument amounts to nothing more than a bold claim that defendant should be able to misappropriate plaintiff&#x27;s property simply because there is a consumer demand for it. This hardly appeals to the conscience of equity.&quot;

Rakoff also ruled that given recent advances in computing technology and the playback devices used by the typical music consumer, an MP3 file was not substantially different in quality from a compact disc, so a ripped file does not qualify as transformative use under copyright law, while MP3.com&#x27;s claim that it was protecting or enhancing the music industry was rejected because the service infringed on the companies&#x27; distribution rights.

== Impact ==
With this decision, the court drew a distinction between traditional space shifting, which had previously been allowed for video cassettes and other physical media, and &quot;virtual&quot; space shifting as practiced by My.MP3.com. This type of virtual space shifting required the creation of a copy at the MP3.com servers, which in turn required authorization from the copyright owners under copyright law.

&quot;UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc.&quot; was cited at the time as an important decision in the then-burgeoning practice of file sharing and the trading of unauthorized music and media files on the Internet. However, some scholars argued that the ruling only addressed the specific business model practiced by My.MP3.com, and left larger file sharing trends on the Internet unaddressed, particularly those practices not covered by a legitimate (if unsuccessful) business plan. The ruling also neglected to address any responsibilities that the legacy record companies may or may not have had in the management of their own copyrighted products and preventing them from being illegally traded.

This ruling resulted in several additional legal claims against MP3.com, with the company ultimately owing more than $150 million to legacy record companies. The judgments pushed MP3.com into severe financial difficulties which were averted by a merger with Vivendi Universal.

<doc id="1261663" wikidata="Q3330920" url="?curid=1261663" title="Mutant League Football">
<text>Mutant League Football is a video game that was originally released in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game was designed using the &quot;John Madden Football &#x27;93&quot; engine, and features a different take on American football, where it resembles a war as much as a sporting competition.

A year later, the same team applied similar concepts to the sport of ice hockey to create &quot;Mutant League Hockey&quot;. An animated TV series based around the games, &quot;Mutant League&quot;, aired from July 1994 to February 1996, while a spiritual successor, &quot;Mutant Football League&quot; was released in 2017.

== Gameplay ==

The game deviates from usual football simulations in several ways. It most notably takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where radiation has caused the human race to mutate and the dead to rise from the grave. The instruction manual states that the exact causes of the upheaval have been lost or corrupted, due to (among many things) the chaos of an alien invasion, spin control, a sloppy filing system set up by a temp, and what appears to be barbecue sauce.

Landmines, fire pits, and other hazards (such as areas being open to empty space) litter the field, which can be made of rock, ice, or even toxic waste or rubber. Players can lose health or die during the run of play which will cause them to fumble. Teams have special &quot;Nasty Audibles&quot;, which are dirty, violent tricks such as exploding balls, invisibility, electric shocks, jet packs, or tackling the other quarterback with the intent to kill. All of this can result in large gains and/or horrific casualties. Killing enough players causes an opposing team to forfeit.

Each team can &quot;bribe ref&quot; twice per game (once in each half). The bribed referee will call phony penalties (e.g. 5-yard penalty for crying) on the opposing team. This will last for a few plays, but the other team usually tries to kill him (one of the Nasty Audibles that can actually be played at any time) immediately after the first dirty call. A slain ref is then replaced by an even tougher one, who will promptly call another 5-yard penalty on the murdering team for Ref Bashing. Note that accidental referee deaths, such as being caught in the middle of a pileup, or nudged into a mine, are not penalized. Other penalties include offsides (encroachment also counts as this penalty), illegal kick, delay of game, QB bashing, and pass interference. All of these penalties are 5-yard penalties except pass interference, which is an automatic first down.

Gameplay can take place in the form of a pickup game or full-season mode. Winning the championship game in season mode results in the losing team exploding spontaneously, and the winning team&#x27;s MVP perishing by induction into the &quot;Hole of Flame&quot;. The induction ceremony depicts the game referees snatching the MVP and stuffing him into a firepit.

== Teams ==
Teams are composed of aliens, skeletons, robots, trolls, and superhumans. Seven players are on the field for each team, instead of the usual eleven. Many of the teams are based on real life teams, with names like the Deathskin Razors and the Midway Monsters. Players also have humorous names, like Bones Jackson (Bo Jackson), L.T. Impaler (Lawrence Taylor), Joe Magician (Joe Montana) and Scary Ice (Jerry Rice). However, despite all of the death and destruction, the competition aspect is still high, and requires much strategy, especially compared to games like &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;.

== Legacy ==
This game was followed by a spin-off titled &quot;Mutant League Hockey&quot;. A basketball game, &quot;Mutant League Basketball&quot;, was in development, but was never released. These games were also used as the basis for an animated series called &quot;Mutant League&quot;, which aired from 1994 to 1996. Another spin-off, &quot;Mutant Speed Demons&quot;, was planned, but never released. However, a non-working prototype was found in 2009.

The game inspired a one-off series in the British children&#x27;s comic &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;. The story, entitled &quot;Bring Me the Head of Coach Brikka&quot;, ran for 6 episodes in 1994.

Electronic Arts included the game in the PlayStation Portable (PSP) compilation &quot;EA Replay&quot;. It was released in the United States on November 14, 2006. The PSP allowed a higher resolution for the game than seen on the Genesis, therefore bringing better graphics to the game when played on a television screen via the new PSP Slim &amp; Lite&#x27;s output capabilities.

In the Xbox 360 version of the video game &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot;, there is an achievement worth 50 gamerscore titled &quot;Midway Monster&quot;. The achievement is unlocked by creating a player named &quot;Bones Jackson&quot; and placing him on the Chicago Bears.

A spiritual successor called &quot;Mutant Football League&quot; has been developed by Digital Dreams Entertainment for the PC, Xbox One, PS4, and mobile platforms. This has been headed up by Michael Mendheim, the original creator and lead designer of the &quot;Mutant League&quot; series.

<text>Terrence Edward Kennedy (born June 4, 1956) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher who played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1978–80), San Diego Padres (1981–86), Baltimore Orioles (1987–88) and San Francisco Giants (1989–91). He was a four-time All-Star, three times with the Padres and once with the Orioles. Kennedy batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He is the son of former major league player and manager Bob Kennedy.

==Early life==
Born in Euclid, Ohio, Kennedy attended St. Mary&#x27;s High School (Phoenix, Arizona) before playing college baseball at Florida State University. He was a two-time All-American and Sporting News College Player of the Year in 1976. Kennedy was inducted into the FSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 1982.

==Career==
In a 14-year major league career, Kennedy hit .264 with 113 home runs and 628 RBI in 1491 games. Kennedy tied Johnny Bench&#x27;s NL mark of 40 doubles in a season in 1982. That same year, Kennedy won the Silver Slugger Award. He appeared in four All-Star Games (1981, 1983, 1985, and 1987). He also played in two World Series, with the Padres in 1984 and with the Giants in 1989. Terry and his father, Bob, became the first father and son duo to drive in runs in a World Series when Terry drove in two against the Tigers in 1984 in his first at bat.

Throughout most of his career, Kennedy wore #16, which he was assigned on his first day in major league camp with the Cardinals. When he came to the Orioles, he could not get #16 because veteran pitcher Scott McGregor already had the number, so he wore #15 during his time with them. He reverted to #16 during his time with the Giants, during which he took part in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 World Series.

After his playing days, Kennedy managed, coached, and instructed in the minor leagues for the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, as well as the Independent Leagues. Kennedy was voted Manager of the Year twice, including Baseball America Manager of the Year in 1998, when he led the Iowa Cubs to a first-place finish.

Kennedy is a scout with the Chicago Cubs.

<doc id="1261673" wikidata="Q270069" url="?curid=1261673" title="7×57mm Mauser">
<text>The 7×57mm Mauser (designated as the 7 mm Mauser or 7×57mm by the SAAMI and 7 × 57 by the C.I.P.) is a first-generation smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was developed by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company in 1892 and adopted as a military cartridge by Spain in 1893. It was subsequently adopted by several other countries as the standard military cartridge, and although now obsolete as a military cartridge, it remains in widespread international use as a sporting round. The 7×57 Mauser (originally known in Britain as the .275) was a popular stalking cartridge and sporting rifles in this chambering were made by the famous British riflemakers, such as John Rigby, Holland and Holland, Westley Richards and others. British cartridge nomenclature designated caliber in inches, and the cartridge was known as the .275 bore after the measurement of a 7 mm rifle&#x27;s bore across the lands. While some have stated that the cartridge is erroneously referred to as the &quot;.275 Rigby&quot;, both Rigby &amp; Sons and Kynoch (another UK ammunition firm) sold the cartridge in boxes labeled .275 Rigby. 

== History ==
Paul Mauser visited the Kingdom of Spain in 1892 after the delivery of trial rifles in 1891 and brought with him a new rifle designed to use a new cartridge of 7 mm caliber. Judging by the dimensions of the casing, it was developed from Mauser&#x27;s Patrone 88 adopted into German service: in fact, its derivative, 6.5×57mm Mauser, was marketed as &quot;M88/57/6.5 mit und ohne Rand&quot; in a 1921 catalog. Like the 7.65×53mm Mauser introduced in 1889, he had developed the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge for use with the new smokeless propellant, introduced as Poudre B in the 1886 pattern 8×50mmR Lebel, which started a military rifle ammunition revolution. At the time of its development 7×57mm Mauser was a high-performance smokeless-powder cartridge.

The Mauser Model 1892 rifle turned out to be a transitional design that was manufactured in limited numbers for the Spanish Army. It was quickly improved to the Mauser Model 1893 featuring a new internal box magazine where the cartridges were stored in a staggered column. The Spaniards were so impressed with the Mauser Model 1892 and 1893 rifles and their new 7×57mm Mauser cartridge that they not only ordered rifles and ammunition from Mauser, but also awarded him the Grand Cross of the Spanish Military Order of Merit, the highest decoration Mauser ever received.

== Cartridge dimensions ==
The 7×57mm cartridge has 3.90 ml (60 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt-action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions.

7×57mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 20.55 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 220 mm (1 in 8.66 in), 4 grooves, diameter of lands = , diameter of grooves = , land width = and the primer type is large rifle.

European 7 mm cartridges all have 7.24 mm (0.285 in) grooves diameter. American 7 mm cartridges have 7.21 mm (0.284 in) grooves diameter.

According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&#x27;Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the 7×57mm case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.

The SAAMI maximum average pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is piezo pressure or 46,000 CUP. This lower specification is in deference to the Remington Rolling block rifles that may still be in circulation. Concerns regarding the early Mauser rifles such as the models 93 and 95 are misplaced, as the original ammunition issued with the M93 Spanish Mauser produced an average pressure of 50,370 CUP in those rifles.

== 7×57mmR (rimmed) ==
A rimmed cartridge was developed from the 7×57mm shortly after its introduction for use in break-action rifles and combination guns. A rimmed cartridge greatly simplifies the issues of designing an extractor, particularly in a combination gun or &quot;drilling&quot; which must also be designed to extract rimmed shotgun shells. While various modern break-action and single-shot rifle and pistol designs have been developed that can reliably extract rimless cartridges, most of these date from the 1970s or later. While the external dimensions of the two versions are nearly identical other than the rim, there are differences in the internal design. In particular, the cartridge web, the area immediately above the rim on the rimmed version or the rebate on the rimless version, is thinner in the rimmed case, and some authorities recommend limiting the rimmed cartridge to 41,000 CUP because of this.

== Sporting round ==

The ballistics of the 7×57mm became popular with deer and plains game hunters. The relatively flat trajectory and manageable recoil ensured its place as a sportsman&#x27;s cartridge. The 7×57mm can offer very good penetrating ability due to a fast twist rate that enables it to fire long, heavy bullets with a high sectional density. This made it popular in Africa, where it was used on animals up to and including elephants, for which it was particularly favoured by noted ivory hunter W.D.M. &quot;Karamojo&quot; Bell, who shot about 800 African elephants with 1893 pattern 7×57mm military ball ammunition using Rigby Mauser 98 rifles, when most ivory hunters were using larger-caliber rifles. Bell selected the cartridge for moderate recoil, and relied on the long round-nosed military full metal jacket bullets for penetration.

The 7×57mm was also the favored cartridge of Eleanor O&#x27;Connor, wife of famous hunter and author Jack O&#x27;Connor. Eleanor accompanied her husband on multiple hunting expeditions all over the world, killing small and large game with the 7×57mm. Jack O&#x27;Connor also made extensive use of the round and remarked that &quot;I think I have seen more game killed with fewer shots from this modest little cartridge than with any other.&quot; Though not as popular today, the 7×57mm is still produced by most major ammunition manufacturers and many modern rifles are available chambered for the cartridge. The cartridge is more popular in Europe than in the United States and most European gunmakers chamber rifles in 7×57mm. (Although they don&#x27;t export them to the USA.)

The 7×57mm round was also used by the Indian hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett to put down the infamous man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag besides a few other Man-Eaters of Kumaon. Corbett&#x27;s writings mention using the .275 in a Rigby-made Mauser 1898 sporting rifle with attached torch to despatch the leopard on a dark summer night in May 1926. For man-eating tigers, Corbett preferred the .450/400 Nitro Express cartridge in a double-barreled configuration from W.J. Jeffery &amp; Co as the .400 Jeffery Nitro Express rifle but retained the Rigby Mauser as a backup weapon.

The 7×57 is able to handle a wide range of projectile weights, is easy to reload, has relatively mild recoil, and is accurate. Some rifle metallic silhouette shooters use 7×57.

== Military use ==
The military of the Kingdom of Spain adopted the Mauser Model 1893 rifle. It was chambered for the new 7×57mm Mauser cartridge. The original cartridge featured a long, round-nose, full-metal-jacketed bullet with a muzzle velocity of about with muzzle energy from a barreled rifle. For the late 19th century, these ballistics were impressive, and the loading provided a fairly flat trajectory combined with excellent penetration. At the same time, it exhibited relatively modest free recoil. That was a combination of attributes that made it popular with both soldiers and sportsmen alike.

The qualities of the 7×57mm as a military round were shown in the Spanish–American War of 1898. At the commencement of the American assault on the strategic Cuban city of Santiago, 750 Spanish troops defended positions on San Juan and Kettle hills. The attacking force numbered approximately 6,600 American soldiers, most of them armed with new smokeless-powder Krag–Jørgensen rifles in .30-40 Krag caliber, and supported by artillery and Gatling gun fire. Though the assault was successful, the Americans suffered more than 1,400 casualties, nearly 20 per cent of their forces. A U.S. board of investigation later concluded that the casualties were primarily due to the superior firepower of the Spanish Model 1893 Mauser rifles.

During the Second Boer War in South Africa, British authorities were obliged to re-evaluate rifle and ammunition design and tactics after facing Boer sharpshooters and snipers armed with Mauser Model 1893 rifles and Mauser Model 1895 rifles firing 7×57mm rounds with withering effectiveness, easily outranging the .303 British cartridge as regarding accurate long-range fire. The .303 British cartridge at that time was still using cordite propellant, in contrast to the Mauser&#x27;s higher-performance ballistite type smokeless powder.

== Military ammunition ==
The oldest 1893 pattern military ball ammunition was loaded with an long round-nosed bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel. It had a maximum range of . In 1893 this ballistic performance made it the high-performance service cartridge champion of its day when compared to other 1893 pattern smokeless-powder cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel, .303 British, and 8×50mmR Mannlicher.

In 1913, following the lead of French and German Army commands in developing the &quot;spitzer&quot; or pointed-tip bullet shape, the Spanish ordnance authorities issued a redesigned 7×57mm cartridge with a spitzer bullet (&quot;7 mm Cartucho para Mauser Tipo S&quot;). It was loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel. It had a maximum range of . The new spitzer bullet style was partially responsible for the cartridge&#x27;s improved performance as it significantly reduced air drag within normal combat ranges and withstood higher accelerations in the barrel. Reverse engineering the trajectory from the previous sentence indicates a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.33.

After that, military ball ammunition loaded with a spitzer bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of with muzzle energy from a long barrel became available. Besides a pointed nose, this projectile also had a boat tail to reduce drag. It had a maximum range of . Reverse engineering the trajectory from the previous sentence indicates a ballistic coefficient (G1 BC) of approximately 0.54.

== Use as a parent case ==
6.5×57mm Mauser was created by Paul Mauser himself by necking down the 7×57mm already in 1890s. 5.6×57mm was created by RWS in 1960s in a similar way. Both cartridges also have rimmed variants for break-action hunting rifles, 6.5×57mmR and 5.6×57mmR respectively.

The .257 Roberts uses the 7×57mm Mauser as its parent cartridge. The 6mm Remington is also based on the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge.

The 7×57mm Mauser was also the parent case of the 6×57mm Mauser developed in 1895.

== Wildcats ==
The 7×57mm Mauser is also used as the parent case for a host of modified variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. These cartridges are known as wildcat cartridges.
The US wildcat cartridge developer P.O. Ackley developed several 7×57mm Mauser based wildcat cartridges.
The 7×57mm Mauser Ackley Improved is an alternate version of the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge with 40 degree shoulder. This wildcat was designed to be easily made by rechambering existing firearms, and fire forming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity with the trade-off of a smaller bullet. Reloading dies for this wildcat chambering are readily available.
The .228 Ackley Magnum is also based on the 7×57mm Mauser cartridge but is also necked down to .228 caliber (5.79 mm). Bullets in this caliber are hard to find but provide greater weight than .223 caliber bullets, up to 100 grains (6.5 g), without excessively quick twist rate.
The .257 Roberts Ackley Improved is a second generation wildcat cartridge based on the .257 Roberts cartridge.

<text>NKVD Order No. 00593, also known as NKVD Order about Harbinites (приказ НКВД о харбинцах, (&quot;Харбинский приказ&quot;) by September 20, 1937, undersigned by Nikolai Yezhov regulated arrest and prosecution of former Russian personnel (Harbin Russians) of the China Far East Railway (KVZhD), who had lived in Harbin and reemigrated into the Soviet Union after 1935, when the KVZhD was sold to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo.

==Background==
The Chinese Eastern Railway (KVZhD) was constructed in 1897—1903. After the Russo-Japanese War, the southern portion of the railway was ceded to Japan, which created the South Manchuria Railway out of the former Russian portion of the railway. 

In the 1920s, some 120,000 Russian citizens lived in Manchuria. 43,500 persons, 64.5% of the population of Harbin, were Russians. The Russian population began to steadily drop as economic conditions deteriorated due to the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, causing high rates of unemployment. 

Emigration from Northern Manchuria to the Soviet Union increased in the 1930s as the Soviet Government sold the railway to Manchukuo, accelerating as some 19,570 residents left Manchuria to the Soviet Union in 1935 alone.

==Order No. 00593==
By 1935, the NKVD began actively persecuting Harbin repatriates. Yezhov&#x27;s order to arrest and execute the Harbinites stated that of 25,000 registered &quot;Harbinites&quot; the majority were former White Guardists, &quot;emigre spying-fascist organizations&quot;, former policemen etc. and worked for the Japanese intelligence service.

It was ordered to perform arrests (from October 1, 1937 to December 25, 1937) of all Harbinites that fell into 13 pre-defined categories. Those who didn&#x27;t match any of the listed categories were to be immediately removed from all jobs related to transport and industry.

Soviet intelligence conducted an investigation of Harbin emigres who had recently repatriated to Voronezh Oblast, concluding that out of 2,500 persons investigated, 248 were former members of the White army or intelligence services and 108 were members of overseas political organizations.

== Implementation ==

The operation lasted beyond the deadline of December 25th.

According to the data collected by Memorial, 48,133 Harbinites were repressed, of which whom 30,992 were shot.

Order No. 00593 instructed to handle the family members of the arrested according to the NKVD Order No. 00486 about family members of &quot;traitors to the Motherland&quot;.

<doc id="1261679" wikidata="Q3552503" url="?curid=1261679" title="Cold urticaria">
<text>Cold urticaria (essentially meaning cold hives) is a disorder in which large red welts called hives (&quot;urticaria&quot;) form on the skin after exposure to a cold stimulus. The hives are usually itchy and often the hands, feet and other parts of the body will become itchy and swollen as well. Hives vary in size from about in diameter to as big as about or larger.

This disorder, or perhaps two disorders with the same clinical manifestations, can be inherited (&quot;familial cold urticaria&quot;) or acquired (&quot;primary acquired cold urticaria&quot;). The acquired form is most likely to begin between ages 18 and 25, although it can occur as early as 5 years old in some cases. Life-threatening risks include suffocation resulting from swollen tissue (pharyngeal angioedema) induced by cold foods or beverages, drowning after shock from swimming in cold water, and anaphylactic shock.

== Types ==
Cold urticaria may be divided into the following types:

===Primary cold contact urticaria===
Primary cold contact urticaria is a cutaneous condition characterized by , and occurs in rainy, windy weather, and after swimming in cold water and after contact with cold objects, including ice cubes.

===Secondary cold contact urticaria===
Secondary cold contact urticaria is a cutaneous condition characterized by , due to serum abnormalities such as cryoglobulinemia or cryofibrinogenemia are extremely rare, and are then associated with other manifestations such as Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon or purpura.

===Reflex cold urticaria===
Reflex cold urticaria is a cutaneous condition in which generalized cooling of the body induces widespread ing.

===Familial cold urticaria===
Familial cold urticaria (also properly known as familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, FCAS) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, fever/chills and arthralgias elicited by exposure to cold – sometimes temperatures below .

It has been mapped to CIAS1 and is a slightly milder member of the disease family including Muckle–Wells syndrome and NOMID. It is rare and is estimated as having a prevalence of 1 per million people and mainly affects Americans and Europeans.

FCAS is one of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) caused by mutations in the CIAS1/NALP3 (aka NLRP3) gene at location 1q44.

The effect of FCAS on the quality of life of patients is far reaching. A survey of patients in the United States in 2008 found that &quot;[t]o cope with their underlying disease and to try to avoid symptomatic, painful, flares patients reported limiting their work, school, family, and social activities. Seventy-eight percent of survey participants described an impact of the disease on their work, including absenteeism and impaired job advancement; frequently, they quit their job as a consequence of their disease&quot;.

Treatment using anakinra (Kineret) has been shown effective for FCAS, although this does mean daily injections of the immunosuppressant into an area such as the lower abdomen. The monoclonal antibody canakinumab (Ilaris) is also used.

== Signs and symptoms ==
When the body is exposed to the cold in individuals affected by the condition, hives appear and the skin in the affected area typically becomes itchy. Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis. They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid. The border of a hive is described as polycyclic, or made up of many circles, and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed. Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch (turn pale as blood flow is interrupted), distinguishing it from a bruise or papule.

Hives may appear immediately or after a delay. Hives can last for a few minutes or a few days, and vary from person to person. Also, a burning sensation occurs. A serious reaction is most likely to occur for patients where the hives occur with less than three minutes of exposure (during a cold test).

== Cause ==
The hives are a histamine reaction in response to cold stimuli, including a drastic drop in temperature, cold air, and cold water. There are many causes for cold hives, most are idiopathic (meaning they have no known cause). Some rare conditions can cause cold hives, and it can be useful to test for these conditions if the cold hives are in any way unusual.

Scientists from the USA National Institutes of Health have identified a genetic mutation in three unrelated families that causes a rare immune disorder characterized by excessive and impaired immune function: immune deficiency, autoimmunity, inflammatory skin disorders and cold-induced hives (cold urticaria).
== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is typically obtained by an allergist or other licensed practitioner performing a cold test. During the cold test, a piece of ice is placed inside a thin plastic bag and held against the forearm, typically for 3–4 minutes. A positive result is a specific looking mark of raised red hives. The hives may be the shape of the ice, or it may radiate from the contact area of the ice. However, while these techniques assist in diagnosis, they do not provide information about temperature and stimulation time thresholds at which patients will start to develop symptoms, which is essential because it can establish disease severity and monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

== Management ==
Management largely consists of avoiding exposures that could trigger a reaction and taking medicine to manage the reaction. The best treatment for this allergy is avoiding exposure to cold temperatures.

=== Avoiding triggers ===
Anything that lowers the skin temperature (not body&#x27;s core temperature) can trigger a reaction in affected people. Avoiding exposures limits the risk of a reaction. The reaction usually affects the body parts that are exposed, so cold air could trigger a reaction to exposed skin or in the breathing passages if cold air is inhaled. Risky exposures include:
* Situations:
** Cold weather, including snow: Exposure to cold or cool air can quickly trigger a reaction; for example walking by the open freezer cases in a supermarket.
** Air conditioning: Entering a cool building during a summer day can result in a reaction. 
** Cool/cold surfaces: Sitting on sidewalks which are cool, leaning on or grabbing a cold pole can result in hives forming on the area which had contact with the cool surfaces.
** Cold IV lines: Sometimes IV lines are cold, which can result in a reaction. A line of hives may appear within from the IV site in the pattern of a line going up the limb.
* Activities:
** Cold foods and drinks: Eating or drinking cold or cool substances such as ice cream or iced tea may result in a reaction inside the mouth and throat.
** Swimming: Swimming can be especially dangerous, as the rapid heart rate combined with the onset of hives can lead to hypotension, shock, and drowning.
** Sweat: A reaction may even occur on a warm day or coming out of a sauna when there is sweat on the skin, since the reaction is triggered by skin temperature, not core temperature. If there is a breeze, it will rapidly cool the skin and create hives.
** Restriction of blood flow: Activities which cause tense muscles and reduce blood flow can cool the body parts enough to trigger itching and hives.

=== Drugs ===
The first-line therapy is symptomatic relief with second-generation H1-antihistamines. If standard dosing is ineffective, increasing dosages up to fourfold is recommended to control symptoms.

The second-generation H1-antihistamine rupatadine was found to significantly reduce the development of chronic cold urticaria symptom without an increase in adverse effects at doses of and .

Allergy medications containing antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), cyproheptadine (Periactin), and fexofenadine (Allegra) may be taken orally to prevent and relieve some of the hives. For those who have severe anaphylactic reactions, a prescribed medicine such as doxepin, taken daily, should help to prevent and/or lessen the likelihood of a reaction and thus, anaphylaxis. The effectiveness of topical antihistamine creams against hives induced by cold temperature has not been evaluated.

Cold hives can result in a potentially serious or even fatal systemic reaction (anaphylactic shock). People with cold hives may have to carry an injectable form of epinephrine (like Epi-pen or Twinject) for use in the event of a serious reaction.

Studies have found that omalizumab (Xolair) may be an effective and safe treatment for cold urticaria in patients who do not sufficiently respond to standard treatments.

Ebastine has been proposed as an approach to prevent acquired cold urticaria.

<text>Richard Gary Stewart (born March 23, 1938) is a former Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and briefly served as a cabinet minister under Mike Harris.

==Background==
Stewart was educated at Banting Institute, receiving a Mortician Certificate, and worked for a time at Comstock Funeral Home in Peterborough. In 1974, he became president of G. Stewart Travel Services in Peterborough, which he continued to operate throughout his political career. He also served as a director of the Peterborough Civic Hospital.

==Politics==
Stewart became deputy reeve of the Township of Otonabee in 1985 and was a warden of Peterborough County from 1992 to 1994.

He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Sylvia Sutherland and incumbent New Democrat Jenny Carter by a significant margin. He was a backbench supporter of Mike Harris for the next four years.

In the provincial election of 1999, Stewart was elected over Liberal Jeff Leal by about 2,500 votes. He served as chief government whip and minister without portfolio from July 31, 2001 to April 14, 2002. When Ernie Eves became premier in 2002, he was dropped from cabinet. In 2003, Stewart recommended that provincial governments stop enforcing the federal gun registry.

In the 2003 provincial election, Stewart lost to Leal by over 6,000 votes in a rematch from 1999.

Gary’s son Scott Stewart lost to Leal in the general election of 2014.

<text>Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Lachman (born 1970) is an American heavy metal guitarist and vocalist, best known as the lead vocalist of Damageplan. He has also played guitar for Halford, Killswitch Engage, The Mercy Clinic and Burn It All. He currently performs with Diesel Machine.

==Biography==

Portland, Oregon native Lachman started playing guitar at age 12. He was a short-lived member of Dr. Mastermind, featuring former Wild Dogs vocalist Matt McCourt, before joining his brother, vocalist Tim Lachman, in another local band, Gargoyle, in 1988. Gargoyle would move to Los Angeles in 1990 where the band morphed into State of the Art, recording an acclaimed three-song demo before disbanding in 1993. The Lachman brothers next hooked up with Canada native Shane Gaalaas, then the drummer for Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, and recorded another demo under the name Eleventh Hour. In 1996, Lachman and Gaalaas teamed up with former Last Rites and World in Pain members A.J. Cavalier (later to join SOiL) and Jeff Mohr to form Diesel and cut a six-song demo. Parting ways with Mohr and adding Rich Gonzales, formerly with Recipients of Death, on bass, the band would change their name to Diesel Machine in time for the release of their debut album, &quot;Torture Test&quot;, in 2000. By then, Lachman had already been picked as one of the guitar players for Halford, the solo band of Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford.

With Halford, Lachman co-wrote and recorded &quot;Resurrection&quot; (2000), &quot;Live Insurrection&quot; (2001), and another studio album, &quot;Crucible&quot; (2002). He also collaborated with Tommy Victor of Prong on the song &quot;Initiation&quot; which appeared on the band&#x27;s 2002 &quot;100% Live&quot; album and was re-recorded as &quot;Embrace the Depth&quot; for &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;. 2003 saw the release of a Halford EP titled &quot;Fourging the Furnace&quot;, released in Japan only. 

Lachman had already left the Halford band in November 2002 to join former Pantera guitarist &quot;Dimebag Darrell&quot; Abbott and his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott, in a new band called Damageplan as their vocalist. Their debut album, &quot;New Found Power&quot;, was released in 2004; in addition, the song &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, featuring Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, appeared on &quot;The Punisher&quot; soundtrack. The band had recorded several songs for a second album, however, on December 8, 2004, during a Damageplan show at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, Darrell was fatally shot on stage by 25-year-old mentally ill ex-Marine Nathan Gale, who was shot and killed by police minutes later.

After the untimely demise of Damageplan, Lachman put together a new band called The Mercy Clinic in 2005 with guitarists Brian Harrah (Professional Murder Music) and Josh Stinson (Drist), bassist Steed Najera (Triple Seven), and drummer Bevan Davies (Danzig, Comes with the Fall, Jerry Cantrell). Over the course of the next couple of years, the group would write and demo upwards of 20 songs and played frequent shows in the Los Angeles area but ultimately failed to land a record deal. Subsequently, the project was put on hold. On In February 2005, Lachman performed with the surviving members of Alice in Chains at a benefit for tsunami relief in Seattle, Washington, filling in for their late lead singer Layne Staley, along with fellow singers Maynard James Keenan (Tool), Wes Scantlin (Puddle of Mudd), and Ann Wilson (Heart).

Lachman filled in for Killswitch Engage&#x27;s guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz on the band&#x27;s North American tour in early 2007. He also filled in for Dutkiewicz at Download Festival 2007.
In 2008, Lachman began working with Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers formerly of Fear Factory under the name Burn It All. 

On April 1, 2019, Lachman and Diesel Machine released &quot;Shut It&quot;, their first new song in nearly two decades, and announced a tentative fall 2019 release for their long in the works sophomore album, &quot;Evolve&quot;. The album was finally released on August 21, 2020, through German company Metalville. 

On April 30, 2021, Cosmosquad &amp; The Jasonauts released a digital single of &quot;A Jam For Jason MMXXI&quot; on Bandcamp to raise funds for ALS stricken musician Jason Becker, with Lachman contributing lead guitars alongside Jeff Kollman, Chris Poland, Vinnie Moore, and Steve Morse. Lachman had recorded his parts 20 years earlier but this particular version of the track was never released and had only recently been re-discovered.

<text>Stingray Radio Inc. is a Canadian radio broadcasting conglomerate owned by Stingray Group. It owns and operates 101 radio stations in Canada, making it the largest radio conglomerate in Canada. It also owns two television stations in Lloydminster. The majority of its stations are situated in Atlantic and Western Canada, with its largest presences being in the provinces of Alberta and Newfoundland. 

The company was founded in 1986 by Harold R. Steele as Newfoundland Capital Corporation Ltd. based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, later operating under the names Newcap Broadcasting and Newcap Radio. In October 2018, Newcap was acquired by Stingray. As a result of the acquisition, the Steele family became Stingray Group&#x27;s largest third-party shareholder.

==History==

The company dates back to 1980. The group&#x27;s Newfoundland and Labrador division, known as Steele Communications, included all but two of the full-power commercial stations in that province. In the past, Newfoundland Capital acted as a conglomerate with interests in diverse industries such as newspapers and freight transportation. The firm owns one asset unrelated to the broadcasting industry: a hotel in Corner Brook, the Glynmill Inn, which is operated as part of the Steele Hotels group which includes other properties held directly by the Steele family. The Steele family also has private holdings in other industries which are entirely outside of the Newcap corporate umbrella.

In 1986, NCCL received CRTC approval to acquire its first radio station, CHTN in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, from Northumberland Broadcasting Ltd. By 2008, Newcap would own over 70 radio stations, and flipped many radio stations from the AM band to the FM band.

In July 2008, Newcap announced a deal to trade CFDR in Halifax to Rogers Media in exchange for CIGM in Sudbury. Both stations were the sole remaining AM stations in their respective markets, and in both cases the current owner already had the maximum permitted number of FM stations in the applicable market, whereas the acquirer only had a single FM station. Both companies successfully applied to move the stations to FM as part of the trade. Newcap flipped CIGM Sudbury to FM on August 25, 2009, and Rogers flipped CFDR Halifax to FM on August 7, 2009.

On July 28, 2008, Newcap announced that it had a tentative deal to acquire 12 stations in Ontario from Haliburton Broadcasting Group, subject to CRTC approval, for $18.95 million. The company&#x27;s application to acquire the Haliburton stations was formally published by the CRTC on November 13, 2008, but was subsequently withdrawn in January 2009. Newcap CEO Rob Steele indicated that in light of the credit market crisis, the company did not feel that it was the right time to increase its debt load.

In May 2011, Newcap announced that it was selling its two stations in Winnipeg, CKJS and CHNK-FM, to Evanov Communications; the sale was approved on October 24, 2011.

In January 2013, the company announced it was exploring a possible sale of its remaining broadcasting assets in Western Canada, consisting of 32 radio stations and two television stations, and six rebroadcasters associated with those stations. These stations are predominantly in Alberta (including several stations in the Lloydminster region on the Alberta/Saskatchewan border), except for two stations in British Columbia. The company announced in May 2013 it was no longer planning to sell its assets in Western Canada. If such a sale had occurred, Newcap suggested that the proceeds might be used to either fund acquisitions &quot;closer to [Newcap&#x27;s] base in Atlantic Canada&quot;, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders.

On August 26, 2013, Newcap Radio announced it would acquire four former Astral Media radio stations in Toronto and Vancouver, including CHBM-FM, CKZZ-FM, CHHR-FM and CISL, along with Bell Media&#x27;s CFXJ-FM, for $112 million. The deal was made in the wake of Bell Media&#x27;s acquisition of Astral. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 19, 2014 and the sale closed on March 31, 2014.

On April 25, 2017, Rogers Media announced its intent to acquire CISL from Newcap, who relaunched it as a Sportsnet Radio sports talk station with rights to the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks.

On May 11, 2017, Newcap Radio announced its purchase of NL Broadcasting in Kamloops and its three stations, CHNL, CKRV-FM, and CJKC-FM.

On May 2, 2018, cable radio broadcaster Stingray Digital announced its intent to acquire Newcap Radio for $506 million. On October 23, 2018, the CRTC approved Stingray&#x27;s application to acquire Newcap. The sale was completed just days later on October 26, 2018, with the Steele family holding the largest stake in the company besides its founders.

In 2019, Stingray began a broader strategy of networking programs, such as morning shows, across regional groups of stations. This began with the syndication of CKGY-FM/Red Deer&#x27;s &quot;Vinnie &amp; Randi&quot; morning show across various country and adult hits stations in rural Alberta, the midday show &quot;The Paul McGuire&quot; &quot;Show&quot; across Stingray country stations, and the CIGV-FM/Penticton morning show (featuring former CMT personality Casey Clarke) across Stingray&#x27;s country stations in the British Columbia Interior. The morning shows are customized with contributions from a local host. In January 2021, Stingray networked its rock stations in Atlantic Canada out of CFRQ-FM/Halifax, with all of them adopting similar &quot;Q&quot; branding and airing CFRQ&#x27;s morning show, in addition to the existing networked evening show &quot;Rock of the Atlantic&quot;. 

In late-March 2021, the company underwent a restructuring of some of its staff and local program directors, which resulted in layoffs. On April 5, 2021, Stingray launched &quot;The Morning Breeze with Brad &amp; Deb&quot; for its &quot;The Breeze&quot; branded soft adult contemporary stations&quot;,&quot; which is networked out of CKUL-FM/Halifax and incorporates local inserts. Stingray also introduced the networked evening program &quot;Rock of the West&quot; (modelled after &quot;Rock of the Atlantic&quot;), which is hosted by Travis Currah of CIZZ-FM/Red Deer.

In June 2023, Stingray Radio&#x27;s stations joined Bell Media&#x27;s iHeartRadio Canada service; it will still participate in Radioplayer Canada.

<text>Kristen Marie Pfaff (née Parco; May 26, 1967 – June 16, 1994) was an American musician, best known as the bassist for alternative rock band Hole from 1993 to 1994. Prior to Hole, Pfaff was the bassist and backing vocalist for Minneapolis-based band Janitor Joe. Pfaff returned to Janitor Joe for a short tour in the weeks before her death in June 1994 of a heroin overdose.

==Early life and career==
Pfaff was born to Janet Pfaff and her first husband, Mike Parco, in Buffalo, New York. Her birth father comes from a family of several highly successful musicians. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried to Norman Pfaff, who adopted Kristen and gave her his surname. She had one younger brother, Jason, a musician. She studied classical piano and cello.

After graduating from Catholic school Buffalo Academy of the Sacred Heart in 1985, Pfaff spent a short time in Europe and briefly attended Boston College before ultimately finishing at the University of Minnesota, majoring in women&#x27;s studies. There, she also worked as a counselor for rape victims. She was a part of Restore of the Sexual Violence Program, which offered a crisis line, counseling services and training in self-defense programs. Pfaff also took part in the annual 24 Hour Rape Free Zone in 1990, and was quoted as saying the goal was &quot;to draw attention to violence brought against women on campus and in the world&quot;. During this time, she participated in the college radio station, Radio K, and she can be heard doing this in a short clip available on Soundcloud.

While living in Minneapolis, Minnesota following her graduation, Pfaff taught herself to play bass guitar. Pfaff, guitarist/vocalist Joachim Breuer (formerly of Minneapolis band &quot;The Bastards&quot;) and drummer Matt Entsminger formed the band Janitor Joe in 1991.

===Janitor Joe===
The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hmong&quot;, was released in 1992.
Later that year, they released the &quot;Bullethead&quot; single on picture disc, which was followed in 1993 with the &quot;Boyfriend&quot; 7-inch and Janitor Joe&#x27;s debut album &quot;Big Metal Birds&quot;. One Janitor Joe track, &quot;Under The Knife&quot;, can also be found on an OXO records 4-track EP, released in 1993.

Janitor Joe were becoming a staple of the Minneapolis sound, influenced by the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s early grunge sound and by the sharper, faster DC post-hardcore scene, as well as the stop-start distortion of the Butthole Surfers, Big Black and others on the Touch and Go label. Pfaff&#x27;s playing style was central to Janitor Joe&#x27;s relentless assault both live and on record, and she and Breuer both contributed songs to &quot;Big Metal Birds&quot;: &quot;Both operate within easy reach of the line separating punishment and reward - Pfaff&#x27;s contributions (the surly &quot;Boys in Blue&quot;) tend to be slightly more spacious, while Breuer&#x27;s (&quot;One Eye,&quot; for instance) stipulate that drummer Matt Entsminger maintain perpetual motion&quot;, wrote David Sprague of &quot;Trouser Press&quot;.

The growing Minneapolis scene was beginning to attract music press attention in 1993. Amphetamine Reptile released a tour single, &quot;Stinker&quot;, and Janitor Joe began to tour nationally. It was on one such tour in California that year that Pfaff was scouted by Eric Erlandson and Courtney Love of Hole, who were at the time looking for a new bassist. Love invited Pfaff to play with Hole; Pfaff declined and returned to Minneapolis, but Erlandson and Love continued to pursue her.

===Hole===
Pfaff, initially reluctant to leave Minneapolis and join Hole, reconsidered after advice from her father, Norman: &quot;From a professional point of view, there was no decision&quot;, he later told &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;, &quot;because they are already on Geffen Records and already have this huge following in England... if you&#x27;re wanting to move up the ladder, that&#x27;s the way to go&quot;, although Kristen&#x27;s mother Janet was more reluctant for her daughter to leave Minneapolis and Janitor Joe in favor of Seattle and Hole. Following international critical acclaim for their first, independent album, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, Hole had generated a great deal of major-label interest, eventually signing an eight-album deal with Geffen Records for a reported $3 million.

In 1993, Pfaff moved to Seattle, Washington, to work with the other members of Hole on &quot;Live Through This&quot;, the major-label follow-up to &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;. The band&#x27;s new line-up – Love, Erlandson, Pfaff and Patty Schemel on drums – entered the studio in early 1993 to begin rehearsals. &quot;That&#x27;s when we took off,&quot; Eric Erlandson said of Pfaff joining. &quot;All of a sudden, we became a real band.&quot;

==Later years ==
Pfaff&#x27;s time in Seattle was a creatively rich period, and she formed close friendships with Eric Erlandson and Kurt Cobain. While working on the platinum selling album &quot;Live Through This&quot;, Pfaff and Erlandson dated, and stayed together for most of 1993, remaining close even after splitting up. All was not well, however; while living in Washington&#x27;s &#x27;heroin capital&#x27;, Pfaff developed a problem with drug use. &quot;Everybody was doing it. Everyone, everyone. All our friends were junkies. It was ridiculous. Everybody in this town did dope&quot;, said Love of this period in the Seattle music scene. By most accounts, Pfaff&#x27;s own drug use was relatively moderate: &quot;Kristen...dabbled in drugs before she was in our band, in Minneapolis, but it was very light&quot;, Erlandson told Craig Marks of &quot;Spin&quot;. &quot;She moved to Seattle and felt disconnected from everything, and she made friends, drug connections, which I told her not to do. The only way you can survive in this town is if you don&#x27;t make those connections.&quot; After the critical acclaim of Hole&#x27;s &quot;Live Through This&quot; album, Pfaff decided to move back to Minnesota, partly because of her drug problem and partly because of creative differences within Hole.
Pfaff entered a Minneapolis detox center for heroin addiction in February 1994
and left Hole later that spring, to tour with Janitor Joe. &quot;She went on tour... and when she came back from that, she was clean&quot;, says Erlandson. In the wake of Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994, Pfaff decided to leave Hole, and return to Minneapolis permanently. After her tour with Janitor Joe, however, Pfaff made plans to return to Seattle in order to retrieve the rest of her belongings, making the trip to Seattle on June 14, 1994.

==Death==
On June 16, 1994, at around 9:30 a.m., Pfaff was found dead in her Seattle apartment by Paul Erickson, a friend with whom she had planned to leave for Minneapolis that day. She was 27 years old. On the floor was a bag containing syringes and drug paraphernalia. Pfaff&#x27;s death was attributed to &quot;acute opiate intoxication&quot;. She died two months after Kurt Cobain, who was a close friend as well as the husband of Hole&#x27;s frontwoman Courtney Love.

Her father, Norman Pfaff, described her as &quot;bright, personable, wonderful...very, very talented, smart, and she always seemed to be in control of her circumstances. Last night she wasn&#x27;t.&quot; In the book &quot;Love &amp; Death&quot;, released April 2004, Kristen Pfaff&#x27;s mother, Janet Pfaff, states she has never accepted the official story regarding her daughter&#x27;s death. Janet was interviewed by authors Wallace and Halperin in August 2003.

Eric Erlandson, the last person to see Pfaff alive before she overdosed on heroin, later said: &quot;I admit, I made some stupid mistakes with some people, and people are dead because of my stupid mistakes. That&#x27;s what I want to say. And I want to use that so that other people don&#x27;t make the same mistakes that I made, and other people start understanding. I get emotional about this. We&#x27;ve all lost people.&quot;

==Posthumous acknowledgements==
After a period of mourning, Hole recruited bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and dedicated their first show of an extensive touring period to Pfaff. Hole&#x27;s 1997 retrospective compilation &quot;My Body, the Hand Grenade&quot; is also dedicated to her.

On October 20, 1994, Janet Pfaff, Kristen&#x27;s mother, accepted induction on her daughter&#x27;s behalf into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame. &quot;I&#x27;m proud to accept this award for Kristen and I know she would be happy to receive it,&quot; Mrs. Pfaff said. &quot;It&#x27;s sad because Kristen wasn&#x27;t here herself to enjoy the moment. You work so hard in the business to make it at the national level, and that&#x27;s what Kristen did. I just wish she was here to enjoy it, and see how her hometown feels about her.&quot;
A local Minneapolis radio station, University of Minnesota&#x27;s KUOM, started a yearly $1,000 Memorial Scholarship in her name. The award is earmarked for &quot;individuals active in the arts in the pursuit of their educational goals.&quot; Portions from the proceeds of Hole&#x27;s album sales have gone to the Kristen Pfaff Memorial Fund.

English author Guy Mankowski wrote with Jason Pfaff a biography focusing on her life and her work as an activist, counsellor and musician (drawing from her personal archive) which was the basis of a TEDx talk &#x27;Lived Through This: Kristen Pfaff&#x27;s hidden archive and influence&#x27;. 

In November 2024 a &#x27;long awaited&#x27; first volume of a biography about Pfaff was released for subscribers via Substack. John Robb (musician) said, ‘This book ultimately places Kristen back in the deserved centre of the narrative.’

<doc id="1261720" wikidata="Q179148" url="?curid=1261720" title="Buckongahelas">
<text>Buckongahelas ( – May 1805) together with Little Turtle and Blue Jacket, achieved the greatest victory won by Native Americans, killing 600. He was a regionally and nationally renowned Lenape chief, councilor and warrior. He was active from the days of the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) through the Northwest Indian Wars, after the United States achieved independence and settlers encroached on territory beyond the Appalachian Mountains and Ohio River. The chief led his Lenape band from present-day Delaware westward, eventually to the White River area, founding Muncie, Indiana.

==Early life and education==
Buckongahelas was born in present-day Delaware around the year 1720 to Lenape parents. The British colonists called the people the Delaware, after the river, which was the heart of their territory. The Algonquian-speaking Lenape lived throughout the mid-Atlantic area. &quot;Buckongahelas&quot; in the Lenape language means a &quot;Giver of Presents.&quot; He was also known as &quot;Pachgantschihilas&quot; and &quot;Petchnanalas,&quot; meaning a &quot;fulfiller&quot; or &quot;one who succeeds in all he undertakes.&quot;

==Marriage and family==
Buckongahelas married as a young man and started his family. Under pressure from colonial settlers, he began to move his band westward. He was believed to have lived some time with his people in what is now Buckhannon in Upshur County, West Virginia.

His son Mahonegon was killed there in June 1773 by Captain William White, a native of Frederick County, Virginia. Local legend states that the current Upshur County Courthouse was built over the grave of Mahonegon.
Local legend suggests Buckongahelas took revenge on White after trailing his son&#x27;s killer for a period of nine years (1773–1782). The captain was killed March 8, 1782 within sight of Bush Fort in the vicinity of the Buckhannon River. But, historic documentation places Buckongahelas in Ohio by 1781, as he was moving his band west to escape European-American encroachment.

==American Revolutionary War==
During the American Revolutionary War, Buckongahelas led his followers against the Continentals. He broke away from the neutral and pro-American Lenape led by White Eyes. He took his band west to establish a town near the war chief Blue Jacket of the Shawnee. The two men became close allies.

During the war years, a number of Lenape who had converted to Christianity were living in frontier villages run by Moravian missionaries. In April 1781, at the Ohio village of Gnadenhütten, Buckongahelas warned the Lenape that an American militia from Pennsylvania was likely to execute any Indians in their path and would not pay attention to their Christian pacifism. He urged the pacifists to follow him further west away from the encroaching Americans. Moving westward &quot;from the rising sun,&quot; the people could live where the land was good and his warriors would protect them. The Christian Lenape did not heed his words.

John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary, wrote in his account that Buckongahelas&#x27; oration to the Christian Indians was told &quot;with ease and an eloquence not to be imitated.&quot; He continued, &quot;Eleven months after this speech was delivered by this prophetic chief, ninety-six of these same Christian Indians, about sixty of them women and children, were murdered at the place where these very words had been spoken, by the same men he had alluded to, and in the same manner that he had described.&quot; On March 8, 1782, state militia attacked and killed the Lenape in what is known as the Gnadenhütten massacre.

==Post-war tensions==
In the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the Revolutionary War, the British ceded Indian lands in the Ohio Country that were not theirs to the United States. In the late 1780s, Buckongahelas joined a Shawnee-led confederacy to try to repel the American settlers who had begun migrating west of the Appalachian Mountains, using the Ohio River to penetrate the territory.

They won several battles against the Americans in the Northwest Indian Wars, with British support. Buckongahelas led his warriors to win the most devastating military victory ever achieved by Native Americans in the United States, in 1791 against General Arthur St. Clair, who lost 600 troops. The Lenape described Buckongahelas as their own George Washington. Standing 5 feet, 10 inches tall, he was strong with powerful muscles and was said to resemble the statesman Benjamin Franklin.

The Indian confederacy was finally defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The British failed to support the Indian confederacy after this battle, and Buckongahelas signed the Treaty of Greenville on August 3, 1795. By this treaty, his band and other Lenape ceded much land in Pennsylvania and Ohio to the United States. At times, competing tribes tried to control the lands and villages, and it was not clear that the chiefs who signed the treaties had authority over the lands they were ceding.

On June 7, 1803, Buckongahelas signed the Treaty of Fort Wayne in Indiana; the US set new boundaries for the Lenape and other nations. They also ceded salt springs. Algonquian tribes ceded large land tracts to the United States. Lastly, he signed the Treaty of Vincennes on August 18, 1804, in Vincennes, Indiana. The Lenape ceded lands between the Ohio and Wabash rivers. The treaty helped open the Ohio and Indiana territories to European-American settlement. Not able to read and write, Buckongahelas made &quot;X&quot; signatures on the three treaties.

Buckongahelas spent his final years living with his people on the White River near present-day Muncie, Indiana. He died in May 1805 at the age of 85 from smallpox or influenza.

Many local Native Americans thought the epidemics of fatal illnesses to be related to witchcraft, as their traditional remedies and medicine men had no effect on the course of the diseases. They conducted a witch-hunt and executed several Lenape suspected of witchcraft. The conditions of defeat and despair were the grounds for the rise of the Shawnee prophet &quot;Tenskwatawa,&quot; who promised renewed power for the American Indians against the European Americans. His brother Tecumseh became an influential chief leading a new Indian confederacy against the Americans in the early 19th century.

==Legacy and honors==
* Chief Buckongahelas&#x27; loss of his son Mahonegon was memorialized in a 650-pound bronze statue installed in Buckhannon&#x27;s Jawbone Run Park, because settlers admired his alliance with British colonists during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The statue depicts the chief cradling the body of his son. Ross Straight of Buckhannon, WV created the sculpture.

==Popular culture references==
* The killing of the chief&#x27;s son was represented in the historical romance novel &quot;The Scout of the Buckongehanon&quot; (1927), written by John Camillus McWhorter (1866–1937), a judge in Buckhannon.

<text>Brian Stephen Giles (born January 20, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. During his career he played for the Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres. The left-handed Giles was a two-time All-Star and had a career line of .291/.400/.502 with 287 home runs, 411 doubles, 1,078 runs batted in (RBI), and 1,183 walks in 1,847 games.

His younger brother, Marcus Giles, is a former Major League infielder who was most notable for playing with the Atlanta Braves organization. Marcus and Brian played together on the 2007 San Diego Padres.

==Professional career==

===Cleveland Indians===
Giles was born in El Cajon, California, and attended Granite Hills High School. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 17th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. By 1994, Giles had worked his way up to Triple-A, where he batted .313 for Charlotte making the International League All-Star team. In 1995, Giles was again in Triple-A, where he batted .310 for Buffalo and made his major league debut as a September callup on September 16 (where he would bat .556 in nine at-bats with the Indians). He was also an American Association All-Star. Giles hit .355 in 51 games for the Indians in 1996 and hit .314 in 83 games with Buffalo, again making the American Association All-Star team. In 1997, Giles established himself as a major league regular, playing 130 games for the Indians and 112 games in 1998.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On November 18, 1998, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitcher Ricardo Rincón.

In 1999 with the Pirates, Giles emerged as a power-hitting outfielder who also hit for average and showed plate discipline. He began a streak of hitting at least 35 home runs for four straight seasons, during which he batted no lower than .298 and was named Pittsburgh Pirates Player of the Year each year.

Giles led the 2000 club in doubles, triples, home runs, RBIs and walks. His 123 RBIs were eight shy of Paul Waner&#x27;s club record of 131 set in 1927. He became the first Pirate ever to hit at least .300 with 30 plus home runs and 100 plus RBIs in back-to-back seasons, he became the third player in club history with 100 runs, 100 RBIs and 100 walks in the same season, after Barry Bonds in 1992 and Ralph Kiner from 1948–51. His 114 walks were the most by a Pirate since 1992, Bonds drew 127 walks. Giles&#x27; 74 home runs in two seasons with the club represent the most in back-to-back seasons since Willie Stargell hit 77 in 1972–73. He was named National League Player-of-the-Week after hitting .400 with two doubles, three home runs and 12 RBIs between May 2 and May 7 and shared player of the week honors with Colorado&#x27;s Todd Helton after hitting .523 with three doubles, one triple, three home runs, eight RBIs and six runs scored between August 12 and August 20. Giles was named to the All-Star team for the first time in his career. He finished ninth in voting among National League outfielders.

In 2001 Giles established career highs in games played, at bats, runs and hits. He tied career highs in doubles, triples and stolen bases. At the end of the season he ranked tenth among NL players in runs (116), on-base percentage (.404), and slugging percentage (.590). His runs total was the highest by a Pirate since Ralph Kiner in 1951. He led the Pirates in batting, home runs and walks. He tied Dave Parker&#x27;s club record for most total bases, 340, by a left-handed hitter. Giles hit his 100th career home run as a member of the Pirates on August 9; he is one of 17 players to homer 100 times as a Pirate. He was selected to play in the All-Star Game for the second consecutive year.

In 2002, Giles drew a career-high 135 walks, ranking him second in the National League behind San Francisco&#x27;s Barry Bonds, who led with 198. He also established the club record for most base on balls in a season by a left-handed batter. His .450 on-base percentage tied him for the second-best mark in the majors, he also ranked second in the league in slugging percentage with .622, sixth in home runs, second with 80 extra-base hits ranked second behind San Francisco&#x27;s Jeff Kent, tied for second in the league with 13 outfield assists and also finished third in the NL with 24 intentional walks. He homered once every 13.1 at bats, the third-best ratio in the league behind Bonds&#x27; 8.8 and Sammy Sosa&#x27;s 11.3.

===San Diego Padres===

On August 26, 2003, he was traded to his hometown San Diego Padres for Jason Bay, Óliver Pérez, and minor leaguer Corey Stewart.

Giles continued to be a patient and reliable hitter in San Diego, leading the majors with 119 walks in 2005. From 2004–2006, Giles played in over 150 games each season for the Padres, but in 2006, his batting average dropped to a career-low .263. On May 14, 2006, he drew five walks in a game, one shy of the record of six. In 2007, joined by his brother Marcus, signed as a free agent to be the starting second baseman, Giles batted .271, but missed time with an injured knee.

In 2008, Giles, in the third and final guaranteed year of his contract with the Padres, vetoed a potential trade to Boston, citing a desire to remain close to his family. In 2008, 58% of his strikeouts were &quot;looking&quot;, by far the highest percentage in the major leagues.

In 2009, through July 1 Giles had the lowest batting average (.191), slugging percentage (.271), and OPS (.548) in the major leagues. However, he went on the disabled list soon afterward with an arthritic right knee and missed the rest of the season.

===Retirement===
On February 7, 2010, Giles signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and received an invitation to spring training. However, after playing in just two spring training games as a designated hitter, he announced his retirement on March 11, 2010.

==Domestic abuse==
Giles was sued by his former girlfriend for more than $10 million. She alleged Giles broke an oral and/or implied agreement that he would take care of her for an indefinite period of time. She alleged Giles began abusing her in 2002, and battered her while she was pregnant with Giles&#x27; child, and caused her to have a miscarriage. She dropped the allegations that Giles caused the miscarriage before the trial began. A jury found that both Giles and his girlfriend, Cheri Olvera, committed acts of domestic violence against each other but that there were no damages. The jury also refused to award damages on Olvera&#x27;s contract claim, finding that Olvera&#x27;s alleged terms were not clear enough so that both Olvera and Giles could understand what each was required to do. Instead, the jury found that Olvera must return the $107,000 engagement ring Giles provided to her or pay the $107,000 as damages. Following Giles&#x27; dispute with Olvera and given the nature of the court case, Giles&#x27; endorsement contract with Nair Hair Removal products was terminated. As of August 22, 2018 the San Diego Padres have cut ties with Brian Giles and his brother Marcus, over domestic violence issues.

<text>Vengaboys ( ) is a Dutch Eurodance music group based in Rotterdam consisting of lead and female vocalist Kim Sasabone, female vocalist Denise van Rijswijk and male vocalists Robin Pors and Donny Latupeirissa. Created by Dutch producers Wessel van Diepen (who selected the group members) and Dennis van den Driesschen (known as Danski and Delmundo), the group enjoyed commercial success in the late 1990s. They are best known for their hit singles &quot;We Like to Party&quot;, &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Ibiza&quot;, the latter two of which topped the UK Singles Chart and have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide. 

On 2 May 2000, the World Music Awards gave Vengaboys the award for best-selling dance group of the year. In 2019, Dutch online newspaper Nu.nl called Vengaboys the most successful Dutch pop group in history.

==History==
===1996–1998: Formation, &quot;Up and Down&quot;, and &quot;The Party Album&quot;===
The name &quot;Vengaboys&quot; was originally the title of the electronic musical project of Dutch producers Danski and Delmundo as DJs in the early 90&#x27;s. In 1997 they decided to use the name to produce a pop group, choosing the Brazilian-Dutch singer Kim Sasabone as the vocal lead. After some auditions, Denise Post-Van Rijswijk, Roy den Burger and Robin Pors were added to complete the group. 

In August 1997, the group released their debut single &quot;Parada de Tettas&quot;, followed by &quot;To Brazil!&quot; in December 1997 and &quot;Up and Down&quot; in February 1998. In April 1998, the group released their debut album &quot;Up &amp; Down - The Party Album&quot; in the Netherlands and Belgium. The album was certified gold in the Netherlands. This was followed by &quot;We Like to Party!&quot; in May, which peaked at number 2 on the Dutch charts and at number 1 in Belgium in June 1998.

In October the group released &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits! Part 1&quot;, the album peaked at number 1 on the Dutch chart.

In November 1998, the Vengaboys entered the UK Singles Chart at number 4 with &quot;Up and Down&quot;. &quot;We Like to Party!&quot; was released internationally in 1999 and was a Top 10 hit in many European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It reached number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

In June 1999, The Vengaboys released &quot;Greatest Hits! Part 1&quot; as &quot;The Party Album&quot;; their debut studio album. The single &quot;Boom Boom Boom Boom&quot; topped the charts in the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands. In November 1999 &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!&quot; was also used in an advert in Japan for Nissan for their Wingroad 5-door estate.

&quot;We&#x27;re Going to Ibiza&quot;, a reworking of Typically Tropical&#x27;s 1975 number 1 hit &quot;Barbados&quot;, also reached the top slot in the Netherlands in September 1999. The LP spent 30 consecutive weeks on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold (500,000 units) in November 1999. 

&quot;The Remix Album&quot; was released in January 2000, featuring new dance remixes of the songs from the Vengaboys&#x27; debut record.

===2000–2002: Departure of Pors, &quot;The Platinum Album&quot; and hiatus===
Shortly before the release of their next studio album, Pors left the group to pursue a solo career and was replaced by dolphin trainer Yorick Bakker. 

&quot;The Platinum Album&quot; was released in early 2000, which saw continued success for the group, as its first three singles &quot;Kiss (When the Sun Don&#x27;t Shine)&quot;, &quot;Shalala Lala&quot; and &quot;Uncle John from Jamaica&quot; all charted in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Canada, with the first two going on to top the New Zealand charts. For the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Cheekah Bow Bow (That Computer Song)&quot;, the group gained a virtual member, the animated Cheekah. 

In 2002 Post-Van Rijswijk and Bakker left the group which ceased its activities.

===2007–2009: Return on stage and line-up changes===
In 2007, the group returned to the club scene with new member Donny Latupeirissa a.k.a. Ma&#x27;Donny, replacing den Burger as Cowboy. Post-Van Rijswijk and Bakker rejoined the group at that point. In 2009, Pors also rejoined the group while Bakker left again. 

===2010–2013: &quot;The Best of Vengaboys&quot;===
In 2010, the band released a new single, &quot;Rocket To Uranus&quot;, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Pete Burns and American celebrity Perez Hilton. The video premiered on 6 June at the Dutch television station TMF, and in 2D and 3D formats on their own website and YouTube channel. 

In December 2011, the group released &quot;The Best of Vengaboys&quot; in Australia.
In January 2013, the group first performed a cover of &quot;Hot, Hot, Hot&quot;, during their National Tour in Australia. The song was released in July 2013 as a single. 

Around that time, Kim Sasabone became pregnant.

===2014–2015: &quot;X-mas Party Album&quot;===

In January 2014, Robin Pors said in an interview in Dubai that the group intended to continue touring in Europe and that they were working on future shows in the Middle East and India, along with performing their greatest hits, their latest single, &quot;Hot, Hot, Hot&quot;, and reportedly new unreleased tracks. He also stated that releasing new material was planned for 2014. In May 2014 a new remix from their single &quot;To Brazil&quot; re-titled &quot;2 Brazil&quot; was released. 

In November 2014 a new album was released called &quot;The X-mas Party Album&quot; including all the Vengaboys hits with a Christmas sound. Also, the single &quot;Where Did My X-mas Tree Go&quot; was released together with a new music video. A tour of South Africa was scheduled for December.

===2015–2017: Australia and New Zealand tour===
In late February 2015, Denise Post-Van Rijswijk said that she was pregnant with her second child.

In 2016, the group toured Australia and New Zealand. 

In November and December 2017, Vengaboys supported Steps at their Party on the Dancefloor Tour.

=== 2019: 20th anniversary and &quot;Unplugged&quot; EP ===
In 2019, Vengaboys celebrated their 20th anniversary and released unplugged versions of the songs &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Ibiza!&quot; and released an EP titled &quot;Unplugged #1&#x27;s&quot;.

=== 2020–2021: Covers and re-mixes ===
In the summer of 2020, the band released a festival version of their worldwide hit &quot;Up &amp; Down&quot; with Australian DJ and producer Timmy Trumpet, with the new version credited to Timmy Trumpet x Vengaboys.

In September 2021, the band released a cover version of Charli XCX and Troye Sivan&#x27;s &quot;1999&quot;, retitled &quot;1999 (I Wanna Go Back)&quot; and came with a deep fake-style video which saw the cover stars from various 1990s albums lip-syncing to the song and the band put into the &quot;Friends&quot; title sequence with the sofa and fountain.

In September 2021, the Vengaboys&#x27; took part in &quot;90&#x27;s Nostalgia: Electric Circus&quot; tour in Canada, featuring Eurodance music.

In December 2024, Kim Sasabone announced she was taking a break to rest and would be replaced for the rest of their tour by Cilla Niekoop from Ch!pz.

<doc id="1261733" wikidata="Q5013139" url="?curid=1261733" title="CNN Airport">
<text>CNN Airport was an American out-of-home television network owned and operated by AT&amp;T&#x27;s WarnerMedia through CNN, hence its name. The service broadcast general news, weather, stock market updates, entertainment, and travel content to airports across the United States. The founding management was led by Jon Petrovich and Scott Weiss. Deborah Cooper was the inaugural vice president/general manager.

CNN Airport&#x27;s 24-hour schedule consisted of roughly 16% live news, 19% live sports, 24% lifestyle, 24% travel, and 10% for local inserts from airports if they warrant.

The network discontinued operations on March 31, 2021.

==History==
The network originally was test launched from June 3 to July 14, 1991, at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport and O&#x27;Hare International Airport, and officially debuted on January 20, 1992, as the CNN Airport Network.

CNN Airport was available in 58 airports in the United States. CNN would pay local airport authorities for the exclusive rights to run its programming on monitors throughout their terminals.

Its breakfast and early fringe schedule included news programming from CNN and HLN, broadcast on a 10-second delay. The network also aired air travelers-designed weather, business and travel segments. CNN Airport broadcast 24/7, with around-the-clock technical and editorial staffing, including three of its own reporters. Due to the network&#x27;s prominence in public waiting areas, the network had stricter content standards than the regular CNN; for instance, stories involving commercial aviation incidents and crashes did not appear on the network, and were overlaid with automated weather conditions. Stories that involved sexual content and graphic violence are similarly overlaid. The network&#x27;s digital on-screen graphics were designed larger than industry standards, to allow readability of fonts at a distance. The network also carried sports coverage from Turner Sports properties, along with other sports rights such as the NFL and the Super Bowl from other networks which were contractually bound to only air on airport screens. Commercial breaks instead carried interstitials from other Turner and Time Warner properties, and the ability to break into programming for airport-wide advisory messages.

In 2018, Republican Iowa congressman Steve King accused CNN Airport of having a monopoly on partisan grounds, proposing an unsuccessful amendment to the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 to prohibit a single broadcaster from holding a monopoly over television programming screened at airport terminals. Most American international airports and larger train stations also have shops managed by Paradies Lagardère or other vendors which license the names of other cable networks such as CNBC and Fox News (along with CNN itself) to brand those shops, and likewise screen those channels on the televisions within their premises inexclusive of an airport&#x27;s advertising and screen deals.

On January 12, 2021, CNN&#x27;s president Jeff Zucker announced that CNN Airport would cease operations on March 31; Zucker cited several factors and changes in consumer behavior, including the ubiquity of streaming video on mobile devices, as having made the network&#x27;s purpose outdated.
