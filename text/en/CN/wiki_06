<text>Olympiacos F.C. ( ), known simply as Olympiacos or Olympiacos Piraeus, is a Greek professional football club based in Piraeus. Part of the major multi-sport club Olympiacos CFP (&quot;Olympiakós Sýndesmos Filáthlon Peiraiós&quot;, &quot;Olympic Association of Piraeus Sportsmen&quot;), their name was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and along with the club&#x27;s emblem, the laurel-crowned Olympic athlete, symbolise the Olympic ideals of ancient Greece. Their home ground is the Karaiskakis Stadium, a 33,334-capacity stadium in Piraeus.

Founded on 10 March 1925, Olympiacos is the most successful club in Greek football history, having won 47 league titles, 28 Cups (18 doubles), four Super Cups, all records, and three international titles (the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2023–24, the UEFA Youth League in 2023-24, and the Balkans Cup in 1963). The club has 171 titles (79 national, 27 regional, 37 others, and three international), and as of 2018 was ninth in the world in total titles won by a football club. The club&#x27;s dominating success is further evidenced in that all other Greek clubs have won a combined total of 41 league titles. while Olympiacos also holds the record for the most consecutive Greek League titles won, with seven in a row in two occasions (1997–2003 and 2011–2017), breaking their own previous record of six consecutive wins in the 1950s (1954–1959), when Olympiacos was unequivocally nicknamed Thrylos (, &quot;The Legend&quot;). Having won the 2014–15 League title, Olympiacos became the only football club in the world to have won five or more consecutive championships five times in their history. They are also the only Greek club to have won six consecutive national Cups (1957–1963) as well as six League titles undefeated (1937, 1938, 1948, 1951, 1954, 1955). Olympiacos are one of only three clubs to have never been relegated from the top flight of Greek football, and by winning the 2012–13 title, their 40th in total, they added a fourth star above their crest, each representing 10 league titles.

Internationally, Olympiacos is the only Greek football club in history to have won major European trophies, winning the UEFA Youth League and the UEFA Europa Conference League, both in 2023–24. With their 2024 triumph, they became the first club outside the biggest four European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga and Bundesliga) to win a UEFA competition since 2011, and they added a 5th star above their crest, representing their European victory. They are also the highest ranked Greek club in the UEFA rankings, occupying the 36th place in the ten-year ranking, and the 43rd in the five-year ranking as of 2024. They are one of the founding members of the European Club Association. Olympiacos FC is the only football club to have won two UEFA European titles in the same season.

Olympiacos is the most popular football club in Greece, and gathering strong support from Greek communities all over the world. With 83,000 registered members as of April 2006, the club was ninth in the 2006 list of football clubs with the most paying members in the world, which increased to 98,000 in 2014. Olympiacos share a longstanding rivalry with Panathinaikos, with whom they contest in the &quot;derby of the eternal enemies&quot;, the most classic football derby in Greece and one of the best-known around the world.

== History ==

=== Early years (1925–1931) ===


Olympiacos was founded on 10 March 1925, in the city of Piraeus. The club&#x27;s initial aim, as stated in the statutes, was the systematic cultivation and development of its athletes&#x27; possibilities for participation in athletic competitions, the spreading of the Olympic athletic ideal and the promotion of sportsmanship and fanship among the youth according to egalitarian principles, by stressing a healthy, ethical and social basis as its foundation. Members of &quot;Piraikos Podosfairikos Omilos FC&quot; (Sport and Football Club of Piraeus) and &quot;Piraeus Fans Club FC&quot; decided, during a historical assembly, to dissolve the two clubs in order to establish a new unified one, which would bring this new vision and dynamic to the community. Notis Kamperos, a senior officer of the Hellenic Navy, proposed the name &quot;Olympiacos&quot; and the profile of a laurel-crowned Olympic winner as the emblem of the new club. Michalis Manouskos, a prominent Piraeus industrialist, expanded the name to its complete and current status, &quot;Olympiacos Syndesmos Filathlon Pireos&quot;. Besides Kamperos and Manouskos, among the most notable founding members were Stavros Maragoudakis, the post office director; Nikos Andronikos, a merchant; Dimitrios Sklias, a Hellenic Army officer; Nikolaos Zacharias, an attorney; Athanasios Mermigas, a notary public; Kostas Klidouchakis, who became the first goalkeeper in the club&#x27;s history; Ioannis Kekkes, a stockbroker; and above all, the Andrianopoulos family. Andrianopoulos, a family of well-established Piraeus merchants, played a pivotal role in the founding of Olympiacos. The five brothers, Yiannis, Dinos, Giorgos, Vassilis, and Leonidas Andrianopoulos raised the reputation of the club and brought it to its current glory. Yiannis, Dinos, Giorgos, and Vassilis were the first to play, while Leonidas, the youngest of the five, made his debut later on and played for the club for eight years (1927–1935). The club&#x27;s offensive line, made up of the five brothers, became legendary, rising to a mythical status and soon Olympiacos gained enormous popularity and became the most successful and well-supported club in Greece. Back then, their fan base consisted mainly of the working class, with the team&#x27;s home ground at Neo Phaliron Velodrome, before moving to its current Karaiskakis Stadium. They became Piraeus Champions in 1925 and 1926.

In 1926, the Hellenic Football Federation was founded and organised the Panhellenic Championship in the 1927–1928 season. This was the first national championship, where the regional champions from EPSA league (Athens), EPSP league (Piraeus) and EPSM league (Thessaloniki) competed for the national title during play-offs, with Aris becoming the first champion. The Panhellenic Championship was organised in this manner up until 1958–59. However, in the second season (1928–29) a dispute arose between Olympiacos and the Hellenic Football Federation and as a result, the club did not participate in the championship, with Panathinaikos and AEK Athens deciding to follow Olympiacos. During the course of that season, the three of them played friendly games with each other and formed a group called P.O.K.

Meanwhile, the club continued to dominate the Piraeus Championship, winning the 1926–27, 1928–29, 1929–30 and 1930–31 titles and started establishing themselves as the leading force in Greek football; they set a record by remaining undefeated against all Greek teams for three consecutive seasons (14 March 1926 to 3 March 1929), counting 30 wins and 6 draws in 36 games. Those results ignited an enthusiastic reception from the Greek press, who called Olympiacos &quot;Thrylos&quot; (&quot;Legend&quot;) for the first time in history. The fourth Panhellenic Championship took place in 1930–31 and found Olympiacos winning the Greece national league title for the first time ever, which was a milestone that marked the beginning of a very successful era in Olympiacos history. Olympiacos put in a great performance during the competition and won the title very convincingly with 11 wins, 2 draws and only one game lost. They managed to score 7 wins in 7 matches at home, beating Panathinaikos, AEK Athens, Aris, Iraklis and PAOK with the same score: 3–1. The sole exception was the match against Ethnikos, where Olympiacos netted 4 goals and won with 4–1. Besides the Andrianopoulos brothers and Kostas Klidouchakis, other notable players of the first era in the club&#x27;s history (1925–1931) were Achilleas Grammatikopoulos, Lalis Lekkos, Philippos Kourantis, Nikos Panopoulos, Charalambos Pezonis and Kostas Terezakis.

=== Domination in Greece and World War II (1931–1946) ===

The rise of the new decade marked a substantial rise in Panhellenic Championship&#x27;s popularity throughout Greece. In October 1931, Giorgos and Yiannis Andrianopoulos, emblematic players and founding members of Olympiacos, retired from active football. However, new heroes emerged, such as Giannis Vazos, Christoforos Raggos, Theologos Symeonidis, Michalis Anamateros, Spyros Depountis, Aris Chrysafopoulos, Nikos Grigoratos, Panagis Korsianos as well as the iconic brothers Giannis and Vangelis Chelmis and the club won five Championships in nine seasons (1932–33, 1933–34, 1935–36, 1936–37, 1937–38) and by 1940, Olympiacos had already won six Championships in the eleven first seasons of the Panhellenic Championship. Especially Giannis Vazos, Christoforos Raggos and Theologos Symeonidis composed a formidable trio of attacking players, scoring numerous goals and became nothing short of legendary. Giannis Vazos played for 18 years for Olympiacos (1931–1949), and managed to score 450 goals in 364 games (179 goals in 156 official games) for the club, being the club&#x27;s second all-time scorer, winning also the Greek Championship top scorer award four times (1933, 1936, 1937 and 1947).

In addition, the club managed to win the 1936–37 and 1937–38 Championship titles undefeated. Ιn Greek Cup, the team did not manage to win the competition in its first four editions, despite some outstanding wins such as the record-setting 1–6 away victory against Panathinaikos in Leoforos Stadium in 1932 (V. Andrianopoulos 16&#x27;, 68&#x27;, 88&#x27;, Raggos 24&#x27;, Vazos 69&#x27;, 70&#x27;), which is the biggest away victory in this derby&#x27;s history.

On 28 October 1940, Fascist Italy invaded Greece, and several Olympiacos players joined the Hellenic Army to fight against the Axis invaders. Chistoforos Raggos was heavily injured in his left leg in January 1941, and wasn&#x27;t able to play football again. Leonidas Andrianopoulos suffered severe frostbite in the Albanian front and almost died, while Nikos Grigoratos was injured in the leg during the Battle of Klisura. Furthermore, after the subsequent German occupation of Greece, Olympiacos players joined the Greek Resistance and fought fiercely against the Nazis. Olympiacos player Nikos Godas, an emblematic figure for the club, was captain of the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army (ELAS) and fought against the Germans in many fronts. He was executed wearing Olympiacos shirt and shorts, as was his last wish: &quot;Shoot me and kill me with my Olympiacos shirt on, and do not blindfold me, I want to see the colours of my team before the final shot.&quot; Michalis Anamateros was also an active member of the Greek Resistance and was killed in 1944. Olympiacos paid a heavy price during the destructive war, the Axis occupation and the ensuing Greek Civil War and the club&#x27;s progress was put on temporary hold.

=== The Legend (1946–1959) ===
After the war, Olympiacos saw many of its key-players of the pre-war era retire, with many significant changes being made in the team&#x27;s roster. Olympiacos captain and prolific scorer Giannis Vazos remained in the club, along with Giannis Chelmis. New important players joined the club, such as Andreas Mouratis, Alekos Chatzistavridis, Stelios Kourouklatos and Dionysis Minardos. As soon as regular fixtures recommenced, the Piraeus club returned to their dominant position in Greek football. From 1946 to 1959, Olympiacos won 9 out of the 11 Greek Championships (1947, 1948, 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959), bringing home 15 Championship titles in a total of 23 completed seasons of the Greek League. The six-straight Greek Championships won by Olympiacos from 1954 to 1959 was an unmatched achievement in Greek football history, an all-time record which stood for 44 years, up until Olympiacos managed to win seven-straight Greek Championships from 1997 to 2003.

Furthermore, during the same period (1946–1959), the club won 8 Greek Cups out of 13 editions (1947, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959), thus completing 6 Doubles (1947, 1951, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959), three of which being consecutive (1957–1959). The legendary Olympiacos team of the 1950s, with key performers such as Andreas Mouratis, Ilias Rossidis, Thanasis Bebis, Ilias Yfantis, Babis Kotridis, Kostas Polychroniou, Giorgos Darivas, Babis Drosos, Antonis Poseidon, Savvas Theodoridis, Kostas Karapatis, Mimis Stefanakos, Thanasis Kinley, Stelios Psychos, Giannis Ioannou, Themis Moustaklis, Vasilis Xanthopoulos, Dimitris Kokkinakis, Giorgos Kansos, Kostas Papazoglou and Aristeidis Papazoglou marked Olympiacos&#x27; period of absolute domination in Greek football, which skyrocketed the club&#x27;s popularity and spread the word of Olympiacos&#x27; superiority throughout Greece. Hence, after the club&#x27;s record-breaking performance in the trophy-laden era of the 1950s, the club gained unequivocally the nickname of &quot;Thrylos&quot;, meaning &quot;The Legend&quot;.

On 13 September 1959, Olympiacos made its debut in Europe against Milan for the 1959–60 European Cup and became the first Greek club that ever played in the European competitions. The first leg was held at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus and Olympiacos took the lead with a goal by Kostas Papazoglou (1–0), which was the first goal ever scored by a Greek club (and by a Greek player as well) in the European competitions. Milan&#x27;s prolific goalscorer José Altafini equalised the match with a header in the 33rd minute, after a cross by Giancarlo Danova. Ilias Yfantis scored an outstanding goal and gave Olympiacos the lead again in the 45th minute of the game, when he controlled the ball between Cesare Maldini and Vincenzo Occhetta and unleashed a powerful volley, burying the ball into the back of the net (2–1). Altafini scored his second goal once again with a header (72nd minute), after a free-kick by Nils Liedholm. The match ended 2–2, with Olympiacos putting in a great performance against the Italian champions, despite the fact that they had no foreign players in their roster, while Milan had four world-class foreign players, such as Altafini, Liedholm, Juan Alberto Schiaffino and Ernesto Grillo. In the second leg Milan won 3–1 (Giancarlo Danova 12&#x27;, 26&#x27;, 85&#x27;–Ilias Yfantis 68&#x27;) and qualified for the next round, despite Olympiacos&#x27; good performance especially in the second half.

=== First international success and Márton Bukovi era (1960–1972) ===

Olympiacos entered the 1960s by winning the 1960 and 1961 Greek Cups, thus completing five consecutive Greek Cup wins, which is an all-time record in Greek football history. In this decade, a strong side was created with players from the late 1950s and new important players, such as Giannis Gaitatzis, Nikos Gioutsos, Pavlos Vasileiou, Vasilis Botinos, Giannis Fronimidis, Christos Zanteroglou, Grigoris Aganian, Stathis Tsanaktsis, Mimis Plessas, Giangos Simantiris, Pavlos Grigoriadis, Savvas Papazoglou, Stelios Besis, Sotiris Gavetsos, Tasos Sourounis, Vangelis Milisis, Orestis Pavlidis, Panagiotis Barbalias and last but not least the prolific goalscorer Giorgos Sideris, top-scorer in the club&#x27;s history with 493 goals in 519 matches in all competitions (224 goals in 284 Greek Championship matches).

In 1963, Olympiacos became the first ever Greek club to win a non-domestic competition, winning the Balkans Cup, which marked the first international success by any Greek football club. The Balkans Cup was a very popular international competition in the 1960s (the 1967 final attracted 42.000 spectators), being the second most important international club competition for clubs from the Balkans (after the European Champions&#x27; Cup). Olympiacos topped his group after some notable wins, beating Galatasaray 1–0 at the Karaiskakis Stadium (Stelios Psychos 49&#x27;), as well as FK Sarajevo (3–2) and FC Brașov (1–0), bagging also two away draws against Galatasaray (1–1) in Mithatpaşa Stadium (Metin Oktay 78&#x27; – Aristeidis Papazoglou 6&#x27;) and FK Sarajevo in Koševo Stadium (3–3). In the final, they faced Levski Sofia, winning the first match in Piraeus (1–0, Giorgos Sideris 37&#x27;) and losing the second match in Vasil Levski Stadium with the same score. In the third decisive final in Istanbul (a neutral ground), Olympiacos beat Levski 1–0 in Mithatpaşa Stadium with a goal by Mimis Stefanakos in the 87th minute and won the Balkans Cup.

The club went on to win the 1963 and 1965 Greek Cups, completing seven Greek Cup titles in nine years. However, the years 1959–1965 were not fruitful for Olympiacos in the Greek Championship, as the team was not able to win the title for six years. This mediocre performance led Olympiacos board to hire the legendary Márton Bukovi as the club&#x27;s head coach, with Mihály Lantos (prominent member of the Hungary national team of the 1950s widely known as the &quot;Mighty Magyars&quot; or &quot;Aranycsapat&quot;) as his assistant coach. The innovative Hungarian coach, pioneer of the 4–2–4 formation (along with Béla Guttmann and Gusztáv Sebes) was a solid tactician and favoured attacking football and very demanding training sessions. Bukovi&#x27;s innovatory tactics and groundbreaking training methods transformed Olympiacos and created a powerful, attacking team with constant player movement and solid combination game that often played spectacular football. Under Bukovi&#x27;s guidance and with the great performance of key players such as Giorgos Sideris, Nikos Gioutsos, Kostas Polychroniou, Vasilis Botinos, Aristeidis Papazoglou, Pavlos Vasileiou, Giannis Gaitatzis, Christos Zanteroglou, Grigoris Aganian, Mimis Plessas, Giannis Fronimidis and Orestis Pavlidis, Olympiacos won 2 straight Greek Championships (1966, 1967). They won the 1966 title with 23 wins and 4 draws in 30 games and in the decisive away match against Trikala, an estimated 15,000 ecstatic Olympiacos fans swarmed into the city of Trikala to celebrate the win (0–5) and the Championship title after seven years.

The next season 1966–67, Olympiacos won 12 out of the first 14 games in the league, which was an all-time record in Greek football history, which lasted for 46 years and up until 2013, when Olympiacos, under coach Míchel&#x27;s guidance, broke his own record by winning 13 out of the 14 first matches of the 2013–14 season. They won the title in a convincing way and with some notable wins, like the 4–0 smashing victory against arch-rivals Panathinaikos at the Karaiskakis Stadium (Vasileiou 17&#x27;, Sideris 20&#x27;, 35&#x27;, 62&#x27;), where Olympiacos played spectacular football and missed a plethora of chances for a much bigger score. Bukovi became a legend for the club&#x27;s fans and his creation, the Olympiacos team of 1965–67, became nothing short of legendary. A special anthem was written for Bukovi&#x27;s Olympiacos and became popular throughout Greece: &quot;Του Μπούκοβι την ομαδάρα, τη λένε Ολυμπιακάρα&quot; (&quot;Bukovi&#x27;s mighty team is called Olympiacos&quot;).

Shortly before the end of the 1966–67 season, a military coup d&#x27;état took place and the Colonels seized power in Greece, establishing a dictatorship. The regime of the Colonels had devastating consequences for Olympiacos. In December 1967, Giorgos Andrianopoulos, club legend and president of the club for 13 years (1954–1967) was forced out of the club&#x27;s presidency by the military regime. Furthermore, the regime cancelled the transfer of Giorgos Koudas to Olympiacos and days later another blow was delivered to the club: Márton Bukovi, already a legend and architect of the great 1965–67 team, was forced out of Greece by the military junta, being labelled a communist. He left Greece on 21 December 1967, along with Mihály Lantos.

=== Goulandris era (1972–1975) ===

Another chapter began in 1972, after Nikos Goulandris became president of the club. He reinstated all the prominent members of Olympiacos board that had been forced out by the military regime (including Giorgos Andrianopoulos) and opened-up the member election process, establishing a new, trustworthy board of directors. He appointed Lakis Petropoulos as head coach and signed top-class players, creating a great roster with key performers such as Giorgos Delikaris, Yves Triantafyllos, Julio Losada, Milton Viera, Panagiotis Kelesidis, Michalis Kritikopoulos, Takis Synetopoulos, Romain Argyroudis, Maik Galakos, Nikos Gioutsos, Giannis Gaitatzis, Vasilis Siokos, Thanasis Angelis, Lakis Glezos, Petros Karavitis, Kostas Davourlis, Giannis Kyrastas, Dimitris Persidis, Lefteris Poupakis and Babis Stavropoulos. Under Goulandris&#x27; presidency, Olympiacos won the Greek Championship three times in a row (1972–73, 1973–74, 1974–75), combining it with the Greek Cup in 1973 (beating PAOK 1–0 in the final) and 1975 (beating Panathinaikos 1–0 in the final) to celebrate two Doubles in three years. Ιn the 1972–73 season, Olympiacos won the title by conceding only 13 goals in 34 matches, which is an-all-time record in Greek football history. The team&#x27;s best year though, was undoubtedly the 1973–74 season, when Olympiacos won the league with 26 wins and 7 draws in 34 games, scoring an all-time record of 102 goals and conceding only 14.

In European competitions, they managed to eliminate Cagliari in the 1972–73 UEFA Cup, a major force in Italian football during the late 1960s and the early 1970s, (1970 Serie A Champions, 1972 Serie A title contenders), with world-class Italian international players like Gigi Riva, Angelo Domenghini, Enrico Albertosi, Pierluigi Cera, Sergio Gori and Fabrizio Poletti. Olympiacos managed to beat Cagliari twice, 2–1 in Piraeus and 1–0 in Cagliari, becoming the first ever Greek football club to win on Italian soil. In the next round they faced the competition&#x27;s defending champions Tottenham Hotspur, who were undefeated for 16-straight games in all European competitions. Olympiacos did not manage to qualify against Spurs, but they managed to get a 1–0 win in Piraeus, which ended Tottenham&#x27;s undefeated streak and marked the first ever victory of a Greek football club against an English side. Two years later, Olympiacos entered the 1974–75 European Cup and they were drawn to face Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s Celtic, one of the strongest teams in European football at that time and semi-finalists of the previous season. The first leg was played in Celtic Park, where Celtic had never been defeated, running an undefeated streak of 36 straight home games in all European competitions (27 wins, 9 draws) from 1962 to 1974. Olympiacos took the lead through Milton Viera&#x27;s strike in the 36th minute, with Celtic equalising late in the game. The away draw gave Olympiacos the advantage and they finished the job in Piraeus, after a spectacular 2–0 win against the Scottish Champions with Kritikopoulos and Stavropoulos finding the net. In the next round, they were drawn to play against Anderlecht for a place in the quarter-finals of the competition. Anderlecht won the first leg with 5–1 and Olympiacos&#x27; task seemed impossible. In the second leg in Greece, however, Olympiacos put on a dominant display and almost reached a winning score in a match that was marked by referee Károly Palotai&#x27;s decisions. Olympiacos beat Anderlecht 3–0, while Palotai disallowed four Olympiacos goals and did not give at least three clear penalties committed by Anderlecht players, while Stavropoulos was shown a red card for no good reason. The match is widely known in Greece as the &quot;Palotai massacre&quot; with Olympiacos coming close to one of the biggest comebacks in European Cup history.

=== Domination in the early 1980s, four consecutive League titles (1975–1987) ===

Following Goulandris resignation from the presidency in 1975, the team went through a relative dry spell in the second half of the 1970s. However, in the summer of 1979, the Greek championship turned professional and Stavros Daifas became owner and president of the club. Olympiacos emerged again as the dominant force in Greek football, winning the title four times in a row (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983) with players like the relentless goalscorer Nikos Anastopoulos, Martin Novoselac, Vicente Estavillo, Thomas Ahlström, Roger Albertsen, Maik Galakos, Tasos Mitropoulos, Takis Nikoloudis, Nikos Sarganis, Nikos Vamvakoulas, Giorgos Kokolakis, Vangelis Kousoulakis, Petros Michos, Takis Lemonis, Christos Arvanitis, Petros Xanthopoulos, Stavros Papadopoulos, Meletis Persias, Giorgos Togias and Kostas Orfanos.

Kazimierz Górski, the iconic Polish coach, led Olympiacos to the 1980, 1981 and 1983 titles (winning also the Double in 1981, the 9th Double in Olympiacos&#x27; history) while Alketas Panagoulias, who had also been manager of the Greece national football team and the United States national team as well, led the team to the 1982 title after a memorable 2–1 win (Estavillo 6&#x27;, Anastopoulos 69&#x27;) against arch-rivals Panathinaikos in the crucial Championship final match in Volos. With Panagoulias as head coach, Olympiacos won the 1986–87 title as well, having a solid roster with players from the early 1980s like Anastopoulos, Mitropoulos, Michos, Xanthopoulos and other strong players like Miloš Šestić, Giorgos Vaitsis, Jorge Barrios, Andreas Bonovas, Alexis Alexiou and Vasilis Papachristou.

=== The &quot;Stone Years&quot;, UEFA Cup quarter-finalists (1987–1996) ===

Olympiacos experienced its darkest days from the late-1980s until the mid-&#x27;90s. In the mid-&#x27;80s, Olympiacos came into the hands of Greek businessman George Koskotas who was soon accused of and convicted for embezzlement, leaving Olympiacos deep in debt. The club went through a period of administrative turbulence until 1993, when Sokratis Kokkalis became majority shareholder and president of the club. As soon as he took the club&#x27;s presidency, Kokkalis agreed a settlement to pay off all the club&#x27;s debts and started reorganising and restructuring the club. On the pitch, the team, with all the financial and managerial problems, as well as the lack of strong administrative leadership until the Kokkalis arrival, spent nine seasons without a league title, from 1988 to 1996, despite the foreign top-class players that played for the club at that period, such as Lajos Détári, Oleh Protasov, Juan Gilberto Funes, Bent Christensen, Hennadiy Lytovchenko, Yuri Savichev, Andrzej Juskowiak, Daniel Batista, Fabián Estay and the backbone of solid Greek players like Vassilis Karapialis, Kiriakos Karataidis, Giotis Tsalouchidis, Nikos Tsiantakis, Giorgos Vaitsis, Minas Hantzidis, Theodoros Pahatouridis, Savvas Kofidis, Chris Kalantzis, Gιorgοs Mitsibonas, Ilias Talikriadis, Alekos Rantos, Panagiotis Sofianopoulos, Ilias Savvidis and Michalis Vlachos. This period is so called as &quot;Olympiacos&#x27; stone years&quot;. Nevertheless, the club brought home the 1990 (beating OFI Crete 4–2 in the final) and 1992 Greek Cups (beating PAOK 2–0 in the second leg of the double final in Piraeus), as well as the 1992 Greek Super Cup, beating AEK 3–1 in the final. In addition, the team, under the guidance of the legendary Ukrainian coach Oleg Blokhin, managed to reach the quarter-finals of the 1992–93 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, eliminating Arsène Wenger&#x27;s Monaco, after a hard-fought 1–0 away win in Stade Louis II with a late goal by Giorgos Vaitsis and a goalless draw at Karaiskakis Stadium in the second leg. They did not manage to qualify for the semi-finals, however, as they were eliminated by Atlético Madrid (1–1 draw at home, 3–1 loss in Madrid).

=== The Golden Era (1996–2010) ===

==== Seven consecutive League titles, near-miss to UEFA Champions League semi-finals (1996–2003) ====
In 1996, Sokratis Kokkalis appointed Dušan Bajević as the team&#x27;s head coach. By that time, Olympiacos had already a very strong roster, with players like Kyriakos Karataidis, Vassilis Karapialis, Grigoris Georgatos, Alexis Alexandris, Giorgos Amanatidis, Nikos Dabizas and Ilija Ivić. Upon Bajević&#x27;s arrival, Kokkalis opted to strengthen the team significantly in order to create a very strong roster that would dominate Greek football for years to come. He purchased the highly rated prospects Predrag Đorđević and Stelios Giannakopoulos from Paniliakos, outbidding both AEK Athens and Panathinaikos; signed Refik Šabanadžović, Andreas Niniadis, Giorgos Anatolakis and Alekos Kaklamanos; and brought Olympiacos Academy product Dimitris Eleftheropoulos back from his loan spell at Proodeftiki. With all these players up front, Olympiacos strode to the 1996–97 title by 12 clear points over AEK and 20 points over the third Panathinaikos in Bajević&#x27;s first season in charge; this was the club&#x27;s first Greek Championship in nine seasons, putting an end to the &quot;stone years&quot; and officially beginning Olympiacos&#x27; era of domination. In the next season, 1997–98, Dimitris Mavrogenidis, Siniša Gogić, Ilias Poursanidis and the Ghanaian striker Peter Ofori-Quaye were transferred to the club and Olympiacos won the 1997–98 Championship. Bajević&#x27;s team, along with AEK and Panathinaikos, were closely separated in the table, but finally Olympiacos made an important away win against Panathinaikos (0–2) and celebrated the second consecutive Championship, with three points difference from Panathinaikos. Olympiacos participated for the first time in the UEFA Champions League group stage and took third place in a tough group, leaving Porto in fourth place, while Real Madrid, the eventual champions, topped the group and qualified for the quarter-finals.

The 1998–99 season was undoubtedly one of the best seasons in Olympiacos history. They won the 1998–99 Greek Championship quite convincingly, with ten points difference from AEK and 11 from third-placed Panathinaikos, and also celebrated the domestic double, bringing home the 1998–99 Greek Cup after a convincing 2–0 win against arch-rivals Panathinaikos in the final (Mavrogenidis 54&#x27;, Ofori-Quaye 90&#x27;), despite the fact that they played for more than 60 minutes in the game with ten players. In European competitions, they entered the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League group stage, being drawn in a group with Ajax, Porto and Croatia Zagreb. They won the group and qualified to the quarter-finals, gathering 11 points with 3 home wins against Ajax (1–0), Porto (2–1) and Croatia Zagreb (2–0) and two away draws in Porto (2–2) and Zagreb (1–1). In the quarter-finals of the competition, they faced Juventus, with the first leg in Turin. Juventus took a 2–0 lead, but Olympiacos scored a crucial away goal in the 90th minute of the game with a penalty by Andreas Niniadis, a goal that caused the 10.000 Olympiacos fans who travelled to Italy to erupt into joyous ecstasy. In the second leg in Athens, Olympiacos totally dominated the match, and scored the goal that put them in the driving seat in the 12th minute of the game, when Siniša Gogić&#x27;s powerful header found the back of the net after Grigoris Georgatos&#x27;s superb cross. They also missed an outstanding chance to double the lead, when Giorgos Amanatidis&#x27; powerful header from short distance was saved by Michelangelo Rampulla. Olympiacos kept the ticket to the semi-finals in his hands until the 85th minute, when Juventus, who hadn&#x27;t produced any chances in the game, equalised the score after a crucial mistake by Dimitris Eleftheropoulos, who had been the team&#x27;s hero in all the previous games. Despite the big disappointment from the way the qualification to the semi-finals was lost, the presence of the team in the Champions League quarter-finals, one of their best European campaigns, combined with the domestic double, marked a very successful season for the club, arguably the best in their long history.

The next four seasons (1999–2000, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2002–03) Olympiacos signed world-class players of great magnitude such as Giovanni, Zlatko Zahovič and the World champion Christian Karembeu, as well as other top-class players including Pär Zetterberg, Zé Elias, Nery Castillo, Christos Patsatzoglou, Lampros Choutos and Stelios Venetidis. These transfers strengthened even more the already strong roster from the previous successful years and under the guidance of coaches like Giannis Matzourakis, Takis Lemonis and Oleg Protasov (Bajević had left the club in 1999), Olympiacos managed to win seven consecutive Greek Championships (1997–2003), breaking their own past record of six (1954–1959). Olympiacos won their seventh consecutive title after a breathtaking closing of the 2002–03 Greek League: Olympiacos was hosting arch-rivals Panathinaikos in matchday 29, who led the table with a three-point difference. Olympiacos needed to win the derby by two clear goals in order to overthrow their rivals in the championship race. Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos 3–0 (Giovanni 3&#x27;, Giannakopoulos 15&#x27; 48&#x27;) in a dominant display in Rizoupoli and celebrated the all-time record of seven straight Championships, which was a dream and a historic objective for the club and especially for the fans.

==== Five consecutive League titles, Two presences in UEFA Champions League knockout phase (2004–2010) ====
In 2004, Olympiacos rehired Dušan Bajević and signed the 1999 World Footballer of the Year and 2002 World Champion Brazilian superstar Rivaldo and the 2004 European champion Antonis Nikopolidis. The end of the season found Olympiacos winning the domestic double and having a decent Champions League display, gathering ten points in a tough group alongside Liverpool, Monaco and Deportivo de La Coruña and losing the qualification to the knockout phase in the last four minutes of the last game against the eventual European champions Liverpool at Anfield. Bajević left the club and the Norwegian coach Trond Sollied was hired in his place. They club signed Cypriot striker Michalis Konstantinou from Panathinaikos, 2004 European champion defender Michalis Kapsis from Bordeaux and the versatile box-to-box Ivorian midfielder Yaya Touré. During the 2005–06 season, Olympiacos won all the four derbies against their major rivals, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens, something only achieved once more, during the season 1972–73. The combined goal total in these four matches was 11–3 in favour of Olympiacos. They also beat AEK Athens 3–0 in the Greek Cup Final to clinch their second-straight double and managed to win an all-time record of 16 consecutive matches in the championship, breaking their own past record.

After a record-breaking season, in the 2006 summer transfers, Trond Sollied signed Michał Żewłakow, Júlio César and Tomislav Butina among others. However, he did not live up to expectations in the 2006–07 Champions League and was replaced by Takis Lemonis at the end of 2006. Lemonis transferred the young star Vasilis Torosidis, and led Olympiacos in their third consecutive championship, but failed to win the Greek Cup after a surprise elimination by PAS Giannina.

In the summer of 2007, Olympiacos made very expensive transfers like Luciano Galletti, Darko Kovačević, Raúl Bravo, Lomana LuaLua, Cristian Ledesma and Leonel Núñez. They also brought back the solid Greek defender Paraskevas Antzas and signed the very talented young striker Kostas Mitroglou from Borussia Mönchengladbach. Furthermore, they accomplished the most lucrative sale in Greek football history after selling striker-midfielder Nery Castillo to Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk for the record sum of €20 million ($27.5M). Because of a clause in Castillo&#x27;s contract, Olympiacos received €15 million, with the remaining €5 million given directly to the player. Furthermore, a controversy started between the team and Rivaldo, as Olympiacos did not wish to renew the player&#x27;s contract despite the fact that Rivaldo had featured heavily in the club&#x27;s successful campaigns, both in Greece and abroad. Former player Ilija Ivić was selected for the role of the team&#x27;s football director. The team did not start well in the Greek championship, but it achieved a stunning performance in the Champions League, qualifying for the last 16 as they finished second in their group, level on 11 points with group winners Real Madrid, eliminating Werder Bremen and Lazio. However, the team&#x27;s less than satisfactory performance in the league, coupled with the defeat from Chelsea in Stamford Bridge for the knockout phase, prompted club owner Sokratis Kokkalis to sack coach Takis Lemonis. The team&#x27;s assistant manager, José Segura, coached the team for the remainder of the season. Olympiacos managed to win both the Greek Championship and Cup, but Segura left the club at the end of the season.

In the summer of 2008, Olympiacos made prominent transfers, signing Dudu Cearense, Avraam Papadopoulos, Diogo Luis Santo and Matt Derbyshire and appointed Ernesto Valverde as the new coach with a three-year contract worth approximately €6 million. The 2008–09 season started badly for Olympiacos, with the team losing their first few official matches, against Anorthosis Famagusta for the Champions League third qualifying round, and was eliminated from the tournament, which resulted to a seat in the UEFA Cup first round, where Olympiacos beat Nordsjælland to qualify for the group stage. The team also started well in the 2008–09 Super League Greece, winning every match at home, but facing difficulties away. They ended up winning the Greek Championship and the Greek Cup, celebrating the 14th double in Olympiacos history. After an impressive UEFA Cup run at home, with some spectacular wins against Benfica (5–1) and Hertha BSC (4–0), the team managed to get through to the round of 32, facing French side Saint-Étienne.

In the summer of 2009, Olympiacos signed major players, such as Olof Mellberg from Juventus for €2.5 million, midfielder Jaouad Zairi from Asteras Tripolis and Enzo Maresca from Sevilla. Many other players returned from loan spells, such as former Real Madrid defender Raúl Bravo, Georgios Katsikogiannis and midfielder Cristian Ledesma. Olympiacos appointed former Brazil legend Zico as their coach and started the 2009–10 season with great success, as they qualified for the Champions League final 16, finishing second in Group H only 3 points behind Arsenal, despite the absence of numerous first-team players due to injuries. They faced Bordeaux in the final 16 and lost the first match at home (0–1). In the second match, despite Bordeaux&#x27;s early lead, Olympiacos levelled the match and missed some great chances to score a second goal, before eventually losing in the dying moments of the match (1–2). Domestically, Olympiacos secured a 2–0 derby win over arch-rivals Panathinaikos, with striker Kostas Mitroglou scoring twice. However, this was only a highlight in an otherwise below-par season for the club, as they not only lost the championship to Panathinaikos, but were also defeated in four out of their six playoff games, eventually finishing last, in the 5th position of the league table; this result marked the team&#x27;s worst ranking since being placed 8th in 1988, and meant that the club would start their Europa League campaign from the second qualifying round the following season.

=== New presidency, seven consecutive League titles and European ascent (2010–2017) ===

In 2010, Evangelos Marinakis, a successful shipping magnate, bought the team from Sokratis Kokkalis. During the first year of his presidency, Marinakis appointed fans&#x27; favourite Ernesto Valverde as coach (who came back for a second tenure in the club) and signed players with international pedigree, such as Albert Riera, Ariel Ibagaza, Kevin Mirallas, Marko Pantelić and François Modesto. As a result, Olympiacos won the Greek title for the 38th time in its history, 13 points ahead of second-placed Panathinaikos.

In the 2011–12 season, the team&#x27;s roster was strengthened with players like Jean Makoun, Pablo Orbaiz, Iván Marcano, Rafik Djebbour and Djamel Abdoun and with Ernesto Valverde as their coach for the second straight season, Olympiacos had a very successful campaign both domestically and internationally. They won both the Greek league and the Greek Cup to complete the 15th domestic double in the club&#x27;s history. In European competitions, Olympiacos had a solid Champions League campaign, having been drawn in Group F against Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Marseille. Despite delivering nine points in the group, with two emphatic wins against Arsenal and Dortmund at home (both with a 3–1 scoreline) and an away win against Marseille (0–1), they lost the qualification to the knock-out stage after Marseille&#x27;s controversial 2–3 away win in Dortmund in game 6, with Marseille scoring two goals in the last five minutes of the match to come back from an early 2–0 Dortmund lead. Olympiacos continued in Europa League where he was drawn to play against Rubin Kazan. The Greek champions eliminated the Russian side with two wins (1–0 in both Kazan and Piraeus) and were up to play against Metalist Kharkiv in the Last 16 of the competition. They won the first match in Ukraine with David Fuster scoring the winning goal (0–1) but in the second match, despite their early lead and the plethora of missed chances (they hit the woodwork twice in the first half), they conceded two goals in the last nine minutes of the game and lost the qualification to the quarter-finals.

At the end of the season, Ernesto Valverde announced his decision to return to Spain, thus ending his second successful spell at Olympiacos. The club announced the Portuguese Leonardo Jardim as their new head coach. The team performed very well in the Greek league and had a decent Champions league campaign, gathering nine points in Group B, after wins against Arsenal (2–1 at home) and Montpellier (1–2 in Montpellier, 3–1 in Piraeus). Despite the relatively good results, Leonardo Jardim was replaced by the Spanish coach and Real Madrid legend Míchel. The team went on to celebrate the 16th double in their history by winning their 40th Greek Championship, 15 points ahead the second PAOK, as well as their 26th Greek Cup after a 3–1 win against Asteras Tripolis in the final. The 40th Greek championship title gave Olympiacos the fourth star on top of the club&#x27;s emblem, which was a major goal for the club and especially for the fans.

The expectations for the 2013–14 season were very high, especially after the signing of players such as striker Javier Saviola, Joel Campbell, Roberto, Alejandro Domínguez, Vladimír Weiss, Delvin N&#x27;Dinga and Leandro Salino. Olympiacos had a great season both domestically and internationally. In Europe, they were drawn in Group C of the 2013–14 Champions League alongside Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica and Anderlecht. After a strong performance in the group, Olympiacos finished second with ten points and qualified for the Last 16 at the expense of Benfica (1–0 win in Piraeus, 1–1 draw in Lisbon) and Anderlecht (0–3 win in Brussels, 3–1 win in Piraeus). In the round of 16, they were drawn to play against Manchester United. Olympiacos, after a solid display, won the first leg with a comfortable 2–0 (Alejandro Domínguez 38&#x27;, Campbell 55&#x27;), in a match where they dominated totally and missed chances to even extend the lead. Despite the two-goal advantage which put them within touching distance of a quarter-final place for the first time since 1999, Olympiacos lost 3–0 in the second leg in Old Trafford, having missed an outstanding double chance to equalise the score in the 40th minute. The Greek champions pushed on in the last ten minutes to find the crucial away goal, but to no avail. Although the ticket to the quarter-finals slipped out of the club&#x27;s hands, Olympiacos&#x27; overall performance and the fact that the club managed to qualify to the knockout phase (round of 16) of the Champions League for the third time in six years (2007–08, 2009–10, 2013–14), marked a very successful European campaign. Domestically, Olympiacos won their history&#x27;s 41st Greek Championship very convincingly, 17 points ahead of second-placed PAOK. He also participated in the International Champions Cup 2014 where he won 3rd place.

In the 2014–15 season, Olympiacos entered the 2014–15 Champions League group stage with hopes to repeat the previous year&#x27;s performance; they were drawn alongside Atlético Madrid, Juventus and Malmö FF. They had a solid performance in the group, managing to beat last year&#x27;s runners-up Atlético 3–2 and eventual finalists Juventus 1–0 at the Karaiskakis Stadium, but they lost the qualification for the knockout stage in the last game: Olympiacos beat Malmö FF 4–2 at home but at the same time Juventus were drawing against Atlético in Italy, securing the crucial one point they needed to qualify. Had Olympiacos and Juventus finished with the same points, Olympiacos would have qualified due to best aggregate score (away goals) of their two games (1–0 Olympiacos win in Piraeus, 3–2 Juventus win in Turin). The third place in the group gave Olympiacos the ticket for the next round of UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated by the eventual runners-up Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Domestically, the team had a very successful season, winning the 17th double in their history. They won their 42nd Greek Championship with 12 points difference from the second Panathinaikos and their 27th Greek Cup, beating Skoda Xanthi 3–1 in the final.

The 2015–16 season started with a new manager replacement, as Marco Silva took over the management over his fellow countryman Vitor Pereira, while the squad was strengthened with the world-class presence of Esteban Cambiasso and a number of other players with European competition experience, including Kostas Fortounis, Felipe Pardo, Sebá, Manuel Da Costa, Brown Ideye and Alfreð Finnbogason. In a tough Champions League group that included Bayern München, Arsenal and Dinamo Zagreb, Olympiacos managed to record 9 points through a 3–2 away win over the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium, considered by many as one of the club&#x27;s most important European victories, as well as two more wins against Dinamo (1–0 away and 2–1 at home). Last matchday saw the team face Arsenal at the Karaiskakis stadium, needing a 1–0 or 2–1 defeat to the Gunners, as the worst-case scenario, to advance to the knockout phase of the competition based on the away goals rule; the Red-Whites eventually lost 3–0 and continued their European journey in the UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated by Anderlecht in the first knockout stage. Despite the above, Olympiacos broke the record for most European competition victories recorded by a Greek club, with 97 over the 96 of second-placed Panathinaikos as of the summer of 2016. Domestically, Olympiacos had perhaps their most successful season in years, as the team managed to secure their 43rd Greek Championship, and 6th consecutive, on the last day of February 2016, considered a national record for the earliest time, within a league campaign, when a title is clinched. The team managed to finish their league campaign with a 30-point difference over their arch rivals Panathinaikos, who came in second. The team&#x27;s 85 points over the course of 30 matchdays, including a 28–1–1 overall result breakdown with 13 away wins and a perfect 15 victories out of 15 home games, are also considered a national record. However, despite the club&#x27;s expectations of doing the double, they did not manage to win the Greek Cup as they finished runners-up to rivals AEK after a 2–1 loss in the final.

The 2016–17 season proved to be rather tumultuous for the club, despite the signing of such key players as Óscar Cardozo, Tarik Elyounoussi, Alaixys Romao, Aly Cissokho and Marko Marin. The main issues that arose were the team&#x27;s shock elimination from Israeli outfit Hapoel Be&#x27;er-Sheva, after a 1–0 aggregate defeat, in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, and the highly frequent change of managers, leading the club to having been coached by five individuals over the same season: Marco Silva, Victor Sánchez (responsible for the elimination from Hapoel), Paulo Bento, Vasilis Vouzas and Takis Lemonis. The team&#x27;s UEFA Europa League journey was not as successful as other European campaigns, starting with a difficult 3–1 aggregate victory (1–1 before extra time) over Arouca in the playoffs, continuing with the team&#x27;s qualification from the group stage but only as second-placed to APOEL (in a group that also included Young Boys and Astana), and ending with a heavy 5–2 aggregate defeat to Besiktas in the last 16 of the knockout stage (with goalkeeper Nicola Leali being highly responsible for 4 out of the 5 goals conceded), despite having advanced from the last 32 thanks to a 3–0 aggregate win over Osmanlispor. The frequent manager change negatively affected the team&#x27;s stability and rhythm in domestic competitions as well. Firstly, Olympiacos failed to qualify for the Greek Cup final after being ousted by AEK, who advanced on the away goals rule after a 2–2 aggregate draw. Secondly, despite the fact that the Reds clinched their 44th Greek Championship, and 7th consecutive for the second time in Greek football history, they only managed to do so with a six-point difference (67 to 61) over PAOK.

=== European successes, three consecutive Greek League titles (2017–2023) ===

At the start of the 2017–18 season, the board decided to hire former Anderlecht manager Besnik Hasi to guide Olympiacos back to the UEFA Champions League group stage after a year&#x27;s absence. Upon his arrival, Hasi strengthened the squad with players as Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe, Guillaume Gillet, Mehdi Carcela, Jagoš Vuković, Björn Engels, Uroš Đurđević, Emmanuel Emenike and Panagiotis Tachtsidis.

Aggregate victories over Partizan (5–3) and Rijeka (3–1) in the two final qualifying rounds ensured the Red-Whites&#x27; presence in Group D of the competition, considered perhaps the toughest in Olympiacos&#x27; European history due to Barcelona, Juventus and Sporting CP being the opponents. A disheartening 2–3 defeat in the hands of Sporting at Thrylos&#x27; European season opener, combined with a 3–2 loss to AEK despite being 0–2 up, led to Hasi&#x27;s dismissal from the club and his replacement by Takis Lemonis. The latter decided to focus on getting the squad back on track in domestic competitions, at a time when Olympiacos eventually got eliminated from Europe ahead of the Christmas break for the first time in 12 years. Following a home goalless draw against Barcelona and five defeats, the Red-Whites only managed to acquire one point during their entire Champions League group stage campaign, something considered a setback for the club after their 7 previous UEFA Champions League campaigns (2007–08, 2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16), in which they gathered at least 9 points in all of the groups (11 points in 2007–08, 10 points in 2009–10, 9 points in 2011–12, 9 points in 2012–13, 10 points in 2013–14, 9 points in 2014–15 and 9 points in 2015–16), with three qualifications to the knockout stage (Last 16) of the competition. Despite their one-point group stage exit, the worst European records by a Greek team in the history of European competitions both belong to AEK Athens: AEK&#x27;s zero (0) point campaign in Group E of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League and AEK&#x27;s zero (0) point campaign as well in the Group H of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, a lower-tier UEFA competition. Panathinaikos has also a one-point campaign in Group G of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League. Despite being in the Super League lead halfway through the season, Lemonis was dismissed on grounds of dressing room instability, and Óscar García was subsequently appointed with a vision of increasing attacking efficiency and discipline. Domestically, Olympiacos&#x27; Greek Cup run ended in the quarter-finals, marking their third consecutive year that they failed to lift the Cup. In the Super League the Red-Whites conceded the title to AEK three matchdays before completion, thus ending a run of seven consecutive championship wins and leading to the dismissal of García after two months at the club&#x27;s helm, with Christos Kontis finishing the season as caretaker manager. Portuguese Pedro Martins was appointed head coach in order to lead Olympiacos at the following 2018–19 season.

In the 2018–19 season, the Reds tried to recover from their disastrous last season. Starting with consecutive qualifications over Swiss side FC Luzern (agg: 7–1) as well as English side Burnley (agg: 4–2), the club earned a spot at the Europa League group stages, in which they faced Italian giants AC Milan, Spanish side Real Betis as well as F91 Dudelange. Having 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, Thrylos needed a 2-goal or more victory against Milan in the last match to advance to the Round of 32, which they eventually earned with a 81st-minute penalty by Kostas Fortounis, eliminating the Rossoneri. The 2018–19 campaign eventually came to an end by Dynamo Kyiv in the Round of 32, with a 2–2 draw in Piraeus, followed by a 1–0 defeat in Kyiv. Domestically, despite having a way better season compared to 2017–18, the Red-Whites fell short champions PAOK, finishing just 5 points behind, while also suffering from a shock elimination to Lamia in the cup, ending the season trophyless for the second year in a row.

Despite his failure on a domestic level, Pedro Martins kept his position as manager of the team, who, having kept key players from last season, such as Daniel Podence, Guilherme and Mady Camara as well as strengthening the squad with Mathieu Valbuena, Youssef El-Arabi and Rúben Semedo, led the club to one of its greatest seasons in the past decade. Starting at Champions League 2nd qualifying round, Olympiacos defeated emphatically Viktoria Plzeň (agg: 4–0), İstanbul Başakşehir (agg: 3–0) and FC Krasnodar (agg: 6–1), comfortably securing their return in the group stage and becoming the only Greek club to achieve 3 successive qualifications to the group stage of the competition. Having been drawn to eventual winners Bayern Munich, London side Tottenham Hotspur and Red Star Belgrade, the Reds got a hard-fought point at their first game against Spurs at Karaiskakis, despite being down 0–2 in the 30th minute, with goals by Daniel Podence and Mathieu Valbuena on 44th and 54th minute respectively. They then went on to lose their 3 next fixtures, needing a win in Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to keep qualification dreams alive. Despite being 2–0 up, a crucial mistake by Yassine Meriah in the dying seconds of the first half gave Spurs the motivation to eventually win 4–2. Olympiacos then won their last game against Crvena Zvezda at home thanks to a late El Arabi penalty, to continue in the Europa League. In the Round of 32, Thrylos got one of their brightest moments in their history, as they managed to eliminate their European rivals Arsenal on away goals (agg: 2–2), with a late El Arabi goal in the last minute of extra time in Emirates stadium, advancing to the last 16, where they faced Wolves. After a 1–1 draw in Piraeus without their fans, the competition stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eventually resuming in August 2020, where Olympiacos&#x27; campaign stopped after a 1–0 defeat in Molineux Stadium with many controversial decisions by referee Szymon Marciniak. Domestically, the Reds won their first league title since 2017 with a record 91 points, 18 points clear of PAOK and almost managing to complete an undefeated run before losing 0–1 to PAOK in the third-to-last matchday. They also won the double by defeating AEK Athens 1–0 in the cup final, marking one of their most successful seasons both domestically and internationally.

The 2020–21 season started well for Olympiacos, securing their presence in the Champions League group stage for the 2nd year in a row, defeating Cyprtiot champions Omonia Nicosia 2–0 on aggregate. However, their campaign was rather mediocre having 1 win and 5 losses, in a group against Portuguese champions FC Porto, English giants Manchester City and French Marseille. They still however got 3rd-place finishing above Marseille on head to head away goals, both tied on 3 points. In the Europa League, they managed to defeat PSV Eindhoven beating them 4–2 at home and losing 2–1 at Philips Stadion, going through thanks to a 88th-minute goal by Ahmed Hassan. They then had to face Arsenal once again in the Round of 16, this time however losing 2–3 on aggregate despite beating them 0–1 in Emirates and closing their campaign with a win. Domestically they dominated the league once again, finishing 26 points above 2nd-placed PAOK, to whom they lost the Greek Cup in the dying moments of the final.

The beginning of the 2021–22 season had Olympiacos being eliminated in the Champions League, where they lost to Bulgarian Ludogorets Razgrad 4–1 on penalties after 2 draws in Piraeus (1–1) and Razgrad (2–2) in the third qualifying round. They then beat ŠK Slovan Bratislava in the play-off round to secure a Europa League group stage spot. In a group with Eintracht Frankfurt, Fenerbahçe and Antwerp, Olympiacos finished second behind Eintracht with 3 wins and 3 losses and qualified for the knockout-round play-offs, where they met Italian side Atalanta, who eliminated them 5–1 on aggregate. Despite securing another Greek League title, Thrylos failed to win the cup for the second year in a row being eliminated by PAOK again on away goals. Martins remained manager of the club and renewed his contract for a fifth year, becoming one of the managers with the longest stay in the club.

After four seasons and winning 3 League titles with the club, Martins got fired from Olympiacos, in August 2022, and Spanish trainer Carlos Corberán was appointed as the new head coach. He was succeeded by Michel, who later resigned and the 2022–23 season was completed by José Anigo.

=== UEFA Europa Conference League Winners &amp; UEFA Youth League Winners (2023–24) ===
The 2023–24 Season began with Diego Martinez in charge, until being sacked in December, having the team in 4th place in the League and out of the Europa League, to be replaced by Carlos Carvalhal, whose stint only lasted for 2 months before being replaced by José Luis Mendilibar. Domestically, the club finished 3rd for the second consecutive time, and was eliminated in the Round of 16 of the Greek Cup.

However, the European campaign of this season proved to be the best in Olympiacos history. Beginning in the Europa League third qualifying round, the club ensured a group stage participation for the third season in a row, after knocking out Belgian KRC Genk and Serbian rookies FK Čukarički. There, they secured the 3rd place, finishing with 7 points and transferring to the Europa Conference League. After knocking out Hungarian champion Ferencváros in the play-offs with 2 Ayoub El Kaabi goals, they faced Israeli Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Round of 16, and got stunned by a 1–4 defeat at Karaiskakis Stadium. However, in the return fixture in TSC Arena, in front of 49 loyal supporters, the Red-Whites managed to achieve one of the greatest comebacks in the history of European football, by winning 6–1 on extra time and becoming the only football club to overcome a 3-goal home deficit in UEFA competitions.

Entering a European quarter-final for the first time since 1998–99, their next opponent were Fenerbahçe, whom they beat 3–2 at home, thanks to goals from Kostas Fortounis, Stevan Jovetić and Chiquinho. In the second leg in Şükrü Saracoğlu, the game ended 1–0 in favour of Fenerbahçe, thanks to a 12th-minute İrfan Kahveci goal. Eventually, the tie went to an extra time and then to a penalty shootout. There, 21-year old goalkeeper Konstantinos Tzolakis made history, saving 3 penalties in total, including the decisive one by Leonardo Bonucci and earning Olympiacos its first-ever appearance in a European semi-final in their 99-year history, winning 2–3 on penalties.

In the semi-final, Olympiacos had to face Aston Villa, whom at the time were 4th in the Premier League and were in one of their best seasons under Unai Emery. Despite entering the tie as massive underdogs, Olympiacos crushed the Villans with a 6–2 aggregate score, winning both legs and having El Kaabi scoring 5 goals, tying a record held by Cristiano Ronaldo and Radamel Falcao. This marked the first time a Greek Club entered the final of a European competition since 1971. Their final opponent, was Italian powerhouse ACF Fiorentina, who themselves appeared in the last year&#x27;s final, losing 1–2 to West Ham in the last minute of the match.

The final was held in rival&#x27;s AEK Agia Sophia Stadium on 29 May, the same day Constantinople fell 571 years prior. Pressure was immense going into the game, with thousands of fans coming to support the team in the stadium and hundreds of thousands of others watching the game in the streets of Piraeus. A close game, poor in chances and with a lot of tension ended in a 0–0 draw after 90 minutes. With everything looking like the tie would be settled on penalties, a 116th minute cross by Santiago Hezze landed on El Kaabi&#x27;s head, who put the ball in Terracciano&#x27;s net to make it 1–0, causing delirium among millions of Olympiacos fans all over the world. After a VAR check by Artur Soares Dias, the goal was confirmed and the game ended in that score, with Olympiacos making history and becoming the only Greek football club to win a UEFA competition. This has been described by many as the greatest achievement in the history of Greek Football, since the Greek national team&#x27;s Euro 2004 victory. The club&#x27;s achievement is highlighted by the fact that their odds of winning the competition after their 1–4 home loss to Maccabi in the Round of 16, were at just 0.1%.

Five weeks earlier, Olympiacos Youth U-19 team celebrated winning the UEFA Youth League beating Milan in the final that held at the Colovray Stadium in Nyon, Switzerland, to secure their first title in the competition. Olympiacos Youth U-19 team faced Flamengo in Under-20 Intercontinental Cup but was defeated with a score of 2-1.

===Globe Soccer Awards===
Olympiacos was awarded as the revelation team of 2024 at the Globe Soccer Awards.

== Crest and colours ==
When, in 1925, the merger of the two clubs of Piraeus, Athlitikos Podosfairikos Syllogos Pireos and Omilos Filathlon Pireos, gave birth to the new football club, the latter was unanimously baptised &quot;Olympiacos Club of Fans of Piraeus&quot;, a name inspired from the Ancient Olympic Games, the morality, the vying, the splendor, the sportsmanship and the fair play ideal that were represented in Ancient Greece. Consequently, after Notis Kamperos&#x27;s proposal, the club adopted the laurel-crowned adolescent as their emblem, which symbolises the Olympic Games winner, a crest that underwent minor changes through the ages. Red and white were chosen as the colours of the crest; red for the passion and victory and white for the virtue and purity.

The typical kit of the team is that of a shirt with red and white vertical stripes, and red or white shorts and socks. The shirt has taken different forms during the history of the club, for example with thin or wider stripes. The second most common kit is the all-red one and next the all-white one. Olympiacos has used several other colours during its history as an away or third kit, with the most notable of them being the monotint black or silver one. The most common kits of Olympiacos during their history are these below (the year of each one is indicant):

=== Kit evolution ===

=== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ===
Since 1979, when football became professional in Greece, Olympiacos had a specific kit manufacturer and since 1982 a specific shirt sponsor as well. The following table shows in detail Olympiacos kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors by year:

== Stadium ==


The Karaiskakis Stadium, situated at Neo Faliro in Piraeus, is the current (since 2004) and traditional home of Olympiacos. With a capacity of 32,115, it is the largest football-only stadium and the second largest football stadium overall in Greece. It was built in 1895 as Neo Phaliron Velodrome, to host the cycling events for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, and the pitch was covered with curm. Olympiacos started using it since its foundation in 1925. In 1964, the stadium was renovated and was given its current name after Georgios Karaiskakis, a military commander of the Greek War of Independence, with an athletics track around the pitch.

Olympiacos left the Karaiskakis Stadium temporarily to play home matches at the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium in 1984. After a five-year use (1984–1989) of the biggest stadium in Greece, the team returned to their traditional home, where they played until 1997. It was then that Olympiacos got back to the Athens Olympic Stadium, where they stayed for another period of five years (1997–2002). In 2002, the Olympic Stadium was closed for renovation works due to the 2004 Summer Olympics and Olympiacos moved to the Georgios Kamaras Stadium in Rizoupoli, home of Apollon Smyrnis, for the following two seasons (2002–2004).

Meanwhile, the Karaiskakis Stadium had fallen in disrepair and was not any more suitable for football matches. In 2003, its use passed to Olympiacos in order to build a football-only ground, to be used for the football tournament of the 2004 Olympics. In return, Olympiacos got exclusive use of the stadium until 2052, covering all maintenance costs and also paying 15% of revenue to the Greek State. The old stadium was demolished in the spring of 2003 and the new one was completed on 30 June 2004 at a total cost of €60 million. Nowadays, the Karaiskakis Stadium is one of the most modern football grounds in Europe, also hosting the museum of Olympiacos, with several facilities around.

== Support ==

Olympiacos&#x27; traditional fanbase comes from the city of Piraeus, where the club is based, as well as a good part of the rest of the Athens area. The club&#x27;s popularity increased during the 1950s after winning consecutive titles and setting several records, and they became the best-supported football club in the country. Traditionally, Olympiacos used to represent the working class, but the club has always attracted fans from all the social classes and their fanbase is not associated with any specific social group any more.

Olympiacos is the most popular Greek club according to UEFA and numerous polls and researches. Several newspapers and magazines&#x27; polls rank Olympiacos as the most popular club in Greece with a percentage varying between 30 and 40% among the fans and more or less 30% in total population, which corresponds to around three and a half millions of supporters in Greece. The club is overwhelmingly popular in Piraeus, where almost half of its population supports Olympiacos, while their support in the whole of Athens reaches 30% of the fans, making them the 3rd most popular club in the Greek capital. They are also the most popular club in the working class with a percentage of 37% and in all age groups, as well as among both male and female fans; the vast majority of their fans comes from the centre-left and centre-right of the political spectrum. Outside of Athens, Olympiacos is the most popular club in Central Greece, the Peloponnese, and Thessaly. Additionally, they have the highest average all-time attendance in Greek football, having topped the attendance tables in most of the seasons in Super League Greece history.

=== Friendships ===
* Red Star Belgrade
* Spartak Moscow

In 2006, Olympiacos was placed in the top ten of the clubs with the most paying members in the world, holding ninth place, just ahead of Real Madrid. As of April 2006, the club had some 83,000 registered members. Olympiacos and Red Star Belgrade fans have developed a deep friendship, calling themselves the &quot;Orthodox Brothers&quot;. Usually, Olympiacos supporters from several fan-clubs attend Red Star&#x27;s matches, especially against their old rival Partizan, and vice versa. More recently, the Orthodox Brothers have started to include fans of Spartak Moscow in their club.

Olympiacos fans are renowned for their passionate and fervent support to the team, with the atmosphere at home matches regarded as intimidating. When they played Newcastle United at home in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, the match was televised in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 and the guest commentator was former England international Tony Cottee, who was constantly mentioning how great the atmosphere was. During the game he was asked whether it was the most atmospheric stadium he had been to and replied: &quot;I&#x27;d have to say it probably is. You hear a lot about various places and the atmosphere there but when you go you realise it&#x27;s not all that... But this place is the real deal.&quot; The experienced Czech international winger Jaroslav Plašil paid further testament to the hostile atmosphere created by Olympiacos fans at home before his team Bordeaux visit the Karaiskakis Stadium, where he had played during his time with Monaco and stated, &quot;It was one of the most intense atmospheres I&#x27;ve ever experienced in a stadium, so I expect it will be a bit like hell for us. Their supporters really can help their team.&quot; Former Paris Saint-Germain superstar striker Zlatan Ibrahimović spoke of his admiration for Olympiacos supporters after an Olympiacos–Paris Saint-Germain match on 17 September 2013: &quot;They played in front of their fantastic public. Olympiacos supporters were amazing. My friend Olof Mellberg played here and he talked to me about the supporters. I never saw it live, but now I understand. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s a big advantage for Olympiacos.&quot; PSG billionaire owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi stated, &quot;I have big respect for the fans here. I&#x27;ve never seen fans like Olympiacos&#x27; fans in my life.&quot; PSG and Brazil international winger Lucas Moura in an interview with goal.com stated that Olympiacos home ground was the most intense and heated stadium he&#x27;s ever played in.

=== The Gate 7 tragedy ===

The history of the Karaiskakis Stadium and Olympiacos was marked by the worst tragedy that ever hit Greek sports, known as the Karaiskakis Stadium disaster. On 8 February 1981, Olympiacos hosted AEK Athens for a league match, which ended 6–0, in an unprecedented triumph for the host team of Piraeus. During the last minutes of the game, thousands of Olympiacos fans at the Gate 7 rushed to the exit, to get to the stadium&#x27;s main entrance and celebrate with the players, but the doors were almost closed and the turnstiles still in place, making the exit almost impossible. As people continued to come down from the stands, unable to see what happened, the stairs of Gate 7 became a death trap; people were crushed, tens of fans were seriously injured and twenty-one young people died, most of them by suffocation.

In memory of this event, every year on 8 February, there is a memorial service at the stadium in honour of the supporters that died in that incident. The service is attended by thousands of fans every year, who are rhythmically shouting the phrase, &quot;Αδέρφια, ζείτε, εσείς μας οδηγείτε.&quot; (Adhélfia, zíte, esís mas odhiyíte, &quot;Brothers, you live, you are the ones who guide us.&quot;). At the tribune part of the stadium where Gate 7 is now, some seats are coloured black instead of red, shaping the number &quot;7&quot;, whereas there is also a monument on the eastern side of the stadium, bearing the names of all 21 supporters killed on that day in the stadium.

Even though this incident affected almost solely the fanbase of Olympiacos, other teams occasionally pay their respects to the people killed as well, as they consider the incident to be a tragedy not only for one team, but for the whole country. In the past, even foreign teams, such as Liverpool and Red Star Belgrade, have honoured the incident&#x27;s victims.

== Rivalries ==


Traditionally, Olympiacos&#x27; main rival is Panathinaikos and their so-called &quot;derby of the eternal enemies&quot; is a classic local derby in Attica, the most famous fixture in Greek football and one of the most well known around the world. The two clubs are the most successful, having won together a total of 67 League titles (Olympiacos 47, Panathinaikos 20), and the most popular football clubs in Greece. The rivalry also encompasses social, cultural and regional differences; Olympiacos, coming from the famous port of Piraeus, used to be very popular in the working to middle classes, while Panathinaikos, of downtown Athens, was considered the representative of middle to higher social classes, although this differentiation has weakened nowadays and the two clubs have similar fanbases. Most recent notorious incidents include a fan&#x27;s death in 2007, during a pre-arranged clash between hooligans on the occasion of a women&#x27;s volleyball game between the two clubs, which caused major upset in Greece, and the abandonment of a derby in 2012 after riots at the Athens Olympic Stadium, which resulted in major fires in parts of it.

Olympiacos also shares a traditional rivalry with AEK Athens, in one more local derby of the Greek capital with the other member of the so-called Big three, but also with PAOK, in the fiercest inter-city rivalry in Greece between the most popular clubs of the two largest Greek cities, Athens and Thessaloniki, a rivalry that erupted in the 1960s for the sake of footballer Giorgos Koudas. A popular rivalry used to be the Piraeus derby, between Olympiacos and Ethnikos Piraeus, the second most successful football club in the region, but the fixture has faded-out due to Ethnikos&#x27; constant presence in lower divisions in the last decades. It remains a derby in water polo where Olympiacos and Ethnikos compete in the top division.

==European and International performance==

Olympiacos is the most successful Greek football club in European competitions, being the only club from Greece to have won a major European trophy; they won the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2023–24, sealing their title by winning against Italian side Fiorentina 1–0 in the Final. With their 2024 triumph, they became the first club outside the biggest four European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, La Liga and Bundesliga) to win a UEFA competition since 2011.

They are also the highest ranked Greek club in the UEFA rankings, occupying the 36th place in the ten-year ranking, and the 43rd in the five-year ranking as of 2024. They are one of the founding members of the European Club Association. They are also the Greek club with the most wins in all European competitions, leading also the table with the most home and away wins, and the Greek team with the most games played in European level, celebrating their 200th match on 23 February 2010, against Bordeaux in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League first knockout round. Olympiacos also holds the all-time record attendance for a Greek club of 75,263 in a 1982–83 European Cup match against Hamburg at the Athens Olympic Stadium.

Olympiacos has a long presence in the UEFA competitions, debuting on 13 September 1959, against Milan for the 1959–60 European Cup, the first ever Greek club to compete in a European competition. Olympiacos was also the first Greek club to advance to the next round of any European competition, eliminating Zagłębie Sosnowiec for the 1963–64 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Besides their 2023–24 UEFA Conference League triumph, other major European successes include their advance to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 1998–99, where they lost a semi-final spot in the dying minutes to Juventus and their advance to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1992–93, losing to Atlético Madrid.
Olympiacos has eliminated (in either finals, knockout matches or group stages) clubs like Milan, Arsenal, Ajax, Benfica, Porto, Borussia Dortmund, Lazio, Celtic, PSV Eindhoven, Aston Villa, Werder Bremen, Fiorentina, Anderlecht, Monaco, Deportivo La Coruña, Hertha BSC, Cagliari and Standard Liège among many others. They have spent most of their European history in the UEFA Champions League, where they are widely known for being a strong home side, having run some long-standing sequences, such as the 15 straight UEFA Champions League unbeaten home matches since their debut in the tournament under its new format, when Manchester United stopped their record in their fifth consecutive participation, and their 15 wins in 19 UEFA Champions League home matches between 2009–10 and 2014–15. They have a vast record of home wins over traditional European powerhouses and UEFA Champions League winners like Real Madrid, Milan, Liverpool, Manchester United, Ajax, Juventus, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Benfica, Porto, PSV Eindhoven, Celtic, Aston Villa, Olympique Lyonnais, Olympique Marseille, Atlético Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla, Leverkusen and Red Star Belgrade among many others. From 2007 to 2016, Olympiacos participated seven times in the UEFA Champions League Group Stage, and gathered at least 9 points in every one of those seven groups, qualifying three times for the knockout stage (Last 16) of the competition (2007–08, 2009–10, 2013–14).

Olympiacos has also won the Balkans Cup in 1963, at a time when the competition was considered the second most important in the region after the European Cup, becoming the first ever Greek club to win an international competition.

Another major European success was achieved by Olympiacos U-19 team in 2023–24 season. One month before Olympiacos won the 2023–24 UEFA Europa Conference League, Olympiacos U-19 team won the UEFA Youth League against AC Milan in the final, eliminating Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Nantes in the process. Thus, Olympiacos won two out of four official UEFA club competitions of the 2023–24 season and became the only club in European football to have won two UEFA competitions at the same season. 

The youth team of Olympiacos in the 2024 season as European champions played the final of the U20 Intercontinental Cup against Flamengo and the red and white team were defeated with a score of 2-1, nevertheless the youth of Olympiacos made a historic participation in the final of the competition.

<doc id="1229557" wikidata="Q2888498" url="?curid=1229557" title="Battle of Møn">
<text>The Battle of Møn, also known as the Battle of Fehmarn, took place 31 May–1 June 1677, as part of the Scanian War. A smaller Swedish squadron under Admiral Erik Sjöblad attempted to sail from Gothenburg to join the main Swedish fleet in the Baltic Sea. It was intercepted by a superior Danish-Norwegian force under Niels Juel and decimated over the course of two days. The Swedes lost 8 ships and over 1,500 men dead, injured or captured, including Admiral Sjöblad himself, while the Danish losses were insignificant.

The victory prevented the Swedish navy from concentrating its forces and provided valuable prize ships for the Danish navy. It confirmed Danish supremacy at sea during the war and laid the ground for the major Danish-Norwegiam victory at Køge Bay 1–2 July that same year.

==Prelude==
Henrik Horn was appointed commander-in-chief of the Swedish navy in March 1677, becoming the third consecutive navy chief (after Gustaf Otto Stenbock and Lorentz Creutz) without any naval experience. The Danish fleet, on the other hand, was well-staffed with capable, experienced officers, which placed the Swedes at a marked disadvantage from the outset. Horn was quickly informed that Dutch reinforcements under Tromp were heading for the Baltic, and on 21 April he was received orders from King Charles to join the main body of the Swedish fleet with a minor squadron anchored off Gothenburg under the command of Erik Sjöblad. The main fleet did not get to sea until early June, but Sjöblad nevertheless sailed as early as 20 May to join Horn. Sjöblad tried to sail through the Great Belt, but was becalmed for on the 23rd and did not pass Langeland until the 29th.
 Danish admiral Niels Juel, victor of the battles of Bornholm and Öland in 1676 was already at sea with 13 large warships, a yacht and two fireships when he received the report on Sjöblad&#x27;s position on 28 May; within two days, the two fleets had sighted one another.

The Danish force was superior in numbers, armament and quality of equipment. Sjöblad&#x27;s force had nine ships to Juel&#x27;s 13, eight of which had 50 or more guns. The Danish ships were also dedicated warships while the Swedish vessels were armed merchants and less suited for battle. In total, the Swedes had 394 guns while the Danes had nearly 670, and the heaviest guns on the Swedish sides were merely 12-pounders, a relatively light caliber for naval artillery.

==Battle==
Juel had taken up a position between the Swedish squadron and the outlet between the German mainland and the island of Falster. After a war council on 30 May, the Swedish force decided to attempt to sail around the Danish force and set a course for east-northeast on 31 May. The wind abated once more that day and both sides began towing their ships to make headway. The Swedish force tried to stay in formation by setting the pace by the slowest ships, and later that afternoon, the first Danish ships came within firing range. Before night fell, Drejer of &quot;Enigheden&quot; managed to overtake and capture &quot;Wrangel Palats&quot;. During the night, the wind picked up once more, which was to Juel&#x27;s benefit.

On the morning of 1 June, the Danish force had the wind at their backs (the weather gauge) and could rake Sjöblad&#x27;s force with their heavier guns while still keeping out of range of the lighter Swedish artillery. Since the wind was too light for coordinated maneuvers, Juel gave orders for every captain to attack the nearest enemy ship to sink or capture them. By 4 o&#x27;clock, Juel&#x27;s flagship &quot;Christianus V&quot; had caught up with Sjöblad&#x27;s &quot;Amarant&quot; and after an intense artillery duel that lasted two hours, the Swedish flagships lost a yard and had its largest topsail shot to pieces. Per Rosenlund of the &quot;Andromeda&quot; tried to turn around to assist his admiral, but his crew refused to follow orders since they &quot;did not want to go back and let themselves be slaughtered like sheep&quot;. Sjöblad had to surrender and was taken prisoner. &quot;Kalmar Kastell&quot; was attacked by four Danish ships and also struck its colors. The captain of the Swedish ship, Cornelis Thijssen, gave his artillery officer orders to shoot up the ship&#x27;s hull, and the Danish boarding party had to quickly ground the ship at Falster, later only managing to salvage the guns and the rig.

One after the other, the Swedish ships came under attack: &quot;Havsfrun&quot; and &quot;Ängeln Gabriel&quot; were both overtaken while the rest of the fleet managed to escape. &quot;Rosen&quot; and five smaller ships tried to turn back to Gothenburg through Öresund. &quot;Rosen&quot; hoisted the English flag and managed to deceive the Danish land defenses, but two others were captured. Only &quot;Andromeda&quot;, the badly damaged &quot;Gustavus&quot; and one fireship managed to escape into the Baltic to join with the Swedish main fleet south of Öland.

==Aftermath==
The captured Swedish ships and the prisoners were brought to Copenhagen. Sjöblad was exchanged for Danish prisoners on 15 August and was given command of Gothenburg&#x27;s defenses. The Danish losses were limited to damage on some of the ships — the mainmast of &quot;Churprinsen&quot; broke during the battle — while the losses in men were very low. On Juel&#x27;s flagships, for example, there was only one death and two injuries reported. However, Juel was not satisfied with the behavior of some of his subordinates and court martialed several. Five of his captains were accused of violating orders or showing lack of discipline. One was completely exonerated, while the others were convicted for disciplinary offenses and fined or had their pay reduced.

The Danish-Norwegian victory had thwarted the Swedish attempt to concentrate their forces. Juel avoided having to fight a much larger Swedish fleet and managed to give the Danish navy a welcome addition of ships. The Swedish losses, on the other hand, were over 1,500 wounded, injured or captured. The defeat weakened the Swedish fleet while strengthening the Danes. Exactly one month later, the two main fleets met at the Battle of Køge Bay, an engagement which would become the greatest Danish victory at sea and which would raise Niel Juel to hero status.

<doc id="1229560" wikidata="Q968167" url="?curid=1229560" title="Alexander Chayanov">
<text>Alexander Vasilyevich Chayanov (; 17 January 1888 – 3 October 1937) was a Russian, then Soviet agrarian economist, scholar of rural sociology, and advocate of agrarianism and cooperatives.

==Personal life==
Chayanov was born in Moscow, the son of a merchant, Vasily Ivanovich Chayanov, and an agronomist, Elena Konstantinovna (born Klepikova). He attended a Realschule (1899–1906) and the Moscow Agricultural Institute (1906–1911), becoming an agronomist; he taught and published works on agriculture until 1914, when he began working for various government institutions. In 1912 he married Elena Vasilevna Grigorieva, a marriage that lasted until 1920. In 1921 he married Olga Emmanuilovna Gurevich; they had sons Nikita (born 1922) and Vasily (born 1925).

==After the Russian Revolution==
After the October Revolution, he served on several Soviet committees for agrarian reform and was a member of Narkomzem as well as &quot;holding lecturing and administrative posts at several universities and academies.&quot;

He was a proponent of agricultural cooperatives, but was skeptical about the inefficiency of large-scale farms. Chayanov&#x27;s skepticism was rooted in the idea that households, especially peasant households which practice subsistence farming, will tend to produce only the amount of food that they need to survive. He believed that the Soviet government would find it difficult to force these households to cooperate and produce a surplus. These views were sharply criticized by Joseph Stalin as &quot;defence of the kulaks&quot;.

===Prosecution===
In 1930 Chayanov was arrested in the (Трудовая крестьянская партия), fabricated by the NKVD. The process was intended to be a show trial, but Stalin decided that the case did not look sufficiently convincing and ordered a conviction in a secret trial («в закрытом порядке», &quot;in a closed manner&quot;). In 1932 Chayanov was sentenced to five years in the Kazakhstan labor camps. 

In 1937, Chayanov was arrested again and was shot after his name appeared on an execution list signed by Stalin and Molotov.

==Aftermath and rehabilitation==
His wife Olga was repressed as well and spent 18 years in labour camps; she was released in 1955 and died in 1983. Chayanov was rehabilitated in 1987.

==Published work==
Chayanov&#x27;s major works, &quot;Peasant Farm Organisation&quot; (originally published in Russian in 1925) and &quot;On the Theory of Non-Capitalist Economic Systems&quot; were first translated into English in 1966. Chayanov&#x27;s theory of the peasant household influenced economic anthropology. The substantivist Marshall Sahlins drew on Chayanov in his theory of the domestic mode of production, but later authors have argued that Chayanov&#x27;s use of neo-classical economics supports a formalist position.

His book &quot;Puteshestvie moego brata Alekseia v stranu krest’ianskoi utopii&quot; [My brother Alexei&#x27;s journey into the land of peasant utopia] (Moskva: Gosizdat, 1920) predicted a rapid transfer of power into peasant hands; its hero wakes up in 1984, &quot;in a country where the village has conquered the city, where handicraft cooperatives have replaced industry.&quot; Like Evgeny Zamyatin&#x27;s &quot;We&quot;, it contains theosophical elements.

Between 1918 and 1928 he also wrote five Gothic stories which he published at his own expense under the pseudonyms Anthropologist A, Phytopathologist U, and Botanist Kh (), with illustrations by his friends; three of them have been translated into English.

==Consumption-labour-balance principle==
The higher the ratio of dependents to workers in a household, the harder the workers have to work. Chayanov proposed that peasants would work as hard as they needed in order to meet their subsistence needs, but had no incentive beyond those needs and therefore would slow and stop working once they were met. The principle, which is called the &quot;consumption-labour-balance principle&quot;, is therefore that labour will increase until it meets (balances) the needs (consumption) of the household. This view of peasant farming implies that it will not develop into capitalism without some external, added factor. Furthermore, the peasant&#x27;s way of life is seen as ideologically opposed to capitalism in that the family work for a living, not for a profit. Evidence for this principle is found in the actions of Turkish peasants after the collapse of cereal prices in 1929.
===In practice===
In practice, the consumption-labour-balance principle means that accounting is not as precise on a farm than in a regular financial capitalist company. This, as there is no separation between capital and labour. Accounting works with an artificial cost structure which charges all kinds of costs which in reality, a farm does not have. For example, wage and farm-grown animals as well as organic fertiliser and animal feed are charged against commercial (artificial) fertiliser and composed animal feeds. A bought tractor is written off in four years against the bought value while the farmer often buys a second
hand tractor and carries along with it for another 15 years.

==Chayanov&#x27;s influence==
Chayanov&#x27;s ideas have survived him. His work was rediscovered by Westerners in the mid-1960s. Agricultural sociologists, anthropologists and ethnologists working in developing countries, where the peasant economy remains a predominant factor, apply his theory to help understand the nature of the family labour farm. Halil İnalcık, the leading historian of the Ottoman Empire, applied his ideas to peasant land tenure in the Ottoman Empire.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, Vladimir Megre&#x27;s &quot;Ringing Cedars&quot; series have many points in common with Chayanov.

<doc id="1229566" wikidata="Q853909" url="?curid=1229566" title="Guadalupe Island">
<text>Guadalupe Island () is a volcanic island located off the western coast of Mexico&#x27;s Baja California peninsula and about southwest of the city of Ensenada in the state of Baja California, in the Pacific Ocean. The various volcanoes are extinct or dormant. In 2005 Guadalupe Island and its surrounding waters and islets were declared a biosphere reserve to restore its vegetation (decimated by feral goats) and to protect its population of marine mammals and birds. The island was a popular destination for great white shark cage diving prior to a tourism ban was set in place in 2022. Guadalupe Island is inhabited only by scientists, military personnel operating a weather station, and a small group of seasonal fishermen. The island is mostly arid and has very little surface water.

The two other Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the continental shelf are the Revillagigedo Islands and Rocas Alijos. Guadalupe Island and its islets are the westernmost region of Mexico.

==Discovery and history==
The first known sighting of Guadalupe Island was in 1602 when a Spanish expedition headed by Sebastián Vizcaíno sailed by but did not land on the island. In the late 18th and 19th centuries the island was frequently visited by fur seal, otter, and elephant seal hunters. Goats were probably introduced by seal hunters in the early 1800s and quickly increased their numbers, nearly eradicating the indigenous vegetation.

==Administration and population==
The 2010 census recorded a population of 213 people on the island. In 2015, it was estimated to have fewer than 150 permanent residents. Guadalupe is part of Ensenada &quot;delegación&quot;, one of the 24 &quot;delegaciones&quot; or subdivisions of Ensenada Municipality of the Mexican state of Baja California. Ensenada &quot;delegación&quot; and Chapultepec &quot;delegación&quot; together form the city of Ensenada, the municipal seat of the namesake municipality. The postal code of Guadalupe Island is 22997.

&quot;Campo Oeste&quot; (&quot;West Camp&quot;, also called &quot;Campo Tepeyac&quot;, with 15 buildings) is a small community of abalone and lobster fishermen, located on the western coast, specifically on the north side of West Anchorage, a bay that provides protection from the strong winds and swells that whip the islands during winter. Generators provide electricity, and a military vessel brings of freshwater. The number of fishermen varies annually depending on the fishing season. Ten months of the year the 30 families of the fishing cooperative &quot;&quot;Abuloneros&quot; and &quot;Langosteros&quot; of Guadalupe Island&quot; are present.

Additional temporary fishing camps are &quot;Campo Norte&quot; (&quot;North Camp&quot;, four buildings), &quot;Campo Lima&quot; (&quot;Campo Corrals&quot;) (one building) and &quot;Arroyitos&quot; (four buildings).

At the southern tip, on Melpómene Cove, there is a weather station staffed by a detachment from the Mexican Ministry of the Navy. The site is called &quot;Campamento Sur&quot; (&quot;South Encampment&quot;).

&quot;Campo Bosque&quot; was established as a temporary camp in 1999 in the cypress forest in the north. The camp houses members of the Cooperative Farming Society &quot;Francisco Javier Maytorena, S.C. of R.L.&quot; and removes goats from the island and sells them in the State of Sonora, with permission of Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and the support of the Secretariat of the Navy.

&quot;Campo Pista&quot; is located at the small airport, near the center of the island (, elevation: 592 m, direction: 05/23). Airport &quot;Isla Guadalupe&quot; (ICAO Code &quot;MMGD&quot;) has a runway. At the end of the runway near threshold 5 is the wreckage of a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, which overshot the runway during landing. A North American B-25J-30/32 Mitchell, BMM-3501 (c/n 44-86712), bomber wrecked on the opposite end of the runway, after suffering serious damage in trying to take-off overloaded (). The B-25 wreckage was removed between October 2005 and June 2006.

Because Guadalupe Island is located within a biosphere reserve, anyone visiting the island must obtain a permit from the Mexican government; this means the communities on the island are closed towns.

==Geology==

Guadalupe Island has a rugged landscape composed of two shield volcanoes which formed on a now extinct mid-ocean ridge. They are overlain by lava flows and cinder cones that were emplaced along northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest trending fissure vents. The youngest shield volcano comprises the northern end of the island and may have formed during the Holocene epoch. A series of very fresh-looking alkali basalt flows along with trachyte domes in the northern shield volcano caldera represent the most recently formed rocks on Guadalupe Island.

==Geography==
The island measures north-south and up to east-west, with a total area of . It features a chain of high volcanic mountain ridges which rises to a height of at its northern end (Mount Augusta). Its smaller counterpart on the southern end is the El Picacho. The southern part of the island is mostly barren, but there are scattered stands of trees at higher elevations of the northern part of the island and in the Twin Canyon area on the northeast coast. The coast generally consists of rocky bluffs with detached rocks fronting some of them. Two high and prominent islets are within of the southwestern end of the island, separated from one another by a gap called Tuna Alley:
* Islote Afuera (&quot;Outer Islet&quot;, also &quot;Islote Zapato&quot;), , , the most distant, steep with almost vertical walls above and below water
* Islote Adentro (&quot;Inner Islet&quot;, also &quot;El Toro&quot;), , , with two smaller islets nearby:
** Church Rock
** Roca del Skip

Elsewhere, the other islets are very small and close to the shore, all less than away:
* Islote Negro, , , to the southwest
* Roca Hundida, , , to the southwest
* Islote Bernal, , , to the southwest
* Palto Muerto, , , north of Islote Bernal
* unnamed islet, , , north of Islote Bernal
* Steamboat Rock, , to the west
* Roca Elefante, , to the northwest (the westernmost)
** Roca Elefante is the westernmost point in both Mexico and Latin America.

===Climate===
The island has two major climate zones: a very arid, warm climate between elevation, with mean monthly temperature between and an arid, temperate climate above elevation.

Most precipitation occurs over the winter months with a strong influence of northwestern winds and cyclones.

Rainfall averages near sea level at the south end, but appears to be much more at the high north end. An estimate for the rainfall in the northern highlands is possible by way of taking &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; as an indicator, which is native to that area of the island. In other places where &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; is native, it grows best with about of rainfall but under some conditions can survive with as little as half that much. The effective moisture is much greater because of fog drip.

==Ecology==


Guadalupe Island was a major destination for Russian and American fur hunters seeking the Guadalupe fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus townsendi&quot;) in the 18th and 19th centuries. Captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly reported in 1827 that a Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) brig &quot;had spent several months there and collected three thousand sealskins&quot;. The northern elephant seal (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) was also ruthlessly hunted for the oil in its blubber.

Northern elephant seals were thought to be extinct by 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, which promptly killed several of them for their collections. The northern elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922.

Guadalupe shares the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion with the Channel Islands of California in the United States, but the island was at one time practically denuded of all plants higher than a few centimeters by up to 100,000 feral goats.

Originally brought to the island in the 19th century by European whalers and sealers for provisions when stopping over, the population eventually eliminated most vegetation; the number of feral goats declined to a few thousand. Before this collapse, the main impact of the feral goat population was about the turn of the 19th/20th century. Naturalist A. W. Anthony wrote in 1901:
&quot;It is directly due to the despised Billy-goat that many interesting species of plants formerly abundant are now extinct, and also that one or more of the birds peculiar to the island has disappeared, and others are following rapidly.&quot;

After the crash, the feral goat population once again grew, this time more slowly, until it had reached the new, lower carrying capacity at maybe 10,000–20,000 in modern times. The island had been a nature conservancy area since August 16, 1928, making it one of the oldest reserves in Mexico. Extirpation of the feral goats was long envisioned, but logistical difficulties, such as island size and lack of suitable spots for landing and encamping hunters and material, prevented this. In 2002, the Mexican government (including SEMARNAT) and the conservation group &quot;Grupo de Ecología y Conservación de Islas&quot; began extirpating the feral goats. In June 2005, after many years of false starts, the Mexican government had almost completed a round-up and evacuation of the remaining feral goat population. In 2007, the feral goat extirpation program ended (10,000 feral goats were extirpated). Guadalupe Island was designated a biosphere reserve on April 25, 2005.

French sea captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly remarked on the tall trees on the north of Guadalupe Island as he sailed past on January 2, 1827. Of the four large tree species on Guadalupe Island (the Guadalupe palm, Guadalupe cypress, island oak, and Monterey pine), there were only old individuals left; the California juniper population had entirely disappeared. As the feral goats ate any seedlings that managed to germinate, no regeneration of trees was possible. Water, formerly plentiful as the common fogs condensed in the forests of the northern end of the island, today only occurs in a few scattered pools and springs. Because the springs were a critical emergency water supply for the human inhabitants, protective measures including feral goat fences were installed beginning in 2000, allowing new seedlings of many species to survive for the first time in 150 years. Seacology, a non-profit environmental group located in Berkeley, CA, provided funding to the Island Conservation &amp; Ecology Group for the construction of 10 fenced exclosures to keep feral goats out of the most sensitive areas of Guadalupe Island.

In November 1850, U.S. Army Lt. George H. Derby passed the island on his expedition in the U.S. Transport &quot;Invincible&quot;. He described it thus: &quot;This island is about 15 miles length and 5 in width. It is rocky + mountainous but capped with vegetation and is reputed to be thickly inhabited by wild goats of unusual size. Water is found upon the eastern shore and the Island is frequently visited by small vessels engaged in the capture of the sea elephant numbers of which animals are found upon its coast.&quot;

Many islands or marine species that reside on or near Guadalupe also frequent the Channel Islands, and vice versa. In stark contrast to the rampant extinction of terrestrial life that happened at the same time, Guadalupe was the last refuge for the northern elephant seal (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) and the Guadalupe fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus townsendi&quot;) in the 1890s. The island has been a pinniped sanctuary since 1975.

The movement of the cool, nutrient-rich water current promotes phytoplankton production and attracts both coastal and deep-water species, including spanish mackerel, yellowfin tuna and great white sharks.

Guadalupe is considered one of the best spots in the world for sightings of the great white shark (&quot;Carcharhodon carcharias&quot;), because of its clear water and large population of pinnipeds, their primary prey. Because of the aggregation of over 350 identified white sharks, the island has hosted a recreational cage diving industry from one boat in 2005, to as many as eight operators in 2019, bringing thousands of shark enthusiasts to the island. In 2019 the Mexican Department SEMARNANT suspended cage diving and sport fishing between May and December to evaluate tourism’s impact on the several hundred protected white sharks congregating there. The Mexican Government said the closure was intended to gather information to adopt the best sustainability practices that guarantee their conservation. As of January 10, 2023, cage diving with great white sharks at Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, is permanently prohibited. The Mexican Government’s ban covers all tourism inside the reserve, including film production and liveaboard diving.

The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

===Habitat types===
Before the extirpation of the feral goats, surveys found eight major land habitats on Guadalupe:


# Flora of the coastal lowlands and rocky cliffs: mainly up to above mean sea level (ASL), but higher on the steep cliffs. Largely unresearched due to difficult access, the cliffs might even harbor remnant specimens of the presumably extinct plants.
# Succulent perennial herbs: ASL, chiefly on the southern end and on the offshore islets, and in less steep areas towards sea level. Here, the highest number of endemic plants exist. &quot;Baeriopsis guadalupensis&quot;, &quot;Cistanthe guadalupensis&quot;, &quot;Dudleya guadalupensis&quot;, &quot;Hemizonia greeneana&quot; ssp. &quot;greeneana&quot;, &quot;H. palmeri&quot;, &quot;Nesothamnus incanus&quot;, and &quot;Stephanomeria guadalupensis&quot; are dominant endemics, and giant coreopsis (&quot;Coreopsis gigantea&quot;), a non-endemic native species, is also abundant.
# Arid maritime shrubland: ASL. Mainly in the southern portion around El Picacho. Native species occurring here include &quot;Ambrosia camphorata&quot;, &quot;Atriplex barclayana&quot;, &quot;Cylindropuntia prolifera&quot; and California boxthorn (&quot;Lycium californicum&quot;); none of these is endemic.
# Herbland dominated by introduced plants: ASL, mainly on the central plateau. This habitat is almost entirely a consequence of overgrazing; hardly anything of the original ecosystem remains. Dominant introduced plants are &quot;Avena barbata&quot;, &quot;Bromus berteroanus&quot;, great brome (&quot;B. diandrus&quot;), soft brome (&quot;B. hordeaceus&quot; sspp. &quot;hordaceus&quot; and &quot;mollis&quot;), red brome (&quot;B. madritensis&quot; ssp. &quot;rubens&quot;), tocalote (&quot;Centaurea melitensis&quot;), nettle-leaved goosefoot (&quot;Chenopodium murale&quot;), &quot;Filago californica&quot;, wall barley (&quot;Hordeum murinum&quot; sspp. &quot;glaucum&quot; and &quot;leporinum&quot;), crystalline iceplant (&quot;Mesembryanthemum crystallinum&quot;), &quot;M. nodiflorum&quot;, &quot;Polypogon monspeliensis&quot; and &quot;Sisymbrium orientale&quot;. The non-endemic natives dwarf coastweed (&quot;Amblyopappus pusillus&quot;), island false bindweed (&quot;Calystegia macrostegia&quot; ssp. &quot;macrostegia&quot;), &quot;Cryptantha maritima&quot; var. &quot;maritima&quot;, &quot;Filago arizonica&quot;, &quot;Gilia nevinii&quot;, California goldfields (&quot;Lasthenia californica&quot;), &quot;Pectocarya palmeri&quot; and &quot;Perityle emoryi&quot; as well as the endemics &quot;Cryptantha foliosa&quot; and &quot;Sphaeralcea palmeri&quot; can be found here also; some are still numerous. This probably was a mesic shrub/herbland before the goats destroyed the upland forest, upsetting the water supply. Native plants still found on Guadalupe, like &quot;Crossosoma californicum&quot;, laurel sumac (&quot;Malosma laurina&quot;) and the endemic &quot;Camissonia guadalupensis&quot; ssp. &quot;guadalupensis&quot;, presumably thrived here in former times, as would have such taxa as the native hoary-leaved ceanothus (&quot;Ceanothus crassifolius&quot;), wedge-leaved ceanothus (&quot;C. cuneatus&quot;) – and possibly also felt-leaved ceanothus (&quot;C. arboreus&quot;), which was found in 2001–2003 surveys –, &quot;Cammisonia robusta&quot;, red-flowering currant (&quot;Ribes sanguineum&quot;) and the endemic &quot;Hesperelaea palmeri&quot;, which have now disappeared from the island.
# Guadalupe palm groves: ASL on the northwest side of the island. There are hundreds of palm trees remaining, mainly in a single patch of this habitat. At least one other major palm forest existed at the western coast; it was still present in 1906 at &quot;Steamer Point&quot;. As reproduction is presumably still ongoing, the species will likely recover in due time.
# Guadalupe cypress forest: ASL. Presently some 4,000 old trees, essentially limited to the central-northern part. Other cypress forests, such as a major stand NE of the present patch which was still extant in 1906, were destroyed by the goats early in the 20th century. There is still reproduction, but the water table appears to have declined to below the level required by the cypresses, and mortality of the old trees is high and can be expected to continue even after the removal of the goats.
# Guadalupe palm – island oak – Monterey pine woodland: ASL. This habitat has all but disappeared during the 20th century, due to the decline in numbers of the oaks and pines.
# Guadalupe pine cloud forest with some island oak: restricted to above ASL on the N-NE point of the island. The population of the pine has declined by about two-thirds during the last 35 years; it presently stands at about 130 old trees in the main population and about the same number scattered elsewhere. Reproduction is ongoing, with several hundred seedlings having successfully established themselves since 2000, and with the elimination of goat browsing, the pines will likely make a full recovery. The situation of the oak is direr; there are only 20 trees or so remaining (by about 1950, there were 100) and they appear past reproductive age. Not being restricted to Guadalupe, seedlings could be imported from elsewhere.

A ninth habitat type, California juniper woodland and extending on the central plateau below the cypress forest, was entirely gone by 1906. What other endemic lifeforms underwent coextinction with it will forever remain unknown.

===Extinctions===
Numerous taxa have gone extinct due to the habitat destruction by the feral goats, which in turn rendered the endemic fauna vulnerable to predation by introduced feral cats and adverse weather by depriving them of shelter.

There have been 5–6 extinctions of birds:
* Guadalupe Bewick&#x27;s wren (&quot;Thryomanes bewickii brevicauda&quot;), the late 1890s
* Guadalupe spotted towhee (&quot;Pipilo maculatus consobrinus&quot;), the late 1890s
* Guadalupe caracara (&quot;Caracara lutosa&quot;), 1906 – intentionally made extinct by humans, ironically because it occasionally preyed on young goats
* Guadalupe red-shafted flicker (&quot;Colaptes auratus rufipileus&quot;), 1906 – the island was later recolonized by individuals of an extant mainland red-shafted northern flicker subspecies (which one is unknown)
* Guadalupe storm petrel (&quot;Hydrobates macrodactyla&quot;), the 1910s
* Guadalupe ruby-crowned kinglet (&quot;Corthylio calendula obscurus&quot;) – close to extinction (if, indeed, it still exists); it was not observed in 2000, despite thorough searches

Globally extinct plant taxa from Guadalupe Island are:
* &quot;Castilleja guadalupensis&quot;
* &quot;Hesperelaea palmeri&quot;
* &quot;Pogogyne tenuiflora&quot;
and one species of plant &quot;incertae sedis&quot;

<text>Ernesto Camillo Sivori (June 6, 1817February 18, 1894) was an Italian virtuoso violinist and composer.

== Life ==
Early life 

Born in Genoa, he was the only known pupil of Niccolò Paganini. He also studied with Antonio Restano (1790–1885), (1760s or 70s-~1865?) and Agostino Dellepiane.

From 1827 Sivori began the career of a travelling virtuoso, which lasted almost without interruption until 1864. On November 18, 1846, he performed at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston, where he played Il Campanello and Carnival of Venice. He played Mendelssohn&#x27;s concerto for the first time in England in 1846, and was in England again in the seasons of 1851 and 1864. In 1864, he formed a permanent trio with cellist Alfredo Piatti and pianist Charlotte Tardieu. 

Camillo Sivori also collaborated with Giuseppe Verdi. In 1893 Verdi heard Sivori performed at his private music soiree and noted Sivori&#x27;s impeccable technique, agility and musicianship. Sivori&#x27;s performances ideas were directly influenced by Opera characters. His violin techniques, in many instances were executed to impersonate human sounds. &quot;Le Stregghe&quot; is one of his best examples in which his unique ability to create such lively, almost cinematographic effects is achieved. Sivori understood that he was the only violinist alive (in the late 1800s) who could immortalize Paganini&#x27;s art of violin playing and unique Operatic interpretations. The school of violin playing was rapidly changing and Paganini&#x27;s art was rapidly forgotten. He lived for many years in Paris, and died in Genoa on February 19, 1894.

He collaborated with composers of his day, including Franz Liszt. He played the first performance of Luigi Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in E minor.

He owned many valuable instruments, including violins by Amati, Antonio Stradivari, Carlo Bergonzi, Gaetano Chiocchi, and Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume.

Sivori&#x27;s favourite violin was the Vuillaume violin, which he received as a gift from Paganini. It was an impeccably close copy of Paganini&#x27;s famous Cannone Guarnerius. This violin is owned by the Musei Di Genova and displayed in their Palazzo Tursi.

Sivori was known to adapt many peculiar pieces such that he could play them, and many of these pieces, once thought absurd, have now become quite popular. However, Giovanni Bottesini&#x27;s Gran Duo Concertante, which was a double concerto originally written for two double basses alternating the melody, was not one of these. Although Sivori played it many times as a duo with Bottesini, the version for violin and double bass, had been made much earlier.

== Personal life ==
Sivori married in 1855 the French comedic actress Hortense Damain (d.1881)

<text>Steven Lawrence Rattner (born July 5, 1952) is an American investor, media commentator, and former journalist. He is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Willett Advisors, the private investment firm that manages billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s personal and philanthropic assets. He began his career as an economic reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; before moving to a career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and Lazard Freres &amp; Co., where he rose to deputy chairman and deputy chief executive officer. He then became a managing principal of the Quadrangle Group, a private equity investment firm that specialized in the media and communications industries. 

In 2009, Rattner was named lead adviser to the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry. He has also been an economic analyst for MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Morning Joe&quot;, and as a contributing opinion writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed page. 

==Early life and education==
Rattner was born to a Jewish family in Great Neck, New York, the son of Selma and George Rattner. His father was the president of a small paint company and a playwright who produced several Off-Broadway plays; his mother was an architecture preservationist and vice president of the Victorian Society of America. He attended local public schools in Great Neck. Rattner received his A.B. with honors in economics from Brown University in 1974 and was awarded the Harvey Baker Fellowship. While at Brown, he served as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; in 1973.

==Journalism career==
Upon graduating from Brown, Rattner was hired in Washington, D.C., as a news clerk to James Reston, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist and former executive editor. After a year, he moved to New York as a reporter to cover business and energy; there he became friends with colleague Paul Goldberger. In 1977, he was transferred back to Washington to cover the energy crisis.

At age 27 he became the paper&#x27;s chief Washington economic correspondent. He became close friends with Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who was then the &quot;Times&quot; publisher. He concluded his service to &quot;The New York Times&quot; with two years in London as its European economic correspondent.

==Investment banking career==
At the end of 1982, Rattner left &quot;The New York Times&quot; and was recruited by Roger Altman to join the investment bank Lehman Brothers as an associate. After Lehman was sold to American Express in 1984, he followed his boss Eric Gleacher and several colleagues to Morgan Stanley, where he founded the firm&#x27;s communications group. In 1989, after Morgan Stanley filed for an initial public offering, he joined Lazard as a general partner and with Lazard colleagues advised on numerous deals for large media conglomerates such as Viacom and Comcast. Alongside Felix Rohatyn, Rattner became Lazard&#x27;s top rainmaker in the 1990s. Michel David-Weill named him the firm&#x27;s deputy chairman and deputy chief executive in 1997.

==Private equity career==
In March 2000, Rattner and three Lazard partners, including Joshua Steiner, left the firm and founded the Quadrangle Group. They initially focused on investing a $1 billion media-focused private equity fund. Early investors in Quadrangle included Sulzberger, and Mort Zuckerman. Headquartered in the Seagram Building, Quadrangle grew to manage more than $6 billion across several business lines, including private equity, distressed securities, and hedge funds. The firm also hosted an annual gathering for media executives called Foursquare, where speakers included Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. In 2008, the firm&#x27;s asset management division was selected to invest the personal and philanthropic assets of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Rattner&#x27;s close friend.

Throughout his business career, Rattner has served on several corporate boards, including Cablevision, IAC/InterActiveCorp, and Protection One.

==Public service==

During his tenure with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in Washington D.C., Rattner developed an interest in economic policy, drawing him to politics and public service. In the mid-1990s, he began to work actively on behalf of Democratic candidates, beginning with President Bill Clinton. In 2008, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that he had long aspired to a cabinet position.

In February 2009, with General Motors and Chrysler insolvent, Rattner was appointed counselor to the United States Secretary of the Treasury and lead auto adviser, a role informally referred to in the media as the &quot;car czar&quot;. He soon assembled a team that grew to 14 professionals to address the financial problems of the two auto companies.

Reporting to both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers, the head of the National Economic Council, Rattner&#x27;s team developed a plan to save both the two manufacturers and related suppliers and finance companies. The plan involved a government investment of $82 billion in the sector, coupled with controlled bankruptcies for the two auto companies, as well as new management for both, and the closure of 2,000 automobile dealerships and loss of tens of thousands of related jobs. A White &amp; Case lawyer claimed that Rattner had threatened the reputation of Perella Weinberg if they continued to oppose the controlled bankruptcies; however Parella Weinberg denied this claim and &quot;The New York Times&quot; found that Rattner had never spoken with the lawyer who made the claim.

Rattner later stated that the toughest decision for President Obama about the two auto companies was whether to save Chrysler. There was, however, no disagreement about asking GM CEO Richard Wagoner to step aside.

By July 2009, both automakers had emerged from bankruptcy, had new management and were on their way to profitability. At that time, Rattner left Washington and returned to private life in New York.

==Post-political career==
After leaving the government, Rattner wrote &quot;Overhaul: An Insider&#x27;s Account of the Obama Administration&#x27;s Emergency Auto Rescue&quot;, his account of the automotive industry crisis of 2008-2010.

He has continued to speak publicly on auto-related matters as well as broader economic issues. Early in 2011, he began contributing a monthly column to the Financial Times on subjects ranging from the Greek crisis to the U.S. budget deficit. He also became the economic analyst for the MSNBC news show, &quot;Morning Joe&quot;. And in June 2011, he was named a contributing writer to The New York Times Op-Ed page, publishing his first column on how government policies drive up corn prices.

He is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Willett Advisors, the private investment group that manages billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s personal and philanthropic assets.

==New York pension fund investigation and settlements==
In 2005, Quadrangle retained private placement agent Hank Morris to help Quadrangle raise money for its second buyout fund. Morris had come highly recommended to Rattner from U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. Morris was the chief political advisor to Alan Hevesi, the New York State Comptroller and manager of the New York State Common Retirement Fund (CRF), which invests in many private equity funds. Morris told Rattner he could increase the size of the CRF investment in Quadrangle&#x27;s second buyout fund. Rattner agreed to pay Morris a placement fee of 1.1% of any investments greater than $25 million from the CRF.

In 2009, Quadrangle and other investment firms were investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their arrangements with Morris. The SEC viewed the payments as &quot;kickbacks&quot; in order to receive investments from the CRF since Morris was also the chief political advisor to Hevesi. Quadrangle paid $7 million in April 2010 to settle the SEC investigation, and Rattner personally settled in November for $6.2 million without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.

The case drew significant media attention when the office of Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Attorney General, also sought penalties from Rattner. Rattner has been a major fundraiser for Democratic Party candidates including Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.

In an appearance on the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot;, Rattner asserted that hiring Morris as a placement agent was &quot;legal then, legal now, and done properly.&quot; He explained he was willing to settle with the SEC, but questioned whether Cuomo was motivated by the &quot;facts&quot; of the case and called his settlement demands &quot;close to extortion.&quot;

On December 30, 2010, Rattner settled with the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office by agreeing to pay $10 million in restitution. As part of the settlement, Rattner was barred from appearing before a public pension fund in any capacity for five years. Rattner did not admit any wrongdoing and continued to assert his innocence.

==Personal==
In 1986, Rattner married Maureen White in an interfaith service at the Lotos Club in Manhattan. They have four children. , Rattner and his wife own homes on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. They also own a horse farm in North Salem, New York.

Rattner has served as a board member or trustee of a number of civic and philanthropic organizations, including the Educational Broadcasting Corporation as chairman, Mayor&#x27;s Fund to Advance New York City as chairman, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Brown University, Brookings Institution and the New America Foundation. Rattner is also member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Rattner supported various educational and cultural institutions through the Rattner Family Foundation, including the Sesame Workshop, Harvard Law School, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and others. White served for five years as finance chair for the Democratic National Committee and then as a senior advisor on humanitarian issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan for the U.S. Department of State.

<text>Goyang KB Kookmin Bank Football Club () was a South Korean football club based in the Seoul satellite city of Goyang. It played in the National League, the third tier of Korean football. The club was officially dissolved in November 2012.

== K-League Membership ==
Kookmin Bank FC was founded in September 1969 and competed in the various amateur football competitions at the time. The club enjoyed success in tournaments such as the Korea Semi-Professional Football League (winners in 1978) and the President&#x27;s Cup (winners in 1978 and 1983) before becoming founder members of the K-League, the professional football league in South Korea, in 1983.

The club&#x27;s stay in the professional ranks was a short one, as it finished 5th out of the five teams in the first year. When it came in 8th out of the eight teams in 1984 the decision was made for the club to return to the amateur ranks.

== After the K-League ==
Upon returning to the amateur ranks, the club returned to winning ways and managed President&#x27;s Cup triumphs in 1986, 1990 and 1995. It also won the 3rd edition of the Industrial Amateur Football championship in 1993, a tournament they would win again in 1996.

The financial crisis that struck South Korea in 1997 saw the club temporarily wound up, with the official decision to pull the plug on the team coming on December 31, 1997. After two years out of the game, Kookmin Bank reconstituted their club on February 28, 2000 and the team returned to the amateur ranks, eventually winning a sixth President&#x27;s Cup crown in 2003.

== Life at K2 Level ==
Organised league football at amateur level came about in 2003 with the establishment of the National League, a competition with ten members, of which Kookmin Bank were one. Initially based in Gimpo, the club won the first stage of the 2003 championship and then moved its home base to Goyang and the team&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Goyang Kookmin Bank&quot; for the second stage where they finished runners-up on goal difference. They defeated the reserve team of military side Sangmu 5–4 on aggregate in the playoff final to win the league. They retained their championship crown in 2004 with a 4–1 aggregate win over Gangneung City FC after having again won the first stage of the league season.

Despite a lacklustre 2005 season, the club bounced back to win the 2006 championship (now rebranded the &quot;National League&quot;], triumphing 2–1 on aggregate in the final after winning the first stage of the season.

== Promotion Controversy ==
It was planned that, subject to meeting certain financial requirements, the winner of the National League in 2006 would be promoted to the K-League. However Goyang Kookmin Bank caused controversy by winning the league but declining to move up. Team owners Kookmin Bank cited a Korean law where banks in Korea were not allowed to be involved in profitable ventures outside of banking which of course a professional football team could be. However the more likely reason is the large financial losses that most K-League teams endure each year as the league struggles for sponsorship money and suffers through low crowd numbers. On top of that any National League champion seeking promotion from the second tier is required to pay an &#x27;entry fee&#x27; of around 2 million US dollars simply to join the league. Goyang Kookmin Bank received several threats from the League ranging from being thrown out of the competition, to fines, to point deductions for the upcoming 2007 season. In the end the side received a points deduction penalty, to be split into ten point deductions in the first and second stages of the 2007 season.

<text>Wandervogel (plural: Wandervögel; English: &quot;Wandering Bird&quot;) is the name adopted by a popular movement of German youth groups from 1896 to 1933, who protested against industrialization by going to hike in the country and commune with nature in the woods. Drawing influence from medieval wandering scholars, their ethos was to revive old Teutonic values, with a strong emphasis on German nationalism. According to historians, a major contribution of the &quot;Wandervögel&quot; was the revival of folk songs in wider German society.

The movement was divided into three main national groups: the &quot;Alt-Wandervogel&quot;, the &quot;Wandervogel eingetragener Verein&quot; (WVEV) and the &quot;Jung-Wandervogel&quot;. While the two first ones were generally respectful of traditions (family, the military, the school), the &quot;Jung-Wandervogel&quot; was more defiant and closer to revolutionary ideas. Wandervögel spontaneously emerged outside of authority controls, and recruited their members through selection and co-option.

Wandervogel was the dominant trend in the German Youth Movement between 1901 and 1913. From 100 members in 1901, they numbered 25,000 to 40,000 adherents in 1914. At its height, the movement had 60,000–80,000 members, with 45,000 in the WVEV alone. The name, referring to a magical, free and weightless bird, can be translated either as a &quot;bird of passage&quot;, or as a &quot;wandering bird&quot;, slightly different in meaning from the &quot;Zugvogel&quot; (&quot;migratory bird&quot;).

==History==
=== Origin (1895–1900) ===
In the autumn of 1895, a law student named Hermann Hoffmann-Fölkersamb (1875–1955) received permission from the director of the Steglitz &quot;Gymnasium&quot; to offer free stenography classes. By 1896, these classes included walks around Steglitz, and in 1897 the group undertook a 15-day hike through the Harz highlands. The small gathering soon grew in size, organizing a trek in the Rhine region in 1898 with 11 participants, followed in 1899 by a four-week excursion in Bohemia with around 20 schoolboys. Even in these early outings, the core elements of the future Wandervogel were already apparent: an emphasis on the group&#x27;s independence and a frugal way of life, a rejection of traditional authority, a scorn for tourist-friendly, well-marked trails, and a disregard for the comforts offered by youth hostels.

=== First Wandervogel (1901–1904) ===
The Wandervogel was officially founded on November 4, 1901, by Karl Fischer (1881–1941) in Steglitz—a suburb of Berlin—under the name &quot;Wandervogel Committee for Schoolboy Excursions&quot; (&quot;Wandervogel, Ausschuß für Schülerfahrten&quot;). Fischer formed the committee with four of his friends, along with four local writers and a physician. This group functioned as a legal and financial sponsor, but they did not participate in the movement&#x27;s activities, which were directed by Fischer himself under the title &quot;Oberbachant&quot;. At the time, Prussian law prohibited young people from establishing their own clubs or joining extracurricular groups. Fischer therefore presented the new association to parents and Prussian authorities as a respectable hiking club. A former teacher at the Steglitz &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, the reform pedagogue Ludwig Gurlitt (1855–1931), helped secure official recognition from the Prussian Ministry of Culture by submitting a positive report. Fischer had been a devoted follower of Hoffmann-Fölkersamb, his right-hand man on numerous treks, and he eventually assumed leadership when Hoffmann-Fölkersamb left Berlin at the end of 1899 to pursue a diplomatic career in Constantinople. After failing his &quot;Abitur&quot; (school-leaving exams) twice, Fischer had to wait until 1901 to devote himself fully to the movement, at the expense of his studies in law and Sinology. By 1903, Wandervogel groups had already formed in Berlin, Posen, Munich, Hamburg and Lüneburg, and they were regularly organizing hikes.

The Wandervögel quickly rose to prominence as the leading German youth movement. Rooted in a back-to-nature philosophy, the group championed freedom, self-reliance, and a spirit of adventure. Before long, however, it also adopted a nationalist tone, emphasizing Germany&#x27;s Teutonic heritage. Walter Laqueur indicates that the name was discovered by one of the founders—Wolf Meyen—in an inscription on a tombstone: &quot;Wer hat euch Wandervögeln / die Wissenschaft geschenkt / dass ihr auf Land und Meeren / die Flügel sicher lenkt&quot; (&quot;Who granted you, wandering birds / the knowledge / so that over land and sea / you guide your wings so surely?&quot;). Drawing influence from medieval wandering students, the newcomers were named &quot;Scholars&quot; and the proven ones &quot;Bachant&quot;. Fischer introduced new manners such as the greeting &quot;Heil&quot;, inspired by Austrian German students; musical instruments were carried out during hikes, especially the lute guitar, alongside clothing, food, and a &quot;hiking stick&quot;.

=== Divisions and expansion (1904–1913) ===
In June 1904, opposition led by Siegfried Copalle grew against Karl Fischer in the original Wandervogel group. They debated on social issues: abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and if females should be allowed to join the movement as equals. As a result, the Copalle group became the &quot;Wandervogel-Steglitz&quot;, presided by Ludwig Gurlitt, while followers of Fischer founded the &quot;Alt-Wandervogel&quot;. The &quot;Wandervogel-Steglitz&quot; banned alcohol from excursions and removed the &quot;Oberbachant&quot; position in order to establish a collegial direction (&quot;Führerkollegium&quot;). It was geographically limited to the surroundings of Berlin and in 1912, the year of its dissolution, it had only 200 &quot;members&quot;, along with 440 students who participated in the group&#x27;s activities.

The &quot;Alt-Wandervogel&quot; saw itself as the only legitimate inheritor of the original movement, as it was under the responsibility of Karl Fischer, now &quot;Großbachant&quot;. But after a new leadership crisis emerged in 1905, Fischer left both the movement and Germany during the following year. He eventually came back to his home country only 15 years later. After his departure, the &quot;Alt-Wandervögel&quot; quickly abandoned the previous authoritarian structure centered around Fischer to adopt an organization closer to the Steglitz group&#x27;s. It experienced from then on a strong rise in membership.
In 1907, a new crisis broke out in the &quot;Alt-Wandervogel&quot;, led by another opponent of alcohol, Ferdinand Vetter from Jena. The Vetter group eventually seceded to found the &quot;Wandervogel&quot;, &quot;Deutscher Bund für Jugendwandern&quot; (WVDB). Largely decentralized, the autonomous structures were connected via annual meetings and a common magazine. The Wandervogel DB was endorsed by cultural groups like the Dürerbund, and by German pro-temperance leagues. This wing was particularly active in the publication of folk song collections. They also tried to reunite the different Wandervogel wings under a common agenda of alcohol prohibition, the admission of girls, and the enlargement of membership to primary school students and apprentices. After several compromises—notably the autonomy of each group in the application of policies, comparable to the situation of German states in the Empire—they eventually succeeded in creating the &quot;Wandervogel eingetragener Verein, Bund für deutsches Jugendwandern&quot; (WVEV) at the end of 1912. The WVEV was joined by the &quot;Wandervogel-Steglitz&quot; in December 1912, by the WVDB in January 1913, as well as two-thirds of the &quot;Alt-Wandervögel&quot;.

The &quot;Alt-Wandervögel&quot; who chose to remain claimed to represent the tradition of Fischer, by refusing any compromise with the adult world. By 1914, they numbered 4,400 adherents, and 6,000 &quot;Scholaren&quot;. While reminding the &quot;German nature of the Wandervogel&quot;, they let each group decide on the question of Jewish membership; the WVEV applied the same policy. In 1912, a Jewish girl was refused membership in Zittau because, it was argued, the Wandervogel was a &quot;German movement&quot; that had no use for a Jew. One Wandervogel newspaper, &quot;Führer Zeitung&quot;, asserted that &quot;the Wandervogel is neither a depository for old boots formerly worn by flat-footed [Jews] and stinking of garlic nor is it an object of speculation for Jewish enterprises.&quot; The readings of Paul de Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain were also standard among Wandervögel.

By 1910, some directors of the &quot;Alt-Wandervogel&quot; had denounced the homosexuality of their colleague Wilhelm Jansen, who eventually seceded to create the &quot;Jung-Wandervogel&quot; split group in the same year. This was the smallest of the three main Wandervogel wings, with 2,300 members in 1913. They attacked in their rhetoric the &quot;mentally constricting&quot; adult institutions, claiming that the purpose of the &quot;Wandervögel&quot; was to allow young people to &quot;discuss all their wishes and values&quot; without the interference of adults. Influenced by Hans Blüher, they dismissed the movement as too conformist and respectable, considering it had lost its soul. This situation was caused in their views by the growing influence of adults via the Council of parents and friends (&quot;Eufrat&quot;), the interventions of teachers in their activities, and a rise in membership that had become out of control. The Freideutsche Jugend was founded on Hoher Meissner in October 1913 on the basis of autonomy from adult supervision.

The &quot;Jung-Wandervögel&quot; also became known for the prevailing homosexuality in their ranks. According to historian Peter Stachura however, if male eroticism &quot;did play some part in the ordinary day-to-day life of the &quot;Wandervögel&quot;, [...] it would be misleading to conclude on this account that the &quot;Wandervogel&quot; was a predominantly homo-erotic movement&quot;.

===WWI and after (1914–1933) ===
=== After the Nazi seizure of power===
From 1933, the Nazis outlawed the &quot;Wandervogel&quot;, German Scouting, the Jungenschaft, and the Bündische Jugend, along with most youth groups independent of the Hitler Youth. Only Church-affiliated groups survived, lasting until almost 1936.

=== Austria and Switzerland ===
The Austrian wing, &quot;Österreichischer Wandervogel&quot; (ÖWV), was established in 1909 by a student from Prague, Hans Moutschka, following first contacts between the Austrian youth and German Wandervögel in Bohemia by 1906. Recruited within the Austrian bourgeoisie, its members were known for their violent rhetoric, and defended German nationalism against the perceived threat of pan-Slavism in Austria-Hungary.

Another branch was created in Switzerland in 1906-1907 after a meeting with German students opposed to alcohol, the &quot;Schweizerischer Wandervogel&quot; (SWV). They had 50 members at their launch in April 1908, and around 1,500 members in 1913. The Swiss movement had a limited impact, and was essentially composed of young German-speaking Protestants from the bourgeoisie.

=== Japan ===
Before World War II, in a context of cordial relations with Germany, and in an effort to promote healthy activities for young people throughout the country, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of education launched the movement among Japanese universities, calling it the . The first WanderVogel student club was created in 1935 in Rikkyo University. It then spread to Keio University and Meiji University, and from 1937 on to several other universities around the country, especially after World War II, in the context of high economic growth and popularization of mountaineering.

== Sociology ==
The movement was mostly based on the German Protestant middle class, attracting only a few working-class and aristocrat members. Boys and girls were allowed to join, although this caused some controversy among leaders, and the introduction of sex segregation in the movement activities. Members were between 12 and 18 years old.

The regions with the largest concentration of Wandervögel were Silesia, Saxony, Thuringia, Hesse, Westphalia, Rhineland; and to a lesser extent Baden. They were largely present in Protestant regions; nearly 80% of the cities hosting a Wandervogel group in 1912 had a strong Protestant majority. Most of those locations were not densely populated and industrialized centres of life, but rather belonged to the rural and traditional part of Germany, with small and medium cities, residential suburbs, university cities, and capitals of small principalities.

The Wandervögel seem to have started an anti-authoritarian rebellion against German society at large, with their focus on the youth values in opposition to the adult ones. The movement was born in Steglitz, a middle-class residential neighbourhood of Berlin. Far from the agitation of the city centre and the working-class districts, young students wanted to escape the social constraints of their environment, which was built on traditional and hierarchical social ranks influencing relations with their parents and the adult society, rather than on poor material conditions. However, the Wandervogel was not a revolutionary movement in the real sense of the term, as they simply withdrew from society in order to carry out their activities in isolation during a few days or a whole summer, before returning to their usual life during the remaining part of the year. Although it could promote anarchist or nihilistic ideas at the margins, especially in the &quot;Jung-Wandervogel&quot;, most of the Wandervögel essentially sought to be seen as a respectable movement in wider society.

==Modern aspects==
The &quot;Wandervogel&quot; movement was refounded after World War II and exists in Germany to this day with around 5,000 members in many different associations, as well as in neighboring countries.

In Japan, it is now a fairly renowned student club with activities like mountaineering, sawanobori and ski touring.

==Influence==

Some authors have seen the ethos and activities of the Wandervögel as an influence on later social movements, in particular the hippie movement which developed in the United States during the 1960s.

<text>The Eve of St. Agnes is a Romantic narrative poem of 42 Spenserian stanzas set in the Middle Ages. It was written by John Keats in 1819 and published in 1820. The poem was considered by many of Keats&#x27;s contemporaries and the succeeding Victorians to be one of his finest and was influential in 19th-century literature.

The title comes from the day (or evening) before the feast of Saint Agnes (or St. Agnes&#x27; Eve). St. Agnes, the patron saint of virgins, died a martyr in 4th-century Rome. The eve falls on 20 January; the feast day on the 21st. The divinations referred to by Keats in this poem are referred to by John Aubrey in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1696) as being associated with St. Agnes&#x27; night.

==Background==
Keats based his poem on the folk belief that a girl could see her future husband in a dream if she performed certain rites on the eve of St. Agnes; that is, she would go to bed without any supper, and transfer pins one by one from a pincushion to a sleeve while reciting the Lord’s Prayer. Then the proposed husband would appear in her dream.

A Scottish version of the ritual would involve young women meeting together on St. Agnes&#x27;s Eve at midnight; they would go, one by one, into a remote field and throw in some grain, after which they repeated the following rhyme in a prayer to St. Agnes: &quot;Agnes sweet, and Agnes fair,
Hither, hither, now repair;
Bonny Agnes, let me see
The lad who is to marry me.&quot;

Keats started writing this seminal work while staying in Chichester. He travelled to Chichester, probably arriving on St. Agnes&#x27; Eve, 20 January 1819. It is said that the medieval architecture of Chichester inspired the great hall and house where Madeline lived. A statue of Keats resides in Eastgate Square in Chichester to commemorate the fact he started this poem there. The statue was unveiled by Chichester-based actress Dame Patricia Routledge. 

In the original version of his poem, Keats emphasised the young lovers&#x27; sexuality, but his publishers, who feared public reaction, forced him to tone down the eroticism.

==Plot==
On a bitterly chill night, an elderly beadsman says his prayers in the chapel of the ancestral home of Madeline&#x27;s family, where a loud party has begun. Madeline pines for the love of Porphyro, sworn enemy to her kin. She has heard &#x27;old dames full many times declare&#x27; that she may receive sweet dreams of her lover if, on this night, St. Agnes&#x27; Eve, she retires to bed following the proper rituals.

Later that night, Porphyro makes his way to the castle and braves entry, seeking out Angela, an elderly woman friendly to his family, and importuning her to lead him to Madeline&#x27;s room at night, where he may but gaze upon her sleeping form. Angela is persuaded only with difficulty, and first obtains some food from the banquet for them.

Concealed in an ornate, carved closet in Madeline&#x27;s room, Porphyro watches as Madeline makes ready for bed. He creeps forth as she sleeps, to prepare a feast of rare delicacies. Madeline wakes and sees before her the same image she has seen in her dream and, thinking Porphyro part of it, receives him into her bed. Waking in full and realising her mistake, she tells Porphyro she cannot hate him for his deception since her heart is so much in his, but that if he goes now he leaves behind &quot;A dove forlorn and lost / With sick unpruned wing&quot;.

Porphyro declares his love for Madeline and promises her a home with him over the southern moors. They flee from the castle, passing insensate, drunken revellers and rush into the night. Angela&#x27;s death is revealed in the poem&#x27;s final stanza and the beadsman, &quot;after thousand aves told, / For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold&quot;.

==Commentary==
Written in the Gothic style, the poem reflects &quot;...many of the same concerns that Keats explores in his odes -- imagination, dreaming and vision, and life as a mixture of opposites.&quot; In it, Keats blends a medieval legend with a tale of star-crossed lovers, such as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and the traditional French romance &quot;Floris and Blancheflour&quot;.

==Alluded to by others==
*Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;Wireless&quot; (1902) has the narrator witnessing a recreation of the poem by a man in a trance who, by virtue of the similarities of his situation to that of Keats (he is a consumptive apothecary&#x27;s assistant), becomes &quot;tuned&quot; to the poet.
*H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Outsider&quot; features the final stanza of the poem as an epigraph.
*Harry Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; is a stained glass masterpiece inspired by the poem.
*Robert Hunter’s &quot;The Silver Snarling Trumpet: The Birth of the Grateful Dead&quot; (2024 [1962]) takes its title from the fourth stanza of Keats’s poem.

<text>Año Nuevo Island (&quot;Año Nuevo&quot; is Spanish for &quot;New Year&quot;) is a small island off Año Nuevo Point on the coast of Northern California, between San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The island has an area of . It is an important breeding site for northern elephant seals and the endangered Steller&#x27;s sea lion, as well as several species of seabirds, including rhinoceros auklets, Brandt&#x27;s cormorants and western gulls. Due to the number of seals and sea lions, great white sharks are frequently spotted patrolling the waters around the island. It is protected as part of the Año Nuevo State Reserve.

Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area and Greyhound Rock State Marine Conservation Area are two adjoining protected marine areas off the coast of Año Nuevo State Park. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems. The waters of Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area surround Año Nuevo Island.

==Geology==
As recently as the 18th century, what is today Año Nuevo Island was a peninsula. It became separated from the mainland by a channel that continues to widen. The island is mainly made up of Miocene shale and deposits from ancient dunes, along with a broad intertidal shelf and low, rocky islets, all of which are frequently altered by the erosive pounding of waves, particularly during winter storms.

==Administration==
Año Nuevo Island is managed by the University of California Natural Reserve System Santa Cruz campus, under an agreement with the California Department of Parks and Recreation. The Año Nuevo Island Reserve, including the island and surrounding waters, comprises 25 of the of the Año Nuevo State Reserve, the rest of which is on the mainland opposite the island.

==Access and facilities==
Access to Año Nuevo Island is restricted to members of approved research teams; the island is closed to the public. The island has a few abandoned buildings built in the late 19th century. A residential home and foghorn station, all abandoned, are located on the island. The original light tower was deliberately toppled early in the first decade of the 21st century as it began to deteriorate and became a hazard to the resident wildlife. Some of the remaining buildings are used as research facilities.

==Restoration==
Año Nuevo Island is a haul-out site for thousands of California sea lions. Over the past several decades, they have caused extensive damage to native plants and auklet burrows. In 2010, a conservation non-profit organization, Oikonos, started a restoration project to reduce sea lion trampling, re-grow native plants, and help the auklet populations.

==In literature==
* &quot;New Year Island&quot; is a 2013 fiction thriller by Paul Draker, set on modern-day Año Nuevo Island.

<text>Mashed pumpkin is a vegetable dish made by cooking or macerating the skinless flesh (pulp) of pumpkins and then mashing, straining, grinding, or puréeing until the desired consistency is achieved. It is traditionally served as a side dish, although it has many uses in cooking and baking.

==History==
The pumpkin is native to North and South America. It was widely cultivated and used for food throughout much of North America by Native Americans, and many tribes on the eastern coast of North America ate mashed pumpkin. Some Native Americans also spread mashed pumpkin over scrapes and cuts as a poultice. Mashed pumpkin was likely served at the 1621 &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot; celebration at Plymouth Colony in America, where members of the Wampanoag tribe celebrated an iconic harvest festival with the Pilgrims. English colonists in New England quickly adopted pumpkin as a food source, and &quot;pumpkin sauce&quot; (mashed pumpkin) was served at inns in New England as early as 1704. Mashed pumpkin was also added to various breads and cakes as a flavoring agent as well as a sweetener. By the mid-18th century, mashed pumpkin was also being used as an ingredient in pies. In the New World Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (modern New York City), mashed pumpkin was mixed with corn meal and fried as a pancake.

==Cooking==
Chefs generally recommend steaming when cooking pumpkin to make mashed pumpkin, as boiling in liquid tends to significantly dilute the flavor. Some chefs recommend fried or roasted pumpkin for its flavor value over mashed pumpkin. But well-seasoned mashed pumpkin goes well with cooked game birds such as quail, and mashed pumpkin sweetened with dark maple syrup is a common New England side dish served alongside roast chicken or baked ham. Mashed pumpkin may also be used as a substitute for fat in many bread and cake recipes.

==Nutritional information==
A single cup of unseasoned mashed pumpkin contains only 49 calories, but has 564 mg of potassium, 5,000 mcg of beta-carotene, 853 mcg of alpha-carotene, 3,500 mcg of beta-cryptoxanthin, 2,400 mcg of lutein and zeaxanthin, 12,000 IUs of vitamin A, and 2.5 g of dietary fiber.

<doc id="1229613" wikidata="Q7409060" url="?curid=1229613" title="Sambo's">
<text>Sambo&#x27;s was an American restaurant chain, started in 1957 by Sam Battistone Sr. and Newell Bohnett in Santa Barbara, California. Though the name was taken from portions of the names of its two founders, the chain also associated with &quot;The Story of Little Black Sambo&quot;. Battistone and Bohnett capitalized on this connection by decorating the walls of the restaurants with scenes from the book, including a dark-skinned boy, tigers, and a pale, magical unicycle-riding man called &quot;The Treefriend&quot;. By the early 1960s, the illustrations depicted a light-skinned boy wearing a jeweled Indian-style turban with the tigers. A kids club, Sambo&#x27;s Tiger Tamers (later called the Tiger Club), promoted the chain&#x27;s family image. The chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1981. All locations except for the first in Santa Barbara either closed outright, or were renamed after being purchased, effectively ending the chain&#x27;s existence.

The Santa Barbara restaurant continued business under the Sambo&#x27;s name until 2020, when it was renamed to Chad&#x27;s after its owner at the time, Chad Stevens. The George Floyd protests against racism in the United States resulted in the owner of the restaurant changing the name of the establishment.

==History==
After the first Sambo&#x27;s was opened in 1957, the restaurant was expanded to more locations. In late 1963, it had restaurants in 16 cities – in California, Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona. By 1969, the company had grown to 98 locations, and over the next two years diversified to create additional restaurant franchises, including Red Top Hamburgers, Heidi&#x27;s Pie Shop, and the Blue Ox Steak House.

In the latter half of the 1970s, pressure began to mount on the chain to change its name, drawing protests and lawsuits in communities that viewed the term &quot;Sambo&quot; as pejorative towards Black Americans. Twelve of its restaurants were opened as or renamed &quot;The Jolly Tiger&quot; in locations where the local community passed resolutions forbidding the use of the original name or refused to grant the chain permits. The last of these restaurants was created in December 1977. In March 1979, the company reversed course on its &quot;Jolly Tiger&quot; restaurants and stated their intent to rename all of them back to Sambo&#x27;s. The company cited poor financial performance of these restaurants; the company&#x27;s &quot;constitutional, legal, and moral right to operate (those restaurants) under its corporate name&quot;; and the assertion that Black people did not object to the name, citing studies that showed that &quot;three times as many blacks [sic] ate at Sambo&#x27;s as at any other full service restaurant&quot;.

In 1979, Sambo&#x27;s had 1,117 outlets in 47 American states. Additional corporate level decisions made at the time also led to Sambo&#x27;s corporate demise. Pressure to take Sambo&#x27;s into a more normal, salaried manager compensation package was one issue. Their unique &quot;Fraction of the Action&quot; promotion – whereby managers were entitled to 20% of the profits from their stores, with employees allowed to bid for a percentage of the remaining profits – was an early company expansion plan, and the growth of the company outpaced its control. In March 1981, in a further attempt to give the chain a new image the company again renamed some locations, this time to &quot;No Place Like Sam&#x27;s&quot;. By November 1981, the company filed for bankruptcy. Neither the name change nor bankruptcy protection reversed this downward trend, and by 1982 all except the original Sambo&#x27;s at 216 West Cabrillo Boulevard in Santa Barbara, California closed their doors. By February 1983, 618 of the locations were renamed Season&#x27;s Friendly Eating. Several locations were sold to Denny&#x27;s, including the Fort Lauderdale store. Bakers Square&#x27;s parent company acquired Sambo&#x27;s in California in October 1984. Many Sambo&#x27;s locations were converted to Bakers Square restaurants and the ones that weren&#x27;t were sold to other chains, including Denny&#x27;s.

Battistone&#x27;s grandson, restaurateur Chad Stevens, owns the only remaining restaurant in Santa Barbara which continued business under the Sambo&#x27;s name until 2020. In late May 2020, George Floyd protests against racism in the United States began in cities across the United States, including Santa Barbara. A petition drive asked the owner to change the name of Sambo&#x27;s. In June 2020, the name on the original Sambo&#x27;s sign was temporarily changed to the motto &quot;☮ &amp; LOVE&quot; (&quot;Peace and love&quot;). In July 2020, the restaurant was officially renamed to &quot;Chad&#x27;s&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Sam Battistone, Jr. was the original owner of the New Orleans Jazz in the NBA. He later moved the team to Utah and sold it.

An abandoned Sambo&#x27;s was cleaned up and used for a scene in the movie &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;.

<text>The Vietnamese pheasant, or Vietnam fireback, was formerly considered a species of gallopheasant, &quot;Lophura hatinhensis&quot;, but is now considered a variant of Edward&#x27;s pheasant. Discovered in 1964, it is endemic to central Vietnam. Its range concentrates around Kẻ Gỗ Nature Reserve in Hà Tĩnh Province.

==Habitat==
The fireback inhabits primary and secondary (including logged) evergreen forest in lowlands and hills from sea level (at least historically) to about 300 m. It may tolerate habitat degradation, but is apparently far more common in closed-canopy forest, and has been trapped in dense, streamside vegetation.

<text>Juan Evangelista Venegas (December 27, 1928 – April 16, 1987) was a Puerto Rican boxer notable for winning Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Olympic medal.

==Early years==
Venegas (birth name: Juan Evangelista Venegas Trinidad) was born in an underprivileged section of the town of Río Piedras. Río Piedras at the time was not incorporated into the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico. There street fighting was a common way of life and many of the youth at that time saw the sport of boxing as a way to a better life. Among them was Venegas, who admired Puerto Rico&#x27;s first international boxing champion, Sixto Escobar. Venegas took up boxing and his performance in the ring soon caught the attention of the island&#x27;s recently established Olympic Committee. In 1948 the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee included him in the delegation which would represent the island.

==1948 Summer Olympics==
The 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in an international sporting event. The island&#x27;s delegation consisted of twelve members. In their opening ceremonies, the Puerto Rican delegation carried the flag of the United States into the Olympic stadium. The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of Commonwealth on July 25, 1952, would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.

In the 1948 Summer Olympics, known as the XIV Olympics, Juan Evangelista Venegas made Puerto Rican sports history by winning Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Olympic medal ever when he beat Belgium&#x27;s representative, Louis Callenboat, on points for a unanimous decision. He won the bronze medal in boxing in the Bantamweight division, falling short of the silver medal to Giovanni Zuddas.

==1948 Olympic results==
Below are the results of Juan Evangelista Venegas who competed as a bantamweight boxer for Puerto Rico at the 1948 London Olympics:

* Round of 32: defeated Louis Calebout (Belgium) on points
* Round of 16: defeated Babu Lall (India) on points
* Quarterfinal: defeated Albert Perera (Ceylon) on points
* Semifinal: lost to Tibor Csík (Hungary) on points
* Bronze-Medal bout: defeated Álvaro Vicente (Spain) on points (won bronze medal)

==Professional boxing career==
After returning to a hero&#x27;s welcome to Puerto Rico, Venegas turned professional. In 1948, Venegas made his professional boxing debut against Puerto Rican Abelardo Alejandro. Venegas, a southpaw, fought in the bantamweight and featherweight division for a total of 32 fights, compiling a record of 20-10-2. His last fight was in 1958 against Al Tisi.

==Death and legacy==

On April 16, 1987, Juan Evangelista Venegas died when he suffered a fall at his home which caused a skull fracture. A week before his death, he was honored by the College of Engineers and Surveyors of Puerto Rico.

In honor of his memory, the Puerto Rican Boxing Commission sponsors the Juan Evangelista Venegas boxing tournament, which serves as a tune-up to future Olympic boxing prospects. There is a Juan Evangelista Venegas Olympic Cup which is given in other sports with Olympic orientation.

<text>Picross is a puzzle video game franchise by Nintendo, in which the player solves nonogram puzzles. The series started in 1995 when Jupiter Corporation developed &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; for the Game Boy. After many entries published by Nintendo for multiple platforms, Jupiter started self-publishing &quot;Picross&quot; games such as the &quot;Picross e&quot; and &quot;Picross S&quot; series on Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch.

HAL Laboratory developed the &quot;Picross 3D&quot; spinoff series, with games on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS.

== Development ==

Due to the popularity of pen-and-paper nonogram puzzles at the time in Japan, Makoto Nakayama, founder of Jupiter Corporation, pitched a video game version of nonograms to Nintendo. Since Jupiter had little experience in game development, Ape Inc. (known now as Creatures Inc.) assisted with the game&#x27;s development. Shigeru Miyamoto oversaw the process from Nintendo&#x27;s side and proposed adding Mario to the game. &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; was released for the Game Boy in 1995. While it did not take off in the West, it sold well in Japan and led to several Japan-only entries, including &quot;Picross 2&quot; for the Game Boy, &quot;Mario&#x27;s Super Picross&quot; for the Super Famicom, the &quot;Picross NP&quot; series for the Nintendo Power service, and &quot;Tamori no Picross&quot; for Satellaview.

&quot;Picross DS&quot; was the first &quot;Picross&quot; title in 12 years to be released internationally, launching on the Nintendo DS in 2007. Shortly thereafter, HAL Laboratory, known for the Kirby series, developed &quot;Picross 3D&quot; for the Nintendo DS. The game used similar mechanics to traditional &quot;Picross&quot; but adapted them to a three-dimensional environment. The sequel, &quot;Picross 3D: Round 2&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015.

After unsuccessfully pitching a &quot;Picross DS&quot; sequel to Nintendo for the 3DS, Jupiter opted to self-publish &quot;Picross&quot; games under a licensing deal. They released nine titles and many spin-offs in the &quot;Picross e&quot; series for the Nintendo 3DS. Jupiter continues to self-publish &quot;Picross&quot; games on the Nintendo Switch, releasing nine titles and various spin-offs in the &quot;Picross S&quot; series.

<text>Eugène Rychlak Jr. (1968 – 26 July 2019) was a powerlifter from the United States, who specialized in the bench press. He was the first man to perform a bench press of over both and . He was also the founder of the Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate (RPS) powerlifting federation.

==Career==
Rychlak&#x27;s bodyweight was in excess of 345 lb (156 kg). Rychlak previously held the record for the world&#x27;s heaviest equipped bench press of 1010 lb (457 kg) December 16, 2006 in Lake George, NY. This record is now held by Ryan Kennelly, who has lifted 1075 lbs in the same lift.

At the 2005 Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, Rychlak attempted to break his own record by pressing 1015 lb (460 kg). Rychlak was unable to complete the press, and despite having several spotters around him, the weight fell onto his body. Rychlak suffered no serious injuries from the accident.

Rychlak has also squatted in competition.

<doc id="1229635" wikidata="Q1514925" url="?curid=1229635" title="Gerry Studds">
<text>Gerry Eastman Studds ( ; May 12, 1937 – October 14, 2006) was an American Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts who served from 1973 until 1997. He was the first member of Congress to be openly gay. In 1983 he was censured by the House of Representatives after he admitted to what he described as a &quot;consensual relationship&quot; with a 17-year-old page.

==Early life and career==
Gerry Studds was born in Mineola, New York to Elbridge Gerry Eastman Studds (an architect who helped design the FDR Drive in New York City) and the former Beatrice Murphy. He had a brother, Colin Studds, and a sister, Gaynor (Studds) Stewart. Through his father, he was a descendant of Elbridge Gerry, who served as the vice president of the United States and the governor of Massachusetts in the 1810s.

Studds obtained a full scholarship to Yale University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1959 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1961. While at Yale, he was a member of St. Anthony Hall. After graduating, he served in the United States Foreign Service and the Kennedy White House, where he helped develop the Peace Corps.

From 1965 to 1969, Studds taught history and politics at St. Paul&#x27;s School, a prep school in New Hampshire. He attracted a following of progressive students; the official school history described him as &quot;a lightning rod for student discontent[].&quot; Guided by Studds, 182 upperclassmen wrote a letter to the school&#x27;s conservative administration demanding reforms. St. Paul&#x27;s implemented many of the students&#x27; demands: it de-emphasized athletics, ended mandatory attendance at Sunday chapel, and eventually began admitting female students. However, in 1969, the school encouraged Studds to leave under unclear circumstances (see &quot;After Congress&quot;), sweetening the deal by paying for him to attend the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

While teaching at St. Paul&#x27;s, Studds achieved his first major political success, of a sort. In 1968, during the Vietnam War, Studds persuaded anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy to challenge incumbent president Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire presidential primary. He also ran McCarthy&#x27;s New Hampshire campaign operation, even though St. Paul&#x27;s refused McCarthy&#x27;s request to grant Studds a leave of absence so he could focus on defeating Johnson. McCarthy narrowly lost the New Hampshire primary to Johnson. Sensing weakness, Robert F. Kennedy entered the presidential race four days later, causing Johnson to retire from electoral politics.

==Career in the United States Congress==

=== Electoral history ===
Studds made his first run for Congress in 1970, seeking election in Massachusetts&#x27; 12th congressional district. He narrowly lost to the Republican incumbent Hastings Keith. Redistricting forced Keith to retire before the 1972 election, and Studds edged out the Republican William D. Weeks by just 1,118 votes. Studds was dogged by rumors of homosexuality in the 1978 campaign, but nonetheless won re-election. In 1983, Studds was transferred to the 10th congressional district after another round of redistricting, serving until 1997.

=== 1983 congressional page scandal ===
Studds was a central figure in the 1983 congressional page sex scandal, when he and Representative Dan Crane were each separately censured by the House of Representatives for inappropriate relationships with congressional pages—in Studds&#x27; case, a 1973 sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male. In addition, two other male pages testified, and Studds confirmed, that Studds had made sexual advances to them in 1973.

During the course of the House Ethics Committee&#x27;s investigation, Studds publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, thereby becoming the first openly gay Member of Congress. In an address to the House, Studds said, &quot;It is not a simple task for any of us to meet adequately the obligations of either public or private life, let alone both, but these challenges are made substantially more complex when one is, as I am, both an elected public official and gay.&quot; Although Studds disagreed with the committee&#x27;s findings of improper sexual conduct, he waived his right to a public hearing in order to protect the privacy of those involved. He said that deciding not to have a hearing &quot;presented me with the most difficult choice I have had to make in my life.&quot;

Studds defended his sexual involvement as a &quot;mutually voluntary, private relationship between adults.&quot; At the time, he acknowledged that it had been inappropriate to engage in a relationship with a subordinate and that he had committed &quot;a very serious error in judgment.&quot; He would later say that &quot;It was a damn stupid and inappropriate thing to do, and I never said it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; However, after Studds&#x27; death, his widower Dean Hara said that Studds had never been ashamed of the relationship. In testimony to investigators, the page testified that being Studds&#x27; sexual partner made him &quot;somewhat uncomfortable&quot; and that &quot;I would [rather] have had the friendship that I had with the man without the sex,&quot; but qualified his testimony by saying that his experience with Studds was not &quot;destructive or painful.&quot; The page also said that Studds neither offered him an inducement to sleep with him nor prevented him from ending the relationship.

The House Ethics Committee initially recommended the less punitive option of a reprimand, which would not have cost Studds his subcommittee chairmanship on the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. However, the full House raised the penalty under discussion from reprimand to censure, by a vote of 338–87. On July 20, 1983, the House voted to censure Studds, by a vote of 420–3. The three &quot;no&quot; votes were Bill Clay, Mervyn Dymally, and Parren Mitchell.

In 2006, following the Mark Foley page scandal, pundits compared the actions of Foley and Congress in 2006 to Studds and Congress in 1983.

=== Congressional career and political views ===
Although Studds lost his subcommittee chairmanship as a result of the page scandal, the setback was only temporary.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Studds&#x27; sexuality &quot;apparently was not news to many of his constituents.&quot; (His congressional district included the gay colonies of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Provincetown.) Studds received two standing ovations from supporters in his home district at his first town meeting following his censure. He was re-elected to the House six more times after the 1983 censure and became chairman of the full Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in 1992.

As a Member of Congress, Studds advocated for environmental and maritime issues, AIDS funding, and civil rights, particularly for gays and lesbians. He supported protectionist policies for the Massachusetts fishing industry, and in the 1970s he &quot;largely&quot; drafted a ban on foreign vessels fishing within 200 miles of the U.S. coast, winning him the lifelong friendship of Alaska Republican Don Young, the bill&#x27;s co-author, who reportedly &quot;hate[d] homosexuals and eastern liberals, but not Mr. Studds.&quot; In 1992 he authored the National Marine Sanctuaries Reauthorization and Improvement Act. In 1994 he joined with Ted Kennedy to introduce legislation to end discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace.

Throughout his life, Studds maintained the anti-war views that had spurred his initial entry into electoral politics. He was an outspoken opponent of the Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense system. He also criticized the United States government&#x27;s secretive support for the Contra fighters in Nicaragua.

==After Congress==

=== Later years and death ===
After retiring from Congress in 1997, Studds worked as a lobbyist for the fishing industry. He also served as the executive director of the New Bedford Aquarium.

Studds and partner Dean T. Hara (his companion since 1991) were married in Boston on May 24, 2004, one week after Massachusetts became the first state in the country to legalize same-sex marriage.

On October 14, 2006, Studds died at age 69 following a pulmonary embolism. Due to the federal ban on same-sex marriage, Hara was not eligible, upon Studds&#x27; death, to receive the pension provided to surviving spouses of former members of Congress. Hara later joined a federal lawsuit, &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;, that successfully challenged the constitutionality of section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act.

=== Accolades ===
When Studds retired from Congress, Don Young sponsored a bill to name the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary after Studds. The sanctuary sits at the mouth of Massachusetts Bay.

In August 2019, Studds was added to the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood honoring LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

=== 2018 sexual misconduct allegations ===
In 2018, St. Paul&#x27;s School published an investigative report concerning allegations of faculty-student sexual misconduct over the years. The investigators quoted two former SPS students who claimed that they had questionable encounters with Studds during their time at the school, and described their statements as &quot;substantiated.&quot; One of the witnesses also relayed that according to another SPS teacher, the school fired Studds in 1969 for inappropriate conduct with students; the report did not confirm or deny this claim. (Before the report&#x27;s publication, it was commonly believed that the school had encouraged Studds to leave due to his &quot;anti-establishment views.&quot;) Another alumnus sued SPS in 2018, alleging an additional, more serious, case of sexual misconduct. A posthumous biography of Studds, published the year before SPS released the report, noted that before Studds&#x27; death, he had admitted that as a teacher, he had sometimes dealt with students &quot;in ways that were human but neither professional nor responsible.&quot;

<text>Eugene Benton Sperling (born December 24, 1958) is an American lawyer who was director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. He is the only person to serve as national economic advisor under two presidents. Outside of government, he founded the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution in 2002.

In February 2021, as the nomination of Neera Tanden for OMB director faced opposition, Sperling was considered to be one of the leading contenders to assume the top position. Sperling served as Senior Advisor to President Biden and Implementation Coordinator of the American Rescue Plan. On August 5, 2024, the White House announced that Sperling was leaving the administration to work with the Vice President&#x27;s election campaign.

== Early life and education ==
Sperling was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Doris Louise (née Hyman) and Lawrence Sperling. He is of Jewish descent. He attended Pioneer High School and then Community High School from which he graduated. In 1982, he graduated with a B.A. in political science from the University of Minnesota where he was captain of the Men&#x27;s Varsity Tennis Team. In 1985 he graduated with a juris doctor from Yale Law School where he served as a senior editor of the Yale Law Journal. While at Yale Law School, he worked for future Labor Secretary Robert Reich. He also attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and worked as an economic adviser on Michael Dukakis&#x27; campaign.

Prior to joining the National Economic Council, Sperling served as deputy director of economic policy for the presidential transition and economic policy director of the Clinton-Gore presidential campaign. From 1990 to 1992, he was an economic advisor to Governor Mario Cuomo of New York.

== Career ==

=== Clinton administration ===
Sperling served as deputy director (from 1993 to 1996) and then director (from 1996 to 2001) of the National Economic Council during the Clinton administration. As deputy director from 1993 to 1996, Sperling helped design and pass several of President Clinton&#x27;s early initiatives, including 1993 Deficit Reduction Act, the major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Direct Student Loan Act.

As director from 1996 to 2001, Sperling was a principal negotiator of the 1997 bipartisan Balanced Budget Act, which included the creation of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program. He reportedly held up the final negotiation to ensure that the design of the child tax credit would lead to bigger payments for lower-income families on the Earned Income Tax Credit. He also played a leading role in the design and passage of other Clinton administration economic initiatives, including the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit, the New Markets Tax Credit, the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, the Gear-UP Early College Mentoring program, expanded debt relief to poor nations, and stronger international protections against abusive child labor. He was the architect of the Save Social Security First budget strategy, and co-negotiated the final week of the China WTO agreement in Beijing in 1999 with United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. Sperling worked with then-Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to negotiate protections for the Community Reinvestment Act in the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act. These protections helped secure passage of the bill. Sperling represented the U.S. government and gave a keynote address at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal in 2000, where the world committed to the second millennium development goal of universal primary education.

=== Post-Clinton administration ===
After leaving the Clinton Administration, Sperling focused on promoting universal education, particularly for girls in poor and developing nations. In 2002, he founded the Center for Universal Education at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution and served as its first executive director for seven years from 2002 to 2008. In that role, Sperling advocated for a global compact for education for all children, with publications on universal education for all nations in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;The New York Times, Washington Post, Financial Times, Los Angeles Times, and IMF Quarterly: Finance and Development.&quot; He also authored concept papers for the Education for All Fast Track Initiative on &quot;Closing the Trust Gaps: Unlocking Financing for Education in Fragile State&quot; and &quot;How to Unlock Financing for Fragile States and Move Toward a More Unified Global Architecture for Education Financing: Eight Preliminary Recommendations&quot;. Sperling was a member of U.N. Millennium Task Force on Girls&#x27; Education.

In 2003, Sperling also founded the Global Campaign for Education-US, a broad-based coalition of national and community-based organizations, international NGOs, teacher unions, faith-based groups, and think tanks dedicated to ensuring universal quality education for all children. The organization&#x27;s mission is &quot;to promote education as a basic human right and mobilize to create political will in the United States and internationally to ensure universal quality education.&quot;

In 2004, he co-authored the book &quot;What Works in Girls&#x27; Education: Evidence and Policies from the Developing World&quot; with Barbara Herz. In addition, Sperling was also a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and authored &quot;The Pro-Growth Progressive: An Economic Strategy for Shared Prosperity&quot; in that role. For four years, he was a consultant and had partial writing credit for four episodes for the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Sperling is the author of the 2020 book &quot;Economic Dignity,&quot; building on a 2019 piece he published in Democracy Journal.

Sperling was a top economic adviser for Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.

Prior to joining the Obama administration, Sperling earned $887,727 from Goldman Sachs in 2008 for his work helping to create and implement their 10,000 Women charitable initiative, which funds business education for women in developing nations. He was also compensated $158,000 for speeches, mostly to financial companies. Sperling received $2.2 million in total compensation in 2008 from a variety of consulting jobs, board seats, speaking fees and fellowships.

=== Obama administration ===

From 2009 to 2011, Sperling served as a counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. He advised on responding to the financial crisis, was a member of the Obama Auto Rescue Task Force, was Geithner&#x27;s top aide on fiscal, budget, tax, and small business issues, and coordinated the Treasury efforts on design and passage of the Affordable Care Act. Sperling was a leading advocate in the administration for increasing refundable tax credits for working families, extending unemployment benefits, adding restrictions on executive compensation for companies receiving public funds, and proposing a fee on major financial institutions. Sperling was reported to have been one of the key members of the administration to advocate to President Obama that he save Chrysler. Sperling is credited with designing the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which created a $30 billion fund for loans and the State Small Business Credit Initiative.

In January 2011, President Barack Obama appointed Sperling as the director of the National Economic Council, Sperling&#x27;s second tenure in that position. 
In that role, Sperling played a key role representing the White House in budget negotiations with Congress as well as serving as the White House point person on several of the president&#x27;s top priorities including job creation, manufacturing policy, housing, GSE reform, and skills initiatives. He was credited with being the key architect of the $447 billion American Jobs Act and he led the Obama Administration&#x27;s Detroit rescue task force in 2013, which mobilized $300 million to support Detroit. Sperling also led the design and implementation of the president&#x27;s initiatives on supporting workers facing long-term unemployment, Manufacturing Innovation Hubs, SelectUSA, the College Opportunity Summit, and the ConnectED initiative. According to Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, &quot;If you look at key budget legislation – in 1993, 1997, 2009, 2010 or 2012 – there is no administration official who did more over the past 20 years to dramatically expand tax credits for low-income workers, with the result that these credits now lift 10 million people out of poverty.&quot;

Sperling was named one of the 100 Most Powerful People in Finance worldwide in 2013 by Worth Magazine. He was named one of the 50 Most Powerful People in Washington by GQ in 2012.

Sperling left the National Economic Council in March 2014.

Two years after Sperling left the White House, a &quot;ProPublica&quot; article reported that he had taken loans totaling between $300,000 and $600,000 from Howard Shapiro, a lawyer at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, between 2011 and 2013. Shapiro has been Sperling&#x27;s closest friend since they were housemates at Yale Law School in 1983. Sperling stated that when his savings were depleted, he &quot;took personal loans from my very closest friend of more than 30 years so that I could afford to remain in public service without having to sell our house when we had only two more years left with both of our children at home.&quot; His house in Washington, D.C. was valued at &quot;around $2 million.&quot;

A White House spokesperson said that every loan had been &quot;reviewed and cleared by White House Counsel and the Office of Government Ethics&quot; and that &quot;no issue came before Sperling that prompted him to recuse himself.&quot; Kenneth Gross, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom who specializes in federal gift and gratuity rules, stated that the fact that the loans were disclosed and cleared by the ethics office &quot;takes the guy off the hook. What more is he supposed to do?&quot;

The &quot;ProPublica&quot; article stated that Sperling &quot;played a role&quot; in a federal and state government settlement with five major financial institutions over foreclosure and mortgage servicing abuses, and that WilmerHale was &quot;one of many law firms involved in negotiating the settlement,&quot; though it did not state that Shapiro was involved in the settlement. Sperling told ProPublica he was not involved in the negotiations and only &quot;helped decide that settlement money would go toward reducing principal on mortgages for borrowers whose homes were worth less than their mortgages.&quot; The &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Sperling met with groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to persuade them of the benefits the deal would have for borrowers.

=== Biden administration ===
On March 15, 2021, President Joe Biden announced that Sperling was selected to oversee the roll-out of the newly signed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. He resigned in August 2024 in order to assume a position as a senior economic advisor on the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign.

==Personal life==
Sperling is married to television writer Allison Abner, whom he met when he was a consultant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The West Wing&quot;. They have a daughter, Nina, and a son, Miles.

<text>Partmaximum () was a limit on the salary of a member of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, a maximum wage. Partmaximum was introduced in 1920 by a decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (ВЦИК) for all communists that held executive positions in Party, industry, government and Soviet trade unions. Their salary was not supposed to exceed that of a highly qualified industrial worker. If a communist had other incomes, e.g., honoraria or royalties, he had to transfer a specified percentage from the amount above the partmaximum into the Party funds.

Partmaximum was cancelled by a secret resolution of the Politburo of February 8, 1932; however, it was bypassed with benefits in kind even earlier. This cancellation is thought to mark the onset of the formation of the privileged nomenklatura class of Soviet apparatchiks, whose well-being no longer depended on the well-being of subordinated workers.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (; 7 October 1798 – 19 March 1875) was a French luthier, businessman, inventor and winner of many awards. His workshop made over 3,000 instruments.

==Early life==

Vuillaume was born in Mirecourt, where his father and grandfather were luthiers.

==Career==
Vuillaume moved to Paris in 1818 to work for François Chanot. In 1821, he joined the workshop of Simon Lété, François-Louis Pique&#x27;s son-in-law, at Rue Pavée St. Sauveur. He became his partner and in 1825 settled in the Rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs under the name of &quot;Lété et Vuillaume&quot;. His first labels are dated 1823.

In 1827, at the height of the Neo-Gothic period, he started to make imitations of old instruments, some copies were undetectable.

In 1827, he won a silver medal at the Paris Universal Exhibition, and in 1828, he started his own business at 46 Rue Croix des Petits-Champs.

His workshop became the most important in Paris and within twenty years, it led Europe. A major factor in his success was his 1855 purchase of 144 instruments made by the Italian masters for 80,000 francs, from the heirs of Luigi Tarisio, an Italian tradesman. These included the &quot;Messiah Stradivarius&quot; and 24 other Stradivari.

In 1858, in order to avoid Paris customs duty on wood imports, he moved to Rue Pierre Demours near the Ternes, outside Paris. He was at the height of success, having won various gold medals in the competitions of the Paris Universal Exhibitions in 1839, 1844 and 1855; the Council Medal in London in 1851 and, in that same year, the Legion of Honour.

A maker of more than 3,000 instruments—almost all of which are numbered—and a fine tradesman, Vuillaume was also a gifted inventor, as his research in collaboration with the acoustics expert Félix Savart demonstrates. As an innovator, he developed many new instruments and mechanisms, most notably a large viola which he called a &quot;contralto&quot;, and the three-string Octobass (1849–51), a huge triple bass standing 3.48 metres high.

He also created the hollow steel bow (particularly appreciated by Charles de Bériot, among others), and the &#x27;self-rehairing&#x27; bow. For the latter, the hair purchased in prepared hanks could be inserted by the player in the time it takes to change a string, and was tightened or loosened by a simple mechanism inside the frog. The frog itself was fixed to the stick, and the balance of the bow thus remained constant when the hair stretched with use.

He also designed a round-edged frog mounted to the butt by means of a recessed track, which he encouraged his bowmakers to use; other details of craft, however, make it possible to identify the actual maker of many Vuillaume bows. The bows are stamped, often rather faintly, either &quot;vuillaume à paris&quot; or &quot;j.b. vuillaume&quot;.

Other innovations include the insertion of Stanhopes in the eye of the frogs of his bows, a kind of mute (the &quot;&quot;) and several machines, including one for manufacturing gut strings of perfectly equal thickness.

Many of the great bow makers of the 19th century collaborated with his workshop. Jean Pierre Marie Persois, Jean Adam, Dominique Peccatte, Nicolas Rémy Maire, François Peccatte, Nicolas Maline, Joseph Henry, Pierre Simon, François Nicolas Voirin, Charles Peccatte, Charles Claude Husson, Joseph Fonclause, Jean Joseph Martin, and Prosper Colas are among the most celebrated.

Vuillaume was an innovative violin maker and restorer, and a tradesman who traveled all of Europe in search of instruments. Due to this fact, most instruments by the great Italian violin makers passed through his workshop. Vuillaume then made accurate measurements of their dimensions and made copies of them.

He drew his inspiration from two violin makers and their instruments: Antonio Stradivari and his &quot;Le Messie&quot; (Messiah), and Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù and his &quot;Il Cannone&quot; which belonged to Niccolò Paganini; others such as Maggini, Da Salò and Nicola Amati were also imitated, but to a lesser extent.

Vuillaume made numerous copies of his favorite violin &quot;Le Messie&quot;, the more noteworthy among them being:

Vuillaume was able to craft such a perfect replica of &quot;Il Cannone&quot;, that upon viewing them side by side, Paganini was unable to tell which was the original. He was able to recognize the master instrument only upon hearing subtle differences in tone during playing.

The copy violin was eventually passed on to Paganini&#x27;s only student, Camillo Sivori. Sivori owned great violins by Nicolò Amati, Stradivari, and Bergonzi, but the Vuillaume was his favourite. This violin is owned by the Musei Di Genova and displayed in their Palazzo Tursi.

When making these copies, Vuillaume always remained faithful to the essential qualities of the instruments he imitated – their thickness, the choice of the woods, and the shape of the arching. The only differences, always the result of a personal decision, were the colour of the varnish, the height of the ribs or the length of the instruments.

His most beautiful violins were often named after the people who owned them (Caraman de Chimay, Cheremetoff, Doria)

Vuillaume occasionally named his instruments: twelve were named after birds, for example the &quot;Golden Pheasant&quot;, &quot;The Thrush&quot; and twelve were named after the apostles such as &quot;St. Joseph&quot; and &quot;Saint Paul&quot;. A few others were also named after important biblical characters &quot;The Evangelists&quot; and Millant, in his book on Vuillaume, mentions a &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;.

A rare violin by Vuillaume (c. 1874, Paris) showcases inlaid ebony fleur-de-lys designs and is one of the last instruments to come out of Vuillaume&#x27;s workshop, made a year before his death. Crafted for the famous violin dealer David Laurie, &quot;Label reads: Jean Baptiste Vuillaume a Paris, 3 Rue Demour-Ternes, expres pour mon ami David Laurie, 1874&quot;, numbered 2976 and signed on the label. It&#x27;s a copy of a Nicolò Amati violin originally belonging to Prince Youssoupoff (a Russian aristocrat and pupil of Henri Vieuxtemps). Only six copies were made.

He also had practice violins, known as &quot;St. Cécile violins&quot;, made by his brother Nicolas de Mirecourt. Another lesser line, also made by Nicolas, was labelled &quot;Stentor&quot;.

His main contribution to violin-making was his work on varnish. The purfling&#x27;s joints are often cut on the straight and not on the bias as was traditional, in the middle in the pin. His brand is burnt at a length of 1 cm. There is generally a black dot on the joint of the top under the bridge. He used an external mould. The stop is generally 193 mm long. In this respect he follows to the French 18th-century tradition of a short stop (190 mm), which was traditionally 195 mm long in Italy and even 200 mm long in Germany. The violin&#x27;s serial number is inscribed in the middle inside the instrument. Its date (only the last two figures) in the upper paraph on the back. His violins of the first period have large edges and his brand was then burnt inside the middle bouts. The varnish varied from orange-red to red. After 1860, his varnish became lighter.

In addition to the above-mentioned bow makers, most 19th-century Parisian violin makers worked in his workshop, including Hippolyte Silvestre, Jean-Joseph Honoré Derazey, Charles Buthod, Charles-Adolphe Maucotel, Télesphore Barbé, Paul Bailly and George Gemünder.

Nestor Audinot, a pupil of Sébastien Vuillaume, himself Jean-Baptiste&#x27;s nephew, succeeded him in his workshop in 1875. Vuillaume died at the height of his career, widely regarded as the pre-eminent luthier of his day.

<text>Lee Scott Wolosky (born July 17, 1968) is an American diplomat and attorney who served under four U.S. presidents in legal and national security positions, most recently as Special Counsel to President Joe Biden. He is currently co-chair of the Litigation Department and a member of the Management Committee at Jenner &amp; Block LLP

== Early life ==

Wolosky grew up in The Bronx and attended Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School in Manhattan. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College, where he was a recipient of the John Harvard Scholarship and the Harvard College Scholarship. Before attending law school, Wolosky worked as a research assistant for a Harvard University project focused on Soviet political and economic reform. He graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;Harvard International Law Journal&quot; and a recipient of the Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellowship. While in law school, he served as an intern to Sonia Sotomayor, then a federal district court judge.

== Government ==

Wolosky served as Director for Transnational Threats on the United States National Security Council in the White House Office, under President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The Transnational Threats Directorate was responsible for coordinating the U.S. Government&#x27;s response to terrorism prior to the September 11 attacks. At the White House, Wolosky had specific responsibility for coordinating U.S. policy relating to illicit finance impacting national security.

Wolosky&#x27;s work at the White House also included directing sensitive operations, including leading the U.S. government effort to apprehend the Taliban and al Qaeda-linked arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Wolosky was noted for his innovative approach for pursuing Bout. Wolosky&#x27;s pursuit of Bout served as a loose basis for the character Jack Valentine (played by Ethan Hawke) in the film &quot;Lord of War&quot;.

Wolosky has served as a consultant to various agencies of the U.S. Government in recent years and has testified on several occasions before the United States Congress. He also testified before the 9/11 Commission in both open and closed sessions.

During 2003 and 2004, Wolosky served as a senior advisor to the presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry and as co-director of the campaign&#x27;s counter-terrorism policy coordinating group.

Wolosky is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He served as co-director of the Council on Foreign Relation&#x27;s Independent Task Force on Terrorist Financing and deputy director of the Council on Foreign Relations&#x27;s Independent Task Force on Russia. He was also a co-founder and member of the board of directors of the National Security Network. He was appointed to the American Bar Association&#x27;s Standing Committee on Law and National Security in 2010.

Wolosky has also served as an adjunct professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University

=== Guantanamo ===
As Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure from July 2015 to January 2017, Wolosky served as chief U.S. diplomat in connection with Barack Obama&#x27;s efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Among other responsibilities, he led the Obama Administration&#x27;s final diplomatic efforts to reduce the detainee population before the end of Obama&#x27;s term, by transferring detainees who had been unanimously approved for transfer by the United States Secretary of Defense, State, Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Director of National Intelligence.

During his 18-month tenure as Special Envoy, Wolosky completed the transfer of 75 detainees to 15 countries, or almost 40% of all such transfers during President Obama&#x27;s eight-year term in office.

Since closure of the Office by the first Trump administration, the U.S. government has lost track of several of the Guantanamo detainees Wolosky arranged to release.

== Legal career ==
In 2001, Wolosky joined Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner LLP, the prominent U.S. law firm led by David Boies whose partners are known for high-profile matters such as the representation of Al Gore in the contested 2000 U.S. presidential election, representation of the U.S. Government in its anti-trust dispute with Microsoft, and representation of American International Group and its former CEO, Maurice R. Greenberg. During his time at Boies Schiller, Wolosky led or co-led some of the firm&#x27;s high-profile matters, including the firm&#x27;s representation of Greenberg, its representation of former RNC Vice Chair Elliott Broidy in litigation against Qatar, its terrorism financing case against Bank of China; and &quot;Restis v United Against Nuclear Iran&quot;, a precedent-setting private defamation case in which the United States Government asserted the state secrets privilege, resulting in a victory for Wolosky&#x27;s client UANI. Wolosky also served as co-lead counsel to certain of the 9/11 families in connection with a multibillion-dollar federal court judgment entered against Iran; and as lead counsel to a major international corporation in matters arising out of an alleged assault by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

In October 2019, Wolosky was appointed Independent Monitor of Deutsche Bank by the New York State Department of Financial Services and urged the bank to exit Russia. Wolosky has also represented Fiona Hill, a former advisor on the United States National Security Council, in the 2019 impeachment hearings of Donald Trump and opposed the White House&#x27;s efforts to prevent her testimony. He has also represented MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace, and Emmy Award-winning journalist Lowell Bergman. Neil Cavuto, the conservative Fox News anchor, has called Wolosky &quot;one of the brightest lawyers in the country.&quot;

In 2020, Wolosky joined Jenner &amp; Block LLP. Previously, he worked at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and as an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. At Paul Weiss, he worked principally with and was mentored by Ted Sorensen, the seventh White House Counsel under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

In August 2021, Wolosky was named to the advisory board of American facial recognition company Clearview AI as of counsel.

<text>The FMA IA 58 Pucará () is an Argentine ground-attack and counter-insurgency (COIN) aircraft manufactured by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones. It is a low-wing twin-turboprop all-metal monoplane with retractable landing gear, capable of operating from unprepared strips when operationally required. The type saw action during the Falklands War and the Sri Lankan Civil War.

==Development==
In August 1966 the Argentine state aircraft factory, Dirección Nacional de Fabricación e Investigación Aeronáutica (DINFIA), began development of the AX-2, a Counter-insurgency (COIN) aircraft to meet a requirement of the Argentine Air Force. The project was promoted by engineer Ricardo Olmedo and became under the guidance of engineer Aníbal Dreidemie, who also designed the IA-52 Guaraní II and the IA-63 Pampa. The chosen layout was a low-wing monoplane powered by two turboprop engines mounted in wing-mounted nacelles and fitted with a T-tail. In order to test the proposed layout, DINFIA first built a full-scale unpowered glider test vehicle, which flew for the first time on 26 December 1967.

Testing of the glider showed no major handling problems, and in September 1968, construction began on a powered prototype, given the designation FMA IA 58 Delfín, but later renamed Pucará, to be powered by a pair of Garrett TPE331I/U-303 engines. (DINFIA had been renamed the (FMA) earlier that year). The first prototype made its maiden flight on 20 August 1969, with a second prototype, with power switching to Turbomeca Astazou XVIGs, following on 6 September 1970. The first prototype was later re-engined with the Astazou, this engine being chosen for the production version, and a third production prototype followed in 1973. The first production model flew on 8 November 1974, with deliveries beginning in early 1976.

At least three projects were related to the IA-58 development. The first was an extended Pucará airframe with pressurized cabin for six passengers, equipped with Astafan turbofan engines for light transport and photography duties. The second was an observation and reconnaissance aircraft having the same configuration as the Fairchild-Republic A-10. The third was denominated IA-60 and was an advanced trainer and light attack platform powered by two Astafans conserving the basic airframe and canopy of the Pucará with T-tail incorporating high wings. Some tests were made on wind tunnels but no further development was made in order to proceed with the IA-63 Pampa program.

==Design==
The IA 58 Pucará is of conventional, all-metal (mainly duralumin) construction. The unswept cantilever wings have 7 degrees of dihedral on the outer panels and are fitted with slotted trailing-edge flaps. The IA-58 has a slender fuselage, with a tandem cockpit arrangement; the crew of two is seated under the upward opening clamshell canopy on Martin-Baker Mk 6AP6A zero/zero ejection seats and are provided with dual controls and good visibility, at least in the lateral and front quarters. The clean aerodynamic design allows the Pucará to reach relatively high speed, higher than the American OV-10 Bronco, another COIN aircraft. On the other hand, the IA 58 has no cargo bay inside the fuselage as requested for the American aircraft.

Armour plating is fitted to protect the crew and engines from ground fire. The aircraft is powered by a pair of Turbomeca Astazou engines, driving sets of three-bladed Ratier-Forest 23LF propellers; the propellers are also capable of being used as air brakes.

The Pucará was designed for operations from short, rough airstrips. The retractable tricycle landing gear, with a single nosewheel and twin mainwheels retracting into the engine nacelles, is fitted with low pressure tyres to suit operations on rough ground, while the undercarriage legs are tall to give good clearance for underslung weapons loads. Three JATO rockets can be fitted under the fuselage to allow extra short takeoffs. Fuel is fed from two fuselage tanks of combined capacity of and two self-sealing tanks of in the wings. The undercarriage, flaps and brakes are operated hydraulically, with no pneumatic systems. The spring suspension system is like the one used in the Junkers Ju 88, while the tail has a T configuration to improve take-off.

Fixed armament of the Pucará is similar to that of many WWII era aircraft. It consists of two Hispano 804 20 mm cannons mounted under the cockpit with 270 rounds each and four 7.62 mm Browning FN machine guns mounted on the sides of the fuselage with 900 rounds each. Three hardpoints are fitted for carrying external stores single or in clusters (as example up to six bombs under the fuselage or two rockets under each wing) such as bombs, rockets or external fuel tanks, with one of capacity mounted under the fuselage and the remaining two, of capacity beneath the wings. Maximum external weapons load is . Onboard armaments are aimed by a simple reflector sight.

==Operational history==

The first units were delivered in May 1975 to the Argentine Air Force (, FAA), equipping the 2° , part of the 3rd Air Brigade () in Reconquista, northern Santa Fe province. They had their operational debut late in 1975, when a number of Pucarás carried out counter-insurgency strikes from Córdoba against Communist ERP guerillas in Tucumán Province as part of Operativo Independencia.

=== 1982 Falklands war ===
By the time of the Falklands War, about 60 Pucarás had been delivered. As one of the few aircraft of the Argentine service capable of flying operationally from the small airfields in the Falklands, as the runway at Port Stanley Airport was not long enough for FAA Skyhawks and Mirages to be deployed, it was decided to deploy a number of Pucarás to the Falklands, with four arriving at Port Stanley on 2 April 1982, and a further eight arriving on 9 April. Many of the Pucarás remaining on the mainland were moved to Puerto Santa Cruz or Comodoro Rivadavia in southern Argentina where they were closer to the Falklands if needed for reinforcements, and were used to perform coastal surveillance.

Most aircraft used in combat were armed with unguided bombs, 2.75 inch rocket pods, or 7.62 mm machine gun pods. Pucarás operated from Port Stanley airport and two small grass improvised airfields at Goose Green and Pebble Island. They were used in the reconnaissance and light-attack role.

Three Pucarás were destroyed and one of their pilots killed at Goose Green by cluster bombs dropped by 800 NAS Sea Harriers on 1 May 1982. Six more were destroyed in the SAS Raid on Pebble Island on 15 May 1982.

On 21 May a Pucará was lost to a Stinger SAM fired by D Squadron SAS (the first Stinger launched in combat) and another to 30 mm cannon rounds from Cmdr Nigel Ward&#x27;s RN Sea Harrier, the latter after leading a successful two-aircraft raid on a shed allegedly used as an observation post by British forces. The aircraft was surprisingly tough, as Ward observed no fewer than 20 cannon hits before the target started to fall to earth. The other Pucará, piloted by Lt Juan Micheloud, made good its escape after being chased by Lt Cdr Alasdair Craig&#x27;s Sea Harrier. Major Carlos Tomba, the pilot of the aircraft shot down by Cmdr Ward, survived the ejection and was recovered by friendly forces.

Two Pucarás shot down a Royal Marines Scout helicopter with 7.62 mm machine gun fire on 28 May, while it was on a casualty evacuation mission during the Battle of Goose Green. This was the only confirmed Argentine air-to-air victory of the war. One of these Pucarás crashed into Blue Mountain on the return flight to Port Stanley and was destroyed—the body of the pilot (Lt Miguel Gimenez) was found in 1986, and was buried with military honours at Port Darwin by his family, the first Argentine relatives to visit the Falklands since the end of the war.

Also on the 28 May 2 Para shot down a Pucará with small arms fire after it launched rockets on British troops (without causing any casualties), during the Battle of Goose Green. Lt Miguel Cruzado ejected and became a POW.

==== Captured aircraft ====
After the Argentine surrender, eleven Pucarás (four of them in flying condition) were captured by British forces, and six were taken back to the United Kingdom.

=== Sri Lankan Civil War ===
The Sri Lanka Air Force in search for an aircraft for counter-insurgency operations and facing refusal of military supplies from western countries who were its traditional military suppliers, purchased two Pucarás from the Argentine Air Force. They were attached to the No 1 Flying Training based at SLAF Anuradhapura and were issued SLAF serials CA-601 and CA-602. Following initial training, Pucarás were used for advanced pilot training with two pilots, and combat sorties with a single pilot. In 1993, two more aircraft, CA-604 and CA-605, were added. Pucarás were found to be highly effective for the Sri Lanka Air Force as they had high payload capacity and suitable cruising speed for close air support. Operating mainly out of SLAF Anuradhapura, at times Pucarás were detached to its forward base at SLAF Palaly, providing close air support for the Sri Lanka Army notably during Operation Riviresa. The Sri Lanka Air Force also deployed Pucarás for maritime patrolling. CA-605 was hit by ground fire over the Kilaly lagoon, but managed to land at SLAF Palaly; it is on display at the Sri Lanka Air Force Museum. During fierce fighting in the Northern Province during Operation Leap Forward, CA-601 was shot down by a MPADS in July 1995, killing its pilot Flight Lieutenant Dilhan Perera. CA-604 was destroyed while on a night bombing sortie from what appears to have been a premature ordnance detonation; its pilot Flight Lieutenant R. A. U. P. Rajapaksa ejected safely. Following the accident the sole remaining aircraft, CA-602, was retired in 1997 with Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships taking over the role of close air support, followed by Mikoyan MiG-27s. The Pucará&#x27;s lack of an oxygen system, limiting it to low altitudes, and lack of counter-measures against SAMs proved it be its main limitations.

=== Upgrades ===
In May 1982, at the peak of the Falklands War, the Argentine Air Force, in collaboration with the Navy, outfitted a prototype, AX-04, with pylons to mount Mark 13 torpedoes. The aim was its possible production as a torpedo bomber to enhance the anti-ship capabilities of the Argentine air forces. Several trials were performed off Puerto Madryn, over Golfo Nuevo, but the war ended before the technicians could evaluate the feasibility of the project.

Several attempts were made to upgrade the entire fleet, including the Pucará Charlie conversion, Pucará 2000 and Pucará Bravo (modernization of 40 units was ordered and later cancelled by the FAA; only one unit was converted). These were cancelled during the 1980s due to shortage of funds.

The Uruguayan Air Force updated its fleet with the incorporation of Litton LTN-211 and GPS omega navigation systems. Minor structure modifications were made in order to carry the Mk. 82 Snakeye bomb and 1000-litre drop tank. Other avionics incorporated were the WX-500 Stormscope by L3 Communications and LED Sandel SN3500 backlit display navigation.

In 2007 an IA-58 of the Argentine Air Force was converted to carry a modified engine operating on soy-derived bio-jet fuel. The project, financed and directed by the Argentine Government (), made Argentina the second nation in the world to propel an aircraft with biojet fuel. The project&#x27;s intention was to make the FAA less reliant on fossil fuels.

Since 2009 an extensive upgrade of the avionics and major overhaul of the airframes has been carried out by the FAA and FAdeA, creating the IA-58D Pucará Delta. The avionics for the cockpit are as close as possible to the FMA IA-63 Pampa Phase II. Some of the updated components include a new set of communications hardware, DME, ELT, IFF, GPS, EADI, EHSI, RWR, HUD, DEFA 554 cannon and new PT6A-62 950shp engine instead of the original Turbomeca Astazou. The overhaul is intended to keep Argentinian Pucarás in use until 2045. Bureaucratic and economic issues caused delays to the conversion of the entire fleet. The Uruguayan Air Force also showed interest in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program and installation of new engines offered by FAdeA.

As of April 2016, Fábrica Argentina de Aviones &quot;Brigadier San Martin&quot; S.A. (FAdeA), successor to Fábrica Militar de Aviones, was in the process of modernizing twenty of the Argentine Air Force&#x27;s fleet of Pucaras. The first prototype flew in November 2015.

In 2019 Argentina retired the Pucará from counterinsurgency light strike operation, converting it to the &quot;Pucará Fénix&quot; border surveillance and patrol aircraft, with improved Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT-6A-62 engines, new four-bladed propellers, a podded Fixview electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turret, and datalink. The upgrade was authorised in December 2021, with the Fénix expected to be in operation for at least 15 years.

===Failed contracts===
The Peruvian Air Force was reported in mid 1972 to have shown great interest in acquiring up to 25 IA-58A for delivery in 1974.

The first foreign contract was in February 1978 with the Islamic Air Force of Mauritania for four IA-58A planes plus support and training at a full cost of U$10.8 million. Another eight units were also negotiated as options. When Mauritanian President Moktar Ould Daddah was ousted in a coup d&#x27;état, the contract was cancelled. The plane series n°015 to n°018 were built and ready to ship with Mauritanian registration numbers. They were incorporated to the Argentine Air Force as A-515 to A-518 keeping the desert camouflage and configuration.

In March 1983, negotiations for two Pucarás were going with Central African Republic Air Force for US$9.5 million including support, training and spare parts. The contract was cancelled.

In September 1983, another contract was signed, this time with the Venezuelan Air Force for 24 IA-58A equipped with Garrett TPE331-11-601W turboprop engines, at U$110 million. Venezuela cancelled the purchase order. A number of OV-10A Broncos were negotiated and later incorporated from the USAF stocks instead, with credit facilities.

In March 1985, a new contract with the Iraqi Air Force, which was later disbanded due political foreign issues, was signed with Iraq for 20 IA-58A with 20 more on option for U$76 million.

In May 1986 the Bolivian Air Force requested 12 IA-58A for U$52 million, with no purchase orders placed.

Iran negotiated 60 IA-58A for U$283 million by April 1987 and at the end of that year a new deal for 50 planes at U$160 million with no purchase orders ever placed.

In November 1987, six Pucarás were negotiated with the Force Aérienne Zairoise for US$26.7 million, contract cancelled.

In 1990 the Brazilian Air Force announced a purchase of 30 IA-58A as part of the project SIVAM. But with the development of the Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano, the order was cancelled.

In 1991 a purchase order was negotiated by the Paraguayan Air Force for four IA-58A at U$10.6 million but later disregarded.

<text>Võ Quý (December 31, 1929 – January 10, 2017) was a Vietnamese zoologist and professor at the Vietnam National University, Hanoi. He was an ornithologist and a recipient of the 2003 Blue Planet Prize.

During the war against the French, he studied in China, but in 1954, he returned to Vietnam and helped to found the University of Hanoi.

He researched the effects of defoliation by the United States in the Vietnam War, and the impact of the herbicides, including Agent Orange used on the environment. He helped to plan government reforestation programmes.

Dr. Quy relocated the rare eastern sarus crane, a species badly affected by the war, and helped to establish a treaty for the protection of migratory birds.

He suggested that the Vietnamese pheasant (&quot;Lophura hatinhensis&quot;) might be a different species from Edward&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Lophura edwardsi&quot;) although most ornithologists do not split these two forms.

He wrote the two-volume book, &quot;The Birds of Vietnam&quot;, and co-authored &quot;The Kouprey: An Action Plan for Its Conservation&quot; . He died in Hanoi on January 10, 2017, at the age of 87.

<text>MediaDefender, Inc. (now Peer Media Technologies) was a company that fought copyright infringement that offered services designed to prevent alleged copyright infringement using peer-to-peer distribution. They used unusual tactics such as flooding peer-to-peer networks with decoy files that tie up users&#x27; computers and bandwidth. MediaDefender was based in Los Angeles, California in the United States. As of March 2007, the company had approximately 60 employees and used 2,000 servers hosted in California with contracts for 9 Gbit/s of bandwidth.

These types of organizations are being hired to attempt to stymie peer-to-peer (P2P) traders through a variety of methods including posting fake files online and recording individuals who contribute copyrighted material, but also marketing to individuals using P2P networks. Clients include Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Virgin Records, HBO, Paramount Pictures, and BMG. On August 1, 2005, the digital media entertainment company ARTISTdirect announced that it had acquired MediaDefender for $42.5 million in cash.

In May 2008, MediaDefender performed a distributed-denial-of-service attack on Revision3, despite the fact that they were not hosting unauthorized materials. Jim Louderback, Revision3&#x27;s CEO, charged that these attacks violated the Economic Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. As of May 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the incident.

In August 2009, ARTISTdirect restructured MediaDefender and MediaSentry, creating Peer Media Technologies.

==Miivi.com==
In February 2007, MediaDefender launched a video sharing site called Miivi.com. On July 4, 2007, file-sharing news site TorrentFreak alleged that Miivi.com was created to trap uploaders of copyrighted content. The site&#x27;s origins were discovered by a blogger who looked up Miivi.com domain registration information.

After the allegation was re-posted throughout the blogosphere, Miivi.com was shut down on July 4, 2007. In an interview with Ars Technica, chief executive Randy Saaf stated that &quot;MediaDefender was working on an internal project that involved video and didn&#x27;t realize that people would be trying to go to it and so we didn&#x27;t password-protect the site&quot;. MediaDefender blamed file-sharing groups such as The Pirate Bay for starting the story. Following MediaDefender&#x27;s subsequent email leak, TorrentFreak alleged that MediaDefender&#x27;s statement was revealed to be a deliberate falsehood. Saaf denied that MiiVi was &quot;a devious product&quot; and that the company aimed to entrap users, stating only that it was part of MediaDefender&#x27;s &quot;trade secrets.&quot;

The MPAA denied any involvement with MediaDefender. On September 14, 2007, internal emails from MediaDefender were leaked on to BitTorrent file sharing networks, which contradicted MediaDefender&#x27;s claims of MiiVi being an &quot;internal test site,&quot; revealing additional detailed information about the website and that the site was closed when the connection between it and MediaDefender became public knowledge. It was scheduled to be re-launched as www.viide.com, but has not yet been opened up to the public.

== Leaked information ==
Beginning on September 14, 2007, MediaDefender experienced a security breach caused by a group of hackers led by high school student &quot;Ethan&quot;. This group called themselves MediaDefender-Defenders. According to an SEC filing, this ultimately cost parent company ARTISTdirect at least $825,000. The breach included emails, a phone conversation, and a number of internal anti-infringement tools, including some source code.

===Leaked e-mails===
On September 14, 2007, 6,621 of the company&#x27;s internal e-mails were leaked, containing information contradicting previous statements and details of strategies intended to deceive copyright infringers. The emails link MediaDefender to projects that management previously denied involvement in. The Associated Press and other media outlets suggest that the leak may confirm speculation that MiiVi.com was an anti-copyright infringement &quot;honeypot&quot; site. One e-mail suggests using the MiiVi client program to turn users&#x27; PCs into drones for MediaDefender&#x27;s eMule spoofing activities. The leaked e-mails discuss responses to unexpected and negative press, and expose upcoming projects, problems in and around the office, Domino&#x27;s pizza orders, and other personal information about employees. Beyond strategic information, the leak also exposed login information for FTP and MySQL servers, making available a large library of MP3 files likely including artists represented by MediaDefender&#x27;s clients. The emails also revealed that MediaDefender probably was negotiating with the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office to allow them access to information about users accessing pornographic material. As of September 15, 2007, there had been no official response from the company. However, evidence exists that MediaDefender had been employing both legal and illegal actions to remove copies of the leaked emails from their respective hosting sites. In addition to the usual cease-and-desist letters from their legal department, IP addresses that are owned by MediaDefender were found to have been used in denial-of-service attacks against sites hosting the leaked emails.

The e-mails also revealed direction by MediaDefender founder Randy Saaf to have developer Ben Ebert attempt to eliminate the information about MiiVi from MediaDefender&#x27;s English Wikipedia entry. Ebert responds in an email on the same day saying, &quot;I will attempt to get all to miivi removed from wiki. I should easily be able to get It contested. We&#x27;ll see if I can get rid of it.&quot;

=== Leaked phone conversation ===
On September 16, 2007, MediaDefender-Defenders released a 25-minute excerpt of a phone conversation between the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office and MediaDefender as a torrent on The Pirate Bay. MediaDefender-Defenders claims in information released with the phone conversation that they have infiltrated the &quot;internals&quot; of the company.

===Leaked source code===
On September 20, 2007, MediaDefender-Defenders released the source code of TrapperKeeper, MediaDefender&#x27;s decoy systems on The Pirate Bay. A large chunk of MediaDefender&#x27;s software was available by Bittorrent.

==Revision3 controversy==
Revision3 is an Internet television network which distributes video content legally through various means, including the BitTorrent protocol. During the Memorial Day weekend in 2008, Revision3 came under a Denial of Service attack originating from MediaDefender IP addresses. The attack left the company&#x27;s service inaccessible until mid-Tuesday the following week. Revision3 CEO Jim Louderback accused MediaDefender of injecting its decoy files into Revision3&#x27;s BitTorrent service through a vulnerability, then automatically perpetrating the attack after Revision3 increased security.

Randy Saaf defended MediaDefender&#x27;s actions by stating &quot;Our systems were targeting a tracker not even knowing it was Revision3&#x27;s tracker&quot;, adding that the denial-of-service attack resulted when &quot;Revision3 changed some configurations&quot; to their BitTorrent tracker.

<text>A patent office is a governmental or intergovernmental organization which controls the issue of patents. In other words, &quot;patent offices are government bodies that may grant a patent or reject the patent application based on whether the application fulfils the requirements for patentability.&quot;

<doc id="1229697" wikidata="Q5294736" url="?curid=1229697" title="Donald MacAlister">
<text>Sir Donald MacAlister, 1st Baronet of Tarbet (17 May 1854 – 15 January 1934) was a Scottish physician who was Principal and Vice-Chancellor and, later, Chancellor of the University of Glasgow. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles intellectual secret society, from 1876. From 1904 to 1931 he was President of the General Medical Council.

== Early life ==
Donald MacAlister was born in Perth, on 17 May 1854, the son of Daniel MacAlister (also spelt MacAllister), a publisher&#x27;s agent and book-deliverer, living at 2 Earls Dykes in Perth who later went to live in Liverpool to work for Blackie and Son. His mother was Euphemia Kennedy and his younger brother, born in 1856, was Sir John MacAlister. He was cousin to Hugh Macalister. 

He rose in life from humble beginnings via school at the Liverpool Institute for Boys (founded 1825, closed 1985) to achieve the highest score in the final mathematics examinations at the University of Cambridge in 1877. In November 1877, he was elected a Fellow of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

He was a native speaker of Gaelic.

==Academic career and later life==
MacAlister remained a fellow of St. John&#x27;s College until the end of his life, and was senior tutor from 1900 to 1904. In 1879, he published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society on &quot;The Law of the Geometric Mean.&quot; The work was in response to a question put by Francis Galton and contains what is now called the log-normal distribution.

After a spell teaching mathematics at Harrow School, MacAlister returned to his original intention of studying medicine, first at Cambridge, later in 1879 at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, and for a short time at Leipzig. In 1881, he settled in Cambridge, and took up medical teaching, investigation, and practice, and in 1884, when he graduated M.D., became a physician at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital. He was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1886. He was the Gulstonian Lecturer in 1887.

In addition to his great talent in mathematics and his accomplishments in medicine, MacAlister was also an extraordinary linguist. In addition to his native Gaelic and English, he was said to have spoken well German, Norse, French, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Czech, Basque, Turkish, Greek, Arabic, Swedish, Russian, Serbian, Afrikaans and Romany: nineteen languages total.

MacAlister was a contemporary at St. John&#x27;s of the first Japanese graduate of Cambridge named Kikuchi Dairoku and they were lifelong friends. MacAlister also assisted Inagaki Manjiro with a petition to the Council of the Senate to allow Japanese students to obtain exemption from the study of Latin and Greek for entrance examinations.

MacAlister played a very important part in the work of the General Medical Council (GMC). He was elected to it in 1889 as representative of Cambridge University and became its president in 1904. In 1931, after an unbroken twenty-seven years in office, he stood down on grounds of ill health.

In 1907, MacAlister was appointed Principal of the University of Glasgow, in place of Very Rev Robert Herbert Story, a position from which he retired in 1929. During those years, the university grew substantially. Upon his resignation, he was elected Chancellor of the university by the General Council.

MacAlister took a leading part in the university business of the country. He was one of the founders of the Universities Bureau of the British Empire, and was for many years Chairman of the Standing Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the British universities.

MacAlister&#x27;s work was widely recognised; he received honorary doctorates from thirteen universities and was appointed KCB in 1908 and created a baronet, of Tarbert, Cantire, in the County of Argyll, in 1924.

In 1917, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Ralph Allan Sampson, Frederick Orpen Bower, John Horne, and Thomas James Jehu.

He died in 1934 and is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife, Edith Florence Boyle (16 June 1873 – 27 November 1950). They had no children and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death.

<text>Matt Molloy (born 12 January 1947) is an Irish musician, from a region known for producing talented flautists. As a child, he began playing the flute and won the All-Ireland Flute Championship at nineteen. Considered one of the most brilliant Irish musicians, his style that adapts piping techniques to the flute has influenced many contemporary Irish flute players. 
During the 1970s, Molloy was a member of The Bothy Band and its successor, the re-founded Planxty. He joined The Chieftains in 1979, replacing Michael Tubridy. Over the course of his career, Molloy has worked with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Paul Brady, Tommy Peoples, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin and Dónal Lunny. Molloy owns a pub on Bridge Street in Westport, County Mayo where there are regular Irish music sessions.

<text>Strindens Promenade Orchester is a student wind band in Trondheim, Norway. It holds the world record in &quot;speed playing&quot; of John Philip Sousa&#x27;s famous marching song &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. The band calls their speedy rendering of the march &quot;Stars and Stribes&quot;, and performs the march at meetings at the Trondheim Student Society. Set during the fall term of 1999, the record time is 50.9 seconds (nominal time is 3 minutes 50 seconds). For this, the band is noted in the Norwegian edition of the Guinness Book of Records.

The orchestra was founded at Havstein cemetery at 5:04 p.m., April 28th, 1963. This site was chosen because the founders thought that &quot;it was the only place where nobody would be disturbed&quot;. The orchestra celebrates this event twice a year.

<doc id="1229716" wikidata="Q289505" url="?curid=1229716" title="Music of Rajasthan">
<text>This type of music originates from the Rajasthan, one of the states of India and home to several important centers of Indian musical development, including Udaipur, Jodhpur and Jaipur. The region&#x27;s music shares similarities both with nearby areas of India and the other side of the border, in the Pakistani province of Sindh.

==Overview==
Rajasthan has a diverse collection of musician castes, including langas, Sapera, Bhopa, and Manganiar. There are two traditional classes of musicians: the Langas, who stuck mostly exclusively to Muslim audiences and styles, and the Manganiars, who had a more liberal approach.

Traditional music includes the women&#x27;s Panihari songs, which lyrically describes chores, especially centered on water and wells, both of which are an integral part of Rajasthan&#x27;s desert culture. Other songs, played by various castes, normally begin with the alap, which sets the tune and is followed by a recital of a couplet (dooba). Epic ballads tell tales of heroes like Devnarayan Bhagwan, Gogaji, Ramdeoji, Pabuji and Tejaji. The celebration of changing seasons is also very central to folk music of Rajasthan. Celebration of the coming of the Monsoon or the harvest season are central to most traditional folk songs. Songs also revolve around daily activities of the local people-- for instance, a song about not sowing Jeera (Cumin) as it is difficult to tend. Or, for instance, another song about Podina (Mint) and how it is liked by various members of the family (an allegorical reference to a local liquor extracted from mint is also made). Every day common themes are the center of traditional rajasthani folk music.

One of the most famous Rajasthani Maand singers is Allah Jilai Bai of the Bikaner Gharana.

<text>Soraya Ray L. Bañas (born September 23, 1984), better known as Kitkat, is a singer, comedian, TV host, and actress in the Philippines. She is known as &quot;The Stolen Diva&quot; and is managed by Star Magic. Kitkat performs as a stand-up singer and comedian at The Punchline, Laffline, and Metro Comedy Bar. Her first solo concert took place in January 2009 at Metro Bar. She often portrays sidekick roles in television series and movies.

Its Shmiras Halashon programs are in various Orthodox Jewish high schools, primarily those attended by girls.

<text>Sir Brian Gerald Barratt-Boyes (born Brian Gerald Boyes, 13 January 1924 – 8 March 2006) was a pioneering New Zealand cardiothoracic surgeon. He was known for early development of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, early implantation of a cardiac pacemaker before these devices became commercially available in 1961, early use of human cadaveric aortic homografts for aortic valve replacement, and introduced the use of hypothermia and cardiac arrest for surgery in neonates and infants.

==Early life and education==
Barratt-Boyes was born on 13 January 1924 in Wellington, New Zealand. He was educated at Wellington College. After a year at Victoria University College, he studied medicine at Otago&#x27;s Medical School in Dunedin, New Zealand, graduating in 1946. He continued his training as a surgeon, initially in New Zealand, and later at the Mayo Clinic (1953–55) and as a Nuffield Fellow in Bristol (1955–56). At Mayo he worked under John W. Kirklin, the two developing a high mutual regard that endured and grew over the years.

==Career==
In 1956 he was recruited back to Auckland, New Zealand by Sir Douglas Robb, and pioneered the development of cardiopulmonary bypass in that country, the first patient being operated on in 1958. While this task must have been made more difficult by New Zealand&#x27;s relative remoteness and small population, the Green Lane Hospital surgical team quickly achieved an international reputation for innovative excellence. Indeed, he suggested that Auckland&#x27;s isolation conferred an advantage comparable to that enjoyed by the Mayo Clinic in small-town Rochester, Minnesota, making it less likely that day-to-day interruptions would interfere with the real purpose of their work. Much of the original equipment had to be fashioned or modified locally. Sid Yarrow, an engineer on the team, built an early external pacemaker for intra-operative use. The first permanent unit, from Medtronic, was implanted in 1961.

In 1962 he introduced, independently but simultaneously with Donald Ross in London, the human cadaveric aortic homograft for aortic valve replacement and for many years he worked to perfect valve preparation, emphasizing its inherent physiologic advantages and simplifying its surgical implant technique. He and his team&#x27;s results became the standard for others to match.

In 1969 he brought the technique of profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest into the limelight as a practical method for dealing with major corrective surgery in neonates with congenital heart disease, in so doing further establishing Green Lane Hospital on the international stage. In recognition of these and other achievements he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year Honours, and promoted to Knight Commander of the same order in the 1971 New Year Honours, further confirming a national prominence comparable to that achieved by René Favaloro in Argentina and Christiaan Barnard in South Africa. Barratt-Boyes showcased the Green Lane experience at many international meetings as well as in workshops he hosted in Auckland. The 1987 Asian Pacific Congress was a particular success for him for the size of the international contingent it drew and the bright spotlight it shone on Green Lane&#x27;s history of achievement. In 1985 he and John Kirklin published their authoritative text &quot;Cardiac Surgery&quot;, a colossal achievement of more than 1,500 pages that quickly became the standard reference for the sub-speciality.

==Personal life and death==
Barratt-Boyes married physiotherapist Norma Margaret Thomson in Dunedin on 9 November 1949. The couple went on to have five sons. In 1986, Barratt-Boyes and his first wife were divorced, and he married Australian lawyer Sara Rose Monester. His first wife, Norma, died on 10 November 2016.

Barratt-Boyes suffered from angina beginning at age 39 and underwent coronary artery bypass surgery at age 50. He was a long time smoker and struggled with quitting. Barratt-Boyes died on 8 March 2006 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, from complications following valve replacement surgery by Dr. Toby Cosgrove at Cleveland Clinic.

<doc id="1229729" wikidata="Q1410132" url="?curid=1229729" title="The Bothy Band">
<text>The Bothy Band are an Irish traditional band, originally active during the mid 1970s. They quickly gained a reputation as one of the most influential bands playing Irish traditional music. Their enthusiasm and musical virtuosity had a significant influence on the Irish traditional music movement that continued well after they disbanded in 1979.

==History==
===Formation===
The Bothy Band was formed in 1975 by bouzouki player Dónal Lunny, after he left the group Planxty to form his own record company, Mulligan. Lunny invited uilleann piper Paddy Keenan, flute and whistle player Matt Molloy, fiddler Paddy Glackin, and accordion player Tony MacMahon to get involved in an early project for the new label. This group of players was soon joined by a brother and sister who played in the Irish traditional group Skara Brae: Mícheál Ó Domhnaill on acoustic guitar and Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill on clavinet and vocals. Originally called Seachtar (Irish for &quot;seven&quot;), the group was renamed by Mícheál Ó Domhnaill after Tony MacMahon left the group to work as a producer for BBC. The Bothy Band made its debut on 2 February 1975 at Trinity College, Dublin.

===Three studio album career===
In 1975 the Bothy Band released their eponymous first album on Mulligan Records (in Ireland; Green Linnet Records in the US; Polydor Records in the UK). Described on RTE as &#x27;an incendiary mix of driving folk-rock rhythms&#x27; and &#x27;a game-changer of an album&#x27;, it established their reputation as a significant musical force in Irish traditional music. In 1976, they released their second album, &quot;Old Hag You Have Killed Me&quot;, which was praised as &#x27;a benchmark of the genre&#x27; of Irish music and expanded their following. In 1977, they recorded what would be their last studio album, &quot;Out of the Wind – Into the Sun&quot;. In 1979, the Bothy Band released a live album, &quot;After Hours (Live in Paris)&quot;.

During their four years together, the Bothy Band featured a variety of fiddlers. Original fiddler Glackin was replaced by Donegal fiddler Tommy Peoples on the band&#x27;s début album. Peoples in turn was replaced by Sligo-influenced fiddler Kevin Burke on the second release. They played their final gig with this lineup at the 3rd Boys of Ballisodare Festival on 10 August 1979.

===After the Bothy Band break-up===
After the group disbanded in 1979, the members continued to play influential musical roles in the Irish traditional music movement. Lunny returned to Planxty along with Molloy, and then later helped form the Celtic rock band Moving Hearts. He continued working as a record producer and later joined Andy Irvine to form the group Mozaik, releasing two albums in 2004 and 2007. After recording two albums with Planxty, Molloy joined The Chieftains. After several solo projects with Ó Domhnaill, Burke founded Patrick Street with Irvine and Jackie Daly (formerly of De Dannan). Ó Domhnaill and Ní Dhomhnaill went on to form Relativity and Nightnoise.

In 1994, previously unreleased concert recordings from the 1970s were released as &quot;BBC Radio One – The Bothy Band Live in Concert&quot;. The music had been recorded in two different locations on different dates – 15 July 1976, at the BBC&#x27;s Paris Theatre in London, and 24 July 1978, at the National Theatre, Kilburn. The first nine tracks, from the Paris Theatre concert, feature Peter Browne on pipes as a stand-in for Paddy Keenan.

===2007 tribute concert===
Following the death of Mícheál Ó Domhnaill in July 2006, the surviving members of the Bothy Band came together at the tribute concert &quot;Ómós- A Gig for Mícheál&quot;, held on 24 May 2007 at Vicar Street in Dublin. All proceeds from the concert went to the Irish Traditional Music Archive.

===2023 - 2024 Reunion===
The group reunited again in 2023, initially for a television documentary, which led to a full Irish tour in 2024. the lineup included all surviving members, including both Paddy Glackin and Kevin Burke on fiddle, joined by guest musician Seán Óg Graham on guitar. The tour was ultimately cut short due to health issues experienced by Dónal Lunny, but the band were hopeful of re-scheduling concerts for 2025.

<doc id="1229733" wikidata="Q4052127" url="?curid=1229733" title="Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Intellectual Property Office of the United Kingdom (often referred to as the UK IPO) is, since 2 April 2007, the operating name of The Patent Office. It is the official government body responsible for intellectual property rights in the UK and is an executive agency of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).

== Responsibilities ==
The IPO has direct administrative responsibility for examining and issuing or rejecting patents, and maintaining registers of intellectual property including patents, designs and trade marks in the UK. As in most countries, there is no statutory register of copyright and the IPO does not conduct any direct administration in copyright matters.

The IPO is led by the Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who is also Registrar of Trade Marks, Registrar of Designs and Chief Executive of the IPO:

* ca. 1989-1999 Paul Hartnack 
* 1999–2003Alison Brimelow (afterwards President of the European Patent Office)
* 2004-2007Ron Marchant
* 2007–2010Ian Fletcher
* 2010–2016John Alty
* 2017–2022Tim Moss
* 1 September 2022 – presentAdam Williams

=== Substantive duties ===
The existence of the Patent Office and the post of Comptroller-General are required by the Patents and Design Act 1907 (though most of the remainder of this Act has been repealed), but the substantive duties of the IPO are set out in other legislation, including:

* The Registered Designs Act 1949
* The Patents Act 1977
* The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
* The Trade Marks Act 1994

Each of these Acts of Parliament has been extensively amended since it was first passed.

===Manual of Patent Practice===
The Manual of Patent Practice sets out the relevant patent law and the operational practice of the Intellectual Property Office in relation to patents.

== History ==

The forerunner of the Patent Office, the Office of the Commissioners for Patents, was established by the Patent Law Amendment Act 1852 and opened on 1 October that year. While this is claimed as the date the modern Intellectual Property Office was created it was in fact created later, along with the office of the comptroller under section 82 of the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act 1883 (46 &amp; 47 Vict. c. 57).

There had been a Patent Bill Office, under the control of the Attorney General, which was part of the old patent system. It had been located in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

Significantly, the process of applying for a patent was extremely complicated and largely set up to ensure fees were paid to various officials (patent fees formed a significant part of the stipend of the Attorney and Solicitor General). The Patent Law Amendment Act 1852 brought the process of patent grant into a single office serving the whole of the United Kingdom (where previously a petitioner had had to apply and pay fees to several offices, and to obtain separate patents for each of the UK&#x27;s constituent nations).

Initially, people applying for a patent often used to submit a detailed model of their submission; these were retained and the collection became known as the Patent Museum (opened to the public in 1863 in South Kensington, it went on to become a core collection of the new Science Museum there).

== Location ==
From its early days, the Patent Office was based in the Chancery Lane area of London, where it eventually spread to fill the area between Furnival Street and Southampton Buildings. The principal entrance was at 25 Southampton Buildings, where a purpose-built headquarters was constructed in 1899–1902 (architect: Sir John Taylor). The principal interior space was the Library, a &quot;harsh but spectacular space 140ft long, lit from skylights and a clerestory, with two tiers of steel-framed, fireproofed galleries on cast iron Corinthian columns&quot;. Designed to allow members of the public to consult patent records, it also contained a very extensive collection of technical and scientific publications, which in 1967 was transferred to the British Library.

In 1991, having outgrown its original premises, the Patent Office moved to Newport, South East Wales, where the IPO headquarters remains to this day. A small branch office in London has been maintained for the benefit of the large professional community based there and for communication with central government.

<doc id="1229735" wikidata="Q211551" url="?curid=1229735" title="Nikolai Morozov (revolutionary)">
<text>Nikolai Aleksandrovich Morozov (; 7 July 1854, Borok – 30 July 1946) was a Russian revolutionary who spent about 25 years in prison for revolutionary activities against the Tsarist government. He was also an academic, publishing works in various fields of science and history, and a pioneer of aviation in Russia. At age 88, he briefly served in the Red Army as a sniper during World War II, becoming the oldest known combatant of the war.

== Early life and revolutionary activities ==

The son of a wealthy landowner and a serf woman who was bonded to his estate, Morozov was born in the village of Borok in the Governorate of Yaroslavl. He was initially educated at home before he started studying at the Second Moscow Gymnasium in 1869. He disliked the curriculum, especially Latin and divine law. He founded an informal self-education circle in natural science. He also attended lectures at Moscow University disguised in a student&#x27;s uniform. He was expelled from school for distributing a science journal that had not been approved by the censorship division. Showing an early interest in politics, he was on a police watchlist as a student. He joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky and was active in distributing propaganda among peasants in the Moscow, Voronezh, and Kursk governorates before police persecution forced him to return to Moscow. He moved to Saint Petersburg before departing for Geneva in 1874.

In 1875, he returned to Russia and was arrested at the border but released after his father paid his bail. He again devoted himself to revolutionary activities, distributing propaganda among the peasants of Saratov governorate.

In 1878, having returned to Saint Petersburg, Morozov was a member of &quot;Land and Liberty&quot; group where he co-edited their mouthpiece, &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;, (with Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky). When the group faced an internal crisis over tactics, it split into two groups in August 1879. Morozov rejected the continued use of propaganda to bring about social change and, instead, advocated for use of direct action. He joined the more radical of the two factions, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; (People&#x27;s Will), eventually becoming one of its leaders.

In 1880, Olga Lyubatovich and Morozov left &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; and went to live in Geneva and London, where he was introduced to Karl Marx. While in exile, Morozov wrote &quot;The Terrorist Struggle&quot;, a pamphlet that explained his views on how to achieve a democratic society in Russia. He advocated for large numbers of small, independent terrorist groups and argued that this approach would make it difficult for the Tsarist secret police to apprehend the terrorists. This would also help to prevent a small group of leaders gaining power, forming oligarchical dictatorships after the overthrow of the Tsar.

Morozov returned to Russia in order to distribute &quot;The Terrorist Struggle&quot; on January 28, 1881, but was arrested at the border. He was imprisoned in Suwałki. Lyubatovich, having only just gone through childbirth, decided to attempt to rescue Morozov. However, her plan did not go well, and she was arrested and sent to Siberia in November 1882.

== Later career and ideas ==

Between 1882 and 1905, Morozov was imprisoned in Peter and Paul Fortress (in Saint Petersburg) and in Shlisselburg Fortress for his political activities. During this period, he wrote political verse and began intense studies in the fields of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and history. After receiving permission to use theological literature, he learned Hebrew and began an in-depth study of Biblical history. After his release in 1905, he taught chemistry and astronomy at the University of Saint Petersburg. He participated in the October 1907 Russian legislative election and won election as a member of the Duma, but the authorities re-ran the election in the Mologsky District, thus preventing the former prisoner from taking his seat. He became a member of many scientific associations, including the Russian Aero-club. For the publication of his book &quot;Songs of the Stars&quot; in 1910, he was imprisoned for another year (1912 to 1913).

Many of his ideas were considered unorthodox and daring. He conjectured that atoms have a complicated level structure and may be transformed. In his treatise on the periodic table, Morozov predicted the discovery of inert elements.

In 1907, Morozov published &quot;The Revelation in Storm and Thunder&quot; in which he produced evidence for his hypotheses:
* The Revelation to John can be dated astronomically to 30 September 395.
* The author of the Revelation is identical with John Chrysostom ( – 407).

Morozov became a pioneer of aeronautics in Russia in the 1910s. He flew airplanes and balloons, including over the Shlisselburg Fortress where he had been imprisoned, and lectured at an aviation school. He proposed a parachute system which would open automatically, and special suits for high-altitude flights. During World War I, Morozov went to the front in 1915 as a delegate of the All-Russian Zemstvo Union to aid the sick and wounded.

After the October Revolution of November 1917, Morozov took little interest in politics; he never joined the Communist Party. However, Anatoly Lunacharsky (Commissar for Education from 1917 to 1929) appointed him in 1918 to run the ) in Petrograd (Leningrad), a position which Morozov kept until his death at the age of 92. Based on the astronomical records such as the &quot;Almagest&quot;, he speculated that much of human history has been falsified. His theories about the chronology of the Middle East and Israel before the first century BCE later attracted the attention of Anatoly Fomenko (1945- ), who based his own New Chronology upon them.

In his declining years, Morozov established a laboratory in his native Borok, north of Uglich, to monitor and study &quot;inland waters&quot;. In 1932 he was named an Honorary Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. 

In 1942, Morozov, then aged 88, enlisted in the Red Army to fight in the German-Soviet War. He had taken a sniper course in 1939 and claimed to be working on a new telescopic sight which needed field-testing, threatening that if he was not allowed to enlist he would ask Joseph Stalin himself to intervene. The military leadership gave in and enlisted him. In December 1942, he was assigned to a battalion in the Volkhov area during the Siege of Leningrad as a sniper. He shot accurately despite needing glasses and, in one instance, spent half a day lying in ambush in the snow before killing a German officer. He used his academic training to enhance his effectiveness as a sniper, studying the trajectory of his bullets and making adjustments for humidity and wind. After a month he was pulled from the front line - despite his protests. He unsuccessfully demanded to be returned to the front several months later. He was awarded the Medal &quot;For the Defence of Leningrad&quot; and the Order of Lenin in 1944.

Morozov died on 30 July, 1946 at the age of 92.

His memorial house in Borok, close to his grave site, is open to the public. The asteroid 1210 Morosovia is named in his honor.

<text>Aleksei Ivanovich Musin-Pushkin (Russian:Алексей Иванович Мусин-Пушкин; 27 March 1744, Moscow - 13 February 1817, Moscow) was a Russian statesman and historian, known for his large art and book collections. He is credited with discovering the only known manuscript of &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; in 1795.

== Biography ==
He was born to Ivan Yakovlevich Musin-Pushkin (1710–1799), a Guard Captain, and his wife, Natalia Mikhailovna, née Priklonskaya. He graduated from the artillery school in Saint Petersburg, then served as the Adjutant to General Grigory Orlov. In 1772, when the General was discharged, at his own request, for health reasons, Musin-Pushkin went on an extended tour of Europe; visiting Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and England. When he returned in 1775, he was appointed a Master of Ceremonies at the Imperial Court. In 1781, he married Ekaterina Wolkonskaya (1754-1829), daughter of Major-General . They had three sons and five daughters.

In 1785, he became an honorary member of the Imperial Academy of Arts; elevated to full member in 1789. As an avid collector of historical memorabilia, he made a major acquisition in 1791; a large part of the , with documents from the reign of Peter the Great and Medieval manuscripts; including the &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot;, as well as maps from the 16th and 17th centuries. Later, he was able to acquire the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot;.

That same year, Empress Catherine the Great named him Procuror (representative) for the Holy Synod; charging him with the collection of important documents and manuscripts from churches and monasteries throughout Russia. Local administrators were notified, and he received over 100 items the first year. In 1793, he became a Privy Councilor. Numerous other collections from nobles and scholars were added over the years.

In 1795, following the death of Ivan Betskoy, he succeeded to the position of President of the Imperial Academy. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of a new building, designed by Alexander Kokorinov and Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe. He also reorganized the class structure, and sought new sponsors. His professorial appointments were predominantly Russian, rather than German. A notable exception was Ignaz Sebastian Klauber, from Augsburg, who was brought in to head the engraving department. To help with finances, he proposed that students should pay half of the proceeds from the sale of their works to the Academy&#x27;s treasury, but this was met with too much resistance. Later, he initiated annual exhibitions, with cash prizes from his own salary. In 1796, he was awarded the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky.

The following year, having been made a Count and Senator, he resigned; settling in Moscow with his book and art collections. In 1807 the historian, convinced him that his collections should be donated to the , managed by the Collegium of Foreign Affairs. This was never done. As a result, they were destroyed in 1812, during the Great Moscow Fire. Only a few pieces which had been lent or given to other people survived, including the &quot;Laurentian Codex&quot;, which had been presented to Emperor Alexander I. He attempted to restore the collection, but acquired very little before his death in 1817, aged seventy-two.

<text>Gila Almagor Agmon (; born Gila Alexandrowitz; July 22, 1939) is an Israeli actress, film star, and author. In Israel, she is known as &quot;queen of the Israeli cinema and theatre&quot;.

==Biography==
Gila Alexandrowitz (Almagor) was born in Petah Tikva to Jewish emigrant parents from Europe. Her German-Jewish father Max Alexandrowitz was killed by an Arab sniper while working as a policeman in Haifa four months before she was born. Her mother Chaya was from a Polish Orthodox Jewish family. Almagor grew up caring for her mother, who was slowly losing her sanity after realising that all her family in Europe had been murdered in the Holocaust. When her mother was institutionalized in 1954, Almagor was sent to Hadassim youth village.

Two years later, she moved to Tel Aviv, rented a room near Habima Theatre, and applied to acting school. Although she was underage, she was accepted.

At the age of 17, Almagor debuted in Habima&#x27;s production of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;. Her autobiographical books &quot;Summer of Aviya&quot; and &quot;Under the Domim Tree&quot; were both made into films, with Almagor playing her own mother. She was married to Yaakov Agmon, former director of the Habima Theatre, until his death in 2020. They have two children.

==Stage, film and television==
Almagor has played leading roles in many plays, among them &quot;Anne Frank&quot;, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, &quot;The Bride and the Butterfly Hunt&quot;, &quot;They Were All My Children&quot;, and &quot;Medea&quot;. She has appeared in over 50 films, including &quot;Siege&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Road&quot;, &quot;The House on Chelouche Street&quot;, &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, &quot;El Dorado&quot;, &quot;Life According to Agfa&quot; and &quot;The Summer of Aviya&quot;.

Almagor starred as the mother of Avner, the main character in the 2005 film &quot;Munich&quot;. She also appears in &quot;The Debt&quot;, about a former Mossad agent who comes back to kill an escaped Nazi doctor. In 2008, she played the role of Lolah Baum in the 100-episode serial &quot;Dani Hollywood&quot;, broadcast on the Yes satellite network. In 2005, Almagor played a therapist in the award-winning Israeli television series &quot;BeTipul&quot;.

==Charity work and public service==
Almagor founded the &quot;Gila Almagor Wish Fund&quot;, a charity for sick children, and co-founded AMI – the Israeli Artist Association. She currently serves as chair of cultural activities in the City Council of Tel Aviv and many other boards to promote the arts for children and in efforts to make international exchange between the Israeli performing arts world and abroad.

==Awards and critical acclaim==
Almagor has received 10 Kinor David awards for her work in film and theater.

She received the Life Achievement Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 1996, a Life Achievement Award from the Israeli Academy of Cinema in 1997, and the Silver Bear award for best actress in &quot;Summer of Aviya&quot; at the Berlin Film Festival.

In 1995, Almagor received a National Jewish Book Award for &quot;Under the Domin Tree.&quot;

In 1993, she was a member of the jury at the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1996, she was a member of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1990, she was chosen Actress of the Decade by &quot;Yediot Ahronoth&quot; and the Israel Film Institute. In 2004, she was awarded the Israel Prize, for cinema. In 2005, she received a Hans Christian Andersen Ambassadorship. In 2007, she was awarded the Liberitas Film Festival Prize for Lifetime Achievement (Croatia). In 2009, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Tel Aviv University awarded her an honorary doctorate.

<doc id="1229750" wikidata="Q338658" url="?curid=1229750" title="Accelerated Evolution">
<text>Accelerated Evolution is the sixth studio album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend, released in 2003. The album, written and produced by Townsend, was a mix of musical styles from alternative rock to hard rock to progressive metal. Townsend, the lead vocalist and guitarist, assembled a group of Vancouver musicians to perform with him on the album: guitarist Brian Waddell, drummer Ryan Van Poederooyen, bassist Mike Young, and keyboardist Dave Young. This lineup, the Devin Townsend Band, was Townsend&#x27;s first dedicated lineup for his solo material, and was created as a counterpart to Townsend&#x27;s extreme metal project Strapping Young Lad.

&quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; was written and recorded at the same time as Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s self-titled album, with Townsend dividing his energy between the two. &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia from September to November 2002, and was released on Townsend&#x27;s independent label, HevyDevy Records, in March 2003. The album was well received by critics for its blend of genres and influences, its musical accessibility, and its large-scale rock production style.

==Background==
During the creation of his early solo albums &quot;Infinity&quot; (1998) and &quot;Physicist&quot; (2000), Devin Townsend went through personal struggles that affected his writing ability. These struggles were resolved on &quot;Terria&quot; (2001), which Townsend described as &quot;a really healing record&quot;. After &quot;Terria&quot;, Townsend felt a newfound enthusiasm for his music, saying, &quot;Bring it on. I&#x27;m going to be so fucking sensitive but so intense, and be unafraid to be either.&quot; In 2002, Townsend began work on his next two albums. He reunited his extreme metal project Strapping Young Lad, which had been on hiatus for four years, and began writing the band&#x27;s new release, &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; (&quot;SYL&quot;).

At the same time, Townsend formed a new, permanent band &quot;on par with Strapping&quot; to record and tour for his solo releases. The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian Waddell on guitar, Ryan Van Poederooyen on drums, and brothers Mike Young and Dave Young on bass and keyboards, respectively. Townsend performed guitar, vocals, and production, as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend chose members of local bands who &quot;hadn&#x27;t had the same experiences&quot; and could give a fresh perspective on &quot;all those emotions&quot; that were present in his solo material. He found it &quot;refreshing&quot; to play with people who appreciated his solo material more than Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s. Notable was the absence of drummer Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad, who had played on Townsend&#x27;s previous three solo albums.

Townsend wrote and produced the band&#x27;s first album at the same time he was working on &quot;SYL&quot;, spending half the week on one and half on the other. The album was engineered and mixed by Townsend and Shaun Thingvold, who has worked on many of Townsend&#x27;s and Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s albums. It had the working title &quot;Relationships&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot;, a nod to the frantic pace of putting a new band together in under a year.

==Music==
&quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; was written as &quot;the polar opposite&quot; of &quot;SYL&quot;. The album blended aspects of different genres, including alternative rock, hard rock, and progressive metal, with elements of &quot;heaviness, ambience, humor, and experimentalism&quot;. The album has been described as more melodic and more rock-based than &quot;SYL&quot; or &quot;Physicist&quot;, yet &quot;more song-oriented&quot; than &quot;Terria&quot;, with influences by John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, and Rush. Songs such as &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Suicide&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot; were compared to Townsend&#x27;s &quot;Infinity&quot;, but were noted as &quot;less frantic and more mature&quot;; Despite this, &quot;Deadhead&quot; derived its name from an extreme industrial metal track with the same title from Godflesh&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Streetcleaner&quot;. Townsend wrote the album to be &quot;commercially viable&quot;, making his existing style more concise and accessible but without going so far as to write &quot;pop songs&quot;. Townsend utilized clean vocals much more than in his previous albums, and produced and mixed the album in his trademark &quot;wall of sound&quot; style, blending &quot;layers upon layers of guitars, keyboards, and vocals&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; was released in March 2003 on Townsend&#x27;s independent label, HevyDevy Records. It is distributed in Canada by HevyDevy, in Japan by Sony, and in Europe and North America by InsideOut. The album art was created by Travis Smith, who also did the art for &quot;Terria&quot; and &quot;SYL&quot;. InsideOut also released a special edition of the album which contained a 3-track EP called &quot;Project EKO&quot;, Townsend&#x27;s first foray into electronica. The album reached number 135 on the French albums chart and number 249 on the Japanese albums chart.

Prior to the formation of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup; the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot;, Townsend began touring with The Devin Townsend Band, at times separately from Strapping Young Lad and at times sharing the bill. After playing two release shows in Vancouver in July 2003, The Devin Townsend Band toured Canada with Strapping Young Lad and Zimmers Hole in October 2003. This was followed by a North American tour with progressive metal band Symphony X through November and December 2003.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; was well received by critics. Mike G. of &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; called &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; &quot;the album of the year&quot;, praising it for &quot;the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy &#x27;n&#x27; rockin&#x27; yet majestic and beautiful.&quot; William Hughes of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; called it &quot;amazing&quot;, saying the album &quot;has elements that will appeal to fans of all different genres, from progressive to metal.&quot; Alex Henderson of &quot;Allmusic&quot; called the album &quot;excellent&quot;, and praised Townsend&#x27;s ability to blend genres and influences: &quot;The Canadian rocker provides enough downtuned guitars to put this CD in the alt rock category. And yet &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; has a big sound that suggests the pop-metal, arena rock and hard rock of the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s – big melodies, big harmonies, big guitars, big vocals, big production.&quot; Chris Hawkins of &quot;KNAC.com&quot; said, &quot;Like always, what Devin manages to do is take the most infectious rhythm, place his stamp upon it, and thus create something completely original.&quot; Xander Hoose of &quot;Chronicles of Chaos&quot; compared the album favorably to &quot;SYL&quot;, noting that &quot;there is more variation, and the songs are more memorable and layered than their one-dimensional &quot;SYL&quot; counterparts.&quot; Hoose added, &quot;For those who thought &quot;Terria&quot; was going too much in the wrong direction, &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; will probably come as a relief.&quot;

<text>Shanghai Shenhua Football Club () is a Chinese professional football club based in Shanghai, that competes in . Shanghai Shenhua plays its home matches at the Shanghai Stadium, located within Xuhui District. The owner of Shanghai Shenhua F.C. is Shanghai Jiushi Group, a state-owned cultural and sports operation company in Shanghai. Shanghai Shenhua is one of the four clubs to have never been relegated from the Chinese top-flight since the Chinese Super League&#x27;s foundation in 2004. The term &quot;shen hua&quot; literally translates as &quot;the Flower of Shanghai&quot; in English – &quot;shen&quot; is one of the alternative names for Shanghai and &quot;hua&quot; means flower in Chinese. 

The club&#x27;s predecessor was the municipal-run semi-pro club Shanghai F.C.. The team predominantly played in the top tier, where they won several domestic league and cup titles. On 10 December 1993, the club was reorganized to become a completely professional football club so they could play in the 1994 Chinese Jia-A League season, making them one of the founding members of the first fully professional top-tier leagues in China. Since then, they have won one league title and four Chinese FA Cups.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Shenhua was the 6th most valuable football team in China, with a team value of $106 million, and an estimated revenue of $29 million in 2015.

==History==
===Early club===
Shanghai Shenhua&#x27;s predecessor was originally called East China, a team name used as far back as 1910 for football in the multi-sport event Chinese National Games. The local Shanghai government sports body decided to use this name for their new club, founded on 1 November 1951, to take part in China&#x27;s first fully nationalized national football league tournament, where they finished second in the league that year. The football league gradually expanded and the team was allowed to name themselves after their own province of Shanghai in 1957. Soon afterwards, by 1961, Shanghai started to establish themselves as a major football team within China when they won their first league title. This was then quickly followed by their second league title in 1962. However, in 1966, because of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, football in China was halted and Shanghai was unable to play. When football returned in China, Shanghai was able to return to the top tier. However, they were unable to regain any of the dominance that they had previously shown and were even relegated in 1980. Though they were able to be quickly promoted in the following season, they spent many years without actually winning any titles until Wang Houjun led them to win the Chinese FA Cup in 1991, which was their first trophy in 29 years.

===Professionalism===
Throughout the 1990s, the Chinese Football Association was demanding more professionalism from their football teams and while many were semi-professional, Shanghai would be one of the first when they gathered sponsorship from Yu Zhifei and the local company named Shenhua (&quot;Flower of Shanghai&quot;) on 10 December 1993, founding Shanghai Shenhua. 
This then saw Shanghai hire their first professional manager in Xu Genbao, who was the previous China national team manager, in 1994. The move would quickly see Shanghai win the second professional football league title by the end of the 1995 league season.
When Xu left, Shanghai attempted to bring in several foreign coaches to add more experience to the team. However, few achieved any success despite being close on several occasions, except for Muricy Ramalho&#x27;s brief spell when the club won the 1998 Chinese FA Cup.
By the end of 2001, the Shenhua group ended their sponsorship of the club and were replaced by SVA and the Shanghai Media &amp; Entertainment Group. The club changed its name to Shanghai Shenhua SVA SMEG Football Club. The team, however, remained unique as it still retained &quot;Shenhua&quot; in its name, whereas many other teams dropped the name of their former sponsors completely.
On the pitch, the club would take over Shanghai 02, a youth football team set up by Xu Genbao, while also bringing in a new manager in Wu Jingui, who built a new squad predominantly using many from the Shanghai 02 squad and despite struggling in his debut season, he was able to win the league title in 2003. Critics would dispute the legitimacy of the title win after it was discovered in 2011 that the referee Lu Jun was bribed by the head of the CFA&#x27;s referee arrangements, Zhang Jianqiang, to be biased towards Shenhua in a vital match against Shanghai COSCO Sanlin in a game that Shenhua won 4–1. Lu Jun and Zhang Jianqiang were both officially charged with match-fixing, while Shenhua&#x27;s general manager Lou Shifang was discovered to be the person who orchestrated the bribes. Initially, despite this indiscretion, the club was spared any disciplinary action. The reason provided by the CFA at the time for the leniency was that they would be punishing the individuals who put the game in disrepute and not the club; because Lou Shifang was Shenhua&#x27;s offending participant and had left the club several years before the allegations were confirmed, it would have been harsh to punish the club retrospectively. On 18 February 2013, The CFA would decide to change its mind on Shenhua and retrospectively decided to punish the club by revoking its 2003 league title, fining the club with 1 million Yuan and giving a 6-point deduction at the beginning of the 2013 Chinese Super League season after it was discovered that they also fixed another game against Shaanxi National Power en route to winning the 2003 league title.

===Zhu Jun era===
In 2007, the owner of inner-city rival Shanghai United, Zhu Jun and his company The9 Limited, bought a majority share of Shanghai Shenhua and began to merge Shanghai United into Shanghai Shenhua. His first act was to replace the previously successful existing head coach Wu Jingui with Shanghai United&#x27;s Osvaldo Giménez. The appointment was to prove highly disruptive and Wu Jingui was quickly brought back as the head coach after only a few months, but was sacked on 9 September 2008. Jia Xiuquan took over his position on the same day. This was followed by the club adding to their backroom staff when, on 1 January 2009, Shenhua made Chinese football history by becoming the first Chinese team to hire a foreign CEO and a technical director. The club hired former manager Osvaldo Gimenez as their chief executive officer. One day later, former PSV Eindhoven technical director Stan Valckx joined Shenhua in the same position.

 After a disappointing 2011 season in the Chinese Super League, Zhu Jun decided to bring in a marquee player, so on 12 December 2011, it was confirmed that Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka would be arriving in Shanghai in January 2012, while six days later, it was announced that his compatriot Jean Tigana would be the head coach from the 2012 season. Tigana was fired after a string of poor results and was replaced by former Argentina national team coach Sergio Batista to lead the team. After a successful season playing for Chelsea and winning the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, Ivorian striker Didier Drogba signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Shenhua. This was soon followed by the signing of Colombian international footballer Giovanni Moreno from Argentinian club Racing Club. These signings were intended to boost the club&#x27;s title challenge and see Zhu Jun&#x27;s investment within the club reach 150 million Yuan, which he believed gave him a controlling stake of 70 percent, as promised by the other shareholders. When the other shareholders decided not to agree to this arrangement, Zhu Jun decided to pull his funding of the club, which resulted in the team finishing in a disappointing ninth place and both Anelka and Drogba leaving the club. The relationship between Zhu Jun and the other shareholders became even more fractious at the beginning of the 2013 league season when the Chinese FA issued the club with a six-point deduction for match-fixing ten years prior and a fine of one million Yuan. This would lead to a shareholder dispute between the other shareholders SVA, Shanghai Media Group, Shanghai Electric Group, and Huangpu SASAC on who should pay for this fine, which saw a gap in the club finances that saw Rolando Schiavi, Patricio Toranzo, and Giovanni Moreno refuse to play the 31 March 2013, league game against Liaoning Whowin because of unpaid wages.

===Greenland===
The Zhu Jun era ended on 31 January 2014, when the club was purchased by Greenland Holding Group Company Limited who bought a share of 28.5% of the club. On 6 February 2014, Greenland Holding Group Company Limited announced that the club&#x27;s official name would be changed to &quot;Shanghai Greenland FC, Shanghai Greenland Shenhua team&quot; and it was hoped that by retaining Shenhua within the official team name, it would appease the fans by reflecting on the club&#x27;s heritage. This did not work. Subsequent badge alterations which eliminated Shenhua from the team&#x27;s logo drew significant criticism from many of the club&#x27;s supporters, who publicly voiced their dissatisfaction on 9 March 2014, during the league game against Shanghai Shenxin as they saw removing Shenhua from the club&#x27;s name as a stain on the team&#x27;s heritage and history. On 18 July 2014, the club bowed to pressure from their supporters when they officially released a new team badge, which brought Shenhua back into the team logo and subsequently changed the club&#x27;s name to &quot;Shanghai Greenland Shenhua Football Club&quot;.

On 3 February 2015, three days after the Australian national football team won the AFC Asian Cup, Tim Cahill announced he had been signed by the Shenhua, moving from the New York Red Bulls Despite signing a one-year contract extension in November 2015, Tim Cahill announced on his Instagram on 16 February 2016, that his contract had been terminated by incoming coach Gregorio Manzano. No reason was given for his termination beyond saying that he was &quot;not part of the new coach Manzano&#x27;s plans for the 2016 season...&quot;

Shanghai Shenhua won the 2019 Chinese FA Cup, beating Shandong Luneng Taishan 3–0 at a packed Hongkou Stadium on 6 Dec 2019, making it a 3–1 aggregate victory for the Blues. It was the fifth time Shenhua had lifted the trophy, and the second time in three years, after their 2017 Chinese FA Cup victory over city rival Shanghai SIPG.

In 2021, the CFA launched its &quot;neutral name campaign&quot;, requiring professional clubs to switch to names that do not mention their sponsors. The club, though, always had been publicly recognized as &quot;Shenhua&quot;, had different sponsor prefixes and suffixes (such as &quot;Greenland Shenhua&quot; and &quot;Shenhua SVA&quot;) in the last thirty years. Responding to the call for neutral names, the club owner, Greenland, restored the name of the club to &quot;Shanghai Shenhua F.C.&quot; without prefixes or suffixes on February 9, 2021.

On 23 November 2022, the club was deducted six points for unpaid salaries. The club would admit that they had been in financial difficulties for over a year and it was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they have resolved the issue and were looking for additional financial investment. 

=== Jiushi Era ===
On 6 January 2023, the club declared that the Shanghai Jiushi Group would become the owners of the club.

==Rivalries==

Shenhua&#x27;s fiercest and oldest rivalry is against Beijing Guoan, and the rivalry is often referred to as the China Derby. The rivalry with Beijing is viewed as a manifestation of the rivalry that exists between the two most important cities in the country, as one is the center of government while the other is the financial centre of modern commerce within China. Each club had an extensive history, including successful periods. However, they rarely competed directly for trophies until the 1997 league season. With Shenhua having won the 1995 league title and Beijing having won the 1996 Chinese FA Cup, both teams looked as if they had the pedigree to win trophies that season and on 20 July 1997, in a vital league game, Beijing thrashed Shenhua 9–1 at the Workers Stadium in Beijing. It would be Beijing&#x27;s largest victory and Shenhua&#x27;s greatest defeat ever recorded. Soon after that event, both teams would meet again in the 1997 FA Cup final, which saw Beijing win the cup.

When professionalism was established in 1994 within the Chinese leagues, it opened the door for more than one team within each city. This eventually paved the way for the first-ever Chinese top-flight city derby, which took place in 2002 when Shanghai Shenhua lost 2–0 to Shanghai Zhongyuan (later renamed Inter) in front of a sold out Hongkou Football Stadium. Known as the Shanghai derby, it would be the start of an intense but short rivalry between the two clubs, which reached its peak on the final day of the 2003 league season with both teams within reach of winning the league title. Shenhua won their game while Inter surprisingly lost theirs to relegation fighting club Tianjin Kangshifu. This saw critics dispute the title win and it was eventually discovered that both teams had players and officials match-fix games throughout the campaign. Shenhua would retrospectively lose their title while the Inter owners decided it was financially unviable to remain in Shanghai and relocated their team to Xi&#x27;an, which effectively ended the rivalry.

With Inter Shanghai leaving the city, Shenhua experienced another one of these Shanghai derbies when Shanghai United was promoted in the 2006 league season. The rivalry between the two teams never reached the same intensity as what was experienced against Inter because United had only recently relocated to the city and was building their fan base. Any development of a rivalry was ultimately cut short when Zhu Jun took over both teams and merged them together, with Shenhua keeping their name. In 2012, Shanghai Shenxin moved to the city, revitalizing the derby. However, it was the promotion of Shanghai SIPG in 2013 that caught the fans&#x27; imagination because they were formed by Xu Genbao, who had previously managed Shenhua. The club&#x27;s geographical location has also opened them up to rivalries with neighbouring clubs Hangzhou Greentown and Jiangsu Suning, where they contest in a fixture called the Yangtze Delta Derby.

Later, with the relegation of Shanghai Shenxin in 2015 and then disbandment in 2020, Shanghai SIPG became the sole rival for Shenhua in Shanghai. The competition reached its peak when Shenhua beat SIPG in the 2017 Chinese FA Cup finals on aggregate and when SIPG won the super league soon after, in 2018. The rivalry between the fans and the players made the new Shanghai derby arguably the most exciting derby in China. Also, in 2020, with Jiangsu Suning lifting the domestic league, Jiangsu fans escalated the cross-town rivalry by renting a billboard showcasing Jiangsu&#x27;s trophy just outside the Hongkou Stadium, Shenhua&#x27;s home venue. This act of provocation incited massive rebuke from the Shenhua fans, resulting in the ad being removed the day after. However, though fierce the rivalry might have been through the years, it concluded with Jiangsu Suning&#x27;s dissolution in 2021.

<text>Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton (10 February 172325 October 1769), was a Scottish peer.

Eglinton was the son of The 9th Earl of Eglinton. His mother, who was the third wife of the 9th Earl, was Susanna, Countess of Eglinton, the society beauty. He was the Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland from 1750 to 1751.

Lord Eglinton was one of the first of the Scottish landowners to carry out improvements on his estates. He planned and built the conservation village of Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, in 1769 around the basic plan of a capital &#x27;A&#x27;. The Earl introduced the young James Boswell to the joys of London society in the early 1760s, and figures prominently in &quot;Boswells London Journal, 1762-63&quot;.

The Earl was shot on the beach near his own estate of Ardrossan by an excise officer or &quot;Gaudger&quot; (Scots) named Mungo Campbell on 24 October 1769 following a dispute about the latter&#x27;s right to bear arms on the Earl&#x27;s grounds. The Earl died from his abdominal wounds late that evening. Campbell was convicted of murder but died by his own hand before the sentence could be carried out.

<text>Fort Siloso is a decommissioned coastal artillery battery in Sentosa, Singapore. It consists of 12 such batteries which made up &quot;Fortress Singapore&quot; at the start of World War II, and saw action during the Battle of Singapore. The fort is now a military museum open to the public. The Surrender Chambers in Fort Siloso reopened in June 2017 with a refreshed exhibition and free admission.

==History==
===Construction===

The word &quot;Siloso&quot; of the fort&#x27;s name is derived from a Malayan word meaning &quot;rock&quot;. There was a huge rock at the mouth of Singapore&#x27;s harbour which imposed a hazard to passing shipping. With trade ever flourishing in Singapore since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, it became necessary to protect Singapore&#x27;s port. Based on the report by Major Edward Lake of the British Royal Engineers, a fort was decided to be built on Pulau Blakang Mati (Sentosa) in 1874 to protect Keppel Harbour. As part of the planned fortifications, Mount Siloso&#x27;s top was blown off to flatten it for the installation of coastal-artillery gun platforms. By the 1880s, several gun batteries were located on Mount Siloso and Mount Serapong (facing north towards mainland Singapore on Sentosa&#x27;s northern coast) on Pulau Blakang Mati, becoming a stronghold of British naval defences in Singapore. Fort Siloso was built in 1878.

By the 1880s, Fort Siloso possessed 7-inch guns and two 64-pounder guns. In the 1890s, five 10-inch guns were also installed. These guns were operated automatically and powered from an underground electric-powerhouse. In the 1930s, twin 6-pounder guns, Quick-Firing anti-torpedo-boat guns, five large searchlights, an Operational Tower (for overall command and control), two machine-gun nests and two twin-Lewis anti-aircraft machine guns were added due to reports of an impending war (rising from an ever military-ambitious Imperial Japan). The fort was manned by both the British Royal Artillery and the locally formed Singapore Artillery Corps.


===World War II===
The forts were designed and built to defend Singapore against an invasion by sea from the south. However, during the Battle of Singapore in February 1942, the guns were instead turned 180 degrees inland to fire at rapidly-advancing Japanese forces approaching Singapore from the north (via British Malaya). The fort&#x27;s guns were fired at encroaching Japanese positions and troops who were pushing towards the city-area northwest from Tengah Airfield. The British and local troops who were retreating from the overrun Pasir Laba Battery (in Singapore&#x27;s northwest) and heading back to friendly British lines via the sea were mistaken for Japanese troops and fired upon, with at least major casualties sustained.

The building at the entrance of Fort Siloso is now known as the Surrender Chambers and has a vivid portrayal of the scenes of the British and Japanese surrenders in WWII with actual footage of the war being played interactively. This is on the upper storey, with the ground floor having been turned into a souvenir shop. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore from 1942 to 1945, the fort was used as a small prisoner-of-war camp.

===Post-World War II===
After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Royal Navy occupied the fort in 1946 and its guns were manned by the 1st Malay Coast Battery and Royal Artillery. Gurkha detachments from British India took over manning the guns when the British gunners were withdrawn and the 1st Malay Coast Battery was disbanded sometime later in 1946. During the Konfrontasi period between Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia and the Malaysian Federation from 1963 to 1965, Fort Siloso was manned by the 10th Gurkha Rifles to prevent Indonesian military-trained saboteurs from landing on Sentosa and Keppel Harbour slightly inland.

Fort Siloso became a Catholic retreat for locally based British forces until Sentosa was handed over to the Singapore government following the British military withdrawal starting in 1967. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) then took control over the fort.

Fort Siloso was then converted into a military museum in 1974, displaying its history and various naval guns. Other coastal guns (both British and Japanese) from different parts of Singapore, such as a pair of Japanese naval cannons discovered and brought over from Mandai, were put here for display. It had previously held the display of the British surrender of Singapore in February 1942 until its relocation to the Former Ford Factory (the actual site of the British surrender) in Bukit Timah in February 2006.

Plans for the gazetting of Fort Siloso into a national monument began in June 2016 as it is also a wartime museum, and also a military museum dedicated to Republic of Singapore Navy. Fort Siloso was gazetted on 15 February 2022.

<text>Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim (also known as the Rabbinical Seminary of America) is an Orthodox yeshiva based in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, New York, United States. It is primarily an American, non-chasidic Haredi Talmudic yeshiva. The yeshiva is legally titled Rabbinical Seminary of America (RSA) but is often referred to as just Chofetz Chaim as that was the nickname of its namesake, Yisroel Meir Kagan. It has affiliate branches in Israel and North America.

==History==
===Brooklyn===
The Yeshiva was established in 1933 by Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz, a great-nephew of the Chofetz Chaim. Leibowitz was a disciple of Nosson Tzvi Finkel and he also studied under Naftoli Trop at the Yeshiva in Radun, Belarus.

The yeshiva was named for Leibowitz&#x27;s great uncle, Rabbi Yisroel Meir Kagan, who had died that year. It is officially named Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen, but is often referred to simply as Chofetz Chaim (), which is commonly used as a name for Kagan, after his book with the same title. &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot; means &quot;desires life&quot; in Hebrew.

The Yeshiva&#x27;s first building was in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

===Queens===
In December 1955 it relocated to Forest Hills, Queens. Most recently, in the summer of 2002, the Yeshiva relocated to Kew Gardens Hills, Queens.

===Leadership===
After Leibowitz died in December 1941, he was succeeded as head by his son, Henoch Leibowitz, a role held in the 21st century by Dovid Harris and Akiva Grunblatt.

The yeshiva houses a boys&#x27; secondary school or Mesivta, Yeshiva Preparatory High School, headed for many years by Rabbi Zechariah Fendel, an undergraduate yeshiva, and a rabbinical school that grants Semicha (ordination). Rabbinical students at the yeshiva often spend a decade or more there, studying a traditional yeshiva curriculum focusing on Talmud, &quot;mussar&quot; (&quot;ethics&quot;), and &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;Jewish law&quot;).

== Characteristics ==

The yeshiva is known for six primary characteristics that distinguish it from other schools:

#It places an emphasis on unpacking the latent processes of reasoning within the steps of the Talmudic &quot;sugya&quot; (section of text) being studied. It understands that the initial assumptions of the Talmud must have already been made after a highly rigorous process and therefore that the progression from that initial thought process (known as the hava aminah) to the final conclusion (known as the maskana) must be fully unfolded and understood.
#It emphasizes rigor in its approach to ethical and Biblical texts and commentaries with the idea that a deduction from these texts should ideally be &quot;logically and textually compelling.&quot;
#It places a strong emphasis on the study of Mussar (&quot;ethics&quot;), both by attending and reviewing bi-weekly lectures and through daily individual study. This emphasis began with Dovid Leibowitz, who founded the yeshiva based on the doctrine of his rebbe, the Alter of Slabodka, and Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, the founder of the Mussar movement. The head of the yeshiva, Henoch Leibowitz would continually remind his students that as important as it is to become a lamden (&quot;analytical scholar&quot;) and a great pedagogue, it is even more important to become a mentch (&quot;a good human being&quot;).
#It places a premium upon involvement in Jewish education and on the propagation of the ideals and values of Judaism amongst the greater Jewish population. Upon completion of a rigorous term of study, students are encouraged to seek employment, and they have built institutions, such as schools and synagogues, in communities like Orlando, Florida and Henderson, Nevada that are distant from the major Jewish communal centers in the United States. 
#The yeshiva is very committed to its students’ subordination to &quot;Daas Torah,&quot; as defined in the introduction to the six-volume collection of Henoch Lebowitz&#x27;s mussar lectures, &quot;Chidushei Halev.&quot; It subscribes to the belief that all things are in some way included within the Torah and perforce, one who has spent years dedicated to in-depth study of the Torah is able to appropriately apply its logic to all plausible situations.
# It has adopted a philosophy that views as external factors as being of far less significance to internal factors, i.e. an individual should actually work on internal growth rather than on appearances.

==Affiliates and branches by location==
The network of affiliated schools was selectively built over many decades by Henoch, including, in 1964, the first Israeli branch.

<text>Keppel Harbour (; ), also called the Keppel Channel and formerly New Harbour, is a stretch of water in Singapore between the mainland and the southern islands of Pulau Brani and Sentosa (formerly Pulau Blakang Mati). Its naturally sheltered and deep waters was to meet the requirements of British colonists attempting to establish a Far East maritime colony in that part of the world, thereby setting the stage for the eventual formation of Singapore as a successful independent state.

==Etymology and history==
Keppel Harbour, by association with the rocky outcrop known as Batu Berlayar (and &quot;Lot&#x27;s Wife&quot; in colonial times) has been speculated to be the site of Long Ya Men, one of two 14th-century settlements described by Chinese sojourner Wang Dayuan during his travels in Southeast Asia; it has not been systematically excavated to confirm this, however. In the modern period, the harbour was first noticed in August 1819 by William Farquhar, who reported his discovery of a &quot;new harbour&quot; inhabited by &quot;orang laut&quot; (&quot;sea people&quot;, the indigenous ethnic group made up of various tribes of seafarers in and around the straits of singapore) living in boats to Sir Stamford Raffles the following month.

In the 1830s, the Straits Settlements, consisting of Singapore, Malacca and Penang, was a pirates&#x27; haven. By 1832, Singapore had become the busy centre of government for the three areas. It was also at this time that Captain Henry Keppel came to Singapore and helped to clear the Straits of pirates. Whilst based at Singapore, he discovered the deep water anchorage that came to be called by his name. Keppel first sailed to Singapore as a midshipman in 1832 and took part in the Naning (Malacca) expedition, and came again later in 1842 to help with the suppression of piracy in the Malay Archipelago. Keppel had a long association with Singapore, having visited the island on several occasions up to 1903. He surveyed the new harbour of Singapore, which was formed based on his plans. The harbour was completed in 1886.

In 1855, Captain William Cloughton, William Paterson and William Wemyss Ker purchased Pantai Chermin from Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the Temenggong of Johor. In 1859, Cloughton built the first dry dock known as Number 1 Dock. In 1868, the second dock, Victoria Dock, was inaugurated by Sir Harry George Ord, Governor of the Straits Settlements. The Albert Dock was opened in 1879.
For a while, the harbour was simply known as New Harbour but it was renamed Keppel Harbour in honour of Admiral Keppel, who was instrumental in clearing the straits of pirates, by the Acting Governor, Sir James Alexander Swettenham, on 19 April 1900. 

New Harbour Road was also renamed Keppel Road. The Chinese names for Keppel Road and Keppel Harbour were &quot;sin kam kong chu u&quot; or &quot;Kampong Bahru dock&quot;, and &quot;sek lat moi&quot; or &quot;&quot;selat&quot; passage&quot; (&quot;selat&quot; is Malay for straits).

==Plans==
Singapore&#x27;s largest conglomerate, the Keppel Corporation, has announced plans to build exclusive villas on the 5.3 hectare Keppel Island that it owns in Keppel Bay at Keppel Harbour — home to a shipyard until 2000.
The group has launched a condominium designed by renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, who is designing the masterplan for New York&#x27;s ground zero site. The 1,200-unit waterfront condominium — known as &quot;Keppel Bay phase two&quot; — was launched in early 2007. It sits on about 84,000 square metres of land on the mainland opposite Keppel Island, with a shoreline of 750 metres. It has six high-rise blocks and spacious low-rise apartments.

The condominium is part of the Keppel Bay mega development, which is 70 per cent owned by Keppel Corp and 30 per cent by its unit Keppel Land. About 2,800 homes are set to be built, including the existing 969-unit &quot;Caribbean at Keppel Bay&quot;.

The most exclusive homes of the lot are reserved for Keppel Island, where the &quot;Marina@Keppel Bay&quot;, a separate development, was completed in late 2007. The marina will have high-end restaurants and tentative plans are for high-end villas and possible condominium units on the island.

A 250-metre Keppel Bay Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge links Keppel Island to the mainland.

Keppel also has two other smaller plots for condominium on the other side of the &quot;Caribbean&quot;. Corals condominium is located beside &quot;Caribbean&quot;, adjacent to the former site of King&#x27;s Dock (the second largest dock in the world at the time after its opening on 26 August 1913) with 366 units. One is 3.4 ha in size while the other, a joint venture with Mapletree, is 2.9 ha.

<doc id="1229781" wikidata="Q559952" url="?curid=1229781" title="Muhammad Khan Junejo">
<text>Mohammad Khan Junejo (18 August 1932 18 March 1993) was a Pakistani politician and statesman who served as the tenth Prime Minister of Pakistan from 1985 to 1988 under president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. During his tenure as prime minister he sought to strengthen the power of the office and assert civilian control over state affairs, foreign affairs and military appointments, coming into conflict with Zia-ul-Haq and various senior military officers eventually culminating in his dismissal by Zia. His inquiries into the Ojhri Camp Disaster, appointment of Aslam Beg as VCOAS, various Corps Commanders, growing control over senior military promotions, forays into international politics, rejecting Zia appointments in his cabinet, stance against martial law, austerity policies and purported spying on Zia through the civilianized Intelligence Bureau all contributed to the souring in their relation.

Junejo was an influential landowner and involved in the agricultural industry. He was educated in Karachi, where he attended the St. Patrick&#x27;s College, and was trained as an agriculturist at Agricultural Institute, Plumpton College in the United Kingdom. He gained public notice when he joined the Ayub administration and subsequently held cabinet portfolio of railways, health, communications and labour from 1963 to 1969.

After participating in the 1985 elections, he was chosen to form the government on Pakistan Muslim League&#x27;s platform, of which, he took over the party&#x27;s presidency. His government was noted for its support of conservatism, austerity measures that reduced the government budget deficit, and repealing of the emergency laws which allowed the freedom of press and media in the country. Despite strong resistance and fierce opposition from President Zia-ul-Haq, Junejo authorized his Foreign Minister Zain Noorani to sign and ratify the Geneva Accords in 1988. His relations with President Zia-ul-Haq further soured when he opened a parliamentary inquiry on the Ojhri Camp disaster in 1988. On 29 May 1988, Prime Minister Junejo was dismissed by President Zia over charges on incompetence and economic stagflation and immediately called for new general elections. After the general elections held in 1988, he led his own faction while holding ceremonial party&#x27;s presidency.

== Early life and education ==
Mohammad Khan Junejo belonged to a Sindhi Rajput Family. He was born in Mirpur Khas District, Sindh, British India on 18 August 1932. He hailed from an influential agriculturalist family in Sindh that had a traditional conservative mindset.

He was educated at the St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Karachi and later graduated from the St. Patrick&#x27;s College. He went to Hastings in England where he was trained as an agriculturist and earned a diploma to be certified in 1954.

Junejo was an agriculturist and a farmer who cultivated the famed &quot;Sindhri&quot; mangoes in his local village in Mirpur Khas. His father, Deen Mohammed Junejo a landowner in modern day Mirpurkhas District (Sindhri) is also notable for being the one to introduce South Indian variety of mango to his plantations, which over time developed into the &quot;Sindhri&quot; mango. Junejo was a conservative Muslim and a dominant figure in his village, who had his wife living in the village for her entire life, and kept her out of public sight even when he was elected as prime minister and eventually moved to Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat. Nothing or very little was known about his wife as he often traveled and visited other states with his elder daughter; he was married with five children. 

==Early Political career==

Upon returning from the United Kingdom in 1954, he joined the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and under Ayub Khan&#x27;s Basic Democracies system was elected as Chairman of Chairman of the Sanghar Local Board (or Mayor for Sanghar District) and worked as a party worker for the Muslim League until 1963. He participated in elections and was elected for West-Pakistan legislative assembly and soon he joined the Ayub administration and subsequently held cabinet department of Health, Communications and Labour until 1965. He again successfully participated in the presidential elections in 1965 and was elevated as the Minister of Railways under the Ayub administration which he served until 1969. 

From 1970 to 1977, he was unable to defend his constituency from Sanghar but became closer to religious leader Pir Pagara, of which he later became his political missionary and devoted disciple (&quot;murid&quot;) of the Pir. In 1977, he was named as a caretaker cabinet minister when General Zia-ul-Haq, the chief of army staff, took over the civilian government led by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. From 1977 to 1979, he served as the Railway minister but later resigned in 1979. 

==Prime Minister of Pakistan==
=== Election ===
In January 1985, President Zia-ul-Haq announced to hold nationwide general elections that would be based on non-partisanism– there have been political rumors that the U.S. President Ronald Reagan had a subsequent political role in such regards.

Junejo was successful in defending his constituency from the Sanghar District and was known to be a religiopolitical missionary of Pir Pagara who had been leading his own political faction in Sindh. President Zia considered three names for the appointment of the Prime Minister that included: Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, Liaquat Ali Jatoi and Junejo– all were from Sindh. 

Two days after the promulgation of the RCO (Revival of Constitution 1973 Order) on 2 March 1985, President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq held a meeting with the Martial Law Administrators (MLAs) to select a prime minister. According to amendments in the constitution the President was to nominate a prime minister from the newly elected National Assembly. The MLAs decided since that former deposed prime minister, Z. A. Bhutto was Sindhi, the new prime minister should also be from Sindh. The MLAs supported the candidacy of Elahi Bakhsh Soomro over Mohammad Khan Junejo (who was also shortlisted). However, after General Zia&#x27;s consultation with Pir Sahib Pagara led to the dropping of Soomro and Junejo being selected for the role. 

President Zia hand-picked and appointed Junejo as prime minister through an invitation to form the civilian government in accordance with the Revival of Constitution Order (RCO). His mindset reflected a conservatism and was a powerful feudalist whom President Zia considered him to be ineffective in leading towards the decision-making processes. and after securing votes in the Parliament through the Vote of Confidence (VoC), he met with President Zia and reportedly asking him about the ending of the martial law. According to General Khalid Mahmud Arif, Junejo neither expressed happiness or thanked Zia after news of his appointment as prime minister.

=== End of Martial Law ===
On 20 March at 8:00 PM, Zia welcomed Junejo in his office and told him he planned to nominate him as Prime Minister of Pakistan, Junejo rather than thank the President instead immediately questioned him &quot;When do you plan to remove Martial Law?&quot; Zia tried to convince the Prime Minister that Martial Law would now support the Prime Minister. Early in his premiership during an address as the National Assembly, Junejo stated that Martial Law and Democracy could not coexist. Zia did not appreciate these remarks and Gen Mujibur Rehman, Zia&#x27;s information secretary had them expunged from the PTV telecast.

On 30 December 1985 Martial Law was lifted after Junejo had managed to &quot;push&quot; Zia enough. 

=== Civilian Premiership ===
Following the lifting of martial law on his repeated instances Junejo announced his cabinet in which he rejected many of Zia&#x27;s cabinet appointments, only accepting Sahibzada Yaqub Khan as foreign minister and Mahbubul Haq as Minister for Planning and Development and later Finance Minister. Junejo also removed Lt. Gen. Mujibur Rehman from his position as Secretary of the Ministry of Information. Anwar Zahid, a civil servant posted by Zia as the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister was replaced by Junejo by Captain Usman Ali Isani, which whom he was more comfortable. He kept two ministerial departments of defence and interior. 

He also overrode Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s objections to on having the same military staff as the president (e.g. MS and Aide-de-Camps) on the basis that the previous deposed PM Z. A. Bhutto had this privilege. He also exercised his own judgement in the appointment of key officials including federal secretaries, ambassadors, chief secretaries and inspectors-general of police. Junejo demanded the right to join the president in the ceremonial state coach and to jointly take salute on the occasion of the 23rd-March parade, later winning the right to independently act as chief guest on the 14th August official ceremony.

Prime Minister Junejo&#x27;s social policies led to the political independence when he was appointed as the President of Pakistan Muslim League. His policy also included the freedom of the press despite the opposition he faced from President Zia in this issue. He gained popularity for his daring stance and disagreement with Zia over a number of issues.

On the economic front, he took the austerity measures and ultimately halted the Islamization of Economy process ran under the Zia regime, which put him at odds with President Zia. 

Junejo attended every session of parliament and remained accessible even after office hours in order to build ties with members of parliament who were elected on non-party basis and had their own personal power bases. In an order issued through the Pakistan Banking Council (PBC), no bank was authorized to sanction a loan to any political office-holder without first referring the matter to him.

The Prime Minister also had an interest in foreign relations, meeting with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, Rajiv Gandhi at the 1987 SAARC Summit in Kathmandu, and the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito the same year.

Junejo was in Skardu when he received word that element in Parliament were mustering support to defeat the vote schedule for the June 1985 budget. The Prime Minister then spent the next two days on the phone with members of the National Assembly identifying issues in proposed tax changes which were causing problems. He then requested the finance minister to remove the most unpopular ones before the vote. The finance minister than suggested austerity measures to offset losses in taxes. Proposing to make it mandatory for members of the cabinet and civil officers who were entitled official cars to use locally assembled 1000cc Suzuki&#x27;s. Junejo sought to implement these austerity measures in the 1987-88 Federal Budget.

When Junejo made the announcement in parliament in June 1987 he added generals to the austerity list, which received widespread media coverage and editorial praise. The budget was passed.

Junejo continued to speak publicly about reducing the perks and privileges of senior military officers, at one point threatening to remove their large staff cars and putting them in domestically produced Suzuki mini-cars. This evoked a response from (Retired) Lt. Gen. Ejaz Azim on the newspaper &quot;The Muslim&quot; on 28 June 1987, who according to Shuja Nawaz was encouraged by Zia to write an article that defended the senior leadership of the army.

When Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan, Zia maintained that her supporters would not be allowed to welcome her at the airport. At a meeting in Lahore chaired by Zia, Junejo said the government should under no circumstances stop the crowds. &quot;There is democracy in the country,&quot; Further remarking. &quot;We cannot prevent people from gathering to receive her.&quot; Junejo managed to prevail over the President.

In order to strengthen his own position Junejo sought to create a government party. Political parties could be officially registered from February 1986 onwards, but Junejo registered a new reconstituted Pakistan Muslim League (PML) a month early, linking his with the Pagaro Muslim League, becoming President of the new party, which was the only party legally allowed to hold the name &#x27;Muslim League.&#x27; Following the response accorded to Benazir Bhutto, convinced Junejo that the party would need populist support. Its eleven-resolution manifesto published on 2 July promised economic reforms for the rural and urban poor, even of Junejo lacked the political base to do so. He gained legislative support by allowing members of the National Assembly to disburse development funds and residential plots to their own constituents.

=== Political conflict with General Zia ===

In 1986–87, his political relations with President Zia began to deteriorate over the control of foreign policy. Against Zia&#x27;s wishes Junejo authorized his Foreign Minister Zain Noorani to ratify the Geneva Accords that allowed the Russian retreat from Afghanistan. In this regard, he had held a party conference where he invited the Communist Party and Pakistan People&#x27;s Party to discuss to end the bloodshed in Afghanistan. In 1987, he provided his political support and eventually used his prerogative to appoint Lieutenant-General Mirza Aslam Beg as vice-army chief, despite President Zia wanting Lieutenant-General Zahid Ali Akbar, who was instead sent to DESTO.

Junejo began to assert his authority in the appointments of senior army officers and approving promotions to three and four-star ranks. He would also withhold promotions until those he wished to promote were also promoted. An example being Lt. Gen. Shamim Alam Khan who later became Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), whose promotion on Junejo&#x27;s insistence only came after Zia&#x27;s choice Major General Pirdad Khan was also promoted. Junejo had sat on Pirdad Khan&#x27;s promotion until Zia agreed to Alam&#x27;s. Prior to his dismissal the latest appointments of corp commanders would also be approved by him. General M. Shariff was promoted to Lieutenant General and became commander of V Corps in Karachi in May 1988 by Junejo. To replace the outgoing VCOAS, Zia recommended Lt. General Zahid Ali Akbar Khan, however Junejo turned down the recommendation and instead promoted Mirza Aslam Beg to the position.

Prime Minister Junejo also stalled the fundamentalist legislation in an attempt to keep leverage on President Zia. Following the massive explosion near the hidden Ojhri camp facility in Rawalpindi Cantonment that resulted in more than 100 lives lost, Prime Minister Junejo announced to call for a parliamentary inquiry to overlook the incident. After ordering an initial inquiry under Gen Imran Ullah Khan he changed his stance over fears of cover up and constituted another committee under Aslam Khattak, Qazi Abdul Majeed Abid, Ibrahim Baloch and Rana Naeem. Junejo informed the media that he would present the committee&#x27;s report to the National Assembly and punish those responsible. According to Salman Faruqui, this was the &quot;final nail in the coffin&quot; for the Zia-Junejo relationship. Yusuf Zaman called it the &quot;final straw which broke the camel’s back.&quot; According to Ian Talbot, the investigation threatened to embarrass the ISI, General Arif also claimed that Zia&#x27;s desire to exonerate former ISI director, General Akhtar Abdur Rahman would play a factor in the later dismissal of Junejo under Article 58(2)(b).

In 1986 he re-asserted civilian control over the Intelligence Bureau (IB), replacing a serving major general, Agha Nek Mohammad with police officer Mian Aslam Hayat. Zia was told that the Prime Minister had ordered surveillance of him, which was to be conducted by the Civilian Intelligence Bureau (IB). According to General Arif, the President ordered the head of Signal Corps to confiscate all the recording equipment of the IB following the dismissal of Junejo. This equipment would later be released without screening. General Refaqat, the Presidents new COS was also blamed in the souring of relations between Zia ul Haq and Mohammad Junejo.

On 28 May 1988, DG ISPR Brigadier Siddique Salik informed Prime Minister Junejo of President Zia holding the press conference the next day in this regard, terming it &quot;very important.&quot; On 29 May 1988, President Zia appeared on PTV News and surprisingly announced to have dissolved the Parliament, using the Eighth Amendment. Many investigative newspapers and political gossips pointed that it was the inquiry report on the &quot;Ojhri Camp disaster&quot; that implicated the military members in Zia&#x27;s administration despite President Zia claiming of Junejo&#x27;s Government had been dismissed because the law-and-order situation had broken down to an alarming extent and the government could not be run in accordance with the Constitution.

== Later Political Career ==
During the general elections held in 1988 his Junejo Muslim League joined the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad alliance. He was unsuccessful for defending his constituency but was elected for the National Assembly general elections held in 1990 and remained head of the Pakistan Muslim League (J). During the run up to the 1990 elections, the ISI reportedly provided financing to the opponents of the Pakistan Peoples Party. Following a case registered by (Retired) Air Marshal Asghar Khan against Gen Aslam Beg, DG-ISI Asad Durrani and Yunus Habib, Durrani produced an affidavit listing those who had received money from the ISI. A report from Ardeshir Cowasjee, a newspaper columnist, based on the affidavit included Junejo, who reportedly received Rs. 2.5 million from the ISI. 

After sacking Junejo, Zia attempted to have Junejo removed as President of PML. Despite Zia&#x27;s support to candidates such as Nawaz Sharif he failed to remove Junejo. Following the death of Junejo, Nawaz Sharif nominated himself as President of the Pakistan Muslim League on 21 March 1993.

== Later life and death ==
In 1993, he was diagnosed with leukemia and went to the United States for the treatment where he was treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, where he died the same year. He was brought and buried in his locality.

His widow, Begum Junejo, died in Karachi on 13 July 2003, at the age of 60.

Former Federal Secretary and Press Secretary to Junejo Syed Anwar Mahmood, writing an editorial in &quot;The News International&quot; called Junejo &quot;honest to the marrow,&quot; who led &quot;by example&quot; and claimed he &quot;never compromised&quot; on integrity and merit. Further remarking he could not recall a democratically elected government in Pakistan governing so &quot;fairly, cleanly and effectively,&quot; writing that its dismissal by Zia Ul Haq &quot;derailed the democratic train so badly that it continues to wobble even today.&quot;

Journalist Shaikh Aziz called Junejo a &quot;calm person&quot; who never showed &quot;high ambitions&quot;, when he was in communications with Ayub Khan. But after questioning Zia over the lifting of Martial Law he thought of becoming a &quot;real prime minister&quot;. Also calling him a &quot;thorough gentleman&quot; and &quot;true disciplinarian&quot;, who &quot;possessed a reputation of unquestionable integrity.&quot;

According to Ishtiaq Ahmed, &quot;Instead of being the pliant protégé, Junejo turned out to be a man of principles and integrity—which Zia found unacceptable.&quot;

Salman Faruqui, a former civil servant writing in &quot;Dawn&quot; claimed due to his farming background, Junejo was often able to foresee rough weather and gathering storms and would move accordingly. Further asserting &quot;He had demonstrated leadership to a brutalised nation and given it some hope.&quot; Who conducted himself with &quot;integrity and dignity, caring for the poor and downtrodden.&quot;

Ian Talbot in &quot;Pakistan: A Modern History&quot; stated that &quot;Even on apparently trivial matters of protocol, Junejo sought to do everything possible to raise the dignity of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office.&quot;

His public image was popular in politics for his driving of blue coloured Suzuki FX and, he popularly drove the FX in Islamabad despite the annoyance of President Zia who had a strong preference for Mercedes-Benz W126.

<doc id="1229795" wikidata="Q2039548" url="?curid=1229795" title="Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi">
<text>Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi (; ) (14 August 1931 – 20 November 2009) was a Pakistani politician who served as the Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan for three months, from 6 August 1990 to 6 November 1990.

==Early life==
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi was born in New Jatoi, Naushehro Feroze District, Sindh. He was the eldest of four brothers, and his grandfather, Khan Bahadur Imam Bux Khan Jatoi, was a member of the Bombay Legislative Assembly in 1923, 1927 and 1931. At the time there were only four members representing the entire present Province of Sindh.

His father Ghulam Rasool Jatoi was a member of the Sindh Legislative Assembly twice in 1946 and again 1952, after which one unit was imposed in West Pakistan.

Jatoi was educated at Karachi Grammar School and passed his senior Cambridge. In 1952, he went to England for his bar at law, but had to return home within one year due to his father&#x27;s serious illness.

Mr Jatoi was an active leader in politics. He was one of the founding members of Pakistan Peoples Party along with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was one of Bhutto&#x27;s closest confidants until Bhutto&#x27;s execution in 1979. He remained associated with the PPP until 1986 when he formed his own party with its emblem of a tractor, becoming one of Pakistan&#x27;s political leaders with his own political party.

==Politics==
Jatoi was elected to the first Provincial Assembly of West Pakistan in 1956. He has also served as chairman District Board of Nawabshah District in 1952, holding the distinction of being the youngest District Board chairman on the South Asia.

Jatoi along with Z.A. Bhutto and other politicians formed Pakistan People&#x27;s Party in 1967. 
He has been elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1962, 1965, 1970, 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1997. He has also been elected to the Sindh Provincial Assembly in 1973 and 1977.

He held the Portfolios of Political Affairs, Ports and Shipping, Communications, Petroleum and Natural Resources, Information Technology, Railways &amp; Telecommunications in the Federal Government headed by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1973, he was elected Chief Minister of Sindh, and held this office until 1977. He has the distinction of being the longest serving Chief Minister of Sindh since the birth of Pakistan. After the imposition of Martial Law, Jatoi remained associated with the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD). Twice he was arrested in 1983 and 1985.

Later, he founded the National Peoples Party. A number of political heavyweights from all over the country were brought into the National People&#x27;s Party, launched under the chairmanship of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi. Among them were Ghulam Mustafa Khar, Haneef Ramay, Hamid Raza Gilani and Kamal Azfar. An attractive manifesto was prepared and the party was expected to gain prominence due to the declining popularity of the Peoples Party at the time.

The NPP and the PML, then headed by Muhammad Khan Junejo, along with seven other political parties, contested the 1988 elections from the platform of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad. The PPP won the bout, though with a thin majority.

==Interim Prime Minister==

He was the Founder President of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) formed in 1988. In 1989, he was elected to the National Assembly in by-elections from Kot Addu. Jatoi was subsequently elected leader of the combined opposition parties in the National Assembly in 1989.

Mr. Jatoi was appointed prime minister after the dismissal of the Benazir Bhutto government on corruption and incompetence charges by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. In protest at the autocratic tendencies of the Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister, Mr. Jatoi joined hands with the opposition led by Bhutto in launching a movement against the Sharif government, resulting in its dismissal in 1993.

The NPP contested the 1993 elections and later joined the Benazir Bhutto government as a coalition partner until the Governments dismissal in 1996 by the PPP President Farooq Leghari. In the 2002 general election, it was the dominant partner in a new group called the National Alliance which was chaired by him. The National Alliance won 16 seats in the national Assembly, 16 seats in the Sindh Assembly and three Senate seats.

==Family==
In the 2008 election his son Ghulam Murtaza Khan Jatoi won election in NA-211 Naushahro Feroze-I under the banner of the National Peoples Party, defeating the runner-up PPP candidate and holding the seat won in 2002 by Dr. Abdul Ghaffar Khan Jatoi under the National Alliance banner. His other son, Arif Mustafa Jatoi (Former Food and Agriculture Minister) won PS-19 and another son, Masroor Jatoi won PS-23, both Provincial Assembly Seats. The Youngest son is Senator Asif Mustafa Jatoi. This has set a record wherein four sons are simultaneously present in all three Legislative forums, i.e. Provincial Assembly, National Assembly and Senate.

==Death==
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi died in London on Friday November 2009 after a protracted illness at the age of 78.

<text>Politics in Abkhazia is dominated by its conflict with Georgia. Abkhazia became &quot;de facto&quot; independent from Georgia after the 1992–1993 war, but its &quot;de jure&quot; independence has only been recognised by a few other countries. Abkhazia is a presidential representative democratic republic with a multi-party system, wherein the President is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government of the Republic of Abkhazia. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the People&#x27;s Assembly of Abkhazia.

Georgia maintains an Abkhazian government in exile in Tbilisi.

==Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia==

The &quot;de jure&quot; Government of Abkhazia in exile, then the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, left Abkhazia after the Russian-backed Abkhaz separatist forces and their allies from the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus took control of the region&#x27;s capital Sukhumi after heavy fighting on 27 September 1993, leading to the mass killings of ethnic Georgians and loyal citizens, in which several members of the Abkhazian government, including its chairman Zhiuli Shartava, were executed by the rebels. The Council of Ministers relocated to Georgia&#x27;s capital Tbilisi, where it operated as a de jure government of Abkhazia for almost 13 years. During this period, the GAIE was led by Tamaz Nadareishvili, until President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili appointed a new chairman, Irakli Alasania, his envoy in the peace talks over Abkhazia.

On 27 July 2006, the Georgian authorities relocated the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia to Upper Abkhazia. &quot;This decision means that for the first time since 1993 the government enters into the middle of Abkhazia, of our Abkhazia, to exercise Georgian jurisdiction and the Georgian constitutional order. This is very important fact and very fundamental political event,&quot; Saakashvili said in his televised address to the nation.

Malkhaz Akishbaia, a western-educated Abkhaz politician was Chairman of the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia from April 2006 to June 2009, when he was succeeded by Giorgi Baramia.

This Government was forced out of Upper Abkhazia during the 2008 South Ossetia War.

===Council of Ministers of Abkhazia in exile===

Ethnic Abkhaz and Georgian deputies elected to the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet under the unsuccessful 1991 power-sharing arrangement continue to operate from Tbilisi as the de jure government and parliament-in-exile. They began boycotting the Abkhaz parliament in May 1992, complaining of Abkhaz discrimination, and in June commenced a campaign of civil disobedience while attempting to set up parallel power structures in Sukhumi. In October 1992 elections to the Georgian parliament were conducted in those parts of Abkhazia controlled by the central Government. However, with Abkhazia outside Tbilisi&#x27;s jurisdiction by the time of the 1995 Georgian parliamentary election, the MPs elected from Abkhazia in 1992 automatically retained their seats in the Georgian parliament. After the separatist victory, the de jure Government represented 300,000 IDPs in Tbilisi. There were two significant political groups of Abkhaz IDPs. In April 1999 Tamaz Nadareishvili, chairman of the government-in-exile and at the outbreak of the war Deputy Chairman of the parliament of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic, founded the Abkhazia Liberation Party (ALP) to contest the October 1999 Georgian parliamentary elections. Formerly a Communist Party functionary in Abkhazia, he was Deputy Prime Minister of Georgia 1993–95. The ALP was the successor to My Home Abkhazia, a party he founded to contest the 1995 parliamentary election but which failed to gain parliamentary representation. However, the ALP is opposed by the Co-ordinating Council of Refugees from Abkhazia founded in 1996 by Boris Kakubava, an MP in the Abkhazeti faction. The Council was represented by the League of Popular Representatives of Georgia political party. Kakubava strongly opposed Shevardnadze whom he blamed for the loss of Abkhazia.

==Abkhazia today==
The Abkhaz conflict has not been resolved; a ceasefire agreement was signed on 15 May 1994 and a United Nations peacekeeping force (UNOMIG) was given the task of monitoring the agreement. A separate force from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was assigned to a peacekeeping mission.

Peace talks have taken place on and off over the last ten years, but have achieved little of significance. Although there have been no major outbreaks of fighting in the meantime, border clashes and armed raids by both sides continue to inflict casualties.

A new constitution was adopted, on 4 November 1994, which declared Abkhaz sovereignty. Parliamentary elections were held on 23 November 1996, but these were not recognised by the Georgian government or the international community, as the elections were held after ethnic cleansing when majority of pre-war population had fled Abkhazia. The CIS imposed economic sanctions in January 1996 and the region is officially blockaded by Georgia.

The &quot;de facto&quot; authorities organised a referendum on 3 October 1999 which approved the current constitution though more than half of the pre-war population expelled from Abkhazia did not take part in voting.

===2004 elections===
On 3 October 2004 presidential elections were held in Abkhazia. In the elections, Russia supported Raul Khajimba, the prime-minister backed by seriously ailing outgoing separatist President Vladislav Ardzinba. Posters of Russia&#x27;s President Vladimir Putin together with Khajimba, who like Putin had worked as a KGB official, were everywhere in Sukhumi. Deputies of Russia&#x27;s parliament and Russian singers, led by Joseph Kobzon, both a deputy and a popular songster, came to Abkhazia campaigning for Khajimba.

Still, on 12 October Abkhazia&#x27;s Supreme Court, after a series of contradictory decisions by the Electoral Committee, recognised that the new president would be a businessman Sergei Bagapsh, accused by his rival&#x27;s supporters of being pro-Georgian, although Georgia does not recognise any separatist candidates or even the elections. Abkhazia&#x27;s outgoing President Ardzinba claimed the decision was illegal and made under pressure from supporters of Bagapsh. The decision was cancelled by the Supreme Court the night of the same day. When supporters of Raul Khajimba seized the building of the Supreme Court and destroyed the protocols from local electoral constituencies new elections were prescribed.

Soon the Supreme Court cancelled the later decision, and again named Bagapsh the new president. His supporters captured a local TV station, while Raul Khajimba&#x27;s supporters took control over the parliament&#x27;s building. Outgoing president Ardzinba replaced Raul Khajimba as a prime-minister with Nodar Khashba, who, before this appointment served in the Ministry for Extraordinary Situations.

On 5 December the presidential candidates Sergei Bagapsh and Raul Khadjimba agreed to hold new elections. In these elections they would run on a joint ticket, with Khadjimba as vice presidential candidate.

===Politics after the recognition===

After Russia recognised Abkhazian independence the Abkhazian president Sergei Bagapsh signed a series of controversial deals giving Russia control over the border with Georgia proper, the Abkhazian railway network and airport, the right to build long term military bases as well as rights to search for oil off its coast. He also called for the legalisation of the sale of real estate to non-citizens.

These policies were met with growing alarm by opposition parties and war veteran groups. Amid growing tension a meeting on 20 May 2009 of six political parties and war veteran movements held a press conference in Sukhumi to express their concern at the president&#x27;s imputed plans to &quot;hand over chunks of Abkhazia&#x27;s national heritage to foreign commercial structures for a long time period.&quot; They described relations with Russia as &quot;based on trust and mutual respect&quot; before adding that the Abkhaz leadership&#x27;s &quot;hasty and thoughtless decisions&quot; risked fuelling anti-Russian sentiment and domestic political tensions in the run-up to the presidential ballot. And they stressed, &quot;our state must retain control over our strategic infrastructure.&quot;

The Vice President Raul Khadjimba (once an ally of Russia against Sergey Bagapsh) resigned on 28 May 2009, saying he agreed with the criticism the opposition had made. Subsequently, a conference of opposition parties in July 2009 nominated Raul Khadjimba as their candidate in the Abkhazian presidential election, 2009 scheduled for December of the same year.

==Abkhazia&#x27;s future==
Abkhazian leaders have made alternating demands in recent years. At times, they have insisted on full independence, and at other times, they have requested associate membership in the Russian Federation. However, the Russian government has inconsistently responded to the latter proposal, fearing the negative effect of such an action on its relations with Georgia. On 28 November 2003, Russian MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky brought forth such a resolution in the State Duma, but saw it rejected. Nonetheless, most citizens of Abkhazia now possess Russian citizenship, and Abkhazians do not require a visa. In April 2023, Russia threatened to annex Abkhazia, a move which was resolutely opposed by de facto Abkhazian authorities.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, European Union and United Nations have continued to insist that Abkhazia must remain part of Georgia, and that at the very least, the many Georgian refugees who fled after the 1992–1993 war must be allowed to return, before any acceptable vote on independence can be held.

The Georgian government has continued to insist on Abkhazia&#x27;s reunification with Georgia, but has differed in its suggestions of means to achieve this, particularly under the government of former President Mikhail Saakashvili.

They have, at times, proposed two main peace deals. The first one would divide Georgia into seven autonomous entities, each with power over police and economic issues, but relinquishing power over defence and foreign affairs to the federal government. In a later proposal, it was suggested that Georgia and Abkhazia could form one federal Georgian republic, somewhat along the lines of Serbia and Montenegro.

The Georgian government has, at times, suggested that they may attempt to resolve the conflict by military means. After the 2004 removal of Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze from office after large public protests, Saakashvili suggested that Abkhazia and fellow separatist entity South Ossetia could be reintegrated in the same manner. However, over the following months, he distanced himself from this idea.

Saakashvili has also attempted to portray the Abkhaz dispute as being between Georgia and Russia, owing to the latter&#x27;s support of the separatists, with the separatist government being portrayed as little more than a Russian puppet. To this end, they have pushed for either the complete removal of, or major changes to the mandate of the Russian peacekeepers, and the removal of Russian military bases from Abkhaz territory. During 2003, they succeeded in achieving the latter demand, with Russia removing its bases, leaving only its peacekeeping force.

Both the Abkhaz de facto separatist government and separatist opposition parties (Amtsakhara) resolutely oppose reunification with Georgia under any circumstances.

<text>Sarah Lucas (born 1962) is an English artist. She is part of the generation of Young British Artists who emerged in 1988. Her works frequently employ visual puns and bawdy humour by incorporating photography, sculpture, collage and found objects.

==Life and work==

===Education===
Lucas was born in London, England in 1962. She left school at 16, returning to study art at The Working Men&#x27;s College (1982–83), London College of Printing (1983–84), and Goldsmiths College (1984–87), graduating with a degree in Fine Art in 1987.

===Work===
Lucas was included in the 1988 group exhibition &quot;Freeze&quot; along with contemporary artists including Angus Fairhurst, Damien Hirst, and Gary Hume. In 1990, Lucas co-organized the East Country Yard Show with Henry Bond, in which she also exhibited. Her first two solo exhibitions in 1992 were titled &quot;The Whole Joke&quot; and &quot;Penis Nailed to a Board&quot;. It was in the early 1990s when Lucas began using furniture as a substitute for the human body, usually with crude genital punning. Created for a show organised by fellow artist Georg Herold at Portikus, &quot;Au Naturel&quot; (1994) is an assemblage of objects—a mattress, a bucket, a pair of melons, oranges and a cucumber—that suggest male and female body parts. For six months in 1993, Lucas and fellow artist Tracey Emin rented a retail space in east London, &quot;The Shop&quot;, where they made artworks, ranging from printed mugs to T-shirts with slogans, and put them on sale. In works such as &quot;Bitch&quot; (table, T-shirt, melons, and vacuum-packed smoked fish, 1995), she merges tabloid culture with the economy of the ready-made. In earlier work, she had displayed enlarged pages from the &quot;Sunday Sport&quot; newspaper. Through her career, Lucas has continued to appropriate everyday materials (including, for example, freshly made fried eggs) to make works that use humour, visual puns and sexual metaphors of sex, death, Englishness and gender.

Sarah Lucas is also known for her &#x27;Artist as Subject&#x27; approach where she produced a series of self-portraits, such as &quot;Human Toilet Revisited&quot;, 1998, a colour photograph in which she sits on a toilet smoking a cigarette. In her solo exhibition &quot;The Fag Show&quot; at Sadie Coles in 2000, she used cigarettes as a material, as in &quot;Self-portrait with Cigarettes&quot; (2000). And in 2001, Sarah Lucas used Neon tubes for her artwork &#x27;New Religion&#x27; in which a transparent coffin has been lit up violet. It was later acquired by George Michael in 2004.

Lucas&#x27; 2006 sculpture of a life-size bronze horse and cart, &quot;Perceval&quot;, is situated in Cullum Street, London.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in 2011, Aida Edemariam said that &quot;Lucas was the wildest of the Young British Artists, partying hard and making art that was provocative and at times genuinely shocking.&quot; In 1996, she was the subject of a BBC documentary, &quot;Two Melons and a Stinking Fish&quot;.

===Exhibitions===
Lucas had her first solo exhibition in 1992 at City Racing, an artist run gallery in south London, and her first solo show in New York at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in 1995. One-person museum exhibitions at Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam, at Portikus in Frankfurt, at Museum Ludwig in Cologne and at Kunsthalle Zürich, Kunstverein am Hamburg and Tate Liverpool have accompanied exhibitions in less conventional spaces—an empty office building for &quot;The Law&quot; in 1997, a disused postal depot in Berlin for the exhibition &quot;Beautiness&quot; in 1999, and an installation at the Freud Museum called &quot;Beyond the Pleasure Principle&quot; in 2000.

Lucas&#x27;s work has been included in major surveys of new British art in the last decade including &quot;Brilliant!—New Art From London&quot; at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1995, &quot;Sensation&quot; (Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Royal Academy in 1997), and &quot;Intelligence—New British Art&quot;, 2000, at Tate Britain. In 2003, Sarah Lucas participated in the 50th International Biennale of Art in Venice, &quot;Outlook: Contemporary Art in Athens&quot;, and &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;, a three-person exhibition for Tate Britain with Angus Fairhurst and Damien Hirst in 2004. From October 2005 to January 2006, Tate Liverpool presented the first survey exhibition of Lucas&#x27;s work.

In 2012 Lucas curated &quot;Free&quot;, an exhibition at the Southbank Centre by the Koestler Trust. The annual exhibition displays art works by prisoners, detainees and ex-offenders. The theme was &#x27;50&#x27;, to acknowledge the 50th anniversary of Koestler Trust and Lucas was 50 years old at the time.

In 2013 the Whitechapel Gallery in East London hosted a retrospective of Lucas&#x27; work. Tabish Khan writing for Londonist said about the exhibition: “Though it&#x27;s the sexually charged art that dominates this exhibition, Lucas is at her most powerful when exercising restraint and subtlety”.

In 2015 Sarah Lucas represented Britain at the 56th Venice Biennale with &quot;I SCREAM DADDIO.&quot; She was interviewed by close friend Don Brown during the installation of the exhibition.

In September 2018, The New Museum presented the first American survey of Lucas&#x27; work in the exhibition &quot;Sarah Lucas: Au Naturel&quot;. Lucas has also created new sculptural works for the exhibition, including &quot;This Jaguar&#x27;s Going to Heaven&quot; (2018), a severed 2003 Jaguar X-Type—the car&#x27;s back half burned and its front half collaged with cigarettes—and &quot;VOX POP DORIS&quot; (2018), a pair of eleven-foot-tall thigh-high platform boots cast in concrete. The exhibition traveled to the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in June 2019.

The National Gallery of Australia&#x27;s 2021-22 &quot;Know My Name Exhibition Part Two&quot; features the work &quot;Installation of Project 1: Sarah Lucas,&quot; as well as her first self-portraits, &quot;Eating a Banana.&quot;

Numerous works by Lucas feature in the exhibition Big Women at the firstsite gallery in Colchester in the UK in Spring 2023. In September 2023 an exhibition of her work opened at the Tate Britain. Writing about the Tate Britain exhibition Tabish Khan, writing for Culture Whisper, described the show as “It’s a show that’s playful, sexually charged and at times extremely dark&quot;.

In 2024, the Kunsthalle Mannheim shows a solo-exhibition of her works, curated by Luisa Heese.

=== Feminist interpretation ===
Lucas frequently employs a critical humour in her work in order to question conventions and highlighting the absurdity of the everyday. One of Lucas&#x27; most famous works &quot;Two Fried Eggs and Kebab&quot;, parodies the traditional still life and evokes similarities between itself and feminist Judy Chicago&#x27;s infamous piece The Dinner Party&quot;.&quot; Feminist reviews often describe Lucas as attempting to add female artists into the canon of art history through her analytical work that predominantly discusses the female body and voyeurism.

Lucas frequently appropriates masculine constructions to confront and dissect their nature. Her pieces represent a fantastical world and playfully employs unrealistic ideals to unearth obscene paradoxes created by those very constructions. Specifically, she is concerned with the casual misogyny of everyday life and employs the conventions of middle class or &#x27;street&#x27; language to enact her concepts. Her appropriation of masculine symbols such as the phallic banana or &#x27;fried eggs&#x27; in conjunction with her fearless and dominating gaze, takes &#x27;female work&#x27; out of the feminine sphere and disrupts the patriarchal power dynamic of the gaze. Works such as &quot;The old in Out&quot; (1988) is a reference to Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917) and &quot;Two Fried Eggs and Kebab&quot; (1992) has been linked to Édouard Manet &#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot; (1863). While Lucas continues the artistic legacy of feminist artists such as Hannah Wilke, Cindy Sherman, and Rachel Whiteread, her visual language empties femininity of meaning and thus removes her from such a clear &#x27;feminist art&#x27; title.

Sexuality is not apparent in her works and a lack of association with morality leaves viewers at the free will of her humorous narratives. Lucas takes on the role as a source of reflecting sexism, but not overtly commenting on it. She has stated that, &quot;I am not trying to solve the problem. I&#x27;m exploring the moral dilemma by incorporating it&quot;. Her works are both literal and conceptual evidence of Lucas searching for meaning. Whether it is through recognizable forms or her own mythologized fantasies, her ideas constantly build and transform. She appears to never be satisfied with her outcome and scours every imaginable medium for an outlet that is fitting. To her, the artworks she makes “...carry on talking and thinking with other people&quot;. Lucas&#x27;s practice is then not compulsive ramblings or automatic depictions, but a conscious yearning for a personal sense of happiness.

===Personal life===
Sarah Lucas was born in 1962 to a milkman father and a part-time gardener and cleaner mother, who she says had &quot;absolutely no ambition.&quot; She grew up in an estate in Holloway, north London, though she frequently accompanied her parents to other homes to &quot;ogle the furniture.&quot; She became pregnant at 17 after leaving school at 16 and had an abortion, then deciding to hitchhike around Europe in search of a direction for her life.

Lucas now lives with her partner Julian Simmons, in the former residence of Benjamin Britten near Aldeburgh; a home which is &quot;tucked away down a long country lane, behind a Baptist church in Suffolk.&quot; In August 2014, Lucas was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

=== Young British Artists ===
Young British Artists (YBAs) also known as the Brit artists or the Britart, are a group of British artists who in 1988 began to exhibit together. The group was organized by Damien Hirst and includes Angus Fairhurst, Michael Landy, Christine Borland, Tracey Emin, Cornelia Parker, and Gary Hume. The group became famous for their openness to materials and processes, shock tactics and entrepreneurial attitude. Their first exhibition &quot;Freeze&quot; included the work of Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Angus Fairhurst, and Michael Landy while they were all still students at Goldsmiths College of Art. The term &quot;Young British Artists&quot; was coined in May 1992 by Michael Corris in &quot;Artforum.&quot; The acronym YBA wasn&#x27;t created until 1996 when it was published in &quot;Art Monthly&quot; magazine. The terms became the brand for the group and showcased the &quot;can do&quot; spirit their art entailed.

<doc id="1229824" wikidata="Q6553529" url="?curid=1229824" title="Los Fronterizos">
<text>Los Fronterizos is an Argentine musical band consisting of four men. The group was established in 1953 in the northern province of Salta -- bordering on Bolivia -- from which &quot;Los Fronterizos&quot; (&quot;men of the frontier&quot;) is derived.

Los Fronterizos are among the most famous Argentine musical bands. They recorded over thirty records during the fifty years in which they were active. Their genre is &quot;Folklore Argentino&quot; (&quot;Argentine Folk&quot;) which blends powerful, vibrant rhythms from the Spanish Flamenco with indigenous South American elements such as the Andean flute, or &quot;quena&quot;. The latter is a hallmark of the &quot;Musica Andina&quot; genre which became well known in the U.S with Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s English version of &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;. Some of the Fronterizos&#x27; most famous records are &quot;Personalidad en Folklore&quot; (circa 1962), &quot;Color en Folklore&quot;, and Ariel Ramírez&#x27;s &quot;Misa Criolla&quot; (1964 and 1977). In most songs, the band&#x27;s instrumentation includes acoustic guitars and bombo legüero (a large indigenous drum), and occasionally, charango and quena.

Los Fronterizos&#x27; success may be attributed to their touching melodies written by some of Argentina&#x27;s best songwriters and to their remarkable harmony and rare combination of voices (one alto, two tenors, and one bass).

The group formally disbanded in 1977 but continued to reunite and perform in tours with great success for years thereafter. The very powerful lead voice (one of the two tenors) belonged to Gerardo López who died in 2004.

<text>Sawrey Gilpin (30 October 1733 – 8 March 1807) was an English animal painter, illustrator, and etcher who specialised in paintings of horses and dogs. He was made a Royal Academician.

==Life and work==
Gilpin was born in Carlisle in Cumbria, Kingdom of Great Britain. He was the seventh child of Captain John Bernard Gilpin, a soldier and amateur artist, and Matilda Langstaffe. He was the younger brother of the Rev. William Gilpin, a clergyman and schoolmaster who wrote of several influential works on picturesque scenery.

As a child Gilpin learnt to draw from his father, who ran a drawing school in Carlisle. Having shown an early predilection for art, he was sent to London at the age of fourteen to study under the marine painter Samuel Scott in Covent Garden. Gilpin, however, preferred sketching the passing market carts and horses, and it soon became evident that animals, especially horses, were his speciality. Gilpin left Scott in 1758, and devoted himself to animal painting from then on. Some of his sketches were shown to the Duke of Cumberland, who was much impressed by them, and employed Gilpin to draw from his stud at Newmarket and at Windsor, where he was ranger of the Great Park. He afforded the artist considerable material assistance in his profession.
==Animal painter==
Gilpin lived at Knightsbridge in London for some years. He became one of the best painters of horses that the country had produced, and was almost as successful in other areas of animal art. He sometimes attempted historical pictures on a larger scale in which horses were prominent, but with rather less success. He was purely an animal painter, and required the assistance of others to paint landscapes and figures; for the former he often turned to George Barret, Sr., to whom he gave similar service in return, and for the latter he sometimes used the services of John Zoffany, and Philip Reinagle.

Gilpin first exhibited with the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1762, and continued to show pictures there, mostly of horses, up to 1783. In 1768, and 1770-1, he exhibited a series of pictures illustrating &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s visit to the Houyhnhnms&quot;, one of which was engraved in mezzotint by Valentine Green; in 1770 a drawing of &quot;Darius gaining the Persian Empire by the neighing of his horse&quot;; in 1771 &quot;The Duke of Cumberland visiting his stud (with a view of Windsor Castle from the Great Park, by William Marlow)&quot;. In 1773 he became a director of the society, and in 1774 president.

He exhibited at the Royal Academy, London from 1786 until his death. He was elected an associate of the academy (ARA) in 1795, and Royal Academician (RA) in 1797. 
Gilpin married Elizabeth Broom; their son William Sawrey Gilpin (1762–1843) also became an artist, and in later life a landscape gardener. After his wife&#x27;s death Gilpin lived in Bedfordshire with his friend Samuel Whitbread. He then returned to London and spent his last years with his daughters at Brompton, where he died on 8 March 1807.

His pupils included John Warwick Smith and George Garrard. The latter married his eldest daughter Matilda.

==Works==
Many of his pictures of horses, dogs, and sporting scenes were engraved, notably &quot;The Death of the Fox&quot; (Royal Academy, 1788), engraved by John Scott (1774–1827); and &quot;Heron-Hawking&quot; (Society of Artists, 1780), engraved by Thomas Morris (fl. 1780-1800). He also made some etchings of horses and cattle, and made many illustrations for the works, both published and unpublished, of his brother William. His portrait is included in the series of drawings by George Dance (1741–1821), engraved by William Daniell, and now in the National Portrait Gallery.

There are works by Gilpin in the collections of the Courtauld Institute of Art, Tate Britain, and the Royal Academy, in London and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

<doc id="1229841" wikidata="Q1953777" url="?curid=1229841" title="Cowley, Oxfordshire">
<text>Cowley () is a residential and industrial area in Oxford, in the county of Oxfordshire, England. Cowley&#x27;s neighbours are Rose Hill and Blackbird Leys to the south, Headington to the north and the villages of Horspath and Garsington across fields to the east. Internationally, Cowley is best known for its automotive industry - historically it was the home of the car manufacturer Morris (later absorbed into British Leyland, then the Rover Group), which has now evolved into Mini.

==History==
The Cowley area has been inhabited since Roman times. The line of a Roman road runs north-south along the eastern edge of Cowley. It linked a Roman town at Dorchester-on-Thames with a Roman military camp at Alchester near Bicester. A road called Roman Way follows part of its route. It is behind the Mini car factory, starting opposite the Stagecoach in Oxfordshire bus garage. Cowley coalesced from the former villages of Middle Cowley, Temple Cowley and Church Cowley (around St James church), though the ancient parish of Cowley covered much of the area now known as East Oxford. The western portion of the original parish of Cowley was split off and became part of the city of Oxford in 1889, and was given the name of Cowley St John, though today it is often called the Cowley Road area, after the road across the fields from Oxford to Cowley villages.

The term Cowley today usually refers to the remainder of Cowley (the parish of Cowley St James where the original Cowley villages stood), which became part of the city of Oxford in 1928. However, because the settlements of Cowley were situated within the larger Cowley parishes, there are still some modern contexts (such as the Cowley Fathers mentioned below) when the term &quot;Cowley&quot; is used to refer to other areas in East Oxford outside of Cowley proper. Cowley was a manor from Medieval times, and a 16th-century manor house stood on Oxford Road near the corner with Hollow Way. In 1139, Matilda of Boulogne founded Temple Cowley here for the Knights Templar. The house became part of the Oxford Military College which was built on its grounds in the 19th century. In 1864, the Wycombe Railway between High Wycombe and Oxford was built through Cowley, but at this time the village was so small that the railway company did not provide it with a station.

Cowley St James C of E school, situated on Beauchamp Lane adjacent to the church, was established in 1834 and continued to operate as a primary school until 1975. Its most famous pupil was William Morris, later Lord Nuffield, who founded Morris Motors which was the source of a great deal of local employment leading to substantial growth in the area. A public house is named after him located in the nearby Templar Square shopping centre. Another well-known pupil of the school was the actress Dame Maggie Smith. In 1866 the Society of St. John the Evangelist, a Church of England religious order, was founded near Cowley Road in the parish of Cowley. SSJE was the first long-lasting Anglican religious order for men since the Reformation. The members were frequently known as the &quot;Cowley Fathers&quot;. In 1868 the Eddison and Nodding Company factory was founded in Cowley. John Allen bought it in 1897 and renamed it the Oxford Steam Plough Company. He later renamed it again as John Allen and Sons, and diversified into manufacturing other agricultural and horticultural machinery including the successful Allen Scythe powered by a small Villiers petrol engine. The works closed in the early 1980s, and the Templars Shopping Park formerly known as John Allen Centre retail park has since been built on the site.

The Oxford Military College bought the former Cowley Middle Class School in 1876. The College hall, a former manor house, was built in the early 17th century. The Chapel of 1870 was designed by the architect Edward George Bruton. An east wing designed by Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was added in 1877. The Oxford Military College closed in 1896, developed from 1912 by William Morris as the Cowley plant. During the 1960s, the centre of Cowley was demolished and replaced with Templas Square shopping center (previously it had been known as &quot;Cowley Centre&quot;, and sometimes still is). In the same decade the railway between Princes Risborough and Oxford closed, but the track between Kennington Junction and Cowley remains open for freight in and out of the car factory.

Between 1980 and 1992 the headquarters of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) was located in a converted barracks building at Cowley Barracks on James Wolfe Road, Cowley. The UKWMO was the organisation responsible for initiating the four-minute warning in the event of a nuclear attack on the UK and was disbanded at the end of the Cold War. Co-located with HQUKWMO was the Headquarters of No 3 Oxford Group Royal Observer Corps whose underground protected nuclear bunker at the Cowley site opened in 1965. Parts of the bunker were demolished in 1995, however most of it was refurbished including the air filtration systems. The site now belongs to Oxford Brookes University who built student accommodation on the site, and now use the former bunker as a storage facility making it the only student halls in the country with its own nuclear shelter.

In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 2790. On 1 April 1929 the parish was abolished and merged with St Giles and St John.

===Morris Motors===

The Cowley area was transformed after 1912 when William Morris bought the former Oxford Military College and moved Morris Motors Limited into it from its former premises in Oxford. He expanded into &quot;The Old Tin Shed&quot; in 1914 and then into a huge complex of purpose-built production lines in Cowley, as Morris pioneered Henry Ford-style mass production in the UK. The Great Western Railway, which had taken over the Wycombe Railway, opened a station called Morris Cowley to serve some of the thousands of workers commuting to the factory. In 1933, a goods yard was built beside the line to bring supplies into the factory and take completed vehicles away. This yard still exists and serves the current vehicle-manufacturing plant, though the railway beyond has long been lifted.

From the 1920s through to the 1960s, Cowley expanded into a huge industrial centre. In the Great Depression many people left areas of high unemployment such as South Wales and moved to the Cowley area to work in Cowley&#x27;s factories. Large areas of housing were built and rented out to the migrants. Florence Park was one area built in the 1920s for a private landlord to rent to new workers. The houses looked nice but they were poorly built and maintained, until the tenants held a rent strike and forced the landlord to make repairs. Most Florence Park houses are now owner-occupied, and the area&#x27;s tree-lined roads are now a popular neighbourhood in which to live. In World War II the Morris factory produced many de Havilland Tiger Moth training aeroplanes for the war effort and there was also the No 1 Metal and Produce Recovery Depot run by the Civilian Repair Organisation to handle crashed or damaged aircraft and even the wreckage of enemy aircraft was processed here. Paul Nash was inspired to paint &quot;Totes Meer&quot; based on sketches he made of the recovery depot.

Despite successive company mergers and name changes, &quot;Morris&#x27;s&quot; is still often used as the name of the car factory to this day. In 1952, Morris Motors became part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC), in 1968 BMC became British Leyland, in the 1980s the group was known as Austin Rover, in the 1990s it was Rover Group and since 2001 the factory has been owned by BMW. But the name &quot;Morris&#x27;s&quot; is ingrained in local culture and speech habits, particularly amongst older inhabitants. By the early 1970s, over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the vast Morris Motors and Pressed Steel Fisher plants. Unipart is also a major employer in Cowley, with premises next to the car factory. In later years Morris Motors and Pressed Steel became one company. Subsequently the Morris&#x27;s site was closed down, demolished, and redeveloped as the Oxford Business Park.

==Cowley today==
The car factory is known today as Plant Oxford and is now owned by BMW and has been extensively redeveloped. It remains the largest industrial employer in Oxfordshire employing more than 4,300 people. The plant was set up in 1926 by a consortium including William Morris and the Budd Company of America and was adjacent to the Morris Motors factory. Morris and the Budd Company both pulled out of the consortium and the plant became an independent supplier of bodies and tooling to Morris and other car manufacturers across the world. The company also produced the Prestcold refrigerators. When BMW sold the Rover Group they decide to retain the Pressed Steel Fisher site and transfer the Mini from Longbridge to Cowley, enabling the Longbridge site to continue to produce all the Rover products. BMW retained ownership of the Cowley plant, formerly Pressed Steel, to build the all-new Mini that was launched in the spring of 2001. It has been the best selling car to be built at the plant since the Maestro and Montego in the 1980s. The Morris Motors factory expanded with factory complexes on both sides of the Oxford Road. Although Morris started his original work on the outskirts of the city the Cowley site quickly became the production site for high volume production. 

It was the original base of Morris cars when the marque was founded in 1912, and production continued at the factory until 1982, with models including the Morris Minor, Morris Oxford, Riley Motor and Wolseley Motors cars. The Morris marque was not abandoned until 1984 when production of the Longbridge-built Morris Ital and development of the Morris Marina finished. The factory then became the production facility for the Maestro, Montego and the Princess Range. Production continued with the facility totally given over to production of the Rover 600 and Rover 800. These models were replaced by the Rover 75 in late 1998, but BMW broke up the Rover Group in 2000 and Rover 75 production moved to Longbridge. The original Morris Motor sites were flattened and a technology park has since been created on the site. The former Nuffield Press site including the former Oxford Military College buildings was redeveloped in the late 1990s into housing. The business park has attracted a large David Lloyd Leisure centre and offices of numerous companies including the European headquarters of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and the headquarters of international aid charity Oxfam GB. Cowley is an ethnically diverse community, with significant black and South Asian communities.

==Sports and leisure==

Cowley has a strong sporting tradition. In 1938 Oxford Stadium was built to host the sport of greyhound racing. In 1939 motorcycle speedway moved to Oxford Stadium. After a few years Oxford&#x27;s speedway team were named Oxford Cheetahs, a name they still bear today. Temple Cowley Pools in Temple Road was a public swimming and gymnasium complex run by Oxford City Council which closed in December 2014 for redevelopment as housing. Its main pool was 25 metres long. It was built on the site of part of a former Knights Templar estate. Opposite the site of the former pool is the band hall of the City of Oxford Silver Band and next door to it stands Cowley Library. Oxfordshire Record Office occupies the former St Luke&#x27;s church nearby. Morris Motors Athletic &amp; Social Club in nearby Crescent Road has a large sports ground and club house.

Until 2009 on Watlington Road, opposite the Mini factory, stood Johnson&#x27;s Café, which fed thousands of Morris Motors workers in the past. It was founded decades ago by Reginald Johnson and until its final day its interior was decorated with bold murals of early speedway stars. Reginald&#x27;s sons Aubrey and Len took over after the Second World War. Len&#x27;s son Joe Johnson was an international motocross star in the 1960s until he settled down to run the cafe alongside Aubrey and his son, Andrew, after Len&#x27;s death. After Aubrey&#x27;s death in the 1980s the cafe was run by Andrew and Joey to the end. This cafe suffered an armed robbery on 16 January 2008 and closed in 2009. The building is now occupied by Oxford Spin &amp; Fitness centre.

==Education==
Schools serving Cowley include Greyfriars Catholic School and Oxford Spires Academy.

==In popular culture==
Cowley is a principal setting in the novel &quot;The Alteration&quot; by Kingsley Amis, set in an alternative reality where the Protestant Reformation never occurred. Cowley was the site of the Holy Victory in the War of English Succession (where &#x27;Henry the Abominable&#x27; attempted to seize the throne from his nephew Stephen II, resulting in a papal crusade). As a result, it was renamed Coverley and made the ecclesiastical capital of England, surpassing the secular capital of London in terms of importance.

On his 1992 tour of England (heard on the posthumously released &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; album), the comedian and satirist Bill Hicks stated that he had found the &quot;Alabama of Britain&quot; whilst attending a radio interview in Cowley. 

Cowley is referenced in the lyrics of the song &quot;Zorbing&quot; by the British alternative indie folk band Stornoway: &quot;Been Zorbing through the streets of Cowley&quot;.

Young detective Endeavour Morse is based at Cowley Road police station in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; prequel &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

<text>In economics, a discount function is used in economic models to describe the weights placed on rewards received at different points in time. For example, if time is discrete and utility is time-separable, with the discount function having a negative first derivative and with (or in continuous time) defined as consumption at time , total utility from an infinite stream of consumption is given by:

formula_1

Total utility in the continuous-time case is given by:

formula_2

provided that this integral exists. 

Exponential discounting and hyperbolic discounting are the two most commonly used examples.

<text>Dhamar is one of the talas used in Hindustani classical music from the Indian subcontinent. It is associated with the dhrupad style and typically played on the pakhawaj and also tabla.

Dhamar taal has 14 beats (&quot;matra&quot;s) grouped asymmetrically into a 5-2-3-4 pattern.

A song in dhrupad style set to dhamar tala is also called a dhamar. The text of a dhamar concerns the antics of Krishna teasing the milkmaids during the &quot;Holi&quot; (&quot;hori&quot;) Spring Festival of colours. It is considered a relatively light, gentle, and romantic musical form.

The &quot;theka&quot; or syllabic pattern of dhamar tala is: 
In counting out the beat, beats 1, 6, and 11 are clapped (&quot;tali&quot;), and beat 8 is indicated by a wave of the hand (&quot;khali&quot;):

 (1) Clap 2 3 4 5 |(1) Clap 2 |(1) Wave 2 3 |(1) Clap 2 3 4 ||

<text>Joshua Richard Compston (1 June 1970 – 5 March 1996) was a London curator whose company Factual Nonsense was closely associated with the emergence of the Young British Artists (YBAs).

==Early life and career beginnings==
Compston was born in Putney. The son of a judge, he was educated at St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. Encouraged by his parents, Compston became an enthusiastic collector of antiques and ephemera. In his adolescence, he developed a friendship with Sir Peter Blake, and would bring him gifts of found ephemera.

Compston studied Art Foundation at Camberwell School of Art, followed by History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art. At Camberwell, Compston was the contemporary of Darren Coffield, who later became his biographer.

At the Courtauld he soon became frustrated that the academic lecturing staff were taking insufficient interest in the work of living artists, and that as a result students were ignorant of major figures in 20th century art. Traditionally, students at the Courtauld had been taught in rooms hung with the masterworks from the history of art borrowed from the affiliated Courtauld Gallery. Taking advantage of a relocation of the school to new premises in Somerset House, and newly empty walls in seminar rooms, he leveraged the Courtauld into exhibiting the work of contemporary painters on long-term temporary loan as &#x27;The East Wing Collection&#x27; - a practice which continues to this day as &#x27;The East Wing Biennial&#x27;. Past exhibitors in the Collection/Biennial include Mel Bochner, Damien Hirst, Howard Hodgkin, Michael Landy, Del LaGrace Volcano, Gilbert and George, Genesis P-Orridge and Martha Rosler. He graduated from the Courtauld in 1992. At this time, he was associated with the American gallerist Maureen Paley.

Joshua Compston first worked in commercial galleries when he became David Taborn’s agent, curating Taborn’s show at Gallery 202, Notting Hill Gate in 1989.

Joshua Compston&#x27;s initial exposure to pre YBA Shoreditch happened partly by accident, due to an infatuation with a daughter of writer Jocasta Innes and whose Spitalfields kitchen became a late night meeting point for Compston, Will Hodgkinson and many other creatives. This in turn led to renting a room at the next door house of Architect Sir Richard MacCormac.

==Factual Nonsense==
In 1993, he opened a gallery at 44a Charlotte Road, Shoreditch, the first gallery to open in what was then a slightly run-down part of east London. European Dadaist manifestos, 20th century propaganda and the Arts and Crafts Movement were influences in his creation of the Factual Nonsense brand and concept of social philosophy. The name of the gallery and art movement was taken from the title of a painting &#x27;Factual Nonsense&#x27; by David Taborn, whose work &#x27;A Guide For The Perplexed&#x27; was also used by Compston as the title for the gallery inaugural exhibition. 

As well as working with many of the artists of the YBA movement, including Gavin Turk, Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Angus Fairhurst and Damien Hirst, Compston&#x27;s main collaborator was the printer Thomas Shaw, with whom he created numerous Factual Nonsense posters, prints and other printed matter.

Compston organised events in Shoreditch as a part of his deliberate vision: to shape an artistic community and to create an urban regeneration, both of which became his legacy. The events included two summer fetes (&quot;A Fete Worse Than Death&quot;), and a picnic in Hoxton Square (&quot;The Hanging Picnic&quot;). Compston&#x27;s lasting legacy to Shoreditch was celebrated by a revival of &quot;A Fete Worse Than Death&quot; in 2014. His archive is held by the Tate Gallery.

==Death==
In 1996, at the age of 25, Compston died as the result of taking ether at his gallery in Charlotte Road, which was also his home. His coffin was painted with a William Morris pattern by Gary Hume and Gavin Turk. His funeral was attended by several hundred mourners including leading figures of the London art scene. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Compston&#x27;s tomb, on which he is depicted laid out on his little Thames boat, was carved from Portland stone by the artist and cartoonist Zebedee Helm.

<doc id="1229855" wikidata="Q1139747" url="?curid=1229855" title="Creston, British Columbia">
<text>Creston is a town in the Kootenay region of southeastern British Columbia, Canada.

==Time zones==
Settlements on the east shore of Kootenay Lake and along BC Highway 3 from Creston to Yahk are among the few areas of Canada that do not observe daylight saving time, remaining on Mountain Standard Time year-round. Forming a natural boundary, the lake and the Kootenay Pass on the Salmo–Creston highway divide the Pacific Time Zone from the mountain one. When daylight saving ends, the time change migrates from Yahk to the Kootenay Bay ferry landing. Consequently, Creston in the warmer months is on Castlegar time and in the colder months on Cranbrook time.

==Geography==
By road, Creston is roughly equidistant between Cranbrook (105 km (65 mi) to the east), Castlegar (124 km (77 mi) to the west) along the Crowsnest Highway, and Nelson (123 km (76 mi) to the north-northwest). Creston is approximately 12 km (7.5 mi) north of the Porthill-Rykerts Border Crossing on the Canada–US border. Defining Creston&#x27;s place as being within either the East or West Kootenays can be contentious, as some locals regard it as being in a transition space between them.

=== East Kootenay ===
The 1860 survey defined the Purcell Mountains as the east–west divide, which geographically places Creston in East Kootenay, but conversely the nearby community of Crawford Bay in West Kootenay. Prior to the opening of the highway over the Kootenay Pass from Salmo in 1963, allowing westward travel, Creston had tended to develop cultural links eastward via the only major highway of the time. Minor sports groups and teams, such as in hockey and baseball, belonged to East Kootenay leagues.

=== West Kootenay ===
An 1899 advertisement described the Creston Townsite Co. as West Kootenay Valley. Since the highest passes of the Purcells are north-northeast, Creston might be considered in the west of them.

=== Central Kootenay ===
The Creston Review, first published in 1908, took a neutral stance on which Kootenay descriptor applied best. However, for several years, a front-page banner stated: &quot;All roads in East Kootenay and West Kootenay lead to Creston.&quot; Prior to the creation of the Regional District of Central Kootenay in 1965, Central Kootenay did not exist as a geographic concept. The RDCK is centred in Nelson.

==History==
The Lower Kootenay Band of the Ktunaxa Nation has occupied the region from time immemorial. Members would paddle their canoes across the flooded flats to harvest wild rice, one of the staples of their diet. The people called the Creston area Yaqan Nukiy, meaning &quot;where the rock stands&quot;. The Kutenai language is noted for its uniqueness, as were the distinctive sturgeon-nosed canoes. Members reside in several local reserves. As of 2020, the Lower Kootenay Band is in Stage 4 of the British Columbia Treaty Process.

Europeans referred to this area as the Goat River district. Established in 1865, the section of the Dewdney Trail travelled southeast via present-day Wynndel and Creston, before following the Goat River valley northeastward. On an 1882 hunting trip, William A. Baillie-Grohman and Teddy Roosevelt camped in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Creston. Baillie-Grohman noted the agricultural potential of the flats if protected from flooding.

==Name origin==
In 1891, three settlers obtained lots. Of today&#x27;s town, John Wilson Dow owned the northern portion, Fred. G. Little, the centre, and John Arrowsmith, the southwestern corner. The Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s twice-weekly sailings between Nelson and Bonners Ferry served the growing community on the edge of the flats.

The place was formerly known as &quot;Fred Little&#x27;s Ranch&quot; and then as the &quot;Eighth Siding&quot; during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The name of &quot;Fisher&quot; was chosen for the initial timetable published in August 1898, assumedly after Sydney Arthur Fisher, a politician friendly to the railway.

Some confusion existed as to whether a rename to &quot;Sirdar&quot; would be adopted. Sirdar was the rank assigned to the commander-in-chief of the British-controlled Egyptian Army in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Lord Kitchener, who had held this position, was equally honoured by the CP station of &quot;Kitchener&quot; northeast. Sirdar, an existing CP station northwest, would also have needed to be renamed in such circumstances.

Residents preferred the name Creston, which appears to have been in popular use. Fred Little selected the name after Creston, Iowa, where he had worked for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, which also stood at the outlet of a major water body. The residents petitioned CP to change the name from Fisher to Creston, a request CP granted before late 1899.

==Railways==
CP accepted offers from Little and Dow for a half-interest in their properties. During construction, the CP rail head passed northwestward toward Kuskonook in September 1898. Although construction trains offered passenger service until mid-October, the line was not handed over to CP until mid-November, but services on the western section did not resume until mid-December. The two-storey station was erected that year.

In December 1899, the Bedlington &amp; Nelson Railway (B&amp;N), a Great Northern Railway subsidiary, assumed possession of the completed line from the main contractor. The route followed today&#x27;s Lower Wynndel Rd (low road). In July 1900, the B&amp;N began limited services and that November, a daily service to Kuskonook. That August, B&amp;N&#x27;s operations north of the junction (Wynndel) were suspended. Soon, there was little activity north of Creston.
Certainly by February 1904, the three times weekly mixed train ran no farther north than Creston. In December 1914, the final twice weekly mixed train ran north to Creston, and the Wynndel–Porthill track was lifted in 1916.

In 1949, CP replaced the former station with a single level flat-roofed one.
Passenger service on the route ended in 1964.
In 1982, the station closed. In 1990, track removal left only one siding, and the brewery spur.

==Early community==
Little and the CP created separate subdivisions, which sold quickly. In late 1898, Robt. J. Long built the first hotel. By 1900, a settlement was growing around Long&#x27;s Creston and John Munroe&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s hotels on the portion of Little&#x27;s subdivision below the tracks. To meet demand, Little further subdivided above the tracks, to where William Crawford and Charles Faas moved their general stores, now the downtown. In 1907, a Canadian Bank of Commerce branch opened. The next year, The Creston Review began publication. Creston was incorporated as a village in 1924. The next year, exchanges of gunfire occurred during a bank robbery. One outlaw was captured the following afternoon. His unidentified partner disappeared with $4,000. In 1930, Dr. Olivier opened an eleven-bed hospital, and the Creston Hotel (1898) burned to the ground. In 1949, the Kootenay Hotel opened. In 1960, Interior Breweries began production at a new brewery. Creston was incorporated as a town in 1966. In 1974, the Labatt Brewing Company acquired 84 per cent of Columbia Brewing Company (the 1972 rename of Interior Breweries).

==Agriculture==
About 1884, likely associated with the Baillie-Grohman reclamation plan, the first settlers arrived, cleared the slopes around today&#x27;s Creston, and planted orchards, but obtained no preemptions. In the early 1890s, William Rodger and Jane Huscroft, with their large family and cattle, squatted on the flats. During 1893, crews dyked the river, but the exceptional flooding during the following spring destroyed much of the work. In partnership with the Kootenay Valley Power and Development Co., settlers completed reconstruction that year, reclaiming . Later deterioration of the dykes resumed annual flooding, leaving the land suitable only for hay harvests.

Apple and cherry orchards were well established by 1920s. As returning World War I veterans developed farms on the flat lands to the south, grain harvests increased. Grain elevators were built in Creston by the Midland Pacific Grain Corporation in 1935 and the Alberta Wheat Pool in 1936 and 1949. Rebuilt dyking of a few years earlier succumbed to floods in 1938 and 1948. The first annual Blossom Festival was held in 1942. In 2018, the Columbia Basin Trust acquired the two remaining abandoned elevators (1935 and 1936) with a view to restoration.

==Lumber==
Small sawmills were established in 1898 and around 1903. In 1907, C.O. Rodgers erected a mill at the mouth of the Goat River gorge. In partnership with D.W. Briggs, he reorganized as the Canyon City Lumber Co. in 1911. After a 1923 fire destroyed the mill, the rebuild, known as Creston Sawmills, opened in 1924. The specialized Rodgers Box Factory catered to the fruit and berry trade. The sawmill closed in 1981 and the buildings torn down. The veneer and planer mills, which closed a decade later, were also demolished.

==Road/air transportation==
By 1909, the highway to Cranbrook was rated as good. By 1910, a passable trail existed east to Lethbridge, which by 1912 was a main road. After realignments, a proper gravel highway opened in 1920. In 1932, the route became the No. 3, Interprovincial Highway, remaining for years the main road connection between the two western provinces.

Southward, a wagon road existed by the 1890s, which was periodically upgraded over the following decades. 

In 1931, the ferry/highway auto route north to Nelson was inaugurated. 

When Canyon St. was widened in 1947 for the new Crowsnest Highway, the frontage buildings moved back.

The October 1963 opening of the Salmo–Creston highway rerouted most traffic from the ferry route.

Creston is served by the Creston Valley Airport formerly known as the Art Sutcliffe Field. In 2017, the pilot of a small plane safely made an emergency landing on Highway 3 west of Creston.

Prior to Greyhound Canada ceasing all intraprovincial services in 2018, an application the prior year included a service reduction via Creston. The summer bus service between Kaslo and Calgary, instituted by a regional operator in 2019, included a Creston stop.

In 2021, the Creston Valley Transit System replaced its fleet of diesel-powered buses with four light-duty, gasoline-driven buses.

==Communications and utilities==
In 1907, the Creston Power Light &amp; Telephone Co (CPL&amp;T) installed phone wires northwest to Duck Creek, east to Erickson, and south to Porthill, Idaho. The next year, the Goat Mountain Waterworks replaced transporting water by wagon from Wynndel.

The excess from electricity generation by the sawmill was sold to the Creston Power, Light and Telephone Company. In 1934, West Kootenay Power &amp; Light (WKP&amp;L) replaced the mill supply, using transmission lines from the Goat River Dam.

In 2015, Telus completed a project to string fibre optic cables for residential and business use.

A $1.1M upgrade in 2017 to the undersized Schikurski Pump Station secured the town water supply.

==Later community==
Creston offers an infrastructure typical of a town of this size, including brewery tours, a shopping mall, golf course and a large selection of motels, hotels, and three campsites. The Ramada hotel (2012) was the first new hotel in Creston in decades. In 2011, the Creston &amp; District Community Complex (1971) received new flooring and upgraded amenities.

The Creston-based Kokanee Beer movie entry won a Gold Lion at the 2013 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. That year, Budweiser production began at the Columbia Brewery.

The Art Deco style Tivoli Theatre (1938) and many of these 1930-ish wood-framed structures in the downtown area seek to mimic this architectural style. The long-vacant Kootenay Hotel has been transformed into a wine bar, taphouse and restaurant. The Creston Hotel has also been extensively modernized.

After a 2015 fire extensively damaged Trinity United Church, reconstruction work did not start until two years later.

==Media==
The Creston Valley is served by AM radio station CFKC-AM at 1340 kHz (rebroadcasting CJAT-FM Trail, BC), and by FM radio stations CKCV-FM at 94.1 MHz, and CBTS-FM at 100.3 MHz (rebroadcasting CBTK-FM Kelowna, BC as part of the CBC Radio One network). Previous to CBTS-FM&#x27;s debut, CBRM was a low-power AM station rebroadcasting CBU Vancouver that was discontinued when CBTS-FM took to the air. The broadcast antennae of CKCV-FM and CBTS-FM are co-located at to the West-northwest of Creston. CIDO-FM formerly broadcast at 97.7 MHz but went dormant in 2016 and its license expired. The local newspaper is the Creston Valley Advance.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Creston had a population of 5,583 living in 2,670 of its 2,810 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,361. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Creston included:
*Irreligion (2,675 persons or 49.8%)
*Christianity (2,525 persons or 47.0%)
*Hinduism (35 persons or 0.7%)
*Buddhism (25 persons or 0.5%)
*Judaism (15 persons or 0.3%)
*Sikhism (10 persons or 0.2%)

==Climate==
Creston has either an inland oceanic climate (Köppen - &quot;Cfb&quot;) or a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), depending on the isotherm used (), though rainfall patterns are such that it just barely avoids being classified as a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot; or &quot;Dsb&quot;). Creston&#x27;s climate is often modified by air masses of the Pacific Ocean origin, especially in winter. Daily maximum temperatures are usually above freezing even in January except when air masses of Arctic origin move over the area. The worst cold outbreaks may send temperatures below on rare occasions. Spring comes early by Canadian standards; trees usually start to leaf out before the end of April. A clear summer day is likely to have a mean daily maximum near or above ; the record maximum is . The last spring frost typically occurs by April 22, and frost usually holds off until around October 18 where air drainage is good.

The mean annual precipitation is in mid-town, but the area has a rather steep precipitation gradient which is reflected in regional ecosystems.

==Flora and fauna==

The moisture-loving western hemlock grows near the town&#x27;s northern boundary; another wet-belt indicator, the western redcedar, is common in the area. The sun-loving ponderosa pine forms a larger proportion of the vegetation near Creston&#x27;s southern boundary. Douglas-fir is the most common native tree throughout; other large conifers include grand fir, western larch, western white pine and lodgepole pine. Large pines other than the ponderosa are seldom seen in town, but are common in some of the woods nearby. The only native deciduous tree which matches the conifers in size is the black cottonwood. White birch and trembling aspen grow to medium size; smaller trees include the Rocky Mountain maple and bitter cherry. Prominent among the non-native trees are blue spruce, horse-chestnut, Norway maple, silver maple, and several species of walnut, including the butternut. There also are occasional examples of catalpa, chestnut, London plane, and tulip tree.

Large mammals at Creston include cougar, bear, beaver, coyote, deer, elk, moose, muskrat and river otter. More than 265 bird species occur in the Creston Valley, which is in a migration corridor for waterfowl such as geese and swans; the valley is also a wintering area for birds of prey. The Creston area hosts British Columbia&#x27;s only remaining population of northern leopard frog.

==Physiography and soils==
Creston is built on rolling bench-land immediately to the east of the Kootenay River floodplain. Beyond the bench-land to the east are the Purcell Mountains; their steep west-facing scarps are mistakenly called the Skimmerhorns, while the Selkirk Mountains rise west of the floodplain.

Silt loam is the most common soil texture at Creston. The floodplain soils are dark and poorly drained for the most part; they are excellent for pasture and grains where drainage is improved. Some of the bench-land soils are brown and of good tilth; others are gray, deficient in organic matter, and have rather heavy calcareous subsoils.

<text>Hafetz Haim (, &quot;lit.&quot; desirous of life) is a religious kibbutz in central Israel. Located in the Shephelah, it falls under the jurisdiction of Nahal Sorek Regional Council. 
In it had a population of .

==History==
The land on which Hafetz Haim was established was purchased by the Jewish National Fund. The land had traditionally belonged to the Palestinian village of Al-Mukhayzin.

The first Jewish settlement was established there on 15 August 1937 as part of the tower and stockade movement. It was named Sha&#x27;ar HaNegev, &quot;Gate of the Negev&quot;, and then Kfar Szold, &quot;Szold Village&quot; (after Henrietta Szold). However, on 13 November 1942 the community moved to the Finger of the Galilee, where they established a new kibbutz, also called Kfar Szold.

On 25 April 1944 a new kibbutz was established. The founders were religious pioneers from Germany and members of the Ezra youth movement and Agudat Yisrael who had been preparing near Kfar Saba. It was the first village founded by Poalei Agudat Yisrael and was named after rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, who was also known as the &quot;Hafetz Haim&quot; after one of his famous works with the title “Chofetz Chaim”, trans. &quot;Desirer of Life&quot;.
==Archaeology==
In 2010, a Byzantine-era octagonal wine press measuring 6.5 meters by 16.5 meters was discovered in excavations near Kibbutz Hafetz Haim.

==Career==
===Early beginnings===
Željko Joksimović was born on 20 April 1972 in Belgrade and grew up in the city of Valjevo. Joksimović&#x27;s first international success came at the age of 12 when he won the title of &quot;First Accordion of Europe&quot; at the prestigious music festival in Paris. He graduated music at the University of Belgrade and launched his professional music career in 1997. In 1998 he won a contest at the Pjesma Mediterana festival with the song &quot;Pesma Sirena&quot;, which led to opportunities to perform at more prestigious festivals in Belarus. The Serbian musician won the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; award at two festivals in that country.

===1999–2003: &quot;Amajlija&quot;, &quot;Rintam&quot; and &quot;111&quot;===
The young singer was promoted as a folk and pop artist. His first studio album, titled &quot;Amajlija&quot;, included &quot;Pesma Sirena&quot; along with seven other tracks. His first big success was with the single &quot;7 godina&quot;, written by himself and Leontina Vukomanović. The song went to No. 1 on the Serbian pop music charts and became very popular in other former Yugoslav countries.

In 1999 he won his first big prize when becoming the Grand Prix winner of the International Festival of Arts Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk, Belarus.

In 2001, Joksimović released his second studio album &quot;Vreteno&quot; named after a song on the album. Other tracks on the album included &quot;Rintam&quot;, &quot;Balada&quot;, &quot;Gadura&quot; and the duet with Haris Džinović &quot;Šta će meni više od toga&quot;. Three music videos were produced for songs on this album.

&quot;111&quot; was released in 2002, soaring to No.1 on the pop charts of Serbia and other countries of the region. Some of the songs included were &quot;Varnice&quot;, &quot;Zaboravljaš&quot; and &quot;Karavan&quot;.

In 2003, Joksimović wrote the song &quot;Čija si&quot; for Macedonian music singer Toše Proeski which led him to win Beovizija.

===2004: Eurovision Song Contest 2004===
Serbia and Montenegro, sending an entrant for the first time to 2004 Eurovision Song Contest, decided on their representative through Evropesma 2004, a music festival and contest in Serbia and Montenegro. Joksimović won the contest with &quot;Lane Moje&quot;, composed by Željko himself, along with lyricist Leontina Vukomanović.

In the semi-final, Joksimović placed first. However, in the final, he placed second behind Ukrainian singer Ruslana, but received the &quot;Marcel Bezencon Press Award&quot; (Best Composer Award). &quot;Lane Moje&quot; was the best-selling single in Serbia and Montenegro.

The song has become popular amongst many Eurovision fans and it is often rated as one of the best non-winning songs.

===2004–2007: After first Eurovision, &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;Platinum Collection&quot;===

After the success in the Contest, the same year, Joksimović founded &quot;MINACORD PRODUCTION&quot;. Since then, he has worked and composed in his studio. In 2007 he composed and released the single &quot;Ledja o Ledja&quot; which gained a large popularity in the countries where Željko usually performs. In 2005, he once again composed a song for Serbia and Montenegro&#x27;s national pre-selection for Eurovision called Beovizija. Željko composed the ballad &quot;Jutro&quot; (Morning) which was performed by Jelena Tomašević. In October 2005, he composed and performed a duet with Austrian singer Tamee Harrison. The song was titled &quot;I Live My Life For You&quot;&quot; which was a success throughout Europe. Around this time, Željko wrote his first film score. In cooperation with &quot;Cobra Production&quot;, he composed music for the movie &quot;Ivkova slava&quot; (Ivko&#x27;s fame). The same year he released his fourth studio album &quot;IV&quot; or &quot;Ima nešto u tom što me nećeš&quot;. In this album, he changed the music style that was typical of him. The songs in the album are Pop ballads with some ethnic Serbian folk elements. In 2006, he composed the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 song &quot;Lejla&quot; for Bosnia and Herzegovina, performed by Hari Mata Hari. The song finished in third place, making it Bosnia&#x27;s best performance in the contest. He also won the prestigious Best Composer Award (COMPOSERAWARD 2006), assigned to Željko by all composers who participated in that festival.

In 2007, he released his second greatest hits compilation called &quot;Platinum Collection&quot; which included two new singles &quot;Devojka&quot; and &quot;Nije do mene&quot;. He also composed the music for the TV series &quot;Ranjeni orao&quot; and &quot;Ono nase sto nekad bejase&quot;. The same year, in front of 18,000 people Joksimović made a concert where he sang all of his hits in the Belgrade Arena released in the DVD titled &quot;Koncert Beogradska Arena&quot;.

===2008–2011: Eurovision hosting and &quot;Ljubavi&quot;===

In early 2008, Željko Joksimović composed a song that was performed by Jelena Tomašević in the Serbian national final for the Eurovision song selection, Beovizija 2008, called &quot;Oro&quot;. The song is a folk ballad with traditional folk Serbian elements. Because the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 has been won by Serbia, the contest that year came in the country. On 24 March 2008 it was announced by the 2008 Eurovision organizers RTS that together with Jovana Janković he would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, giving him two roles in the contest. Tomašević&#x27;s song finished in the 6th place in over 25 countries in the final.
The song came six with 160 points, with OGAE Greece ranking it their favorite of the year.

After a year of a music pause, he released his fifth studio album named &quot;Ljubavi&quot; (2009) by the production of Minacord and City Records. &quot;Ljubavi&quot; is the name of the pilot single of the album too. The single has a large success in Serbia and the neighboring countries. In early 2010 he released the second single from the album called &quot;Žena Za Sva Vremena&quot;.

On 12 June 2010, he performed his biggest concert yet. It was held on the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which can seat 37,500, though attendance for concerts can be expanded to reach about 80,000, in front of over 40,000 persons.
===2012: Eurovision return===
Joksimović represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The song was called &quot;Nije ljubav stvar&quot; composed and performed by Joksimović. The lyrics are by Marina Tucaković and Miloš Roganović. The English version of the song called &quot;Synonym&quot; by Ljilja Jorgovanović. Željko Joksimović and Alek Alekov did the arrangements of both versions. James Cruz, an award-winning audio-mastering engineer in his New York studio, did the postproduction and mastering. The song was a great success, finishing in third place.

<text>USS &quot;Piper&quot; (SS/AGSS-409), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named after the piper. Although built late in World War II, &quot;Piper&quot; completed three successful war patrols before the cessation of hostilities, operating as a life guard for plane strikes and as an advance picket for fast carrier task forces.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Piper&quot; (originally named &quot;Awa&quot;) was laid down 15 March 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine; launched 26 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Charles W. Wilkins; commissioned 23 August 1944.

== First patrol, January – March 1945 ==

&quot;Piper&quot; began her war career on 25 January 1945, when she slipped out of Pearl Harbor as the leader of a five-ship wolfpack. Piper was joined in the wolfpack by , , , and , known as &quot;MAC&#x27;s MOPS.&quot; The mission was an anti-picket boat sweep in preparation for carrier strikes on Honshū. After a short stop at Saipan, the pack arrived in the assigned area south of Iwo Jima 10 February. Three sweeps from 10 February to 13 February revealed no picket boats.

&quot;Piper&quot; spent the period from 15 February to 24 March off the south and southeast coasts of Honshū serving alternately on independent patrol and lifeguard duty for the then intensive B-29 and carrier strikes against Japan. On the night of 25 February, &quot;Piper&quot; found her first target. In a night surface attack, she sank an unidentified 2,000-ton vessel. The last four days before departure were spent guarding the approaches to Bungo Suido against a possible Japanese sortie against the badly-damaged carrier .

== Second patrol, April – June 1945 ==

&quot;Piper&quot; arrived at Midway 30 March 1945 for refit and training, and departed 26 April for her second war patrol in another wolf pack. The ships arrived in the patrol area, the Sea of Okhotsk, 3 May 1945, and from 14 May to 25 May made concentrated surface sweeps of the area.

The remainder of the period was spent on independent war patrol, rotating stations. On 27 May &quot;Piper&quot; got her first chance on this patrol when she sighted two small merchantmen with two escorts in Boussole Channel. Working her way through a heavy fog, she launched a surface torpedo attack, sinking one 4,000-ton merchantman. The escorts dropped a few depth charges, but none were close to the mark.

== Third patrol, July – August 1945 ==

&quot;Piper&quot; departed the area 4 June 1945, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 13 June. Lieutenant Commander Edward L. Beach Jr. assumed command on 25 June. On 19 July 1945 she departed on her third war patrol, stopping en route at Guam for advanced training from 1 August to 4 August. On 11 August, &quot;Piper&quot; accounted for two five-ton fishing vessels in Koshiki Kaikyo, and on 13 August she entered the Sea of Japan. There she rescued six prisoners of war; Japan capitulated the next day.

== 1945 – 1951 ==

On 3 September she headed for Pearl Harbor and onward routing to the United States. &quot;Piper&quot; arrived 15 October 1945 at the U.S. Naval Submarine Base, New London, Conn. During the next five years, &quot;Piper&quot; remained in the New London area with the exception of cruises to Nassau, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and overhauls in Portsmouth and Philadelphia Naval Shipyards.

On 2 May 1950 &quot;Piper&quot; got under way for a tour of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon her return to the States she made a six-week cruise to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for special exercises.

== 1951 – 1958 ==

In June 1951 &quot;Piper&quot; went to the Charleston Naval Shipyard for Fleet Snorkel conversion which gave her the streamlined &quot;new look&quot; and snorkel gear. For the next few years the submarine operated out of New London along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean.

In July 1955 &quot;Piper&quot; got under way for her second tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. January 1956 found her operating in the Caribbean again. From March to September she underwent an extensive overhaul in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

On 1 July 1957, Rear Admiral Charles W. Wilkins, Commander Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet selected &quot;Piper&quot; as his flagship. His wife had christened &quot;Piper&quot; at her launching in 1944. In September &quot;Piper&quot; sailed for an eight-week NATO exercise in the North Atlantic. In 1958, after completing almost a full year as Flagship of the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Piper&quot; was relieved by .

== 1958 – 1966 ==

On 6 November 1959 &quot;Piper&quot; departed New London for a three-month deployment with the 6th Fleet. Throughout 1960 she remained in the New London area. On 20 February 1961 the submarine got underway for exercises in the Caribbean. On this cruise she became the first snorkel submarine to make her 10,000th dive.

In the fall of 1962 &quot;Piper&quot; was deployed in the Caribbean area during the Cuban Missile Crisis. &quot;Piper&quot; commenced another Mediterranean deployment 8 October 1963. She transited the Suez Canal to Karachi, Pakistan to participate with the Navies of the CENTO nations in exercise Midlink VI and returned to the Mediterranean early in December for operations with the 6th Fleet before returning to New London 1 February 1964.

During 1964, in conjunction with Atlantic Fleet exercises, &quot;Piper&quot; together with visited Portsmouth, England and Rotterdam, Netherlands. After an overhaul in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard during the first six months of 1965, &quot;Piper&quot; sailed for the first of two Caribbean deployments 15 October, returning from the second 10 April 1966. For the remainder of that year she operated out of Submarine School, New London.

== 1967 – 1970 ==

On 22 March 1967, &quot;Pipers main storage battery had deteriorated to the extent that the ship was restricted to surface operations. At this time &quot;Piper&quot; had made 13,724 dives, a record for commissioned submarines. On 10 May &quot;Piper&quot; entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for deactivation. On 15 June &quot;Piper&quot; was reclassified as AGSS-409&quot;&#x27; and the next day she was placed &quot;out of commission, special&quot;, and replaced as the Detroit, Mich., Naval Reserve Training submarine.

&quot;Piper&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1970. She was sold for scrapping in June 1971.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Piper&quot; received four battle stars for service in World War II.

<text>Bar Refaeli (; born ) is an Israeli model, actress, and businesswoman. She is among the most internationally successful models to come from Israel, appearing on the cover of the 2009 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue, and being voted No. 1 on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 list of 2012. As a television host, Refaeli has hosted &quot;The X Factor Israel&quot; since 2013 and co-hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv.

As a result of her modeling and investment careers, her net worth was estimated at US$20 million in 2015. She was the highest-paid model in Israel according to &quot;Forbes&quot; Israel in 2013.

==Early life==

Refaeli was born and raised in Hod HaSharon, Israel, to a secular Jewish family. In Hebrew, her first name means &quot;wild&quot; (as in wilderness), and her surname literally means &quot;my God heals&quot; and is a derivative of the biblical angel Raphael. Her parents were both born in Israel, and her grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Italy, Lithuania and Poland. Her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. Her father Refael &quot;Rafi&quot; Refaeli is a former horse stable owner, and her mother was a model in the 1970s under her maiden name Tzipora &quot;Tzipi&quot; Levine. Refaeli has two younger brothers; On Refaeli is an actor and model, and Dor Refaeli is an entrepreneur. She also has an older half-brother, Neil Ben-Porat, from her mother&#x27;s first marriage to Israeli businessman Yehousha &quot;Shuki&quot; Ben-Porat.

==Career==
===Modeling===
Refaeli began modeling at the age of eight months, when she first appeared in commercials. Orthodonture at 12 interrupted her modeling until she was 15, when an Israeli fashion awards ceremony awarded Refaeli &quot;Model of the Year&quot; (2000). She played prominently in campaigns for the fashion brands &quot;Castro&quot; and &quot;Pilpel&quot;, and she starred in a Milky pudding commercial.

She has appeared in editorials for French, American, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian &quot;Elle&quot;, Spanish &quot;Vogue&quot;, British, Russian, Australian, and Vietnamese &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, French and Dutch &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;, American, British, Italian, German, Spanish, and Indian &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;i-D&quot;, and &quot;Allure&quot;.
She has appeared on the covers of French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Russian, Belgian, Danish, Swedish, Australian, Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian, Slovenian, Croatian, and Turkish &quot;Elle&quot;, French, Spanish, and Russian &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, British, Italian, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Mexican &quot;GQ&quot;, American, British, Australian, and Serbian &quot;Maxim&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;.

Refaeli has appeared in advertising campaigns for Chanel, Escada, Ralph Lauren, Desigual, Andrew Marc, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Marks and Spencer, Gap, Moët &amp; Chandon, Hurley, Rampage, True Religion, Lucky Brand, Accessorize, Passionata, Fox, Reebok, Sears, Arrow, Besni, Marco Bicego, and Agua Bendita. She also has appeared in advertising-campaigns for non-fashion brands such as Garnier Fructis, Samsung, and Subaru.

Refaeli became the second Israeli model to appear in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine (after Michaela Bercu), in her 2007 debut in its Swimsuit Issue, where she posed with the rock band Aerosmith. Refaeli was the cover-model for the 2009 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue. In a promotional deal with Sports Illustrated, Southwest Airlines painted a bikini-clad Refaeli from that shoot on the side of its Boeing 737, which led some passengers to criticize the airline for plastering a picture they regarded as prurient, and hence &quot;offensive to families.&quot;
Refaeli has modeled for Subaru, Accessorize, Brazilian clothing line Besni, Italian jewelry line Marco Bicego, and Rampage. In 2009, she modeled for Garnier International.

On 5 March 2009, Refaeli received the World Style Award presented by the Women&#x27;s World Awards for her &quot;natural elegance, sense of style, and compassion.&quot; In October of the same year, Refaeli co-hosted Fashionable Istanbul&#x27;s press conference, announced its October 2009 fashion event, and appeared in its advèrtisements. &quot;FHM&quot; voted Refaeli No. 42 in 2008, No. 57 in 2010, and No. 97 in 2011, in its lists of the &quot;100 Sexiest Women.&quot;

&quot;Maxim&quot; placed Refaeli at the very top of its Hot 100 list in 2012. In April 2012, &quot;Shalom Life&quot; ranked her fourth on its list of the &quot;50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish women in the world.&quot;

According to &quot;Forbes Israel&quot;, in 2013 she was the highest-paid model in Israel, ahead of the combined modelling income of such other Israeli models as Esti Ginzburg, Gal Gadot, and Shlomit Malka.

In 2013 she also received a Vienna Fashion Award in the category of &quot;Style-Icon&quot;.

As of March 2017, Refaeli was the second most influential person on Israeli Instagram, according to the Israeli Internet Association, behind Anna Zak, but ahead of Neta Alchimister.

===Film, television, and stage===
Refaeli co-starred in the Israeli TV drama series &quot;Pick Up&quot; in 2005. In October 2008, she co-hosted the Bravo special program &quot;Tommy Hilfiger Presents Ironic Iconic America&quot;, based on the book &quot;Ironic Iconic America&quot; written by George Lois. She returned as a program host in 2009, this time for MTV&#x27;s brief revival of &quot;House of Style&quot;.

In 2009, she was also a guest-judge at Project Runway Israel.

In 2011, Refaeli starred in the American-Israeli film &quot;Session&quot;, directed by Haim Bouzaglo. The film is a psychological thriller that tells the story of a manipulative psychiatrist who becomes obsessed with a new young patient. She also served as a guest judge on cycle four of &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot; hosted by Heidi Klum. In November 2012 she started her own model casting show &quot;Million Dollar Shootingstar&quot; on German TV Channel Sat.1.

In late 2012, she played the titular role in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, a musical adaptation staged for Channukkah in Israel.

In January 2013, Refaeli appeared in Go Daddy&#x27;s Super Bowl XLVII commercial. In 2013, Refaeli also hosted the first season of &quot;The X Factor Israel&quot;, which became the most popular music show in Israel, leading to them bringing her back in 2015 for season two. In 2018 Refaeli appeared in a music video of X Factor judge, Ivri Lider. In 2013, Refaeli played a starring role in the French-Israeli crime-caper film &quot;Kidon&quot;, a comedy in which she stars as a Mossad assassin involved in liquidating a terrorist.

Assi Azar reportedly wrote the hit Israeli TV series, &quot;Beauty and the Baker&quot; with Refaeli in mind for the lead role. Rotem Sela eventually played the role that Refaeli reportedly turned down.

Refaeli hosted the main event of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv alongside Erez Tal, whereas Assi Azar and Lucy Ayoub hosted the Green Room (Artists&#x27; backstage).

===Business and investment===

Refaeli has an ownership stake in a number of Israeli fashion companies, such as in the designer glasses manufacturer Carolina Lemke. In September 2018 it was announced that Kim Kardashian would be the face of the brand alongside Refaeli, with the two appearing in a promotional campaign together.

On the sale of a 5% stake to Israeli fashion brand Castro in 2016, Refaeli made a NIS 2-4 million profit.

In 2011, Refaeli and Dudi Balsar, an Israeli attorney and former male model, set up an E-commerce company called Under.me, to sell designer underwear. As well as being its investor, Refaeli runs business development for the venture. By November 2011, the company had raised $1 million in venture capital funds.

In 2013, her startup Mika Look, which is an iPad app that allows users to purchase the items that models are wearing, raised $1.2 million in its first financing round.

Refaeli is one of the main investors behind MyCheck, which processes payments behind smart phones, and which raised $1.7 million in its first financing round. In its second financing round, it raised $4.2 million.

==Activism and charity==
Refaeli participated in a campaign to help reduce the use of plastic bags in Israel. In 2009, she led an unpaid campaign on behalf of the Israel Water Authority, to educate the public about water use and conservation.

On 7 June 2013, Refaeli hosted a beach party in Tel Aviv for participants of Tel Aviv Pride, the city&#x27;s gay pride parade. In November 2013, she spoke out in support of legislation for civil marriages in Israel, as part of a campaign for the proposed Knesset bill.

Refaeli hosted the closing ceremony for the 2017 Maccabiah Games in Latrun, Israel, on 18 July 2017.

== Controversies ==

=== Military service ===
As early as 2004, Refaeli received criticism in her country for avoiding its mandatory service in the army. At the time, fellow Israeli model Agam Rudberg said: &quot;The way Bar Refaeli evaded army-service wasn&#x27;t right. It&#x27;s worth trying to serve in the army, and only if you don&#x27;t feel good there to try to do something.&quot;

In 2007, Ynetnews reported that Refaeli had evaded the draft by marrying family-acquaintance Arik Weinstein in 2003, and divorcing him soon afterwards. Military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is mandatory in Israel for unmarried secular Jewish women over the age of 18.

The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden threatened to boycott the Israeli fashion chain Fox if they hired her. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she was in Israel, and actively encourage army enlistment. Refaeli later said, &quot;I don&#x27;t regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That&#x27;s just the way it is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army.&quot; She also said: &quot;Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no difference to me. Why is it good to die for our country? What, isn&#x27;t it better to live in New York? Why should 18-year-old kids have to die? It&#x27;s dumb that people have to die so that I can live in Israel.&quot;

In 2009, while speaking in support of enlisting, fellow Israeli model Esti Ginzburg also criticized Refaeli for evading military-service. Two years later, Refaeli was featured on the cover of Italian &quot;GQ&quot;″s war-themed May 2011 issue. Refaeli&#x27;s avoidance of military service was again raised in 2013, this time by IDF Brigadier General Yoav Mordechai, who criticized the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for casting her in a 2013 advertisement. Mordechai maintained that the use of Refaeli as an &quot;official representative of Israel&quot; sent a &quot;negative message&quot; to Israeli society.

Ever since 2014, during the IDF&#x27;s Operation Protective Edge (2014 Gaza War), Refaeli has frequently expressed solidarity and appreciation of fellow Israeli citizens who have been serving in the Israeli military while posting on her social network accounts; one of which was done by simply sharing her own photos hugging young and cheerful combat Israeli troops.

=== Tax evasion ===
In late 2015, Refaeli was accused of concealing millions of shekels of annual income, despite an estimated net worth of US$20 million in 2015. It was revealed she had recently bought a NIS 15 million apartment in Tel Aviv, as well as a NIS 2.5 million apartment for her younger brother. On 16 December 2015, Israeli tax authorities in Tel Aviv detained her and her mother overnight for questioning related to potential tax evasion; she was accused of failing to pay income tax on two vehicles that she received as compensation for posing in pictures with the vehicles, and for evading taxes by disguising her Israeli residency by renting a luxury apartment in Tel Aviv through relatives.

On 3 January 2019, it was announced that Refaeli was suspected of tax-evasion and was facing a possible indictment along with her parents. In April 22, 2019, Refaeli&#x27;s appeal was rejected and she was ordered to pay taxes on her concealed income of $4.5 million. She was accepted plea bargain which would result in a prison sentence for her mother, Tzipi Levine-Refaeli, and heavy fines for them both. Refaeli was sentenced in June 2020 to 9 months of community service in the form of volunteer work at an educational facility for mentally disabled adults, fined $720,000, and made to pay the $2.3 million in back taxes she owed. Her mother was given a 16-month long prison sentence, of which she served 8 months in at Neve Tirza Prison in Ramla, and fined as well.

=== Identity theft ===
In 2016, Refaeli lodged a police complaint for identity theft after a news item on &quot;Calcalist&quot; linked her to suspicious money transfers involving Amir Bramly, based on leaked banking correspondence. Bramly sued the &quot;Calcalist&quot; reporter in relation to the media coverage.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Refaeli married family friend Arik Weinstein. Refaeli was criticized for the marriage as it was widely reported she only married Weinstein in order to avoid being drafted into the Israel Defense Forces. They divorced sometime in 2005. Weinstein published a memoir about their marriage, titled &quot;The Untold Story: by Arik Weinstein First Husband of Bar Refael&quot;, in 2017.

In November 2005, Refaeli began a relationship with American actor Leonardo DiCaprio, after meeting him at a party in Las Vegas for members of U2. In the course of their trip to Israel in March 2007, the couple met Israeli President Shimon Peres and visited her hometown of Hod HaSharon. The relationship ended in June 2009. In 2010, numerous reports indicated that their romance had been rekindled, but in May 2011, it was reported that they had ended their romantic relationship and would remain friends.

She married Israeli businessman Adi Ezra on 24 September 2015 in Israel. They have two daughters and a son.

<text>Mildred Dresselhaus (&#x27;Spiewak&quot;&#x27;; November 11, 1930 – February 20, 2017), known as the &quot;Queen of Carbon Science&quot;, was an American physicist, materials scientist, and nanotechnologist. She was an institute professor and professor of both physics and electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also served as the president of the American Physical Society, the chair of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as the director of science in the US Department of Energy under the Bill Clinton Government. Dresselhaus won numerous awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, the Enrico Fermi Award, the Kavli Prize and the Vannevar Bush Award.

== Early life and education ==
Dresselhaus was born on November 11, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York City, the daughter of Ethel (Teichtheil) and Meyer Spiewak, who were Polish Jewish immigrants. Her family was heavily affected by the Great Depression so from a young age Dresselhaus helped provide income for the family by doing piecework assembly tasks at home and by working in a zipper factory during the summer. As a grade school student, Dresselhaus&#x27; first &#x27;teaching job&#x27; was tutoring a special-needs student for fifty cents a week, and she learned how to be a good teacher.

Dresselhaus credited New York&#x27;s free museums, including the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with sparking her interest in science. She and her brother, Irving Spiewak, were scholarship students at the Greenwich House Music School which introduced her to a different world of musical, artistic and intellectual leanings.

Dresselhaus was raised and attended grade school in the Bronx. Her older brother informed her of the opportunity to apply to Hunter College High School, where she excelled and gained practice as a teacher by tutoring fellow students.

=== Experience at Hunter College ===
Dresselhaus attended Hunter College in New York. Traditionally a women&#x27;s college, during Dresselhaus&#x27;s time as a student there, Hunter College&#x27;s Bronx campus opened itself to a flood of male G.I. Bill beneficiaries. Dresselhaus later explained:
The boys in the science classes were toward the bottom of the class... They always used to come to me for help... That might be somewhat significant in my story, because I &quot;never&quot; got the idea in college that science was a man&#x27;s profession.
While attending Hunter, one of her professors, and future Nobel-Prize-winner Rosalyn Yalow took interest in Dresselhaus and encouraged her to apply for graduate fellowships and pursue a career in physics. Dresselhaus graduated with her undergraduate degree in liberal arts in 1951.

=== After college ===
She carried out postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge on a Fulbright Fellowship and received her MA from Radcliffe College. She received a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1958 where she studied under Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi. She then spent two years at Cornell University as a postdoc before moving to Lincoln Lab as a staff member.

== Career and legacy ==
Dresselhaus had a 57-year career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She became the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Visiting Professor of electrical engineering at MIT in 1967, became a tenured faculty member in 1968, and became a professor of physics in 1983. In 1985, she was appointed the first female institute professor at MIT. In 1994, Dresselhaus was one of 16 women faculty in the School of Science at MIT who drafted and co-signed a letter to the then-Dean of Science (now Chancellor of Berkeley) Robert Birgeneau, which started a campaign to highlight and challenge gender discrimination at MIT.

As the exotic compounds she studied became increasingly relevant to modern science and engineering, she was uniquely positioned to become a world-leading expert and write one of the standard textbooks. 
Her groundwork in the field led to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov isolating and characterizing graphene, for which they were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize.

Dresselhaus was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1990 in recognition of her work on electronic properties of materials as well as expanding the opportunities of women in science and engineering. In 2005 she was awarded the 11th Annual Heinz Award in the category of Technology, the Economy and Employment. In 2008, she was awarded the Oersted Medal. In 2012, she was co-recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award, along with Burton Richter, and was awarded the Kavli Prize &quot;for her pioneering contributions to the study of phonons, electron-phonon interactions, and thermal transport in nanostructures.&quot; In 2014, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and was inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2015, she received the IEEE Medal of Honor.

In 2000–2001, she was the director of the Office of Science at the U.S. Department of Energy. From 2003 to 2008, she was the chair of the governing board of the American Institute of Physics. She also has served as president of the American Physical Society (APS), the first female president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and treasurer of the National Academy of Sciences.

Her former students include such notable materials scientists as Deborah Chung, and physicists as Nai-Chang Yeh and Greg Timp.
There are several physical theories named after Dresselhaus. The Hicks-Dresselhaus Model (L. D. Hicks and Dresselhaus) is the first basic model for low-dimensional thermoelectrics, which initiated the whole band field. The Saito-Fujita-Dresselhaus Model (Riichiro Saito, Mitsutaka Fujita, Gene Dresselhaus, and Mildred Dresselhaus) first predicted the band structures of carbon nanotubes. The Dresselhaus effect refers, however, to the spin–orbit interaction effect modeled by Gene Dresselhaus, Mildred Dresselhaus&#x27;s husband.

Dresselhaus devoted a great deal of time to supporting efforts to promote increased participation of women in physics. In 1971, Dresselhaus and a colleague organized the first Women&#x27;s Forum at MIT as a seminar exploring the roles of women in science and engineering. In honor of her legacy, the APS created the Millie Dresselhaus Fund to support women in physics. Dresselhaus was the face of a 2017 General Electric television advertisement which asked the question &quot;What if female scientists were celebrities?&quot; aimed to increase the number of women in STEM roles in its ranks.

In 2019, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Board of Directors created the IEEE Mildred Dresselhaus Medal, awarded annually &quot;for outstanding technical contributions in science and engineering, of great impact to IEEE fields of interest.&quot;

==Contributions to scientific knowledge==
Dresselhaus was particularly noted for her work on graphite, graphite intercalation compounds, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and low-dimensional thermoelectrics. Her group made frequent use of electronic band structure, Raman scattering and the photophysics of carbon nanostructures. Her research helped develop technology based on thin graphite which allow electronics to be &quot;everywhere&quot;, including clothing and smartphones.

With the appearance of lasers in the 1960s, Dresselhaus started to use lasers for magneto-optics experiments, which later led to the creation of a new model for the electronic structure of graphite. A great part of her research dedicates to the study of &#x27;buckyballs&#x27; and graphene focusing a great deal in the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes and enhancing thermoelectric properties of nanowires.

== Personal life ==

Her first husband was physicist Frederick Reif. She remarried in 1958 to Gene Dresselhaus who became a well known theoretician and discoverer of the Dresselhaus effect. They had four children – Marianne, Carl, Paul, and Eliot – and five grandchildren.

<text>Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood (19 June 1897 – 9 October 1967) was a British physical chemist and expert in chemical kinetics. His work in reaction mechanisms earned the 1956 Nobel Prize in chemistry.

==Education==
Born in London, his parents were Norman Macmillan Hinshelwood, a chartered accountant, and Ethel Frances née Smith. He was educated first in Canada, returning in 1905 on the death of his father to a small flat in Chelsea where he lived for the rest of his life. He then studied at Westminster City School and Balliol College, Oxford.

==Career==
During the First World War, Hinshelwood was a chemist in an explosives factory. He was a tutor at Trinity College, Oxford, from 1921 to 1937 and was Dr Lee&#x27;s Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford from 1937. He served on several advisory councils on scientific matters to the British Government.

His early studies of molecular kinetics led to the publication of &quot;Thermodynamics for Students of Chemistry&quot; and &quot;The Kinetics of Chemical Change&quot; in 1926. With Harold Warris Thompson he studied the explosive reaction of hydrogen and oxygen and described the phenomenon of chain reaction. His subsequent work on chemical changes in the bacterial cell proved to be of great importance in later research work on antibiotics and therapeutic agents, and his book, &quot;The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell&quot; was published in 1946, followed by &quot;Growth, Function and Regulation in Bacterial Cells&quot; in 1966. In 1951 he published &quot;The Structure of Physical Chemistry&quot;. It was republished as an Oxford Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences by Oxford University Press in 2005.

The Langmuir-Hinshelwood process in heterogeneous catalysis, in which the adsorption of the reactants on the surface is the rate-limiting step, is named after him. He was a senior research fellow at Imperial College London from 1964 to 1967.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to being named the second at Oxford, Hinshelwood was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1929, serving as president from 1955 to 1960. He was knighted in 1948 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1960. With Nikolay Semenov of the USSR, Hinshelwood was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1956 for his researches into the mechanism of chemical reactions. He was also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

Hinshelwood was president of the Chemical Society, the Royal Society, the Classical Association, and the Faraday Society, and received numerous awards and honorary degrees.

==Personal life==
Hinshelwood never married. He was fluent in seven classical and modern languages and his main hobbies were painting, collecting Chinese pottery, and foreign literature. As an artist, Hinshelwood painted scenes in Oxford, as well as portraits of Oxford University people including Harold Hartley, his doctoral supervisor, and Herbert Blakiston, the President of Trinity College. The portrait of Hartley is now owned by the Royal Society, and that of Blakiston is owned by Trinity College, as are a number of Hinshelwood&#x27;s other paintings.

He died, at home, on 9 October 1967. In 1968, his Nobel Prize medal was sold by his estate to a collector, who then sold it in 1976 for $15,000. In 2017, his Nobel Prize medal was sold at auction for $128,000.
