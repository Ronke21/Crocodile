<text>OMAP (Open Multimedia Applications Platform) is a family of image/video processors that was developed by Texas Instruments. They are proprietary system on chips (SoCs) for portable and mobile multimedia applications. OMAP devices generally include a general-purpose ARM architecture processor core plus one or more specialized co-processors. Earlier OMAP variants commonly featured a variant of the Texas Instruments TMS320 series digital signal processor.

The platform was created after December 12, 2002, as STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments jointly announced an initiative for &quot;Open Mobile Application Processor Interfaces&quot; (OMAPI) intended to be used with 2.5 and 3G mobile phones, that were going to be produced during 2003. (This was later merged into a larger initiative and renamed the MIPI Alliance.) The OMAP was Texas Instruments&#x27; implementation of this standard. (The STMicroelectronics implementation was named Nomadik.)

OMAP enjoyed some success in the smartphone and tablet market until 2011 when it lost ground to Qualcomm Snapdragon. On September 26, 2012, Texas Instruments announced that they would wind down their operations in smartphone and tablet oriented chips and focus on embedded platforms instead. On November 14, 2012, Texas Instruments announced they would cut 1,700 jobs due to their shift from mobile to embedded platforms. The last OMAP5 chips were released in Q2 2013.

== OMAP family ==

The OMAP family consists of three product groups classified by performance and intended application:
* high-performance applications processors
* basic multimedia applications processors
* integrated modem and applications processors

Further, two main distribution channels exist, and not all parts are available in both channels. The genesis of the OMAP product line is from partnership with cell phone vendors, and the main distribution channel involves sales directly to such &quot;wireless handset&quot; vendors. Parts developed to suit evolving cell phone requirements are flexible and powerful enough to support sales through less specialized &quot;catalog&quot; channels; some OMAP 1 parts, and many OMAP 3 parts, have catalog versions with different sales and support models. Parts that are obsolete from the perspective of handset vendors may still be needed to support products developed using catalog parts and distributor-based inventory management.

=== High-performance applications processors ===
These are parts originally intended for use as application processors in smartphones, with processors powerful enough to run significant operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD, Android or Symbian), support connectivity to personal computers, and support various audio and video applications.

==== OMAP 1 ====
The OMAP 1 family started with a TI-enhanced ARM925 core (ARM925T), and then changed to a standard ARM926 core. It included many variants, most easily distinguished according to manufacturing technology (130 nm except for the OMAP171x series), CPU, peripheral set, and distribution channel (direct to large handset vendors, or through catalog-based distributors). In March 2009, the OMAP1710 family chips are still available to handset vendors.

Products using OMAP 1 processors include hundreds of cell phone models, and the Nokia 770 Internet tablets.
* OMAP1510 – 168 MHz ARM925T (TI-enhanced) + C55x DSP
* OMAP161x – 204 MHz ARM926EJ-S + C55x DSP, 130 nm technology
* OMAP162x – 204 MHz ARM926EJ-S + C55x DSP + 2 MB internal SRAM, 130 nm technology
* OMAP171x – 220 MHz ARM926EJ-S + C55x DSP, low-voltage 90 nm technology
* OMAP5910 – catalog availability version of OMAP 1510
* OMAP5912 – catalog availability version of OMAP1621 (or OMAP1611b in older versions)

==== OMAP 2 ====
These parts were only marketed to handset vendors. Products using these include both Internet tablets and mobile phones:
* OMAP2431 – 330 MHz ARM1136 + 220 MHz C64x DSP
* OMAP2430 – 330 MHz ARM1136 + 220 MHz C64x DSP + PowerVR MBX lite GPU, 90 nm technology
* OMAP2420 – 330 MHz ARM1136 + 220 MHz C55x DSP + PowerVR MBX GPU, 90 nm technology

==== OMAP 3 ====
The 3rd generation OMAP, the OMAP 3 is broken into 3 distinct groups: the OMAP34x, the OMAP35x, and the OMAP36x. OMAP34x and OMAP36x are distributed directly to large handset (such as cell phone) manufacturers. OMAP35x is a variant of OMAP34x intended for catalog distribution channels. The OMAP36x is a 45 nm version of the 65 nm OMAP34x with higher clock speed.

The OMAP 3611 found in devices like the Bookeen&#x27;s Cybook Odyssey is a licensed crippled version of the OMAP 3621, both are the same silicon (as marking are the same) but officially the 3611 was sold to be only able to drive e-Ink screen and does not have access to IVA &amp; DSP.

The video technology in the higher end OMAP 3 parts is derived in part from the DaVinci product line, which first packaged higher end C64x+ DSPs and image processing controllers with ARM9 processors last seen in the older OMAP 1 generation or ARM Cortex-A8.

Not highlighted in the list below is that each OMAP 3 SoC has an &quot;Image, Video, Audio&quot; (IVA2) accelerator. These units do not all have the same capabilities. Most devices support 12 megapixel camera images, though some support 5 or 3 megapixels. Some support HD imaging.

==== OMAP 4 ====

The OMAP 4 line consists of the OMAP 4430, OMAP 4460 (formerly named 4440), and OMAP 4470. The 4th generation OMAPs have a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU with two ARM Cortex-M3 cores, as part of the &quot;Ducati&quot; sub-system for off-loading low-level tasks. The OMAP 4430 was the SoC used in Google Glass.

OMAP 4 uses ARM Cortex-A9&#x27;s with ARM&#x27;s SIMD engine (Media Processing Engine, aka NEON) which in some cases may have a significant performance advantage over Nvidia Tegra 2&#x27;s ARM Cortex-A9s with non-vector floating point units. It also uses a dual-channel LPDDR2 memory controller compared to Nvidia Tegra 2&#x27;s single-channel memory controller.

All OMAP 4 processors come with an IVA3 multimedia hardware accelerator with a programmable DSP that enables 1080p Full HD and multi-standard video encoding and decoding.

The 4430 and 4460 use a PowerVR SGX540 graphics processing unit (GPU). The 4430&#x27;s GPU runs at a clock frequency of 304 Mhz, and the 4460&#x27;s GPU runs at 384 MHz.

The 4470 has a PowerVR SGX544 GPU that supports DirectX 9 that enables it for use in Windows 8. It also has a dedicated 2D graphics core for increased power efficiency up to 50-90%.

==== OMAP 5 ====
The 5th generation OMAP, OMAP 5 SoC uses a dual-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU with two additional Cortex-M4 cores to offload the A15s in less computationally intensive tasks to increase power efficiency, two PowerVR SGX544MP graphics cores and a dedicated TI 2D BitBlt graphics accelerator, a multi-pipe display sub-system and a signal processor. They respectively support 24 and 20 megapixel cameras for front and rear 3D HD video recording. The chip also supports up to 8 GB of dual channel LPDDR2/DDR3 memory, output to four HD 3D displays and 3D HDMI 1.4 video output. OMAP 5 also includes three USB 2.0 ports, one lowspeed USB 3.0 OTG port and a SATA 2.0 controller.

=== Basic multimedia applications processors ===

These are marketed only to handset manufacturers. They are intended to be highly integrated, low cost chips for consumer products. The OMAP-DM series are intended to be used as digital media coprocessors for mobile devices with high megapixel digital still and video cameras. These OMAP-DM chips incorporate both an ARM processor and an Image Signal Processor (ISP) to accelerate processing of camera images.

* OMAP310 – ARM925T 
* OMAP331 – ARM926
* OMAP-DM270 – ARM7 + C54x DSP
* OMAP-DM299 – ARM7 + Image Signal Processor (ISP) + stacked mDDR SDRAM
* OMAP-DM500 – ARM7 + ISP + stacked mDDR SDRAM
* OMAP-DM510 – ARM926 + ISP + 128 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM
* OMAP-DM515 – ARM926 + ISP + 256 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM
* OMAP-DM525 – ARM926 + ISP + 256 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM

=== Integrated modem and applications processors ===

These are marketed only to handset manufacturers. Many of the newer versions are highly integrated for use in very low cost cell phones.
* OMAPV1035 – single-chip EDGE (was discontinued in 2009 as TI announced baseband chipset market withdrawal).
* OMAPV1030 – EDGE digital baseband
* OMAP850 – 200 MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + stacked EDGE co-processor
* OMAP750 – 200 MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + DDR Memory support
* OMAP733 – 200 MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + stacked SDRAM
* OMAP730 – 200 MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + SDRAM Memory support
* OMAP710 – 133 MHz ARM925 + GSM/GPRS digital baseband

=== OMAP L-1x ===
The OMAP L-1x parts are marketed only through catalog channels, and have a different technological heritage than the other OMAP parts. Rather than deriving directly from cell phone product lines, they grew from the video-oriented DaVinci product line by removing the video-specific features while using upgraded DaVinci peripherals. A notable feature is use of a &quot;floating point&quot; DSP, instead of the more customary fixed point one.

The Hawkboard uses the OMAP-L138
* OMAP-L137 – 300 MHz ARM926EJ-S + C674x floating point DSP
* OMAP-L138 – 300 MHz ARM926EJ-S + C674x floating point DSP

== Products using OMAP processors ==
Many mobile phones released during early 21st century have used OMAP SoCs, including the Nokia 3230, N9, N90, N91, N92, N95, N82, E61, E62, E63 and E90 mobile phones, as well as the Nokia 770, N800, N810 and N900 Internet tablets, Motorola Droid, Droid X, and Droid 2, and some early Samsung Galaxy devices, like Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and Galaxy S II variant GT-I9100G.

The OMAP3430 is used in the Palm Pre, Pandora, and Touch Book. Other devices that use OMAP processors include Sony Ericsson&#x27;s Satio (Idou) and Vivaz, most Samsung phones running Symbian (including Omnia HD), the Nook Color, some Archos tablets (such as Archos 80 gen 9 and Archos 101 gen 9), Kindle Fire HD, Blackberry Playbook, Kobo Arc, and B&amp;N Nook HD.

Some all-in-one smart displays use OMAP 4 SoCs, including the Viewsonic VSD220, which uses an OMAP 4430.

OMAP SoCs are also used as the basis for a number of hobbyist, prototyping and evaluation boards, such as the BeagleBoard, PandaBoard, OMAP3 Board, Gumstix and Presonus digital mixing boards

Motorola MOTOTRBO 2. generation radios use the OMAP-L132 or OMAP-L138 secure CPU.

<text>Letters on the English (or Letters Concerning the English Nation; French: &quot;Lettres philosophiques&quot;) are a series of essays written by Voltaire based on his experiences living in Great Britain between 1726 and 1729. The book was published first in English in 1733 and then in French the following year, where it was seen as an attack on the French system of government and was rapidly suppressed.

A revised edition appeared in English in 1778 as &quot;Lettres philosophiques sur les Anglais&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Letters on the English&quot;). Most modern English editions are based on the one from 1734 and typically use the title &quot;Philosophical Letters&quot;, a direct translation of that version&#x27;s title.

In some ways, the book can be compared with &quot;Democracy in America&quot; by Alexis de Tocqueville, in how it flatteringly explains a nation to itself from the perspective of an outsider, as Voltaire&#x27;s depictions of aspects of English culture, society and government are often given favourable treatment in comparison to their French equivalents.

==Summary==

===Religion===
Voltaire first addresses religion in Letters 1–7. He specifically talks about Quakers (1–4), Anglicans (5), Presbyterians (6) and Socinians (7).
In the Letters 1–4, Voltaire describes the Quakers, their customs, their beliefs, and their history. He appreciates the simplicity of their rituals. In particular, he praises their lack of baptism (&quot;we are not of opinion that the sprinkling water on a child&#x27;s head makes him a Christian&quot;), the lack of communion (&quot;&#x27;How! no communion?&#x27; said I. &#x27;Only that spiritual one&#x27;, replied he, &#x27;of hearts&#x27;&quot;), and the lack of priests (&quot;&#x27;You have, then, no priests?&#x27;, said I to him. &#x27;No, no, friend&#x27;, replies the Quaker, &#x27;to our great happiness&#x27;&quot;), but still expresses concern regarding the manipulative nature of organized religion.

Letter 5 is devoted to the Anglican religion, which Voltaire compares favourably to Catholicism (&quot;With regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more regular than those of France&quot;), but he criticizes the ways in which it has stayed true to the Catholic rituals, in particular (&quot;The English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish ceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous attention, their tithes&quot;).

In Letter 6, Voltaire attacks the Presbyterians, whom he sees as intolerant (&quot;[The Presbyterian] affects a serious gait, puts on a sour look, wears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a very short coat, preaches through the nose, and gives the name of the whore of Babylon to all churches where the ministers are so fortunate as to enjoy an annual revenue of five or six thousand pounds, and where the people are weak enough to suffer this, and to give them the titles of my lord, your lordship, or your eminence&quot;) and overly strict (&quot;No operas, plays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and even cards are so expressly forbidden that none but persons of quality, and those we call the genteel, play on that day; the rest of the nation go either to church, to the tavern, or to see their mistresses&quot;).

Finally, in the Letter 7, he talks about the &quot;Socinians&quot;, whose belief system is somewhat related to Voltaire&#x27;s own deist viewpoint. Voltaire argues that while this sect includes some of the day&#x27;s most important thinkers (including Newton and Locke), this is not enough to persuade the common man that it is logical. According to Voltaire, men prefer to follow the teachings of &quot;wretched authors&quot; such as Martin Luther, John Calvin or Huldrych Zwingli.

===Politics===
In Letters 8 and 9, Voltaire discusses the English political system.

Letter 8 talks about the British parliament, which he compares to both Rome and France. In terms of Rome, Voltaire deprecates the fact that England has entered wars on account of religion (whereas Rome did not), but he praises England for serving liberty rather than tyranny (as in Rome). In terms of France, Voltaire responds to French criticism concerning the regicide of Charles I by highlighting the British judicial process as opposed to the outright murders of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII or Henry III of France, or the multiple attempts on the life of Henry IV of France.

In Letter 9, Voltaire gives a brief history of the Magna Carta, talks about the equal dispensing of justice, and the levying of taxes.

===Trade and commerce===
In Letter 10, Voltaire praises the English trade system, its benefits, and what it brings to the English (from 1707, British) nation. According to Voltaire, trade greatly contributed to the liberty of the English people, and this liberty in turn contributed to the expansion of commerce. It is trade as well that gave England its naval riches and power. In addition, Voltaire takes the opportunity to satirize the German and French nobles who ignore this type of enterprise. For Voltaire, nobles are less important than the businessman who &quot;contributes to the felicity of the world&quot;.

===Medicine===
In Letter 11, Voltaire argues in favour for the English practice of inoculation, which was widely mistrusted and condemned in continental Europe. This letter is probably in response to a 1723 small pox epidemic in Paris that killed 20,000 people.

===Famous Britons===
Letter 12 speaks of Francis Bacon, author of &quot;Novum Organum&quot; and father of experimental philosophy.

Letter 13 is about John Locke and his theories on the immortality of the soul.

Letter 14 compares British philosopher Isaac Newton to French philosopher René Descartes. Upon his death in 1727, Newton was compared to Descartes in a eulogy performed by French philosopher Fontenelle. While the British did not appreciate this comparison, Voltaire argues that Descartes, too, was a great philosopher and mathematician.

Letter 15 focuses on Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. Letter 16 talks about Newton&#x27;s work with optics. Letter 17 discusses Newton&#x27;s work with geometry and his theories on the chronology of history.

===Art===
In Letter 18, Voltaire talks about British tragedy, specifically in the hands of William Shakespeare. Voltaire presents his readers with the famous &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy in &quot;Hamlet&quot; along with a translation into French rhyming verse. He also cites a passage from John Dryden and gives a translation.

In Letter 19, Voltaire addresses British comedy, citing William Wycherley, John Vanbrugh and William Congreve.

Letter 20 speaks briefly of the &quot;belles lettres&quot; of the nobility, including the Earl of Rochester and Edmund Waller.

Letter 22 references the poetry of Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope.

In Letter 23, Voltaire argues that the British honour their Men of Letters far better than the French in terms of money and veneration.

The last letter, Letter 24, discusses the Royal Society of London, which he compares unfavourably to the Académie Française.

==Letter XXV==

===Philosophy===
In the letter 25, which was not included with the original twenty-four, Voltaire criticizes certain ideas of Blaise Pascal by taking citations from his &quot;Pensées&quot; and giving his own opinion on the same subject. The most important difference between the two philosophers is in their conception of man. Pascal insists on the miserable aspect of man who must fill the emptiness of his life with amusements, while Voltaire accepts the optimistic Enlightenment view.

<doc id="1249345" wikidata="Q1322008" url="?curid=1249345" title="2001 Major League Soccer season">
<text>The 2001 Major League Soccer season was the sixth season of Major League Soccer. It was also the 89th season of FIFA-sanctioned soccer in the United States, and the 23rd with a national first-division league.

The season was shortened due to the September 11 attacks, with the final weeks&#x27; regular season matches being canceled. Due to the different number of games played, playoff ordering was determined by points per game, instead of total points.

The regular season began on April 7, and concluded prematurely on September 9. The 2001 MLS Cup Playoffs began on September 20, and concluded with MLS Cup 2001 on October 21. The Miami Fusion won their first Supporters&#x27; Shield and the San Jose Earthquakes defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy in the final to win their first MLS Cup.

==Overview==
===Season format===
The season began on April 7 and concluded with MLS Cup on October 21. The 12 teams were split into three divisions. Each team was to play 28 games that were evenly divided between home and away. Each team would play every other team in their division four times, for a total of 12 games. The remaining schedule consisted of three games against four select opponents in one of the other divisions, and two games against the remaining four teams.

The eight teams with the most points per game qualified for the MLS Cup Playoffs. The quarterfinals and semifinals were played as a best-of-three series, and the winners advanced to MLS Cup. In all rounds, draws were broken by penalty shootout if necessary. The away goals rule was not used in any round.

The team with the most points in the regular season was awarded the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield. The winner of MLS Cup, and the runner-up, qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

<text>Cinema Paradiso (, , literally &quot;New Paradise Cinema&quot;) is a 1988 coming-of-age dramedy film written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. 

Set in a small Sicilian town, the film centres on the friendship between a young boy and an aging projectionist who works at the titular movie theatre. This Italian-French co-production stars Philippe Noiret, Jacques Perrin, Leopoldo Trieste, Marco Leonardi, Agnese Nano and Salvatore Cascio. The film score was composed by Ennio Morricone and his son, Andrea, marking the beginning of a collaboration between Tornatore and Morricone that lasted until Morricone&#x27;s death in 2020.

Credited with revitalizing Italy&#x27;s film industry, &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; has been cited as one of the greatest films of all time, and a world cinema classic. The ending is considered among the greatest endings in movie history. It was a commercial success, and won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Prix. It was nominated for 11 BAFTA Awards and won five; including Best Actor for Philippe Noiret, Best Supporting Actor for Salvatore Cascio, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Foreign Language Film, a record for a foreign language feature until it was broken by &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; in 2023.

==Plot==
In 1988 Rome, Salvatore Di Vita, a famous film director, returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily, in thirty years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo was, Salvatore is not able to fall asleep and flashes back to his childhood.

A few years after World War II, eight-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the middle-aged projectionist, Alfredo, who often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing because there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing scenes with romantic kisses or embraces. The local priest, the owner of the cinema, had ordered these sections to be censored, and the deleted scenes are cut from the film reels by Alfredo and piled on the projection room floor, where Alfredo keeps them until he can splice them back in for the film to be sent to the next town.

Alfredo eventually teaches Salvatore how to operate the film projector. One day, Cinema Paradiso catches fire as Alfredo is projecting &quot;The Firemen of Viggiù&quot; after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo&#x27;s life, but not before a reel of nitrate film explodes in Alfredo&#x27;s face, leaving him permanently blind. The movie house is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio Spaccafico, using his winnings from a football lottery. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as only he knows how to run the machines.

About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the &quot;Nuovo Cinema Paradiso&quot;. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help – advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with filming, using a home movie camera; doing this he has met, and captured on film, a girl named Elena Mendola, daughter of a wealthy banker, and has fallen in love with her. Salvatore woos – and wins – Elena&#x27;s heart, only to lose her due to her father&#x27;s disapproval.

As Elena and her family move away, Salvatore leaves town for compulsory military service. His attempts to write to Elena are fruitless; his letters are returned as undeliverable. Upon his return from the military, Alfredo urges Salvatore to leave Giancaldo permanently, counseling that the town is too small for Salvatore to ever find his dreams. Moreover, the old man tells him, once Salvatore leaves, he must pursue his destiny wholeheartedly, never looking back and never returning, even to visit; he must never give in to nostalgia or even write or think about them. They tearfully embrace, and Salvatore leaves to pursue his future as a filmmaker.

Back in the present, Salvatore realizes that he is very satisfied with his life from a professional point of view but not from a personal one, so decides to return home to attend Alfredo&#x27;s funeral. Though the town has changed greatly, he now understands why Alfredo thought it was important that he leave. Alfredo&#x27;s widow tells him that the old man followed Salvatore&#x27;s successes with pride and he left him something: an unlabeled film reel and the old stool that Salvatore once stood on to operate the projector. Salvatore learns that Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished to make way for a parking lot. At the funeral, he recognizes the faces of many people who attended the cinema when he was the projectionist.

Salvatore returns to Rome where he watches Alfredo&#x27;s reel and discovers that it comprises all the romantic scenes that the priest had ordered Alfredo to cut from the movies; Alfredo had spliced every kiss together to form a single reel – Toto comes to peace with his past, smiling with tears in his eyes.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; was shot in director Tornatore&#x27;s hometown Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. The town square in the film is Piazza Umberto I in the village of Palazzo Adriano, about 30 miles south of Palermo. The ‘Paradiso’ cinema was built here, at Via Nino Bixio, overlooking the octagonal Baroque fountain, which dates from 1608.

Told largely in flashback of a successful film director Salvatore to his childhood years, it also tells the story of the return to his native Sicilian village for the funeral of his old friend Alfredo, the projectionist at the local &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;. Ultimately, Alfredo serves as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process.

Seen as an example of &quot;nostalgic postmodernism&quot;, the film intertwines sentimentality with comedy, and nostalgia with pragmaticism. It explores issues of youth, coming of age, and reflections (in adulthood) about the past. The imagery in the scenes can be said to reflect Salvatore&#x27;s idealised memories of his childhood. &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; is also a celebration of films; as a projectionist, young Salvatore (a.k.a. Totò) develops a passion for films that shapes his life path in adulthood.

==Releases==
The film exists in multiple versions. It was originally released in Italy at 155 minutes, but poor box office performance in its native country led to its being shortened to 124 minutes for international release; in that form it was successful. This international version won the Special Jury Prize at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and the 1989 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. In 2002, the director&#x27;s cut 173-minute version was released (known in the U.S. as Cinema Paradiso: The New Version), although this was the original version, used at the film&#x27;s premiere at the Europa Cinema Festival, 29 September 1988, in Bari.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
In the 173-minute version of the film, after the funeral, Salvatore notices an adolescent girl who resembles the teenage Elena. He follows as she rides her scooter to her home, which allows Salvatore to contact his long-lost love Elena, who is revealed to be the girl&#x27;s mother. Salvatore calls her in hopes of rekindling their romance; she initially rejects him, but later reconsiders and goes to see Salvatore, who was contemplating his rejection at a favorite location from their early years. Their meeting ultimately leads to a lovemaking session in her car. He learns that she had married an acquaintance from his school years, who became a local politician of modest means. Afterwards, feeling cheated, he strives to rekindle their romance, and while she clearly wishes it were possible, she rejects his entreaties, choosing to remain with her family and leave their romance in the past.

During their evening together, a frustrated Salvatore asks Elena why she never contacted him or left word of where her family was moving to. He learns that the reason they lost touch was because Alfredo asked her not to see him again, fearing that Salvatore&#x27;s romantic fulfillment would only destroy what Alfredo sees as Salvatore&#x27;s destiny – to be successful in the cinema world. Alfredo tried to convince her that if she loved Salvatore, she should leave him for his own good. Elena explains to Salvatore that, against Alfredo&#x27;s instruction, she had secretly left a note with an address where she could be reached and a promise of undying love and loyalty. Salvatore realizes that he never found that note, and thus lost his true love for more than thirty years. The next morning, Salvatore returns to the decaying Cinema Paradiso and frantically searches through the piles of old film invoices pinned to the wall of the projection booth. There, on the reverse side of one of the dockets, he finds the handwritten note Elena had left thirty years earlier.

The film ends with Salvatore returning to Rome and, with teary eyes, viewing the film reel that Alfredo left.

==Home media==
A special edition of &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment on 4 September 2006.

An Academy Award edition of &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment on 1 February 2009.

On 1 July 2011, Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray. Arrow released a remastered special edition Blu-ray of the film, with both theatrical and extended cuts, in 2017.

In June 2020, Arrow Films announced a 4K UHD Blu-ray release with both of the aforementioned cuts due for September of that year, with the 124-minute theatrical cut as a 4K UHD presentation, the 174-minute Director’s Cut as a Blu-ray presentation.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; was a box-office success. 

The film was released twice in Italy before its Cannes win and flopped at the box office both times. After the Cannes win it was re-released and performed steadily however, following its Academy Award success, it was released again and performed better, grossing $5.3 million in Italy. In France, the film ran for over a year, grossing over $19 million. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $12.3 million.
===Critical response===
&quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, making Tornatore internationally known, and is regarded by many as a classic. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 86 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; is a life-affirming ode to the power of youth, nostalgia, and the the movies themselves.&quot; The film holds a score of 80 based on 21 reviews on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It is particularly renowned for the &#x27;kissing scenes&#x27; montage at the film&#x27;s end. Winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1989, the film is often credited with reviving Italy&#x27;s film industry, which later produced &quot;Mediterraneo&quot; and &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;. 

Film critic Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars out of four and four stars out of four for the extended version, declaring &quot;Still, I&#x27;m happy to have seen it--not as an alternate version, but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes.&quot; Oddly, despite giving a higher rating to the extended version, Ebert maintained that the theatrical version was superior: &quot;I must confess that the shorter version of Cinema Paradiso is a better film than the longer.&quot;

The film was ranked #27 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

==In popular culture==
The famed &quot;kissing scene&quot; montage at the end of the film was used in &quot;Stealing First Base&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that aired on 21 March 2010, during its twenty-first season. The scene used Morricone&#x27;s &quot;Love Theme&quot; and included animated clips of famous movie kisses, including scenes used in &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; as well as contemporary films not shown in the original film. American progressive metal band Dream Theater 1992 album &quot;Images and Words&quot;&#x27; song &quot;Take the Time&quot; features in the lyrics the sentence spoken by Alfredo after the fire, &quot;&quot;ora che ho perso la vista, ci vedo di più&quot;! (I can see much clearer now I&#x27;m blind)&quot;.

<doc id="1249350" wikidata="Q5157616" url="?curid=1249350" title="Computers and writing">
<text>Computers and writing is a sub-field of college English studies about how computers and digital technologies affect literacy and the writing process. The range of inquiry in this field is broad including discussions on ethics when using computers in writing programs, how discourse can be produced through technologies, software development, and computer-aided literacy instruction. Some topics include hypertext theory, visual rhetoric, multimedia authoring, distance learning, digital rhetoric, usability studies, the patterns of online communities, how various media change reading and writing practices, textual conventions, and genres. Other topics examine social or critical issues in computer technology and literacy, such as the issues of the &quot;digital divide&quot;, equitable access to computer-writing resources, and critical technological literacies. Many studies by scientists have shown that writing on computer is better than writing in a book

&quot;Computers and Writing&quot; is also the name of an academic conference (see below).

==The Field==
This interdisciplinary field has grown out of rhetoric and composition studies. Members do scholarly work and teach in allied and diverse areas as technical and professional communication, linguistics, sociology, and law. Important journals supporting this field are &quot;Computers &amp; Composition&quot;, &quot;Computers &amp; Composition Online&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The professional organization Conference on College Composition and Communication has a committee, known as the 7Cs committee (CCCC Committee on Computers in Composition and Communication), that selects onsite and online hosts for the Computers &amp; Writing conference and coordinates the &quot;Technology Innovator Award&quot; presented at that annual conference.

== Conference and Conference History ==
The conference &quot;Computers and Writing&quot; was established in 1982 in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Donald Ross and Lillian Bridwell. The conference was informal at first, but has grown from a grassroots organized conference to an established, mainstream conference that examines the ways in which computers change writing practice and pedagogy. In earlier conferences, the scholarship presented often explored how computers influenced individual writers, but during the late 1980s and 1990s, scholarship shifted to hypertext and hypermedia, and the social nature of computer mediated writing. The conference initially presented original or &quot;homemade&quot; software design associated with word processing and editing, but eventually switched to commercial software as commercial software became more common for both individual students and educational institutions.

The conference has a history of technological optimism, and the scholarship presented is optimistic regarding technology&#x27;s influence on writing. The conference also examines and voices fears and concerns related to computer technology. Some of these fears are related to institutional policies and control as well as the fear of being overwhelmed by the constant march of technological innovation. The conference has also explored how computer-mediated writing can be used in socially responsible ways, as is evident by the feminist roots of the conference and subfield. The conference&#x27;s feminist roots are evident in its support of minority scholars and scholarship. Awards such as the Hawisher and Selfe Caring for the Future Scholarship provide opportunities for new presenters in Computers and Writing related fields to attend the conference. This scholarship is preferably awarded to minority scholars who are involved in the field.

While the conference was originally more focused on software and hardware decisions and use, the conference has become more concerned with the theoretical application of computers in writing pedagogy and practice. This attention to theory mirrors a shift to embrace multimodal compositions as texts and interdisciplinary growth as the conference became more mainstream and established in the 1990s and early 2000s.

The conference has been held annually since 1988, which is the year that the CCCC Committee on Computers established a subcommittee to support the Computers and Writing Conference. While the journal &quot;Computers and Composition&quot;, founded by Cynthia Selfe and Kate Kiefer in 1983, is not officially connected to the Computers and Writing Conference, both began around the same time and explore the subfield within the larger fields of composition studies and rhetoric.

==Pedagogy==
Computers and writing pedagogy teach students practical applications and implications of writing by exploring complex concepts such as visual rhetoric, issues of access, and the social implications of online writing. Scholars analyze how the computer becomes an environment for facilitated writing and communication. The production and consumption of digital, multimodal, and new media texts advances the field&#x27;s range of study and research. The integration of computers into writing instruction has significantly improved student’s quality of writing by allowing for immediate feedback and periodic revision, resulting in enhanced writing capabilities. The majority of computers and writing scholars agree that engaging students in the production of such multimodal/digital texts is crucial to the learning process in our digitally infused moment. Technological advancements have facilitated the development of writing and digital literacy amongst students across all education levels. Consequently, theoretical frameworks designed for online writing instruction play a pivotal role in the advancement of pedagogy, encouraging the development of flexible learning environments. 

During the 1960s and 1970s, which was also known as the &quot;Birth of Composition,&quot; computer-assisted instruction was used to observe students and provided instant positive, negative, or constructive feedback. How computers and digital technologies would impact writers&#x27; efficiency and quality of work was being determined. Initial debate came from how best to balance creativity and technical construction in writing. Many teachers thought that the technology programs offered needed improvement because they did not allow for the creative expression of the students, acting only as an evaluator, reader, and feedback agent. Now the programs require multimodality, creativity, and technical complexity. The problems the students face in these programs now require much more comprehensive thinking and creativity to the point that it is difficult to still call the subject &quot;writing&quot; because the students are required to know much more.

Computers and writing pedagogies must be dynamic and adaptable to how technology, media, and the sociopolitical spaces operate in a constant state of flux. Emerging forms of pedagogies address &quot;Digital Activism&quot; and the use of social media on political communication and advocacy. Quality interaction in blended and online writing classes is important. It should emphasize pedagogical methods that foster thoughtful communication between instructors and students and facilitate the enhancement of writing skills. 

Computers and digital media offer innovative ways to engage rhetorically with one another. Studying how students develop their digital literacy through their connecting their previous interactions with technologies to new forms by means of metaphors and mental models. Teaching theoretical composing concepts through scaffolding can build students&#x27; digital literacy both with current and future technologies and programs. These skills advance critical media awareness when working with digital media.

==Writing in the age of communication technology==
In the age of communication technology, amateurs and experts collaborate to create, sustain and develop virtual communities based on what James Paul Gee and Elisabeth Hayes have called &quot;passionate affinity spaces&quot;, or communities organized around &quot;a shared endeavor, interest, or passion&quot;. Technology, specifically blogs, can be a way to build learning communities and help students learn to write authentically for and respond to various audiences by making their writing public. On the virtual playing field, knowledge and talent matter more than degrees and professional memberships, so these spaces offer students a new learning environment and space to collaborate on the production and distribution of knowledge. Online platforms can reshape traditional pedagogies by encouraging flexibility and personal creativity. Also, digital tools improve educational quality by promoting a collaborative environment that stimulates critical thinking, preparing students for the pedagogical shifts in writing education. 

Aligning with the notion of &quot;affinity space&quot;, composition scholars have coined the term &quot;cultural ecology&quot; to examine the complex social and cultural contexts that shape the development of technological literacy. Drawing from the literacy narratives of two participants, Hawisher, Selfe, Moraski, and Pearson theorized five themes emergent from the cultural ecology of literacy, namely the &quot;cultural, material, educational, and familial contexts&quot; that shape and are shaped by literacy development. The five themes of cultural ecology emphasize that technological literacy goes through life spans, that literacy provides the medium for people to exert their agency, that literacy occurs and develops both within and outside of school contexts, that the conditions of access influence people&#x27;s literacy development, and that literacy practices and values transmit via family units. Kristine Blair pointed to the positive impacts of cultural conflicts in constructing online discourses and political discussions, while at the same time warning that students may not transform exposure to the conflicts. Also looming behind the issue of culture in computer and writing is the digital divide. Cynthia Selfe showed that unequal access to technological literacy is situated in unequal social, cultural, economic, and political situations. As Selfe wrote, &quot;computers continue to be distributed along the related axes of race and socioeconomic status and this distribution continues to ongoing patterns of racism and to the continuation of poverty.&quot; To address the digital divide, Selfe called upon educators and compositionists to rethink computer literacy as a political act that requires paying critical attention to inequality issues and acting politically in specific disciplinary contexts.

<text>The APE(X)C, or All Purpose Electronic (X) Computer series was designed by Andrew Donald Booth at Birkbeck College, London in the early 1950s. His work on the APE(X)C series was sponsored by the British Rayon Research Association. Although the naming conventions are slightly unclear, it seems the first model belonged to the BRRA. According to Booth, the X stood for X-company.

One of the series was also known as the APE(X)C or All Purpose Electronic X-Ray Computer and was sited at Birkbeck.

==Background==
From 1943 on, Booth started working on the determination of crystal structures using X-ray diffraction data. The computations involved were extremely tedious and there was ample incentive for automating the process. He developed an analogue computer to compute the reciprocal spacings of the diffraction pattern. 

In 1947, along with his collaborator and future spouse Kathleen Britten, he spent a few months with von Neumann&#x27;s team, which was the leading edge in computer research at the time.

==ARC and SEC==
Booth designed an electromechanical computer, the ARC (Automatic Relay Computer), in the late 1940s (1947-1948). Later on, they built an experimental electronic computer named SEC (Simple Electronic Computer, designed around 1948-1949) - and finally, the APE(X)C (All-Purpose Electronic Computer) series. 

The computers were programmed by Kathleen.

==The APE(X) C series==
The APE(X)C series included the following machines:
* APE(X)C: Birkbeck College, London, first time operated in May 1952, ready for use at the end of 1953
* APE(N)C: Board of Mathematical Machines, Oslo (&#x27;N&#x27; likely stands for &#x27;Norway&#x27;), also known as NUSSE
* APE(H)C: British Tabulating Machine Company (It is unclear what &#x27;H&#x27; stands for - perhaps &#x27;Hollerith&#x27; as the company sold Hollerith Unit record equipment
* APE(R)C: British Rayon Research Association (&#x27;R&#x27; stands for &#x27;Rayon&#x27;), ready for use in June 1952
* UCC: University College, London (circa January 1956)
* MAC or MAGIC (Magnetic Automatic Calculator): &quot;built by Wharf Engineering Laboratories&quot; (February 1955)
* The HEC (Hollerith Electronic Computer), built by the British Tabulating Machine Company (later to become International Computers and Tabulators (ICT), then International Computers Limited (ICL)), a commercial machine sold in several models and later known as the ICT200 series. There were likely the derivatives HEC 1, HEC 2, HEC 2M - M for &#x27;marketable&#x27; denoting the machine&#x27;s orientation toward commercial rather than scientific customers, and HEC 4 (before 1955)

Only one of each of these machines was built, with the exception of HEC (and possibly MAC) which were commercial machines produced in quite large numbers for the time, around 150. They were similar in design, with various small differences, mostly in I/O equipment. The APEHC was a punched card machine while the APEXC, APERC and APENC were teletypers (keyboard and printer, plus paper tape reader and puncher). Also, the UCC had 8k words of storage, instead of 1k word for other machines, and the MAC used germanium diodes in replacement of many valves.

==British Tabulating Machine Company machines==
In March 1951, the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) sent a team to Andrew Booth&#x27;s workshop. They then used his design to create the Hollerith Electronic Computer 1 (HEC 1) before the end of 1951. The computer was a direct copy of Andrew Booth&#x27;s circuits with extra Input/output interfaces. The HEC 2 was the HEC 1 with smarter metal casings and was built for the Business Efficiency Exhibition in 1953. A slightly modified version of the HEC 2 was then marketed as HEC2M and 8 were sold. The HEC2M was succeeded by the HEC4. Around 100 HEC4s were sold in the late 1950s.

The HEC used standard punched cards; the HEC 4 had a printer, too, and it featured several instructions (such as divide) and registers not found on the APEXC.

==Technical description==
An emulator for the APEXC series has been developed by MESS. They describe its functioning as follows:

The APEXC is an incredibly simple machine.

Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2&#x27;s complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, for a total of 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.

One oddity is that there is no program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.

The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.

Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.

The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.

Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. 

Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.

Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer (&#x27;teletyper&#x27;) unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (&lt;-&gt; bits), which makes 32 different values).

<text>Popular socialism or people&#x27;s socialism ([[Danish language|Danish]]: &quot;Folkesocialisme&quot;) is a distinct socialist current from the Nordic countries.

In that context the term can be said to represent a distinct ideological tendency, originating from Aksel Larsen&#x27;s split from the Communist Party of Denmark in 1956. Larsen founded the Socialist People&#x27;s Party (SF), which placed itself between communism and social democracy. In Norway a similar party, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party was formed by an anti-NATO/anti-European Economic Community-split from the Labour Party and later became the backbone of Socialist Left Party (SV). Today, both the Danish SF and the Norwegian SV identify their ideological base as &#x27;popular socialism&#x27;. In Sweden the term has sometimes been used and there were at one point discussions within the rightist section of the Left Party on forming a political project with the Danish SF as model, but the split was eventually avoided.

Inspired by green politics and democratic socialism, popular socialism places emphasis on grassroots democracy, social justice, and environmentalism. Popular socialist parties participate in democratic elections to gain clout and influence policy, but do not consider the power of government as their primary goal, preferring to work within participatory systems on a local level.

<text>Enets is a Samoyedic language of Northern Siberia spoken on the Lower Yenisei within the boundaries of the Taimyr Municipality District, a subdivision of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russian Federation. Enets belongs to the Northern branch of the Samoyedic languages, in turn a branch of the Uralic language family. 

==Status==
In 2010 about 40 people claimed to be native Enets speakers, while in 2020, 69 people claimed to speak Enets natively, while 97 people claimed to know Enets in total.

Older generation still speaks their language, but education is in Russian and very little of Enets language is taught and the language is almost unused in everyday life.

== Dialects ==
There are two distinct dialects, and , which may be considered separate languages.

Tundra Enets is the smaller of the two Enets dialects. In the winter of 2006/2007, approximately 35 people spoke it (6 in Dudinka, 20 in and 10 in Tukhard, the youngest of whom was born in 1962 and the oldest in 1945). Many of these speakers are trilingual, with competence in Forest Enets, Tundra Nenets and Russian, preferring to speak Tundra Nenets.

The two dialects differ both in phonology and in lexicon. Additional variation was found in early Enets records from the 17th to 19th centuries, though all these varieties can be assigned as either Tundra Enets or Forest Enets.

Phonological differences:
* In some words, Forest Enets corresponds to Tundra Enets (from Proto-Samoyedic *ms, *ns, *rs and *rkʲ).
** Forest — Tundra &#x27;wind&#x27; (from *merse &lt; *märkʲä);
** Forest — Tundra &#x27;meat&#x27; (from *ʊnsa &lt; *əmså);
** Forest — Tundra &#x27;snow&#x27;;
** Forest — Tundra &#x27;pike&#x27;;
** Forest — Tundra &#x27;grandmother&#x27;;
* In some words, Forest Enets word-initial corresponds to Tundra Enets (from Proto-Samoyedic *a- &gt; *ä-).
* Certain vowel + glide sequences of Proto-Samoyedic have different reflexes in Forest Enets and Tundra Enets.
* Forest Enets word-initial corresponds to Tundra Enets .

Lexical differences:
* Forest — Tundra &#x27;head&#x27;
* Forest — Tundra &#x27;word&#x27;
* Forest — Tundra &#x27;tobacco&#x27;
* Forest — Tundra &#x27;what&#x27;

== Phonology ==
The following phoneme inventories are combined from all of the different dialects of the Enets languages. Uralicist transcription, often used in literature on Enets, is given below the IPA transcription.

=== Vowels ===
Vowel length is indicated by a macron, e.g. &quot;ē&quot; .

=== Consonants ===
* There is partial or complete vowel reduction in the middle and at the end of a word
* Consonants preceding &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; become palatalized

=== Stress ===
The type of stress in Enets is quantitative. Stressed vowels are pronounced relatively longer than unstressed vowels. Based on the available data, the stress is not (as a rule) used as a feature for distinguishing the meaning. The stress in a word usually falls on the first vowel. The primary stress usually falls on the first syllable and is accompanied by a secondary stress, which falls on the third and the fifth syllable. Sometimes the stress distinguishes the meaning, e.g. in mo·di (&#x27;I&#x27;) vs. modi· (&#x27;shoulder&#x27;). (The primary stress is marked by ·).

== Orthography ==
Enets is written using the Cyrillic alphabet, though it includes the letters &quot;ԑ&quot;, &quot;ӈ&quot;, and &quot;ҫ&quot; which are not used in the Russian alphabet.
The written form of the Enets language was created during the 1980s and has been used to produce a number of books. During the 1990s there was a local newspaper with insert in local languages (including Enets language), Советский Таймыр (Soviet Taimyr, modern simple &quot;Taymyr&quot;) published and brief Enets broadcasts on local radio, which shut down in 2003, served as supplements for speakers.

In 2019, the Enets alphabet was reformed, and in April 2020, the Enets primer was published in a new version of the alphabet. The alphabet contains the following letters:

== Grammar ==
Enets nouns vary for number, case, and person-number of the possessor. There is also an intriguing nominal case in which ‘destinativity’ determines the entity is destined for someone. Possessor markers are also used for discourse related purposes, where they are completely devoid of the literal possessive meaning. Enets postpositions are marked for person-number; many postpositions are formed from a small set of relational nouns and case morphology.

=== Morphology ===
The parts of speech in Enets are: nouns, adjectives, numerals, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, postpositions, conjunctions, interjections and connective particles.

The grammatical number is expressed by means of the opposition of the singular, dual and plural forms. There are three declensions, the main (non-possessive), possessive and desiderative declensions, and seven cases in Enets: the nominative, genitive, accusative, lative, locative, ablative and prolative case. The meaning of those cases is expressed by means of suffixes added to nouns, adjectives, pronouns and substantivized verbs. In their fixed forms they also belong to adverbs and postpositions. The possession is expressed by means of the genitive case or possessive suffixes.

Local orientation is based on the three-member distribution: the suffixes of local cases of nouns, adverbs and postpositions are divided among the lative (&quot;to where?&quot;), locative (&quot;where?&quot;) and ablative (&quot;from where?&quot;). The prolative case (&quot;along what?&quot; or &quot;through what?&quot;) expresses an additional fourth local characteristic.

The verbal negation is expressed by the combination of the main verb with a preceding auxiliary negative verb. The auxiliary verb is conjugated according to general rules, but the main verb is in a special inconjugated negative form. There are also some verbs of absence - non-possessiveness. Six moods are contrasted in the Enets language: indicative, conjunctive, imperative, optative, quotative and interrogative. There are three tenses: aorist, preterite and future. 

The category of person with nouns is expressed by means of possessive suffixes, differing in all three numbers of all three persons and used in nouns, pronouns, substantivized verbs, adverbs and postpositions. The category of person with verbs is expressed by means of particular personal suffixes of the verb, differing in all three numbers of all three persons.

There are three conjugations in Enets: subjective, objective and reflexive. These conjugations differ from each other by personal suffixes. Additionally, the objective conjugation uses numerical suffixes, referring to all three numbers of the object. In the case of the reflexive conjugation, the person of the subject and object is the same and a separate suffix indicates reflexivity.

==== Nouns ====
Depending on the final sounds of the word stem, nouns can be divided into two groups: 
# nouns with a final sound other than a laryngal plosive stop, e.g. &quot;dʲuda&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;
# nouns with a final laryngal plosive stop, e.g. &quot;tauʔ&quot; &#x27;Nganasan&#x27;
Either group uses variants of suffixes with a different initial sound (e.g. Loc &quot;dʲuda-han&quot;, &quot;tau-kon&quot;).

There are seven cases in Enets: the nominative, genitive, accusative, lative, locative, ablative and prolative case. The case suffixes are combined with numeral markers, often in a fairly complex manner.

The dual case forms are produced on the basis of an uninflected dual form with the suffix &quot;-hɨʔ/-gɨʔ/-kɨʔ&quot; by adding the respective singular case endings of some postpositions (mainly &quot;nə-&quot;) in local cases.

==== Adjectives ====
There are a number of adjectives that have no specific suffixes, e.g. &quot;utik&quot; &#x27;bad&#x27;, &quot;sojδa&quot; &#x27;good&#x27;, &quot;lodo&quot; &#x27;low&#x27; and &quot;piδe&quot; &#x27;high&#x27;.

Alongside these, there are various suffixal adjectives, e.g. &quot;buse̮-saj ne̮&quot; &#x27;a married woman&#x27;, &quot;bite-δa&quot; &#x27;waterless&#x27;, &quot;uδa-šiδa&quot; &#x27;handless&#x27;, &quot;mȯga-he&quot; &#x27;belonging to the forest&#x27;, &quot;same-raha&quot; &#x27;wolf-like&#x27;, &quot;narδe-de̮&quot; &#x27;red&#x27;, &quot;polδe-de̮&quot; &#x27;black&#x27;.

The adjective does not agree with its head either in number or case, e.g. &quot;agga koja&quot; &#x27;big sterlet&#x27;, &quot;agga koja-hone&quot; (locative), &quot;agga koja-hi̮t&quot; (plural ablative). As an exception, we can refer to the use of the adjective instead of an elliptical noun and as a predicate in the nominal conjugation.

To strengthen a possessive connection, sometimes a respective possessive suffix may be added to the head of an attribute, e.g. &quot;keδerʔ koba-δa ŋul&#x27;ʔ mujuʔ&quot; &#x27;the wild reindeer skin is very strong&#x27; (&quot;its-skin of-the-wild-reindeer...&quot;).

The comparative degree is formed by means of an adjective in the positive degree (in the nominative form) with the word to be compared in the ablative form.

==== Verbs ====
The verbs in Enets can be distributed into two groups in principally the same manner as the noun depending on the final sounds of the word stem. Either group uses the variants of suffixes with different initial sounds.

Seven moods are contrasted: indicative, conjunctive, imperative, optative, quotative and interrogative. There are three tenses: aorist, preterite and future. (These tenses exist practically only in the indicative mood.) The verb has three conjugations: subjective, objective and reflexive. These conjugations differ from each other by personal suffixes. In addition to this the objective conjugation uses numerical suffixes, referring to all three numbers of the object. In the case of reflexive conjugation a separate suffix indicates reflexivity.

===== Finite forms =====
The aorist is either unmarked or with the marker &quot;-ŋV-/-V-&quot;. The temporal meaning of the aorist depends on the aspect of the verb. A prolonged or recurrent action should be understood as taking place in the present, a short-time or single action as having taken place in the past, whereas the influence of the latter is still felt in the present. A distinctly past action is expressed by the preterite with the marker &quot;-ś/-š/-d&#x27;/-t&#x27;/-č&quot;, whereas the marker is placed after personal suffixes. The future action is expressed by the future marker &quot;-d-/-dV-/-t-/-tV-&quot; before personal suffixes.

The objective conjugation uses one type of personal suffixes when the object is in the singular and another type of them with the object in the dual or the plural. In the case of the dual object the dual marker &quot;-hu-/-gu-/-ku-&quot; precedes the dual personal suffixes of the second type, whereas in the case of the plural object, the rise of the stem vowel can be observed. The marker of the reflexive mood is &quot;-i-&quot;, which is standing before personal suffixes.

=== Syntax ===
The syntax of Enets is typical for the family and the area. The Enets language follows Subject-object-verb, head marking in the noun phrase, both head and dependent marking within the clause, non-finite verbal forms used for clause combining. Consequently, the finite verb form (the predicate) is always at the end of a sentence. The negative auxiliary verb immediately precedes the main verb. The object of a sentence always keeps to the word it belongs to.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Numerals ===
Collective numerals are formed combining a separate word namely a form &quot;e̮ʃ&quot; of the auxiliary verb &#x27;to be&#x27; with cardinal numerals, e.g. &quot;siðe e̮ʃ&quot; &#x27;we two, the two of us&#x27;.

Distributive numerals are postpositional constructions of cardinals, combined with the postposition &quot;loð&quot;, e.g. &quot;siðeʔ loð&quot; &#x27;by (in) twos&#x27;.

Iteratives are the plural forms of cardinals, e.g. &quot;ŋobuʔ&quot; &#x27;one time, once&#x27;.

Fractional numerals are cardinals that are combined with the word boʔ &#x27;a half&#x27;, e.g. &quot;nehuʔ boʔ&quot; &#x27;one-third&#x27;.

Temporal numerals are formed from cardinals by means of the suffix &quot;-ʔ&quot;, e.g. &quot;orðede̮ʔ&quot; &#x27;the first time&#x27;.

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====

Two-member constructions are used to decline personal pronouns. The second member of these constructions is either an independent word stem &quot;si-&quot; or a postpositional stem &quot;no-&quot;. The first member may be absent.



==== Other pronouns ====

Reflexive pronouns are pairs of words whose first component consists of personal pronouns, the second is a separate word stem &quot;ker-&quot;, combined with their respective possessive suffixes, e.g. &quot;mod&#x27; keriń&quot; &#x27;I myself&#x27;, &quot;ū kerit&quot; &#x27;you yourself&#x27;, &quot;bu kerta&quot; &#x27;she herself/he himself&#x27; or &quot;modiń keriń&quot; &#x27;we two ourselves&#x27;.

Interrogative pronouns are &quot;kurse̮&quot; &#x27;which?&#x27;, &quot;sēa&quot; &#x27;who?&#x27; (used only for humans) and obu &#x27;what?&#x27; (used for animals and lifeless objects).

Negative pronouns are formed from interrogative pronouns by adding the suffix -hȯru, e.g. obuhȯru.

<text>Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) consist of infections primarily of the brain and spinal cord. They include mostly viral infections, less commonly bacterial infections, fungal infections, prion diseases and protozoan infections. Neonatal meningitis is a particular classification by age.

==By anatomical site==
* Brain abscess, Epidural abscess, including spinal epidural and cranial epidural
* Encephalitis
* Meningitis

==By cause==
There are five main causes of CNS infections, namely bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, protozoan infections and prionic infections.

===Viral===
*Most forms of aseptic meningitis are viral in origin, though neoplastic and Lyme disease meningitis are also aseptic.
* California encephalitis virus
*Central nervous system viral disease
*Cytomegalovirus encephalitis
*SARS-CoV-2
*Eastern equine encephalitis
*Enterovirus encephalitis
* Epstein Barr Virus encephalitis
* Herpes simplex encephalitis
*Influenza encephalitis
* Japanese encephalitis

* Slow virus infections, which include:
** Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
** Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis by Measles virus
** Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
* Rabies
* Tick-borne encephalitis
* Varicella
*Viral encephalitis lists 37 causes
* Viral meningitis
*Western equine encephalitis

===Prionic===
These are transmissible spongiform encephalopathies like:
* Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle
*Chronic wasting disease in deer
* Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant
* Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome
* Kuru
* Scrapie in sheep and goat
*Transmissible mink encephalopathy
* Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy

===Fungal===
* Cryptococcal meningitis

===Protozoan===
* Amoebic brain abscess
* Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis
* Malaria
* Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis
* Toxoplasmosis

===Post-infectious diseases of the central nervous system===
These are not infections but post-infectious CNS diseases:
* Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
* Guillain–Barré syndrome
* PANDAS (controversial hypothesis)
* Sydenham&#x27;s chorea

<text>The Arctic Corsair (H320) is a deep-sea trawler, built in 1960, that was converted to a museum ship in 1999. She is temporarily berthed at Alexandra Dock in Kingston upon Hull, England, pending completion of a new permanent location in the city&#x27;s Museums Quarter. Exhibits and guides aboard the boat tell the story of Hull&#x27;s deep-sea fishing industry.

==Description==
The &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; is Hull’s last surviving sidewinder trawler, a type of ship that formed the backbone of the city’s deep sea fishing fleet. She was built in 1960, at Cook, Welton &amp; Gemmell in Beverley, and was the second diesel-engined trawler built for the Boyd Line, the first being the &quot;Arctic Cavalier&quot; which was launched the previous month. She was designed for the harsh conditions encountered in the Icelandic grounds, having a rivetted rather than welded hull.

==History==
In September 1967 &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; was holed on her starboard side in a collision off the coast of Scotland with the Irish collier &quot;Olive&quot; in thick fog. Attempting to reach harbour in Wick she was beached in Sinclair Bay but eventually repaired and refloated.

In 1973, she broke the world record for landing of cod and haddock from the White Sea.

On 30 April 1976 during the cod wars, she rammed the offshore patrol vessel in the stern, after &quot;Óðinn&quot; had made three attempts to cut the Corsair&#x27;s trawl warps. The skipper, Charles Pitts, said that Icelandic seamen were becoming &quot;more ambitious and dangerous in their tactics&quot;. With his ship holed below the waterline, and patched up temporarily by the Royal Navy, Pitts decided to head for home for permanent repairs. &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; was out of action for several months. In 2017, the vessels, now both museum ships, exchanged their bells as a gesture of cooperation.

In 1978 she was converted for midwater trawling, and in 1981 laid up at Hull. In 1985 she was taken out of retirement and reconverted for normal fishing. She was renamed &quot;Arctic Cavalier&quot; in 1988.

==Museum ship==

In 1991, a campaign led by Adam Fowler of fishing heritage group STAND secured £45,000 from the DTI Hull Task Force which enabled Hull City Council to purchase the trawler in 1993. The vessel immediately reverted to &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot;, and was berthed between Drypool Bridge and Myton Bridge in the River Hull as a museum ship.

After being restored by trainees and volunteers from the STAND, the floating museum opened to the public in 1999. STAND entered into partnership with the City Council to provide volunteers to maintain and act as tour guides. Today, the floating museum is run entirely by volunteers but supported by Hull City Council. &quot;Arctic Corsair&quot; is temporarily closed during restoration work.

In June 2018, it was announced that she was to move to dry-dock in September 2018 while flood defence work is undertaken on the River Hull. This was delayed while other flood defence work was undertaken but on 4 August 2019 was she moved to a temporary berth in Alexandra Dock. Later she will move to a new permanent berth in the redeveloped North End Shipyard in Dock Office Row as part of the Hull Maritime City project, back in the Museums Quarter; initial groundwork on the shipyard&#x27;s visitor centre commenced in November 2022. On 6 October 2021, she was moved by two tugs to Dunston&#x27;s shipyard to undergo restoration work.

<doc id="1249409" wikidata="Q1402157" url="?curid=1249409" title="Koporye">
<text>Koporye (; Finnish: &quot;Kaprio&quot;; ) is a historic village (&quot;selo&quot;) in Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located about west of St. Petersburg and south of the Koporye Bay of the Baltic Sea. Its population in 2017 was 1,603.

== History ==
The first wooden fortress on the coast of the Koporye Bay was built by the Teutonic Knights in the winter of 1240, only to be destroyed by Alexander Nevsky the next year. The second fortress was built in stone by Alexander&#x27;s son Dmitry Alexandrovich in 1280. Enraged by the prince&#x27;s independence, the Novgorodians razed the fortress two years later.

The Swedes took advantage of the lack of a fortress and occupied the banks of the Narva River. The Novgorodians had to restore the stone fort in 1297. Koporye was the strongest stronghold in the region and survived numerous attacks during the Swedish–Novgorodian Wars. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the town was given several times to mercenary princes invited by Novgorodians to protect the northern territories of the republic. While the town had an important fortress, the residences of a prince and several lesser landowners, and was the centre of an important iron-working district, it remained very small, with only 18 households by the end of 15th century.

After Novgorod&#x27;s incorporation into Muscovy, the fortress was strengthened and rebuilt to withstand cannon fire. Most extant structures belong to that period. Russian forces surrendered Koporye during the Livonian War but regained it under the Treaty of Tyavzino.

During the Time of Troubles, Koporye was attacked by some 2,000 Swedes. The Russian garrison had to surrender. In 1656, Russia unsuccessfully tried to retake the village. Koporye remained Swedish until 1703, known as Koporje or Caporie/Capurien, constituting an important part of Swedish Ingria.

As the Gulf of Finland grew shallow and receded to the north, the site began to lose its maritime importance. In 1703, during the Great Northern War, a major Russian army under Boris Sheremetev regained Koporye, which was defended by 80 Swedish soldiers under the commandant, Captain Wasili Apolloff. Huge gaps in the walls from the disastrous fire of the Russian artillery may still be seen.

Despite some repairs undertaken in the 19th century, the fortress survives in a ruined state. Today, it is a museum.

<doc id="1249413" wikidata="Q5714204" url="?curid=1249413" title="Heng Ee High School">
<text>Heng Ee High School (; ) is a Chinese conforming national-type Catholic secondary school located in George Town; Penang.

As Heng Ee High School is a Chinese secondary school (SMJK), Chinese language (Bahasa Cina) is a compulsory subject to be taken during Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) for all students with Chinese primary school background (SJKC). 

==Founding==
Heng Ee High School was founded by a Belgian Roman Catholic expatriate missionary priest, Dato&#x27; Father Arthur A. Julien, from the Paris Foreign Missions Society in 1957.

Father Julien arrived in Malaysia in 1952. He served as parish priest of the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows from 1961 to 1963, and as assistant parish priest to the Church of the Holy Spirit (now Cathedral of the Holy Spirit) with Father Paul Decroix between 1976 and 1984. Father Julien&#x27;s work extended beyond the church. He conducted missionary work with the community in Batu Maung, Bayan Lepas and Sungai Dua, and also regularly visited the detainees in Pulau Jerejak. His ability to converse in Mandarin and later Hokkien, endeared him to the local Chinese community.

Father Julien set up Heng Ee High School along Hamilton Road and Heng Ee Primary School within the grounds of the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows along Macalister Road. He died on 11 September 2004.

===Crest===
The crest is colored blue which denotes brotherhood and mercy and on the other hand the background is colored white, symbolizing pureness, honesty and good morality.

Armorial bearings:
* The Star symbolizes the light of knowledge. It also symbolizes mankind&#x27;s noble aspirations.
* The Mountains symbolizes the steadfastness and our eternal belief.
* The River represents the ever renewing dynamic force of nature.

==Amenities==
The campus comprises an area of 6.5 hectares and consists of 6 blocks with a field.

===Block A===
Block A was the first and the oldest building to be built. Completed in 1967, the four-story building comprises 17 classrooms, and offices for senior assistants.

===Block B===
Block B was built in 1969, houses the Principal&#x27;s office, a prayer room, 2 computer rooms, 4 science laboratories, a Biology laboratory, a Chemistry laboratory, a Physics laboratory and an arts room.

===Block C===
Block C was the adjoining block that connect Block A to Block B where the school library, co-operative outlet, counseling room, SPBT room, media room as well as where the school administration computer room is located. Three classrooms were located on Level 4. In September 2011, the school library is relocated to Level 2 Block F Bangunan Wawasan meanwhile the vacant library now served as the storeroom. The school has not announced any plans to develop the vacant library for the time being.

===Block D===
Block D was completed in 1975. The first floor of Block D was formerly the school canteen and was currently used as the staffroom and the meeting room. Opposite the staffroom was the air-conditioned lecture hall. Above the staffroom was the school hall (光前堂). Lecture Hall 2 was situated on the second hall opposite the balcony of the school hall.

===Block E===
Block E was completed in 1987. The ground floor consists of a carpentry room, a cooking room, a sewing room, an electronic room, the prefects room and a gymnasium. The air-conditioned Music Room I was located on the second floor. In 1999, the school topped up another floor on Block E which includes an additional 7 classrooms and another air-conditioned Music Room II to accommodate the increasing number of students.

===Block F: Bangunan Wawasan===


The Bangunan Wawasan (Chinese: 宏愿楼) was built in 2011. The eight-story Bangunan Wawasan comprises a foyer at Level 1, a fully air-conditioned modern library at Level 2, two multi-purpose halls at Level 3, three lecture theatres at Level 4, a rooftop loft and an astronomical observatory at the rooftop. Bangunan Wawasan is also equipped with the necessary infrastructure and ICT facilities to provide the students with a positive and supportive environment that is conducive for academic and social growth.

Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce had donated RM2 mil for the construction of Bangunan Wawasan along with other efforts and sponsors. This prompted the school board of directors to rename the building as Bangunan Wawasan Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce.

The building was officially launched on 9 September 2011. Present to officiate the new building were the Chief Minister, Heng Ee board of trustees chairman Datuk Loh Geok Beng, and chamber president Tan Sri Tan Kok Ping.

===Sports facilities===
The sports infrastructures in this school include two basketball courts and two volleyball courts located opposite the school (where the ex-pupils association is), a mini gymnasium(not open to students who are not in the Body Building Club)on Level 1 of Block E, two badminton courts in the school hall, a football field and a 6 lane 100 meter running track. There is also table tennis tables situated in the school hall which can be set up.

===Canteen===
The original location of the school canteen was at Level 1 of Block D which was the current staffroom. Years later, it was moved to a bigger site beside Block E. Due to the school&#x27;s expansion plan for the 8-storey Bangunan Wawasan, the canteen was demolished and moved to a temporary site behind Block B while waiting for the completion of Bangunan Wawasan. At first the school planned to rebuild the canteen at Level 1 of Bangunan Wawasan. As the number of students increased gradually over the years, the school decided to make it permanent instead of shifting back to its original site. At the same time, three ventilating machines were installed.

<text>Black &amp; White 2 is a video game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts released in October 2005. It is the sequel to 2001&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White.&quot; A Mac OS X port was released in January 2009, and released for download via the Mac App Store in November 2014. The game blends real-time strategy and god game elements.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the role of a god called from the void (nothingness) to help the villagers who invoked them. The player must help develop their nature according to their good or evil desires. The player is physically represented in the world as an avatar-like creature, which takes the form of a giant anthropomorphic ape, lion, wolf, turtle, cow, or tiger. The creature can grow to an immense size, and adopt a good or evil persona based on how the player rewards or punishes their actions. In addition to the god simulation and city-building elements introduced in the original &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; also features elements of real-time strategy gameplay, with the addition of controllable warfare and fighting units.

&quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; features a more conventional heads-up display (HUD) system than its predecessor. Rather than the experimental HUD-less gameplay seen in the original game, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; features HUD notifications that inform players of their creature&#x27;s state of mind, the effects of their actions on their creature, the status of villages, etc. The user interface is almost button-less. The player sees little else on the screen but the world, the player&#x27;s hand, and toolbars which the player can make disappear.

The only way the player can directly interact with this world is through the player&#x27;s hand, which can be used to pick up people, trees, and food. It can also directly push and pull objects on the ground, allowing the player to directly participate in combat in a limited way. The player can also cast miracles for a certain amount of &quot;Prayer Power&quot; (in essence, &quot;Mana&quot;), which comes from the player&#x27;s believers.

To do things such as cast miracles, the player moves the hand in such a way to make a symbol on the ground, referred to as a gesture. This activates the miracle, and if the player has enough Prayer Power, it appears in the player&#x27;s hand ready to cast. Miracles have a variety of different uses. There are six ordinary miracles: fire, lightning, water, shield, heal, and meteor, (each of which can be thrown or poured), and four epic wonders mireacles: siren, hurricane, earthquake, and volcano, which require their respective epic wonder building to be charged and cast.

&quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; can be played in three ways: Good, Evil, or combination of the two. Evil involves the use of fear, torture, conquest and destruction using armies along with the creation of building such as a pit of torture. Good involves benevolence, more positive city building, and looking after the populace, particularly defending it from attacks. Both of these require ore and wood, of which there is a limited amount.

The player&#x27;s tribe is the Greeks. Other tribes include Egypt, Norse, Aztec, and Japanese.

As in &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, players can create disciples to do the player&#x27;s job in certain areas of the game while the player tends to other business. For example, if the player needs to lead an invasion, they can set villagers, and even their creature to farm for them while they lead an invasion.

===Creatures===
The player can choose between several creatures, including the ape, lion, wolf, cow and tiger, although the tiger is not available in the base game. The player&#x27;s creature can do most things the player can do, such as cast miracles. Since the player trains the creature, their personality can become whatever the player makes of it. Each tribe, like the player, owns creatures at some stage. As the game progresses, the enemies&#x27; creatures increase in strength and size. Unlike &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, in which the creature had to be taught miracles through repetition, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; allows the player to &#x27;buy&#x27; creature miracles with &#x27;Tribute&#x27; currency. Along with this, &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; allows the player to revisit everything they&#x27;ve taught their creature in order to alter and fine-tune it at any time, while the original &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; only allowed changes to be made as the creature repeated an action.

==Plot==
The player comes upon a scene of a Greek city being devastated by a huge Aztec army after being summoned from a &quot;pure prayer&quot;. After the player saves a certain number of people, their people are transported to a new land with a handful of refugee worshipers, the player must re-establish a power base from which to eventually defeat the Aztec empire. To do so, the player must conquer the Norse, the Japanese and the Aztecs, either by peace or war. Throughout the game there is a theme of &quot;The prophecy&quot;, which states that a tribe will be destroyed by the mightiest power in the world but will receive a god who will lead them to glory and dominance of the world.

The good and evil advisors return, both once again voiced by Marc Silk, except there were some significant cosmetic changes for the good advisor - now making use of the more recent graphical capabilities available for his beard and hair.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

== Expansion pack ==

An expansion pack, &quot;Black &amp; White 2: Battle of the Gods&quot;, was released in April 2006. It includes a new creature, new lands, miracles, enemies, challenges and the tiger from the &quot;Black &amp; White 2&quot; Special Edition. The premise involves the player&#x27;s return to Eden, where they discover that the Aztecs have raised their own evil deity which must be confronted head-on for control of the land. The player may choose how they will challenge this new god, either by countering the evil deity&#x27;s actions with good deeds, or attempting to defeat through evil actions.

<text>Woodford Reserve is a brand of premium small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced at Woodford Reserve Distillery, in Woodford County, Kentucky, by the Brown-Forman Corporation.

It is made from a mixture of copper pot still spirits produced at the company&#x27;s Woodford Reserve Distillery, and column still spirits from the Brown Forman Distillery in Shively, Kentucky. Each 45.2% alcohol by volume (90.4 US Proof) bottle bears a unique batch and bottle number. The brand was introduced in 1996. Domestic sales of Woodford Reserve surpassed one million cases in 2021.

==History==
The Woodford Reserve Distillery, formerly known as the Old Oscar Pepper Distillery and later the Labrot &amp; Graham Distillery, is approximately eight miles from the town of Versailles in north-central Kentucky, off U.S. Route 60 between Interstate 64 and Versailles.

Distilling began on the site of the current day distillery in 1812. Although the site has not been continuously operational as a distillery since, the main structure, built in 1838, stands as one of the oldest distilleries in Kentucky. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is designated as a National Historic Landmark for its well-preserved distillery architecture and its role in the development of the bourbon industry.

Originally established by Elijah Pepper, the distillery was passed on to his son and known as the Oscar Pepper Distillery when James C. Crow worked there in the mid-19th century. During this time Crow undertook a series of activities that improved and codified the understanding and quality of key bourbon-making processes such as sour mash fermentation, pot still distillation and barrel maturation. After Oscar Pepper died in 1867 the distillery was passed to his son James E. Pepper. The Pepper family sold the property to Leopold Labrot and James Graham in 1878, who owned and operated it (except during Prohibition) until it was sold to the Brown-Forman Corporation in 1941. Brown-Forman operated it until the late 1960s, then sold the property and its accompanying acreage to a local farmer. Brown-Forman re-purchased the property in 1993, refurbished it, and brought it back into operation. The Woodford Reserve brand was introduced to the market in 1996. The distillery was renamed Woodford Reserve Distillery in 2004.

The distillery produces: Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, Woodford Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey, Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey, and Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey. It also distills some limited edition releases, including Woodford Reserve Master&#x27;s Collection, Woodford Reserve Master&#x27;s Collection Batch Proof, a Kentucky-only Distillery Series, and a special commemorative bottle it releases annually in conjunction with its official sponsorship of the Kentucky Derby. 

In 2025, Woodford Reserve released Chocolate Whisper Redux Bourbon, marking the brand’s highest-proof bourbon to date at 139.4 proof (69.7% ABV), as a limited-time release.

=== Master Distiller ===
Up until 2023, the Master Distiller of Woodford Reserve was Chris Morris (a position he held from 2003) and the Assistant Master Distiller was Elizabeth McCall.

In 2023, Elizabeth McCall was named Master Distiller of Woodford Reserve with Chris Morris to serve as Master Distiller Emeritus. McCall had been with Brown-Forman since 2009, and was previously the Woodford Reserve Assistant Master Distiller.

==Reviews and accolades==
International Spirit ratings organizations and liquor review bodies have generally given Woodford Reserve solid scores. At the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Woodford Reserve&#x27;s best performances have been in 2005 and 2013, winning a double gold medal each time. It has also won gold (2006–2007, 2011–2012) and silver (2008, 2010) medals at this annual event. The Beverage Testing Institute has given the Reserve scores of between 90 and 91 and &quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot; awarded it a 90–95 point rating. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, &quot;Wine Enthusiast&quot;, the Beverage Testing Institute, and others, had Woodford Reserve ranked in its highest (&quot;Tier 1&quot;) scoring category until 2016, and subsequently had it ranked as &quot;Tier 2.&quot;

== Union busting ==
In April 2024, a judge with the National Labor Relations Board found that Woodford Reserve had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of the National Labor Relations Act by timing changes in merit pay and vacation policies, as well as handing out bottles of whiskey to workers, in order to influence the outcome of a unionization vote at its distillery in Versailles, Kentucky.

<text>The osmotic stress technique is a method for measuring the effect of water on biological molecules, particularly enzymes. Just as the properties of molecules can depend on the presence of salts, pH, and temperature, they can depend significantly on the amount of water present. In the osmotic stress technique, flexible neutral polymers such as polyethylene glycol and dextran are added to the solution containing the molecule of interest, replacing a significant part of the water. The amount of water replaced is characterized by the chemical activity of water.

<doc id="1249444" wikidata="Q3809610" url="?curid=1249444" title="John Shaft">
<text>John Shaft is a fictional private investigator created by author/screenwriter Ernest Tidyman for the 1970 novel of the same name. He was portrayed by Richard Roundtree in the original 1971 film and in its four sequels—&quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot;, &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot;, &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000) and &quot;Shaft&quot; (2019)—as well as in the seven 1973–74 &quot;Shaft&quot; television films. Samuel L. Jackson portrayed his son (introduced as his nephew), named John Shaft II, in &quot;Shaft&quot; (2000) and &quot;Shaft&quot; (2019), and Jessie Usher portrayed the character&#x27;s grandson (named John &quot;J.J.&quot; Shaft Jr.) in &quot;Shaft&quot; (2019). The blurb on the paperback on which the original film is based states Shaft is &quot;Hotter than Bond, cooler than Bullitt.&quot;

==Fictional biography==
===Abilities===
John Shaft&#x27;s weapon of choice is a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36, Beretta 92FS or an M1911 pistol. Shaft is also a practitioner of several styles of martial arts that includes western Boxing, Wing Chun, Judo, Jujitsu, Shotokan, and Kyokushin Karate.

== Shaft franchise ==

===Novel series===
The franchise began with the novel &quot;Shaft&quot;, which provides a much more detailed backstory for John Shaft than the one seen in the film series. All of the books in the original 1970s series are credited solely to Shaft creator Ernest Tidyman, but from &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score&quot; onward Tidyman wrote them with assistance from ghostwriters Robert Turner and Philip Rock.

* &quot;Shaft&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Shaft Among the Jews&quot; (1972)

* &quot;The Last Shaft&quot; (1975) - published only in England

====Recurring relationships in the novels and films====

===Comic strip===
Between the release of the first &quot;Shaft&quot; film and the novel &quot;Shaft Among the Jews&quot;, Tidyman began developing a &quot;Shaft&quot; daily syndicated newspaper comic strip. He commissioned artist Don Rico, with whom he produced 24 sample strips, but despite the character&#x27;s popularity in both novels and films he was unable to find a syndicate interested in distributing the &quot;Shaft&quot; strip, which remains unpublished.

===Comic book series===
The Shaft! comic book was published by Dynamite Entertainment, written by David F. Walker and illustrated by Bilquis Evely, beginning in December 2014. New stories following young John Shaft&#x27;s earliest adventures were adapted closely from the Ernest Tidyman novels.

* &quot;Shaft: A Complicated Man&quot; (2014) (writer: David F. Walker, artist: Bilquis Evely)
* &quot;Shaft: Imitation of Life&quot; (2016) (writer: David F. Walker, artist: Dietrich Smith)

===Film and television franchise===
====Film series====


====Television films====

The television show ran from 1973 to 1974, with Richard Roundtree reprising the role of John Shaft. There were seven 90-minute movies, part of the &quot;New CBS Tuesday Night Movies&quot;, rotating with &quot;Hawkins&quot;, which starred James Stewart.

====Cast and characters====

* A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film.

==John Shaft in other media==
* Burger King utilized the Shaft character for promotion, and even somewhat parodied Shaft utilizing Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.
* The USA Network&#x27;s promo for their series &quot;Monk&quot; was modeled after the Shaft remake in 2000.
* Geena Davis parodied the Shaft remake/sequel in promos for her short-lived television series, &quot;The Geena Davis Show&quot;.
* In Season 2&#x27;s episode &quot;Ants in Pants!&quot;, &quot;The Tick&quot; featured the Tick meeting &quot;Taft.&quot; On confirming that it is he, the man says &quot;Darn right.&quot; This would be reprised in the Season 3 episode, &quot;That Moustache Feeling&quot;.
* A song entitled &quot;Shaft in Greenland&quot; appeared on The Dead Milkmen&#x27;s album &quot;Soul Rotation&quot;.
* In the TV series &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, Will Smith frequently references Shaft as one of his favorite film characters, believing the character to be a real person (Richard Roundtree himself guest-starred in two episodes of the show, playing two different characters.)
* In the anime TV series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; episode &quot;Mushroom Samba&quot;, he is the namesake of one of the Shaft brothers, hoping to avenge his brother&#x27;s death. He is voiced by Hōchū Ōtsuka in the 1999 Japanese version and by Beau Billingslea in the 2001 English dub.
* Broomhilda Von Shaft, a character in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, was named to suggest a relationship to John Shaft. Stated Tarantino: &quot;Her and Django will eventually have a baby, and then that baby will have a baby, and that baby will have a baby, and that baby will have a baby, and that baby will have a baby ... and one of these days, John Shaft will be born&quot;.

==Parodies in other films==
* &quot;Good Burger&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;
* &quot;I Got The Hook Up&quot;
* &quot;Black Dynamite&quot;
* &quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot;

==Reception==
The character has had a mostly positive response. Shaft had an enormous impact on the way Black men were portrayed in American film. Prior to Shaft many depictions of Black men showed them as servile, mild-mannered, and in positions of low status such as servants or janitors. The way Richard Roundtree portrayed Shaft created a Black male style that was so distinct and pervasive it became known as “swag”. After Shaft the representation of Black masculinity in American films was dramatically changed. It became the norm to see black men in roles that before would have been filled by white men.

<doc id="1249449" wikidata="Q5941888" url="?curid=1249449" title="Humus (band)">
<text>Humus is a psychedelic band from Mexico that has been active since the late 1980s.

==History==

===Early history===
Humus was founded in 1987 by Jorge Beltran as a one man band, where he played all instruments in home recordings made through the ping pong recording technique. He chose the name &quot;Humus&quot; based on the earthy, humus-like sound caused by sound degradation caused by the reduction mixing. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Beltran released five cassettes, causing interest in the underground quarters of Mexico City, where there had been a long history of progressive rock.

Jose Luis Garnica, a long time friend of Jorge&#x27;s and a rock connoisseur, was very much impressed by the quality of sound of these recordings, but mostly by Beltran&#x27;s musicianship, so he became producer of Humus&#x27;s first LP, &quot;Tus Oidos mienten&quot; in June 1992. The album finally gave recording status to Humus, and soon international reviews from the U.S., Germany, France, and in particular from Italy began to emerge, praising the new band from Mexico.

===Second album and lineup change===
From the second album, called simply &quot;Humus&quot; (released Dec. 1994), the one man band concept changed to a live performing band, which included old time school friend and bass player Victor Basurto, with whom he had formed their first band, Stomago Sagrado in the late 1970s. Victor had designed the cover for Tus Oidos Mienten, and has been in charge for the art of all recordings both musicians have been involved with ever since.

Several local tours took place, and the drum stool was occupied by no less than 8 drummers during the 1990s and well nigh into the 21st century.

===Third and fourth albums and side project===
A third album, &quot;Malleus Crease&quot; was released in 1995. This album, along with brother Project Frolic Froth&#x27;s album Ouroboros were also released in Italy by the D-dabliu label in LP format. &quot;Humus 4 degrees&quot;, released in 1997, is the band&#x27;s only album to exist only in CD format, all others were both CD and LP productions. This album was released through Smogless Records and newly formed Nuggetphase productions, and from there all albums produced by either of the bands led by Jorge and Victor have been released in the Nuggetphase label.

Also in 1997 Humus found themselves in an international tour of England and Italy. In Exeter they recorded an album with american Dave Tor, who became singer for the only vocal album ever made by either Jorge or Victor, and for this project a new name was devised: Euphoric Darkness, since it detached completely from the instrumental approach always favoured by Humus. The resulting album was named &quot;Colours You Can Hear&quot; and only 100 copies were made.

===Fifth album to present ===
In Pesaro they recorded Humus&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Whispering Galleries&quot;, under the production of Italy&#x27;s doom metal legend Paul Chain, who also contributed to the album. Three hundred numbered copies were made.

Since 1998 Humus has recorded no less than five albums, though none has been released as of 2014. The band continues to be active, though members live in different continents: Jorge Beltran lives in Mexico and Victor Basurto lives in The Netherlands. The manage to continue playing together through the use of the new communication technologies. Because of their limited press runs, Humus albums have been rare, and some of them reach up to US$250 in international distributor listings. However, late in 2006 Smogless Records put out new CD editions of the first three Humus albums, &quot;Tus Oidos Mienten&quot;, &quot;Humus&quot;, and &quot;Malleus Crease&quot;. 
A totally new album called &quot;Happy Days Ahead&quot; was independently released on July 23, 2011, the first one in digital format only, available through some of the main digital stores.

<text>The Manchester Wolves were a professional arena football team, based at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, which folded at the end of the 2009 season along with the rest of the league. They played in the East Division of the American Conference of the AF2 league, which was the minor league of the Arena Football League.

==Team history==
===Inception===
On July 19, 2001, Uncasville, Connecticut was awarded an AF2 expansion team. On December 12, 2001, Mohegan Sun and Dr. Eric Margenau, President/Chief Executive Officer of United Sports Ventures, announced that the new expansion AF2 franchise would be named the Mohegan Wolves. Margenau introduced Gary Porter, as the head coach for the team that would first take the field April 5, 2002 at the Mohegan Sun Arena against the Albany Conquest. Gary Porter, previously led the expansion Peoria Pirates to a 7-9 record in 2001.

The team name was selected through a &quot;Name the Team&quot; contest sponsored by WCTY, Mohegan Sun and X-Tra Mart. A Jewett City, Connecticut resident, came up with the winning name. The winner won four season tickets for the 2002 Mohegan Wolves season, dinner for four on the night of the team&#x27;s first home game, and a team merchandise package.

===New owners===
On February 6, 2003, the AF2 league office announced that Big Win Ventures LLC would now be the operator of the Mohegan Wolves. Dr. Margenau, the former principal operator of the Mohegan Wolves, assumed the role of President of Big Win and remained a substantial shareholder. Big Win, which is privately held, also announced the same day that it has assumed operations of the Albany Conquest AF2 franchise.

For the 2003 season, AFL veteran head coach Mark Stoute led the Wolves and dramatically improved their record. The team finished with a 10-6 regular season record (which included a 7-1 home record) and won their first postseason game on August 2, 2003 against the Atlantic Division Champion Cape Fear Wildcats 50-47. The season ended the next week on August 8, 2003 with a 47-30 loss to the Tennessee Valley Vipers.

===Relocation===
On October 29, 2003, the league office approved the relocation of the Mohegan Wolves team to Manchester, New Hampshire. The Wolves’ move to Manchester was made possible through the efforts of a group of local businessmen and Dr. Margenau. The team of local investors was led by longtime area resident Steve Schubert, a former player for the New England Patriots and Chicago Bears.

During the first season in Manchester, New Hampshire, the new head coach, Rik Richards, was first fired midway through the season and replaced by his coordinator Ron Hill. And assistant coaches Mark Page and Ryan Ray. The Wolves finished out the season with a 5-11 record.

===New coach/Turnaround===
Things turned around in 2005 with new head coach, Ben Bennett. Bennett, a veteran coach and player with Arena Football and AF2 transformed the Manchester team to a 12-4 regular season record and won the East Division. The regular season included a 10-game win streak. The season ended with a first round playoff loss at home on August 12, 2005 against the Louisville Fire 56-69.

===Quarterback problems===
In 2006, the Wolves had loftier expectations because of many key players and Head Coach Ben Bennett returning. The team had issues at Quarterback however as D. Bryant and Kyle Rowley were ineffective while trying to fill the shoes of the 2005 starter and current Jake Eaton. With four games remaining in the season and the team sitting at 5-7, Coach Bennett turned to former Ohio State Quarterback Steve Bellisari. A failed defensive back in the NFL, Bellisari took over of the Wolves offense and led them to four straight victories which took the Wolves from the bottom of the division to making the playoffs and hosting a first-round game.

Bellisari found his favorite target Steve Gonzalez and the Wolves had a defense with the tandem of William Haith and Allistair Sebastien as the Wolves got a 55-47 win against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers in front of 3,732 fans at Verizon Wireless Arena. The Wolves season would end one week later in Florida however as Steve Bellisari was driving the Wolves down the field late in the fourth quarter when he threw his last pass as a Wolf, a game-sealing interception to the Florida Firecats. The final score was Florida 40, Manchester 39.

===Sponsors===
In 2007 HAVOC announced a partnership with the Wolves as well as other AFL teams.

<text>Arthur Lee Shell Jr. (born November 26, 1946) is an American former professional football player and coach. He played as an offensive tackle in the American Football League (AFL) and later in the National Football League (NFL) for the Oakland / Los Angeles Raiders. He played college football at Maryland State College—now University of Maryland Eastern Shore—and was drafted by the Raiders in the third round (80th overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft. He was later a twice head coach for the Raiders. He holds the distinction of becoming the second African American head coach in the history of professional football and the first in the sport&#x27;s modern era. Shell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013 and into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989.

== Early life ==
Shell was born on November 26, 1946, in Charleston or North Charleston, South Carolina. He was the oldest child of Arthur Lee Shell Sr., a machine set operator, and Gertrude Shell, who died when Shell was 15. After her death, Shell took on added responsibility caring for his siblings. Shell attended the segregated Bonds-Wilson High School, which no longer exists, graduating in 1964. He was coached by James Fields and Eugene Gray. He made all-state teams in both basketball and football.

In 2015, Shell was inducted into the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame.

== College ==
Shell went to college at Maryland State College, now the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), an historically black college in Princess Anne, Maryland. He was coached by Roosevelt &quot;Sandy&quot; Gilliam, and played offensive tackle and defensive tackle on the football team. He was named a Little All-America his senior year in 1967, All Conference in three seasons, and was named All-America by the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1967. Shell&#x27;s teams were 20–8–1. Future NFL and College Football Hall of Fame running back Emerson Boozer was one of his teammates. He graduated in 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial arts. Shell is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

He was inducted into the UMES Hall of Fame in 1984, Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) Hall of Fame in 2006, the Black College Hall of Fame in 2011, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2013. Since 2000, Shell has held the UMES Celebrity Golf Classic, a celebrity golf tournament.

==Playing career==
Shell was drafted in the third round by the American Football League&#x27;s Oakland Raiders. Playing offensive tackle, Shell participated in 23 postseason playoff contests in the AFL and NFL, including eight AFC or AFL championship games, a loss in Super Bowl II, and victories in Super Bowls XI and XV. He was a four time All Pro (two times first team and two second team), and was named to eight Pro Bowls. 

He played 15 seasons for the Raiders. He was a top special teams player his first two years, and then moved to offensive line in his third year, becoming equally adept at pass and run blocking. Shell played 156 straight games for the Raiders until he suffered a preseason injury in 1979, and after he recovered, Shell played another 51 straight games until he was injured again in 1982, his final season. Shell played next to hall of fame and 100th Anniversary All-Time teammate guard Gene Upshaw in three different decades. He was also offensive linemates with hall of fame and 100th Anniversary All-Time teammate Jim Otto and hall of fame offensive tackle Bob Brown.

Shell was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989. In 2019, he was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked number 55 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; listed Shell as the 76th greatest player ever. He was also a member of the 1970s All-Decade Team and the Super Bowl Silver Anniversary Team (1990).

==Coaching career==
Shell was an offensive line coach with the Raiders from 1983 to 1988. In 1989, the Raiders owner Al Davis hired Shell as his head coach to replace Mike Shanahan, becoming the first black head coach in modern NFL history, and the first since Fritz Pollard in 1925. In the NFL&#x27;s early years, Pollard, an African American running back, was a player-coach for the Hammond (Indiana) Pros from 1923-1925. Pollard had earlier been a teammate of Paul Robeson on the Akron Pros of the American Professional Football Association. 

===Los Angeles Raiders===
Through Al Davis, Shell is a member of the Sid Gillman coaching tree. As coach of the Raiders from 1989 to 1994 (at the time located in Los Angeles), Shell coached 12 games in 1989, and 16 games/year from 1990 to 1994, compiling a record of 54 wins and 38 losses. Shell was named AFC Coach of the Year in 1990, when the Raiders won the AFC West division with a 12–4 record, and advanced to the AFC championship game in the playoffs, becoming the first African-American coach to lead the team to the Conference Championship game. Shell also received the Maxwell Club&#x27;s coach of the year award (the Greasy Neale Award), and &quot;Pro Football Weekly&#x27;s&quot; NFL Coach of the Year Award. Al Davis, owner of the Raiders, fired Shell after a 9–7 season in 1994, a move Davis later called &quot;a mistake.&quot;

===After the Raiders===
After leaving the Raiders, Shell went on to coaching positions with the Kansas City Chiefs (offensive line coach 1995-1996) and Atlanta Falcons (offensive line coach for four years before resigning in early 2001), before serving as a senior vice president for the NFL, in charge of football operations. In 2004, Shell became the NFL&#x27;s Senior Vice President over football operations, supervising all football operations and development.

===2006 return to Raiders===
Shell was working for the NFL when he was officially re-hired by the-then Oakland Raiders as head coach on February 11, 2006. After leading the team to its worst record (2 wins, 14 losses) since 1962, despite having one of the best defenses, Shell was fired for the second time as head coach of the Raiders on January 4, 2007.

===Head coaching record===
==Personal life==
Shell is the father of Billie Dureyea Shell, the author of the &quot;Unfaithful&quot; book trilogy, and the great uncle of Brandon Shell, an offensive lineman who was drafted in 2016 by the New York Jets.

He was Deputy Cup-Bearer of Lithuania from 1510, voivode of Kiev Voivodeship from 1510, Field Hetman of Lithuania in 1521, castellan of Trakai from 1522, castellan of Vilnius from 1527, Marshal of the Court from 1528, Grand Hetman of Lithuania from 1531, Starost of Hrodna, Namiestnik of Vilnius, Maišiagala, Mereck, Utena, Mozyrsk, Lida, Skidal, , Kryńsk and Oziersk. He was a progenitor of the Biržai–Dubingiai (also known as Protestant) Radziwiłł family line.

He was renowned for his military achievements and as a talented politician. He took part in various conflicts against Muscovy, the Cossacks and the Tatars. Achieving around 30 military victories, he has been referred as the Lithuanian Hercules.

In 1526 as a member of the Lithuanian Council of Lords he unsuccessfully petitioned the Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I the Old for the renewal of a Kingdom of Lithuania under the rule of Sigismund the Old&#x27;s son, Sigismund II Augustus. In the 1530s, acting with his brother Jan Radziwiłł, he was in almost total control of Lithuania&#x27;s internal affairs.

As a member of influential Radziwiłł family, Jerzy worked to increase his family estate. With his death it was inherited by his only son Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł. He had two daughters, of which the younger Barbara Radziwiłł became mistress and later queen to King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund Augustus, which greatly strengthened the Radziwiłł family&#x27;s position in Poland and Lithuania.

==Marriage and issue==

He married Barbara Kiszka h. Dąbrowa and later Barbara Kola h. Junosza. They had three children:

* Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł (1512–1584), who would later become Grand Hetman of Lithuania, married to Katarzyna Tomicka from Iwno h. Łodzia
* Anna Elżbieta Radziwiłł (1518–1558), married Symeon Holszański Dubrowicki h. Hipocentaur and marszałek of Volhynia Piotr Kiszka h. Dąbrowa (died 1550) in 1548
* Barbara Radziwiłł (1520–1551), married Stanisław Gasztołd and after his death in 1547 secretly married king of Poland Sigismund II Augustus and was crowned the queen consort the following year, despite protests by the Sejm and the Senate

<text>Maximus or Maximos (, &quot;Maksim&quot;; died 6 December 1305) was a metropolitan bishop of the Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus&#x27; in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. He was consecrated in Constantinople and reigned from 1283 to 1305. Maximos was of Greek origin. 

At that time, the Rus&#x27; princes were vassals of the Golden Horde. Khan Tokhta wanted to eliminate the princes&#x27; semi-independence. To that effect, he had sent his brother Tudan to the Rus&#x27; lands in 1293. Tudan&#x27;s army devastated fourteen towns. Tokhta himself (also known as Tokhta-Temur) went to Tver and forced Dmitry of Pereslavl (also known as Dmitry Alexandrovich), who was allied to Nogai Khan, to abdicate. Russian chroniclers depicted these events as &quot;The harsh-time of Batu returns.&quot;. Some sources suggest that Tokhta and Nogai, who was effectively the co-emperor, had worked together. 

Maximos was known for his ecclesiastic trips to the Golden Horde and for mediating between the quarreling princes of the north-eastern Rus&#x27; (e.g. Dmitry of Pereslav and Andrey of Gorodets, the sons of Alexander Nevsky). Under instructions from the Khan, Maximus left Kiev in 1299 and transferred the metropolitan chair to the city of Vladimir which is situated east of Moscow. Following that, Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople established the Metropolis of Halych in 1303 with its see in Halych in the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.

In 1301, Maximos attended a patriarchal council in Constantinople. He supported the Prince of Tver and Vladimir Mikhail Yaroslavich in his struggle with Prince of Moscow Yuri Danilovich for the title of Grand Duke.

He was canonised a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church, and his feast day is celebrated on December 6 (December 19, N.S.).

<doc id="1249468" wikidata="Q657647" url="?curid=1249468" title="Hans Haacke">
<text>Hans Haacke (born August 12, 1936) is a German-born artist who lives and works in New York City. Haacke is considered a &quot;leading exponent&quot; of institutional critique, and is considered to be the most harsh and consistent critic of museums among the Euro-American artists of his time.

==Early life==
Haacke was born in Cologne, Germany. He studied at the &quot;Staatliche Werkakademie&quot; in Kassel, Germany, from 1956 to 1960. In 1959, Haacke was hired to assist with the second documenta, working as a guard and tour guide. He was a student of Stanley William Hayter, a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962, he studied on a Fulbright grant at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. From 1967 to 2002, Haacke was a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City.
During his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957–1966). This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art&#x27;s metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.

Although their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke&#x27;s early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.

These early installations focused on systems and processes. &quot;Condensation Cube&quot; (1963–65) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s, his art had found a more specific focus.

==Systems work (1970–present)==
Haacke&#x27;s interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems. In most of his work after the late 1960s, Haacke focused on the art world and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; he often underlines its effects in site-specific ways.

Haacke has been outspoken throughout his career about demystifying the relationship between museums and businesses and their individual practices. He writes, &quot;what we have here is a real exchange of capital: financial capital on the part of the sponsors and symbolic capital on the part of the sponsored&quot;. Using this concept from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Haacke has underlined the idea that corporate sponsorship of art enhances the sponsoring corporations&#x27; public reputation, which is of material use to them. Haacke believes, moreover, that both parties are aware of this exchange, and as an artist, Haacke is intent on making this relationship clear to viewers.

In 1970, Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled &quot;Information&quot; to be held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue. The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled &quot;MoMA Poll&quot;, but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, &quot;Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon&#x27;s Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?&quot; Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent Plexiglas ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots. Haacke&#x27;s question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as institutional critique. &quot;MoMA Poll&quot; was cited in 2019 by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the works of art that defined the contemporary age.

In one of his best-known works, which quickly became an art historical landmark, &quot;Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, A Real Time Social System, as of May 1, 1971,&quot; Haacke took on the real-estate holdings of one of New York City&#x27;s biggest slum landlords. The work exposed, through meticulous documentation and photographs, the questionable transactions of Harry Shapolsky&#x27;s real-estate business between 1951 and 1971. Haacke&#x27;s solo show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which was to include this work and which made an issue of the business and personal connections of the museum&#x27;s trustees, was cancelled on the grounds of artistic impropriety by the museum&#x27;s director six weeks before the opening. (Shapolsky was not such a trustee, although some have misunderstood the affair by assuming that he was.) Curator Edward F. Fry was consequently fired for his support of the work. This cancellation is widely considered as a turning point in the relationship between artists and museums in the United States, where such cooperation became conflicted.

Following the abrupt cancellation of his exhibition and the trouble it had caused with the museum, Haacke turned to other galleries, to Europe and his native country, where his work was more often accepted. Ten years later he included the Shapolsky work—by then widely known—at his solo exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, entitled &quot;Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business&quot;.

At the John Weber gallery in New York, in 1972, on two separate occasions, Haacke created a sociological study, collecting data from gallery visitors. He requested the visitors fill out a questionnaire with 20 questions ranging from their personal demographic background information to opinions on social and political issues. The results of the questionnaires were translated into pie charts and bar graphs that were presented in the gallery at a later date. They revealed, among other things, that most visitors were related in some way to the professions of art, art teaching, and museology, and most were politically liberal.

In 1974, Haacke submitted another proposal that was subsequently rejected for an exhibition at the Wallraf–Richartz Museum in Cologne. The work described a well-documented history of the ownership (with individual biographies of each of the owners) of Manet&#x27;s painting &quot;Bunch of Asparagus&quot; in the museum&#x27;s collection, narrating how it came into the collection, and in which the Third Reich activities of its donor were revealed. Instead, the work was exhibited in the Paul Menz Gallery in Cologne with a color reproduction in place of the original.

In 1975, Haacke created a similar piece to the Manet project at the John Weber gallery in New York, exposing the history of ownership of Seurat&#x27;s &quot;Models&quot; (&quot;Les Poseuses&quot;) (small version). In the same manner as the previous installation, this work showed the increase of the value of the work as it passed from one patron to another.

Also In 1975, he created one of his most memorable installations, entitled &quot;On Social Grease&quot;. The work, which takes its title from a speech by a corporate head of one of the world&#x27;s major oil companies, is made up of carefully fractured plaques exhibiting quotes from business executives and important art world figures. These plaques display their opinions on the system of exchange between museums and businesses, speaking directly to the importance of the arts in business practices.

In 1978, Haacke had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England, that included the new work &quot;A Breed Apart&quot;, which made explicit criticism of the state-owned British Leyland for exporting vehicles for police and military use to apartheid South Africa.

His 1979 solo exhibition at Chicago&#x27;s Renaissance Society featured paintings that reproduced and altered print ads for Mobil, Allied Chemical, and Tiffany &amp; Co.

===1980s===
With extensive research Haacke continued throughout the 1980s to target corporations and museums in his work through larger scale installations and paintings. In 1982, at the documenta 7 exhibition, Haacke exhibited a very large work that included oil portraits of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in 19th-century style, facing on the opposite wall a gigantic photograph of the demonstration against nuclear arms held earlier that year—the largest demonstration in Germany since the end of the Second World War. The clear implication, supported by Haacke&#x27;s remarks, was that these two figures were attempting to roll back their respective nations to the socially and politically regressive, laissez-faire, and imperialist policies of the 19th century.

Becoming an increasingly strong critic of museums, Haacke wrote the polemical essay, &quot;Museums, Managers of Consciousness,&quot; in 1984.

In 1988 he was given an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London at which he exhibited the portrait of Margaret Thatcher, full of iconographic references featuring cameos of Maurice and Charles Saatchi. The Saatchis were well known not only as art collectors on an aggressive scale, widely affecting the course of the art world by their choices, but also as the managers of Thatcher&#x27;s successful, fear-based political campaigns as well as that of the South African premier, P. W. Botha.

===1990s===
Haacke&#x27;s controversial 1990 painting &quot;Cowboy with Cigarette&quot; turned Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Man with a Hat&quot; (1912–13) into a cigarette advertisement. The work was a reaction to the Phillip Morris company&#x27;s sponsorship of a 1989–90 exhibition about Cubism at the Museum of Modern Art.

Haacke has had solo exhibitions since, at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.

In 1993, Haacke shared, with Nam June Paik, the Golden Lion for the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Haacke&#x27;s installation &quot;Germania&quot; made explicit reference to the pavilion&#x27;s roots in the politics of Nazi Germany. Haacke tore up the floor of the German pavilion as Hitler once had done. In 1993, looking through the doors of the pavilion, past the broken floor, the viewer witnesses the word on the wall: &quot;Germania&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s name for Nazi Berlin.
===2000s===
At the 2000, Whitney Biennial, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Haacke presented a piece that is a direct reaction to art censorship. The piece called &quot;Sanitation&quot; featured six anti-art quotes from US political figures on each side of mounted American flags. The quotes were in a Gothic style script typeface once favored by Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich. On the floor was an excerpt of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression. Lined up against the wall were a dozen garbage cans with speakers emitting military marching sounds. Haacke notes that &quot;freedom of expression is the focus of the work&quot;.

===Commissions===
In 2000, the permanent installation &quot;DER BEVÖLKERUNG&quot; (&quot;To the Population&quot;) was inaugurated in the Reichstag, the German Parliament building in Berlin, and in 2006, a public commission commemorating Rosa Luxemburg was completed in a three-block area in the center of the city. In 2014, it was announced that Haacke would be installing one of his works as part of the annual Fourth Plinth commission in 2015. His winning commission of a bronze sculpture of a horse&#x27;s skeleton, titled &quot;Gift Horse&quot;, comes with an electronic ribbon tied to its front leg that displays a live ticker of prices on the London Stock Exchange.

===Use of law===

Along with Adrian Piper and Michael Asher, Haacke uses a version of Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projansky&#x27;s 1971 artist contract, The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement, in order to control the dissemination, display and ownership of his art works.

==Writing and publications==

On being considered a political artist Haacke says: &quot;it is uncomfortable for me to be a politicized artist... the work of an artist with such a label is in danger of being understood one dimensionally without exception... all artwork have a political component whether its intended or not&quot;. Jack Burnham comments on Haacke&#x27;s political growth and links its roots to exposure to a time of political unrest in the US surrounding the Vietnam War. Burnham also points to Haacke&#x27;s joining the Arts Workers Coalition and the boycott of the São Paulo Bienal in Brazil in 1969 as catalyst for the artist&#x27;s work to take a political direction. Writing by Haacke and his close friends and colleagues, including documentation of his work, are collected in two separate books by the artist.

Hans Haacke first published a book about the ideas and processes behind his and other conceptual art called &quot;Framing and Being Framed&quot;. Published in 1995, &quot;Free Exchange&quot;, is a transcription of a conversation between Haacke and Pierre Bourdieu. The two men met in the 1980s and, as Bourdieu states in the introduction, &quot;very quickly discovered how much they have in common&quot;.

<doc id="1249472" wikidata="Q15388909" url="?curid=1249472" title="Ivan the Fool (story)">
<text>&quot;Ivan the Fool&quot; (also known as &quot;Ivan the Fool and his Two Brothers&quot;) is an 1886 short story (in fact, a literary fairy tale) by Leo Tolstoy, published in 1886. The name &quot;Ivan the Fool&quot; alludes to a popular hero of Russian folklore.


==Synopsis==
It describes the struggles of three brothers and a sister, the offspring of a rich peasant, against the Old Devil:
* Simeon, a soldier
* Tarras-Briukhan or &quot;Tarras the fat belly&quot;, a merchant
* Ivan, a fool
* Martha, a mute

Simeon and Tarras leave the family farm. Simeon becomes a great soldier and marries a noble&#x27;s daughter, but despite being granted an estate and high rank, runs out of money because of his spendthrift wife. He goes home and demands a third share of his father&#x27;s wealth. His father is unwilling to do so, as Ivan and Martha are the ones who helped him prosper, but Ivan has no objection, and Simeon receives his share.

Tarras becomes a rich merchant. However, his greed drives him to also insist on his share. His father objects, but Ivan again readily agrees to his brother&#x27;s demands.

The Old Devil is greatly displeased that, due to Ivan&#x27;s generosity, there is no conflict between the brothers, so he assigns a little devil to each brother to cause trouble. Simeon&#x27;s devil fills him with excessive courage, leading to a disaster on the battlefield. For his failure, Simeon is scheduled for execution, but escapes from prison and returns home. The devil assigned to Tarras inflames his greed; he spends all of his money and borrows more to buy goods. He cannot pay back the loans, so he too flees home. Neither brother treats Ivan with any respect.

The third devil makes Ivan sick and sees to it that his plowing becomes much more difficult, but Ivan just works harder and overcomes the obstacles. Ivan discovers his little devil and is about to kill him, but the devil offers a wish in exchange for his life. Ivan wishes to be cured of his sickness. The devil heals him with a root. With that accomplished, Ivan lets the devil go, but by innocently blessing him in God&#x27;s name causes the devil to disappear. Simeon&#x27;s devil, his assigned work finished, plagues Ivan, but Ivan finds him too, and the same sort of thing happens. For sparing his life, the devil shows Ivan how to create soldiers from straw. Once again, Ivan lets him go with God&#x27;s blessing, causing the devil to vanish. The third devil suffers the same fate, after showing Ivan how to make gold using oak leaves.

Ivan invites his brothers to a feast, but they decline, so Ivan hosts the village peasants. He gives them gold coins, then creates soldiers to sing and dance for them, before turning the soldiers back into straw. When Ivan&#x27;s brothers find out what he can do, he conjures up an army for Simeon and bushels of coins for Tarras. Simeon conquers a kingdom, while Tarras has plenty of money, but they are not satisfied. They go to Ivan and demand more soldiers and gold. This time, however, Ivan refuses, as he has learned that they have caused misery with his gifts. Simeon then gives Tarras half his kingdom in exchange for half of Tarras&#x27;s gold.

One day, the Czar&#x27;s daughter becomes ill. The Czar offers a rich reward and her hand in marriage to any man who can cure her. Ivan gives his last magic healing root to an ailing old woman, but still goes to see the daughter. The instant he reaches her balcony, she is cured. They are married, and when the Czar dies, Ivan has a kingdom, just like his brothers.

Simeon is feared by all, while Tarras still collects taxes, despite having more money than he needs. Ivan, on the other hand, does not enjoy being a ruler. He sends for his parents and sister and resumes his old life. His wife, after thinking it over, joins him.

The Old Devil becomes impatient, waiting for his little devils to return, and sets out to do their job himself. He shows Simeon how to strengthen his army. Simeon conquers a neighboring country, but when he attacks India, he is defeated. The Old Devil then sets up as a merchant in Tarras&#x27;s kingdom. He pays more than Tarras for workers and goods, no matter how much Tarras offers, so Tarras&#x27;s money is useless.

The Old Devil goes to Ivan disguised as a General and offers to form a powerful army from his subjects. Ivan does not object, but his people are not interested, and Ivan does not force them to enlist. The Old Devil then incites the ruler of another country to invade, but Ivan&#x27;s people are fools like him (the wise having fled Ivan&#x27;s rule) and treat the invaders so well that the soldiers all desert. The Old Devil then transforms himself into a nobleman and offers to build Ivan a palace and factories. At first, the people work for him, but once they have enough gold, they stop. They will not even sell him any food. He then spends days talking to the people, to instruct them on how to use their brains rather than their hands to do their work, but they are unimpressed. When he becomes faint from hunger, he asks for bread. They laugh at him, and he collapses. Defeated, he disappears through a hole in the ground.

==Analysis==
Although the story is usually considered a children&#x27;s fairy tale, it is also used as an indication of Tolstoy&#x27;s political leanings in support of Christianity. Though his brothers are easily tempted by money and military power, unsophisticated Ivan, with his simple way of life, defeats the treacherous devil. Ivan eventually becomes the ruler of the country despite the lack of a standing army or currency. All of the citizens are welcome at Ivan&#x27;s table, where workers are fed first and intellectuals (those without calluses on their hands) have to eat the leftovers.

<text>Thea Christiansen Foss (8 June 1858 – 7 June 1927) was the founder of Foss Maritime, the largest tugboat company in the western United States. She was the real-life person on which the fictional character &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (originally portrayed on film in 1933 by Marie Dressler) may have been very loosely based.

==Biography==

Thea Christiansen was born on June 8, 1858, in the village of Eidsberg, Østfold, Norway. She moved to Kristiania (Oslo from 1926) when she was 14 where she met her sister&#x27;s brother-in-law, Andreas Olsen, a ship&#x27;s carpenter. Olsen immigrated to America to earn money to pay for Thea&#x27;s passage. She arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1881 where the two were married. They lived in St. Paul for eight years and had four children. Andreas changed his first name to Andrew and their last name to Fossen to distinguish themselves from the many other Olesons in the area. Fossen, meaning waterfall, was later shortened to Foss. Andrew Fossen moved to Tacoma, Washington in 1888, what was then known as Washington Territory. Thea and their children joined him in the spring of 1889, after the birth of their third child.Andrew built a float house on the Tacoma waterfront for the family to settle. 

Thea Foss launched the future tugboat firm on the Tacoma waterfront in the summer of 1889. She started the Foss Launch Company, when she began fixing up rowboats to sell. Thea started with one and sold it for $5; then she was able to buy another, and continue to do so. Andrew ended up building rowboats and their home became Foss Boathouse. The business grew, expanding into other areas such as towing, and hauling lumber. The company eventually became the Seattle-based Foss Maritime Company.

Thea Foss died in Tacoma on the day before her 69th birthday.

==Legacy==

<text>Meir is the main shopping street in Antwerp, Belgium. It is the most important shopping area in the country, both by number of shoppers and by rent prices. The street has been mostly pedestrianised since 1993 and is said to be the Belgian equivalent to New York&#x27;s 5th Avenue.

In the centre of Antwerp, Meir connects the Antwerp City Hall with the trains at Antwerp Central Station.

Between 2002 and 2004, it was the most expensive shopping street in the Benelux. Since the opening of the historic Stadsfeestzaal shopping centre in 2007, Meir regained that position. It has the highest rents of any street in Belgium, at 1,700 €/square metre/year.

The name comes from the old Dutch word &quot;meere&quot; (lake). Meir used to be a so-called &quot;wood lake&quot; (&quot;houtmeer&quot;), where wood destined for use in furniture would be kept wet for a time.
==Historical buildings==
* Meir 50: Royal Residence, built in 1745, served as the Antwerp residence of the Kings of Belgium.
* Meir 85: Osterrieth House, built in 1746 in full rococo style.

==Surroundings==

* Bourla Theatre, Neoclassical theatre built in 1827 and 1834 by architect Pierre Bruno Bourla.
* Antwerp Central Station, completed 1905 in an eclectic style.

<doc id="1249476" wikidata="Q201086" url="?curid=1249476" title="Antártica Chilena Province">
<text>Antártica Chilena Province () is the southernmost of the four provinces in Chile&#x27;s southernmost region, Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region (XII). The capital is Puerto Williams. The province comprises the extreme southern part of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (south of the Cordillera Darwin), the islands south and west of Isla Grande (Diego Ramírez Islands), and Chile&#x27;s claims in Antarctica. The province is administratively divided into two communes (&quot;comunas&quot;): Cabo de Hornos, located at the southern tip of South America, and Antártica, a wedge-shaped claim of Antarctica, which is not internationally recognized. Its total area of makes it almost twice as large as all other provinces of Chile combined.

==Communes==
# Commune of Cabo de Hornos (until 2001 called Navarino, capital Puerto Williams), area , population as of census 2002: 2,262, of which 1,952 are in the capital. As a commune, Cabo de Hornos is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016-2020 alcalde is Patricio Fernández (PDC).The communal council has the following members:

Daniel Fernando Valdebenito Contreras (PS) Ángela Barría Barrientos (RN) Juan Velásquez (PS) Carolina Guenel González (DC) Francis Delgado Ibaceta (RN) Paola Speake Ojeda (DC)
# Commune of Antártica, area , population as of census 2002: 130. This territory as a whole is not recognized internationally. (&quot;See&quot; Antarctic territorial claims.)

The Municipality of Cabo de Hornos governs both Antártica and Cabo de Hornos from Cabo de Hornos, making it the only Chilean municipality to currently administer more than one commune.

==Demography==
According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (&quot;INE&quot;), it had a population of 2,392 inhabitants (1,518 men and 874 women), giving it a population density of . Of these, 1,952 (81.6%) lived in urban areas and 440 (18.4%) in rural areas. The province is the largest in Chile, yet it is also the least and most sparsely populated province in the country. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 23% (447 persons).

== Territory recognition ==
The South American portion of the territory is internationally recognized as part of Chile. However, the Commune of Antártica, which encompasses most of the area of the province, is disputed. It forms the Chilean claim to Antarctica, stretching south of the 60th parallel to the South Pole. This region of Antarctica claimed by Chile overlaps with land claims by Argentina and the United Kingdom.

The Commune of Antártica is practically uninhabited except for research stations of various countries, although Chile maintains a permanent civilian population at Villa Las Estrellas (near Frei Montalva Station), including women and children, a small school, and even a bank, in order to support its territorial claim of the area. The official population for the area as of the census 2002 is 130 (115 male, 15 female). This does not include the staff of non-Chilean bases in the area.

According to the Chilean argument, its claim to Antártica Chilena is as old as Chile itself. The Tordesillas Line established a west–east division of colonial territories between Portugal and Spain. On the first organization of the new conquered territories, Charles V, ruler of the Spanish Empire assigned to Pedro Sancho de la Hoz control over Terra Australis, which included the Southern part of South America, Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, and all southern undiscovered territories (Terra Australis Ignota). This eventually merged with other territories in the Captaincy General of the Kingdom of Chile.

==Prehistory==
Early settlement by prehistoric man is known to have occurred from archaeological recovery within this Province. Yaghans established many settlements on the islands of the present day province of the Antártica espana Province; for example, there is a significant early Yaghan archaeological site at Wulaia Bay, which C. Michael Hogan terms the &quot;Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens&quot;.

==History==
Puerto Williams and Porvenir were established in the late 19th century, mainly by Western European immigrants (esp. from British Isles, Scandinavia and the former Yugoslavia) and navigators in cruise ships and fish boats. The Chilean government transplanted Chilean settlers from the central part of the country in the 20th century to increase the province&#x27;s sparse population.

<text>WLWT (channel 5) is a television station in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Hearst Television. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Young Street, and its transmitter is located on Chickasaw Street, both in the Mount Auburn neighborhood of Cincinnati.

==History==

===The Crosley/Avco years===
WLWT was established by the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation, owners of WLW (700 AM), one of the United States&#x27; most powerful radio stations. Crosley Broadcasting was a subsidiary of the Crosley Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the Aviation Corporation (later known as Avco) in 1945. After starting experimental broadcasts in 1946 as W8XCT on channel 1, the station began commercial broadcasts on February 9, 1948, on VHF channel 4, making it Cincinnati&#x27;s first television station and Ohio&#x27;s second (after WEWS, Cleveland). The station&#x27;s studios were housed with WLW in the Crosley Square building, a converted Elks lodge in downtown Cincinnati.
WLWT counts itself as the first television station outside the Eastern U.S. (other than network-owned stations) to become a primary NBC television affiliate, but originally carried programming from all the major television networks of the time: NBC, ABC, CBS and DuMont. WLWT later affiliated exclusively with NBC in 1949, after WKRC-TV (originally on channel 11, now on channel 12) and WCPO-TV (originally on channel 7, now on channel 9) signed on during that year. Following the release of the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; in 1952, all of Cincinnati&#x27;s VHF stations changed channels. WLWT was reassigned to channel 5, as the previous channel 4 allocation was shifted north to Columbus and given to sister station WLWC (now WCMH-TV), which began operations in April 1949.

In addition to WLWT and WLWC, Crosley also operated stations in nearby markets, WLWD (channel 2, now WDTN) in Dayton, which signed-on in March 1949; and WLWI (channel 13, now WTHR) in Indianapolis, which opened in October 1957. These four inter-connected stations were branded on-air as the &quot;WLW Network&quot;, and their call letters were stylized with hyphens to further reflect their connections to each other—the Cincinnati station, the group&#x27;s flagship, was known as &quot;WLW-T&quot;. Crosley also owned WLWA (now WXIA-TV) in Atlanta (purchased in 1953 and sold in 1962) and WOAI-TV in San Antonio (acquired in 1965, sold in 1974).

The three WLW television stations in Ohio were NBC affiliates, and carried common programming along with WLWI in Indianapolis (an ABC affiliate). Most of these shows were produced at the WLWT studios on Crosley Square, and included &quot;The Ruth Lyons 50-50 Club&quot; (later hosted by Bob Braun after Lyons&#x27; retirement in 1967), the &quot;Paul Dixon Show&quot; and &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;; some of these programs were syndicated regionally to other stations outside of the Crosley group.

In 1957, WLWT became the first station in the Cincinnati market to begin color television broadcasts. It later became the first station in the nation to broadcast entirely in color, giving Cincinnati the nickname &quot;Colortown U.S.A.&quot; by 1962. For a period during the 1970s, the station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;5, The Originator&quot;, in reference to all of the local programming that was produced by the station.

The Crosley broadcast division took the name of its parent company in 1968, becoming Avco Broadcasting Corporation. In 1969, the FCC enacted its &quot;one-to-a-market&quot; rule, which enforced a ban on common ownership of AM radio stations and television stations with overlapping coverage areas under certain conditions while grandfathering some already existing instances. Avco&#x27;s ownership of WLW radio (a 50,000-watt, clear-channel station) and WLWT, and the Columbus, Dayton and Indianapolis television stations was initially protected under the new rule. While WLWT&#x27;s channel 5 potential coverage area covered a large amount of the Dayton and Columbus markets, the station was forced by the FCC to transmit with a shorter broadcast tower, thus reducing the signal overlap between WLWT, WLWC, and WLWD.

===Later years===
In the mid-1970s, Avco decided to exit broadcasting and sold all of its stations to separate buyers. WLWT was the next to last to be sold, going to Multimedia, Inc. in March 1976. As a result, the stations all lost their grandfathered protection, which led to an ownership conflict situation which Hearst-Argyle (predecessor to today&#x27;s Hearst Television) would encounter two decades later (the FCC has since relaxed its adjacent-market ownership rules). All of the &quot;WLW Network&quot; TV stations except for flagship WLWT would change their call signs, leaving WLWT as the only one with any physical evidence that it was connected to WLW radio, a station that ironically would be a sister station to WLWT&#x27;s rival WKRC-TV years later. Multimedia would later acquire Avco Program Sales and with it, the regional syndication rights to Braun&#x27;s program, along with &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;; the resulting subsidiary, Multimedia Entertainment, was initially based at WLWT.

In July 1995, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Multimedia. Once the deal was approved in November of that year, the FCC ruled that Gannett would have to divest WLWT, WMAZ-TV in Macon, Georgia, and KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, due to ownership restrictions; Gannett ultimately retained ownership of WMAZ-TV after the FCC allowed companies to own more television stations. As Gannett had owned &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; since 1979 (and remains the newspaper&#x27;s owner to this day) and had recently acquired Oklahoma City-based cable provider Multimedia Cablevision, the company had to obtain a temporary waiver of an FCC cross-ownership rule which prohibited common ownership of a television station and a newspaper or a cable television provider in the same market in order for Gannett to close on the Multimedia group. When the waiver expired in December 1996, Gannett opted to keep the &quot;Enquirer&quot; (as well as sister newspaper &quot;The Niagara Gazette&quot;, which would later be sold) and swap WLWT and KOCO-TV to Argyle Television Holdings II in exchange for WGRZ in Buffalo, New York and WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a deal which was finalized in January 1997.

Argyle merged with the broadcasting unit of the Hearst Corporation to form Hearst-Argyle Television in August 1997. Hearst had owned WDTN (the former WLWD) since 1981, but was not allowed to keep both stations due to a since-repealed FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of stations with overlapping city-grade signals. In 1998, Hearst traded WDTN and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island to Sunrise Television in exchange for KSBW in Salinas, California, WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, and WNNE in Hartford, Vermont. WLWT&#x27;s licensee name under Multimedia and Gannett ownership, &quot;Multimedia Entertainment, Inc.&quot;, survives to this day as the licensee name for WGRZ. In June 1996, WKRC-TV and WCPO-TV traded networks, leaving WLWT as the only Cincinnati television station to never change its affiliation. Additionally, the purchase by Hearst made WLWT sister stations with Hearst flagship stations WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh and WBAL-TV in Baltimore, leading to all three stations to have a friendly rivalry with each other during the NFL season, as all three local NFL teams (Cincinnati Bengals, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens) are division rivals in the AFC North.

WLWT briefly aired UPN programming as a secondary affiliation during the early morning hours on weekends at certain points in 1998 (the network was then limited to a six-hour weekly schedule), after that netlet was displaced from its previous affiliate WSTR-TV (channel 64) by The WB. The expected lower ratings in a late night time slot on WLWT (along with low promotion of UPN programming outside of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;) saw UPN capitulate and affiliate with former WB affiliate WBQC-CA (channel 25) in September 1998 as the network expanded to a ten-hour schedule that month which would have likely seen program rejections from WLWT due to lack of schedule room.

In June 1999, WLWT moved its studios from Crosley Square to the Mount Auburn neighborhood, in a building that once served as the corporate headquarters of WKRC-TV&#x27;s founding owners Taft Broadcasting. This is because after abandoning local non-news program production, the station found that Crosley Square, with its two-story ballrooms and basement newsroom, was built more for live entertainment broadcasts than a news operation.
In June 2007, WLWT announced that it would partner with WLW (AM) to provide news and weather for the radio station. As a consequence, WLWT&#x27;s news and weather updates were heard nationwide on WLW&#x27;s XM Satellite Radio channel, at channel 173; the agreement with XM ended in the summer of 2008. WLWT and WLW shared news and weather operations for years while both were owned by Crosley Broadcasting, but eventual separate ownerships of the two stations (WLWT to Argyle, then Hearst Television; WLW to Clear Channel) led to WLW radio using the resources of WKRC-TV for several years until the renewed partnership with its former television sister. The modern WLW-WLWT partnership ended on March 31, 2010; WLWT currently provides news and weather to several Cincinnati radio stations.

The transmission tower seen at the beginning of the 1978–1982 CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; actually belonged to WLWT—it was located at the WLWT transmitter at 2222 Chickasaw Street. That red and white tower stood side by side with WLWT&#x27;s current strobed tower until 2005, when it was dismantled.

On July 9, 2012, WLWT&#x27;s parent company Hearst Television was involved in a dispute with Time Warner Cable, leading to WLWT being pulled from Time Warner Cable and temporarily replaced with Nexstar Broadcasting Group station WTWO in Terre Haute, Indiana; Time Warner opted for such a distant signal like WTWO, as it does not have the rights to carry any NBC affiliate closest to them. The substitution of WTWO in place of WLWT lasted until July 19, 2012, when a carriage deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner.

In 2014, the station aired a &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game from NFL Network (produced by CBS Sports) in lieu of CBS affiliate WKRC-TV, who exercised their option of the right of first refusal. The station today airs up to four Cincinnati Bengals games a year, usually as part of &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; or ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (WLWT parent Hearst holds a 20 percent interest in the ESPN joint venture with Disney). The latter (if not a national simulcast on ABC through WCPO-TV) means a delay of &quot;The Voice&quot; to overnight hours, with voting limited to the internet during the program&#x27;s normal timeslot.

==Programming==
WLWT clears most of the NBC programming schedule. However, the station airs the network&#x27;s Saturday lineup out of pattern. WLWT delays NBC&#x27;s educational block, &quot;The More You Know&quot;, by one hour due to a 10 a.m. newscast. The station also airs the Saturday edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; on a half-hour tape delay at 7 p.m. due to an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast.

===Sports coverage===
====Cincinnati Reds====

The Cincinnati Reds baseball team, also owned by Crosley until 1961, broadcast its games over WLWT from 1947 through 1995. The station also fed the games to a network of stations that covered Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, and Tennessee (and included some of its Crosley-owned sister stations). It continued originating Reds games long after most &quot;Big Three&quot; stations dropped local sports programming. The station also aired any nationally televised Reds games through NBC&#x27;s MLB broadcast contract from its 1948 sign-on until 1989, including their back-to-back World Series titles in 1975 and 1976.

Waite Hoyt was the original play-by-play announcer on WLWT, in a simulcast with WLW Radio. George Bryson Sr. replaced him in 1956. When Ed Kennedy became the play-by-play announcer in 1961, he would remain for 11 seasons, working with Frank McCormick for eight seasons. Also calling games on WLWT were Ken Wilson, Charlie Jones, Bill Brown,
Ray Lane, Johnny Bench, and Joe Morgan.

Citing economic reasons along with declining ratings and pressure from NBC, WLWT did not renew its contract following the 1995 season.

WLWT returned to broadcasting Reds games in 2024, albeit only the Opening Day game, in a simulcast with Bally Sports Ohio.

====Cincinnati Bengals====
In 1968, when the Cincinnati Bengals were enfranchised by the American Football League, channel 5 became the station of record for the team as Avco acquired broadcast rights to the team&#x27;s preseason games, which were also distributed to Dayton, Columbus, and Indianapolis. WLWT would also carry most regular-season Bengals games through NBC&#x27;s contracts with the AFL and the National Football League through the end of the 1997 season, when NBC lost its broadcast rights to the American Football Conference to CBS. In the present-day WLWT airs Bengals games when they are featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; as well as ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, a benefit of WLWT owner Hearst&#x27;s 20 percent stake in the sports network. The station has aired the Bengals&#x27; appearances in Super Bowls XXIII and LVI.

===News operation===
WLWT presently broadcasts 42 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays). , WLWT generally had the third-rated local newscasts in the Cincinnati market; however, it has been showing steady ratings growth in its newscasts in recent years. WLWT now places #1 or #2 in all newscasts in the key adult demographics. It was the number one rated newscast in the city for several years when Jerry Springer served as anchorperson.

On April 20, 2013, WLWT became the fourth and final Cincinnati television station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Prior to the upgrade, its newscasts aired in 16:9 widescreen standard definition. With the switch to HD, WLWT debuted a new set.

In the mid-2000s through the early 2010s, the station maintained a weather beacon atop the Radisson Hotel in Covington dubbed the &quot;Weather Lights&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

NBC Weather Plus ceased network operations in late 2008; however, WLWT continued to broadcast local weather programming as &quot;News 5 Weather Plus&quot; on its digital subchannel until June 30, 2011. The subchannel switched to MeTV on July 1, 2011.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WLWT discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 5.

As part of the SAFER Act or called by most &quot;Nightlight&quot; service of 30 days past the DTV transition date, WLWT kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<text>High Island is a small, uninhabited, privately-owned island, part of the Pelham Islands in the Bronx, New York City. It lies east of the north end of City Island between City Island Harbor and Pelham Bay in Long Island Sound. It is connected to City Island by a sandbar that emerges at very low tide, as well as by a small private bridge.

Previously used as a stone quarry and then a summer resort, the island today is used to support two radio station transmitters and antennas.

==History==
High Island was once known as Shark Island due to the many sand sharks which used to swim in the nearby waters of Pelham Bay. The island is comparatively high with a shape similar to a gumdrop, thus alluding to the origin of its present-day name.

Elisha King purchased the island in 1829 to quarry stones.
During the 1920s the Miller family operated a community of summer rental cottages catering to about 40 families.

In October 1960, the National Broadcasting Company purchased the island and acquired its deed, with plans to construct a radio transmission tower. CBS later purchased half of NBC&#x27;s interest, creating a joint venture. After over two years of construction, the new tower and supporting structures housing the transmitters for WNBC (660 AM) and WCBS (880 AM) went into operation in 1963. Prior to High Island the WCBS facility was located on nearby Columbia Island in New Rochelle, New York, and the WNBC transmitter was based in Sands Point, New York.

On August 27, 1967, a small private airplane crashed into the radio tower, destroying the antenna and taking WCBS and WNBC off the air, the day before WCBS&#x27;s all news format launched. Both stations were able to borrow nearby transmission facilities for about a week, until an emergency tower could be erected on High Island. The permanent replacement was built with a second (shorter) tower as an emergency backup.

The deed to High Island remained with NBC until 1988, when it was transferred to Emmis Communications as part of the latter company&#x27;s purchase of WNBC. Emmis owned WFAN, an existing station which moved to WNBC&#x27;s frequency in October 1988. WFAN was sold by Emmis in 1992 to Infinity Broadcasting, while CBS and WCBS were acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1995. WCBS and WFAN became sister stations in 1997 when Infinity was purchased by Westinghouse.

In August 2024, WCBS changed its call letters to WHSQ after Good Karma Brands took over operational control of 880 AM, replacing WCBS&#x27;s news format with ESPN Radio sports programming.

==Current use==
, the entire island and two transmitters are owned by Audacy, Inc., which through several acquisitions and mergers has owned both WFAN and WCBS (now WHSQ) since 2017.

The taller of the towers is . The shorter tower is and was built in 2001 to replace the emergency tower erected in 1967. The proximity of these two AM radio stations has, at times, caused interference on telephones and electronic equipment on nearby City Island. High Island is only an AM radio transmission facility. It does not have any studios or tower tenants, other than the two AM radio stations. WFAN broadcasts from studios located at the Hudson Square Broadcast Center in the Tribeca section of Manhattan, while WHSQ broadcasts from ABC&#x27;s facilities on the Upper West Side. WHSQ is scheduled to move into new studios in Hudson Square, as part of the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s relocation of its New York operations to that area in early 2025. Disney is the corporate parent of ESPN and ABC; Good Karma operates ESPN Radio under license from Disney.

A full-time caretaker&#x27;s residence was in use from 1961 to 2007. The island is currently uninhabited and maintained by the radio stations&#x27; engineers and contractors. Advances in broadcast and security technology have made remote monitoring of both the radio equipment and the physical property more feasible than in earlier years where a full-time human presence was required.

<doc id="1249488" wikidata="Q6414553" url="?curid=1249488" title="Kip Water, Inverclyde">
<text>Kip Water, also known as the River Kip, is a short river in Inverclyde, Scotland which gives the village of Inverkip its name (Inverkip = mouth of the River Kip). It originates at Cornalees in the hills between Inverkip and Greenock and runs through Shielhill Glen, Dunrod Glen and the Kip Valley before entering the Firth of Clyde at Kip Marina in Inverkip.

== History ==
John Ainslie&#x27;s 1800 map of the County of Renfrew shows the upper reaches of the River named &quot;Shaws Burn&quot; and the lower reaches at Ardgowan Policies named &quot;Ardgowan Water&quot;. This was before the construction of Shaws Water Scheme, which opened in 1827 and modified the source of the river.

John Thomson&#x27;s 1832 map also shows the upper reaches named &quot;Shaws Burn&quot;, with the lower reaches named &quot;Ardgowan or Kipp Water&quot; (note the double &#x27;p&#x27;). It is not clear when the name &quot;Kip Water&quot; was formally adopted for the entire length of the river.

===Present Course===
The present source of the river is Compensation Reservoir at Cornalees Bridge from where it drops steeply down Shielhill Glen to Millhouse, where it passes under the so-called &#x27;Roman Bridge&#x27;. At this point the river enters Dunrod Glen where it runs around three sides of Idzholm Hill, here it is joined by the Spango Burn before entering the Kip Valley. The final stretch of the river from Bankfoot Farm to the Clyde is fairly flat and has been altered over the years by the addition of several small weirs.

===Past Industry===
The Aislie and Thomson maps referenced above show mills, including a waulkmill, at what is now Ardgowan Policies. Little or no trace of these mills survives today. It is also likely that there was a mill further upstream at Millhouse, based on the name of the house.

Three sandstone quarries were active at the top of Shielhill Glen in the late 19thC. These were served by a railway line which left the main line at Dunrod Farm. The line of the railway can still be clearly seen along most of the route.

===Present Industry===
Other than the workshops at Kip Marina, there is no industry on the river at the time of writing in May 2018.

===Future Industry===
Plans have been approved for the construction of a distillery at Bankfoot Farm by Ardgowan Distillery. The planned distillery will take water from the river for process and cooling purposes. It will also take water from some adjacent springs. At the time of writing (May 2018) no opening date for the distillery has been confirmed.

== Bridges ==
There are several extant bridges across the river, the highest upstream being Cornalees Bridge which crosses the waterfall as the river exits Compensation Reservoir. This is a late 20thC concrete and steel construction which carries a minor road over the river. A few hundred metres downstream is a wooden footbridge which is part of the Cornalees nature trail.

There are traces of a bridge at the site of the disused sandstone quarries near the top of Shielhill Glen. Slightly downstream from this, the sandstone abutments and piers of a three span former railway bridge can be seen at Majeston Farm . This carried a short lived mineral line from Dunrod to the sandstone quarries in the late 19thC. A wooden farm bridge also crosses the river at this point.

Millhouse Road crosses the river on a stone arched bridge, from which can be seen the impressive single span of the &#x27;Roman Bridge&#x27; in the private grounds of Millhouse. Just downstream from Millhouse is a sandstone and steel railway viaduct which carries the existing Glasgow to Wemyss Bay line. Parallel to this viaduct can be seen the piers of a second viaduct which was removed in the late 1960s.

A steel and timber bridge crosses at Bankfoot Farm. The remains of a further small bridge can be seen between Bankfoot and Bridgend. At Bridgend, there are two parallel bridges, one of which is disused, having been replaced when the A78 road was realigned in the early 1970s. Between this bridge and Kip Marina there is a dilapidated farm track bridge leading from Ardgowan Policies to Swallow Brae plantation. At Kip Marina there are two more parallel bridges, one of which is now a footpath only and which served Ardgowan House. This was replaced by a new concrete bridge in 2006 when Kip Marina Village was constructed. The final bridge is the pontoon bridge within Kip Marina.

==Kip Marina==

The marina, which stands at the confluence of the Kip and the Clyde, also takes its name from the river. Scotland&#x27;s first marina, it opened with 250 berths in 1971 and was one of only three in the UK at that time. It has expanded considerably since then and now (2018) has over 600 berths.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Kip Marina Village ==

A recently built (2000s) housing estate, located adjacent to the marina. It stands on three sides of the marina, giving most of the houses marina views, with some also enjoying uninterrupted views of the Firth of Clyde. Kip Marina Village is considered part of Inverkip, but is physically separated from the main village by the busy A78 Main Road. A footbridge provides access from the centre of Inverkip to the marina and Kip Marina Village.

<text>A kip is a US customary unit of force. It equals 1000 pounds-force, and is used primarily by structural engineers to indicate forces where the value represented in pound-force is inefficient. Although uncommon, it is occasionally also considered a unit of mass, equal to 1000 pounds (i.e. one half of a short ton). Another use is as a unit of deadweight to compute shipping charges. 

:1 kip ≈ = 

The name comes from combining the words &quot;kilo&quot; and &quot;pound&quot;; it is occasionally called a kilopound. Its symbol is kip, sometimes K (upper or lowercase), or less frequently, klb. When it is necessary to clearly distinguish it as a unit of force rather than mass, it is sometimes called the &quot;kip-force&quot; (symbol kipf or klbf).

The symbol kp usually stands for the &quot;kilopond&quot;, a unit of force, or kilogram-force, used primarily in Europe prior to the introduction of SI units.

The kip is also the name of a unit of mass equal to approximately 9.19 kilograms. This usage is obsolete, and was used in Malaysia.

<text>The Trondheim Region () is a statistical metropolitan region in the county of Trøndelag in Norway. It is centered in the city of Trondheim.


The new limited-access road to Orkdal Municipality, a part of European route E39, was completed on 30 June 2005, shortening the driving time between Trondheim and Orkanger with some 15 minutes, adding Orkdal to the region.

Although rarer, there is also some commuting from Rennebu Municipality, Levanger Municipality, and Frosta Municipality.

<text>Philip Humphrey Vellacott (16 January 1907 – 24 August 1997) was an English classical scholar, known for his numerous translations of Greek tragedy.

He was born at Grays, Essex and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a double first in the Classics Tripos.

During the 1930s, Vellacott taught at Liverpool University, and schools including Dulwich College, London. He carried on teaching through the Second World War, as he was a conscientious objector. It was during his time as a teacher that he completed most of his Penguin Books classical translations centred on the works of Aeschylus, Euripides and Theophrastus.

Vellacott lectured on Greek drama on four tours in the US and spent time as a visiting lecturer at the University of California at Santa Cruz. He retired in 1967 to Radnorshire, where he carried on writing until his death in 1997.

In 1939 he married Nancy Agnew. The artist Elisabeth Vellacott was his sister.

<text>Henry O. Foss (September 5, 1891 – April 1986) was an elected official, businessman and civic leader in Tacoma, Washington. 
It is after his mother that the famed &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; series was written. Henry Foss High School in Tacoma, Washington is named after him.

==Biography==
Foss was one of four children born to Norwegian immigrant parents, Andrew and Thea Foss, first owners and operators of Foss Launch and Tug Company. He graduated from Tacoma (now Stadium) High School in 1911 and went to work for his parents in the family business. He graduated from Stanford University in 1916.

Foss piloted newly built ships for launching during World War I as the skipper of the tugboat &quot;Foss-Berg&quot;. During World War II, Foss was on active duty with the US Navy in naval intelligence. He served at the Naval Salvage School in New York, and became deputy fleet salvage officer with Commander Service Force South Pacific at Pearl Harbor. He retired with the rank of rear admiral and was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Navy Marine Lifesaving Medal.

While serving in the Pacific, he bunked with future United States president Richard Nixon, who gave Foss the nickname &quot;Falcon&quot; for his ability to locate poker games on different ships. &quot;Falcons&quot; eventually became the nickname for the Henry Foss High School sports teams.

From 1930 to 1934, he served as state senator from the 26th District, was Pierce County Republican chairman from 1932 to 1934, and later served as commissioner for the Port of Tacoma. He was director of Pacific National Bank of Washington and in 1962 was elected as the bank&#x27;s first honorary director, serving until he retired in 1971.

<text>Joshimath, also known as Jyotirmath, is a town and a municipal board in Chamoli District in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Located at a height of 6,150 feet (1,875 m), it is a gateway to several Himalayan mountain climbing expeditions, trekking trails and pilgrim centres like Badrinath. It is home to one of the four cardinal &quot;pītha&quot;s established by Adi Shankara.

Since 7 February 2021, the area was severely affected by the 2021 Uttarakhand flood and its aftermath. The town is confirmed to be sinking due to its geographic location being along a running ridge.

==History==
Between the 7th and 11th centuries C.E., Katyuri kings ruled the area of varying extent from their capital at &quot;Katyur&quot; (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon. The Katyuri dynasty was founded by Vashudev Katyuri. The ancient Basdeo temple at Joshimath is attributed to Vasu Dev. Vasu Dev was of Buddhist origin, but later followed Brahminical practices and the brahminical practices of Katyuri kings in general is sometimes attributed to a vigorous campaign of Adi Shankara (788-820 CE).

According to Badri Datt Pandey in his book &quot;Kumaon Ka Itihas&quot;, Joshimath was the original capital of the Katyur dynasty before it moved to Kartikeyapur (modern day Baijnath). According to the story, king Vasudev was a devotee of Narsingh (avatar of lord Vishnu). One day he went hunting and lord Narsingh came to his home disguised. His wife offered food to the god. After eating the food the god went in the king&#x27;s room for some rest. When the king returned from hunting he got angry after seeing a man sleeping in his bed. He took his sword and cut the left hand of god. Instead of blood, milk started flowing from the wound. After seeing this, the king realised the disguised person was not a common man. He asked for forgiveness from the god. The god said he came because he was happy with his kingdom but after this incident he cursed the king to move to a new location (Baijnath). Because of this wound, the statue in the temple will also have a weak left hand. When the statue&#x27;s hand will fall off, this will be the end of his dynasty.

Katyuri kings were displaced by the Panwar dynasty in the 11th century AD.

==2021 glacial outburst flood and aftermath==

A part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Nanda Devi National Park in Uttarakhand&#x27;s Chamoli district on 7 February 2021, causing flash flood in Rishiganga and Dhauliganga River, devastating among others the village Rini, the Dhauliganga Dam, the Rishi Ganga dam, Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant, killing and endangering people. According to media, at least 31 people were confirmed to have been killed and around 165 were reported missing after the flash flood. A PTI report put the number of workers missing at 150.

In the aftermath of the floods, residents began noticing cracks in homes; eventually over 600 houses were evacuated after a local temple collapsed. Eventually over 700 of approximately 4,400-4,600 structures would show cracking and the streets and paved areas in the affected area also showed cracking. Hundreds of residents were able to evacuate and authorities classified zones within the town as &quot;danger&quot;, &quot;buffer&quot; and &quot;completely safe&quot; areas; demolition work began on 9 January 2023.

A two year study released in 2023 by the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing used satellite sensing to determine the area was sinking each year.

<doc id="1249503" wikidata="Q1726607" url="?curid=1249503" title="Swedish History Museum">
<text>The Swedish History Museum () is a museum located in Stockholm, Sweden, that covers Swedish archaeology and cultural history from the Mesolithic period to present day. Founded in 1866, it operates as a government agency and is tasked with preserving Swedish historical items as well as making knowledge about history available to the public.

The origin of the museum is the collections of art and historical objects gathered by Swedish monarchs since the 16th century. It has a number of permanent exhibitions and annually hosts special exhibitions tied to current events.

== Function ==
The History Museum is part of a central museum agency called the &quot;Statens historiska museer&quot; (SHM) (&quot;National Historical Museums&quot;). Other museums under the aegis of this agency are The Royal Armouries, The Economy Museum, Skokloster Castle, The Hallwyl Museum, The Tumba Papermill Museum and The Swedish Holocaust Museum.

== History ==
The foundation for what was to become the Swedish History Museum and the Nationalmuseum, was King Gustav Vasa&#x27;s 16th century art collection at Gripsholm Castle. The collection grew through acquisitions, gifts and spoils of war during the time of the Swedish Empire. Some of the collections were lost during the fire in the Tre Kronor castle. During the later part of the 18th century, art and antiquities were bought by ambassadors and members of the royal family and collected at Stockholm Palace. After the death of King Gustaf III in 1792, the collections were turned over to the Swedish government. That same year the Royal Museum (&quot;Kongl. Museum&quot;) opened in the palace. It was one of the first public museums in the world. In 1846–47, the museum moved from the palace to the Ridderstolpe House at Skeppsbron where it resided until 1865 and the move to Nationalmuseum. Swedish archaeologist Stig Welinder argues that the History Museum was in fact founded with its establishment in the Ridderstolpe House in 1847.

The present-day museum was founded in 1866 by Bror Emil Hildebrand, who had been director of its predecessor both at Stockholm Palace and Ridderstolpe House. The collections of the museum were exhibited on the ground floor of the recently built Nationalmuseum. The premises soon became too small for both museums. When plans for the new Nordic Museum building were made in 1876, it was suggested that the building should also include the History Museum&#x27;s collections. The debate about housing for the History Museum continued for decades until Sigurd Curman became Custodian of Ancient Monuments (&quot;riksantikvarie&quot;) and head of the Swedish National Heritage Board on 3July 1923. He moved the issue forward to a more concrete and permanent solution. The main objective for a new and sufficiently large building for the museum was to bring order to the collections, commonly called &quot;The Chaos&quot; while the unpublished research papers were referred to as &quot;the corf&quot;.

In 1929, the Swedish government suggested that the former military barracks and stables at Storgatan in the city block known as the &quot;Krubban&quot; (&quot;the crib&quot;), could be allocated to the museum. An architectural competition was held in 1930, for the proposed conversion of the block into suitable accommodation for the museum. No winner was declared, instead it was elements from the runner-up suggestion, made by architects Bengt Romare and George Scherman with engineer Gösta Nilsson, that became the starting point for the remodeling of the area. They developed the design for the new museum in cooperation with Curman, the National Property Board and the National Heritage Board.

== Architecture ==

In 1932, the Swedish government granted funds for construction of official buildings to create jobs during the depression. Some of these were used to build the museum in 1934–39. The plans for the museum were not finalized until 1936.

=== Exterior ===
The main building, designed by Romare and Scherman 1935–1940, reflects an ambivalence between the predominant modern style of the era and the historical context given not only by the context requirements, but also the 19th century barracks and stables south of the museum designed by Fredrik Blom and built in stages in 1805–1818, starting one year after the land had been appropriated by the government. The barracks are neoclassicist in style and the repetitive façades used to be exposed to Ladugårdslandsviken that was part of Stockholm&#x27;s main harbor up until the 19th century, while the main building forms a compact block taking a step backwards from the street to leave space for a forecourt.

The museum consists of four two- and three-story block-like buildings surrounding an inner courtyard, giving it the appearance of a fortress. The façade is austere and decorated with sculptures made by Bror Marklund (added in 1959) and reliefs by artist Robert Nilsson. In the courtyard by a pool is a sculpture called &quot;Näcken&quot; (&quot;The Neck&quot;) by Carl Frisendahl.

==== The bronze doors ====

Most of the decorations of the museum were selected through a series of competitions. In 1938, Marklund won the competition for creating the main entrance to the museum. The doors, called &quot;The Gates of History&quot; (&quot;Historiens Portar&quot;), took him thirteen years to make. They were finished and inaugurated in 1952. The doors were financed by philanthropist Eva Bonnier&#x27;s foundation.

The doors are high and weighs about each. Made of bronze, they were first cast at the Herman Bergman foundry and then chased by Marklund.

Through a series of ten fields, the doors depict the history of Sweden from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. The left door represents the Pagan era with Odin as a central figure, while the right door depicts Ansgar and the Christian era. A noted deviation from the historical theme, is the depiction of a standard, 1950s pilsner bottle on the far right side of the right-hand door. A common item with the workers who cast the doors and built the museum. The bottle was chased by Marklund and it is the only part of the bronze surface that has been polished to a shine by people touching it.
== Interior ==

The interior of the museum is spacious with room for both permanent and special exhibitions. The permanent displays are arranged in chronological order in rooms facing the inner courtyard, with the pre-Christian collections on the ground floor and the collections from around 800 onwards upstairs. The halls are constantly updated with adaption to new technology and to accommodate new exhibitions. The entrance hall was refurbished in 1994 to give a modern impression of a medieval knight&#x27;s hall. The floor was laid with stone and the exposed beams in the ceiling were made of concrete.

=== The Gold Room ===
Blasted into the bedrock beneath the central courtyard is the concrete vault known as the Gold Room, where a large number of gold and silver objects are on display. It was built in 1994 and paid for by a donation from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. Designed by architect Leif Blomberg, it resembles a mystic cult place with a representation of Mímir&#x27;s Well in the middle of the exhibition room. The floor and pillars in the room are made of limestone and diabase, and the décor is made from wrought iron. It is accessed through an underground passage from the entrance hall.

The room contains about 3000 objects made from a total of gold and more than silver. It was only with the heightened security the vault provided, that most of the gold objects could be on display for the general public.

== Collections ==

When Curman originally designed how the collections were to be displayed, he borrowed ideas from contemporary exhibitions, industrial fairs and storefronts. The idea was to entice and educate visitors, something that was met with skepticism from scholars who regarded the museum mainly as a scientific institution. It is one of the largest museums in Sweden with more than 10 million artefacts, registered under around 34,000 inventory numbers, and one of the largest collections of antiquities in Europe. About 6,200 of the objects are on display. In 2011, information about 480,000 of the objects in the museum were accessible through an online database. 65,000 of these entries were illustrated with drawings or photos. The database also contained information about 55,900 places in Sweden where archaeological finds had been made and approximately 267,300 bone finds (total weight about ). The database is constantly expanded and updated.

The Vikings collection comprise objects from around 800–1050, including weapons, the Söderala vane, the Mästermyr chest, archaeological finds from the Viking Age trading centre, Birka, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on Björkö, religious items from the era, foreign objects brought home from travels and raids in other parts of the world as well as thousands of finds related to the everyday life during that period.

The most noted objects in the Gold Room collection are the collars dating from around 350–500, made of gold from Roman coins. The room also contains Viking silver jewelry, bejeweled reliquaries from the Middle Ages, coins, ceremonial swords and spoils of war. The large number of preserved objects made from precious metals, is due to a law that was issued in the 17th century, stating that all such finds that were 100 years or older and with no owner, were to be redeemed by the government and sent to the History museum. The law is still in effect.

The museum&#x27;s collection of Swedish ecclesiastical art is extensive, and its origins span from the 12th century to the post-Reformation period. It contains objects such as wooden sculptures, altarpieces and crucifixes. Among these are the Reliquary of St. Elizabeth and the Viklau Madonna, one of the most well-preserved wooden sculptures from 12th-century Europe.

Textile works from the Middle Ages are kept in the Textile Chamber. The objects are mostly textiles used in churches or by priests and bishops. The oldest and most noted object is a 13th-century tapestry from Skog Church, the Skog tapestry. It was found in 1912, wrapped around a bridal crown. Another tapestry is the Grödinge tapestry.

== Exhibitions ==
The first comprehensive exhibition in the museum opened on 17April 1943. It was called &quot;Ten thousand years in Sweden&quot; and comprised exhibitions from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. The museum has since altered and remade the permanent exhibitions a number of times as well as hosted several new special exhibitions on an annual basis. These are often related to some topic that is currently under debate or otherwise current. Some of the special exhibitions were:
*&quot;Luxury products and unique portraits&quot;, 1997, exports from the Roman Empire to Scandinavia.
*&quot;Snow White and The Madness of Truth&quot;, 2004, an art installation that lead to an international controversy.
*&quot;Save History!&quot;, 2009, on how global warming and pollution destroys the cultural heritage.
*&quot;Boundless – a global voyage of discovery&quot;, 2011, about how different cultures have met and influenced each other throughout history.
*&quot;Three centuries of friendship between Russia and the Netherlands&quot;, 2013, with objects on loan from museums, archives and libraries in Russia and the Netherlands.
*&quot;Hidden stories&quot;, 2015, an exhibition interwoven in the permanent exhibitions with notes and stories highlighting sexuality and gender identity by providing an alternate view on history.

In 2010, a new permanent exhibition called &quot;Sweden&#x27;s History&quot; opened. It highlights personal items connected with milestones and turning points in Swedish history during the last 1000 years. In 2011, the museum created its first turnkey exhibition &quot;We call them Vikings&quot; in cooperation with Austrian MuseumsPartner and Studio Exhibit. The two-parts exhibition showcase other aspects of Viking life than that of stereotype barbarian raiders. , it has toured a number of venues in Europe and North America.

<doc id="1249514" wikidata="Q7274191" url="?curid=1249514" title="R v Church of Scientology of Toronto">
<text>The Queen v. Church of Scientology of Toronto was a 1992 Canadian criminal case involving the Church of Scientology and members of the organization, resulting in a conviction on two counts of breach of the public trust. It also involved previously untested sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

==Preceding==
An investigation into the Church of Scientology&#x27;s activities in Ontario was begun when stolen documents from public and private agencies as well as information on other covert activities in Canada turned up as part of the evidence collected in the Operation Snow White case in the U.S.

On March 3–4, 1983, police raided the Scientology headquarters in Toronto and seized an estimated 250,000 documents in more than 900 boxes.

==Trial==
The trial began on April 23, 1991.

It was during this case that the events that sparked the case of &quot;Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot; occurred.

==Results==
On June 25, 1992, seven members were convicted for operations against the Ontario Provincial Police, the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The Church of Scientology itself was convicted on two counts of breach of the public trust: infiltration of the offices of the Ontario Provincial Police and the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General. The Church of Scientology was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine, and three individuals were fined — Jacqueline Matz was fined $5,000, Ms. Wheeler and Donald Whitmore were each fined $2,000.

==Appeal==
The case was appealed in 1996 before the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the Church of Scientology and one of the individual defendants, Jacqueline Matz. The appellants advanced numerous grounds of appeal, some of which were abandoned at the hearing, and the remainder of which were rejected by the Court.

<text>Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship () is the second novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1795–96.

==Plot==

The novel is in eight books. The main character Wilhelm Meister undergoes a journey of self-realization. The story centers upon Wilhelm&#x27;s attempt to escape what he views as the empty life of a bourgeois businessman. After a failed romance with the theater, Wilhelm commits himself to the mysterious Tower Society.

=== Book One ===
(1) The housekeeper Barbara is waiting for her mistress, the actress Mariane, to return from her performance at the theater. When she arrives, Mariane ignores the presents from her suitor, Norberg, who is due to arrive in 14 days. Wilhelm, whom she loves despite his poor prospects, arrives, and they embrace. (2) The next morning Wilhelm argues with his mother about his obsession with the theater. They reminisce about the puppet show that his mother put on twelve years prior at Christmas. On account of the play (David &amp; Goliath) Wilhelm became entranced by the theater. He asks his mother where his old puppets are, wanting to show them to a friend.

(3) One night Wilhelm brings his box of puppets to show Mariane and Barbara. They spend the evening listening to Wilhelm tell stories about the aforementioned puppet show.&quot;It is pleasant and satisfying to remember the obstacles that we sadly thought were insurmountable, and then compare what we, as mature persons, have now developed into, with what we were then, in our immaturity. I cannot tell you how happy I am now that I can talk to you about the past - now that I gaze out towards the joyous landscape that we shall travel hand in hand.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(4) The young soldier who had constructed the theater and put on the play persuades Wilhelm&#x27;s father to a repeat performance. After this show Wilhelm gets curious and peeks under the curtain.&quot;...these mysteries disturbed me so much that I wanted to be both among the enchanted and the enchanters, somehow secretly to have a hand in it, and at the same time, as a spectator, be able to enjoy the pleasure of the illusion.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(5) One Sunday morning Wilhelm sneaks into the pantry and finds the box of puppets. He steals the playbook of David and Goliath. He reads it over and over, memorizing all the parts, performing it for his parents until he has an opportunity to help the lieutenant with another performance in the house. (6) During the performance Wilhelm drops his Jonathan puppet, but otherwise performs his parts well. In the coming spring Wilhelm practices with siblings, friends, and by himself. He finds Gottsched&#x27;s “The German Stage,” which he begins to practice—preferring always the fifth acts. Mariane is getting sleepy, but Wilhelm is blissfully unaware. He asks of her childhood, but Barbara suggests that he continue his own story (of the theater). (7) Wilhelm begins acting with friends and wishes to do a rendition of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;. The friends struggle to furnish their play with the necessary materials, and on the night of the performance they realize that no one has any lines planned. After one aborted attempt, they decide to play David and Goliath (from the earlier puppet shows).

(8) By this point Mariane has fallen asleep, but Wilhelm continues his story, this time about how he and his friends attempted to turn all manner of novels, stories, and histories into plays. By the time he was fourteen he was being groomed for a job in commerce, which his adolescent heart couldn&#x27;t bear. He composed a poem where the Muse of Tragedy vied with a figure of Commerce. Wilhelm is so inspired in his speech that he wakes Mariane up.

(9) Wilhelm allows his imagination to run wild in the following days&quot;Fate, he decided, was extending its helping hand to him, through Mariane, to draw him out of that stifling, draggle-tailed middle-class existence he had so long desired to escape.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(10) Preparing to set out for a business trip, Wilhelm pores over the books and papers in his room. His friend, Werner, enters, and gives Wilhelm a speech about the power and attraction of double bookkeeping (&quot;doppelte Buchführung&quot;) and world commerce.

(11) It was Wilhelm and Werner&#x27;s fathers, described here, who had organized this commercial journey for him. Wilhelm is thrilled at the chance to use this trip as his escape. He visits Mariane in at night and alerts her to the plan. (12) In the morning Mariane is miserable and talks to Barbara about her options. She loves Wilhelm but is awaiting the near arrival of her rich suitor, Norberg.

(13) In the meantime, Wilhelm has arrived at the house of his father&#x27;s business associate—only to hear that the man&#x27;s daughter has run away with an actor. An uncomfortable Wilhelm stays the night and, after setting out the next morning, sees a wagon bringing the pair of lovers back to town. Wilhelm goes to the courthouse and hears their confessions of love, which inspires him to act as their mediator. (14) Wilhelm talks with Melina (the young male lover) alone and is dismayed to hear that he wants to leave the theater. Nevertheless, he offers to try and convince the girl&#x27;s parents to find him a job in the village. Wilhelm fails to secure him a position, and the pair of lovers must leave in a few days.

(15) On his way home Wilhelm recollects his initial romance with Mariane. When he arrives, Werner tries to talk him out of the relationship. Ill at ease, Wilhelm rushes off to see Mariane that evening, and his spirits are revived as they reminisce about past times together. (16) Wilhelm writes to Mariane, detailing his plans to start their new life together.

(17) Wilhelm finds Mariane in a strange mood and decides to hold on to the letter; she tells him not to return that night. He wanders the streets and meets a stranger who reveals his knowledge of Wilhelm&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s art collection, which was sold in Wilhelm&#x27;s childhood. Wilhelm returns to Mariane&#x27;s, and as he waits outside he sees a dark figure emerge from her door. At home he takes out Mariane&#x27;s scarf; a concealed note, written by Mariane&#x27;s other suitor, falls out.

=== Book Two ===
(1-2) Over the next couple years Wilhelm occupies himself with business affairs and agonizes over what happened with Mariane. Werner stokes his anger toward Mariane, but on one occasion attempts to stop Wilhelm from burning all of his old keepsakes and theater manuscripts.

(3) While on another business trip, Wilhelm hears there will be a play put on by factory workers in the small village of Hochdorf; he decides to attend. After more strenuous travels he finally rests in a town where he has no business to conduct. (4) In the town are a traveling group of acrobats and the remnants of a theater troupe. The former includes the androgynous child Mignon, whom Wilhelm buys from the cruel manager of the troupe at the end of the chapter; the latter includes Philine and Laertes, whom Wilhelm befriends and dines with over the next few days. He takes time to watch the performances of the acrobats.

(5-6). After having disappeared Mignon returns and acts as Wilhelm&#x27;s servant. He stays in town, practicing his fencing and dancing, until Melina and Madam Melina appear, looking for work. Although they do not get along well with Philine and Laertes, Melina plans to start a new theater company, with Wilhelm footing the bill for scenery and costumes. Wilhelm begins to regret staying so long in the town. (7) Four newcomers arrive in town; one of whom is an “oldish man,” whom Wilhelm recognized from performances with Mariane. Wilhelm finds out from him that three years ago Mariane became pregnant and had been dismissed from her theater company. (8) Still reeling from the news, Wilhelm returns to his room, where Mignon performs her egg dance for him. He is so moved by it that he realizes his wish to take her as his own child.

(9) The next day the whole troupe takes a boat down the river to a new lunch spot. While extemporizing a play, they are joined by a “clergyman,” who later talks to Wilhelm privately about fate, education, and acting.&quot;&#x27;But,&#x27; said Wilhelm, &#x27;shouldn&#x27;t natural talent be all that an actor...needs to enable him to reach the high goal he has set himself?&#x27; &#x27;That should certainly be, and continue to be, the alpha and omega, beginning and end; but in between he will be deficient if he does not somehow cultivate what he has, and what he is to be, and that quite early on. It could be that those considered geniuses are worse off than those with ordinary abilities, for a genius can more easily than ordinary men be distorted and go astray.&#x27;&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(10) The clergyman disappears, and when the friends return to the inn they get inebriated on punch while performing an impromptu play set in the German Middle Ages. (11) Dispirited by the damage caused by them, Wilhelm covers the costs the next morning. At dinner a harper appears, who sings ballads and lifts everyone&#x27;s spirits. His appearance turns their conversation once again to the purchase of theater props and costumes. (12) Upset by the conversation, Wilhelm goes to sit alone. Philine joins him and embarrasses him with public caresses before leaving. Wilhelm goes after her and runs into Melina, with whom he makes amends. Wilhelm offers to buy the theater equipment. Philine&#x27;s former serving boy, Friedrich, who has just returned, beats Wilhelm to Philine&#x27;s room. Wilhelm, returning home and ignoring Mignon, overhears a horseman say that shortly a count and a prince will be arriving at the neighboring estate. (13) By this point Wilhelm is so distraught that he seeks out the harper, who comforts him with serenades late into the night.

(14) Wilhelm feels he needs a definite goal. He approves Melina&#x27;s purchase of the theater equipment with a notary. That evening Friedrich has an outburst about Philine&#x27;s rendezvous with the stablemaster, which is settled amicably. Wilhelm returns to his room; in the midst of his indecision Mignon enters. When Wilhelm talks about leaving she starts having convulsions and heart pains. The two commit themselves to each other—as father and child.

=== Book Three ===
(1) The following morning Mignon enters Wilhelm&#x27;s room, singing a song for the zither (“Kennst du das Land?”), which reveals clues about her background. Meanwhile, the count and countess arrive. They meet the entire troupe and agree to hire them on at their castle. (2) Several days later the count sends a baron to settle their contracts. Himself a connoisseur of the German theater, the baron reads his own five-act composition, and the troupe agrees to perform it. (3) Carriages arrive to take the troupe to the castle. They are unable to stop at an inn on the way for want of space. With the bustle around the castle and the heavy rain, they are sent round to the old, unfurnished portion, where no one is waiting to welcome them—the baron had injured himself during the ride. Completely drenched and hungry, they do not receive food and proper furnishings until long past midnight. (4) The count arrives early the next morning, apologizing profusely for their treatment. Wilhelm lays curious eyes on Jarno, a mysterious officer who is known to be the prince&#x27;s favorite. Melina struggles to keep the troupe behaved in their new accommodations, but rehearsals begin shortly.

(5) Wilhelm has the chance to perform for the countess one morning. The baroness and Philine are also present, and the busyness of the day keeps him from his recitation. Although disappointed, Wilhelm receives a couple tokens from the countess. (6) Melina tells Wilhelm that they are to prepare a prologue to perform for the prince at his arrival, which Wilhelm writes the next day. However, his piece clashes with the count&#x27;s vision, and that evening he meets secretly with the countess and baroness to enlist their help. (7) Wilhelm meets the count for breakfast, and they brainstorm the use of an allegorical Minerva for the prologue. During the rehearsal all the nobles and Jarno work to keep the count satisfied and distracted. (8) The prince arrives, and the prologue goes over well. As the troupe continues to perform daily, those whom Wilhelm respects begin to absent themselves more and more. One day Wilhelm tries to engage the prince in conversation about French drama, but he is roundly ignored. Jarno, who has been slowly encouraging Wilhelm to dissociate himself from the rest of the troupe, recommends he read Shakespeare.&quot;And in a very short while, he was seized, as one would expect, by the torrent of a great genius which swept toward a limitless ocean in which he completely lost and forgot his own self.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(9) The troupe starts to unravel as a disparaging poem about the baron circulates. The pedant, who is thought by some to be the anonymous author, is ambushed and beaten one night. During this time Wilhelm keeps himself above the fray and occupies himself Shakespeare, intervening only when Friedrich arrives at the castle and is thought to be an intruder.

(10) When one day the count rides off to hunt, the baroness and Philine come up with a scheme to bring Wilhelm and the countess together. In the evening Wilhelm disguises himself as the count, and the ladies prepare her for a surprise encounter. The count returns unexpectedly early, however, and sees a disguised Wilhelm sitting in his chair. What the count understands to have happened is left ambiguous, but he becomes quiet and brooding. Later on he asks Wilhelm to read to him. (11) Wilhelm seeks out Jarno to talk about his infatuation with Shakespeare. Jarno tries to persuade Wilhelm to give up acting for the “active life.” The conversation turns sour, however, when Jarno disparages the harper and Mignon. Wilhelm recommits himself to the latter and regrets ever having listened to Jarno. (12) The count continues acting in his strange new manner, as the baroness and Jarno work to reinforce it. The army, prince, and count all intend to move on. Before their departure Wilhelm receives a ring from the countess and notices his initials on her bracelet—which she denies are his. They share a kiss and embrace before the countess screams and they separate.

=== Book Four ===
(1) Mignon reminds Wilhelm of his obligation to his family. He writes to them after having grudgingly accepted a purse of money from the count via the baron. The troupe prepares to travel on, and Wilhelm has to convince the harper, who believes he is being pursued by an inexorable fate, to stay with them. (2) In their travels Wilhelm takes inspiration from Shakespeare&#x27;s Prince Hal and adjusts his own manner and costume. When the troupe begins to mock their previous patrons Wilhelm rebukes them and gives a speech on the upper and lower classes. Inspired by the speech, Philine suggests they perform an entire play right on the spot. Everyone is satisfied, and after Wilhelm comments on the relation of orchestral music and the theater, the troupe takes on a new republican form of governance—electing Wilhelm as their first director. (3) Wilhelm takes the opportunity to deliver an exegesis on the character, Hamlet. He advocates a studious approach of the entire text in order to reconcile contradictions and penetrate into the author&#x27;s mind.

(4) Before they set out, Philine explains to Wilhelm why Laertes is so bitter towards women. The townsfolk warn their troupe of armed partisans spotted along the route they will take. The rest wish to reroute, but Wilhelm persuades them otherwise, and they set out. Finding a wooded hilltop, they break from their journey. (5) The troupe eats and drinks; Wilhelm and Laertes rehearse a sword fight. Suddenly an armed band attacks. After putting up some resistance, Wilhelm falls unconscious after being shot. He wakes up in Philine&#x27;s lap with Mignon keeping watch. Everyone else is safe and in town; the harper has gone to fetch a surgeon. (6) Night is approaching when the three hear horses. An “Amazon” with a whole company of attendants is riding up. There is a surgeon with them, who extracts the bullets while the Amazon gives Wilhelm her coat. The impression of her beauty has an extreme effect on Wilhelm as he slips back into unconsciousness.

(7) By the time Wilhelm comes to, the harper has arrived with help. The others are sheltered in an inn, and they try to bar access to Wilhelm and Philine. Having lost their possessions—all except Philine—they vent their anger at Wilhelm. (8) Wilhelm rebukes them all and, as news arrives that Madame Melina&#x27;s baby was stillborn, he promises to not abandon them until he has found a way to repay them. (9) One of the Amazon&#x27;s men arranged for Wilhelm and Philine, the “married couple,” to stay with a village pastor. Philine ingratiates herself to the hosts while looking after Wilhelm. During his convalescence, Wilhelm replays the encounter with the Amazon in his head over and over. (10) Eventually all the actors come to visit. Laertes asks for a letter of recommendation to join Serlo&#x27;s troupe. Wilhelm and Philine have several spats about the money he is spending on others, and she leaves in the night. (11-12) Before going to see Serlo himself, Wilhelm sends the harper to inquire about the Amazon. No information is discovered, but Wilhelm notes a similarity between his Amazon and the countess. He constantly rebukes himself for how he let the troupe down and sets off to join them.

(13) Wilhelm arrives and hears from Serlo that the actors have proven disappointing. Wilhelm gives an exegesis of Hamlet&#x27;s character to Serlo and his sister, Aurelie:&quot;In these words [&#x27;the time is out of joint; O cursed spite! That ever I was born to set it right!&#x27;], so I believe, lies the key to Hamlet&#x27;s whole behavior; and it is clear to me what Shakespeare set out to portray: a heavy deed placed on a soul which is not adequate to cope with it.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(14) Aurelie takes Wilhelm to the adjoining room and asks for his thoughts on Ophelia. Midway through, she bursts into tears. Serlo enters with Philine, and when the brother and sister absent themselves, Philine shares hints about Aurelie&#x27;s unrequited love and her 3-year-old son. (15) Wilhelm spends the next few evenings watching Serlo&#x27;s impressive troupe perform, and Philine tries to flatter him into acting. Aurelie takes Wilhelm aside one day and begins to reveal her past. Serlo comes in and Wilhelm attempts to justify the overall plan of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. (16) Wilhelm and Aurelie resume their discussion of Ophelia&#x27;s part when Serlo snatches a dagger from Aurelie&#x27;s table—which she wrestles away from him. Aurelie compliments Wilhelm on his poetic insight, yet criticizes his lack of judgment about people. She picks up her life story, which involves a deceased husband, who was Serlo&#x27;s partner in the theater, and a more recent lover, Lothario, who reinvigorated her hope for the German public and nation.

(17) Wilhelm finally decides to pick up the letters from his father and Werner. Wilhelm is relieved at their mild tone and writes back, promising a detailed travelogue, for which he enlists the help of Laertes. (18) We learn of Serlo&#x27;s background: a harsh childhood and early talent for mimicry as well as theatrical roles at a monastery, in a community called the “Children of Joy,” and solo. (19) Serlo offers to take the actors on permanently if Wilhelm himself agrees to act. He is unable to make a decision between joining Serlo&#x27;s outfit or resuming his business activities.&quot;An inner voice impels you to follow one of the other, and there are valid external reasons for choosing either. But you can’t decide….And yet, if you are honest, you must admit that the urge towards a life of business proceeds entirely from external factors, whereas your inner desires are direct toward the development and perfection of your predisposition, both bodily and mental, toward what is good and beautiful.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(20) Still undecided, he pays a visit to Aurelie, who is totally beside herself on account of the love she feels toward her “Lothario.” Wilhelm makes a vow to never again confess love to any woman to whom he will not devote his entire life. Aurelie pulls out a dagger and slashes his hand.

=== Book Five ===
(1) Aurelie&#x27;s restlessness affects others, like Felix, who has picked up a number of bad habits (e.g. drinking out of the bottle rather than a glass); Mignon begins to care for him more and more. Wilhelm, pleased with Serlo&#x27;s decision to put together a musical group composed of the harper, Mignon, and Laertes, is shattered when he receives news of his father&#x27;s death. He is unable to decide his next step, and feels pressure on all sides, when he receives a letter from Werner, the contents of which are: (2) Werner is marrying his sister, and they, along with Wilhelm&#x27;s mother, will move into Werner&#x27;s family&#x27;s house. From the estate sale of the old Meister&#x27;s house they will invest in agricultural improvements, which Wilhelm will supervise in six months hence. Wilhelm is very displeased with the plan, and writes back. (3) He confesses that the impressive travelogue was fictitious, digresses on the difference between nobility and the bourgeoisie, and shares his decision to pursue life in the theater. Assuming a different name, he signs a contract with Serlo.

(4) In order to perform &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Serlo demands that Wilhelm modify the play. Although reluctant, Wilhelm takes some time and decides to simplify the “external circumstances” of the plot. (5) Wilhelm shares his changes with the group; they are satisfied and divide roles. (6) Some roles still need to be filled. The prompter is to take the Pyrrhus passage. Wilhelm decides to leave the Ghost&#x27;s role open after receiving a mysterious note one evening:&quot;We know full well, o wondrous youth, that you are in a serious predicament. You can hardly find enough living persons for your &quot;Hamlet&quot;, let alone ghosts...We cannot perform miracles, but...if you have confidence in us, the Ghost will appear at the appointed hour. Take courage, and be not afraid. A reply is not necessary, we will be informed of your decision.&quot; (Trans. Blackall &amp; Lange, 1989)(7) One evening the company discusses the differences between novels and dramas. (8) At the first full rehearsal two devotees of the theater arrive. They observe and give Wilhelm and the others plenty of useful advice.(9) Serlo and Wilhelm iron out a few issues—e.g. the two portraits and Hamlet&#x27;s death. (10) On the evening before the performance there is still no Ghost, but Wilhelm has faith in his appearance. Aurelie takes Wilhelm aside and disparages Philine. Not giving in, Wilhelm retires to his room, where he finds Philine&#x27;s slippers but no Philine. He has trouble falling asleep. (11) The next day passes swiftly, and during the overture someone announces that the Ghost has arrived—which Wilhelm had completely forgotten about. Wilhelm performs splendidly on account of his genuine nervousness at the Ghost&#x27;s appearance. (12) The performance is a success. The company convenes for dinner, at which all receive their share of praise. After disbanding, the stage manager brings Wilhelm the Ghost&#x27;s veil, which had caught in the trapdoor. At that moment Mignon bites Wilhelm and then disappears. Later in his room a mysterious figure emerges from behind the stove and smothers him with kisses.

(13) Wilhelm awakens in a blur, unaware of the identity of his midnight visitor. In the veil he notices an embroidered message: “For the first and last time, young man, flee!” Mignon enters with breakfast, seeming somehow different. In daily preparations the company has lost interest in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. That evening there is a fire. During the commotion, Mignon saves Felix from the bizarre, threatening actions of the harper. No one is hurt, and Wilhelm spends the night outside. They perform the play again the next day.

(14) Wilhelm and the children set up house in the pavilion, and one night Wilhelm forcibly keeps the harper from escaping. (15) The harper is put into the care of a country pastor. Wilhelm grows more frustrated with the audience&#x27;s uncultured responses to &quot;Hamlet&quot;. One evening he spies an unknown guest, dressed as an officer, in Philine&#x27;s room. He believes it to be Mariane, but Laertes guesses it is Friedrich. The two abscond during the night, and Wilhelm has them followed. (16) The company faces growing challenges and friction. New actors arrive, Serlo and the others cannot agree about their repertoire. Wilhelm visits the country pastor and harper, and he finds the latter much improved. Serlo and Melina become close partners and begin pushing Wilhelm out. During preparations for Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot;, Aurelie&#x27;s condition worsens. Wilhelm cares for her and reads a manuscript, “Confessions of a Beautiful Soul,” which the same doctor from earlier in the story brings him. After she dies, Wilhelm leaves the troupe, delivering a letter to her faithless lover.

==Shakespeare motif==
&quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; depicts the eighteenth-century German reception of William Shakespeare&#x27;s dramas: the protagonist is introduced to these by the character Jarno, and extensive discussion of Shakespeare&#x27;s work occurs within the novel&#x27;s dialogues. Wilhelm and his theater group give a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which Wilhelm plays the lead role. Shakespeare&#x27;s work had begun to be translated into German in the 1740s, and had attained tremendous popularity and influence in Germany by the end of the century. A young Goethe had presided over and given a speech in celebration of Shakespeare&#x27;s genius on October 14, 1771, in Frankfurt. A second simultaneous celebration was held in Strasbourg. Goethe has Shakespeare play a prominent role in Wilhelm&#x27;s growth with the theater group as he &quot;rejoiced the more that his name was Wilhelm&quot; and acknowledges Shakespeare as a namesake, friend, and godfather.

==Origins==
Goethe&#x27;s work on the novel began in the 1770s. An early version of the work, unpublished during Goethe&#x27;s lifetime, was discovered in the early twentieth century, and published under the title &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Theatrical Calling&quot; (&quot;Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung&quot;). When the &quot;Apprenticeship&quot; was completed in the mid-1790s, it was to a great extent through the encouragement and criticism of Goethe&#x27;s close friend and collaborator Friedrich Schiller that it took its final shape. &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre&quot; (&quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Journeyman Years&quot; or &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Travels&quot;), the sequel to the &quot;Apprenticeship&quot;, was already planned in the 1790s, but did not appear in its first edition until 1821, and in its final form until 1829.

==Genre==
Further books patterned after this novel have been called &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; (&quot;novels of formation&quot;), despite the fact that Wilhelm&#x27;s &quot;Bildung&quot; (&quot;education&quot;, or &quot;formation of character&quot;) is ironized by the narrator at many points.

According to Andrew Crumey, &quot;while &quot;Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship&quot; is billed as the classic coming-of-age tale, or Bildungsroman, it’s really far more than that: a story of education and disillusionment, a novel of ideas ranging across literature, philosophy and politics, a masterpiece that resists all pigeonholing.&quot;

The novel could also be described as an example of what Graham Wolfe has called &quot;theatre-fiction&quot;.

==Legacy==

The novel has had a significant impact on European literature and philosophy. Romantic critic and theorist Friedrich Schlegel judged it to be of comparable importance for its age to the French Revolution and the philosophy of Johann Gottlieb Fichte; and Schopenhauer cited &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; as one of the four immortal romances. He says of the book in his &quot;Aphorismen zur Lebensweisheit&quot;: &quot;where we were looking for pleasure, happiness and joy, we often find instruction, insight and knowledge, a lasting and real benefit in place of a fleeting one. This idea runs like a bass-note through Goethe&#x27;s Wilhelm Meister; for this is an intellectual novel and is of a higher order than the rest.&quot;

&quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, being a seminal work of Romantic literature, has provided the text for many Romantic &quot;Lieder&quot;. Beethoven composed his &quot;Sehnsucht: Gedicht von Goethe viermal in Musik gesetzt von L. van Beethoven&quot;, WoO. 134, four settings of &quot;Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt&quot;, in 1808. Likewise Franz Schubert set eight poems from the novel, several more than once. His &quot;Gesänge aus Wilhelm Meister&quot;, Op. 62, are a well-known effort dating from 1826. Robert Schumann felt special affection for the novel and set &quot;Kennst du das Land&quot; from book in his Lieder-Album für die Jugend, Op. 79. In 1849 he composed a cycle, the &quot;Lieder und Gesänge aus Wilhelm Meister&quot;, Op. 98a, taking that same song as its first and additionally setting all but one of the rest of the novel&#x27;s poems. The same year he completed the &quot;Requiem for Mignon&quot;, Op. 98b, not a true requiem but a tragic choral work with orchestra setting the passage in book 8 which describes Mignon&#x27;s funeral. The two share an Opus number.

The work exerted an influence over musicians into the later part of the nineteenth century, especially because of its pedigree of settings by earlier Romantics. Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s opera &quot;Mignon&quot;, composed in 1866, was based upon the novel, and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Op. 6 &quot;Romances&quot;, from three years later, contain the song &quot;None but the Lonely Heart&quot;, setting a translation into Russian of &quot;Wilhelm Meister&quot;&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt&quot;. Other later composers to set poems from the novel as &quot;Lieder&quot; include Wolf, Medtner, Reisenauer and Damrosch. Minjona, a contemporary women&#x27;s choir based at the University of Latvia, is dedicated to &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;.

The novel has given rise to many pieces of visual art. Mignon, a tragic character who has particularly captivated artists, is the subject of famous paintings by Schadow and Bouguereau; Scheffer&#x27;s Mignon desires her fatherland is also well-known. Two films with the name &quot;Mignon&quot;&quot;, hailing from 1915 and 1922, were based upon the novel, as well as several television films. But the best-known screen version is Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Move&quot;, a free adaptation with screenplay by Peter Handke and starring Rüdiger Vogler.

<text>Wilhelm Meister is the main character in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s novels &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; and its sequel &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Journeyman Years&quot;.

==Description and history==
Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s story concerns how he comes from a family of businessmen and desires to transcend bourgeois life. In &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, published in 1795–1796, he tries to achieve this by joining a theatre troupe and a secret society. In &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Journeyman Years&quot;, published in 1821 and revised substantially in 1829, he travels widely without a permanent residence.

Goethe chose the name Wilhelm as a nod to William Shakespeare, whose works feature prominently in &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;. The last name Meister, meaning &quot;Master&quot;, reflects the character&#x27;s capability and active role. A recurring motif throughout both novels is Meister&#x27;s fascination with the painting &quot;The King&#x27;s Sick Son&quot; by Antonio Bellucci.

==In other media==
Meister is portrayed in various adaptations of Goethe&#x27;s novels, notably as a tenor in the 1866 opera &quot;Mignon&quot; composed by Ambroise Thomas. Rüdiger Vogler played a variation of Meister in Wim Wenders&#x27; 1975 film &quot;The Wrong Move&quot;, which is loosely based on &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; but takes place in post-war West Germany.

<text>The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) (RHLI) is a Primary Reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Army, based at John Weir Foote VC Armoury in Hamilton, Ontario. The RHLI is part of 31 Canadian Brigade Group, which is part of 4th Canadian Division.

==Badge==

===Description===
&quot;On an autumnal maple leaf proper a bugle Argent stringed Vert enclosing the letters RHLI Or and ensigned by the Royal Crown proper, the base of the leaf surmounted by two scrolls Azure edged and inscribed WENTWORTH REGIMENT and SEMPER PARATUS in letters Or.&quot;

===Symbolism===
The maple leaf represents service to Canada, and the Crown, service to the Sovereign. The regiment&#x27;s light infantry heritage is symbolised by the bugle. Combined, &quot;RHLI&quot; and &quot;WENTWORTH REGIMENT&quot; are a form of the regimental title, and &quot;SEMPER PARATUS&quot; is the motto of the regiment.

==Lineage==

=== The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry ===

* The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry originated in Hamilton, Ontario on 11 December 1862 as the 13th Battalion Volunteer Militia (Infantry), Canada. It was redesignated as the 13th Regiment on 8 May 1900; as the 13th &quot;Royal Regiment&quot; on 3 January 1910; and as the Royal Hamilton Regiment on 1 May 1920. It was organised as a four battalion regiment with the 1st Battalion (perpetuating the 13th Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF) on the Non Permanent Active Militia order of battle, and the 2nd Battalion (perpetuating the 86th Battalion (Machine Gun), CEF), 3rd Battalion (perpetuating the 120th Battalion (City of Hamilton) CEF), and 4th Battalion (perpetuating the 205th Battalion (Hamilton), CEF)) on the Reserve order of battle. On 15 June 1926, the 1st Battalion was redesignated the 1st Battalion (perpetuating the 4th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF). The reserve units were disbanded on 14 December 1936.

* The regiment was redesignated as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry on 15 March 1927. On 15 December 1936, it amalgamated with the headquarters and three companies of the Wentworth Regiment and was redesignated as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment). It was redesignated as the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) on 7 November 1940 and as the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) on 31 December 1945.

* On 4 May 1951, the regiment mobilised two temporary Active Force companies designated &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; Company. &quot;E&quot; Company was reduced to nil strength upon its personnel being incorporated into the 1st Canadian Rifle Battalion (later the 1st Battalion, the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) for service in Germany with NATO. It was disbanded on 29 July 1953. &quot;F&quot; Company was initially used as a reinforcement pool for &quot;E&quot; Company. On 15 May 1952, it was reduced to nil strength, upon its personnel being absorbed by the newly formed 2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion (later the 2nd Battalion, the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) for service with the United Nations in Korea.
=== The Wentworth Regiment ===
* The Wentworth Regiment originated in Dundas, Ontario on 23 May 1872 as the 77th &quot;Wentworth&quot; Battalion of Infantry. It was redesignated as the 77th Wentworth Regiment on 8 May 1900; and as the Wentworth Regiment on 1 May 1920. On 15 December 1936, it was amalgamated with the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.

===South African War===
The 13th Regiment contributed volunteers for the Canadian Contingents, principally the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry.

===The Great War===
Details of the 77th Wentworth Regiment were called out on active service on 6 August 1914 for local protection duties.

The 4th Battalion (Central Ontario), CEF was authorised on 10 August 1914 and embarked for Britain on 3 October 1914. It disembarked in France on 12 February 1915, and fought as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division¸ in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 30 August 1920.

The 86th Battalion (Machine Gun), CEF was authorised on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 19 May 1916 where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 22 June 1916, when it was reorganised in Britain as the &#x27;Canadian Machine Gun Depot, CEF&#x27;. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on 1 September 1917.

The 120th Battalion (City of Hamilton) CEF was authorised on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Britain on 14 August 1916 where it provided reinforcements to the Canadian Corps in the field until 20 January 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the &#x27;2nd Reserve Battalion, CEF&#x27;.

The regiment mobilised the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, CASF for active service on 1 September 1939. It was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, CASF on 7 November 1940. It embarked for Britain on 22 July 1940. The battalion took part in Operation Jubilee on 19 August 1942. (General Denis Whitaker, who fought as a captain with the RHLI at Dieppe, in a 1989 interview stated, “The defeat cleared out all the dead weight. It was the best thing that ever happed to the regiment.”)

The RHLI returned to France on 5 July 1944 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion was subsequently disbanded on 31 December 1945.

On 4 May 1951, the regiment mobilised two temporary Active Force companies designated &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; Company for service on NATO duty in Germany and United Nations duty in Korea respectively. &quot;E&quot; Company was reduced to nil strength upon its personnel being incorporated into the &#x27;1st Canadian Rifle Battalion&#x27;. &quot;F&quot; Company was initially used as a reinforcement pool for &quot;E&quot; Company until 15 May 1952 when it was reduced to nil strength, upon its personnel being absorbed by the newly formed &#x27;2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion&#x27;.

===War in Afghanistan===
The regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorised strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014.

==History==
The regiment has a long history, which includes perpetuating the 2nd Regiment of York Militia from the War of 1812. Its formal lineage descends from the 13th Regiment, formed 11 December 1862, on a general order issued by the Governor General. It has earned thirty-nine battle honours in the two world wars. Most recently, members from the regiment deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
They suffered their greatest single day of losses at Dieppe, France, on 19 August 1942.

The anniversary of Dieppe is recognized each year by the regiment.

===History 1862–1913===
The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry has a rich history in Hamilton and Wentworth County. The regiment has two direct antecedents, and indirect antecedents include the 1st and 2nd Companies of Volunteer Rifles (Hamilton), formed in 1855, and the Volunteer Highland Company (No. 3 Company) formed in 1856.

The RHLI&#x27;s earliest direct ancestor is the 13th Battalion of Volunteer Militia established in 1862, which along with the 2nd Battalion the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles are modern Canada&#x27;s oldest fighting regiments, having first seen combat in June 1866 at the Battle of Ridgeway against an invading Irish American Fenian insurgent army composed of better armed and more experienced recent civil war veterans. The regimental cap badge still bears the supposedly unlucky number from its oldest official antecedent. When the 13th Battalion first saw action at the Battle of Ridgeway it took heavy casualties and was forced to fall back along with the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles. The 13th Battalion commanding officer Lt. Colonel Alfred Booker who was in command of the brigade deployed in the battle was blamed for the disaster.

In 1870, another contingent from the battalion served in Manitoba during the Red River Rebellion. The regiment also traces ancestry to the 77th (Wentworth) Battalion of Volunteer Militia. Founded under that name in 1872, it was renamed the 77th Wentworth Regiment in 1900.

Between 1899 and 1902, during the Boer War, many members of the 13th served in South Africa as members of the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment and the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles. Not asked to mobilise for the war, the 13th Battalion remained in Canada and was redesignated &quot;13th Regiment&quot; in 1900 and &quot;13th Royal Regiment&quot; in 1910.

===History 1914–1938===
When the Great War began in 1914, Colonel Sam Hughes, Canada&#x27;s Minister of Militia, scrapped the original national mobilisation plan and asked the commanding officers of Militia units for volunteers to serve with battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). Consequently, many members of the 13th Royal Regiment went overseas with the 4th Battalion, CEF, part of the famous First Contingent. Throughout the war, the unit served as a depot regiment that enrolled and trained men before despatching them to deploying CEF battalions. The CEF was not the only destination, either; the Royal Flying Corps accepted 82 men from the 13th, and 81 went to the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve. Locally raised CEF battalions that received soldiers from the 13th included the 19th Battalion, CEF (145 men), 36th Battalion, CEF (124 men), 76th Battalion, CEF (506 men), 86th (Machine Gun) Battalion, CEF (600 men), 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, CEF (625 men) and the 205th (Tiger) Battalion, CEF (704 men). Of these, the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion CEF had the closest affiliation with the 13th Royal Regiment, so on 28 May 1916, that battalion formally accepted the regiment&#x27;s colours and took them overseas. The colours were laid up in Westminster Abbey until 5 March 1919, when the Dean of Westminster returned them to veterans of the 120th (City of Hamilton) Battalion, which was broken up to reinforce other CEF battalions in 1917.

In the interwar period, the Canadian Militia underwent two major reorganisations (in 1920 and again in 1936) and several minor ones. The Hamilton area did not escape, and in 1920 the two most significant RHLI antecedents acquired new names: The &quot;Royal Hamilton Regiment&quot; and The &quot;Wentworth Regiment&quot;. In 1927, the former became the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, and the final reorganisation in 1936 brought all but one company of the Wentworth Regiment into the RHLI, which then received its current title: The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment). To this day, the regiment is informally known as the Rileys.

===History 1939–1945===
On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, all the units of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of Canada were mobilised for overseas service. (This was not done in 1899 or 1914 because the original terms of sovereignty under the British North America Act-amended by the Statute of Westminster in 1931-did not include authority to deploy troops outside Canadian territory.) The Rileys were mobilised with the Canadian Active Service Force on 1 September 1939, reinforced from the 2nd Battalion at the regiment&#x27;s home station, which began recruiting for home defence in early 1940. In November 1940, the active service battalion was redesignated the 1st Battalion, RHLI.

The 1st Battalion was assigned to the 4th Infantry Brigade in the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The battalion saw combat for the first time at Dieppe on August 19, 1942. Of the 582 soldiers who landed that morning, only 102 (18 percent) were not among the casualties: 197 killed, 174 captured and 194 wounded (including 85 also captured). The Dieppe survivors suffered great physical trauma and psychological distress as a result of the battle and the loss of so many of their friends and comrades in a battle that lasted only about eight hours.

The most highly decorated member of the battalion was the chaplain, Honorary Captain the Reverend John Foote, who remained at Dieppe with his wounded and captured comrades rather than accept evacuation to Britain. Padre Foote was nominated for the Victoria Cross while still a prisoner of war; the award was made after VE Day.

The 2nd Canadian Division came under command of the newly formed II Canadian Corps in Britain, and after almost two years of training after Dieppe, returned to France after D-Day to fight through the Battle of Normandy from early July onwards. During Operation Spring, the Rileys earned the distinction of being the only assault unit to hold their objective (the village of Verrières). During the winter of 1944-45, the Rileys fought through the Battle of the Scheldt and the Rhineland, and on V-E Day was deep into Germany.

===History 1945–1999===
In the post-war period, the regular battalion was demobilized and the reserve battalion consequently lost its number. It looked like the RHLI would revert to the genteel neglect of the interwar period, until the Cold War interrupted. Some Rileys served in the United Nations Special Force in the Korean War and in 1955 the regiment was represented in the 27th Brigade that served on NATO duty in West Germany.

At home, its armoury was renamed in honour of Padre Foote, VC. In 1978, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was appointed colonel-in-chief of the regiment, an appointment he held until his death in 2021. The RHLI, formerly part of the Hamilton Militia District, became part of Land Force Central Area&#x27;s 31 Canadian Brigade Group in the 1990s.

The town of Dieppe, France, set aside a small park at the western end of the esplanade in which it erected a memorial of its own. Standing in the centre of the Square du Canada (Canada Square), the Dieppe-Canada Monument is a testimony to the association between Canadians and Normans which has existed since Samuel de Champlain sailed to found New France. The names of people and events which have linked Canada and Normandy over the centuries are recorded on the monument. Mounted on the wall behind it is a plaque that commemorates the Raid on Dieppe:

:&quot;On 19 August 1942 on the beaches of Dieppe our Canadian cousins marked with their blood the road to our final liberation foretelling thus their victorious return on 1 September 1944.&quot; (translation from the French)

===Recent activities===
Members of the regiment have augmented Regular Force contingents on many operations including serving in the Balkans with United Nation forces (UNPROFOR) in the early 1990s and NATO from 1995-2006. Over the past decades members have also served in; Cyprus, the Golan Heights, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Congo, Haiti, Sudan, Dubai, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Iraq, Ukraine and Latvia. They were also on alert for the feared millennial or Y2K crisis which failed to materialise.

The City of Hamilton dedicated Dieppe Memorial Park in the Hamilton Beach neighbourhood on 19 August 2003, the 61st anniversary of the Dieppe Raid. Among the 250 invited guests and 1,000 onlookers were the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario and 18 of the 24 Riley Dieppe veterans known to survive.

In 2017 the RHLI received the StAR (Strengthening the Army Reserve) Mission Task of Influence Activities (IA). This is a mixture of Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) and Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC).

Current parade strength is approximately 200-250 all ranks, making the RHLI one of the largest reserve regiments in the CAF. The RHLI currently consists of; one rifle company, &quot;B&quot; Company (Hamilton), an IA Company, &quot;D&quot; Company (Burlington) and an administration company, &quot;A&quot; Company, also at battalion headquarters in Hamilton. Battalion structures are maintained throughout the militia to allow for expansion in time of war.

Officers and Soldiers from the RHLI deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Canadian Forces contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). This is the first time since the Second World War serving members from the regiment have taken part in combat operations. Most notably this included Operation Medusa in 2006. Members from the RHLI in Afghanistan served with Infantry Platoons, CIMIC &amp; PSY OPS teams, Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), Force Protection Units, Helicopter Door Gunner Sections, and Canadian Special Operations Forces.

==Battle honours==
Battle honours in small capitals are for large operations and campaigns and those in lowercase are for more specific battles. Bold type indicates honours authorized to be emblazoned on the regimental colour.

<text>The Ingøy radio transmitter was a longwave transmitter of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation with a frequency of 153 kHz and a power of 100 kW. It is located about south of the village of Ingøy on the island of Ingøya in Måsøy Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The current transmitter commenced service in 2000 transmitting the NRK P1 radio station and uses as antenna a guyed mast, which is grounded and fed over the guys with the radio power to be radiated. The mast is the tallest structure in Norway and Scandinavia. There was also a previous, unrelated transmitter at Ingøya which was built in 1911 and was mainly used to communicate with mining companies operating in Svalbard until the German occupation of Norway in 1940, after which it was taken over by the Luftwaffe. That transmitter was bombed by the Germans on 6 June 1940 and by the British on 22 August 1944.

Transmissions from the Ingøy radio transmitter ended on 2 December 2019 at 00:06 CET.

<text>Riverside is a neighborhood in the city of East Providence in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Despite not being an incorporated city, Riverside has its own zip code, 02915, and is an acceptable mailing address according to the United States Postal Service. Riverside has a population of approximately 20,000 people.

Adjoining Riverside are the town of Barrington in Bristol County to the south, Narragansett Bay to the west, the rest of East Providence to the north, and the Runnins River and Seekonk, Massachusetts to the east.

== History ==
Riverside, known as Cedar Grove until 1878, was originally a farming and fishing area. The streets south of the Maze are named for trees.

Riverside most notably became a tourist attraction in the late 19th and early 20th century due to the presence of Crescent Park Amusement Park, known as the “Coney Island of the East”. The 50 acre park operated from 1886 until 1979, and was famous for its Rhode Island Shore Dinners as well as the Alhambra Ballroom, where famous Big Bands played, and the bustling midway which included roller coasters, kiddie land, rides and games. Although the park in now gone, the famous 1895 Crescent Park Looff Carousel has been preserved and continues in operation every summer. The Carousel is nationally recognized as a true masterpiece of wood sculpture. Originally built as a showcase for prospective buyers, it is the largest and most elaborate of Looff&#x27;s works.

Two other amusement parks sprang up in the early 1900s in Riverside. Boyden Heights and Vanity Fair each had a short run before closing down due to low attendance.

Many hotels, guest houses and shore dinner halls operated in Riverside in the late 19th century to accommodate the influx of summer visitors escaping the big city. Also available were several tent sites like Camp White and Camp Fuller. The Vue de l&#x27;Eau Hotel was built around 1860. The four-story Riverside Hotel boasted its own wharf and a huge ballroom overlooking the bay. After a few years, it was dismantled and shipped by barge to Nantucket. Pomham House opened in 1867 with its own wharf. The popular Silver Spring Hotel was opened two years later by developer, Hiram Maxfield. In addition to the hotel, it included a shore dinner hall and summer cottages.

The Lyric Theater opened on Maple Avenue around 1920 and featured silent movies until 1928 when the theater became the second in the state to have talking pictures. Later named the Gilbert Stuart, it eventually closed as a theater. The Riverside Girl Scout House on Willett Avenue, built around 1870, is the oldest school still standing in East Providence. It was known as District 6 Schoolhouse.

Hockey star and NHL / U.S. Olympic hockey coach Ron Wilson lived in Riverside, at 47 Lottie Drive, from the ages of 12 until he was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Today, it is a close-knit and diverse community with several distinct neighborhoods.

== Tourism ==
The historic Little Neck Cemetery contains the grave of Thomas Willett, the first mayor of New York City and Elizabeth Tilley Howland (d.1687) who was a passenger as a child on the Mayflower.

The Squantum Club was founded in 1872 and many historic buildings are on the grounds. Its architectural uniqueness is noted on the National Register of Historic Places. The Colonial Revival Club House was built in 1900 and the one-story brick Bake House goes back to 1889. The association, with a diverse membership of area business leaders, hosts member and non-member events, is a famous wedding venue and still operates today.

Riversidians were known for harvesting clams, quahogs and oysters from the beaches and surrounding waters. They became known as &quot;Clam-diggers&quot;.

Narragansett Terrace, in the extreme south of town, was the site of many summer cottages for wealthy residents including Governor Case. This peninsula afforded a grand view of Narragansett Bay. Bullock&#x27;s Cove, nestled between the Terrace and Bay Spring, offered mooring sites for small boats. From this point one can see Barrington, Warren, Bristol, Warwick, Cranston, and Providence from the shore.

In the past decade, East Providence has considered many redevelopment projects.
The largest landowner in Riverside is ExxonMobil. There are also banking call centers for Bank of America and Citizens Bank. It is also home to Bradley Hospital and the Silver Spring Golf Course.

The major roads through Riverside are the Wampanoag Trail connecting East Providence to Bristol County, RI and Willett Ave, named after Captain Thomas Willett, the first English mayor of New York City (1665). Willett is buried in Riverside at the Little Neck Cemetery.

The East Bay Bike Path runs through the town, connecting Riverside with the rest of the Providence with bike access

<doc id="1249539" wikidata="Q4895689" url="?curid=1249539" title="Assassination of Danilo Anderson">
<text>The assassination of Danilo Anderson took place on 18 November 2004, in Caracas, Venezuela. Danilo Baltasar Anderson (born 29 October 1966) was a Venezuelan environmental state prosecutor investigating more than 400 people accused of crimes during the Llaguno Overpass events and the failed 2002 coup d&#x27;état attempt. He was assassinated by a car bomb on his way home from attending postgraduate classes at aged 38. In 2005 several people were convicted of masterminding the assassination, though the investigation had flaws and was marred with allegations of corruption.

==Background==

Anderson was born in Caracas and was raised in the slums. In the 1990s, he was a student agitator participating in clashes with police weekly with fellow demonstrators. He graduated in law from Central University of Venezuela in 1995, specializing later in criminology and environmental law. He worked as a lawyer for several firms, and was a general tax inspector between 1993 and 2000. He was the first official to bring a case for environmental offenses in Caracas. Anderson described himself as being a radical leftist and was a supporter of Hugo Chávez. His murder shocked Venezuelan opinion across the political spectrum.

Danilo Anderson was a high-profile prosecutor that participated often in political trials. Following the failure of the coup in April 2002, he prosecuted the responsibles of the Llaguno Overpass events and those who signed the Carmona Decree. Many accused Anderson of extorting money from those he threatened to prosecute in order to have their charges dropped.

Leaders of the political movements opposed to President Chávez had also turned to economic means to achieve their political goals following the 2002 coup attempt. For two months from early December 2002 they organized the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003, dominated by the near-closure of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA as a key oil transport route was blocked. The strike ultimately failed in its attempt to make President Chávez resign, but caused acute economic problems, with GDP falling by a quarter in early 2003, and deepened the conflictive political situation and polarization resulting from the Llaguno Overpass shootout and the April coup.

Following the collapse of the strike, opposition politicians focused on a recall referendum. Widespread international attention focused on the run-up to the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum in August 2004. President Chávez won the vote with 59% of the total.

==Death==
On 18 November 2004 at about 9:45 pm, Anderson was in Urbanización Los Chaguaramos in Caracas, driving home in his yellow Toyota Autana from the University Institute of Forensic Science where he was taking postgraduate classes. Anderson stopped at a street and as he accelerated, a military-grade C-4 plastic explosive device placed on the frame under the driver&#x27;s seat detonated from a wireless device killing Anderson instantly. The blast had such force that it broke windows in the vicinity and covered the street with glass. Witnesses say they heard two loud explosions and saw the vehicle, already in flames, roll into the front of a nearby building. Firefighters and CICPC investigators arrived at the scene shortly after the explosion. Anderson&#x27;s body was charred an unrecognizable and he had to be identified by his fingerprints and dental records. Anderson&#x27;s sister and girlfriend also helped identify him as the victim by recognizing personal belongings such as his Glock automatic pistol, two cell phones, his girlfriend&#x27;s photo, his wallet and a chain.

Within a few hours, many government officials had gathered at the scene and Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez began to mention Anderson&#x27;s involvement in the investigation of those who signed the Carmona Decree. The Venezuelan government and opposition, multiple national organizations and international bodies such as the OAS and the IACHR condemned the assassination.

==Investigation==
The investigation into who masterminded Anderson&#x27;s murder became one of the most controversial topics in Venezuelan politics. According to the United States Department of State, Anderson&#x27;s death was &quot;believed to be linked to his alleged extortion attempts, but the BRV [Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela] claims his death was part of a larger plot to destabilize the government&quot;. There were reports that friends of Anderson may have operated an extortion racket aimed at opposition figures being investigated by Anderson in relation to the 2002 coup and that Anderson or lawyers close to him &quot;were paid large bribes in a bid to ensure the acquittal of some civilians linked to the 2002 coup&quot;. Other reports claimed that Anderson was a member of an extortion ring himself and the members involved feared he was investigating them. Lifelong friend of Anderson and Caracas municipal council member, Carlos Herrera, stated &quot;The Danilo I first knew was a revolutionary without a cent to his name&quot; and stated that a few years before his death, Anderson did not even have a vehicle. Herrera explained that the Toyota Autana that Anderson was killed in was $70,000 and that he had recently purchased two personal water craft along with multiple apartments and farms.

Following the assassination, the Venezuelan government quickly blamed Venezuelan exiles in the United States for the murder. On 26 November 2004, two brothers Otoniel and Rolando Guevara were found by the National Guard wandering down a road in Valencia naked and tied after they had been seen earlier accompanied by about 10 armed individuals who had bound and gagged the brothers. Some reported that DISIP officers were the ones who had the Guevara brothers bound earlier and let them go so that they would be found and arrested legally, though the Venezuelan government denied such allegations. The two were arrested and both charged with homicide. The brothers stated that they were captured, drugged and then tortured before they were arrested. The same day the Guevara brothers were arrested two other suspects in the case, lawyer Antonio Lopez Castillo and, another former police agent, Juan Carlos Sanchez, were shot dead by investigating officers in separate incidents; both were said to have opened fire on the police, though relatives and lawyers stated that the two were executed by the police.

On 4 January 2005, Interior Minister Jesse Chacón stated that there was evidence of bribery and extortion linked to both Anderson and bankers that allegedly participated in the 2002 coup. A lawyer linked to Anderson, Sócrates Tiniacos, told police in an affidavit that he assisted Anderson&#x27;s girlfriend and her brother with removing about $60,000 from Anderson&#x27;s apartment safe following the assassination in order to cover up suspicious money from the police. Tiniacos also explained in his sworn statement that he saw two attorneys negotiating to keep a banker and coup suspect from being arrested and saw them give Anderson a bag full of U.S. dollars in a Caracas restaurant. Tiniacos said to police, &quot;Danilo got into his car with the package and left. I don&#x27;t know what he did with it&quot;. Later that month, Attorney General Isaías Rodríguez stated that police involved in the investigation &quot;shuffled the pieces of the puzzle&quot; to protect those suspected in Anderson&#x27;s death and replaced the investigative team for a second time. Rodríguez called the extortion evidence &quot;contradictory&quot; saying &quot;If we take away his medal and say Danilo was a crook, we are hurting Hugo Chávez.&quot;

The investigation eventually widened in search of the organizers and planners of the murder. By August 2005 the Venezuelan authorities had detained Giovani José Vásquez De Armas, a self-confessed former member of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), the Colombian right-wing paramilitary organization. In sworn testimony given on August 29, 2005, Vásquez de Armas declared that he had participated in two meetings to plan attacks against members of the Venezuelan government. He alleged that participants in the second meeting decided to target Danilo Anderson. After that second meeting Vásquez de Armas said he collected 12 kg of C4 plastic explosive in Panama and transported it to Venezuela.

On the basis of Vásquez De Armas&#x27; testimony, warrants were issued for the arrest of leading journalist Patricia Poleo, banker Nelson Mezerhane, retired general Eugenio Áñez Núñez and Salvador Romaní, as the &quot;intellectual authors&quot; of the assassination. Mezzerane, Áñez and Romaní turned themselves in and were granted bail in December 2005. Poleo did not present herself to the authorities; she was interviewed on a TV show in Peru in January 2006. Human rights groups, media advocates and members of the opposition accused the Venezuelan government of turning the investigation of Anderson&#x27;s murder into a political issue, using the case to harass government opponents. They stated that the accusations were an attempt to take away the freedom of the press.

On 20 December 2005, Otoniel and Rolando Guevara were sentenced to 27 years and 9 months imprisonment each, while their brother Juan Bautista was sentenced to the maximum 30 years.

=== Flaws ===
In 2006 the credibility of the key prosecution witness Vásquez De Armas came into question after it was shown he had a criminal record for identity fraud in his native Colombia and he was not a psychiatrist as he had pledged to be. Documentation of uncertain provenance was produced apparently showing that Vasquez de Armas was serving jail time in Santa Marta, Colombia, at the time he claims to have witnessed the planning of Anderson&#x27;s murder by leading opposition figures. Venezuela&#x27;s Attorney General Isaias Rodriguez moved to control press reporting on Vasquez de Armas while the case was sub-judice. The ban on discussing the personal life and alleged unreliability of Vásquez was lifted in August 2006. In August 2006, Isaias Rodríguez had to admit that Vasquez de Armes had actually lied. Armas also admitted to one journalist that the Venezuelan government &quot;paid him to fabricate his testimony&quot;.

Isaías Rodríguez was accused by the opposition to turn Anderson&#x27;s murder into a political witch hunt, using the case to harass government opponents.

<doc id="1249541" wikidata="Q504492" url="?curid=1249541" title="Water of crystallization">
<text>In chemistry, water(s) of crystallization or water(s) of hydration are water molecules that are present inside crystals. Water is often incorporated in the formation of crystals from aqueous solutions. In some contexts, water of crystallization is the total mass of water in a substance at a given temperature and is mostly present in a definite (stoichiometric) ratio. Classically, &quot;water of crystallization&quot; refers to water that is found in the crystalline framework of a metal complex or a salt, which is not directly bonded to the metal cation.
Upon crystallization from water, or water-containing solvents, many compounds incorporate water molecules in their crystalline frameworks. Water of crystallization can generally be removed by heating a sample but the crystalline properties are often lost.

Compared to inorganic salts, proteins crystallize with large amounts of water in the crystal lattice. A water content of 50% is not uncommon for proteins.

==Applications==
Knowledge of hydration is essential for calculating the masses for many compounds. The reactivity of many salt-like solids is sensitive to the presence of water.
The hydration and dehydration of salts is central to the use of phase-change materials for energy storage.

== Position in the crystal structure ==

A salt with associated water of crystallization is known as a hydrate. The structure of hydrates can be quite elaborate, because of the existence of hydrogen bonds that define polymeric structures.

Historically, the structures of many hydrates were unknown, and the dot in the formula of a hydrate was employed to specify the composition without indicating how the water is bound. Per IUPAC&#x27;s recommendations, the middle dot is not surrounded by spaces when indicating a chemical adduct. Examples:
* – copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate
* – cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate
* – tin(II) (&quot;or&quot; stannous) chloride dihydrate
For many salts, the exact bonding of the water is unimportant because the water molecules are made labile upon dissolution. For example, an aqueous solution prepared from and anhydrous behave identically. Therefore, knowledge of the degree of hydration is important only for determining the equivalent weight: one mole of weighs more than one mole of . In some cases, the degree of hydration can be critical to the resulting chemical properties. For example, anhydrous is not soluble in water and is relatively useless in organometallic chemistry whereas is versatile. Similarly, hydrated is a poor Lewis acid and thus inactive as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts reactions. Samples of must therefore be protected from atmospheric moisture to preclude the formation of hydrates.
Crystals of hydrated copper(II) sulfate consist of centers linked to ions. Copper is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, provided by two different sulfate groups and four molecules of water. A fifth water resides elsewhere in the framework but does not bind directly to copper. The cobalt chloride mentioned above occurs as and . In tin chloride, each Sn(II) center is pyramidal (mean angle is 83°) being bound to two chloride ions and one water. The second water in the formula unit is hydrogen-bonded to the chloride and to the coordinated water molecule. Water of crystallization is stabilized by electrostatic attractions, consequently hydrates are common for salts that contain +2 and +3 cations as well as −2 anions. In some cases, the majority of the weight of a compound arises from water. Glauber&#x27;s salt, , is a white crystalline solid with greater than 50% water by weight.

Consider the case of nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate. This species has the formula . Crystallographic analysis reveals that the solid consists of subunits that are hydrogen bonded to each other as well as two additional molecules of . Thus one third of the water molecules in the crystal are not directly bonded to , and these might be termed &quot;water of crystallization&quot;.

==Analysis==
The water content of most compounds can be determined with a knowledge of its formula. An unknown sample can be determined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) where the sample is heated strongly, and the accurate weight of a sample is plotted against the temperature. The amount of water driven off is then divided by the molar mass of water to obtain the number of molecules of water bound to the salt.

==Other solvents of crystallization==
Water is particularly common solvent to be found in crystals because it is small and polar. But &quot;all&quot; solvents can be found in some host crystals. Water is noteworthy because it is reactive, whereas other solvents such as benzene are considered to be chemically innocuous. Occasionally more than one solvent is found in a crystal, and often the stoichiometry is variable, reflected in the crystallographic concept of &quot;partial occupancy&quot;. It is common and conventional for a chemist to &quot;dry&quot; a sample with a combination of vacuum and heat &quot;to constant weight&quot;.

For other solvents of crystallization, analysis is conveniently accomplished by dissolving the sample in a deuterated solvent and analyzing the sample for solvent signals by NMR spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray crystallography is often able to detect the presence of these solvents of crystallization as well. Other methods may be currently available.

==Table of crystallization water in some inorganic halides==
In the table below are indicated the number of molecules of water per metal in various salts.
Examples are rare for second and third row metals. No entries exist for Mo, W, Tc, Ru, Os, Rh, Ir, Pd, Hg, Au. AuCl3(H2O) has been invoked but its crystal structure has not been reported.

==Hydrates of metal sulfates==
Transition metal sulfates form a variety of hydrates, each of which crystallizes in only one form. The sulfate group often binds to the metal, especially for those salts with fewer than six aquo ligands. The heptahydrates, which are often the most common salts, crystallize as monoclinic and the less common orthorhombic forms. In the heptahydrates, one water is in the lattice and the other six are coordinated to the ferrous center. Many of the metal sulfates occur in nature, being the result of weathering of mineral sulfides. Many monohydrates are known.

==Hydrates of metal nitrates==
Transition metal nitrates form a variety of hydrates. The nitrate anion often binds to the metal, especially for those salts with fewer than six aquo ligands. Nitrates are uncommon in nature, so few minerals are represented here. Hydrated ferrous nitrate has not been characterized crystallographically.

<text>Jean Joseph Antoine de Couvoisier (30 November 1775 – 18 September 1835) was a French magistrate and politician.

==Early life==
Couvoisier was born at Besançon on 30 November 1775. During the revolutionary period, he left the country and served in the army of the &quot;émigrés&quot; and later in that of Austria.

== Career ==
In 1801, under the consulate, he returned to France and established himself as an advocate at Besançon, being appointed conseiller-auditeur to the court of appeal therein 1808. At the Restoration he was made advocate-general by Louis XVIII, resigned and left France during the Hundred Days, and was reappointed after the second Restoration in 1815.

In 1817, after the modification of the constitution by the ordonnance of the 5 September, he was returned to the chamber of deputies, where he attached himself to the left centre and supported the moderate policy of Richelieu and Decazes. He was an eloquent speaker, and master of many subjects; and his proved royalism made it impossible for the Ultra-Royalists to discredit him, much as they resented his consistent opposition to their short-sighted violence.

After the revolt at Lyon, he was nominated procureur-general of the city, and by his sense and moderation did much to restore order and confidence. He was again a member of the chamber from 1819 to 1824, and vigorously opposed the exceptional legislation which the second administration of Richelieu passed under the influence of the ultra-Royalists.

In 1824, he failed to secure re-election, and occupied himself with his judicial duties until his nomination as councilor of state in 1827. On 8 August 1829, he accepted the offer of the portfolio of justice in the Polignac ministry, but resigned on 19 May 1830, when he realized that the government intended to abrogate the Charter and the inevitable revolution that would follow. During the trial of the ex-ministers, in December, he was summoned as a witness, and paid a tribute to the character of his former colleagues which, in the circumstances, argued no little courage. He refused to take office under Louis Philippe, and retired into private life, dying on 18 September 1835.

<text>Preševo (, ; , ) is a town and municipality located in the Pčinja District of southern Serbia. As of the 2022 census, the municipality has a population of 33,449 inhabitants. It is the southernmost town in Central Serbia and largest in the geographical region of Preševo Valley.

Preševo is the cultural center of Albanians in Serbia. Albanians form the ethnic majority of the municipality, followed by Serbs, Roma and other ethnic groups.

==History==

Slavs arrived roughly in the 7th century, when they first migrated to the Balkans, and by the Middle Ages, Preševo was part of the Kingdom of Serbia. According to Stefan Dušan&#x27;s charter to the monastery of Arhiljevica dated August 1355, &quot;sevastokrator&quot; Dejan possessed a large province east of Skopska Crna Gora. It included the old &quot;župe&quot; (counties) of Žegligovo and Preševo (modern Kumanovo region with Sredorek, Kozjačija and the larger part of Pčinja). As &quot;despot&quot; under the rule of Uroš V, Dejan was entrusted with the administration of the territory between South Morava, Pčinja, Skopska Crna Gora (hereditary lands) and in the east, the Upper Struma river with Velbuzhd, a province notably larger than during Dušan&#x27;s life. After the death of Dejan, his province, besides the &quot;župe&quot; of Žegligovo and Upper Struma, was appropriated to nobleman Vlatko Paskačić. Dejan&#x27;s eldest son Jovan also received the title of &quot;despot&quot;, like his father before, by Emperor Uroš. In the new redistribution of feudal power, after 1371, the brothers despot Jovan and gospodin Konstantin greatly expanded their province. Not only did they recreate their father&#x27;s province but also at least doubled the territory, on all sides, but chiefly towards the south. Ottoman sources report that in 1373, the Ottoman army compelled Jovan (who they called &quot;Saruyar&quot;) in the upper Struma, to recognize Ottoman vassalage. As Prince Marko had done, also the Dejanović brothers recognized Ottoman sovereignty. Although vassals, they had their own government. In the Wallachian victory at the Battle of Rovine (17 May 1395), both Marko and Konstantin died. The provinces of Marko and Konstantin became Ottoman.

From 1877 to 1913 Preševo was part of Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. According to the statistics of the Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov from 1900 the settlement is recorded as Prešovo as having 2000 inhabitants, all Albanian Muslims. Following the First Balkan War in 1912, Kingdom of Serbia conquered the area.

===Yugoslavia (1918–92)===
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. From 1929 to 1941 Preševo was part of the Vardar Banovina.

During the April War the Kingdom of Yugoslavia capitulated after 12 days of war against the Axis Powers. On April 20, Bulgaria occupied part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including Preševo. The royal authoritarian dictatorship of Bulgaria occupied the area until September 7, 1944, when they handed the area over to Nazi Germany. The Albanian collaborationist regime along with Balli Kombëtar subsequently took over the area. In mid-November, the Partisans forced the Balli Kombëtar to retreat.

From 1945 until 1992 Preševo was part of Socialist Republic of Serbia, within SFR Yugoslavia.

===Breakup of Yugoslavia (1991–99)===
In 1992, the Albanians in the area organized a referendum in which they voted that Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac should join the self-declared assembly of the Republic of Kosova. However, no major events happened until the end of the 1990s.

During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, a total of 161 depleted uranium bullets have been recovered in Reljan near Preševo in southern Serbia. The Serbian government has funded the cleanup operation of the Reljan site with 350,000 euros.

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, and nearby Kosovo War which lasted until 1999, between 1999 and 2001, an ethnic Albanian paramilitary separatist organization, the UÇPMB, raised an armed insurgency in the Preševo Valley, in the region mostly inhabited by Albanians, with a goal to occupy these three municipalities from Serbia and join them to the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosova.

Following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, the new Serbian government suppressed the violence by 2001 and defeated the separatists. NATO troops also helped the Serbian government by ensuring that the rebels do not import the conflicts back into Kosovo.

In 2009, Serbia opened a military base Cepotina 5 kilometers south of Bujanovac, to further stabilize the area.

===Modern===
Today, Preševo is located in the Pčinja District of southern Serbia.

On 7 March 2017, the President of Albania Bujar Nishani made a visit to the municipalities of Bujanovac and Preševo, in which Albanians form the ethnic majority.

As a result, only 3,080 were inhabitants were registered. As of 2022 census, the municipality has a population of 33,449 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the census conducted in 2002, Albanians form nearly 90% of the municipality, and over 95% of the town. Most of the remainder of its inhabitants are Serbs, who are mainly concentrated in the settlements of Ljanik, Svinjište, Slavujevac and Cakanovac. The rest of the settlements have an absolute Albanian majority.

==Politics==

===Elections===
In December 2005, the leader of the Albanian Democratic party (PDSH) Ragmi Mustafa became the president of the municipality. He was re-elected several times and served as the president of the municipality until 2016.

On 7 March 2017, the President of Albania Bujar Nishani made a historical visit to the municipalities of Preševo and Bujanovac, in which Albanians form the ethnic majority. Three days later, Ardita Sinani became the president of the municipality of Preševo, following the resignation of Shqiprim Arifi due to the termination of the municipal coalition.

===Stele controversies 2012–13===

On 21 November 2012, the municipality council of Preševo erected a stele in the center of the town honouring members of the former UÇPMB, who died during the Preševo Valley Conflict from 1999 to 2001, causing a public outcry throughout Serbia. The Prime Minister of Serbia, Ivica Dačić, said about this incident: &quot;It&#x27;s best that they remove it themselves, because this is a needless provocation, nowhere else in Europe can a memorial plaque be erected to those who are members of terrorist organizations and those who were directly involved in the murders of police officers and soldiers&quot;. 
He called for the removal of the stele to 17 January, then several Albanian politicians and organizations responded with criticism. Mayor of Preševo Ragmi Mustafa said that the stele shows the identity of the Albanians in the region and announced that it would end the cooperation with national authorities of Serbia if the monument were removed. Serbian Minister of Defence Aleksandar Vučić announced that they will act in frame of the law in connection with the controversial stele, and that no one can act against the for all the same applicable constitution and seeks the reason in ethnicity. He added that Serbia wants peace but will respond to any provocation.

Deputies of the Assembly of Kosovo Rexhep Selimi and Nait Hasani, a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UÇK), threatened armed conflict if the institutions of Serbia removed the memorial plaque. 
The former U.S. diplomat, United Nations regional representative of Mitrovica Gerard Gallucci said: &quot;Serbs, do not fall for provocations like this with the memorial plaque in Preševo&quot;. President of the National Assembly of Serbia Nebojša Stefanović explained that it is unacceptable that in Serbia there is a memorial plaque to a terrorist organization and those who killed the citizens of Serbia. He added that is not an ethnic conflict, but the problem is the honoring of those who killed Serbs with a memorial plaque in Serbia. Nevertheless, a member of the Coalition of Albanians of the Preševo Valley, Jonuz Musliu, which has one seat in the Parliament of Serbia, said that the stele would not be removed. However, the stele was removed by a bulldozer which was guarded by members of the Serbian Gendarmery on 20 January 2013. Despite threats from various Albanian nationalist organizations, there were no incidents during and after the removal.

As a first reaction, the former commander of UÇPMB, Orhan Rexhepi, made the separatist statement that this is a &quot;historic day&quot;, because &quot;Preševo and Bujanovac will be a part of Kosovo.&quot; Ragmi Mustafa, Preševo&#x27;s Mayor, confirmed shortly afterwards that the Albanians want a union with Kosovo for a long time.

The former president of the National Council for Cooperation with the Hague Tribunal and a minister in Serbian government Rasim Ljajić responded and said that the Preševo valley will not be part of Kosovo or may be because the Albanian representatives from southern Serbia do not have the support of the international community. He also warned against the exploitation of the situation by the Albanians. The operation of the Serbian police broke into the local population from turmoil. During the day, several hundred people gathered at the site of the stele laid flowers and candles in memory of the fallen UÇPMB members. The Albanian prime minister Sali Berisha announced that &quot;the Albanian government calls the international institutions to stop this action&quot;, even though the U.S. had already announced earlier that it is an internal affair of Serbia, which should solve their elected representatives.

On the evening of 20 January, a group of Albanians who protested against the removal of the stele gathered in Gjakova. Some of them tried forcibly to enter in the Serbian monastery of the Holy Virgin, where several nuns still live, but the attack was prevented by the KFOR and Kosovo police. On the night of 21 January, it overlapped to the Serbian enclave Goraždevac, were the monuments of the Serb victims of the NATO bombing in 1999, and the Serbian children who were shot at the Bistrica river by Albanians in 2003, desecrated and destroyed. Thousands of Preševo citizens rallied on 21 January 2013, to protest the removal of the stele dedicated to Albanian guerrillas. Serbian prime minister Ivica Dačić said that there was no reason for any kind of protests, the illicit stele was not destroyed, nor was violence used. He added that &quot;I doubt that in the United States, Al-Qaeda veterans, or those who have carried out several terrorist attacks in London or Paris, would decide whether a memorial stele should be built.&quot; The Albanian prime minister Sali Berisha announced during a press conference in Tirana, that Albania would review its relations with Serbia, if that is necessary. He also stated that the Albanian government will do everything in his power to help the Albanians in Serbia. Albin Kurti, leader of the political party &quot;Vetëvendosje&quot; said instead, that the most responsible for this situation is more likely in Kosovo, the government of Hashim Thaçi.

In response to the removal of the stele, dozens of Albanians, led by former UÇK veterans, destroyed a memorial plaque from the World War II in Viti with a crane, and were not prevented by the Kosovo Police. Till the evening of 21 January over 140 Serbian gravestones were destroyed throughout Kosovo, burned a chapel and several crosses. Subsequently, representatives of the United States, European Union, as well as the OSCE, KFOR and EULEX, sharply condemned the destruction of Serbian monuments and tombs. They added that there is no justification for this violence, and that such actions were totally unacceptable.

==Culture==
The Abdulla Krashnica Culture Center &quot;(Shtëpia e Kulturës &quot;Abdulla Krashnica&quot;)&quot; is the home to various culture events in Preševo. Its complex includes the town library, music hall and theater. 
Preševo organizes the annual &quot;Netët e komedisë&quot; (The nights of comedy), a one–week festival with comedy shows from all the Albanian-speaking territories. The festival was first organized in 1994.

There are some natural heritage sites in Preševa Valley like: (&quot;Shpella e Ilincës&quot;), (&quot;Shpella e Arushës&quot;), (&quot;Trungu i Çarrit&quot;), (&quot;Burimi i ujit në Banjke&quot;), (&quot;Ujëndarësi i Preshevës&quot;). There has been some criticism, and Arsim Ejupi in his work Kërkime Gjeografike from 2013, claims that until now there were no activities regarding the protection and management of this natural heritage sites, and that this situation is a result of lack of capacities in local government and NGOs regarding the professional treatment of environmental issues. He considers that only with active participation of these actors it can be realized protection and sustainable management of natural heritage in Preševo Valley and the development of ecotourism in the region of Preševo Valley.

<doc id="1249554" wikidata="Q15627128" url="?curid=1249554" title="Program trading">
<text>Program trading is a type of trading in securities, usually consisting of baskets of fifteen stocks or more that are executed by a computer program simultaneously based on predetermined conditions. Program trading is often used by hedge funds and other institutional investors pursuing index arbitrage or other arbitrage strategies. There are essentially two reasons to use program trading, either because of the desire to trade many stocks simultaneously (for example, when a mutual fund receives an influx of money it will use that money to increase its holdings in the multiple stocks which the fund is based on), or alternatively to arbitrage temporary price discrepancies between related financial instruments, such as between an index and its constituent parts.

According to the New York Stock Exchange, in 2006 program trading accounts for about 30% and as high as 46.4% of the trading volume on that exchange every day. Barrons breaks down its weekly figures for program trading between index arbitrage and other types of program trading. As of July 2012, program trading made up about 25% of the volume on the NYSE; index arbitrage made up less than 1%.

==History==
Several factors help to explain the explosion in program trading. Technological advances spawned the growth of electronic communication networks. These electronic exchanges, like Instinet and Archipelago Exchange, allow thousands of buy and sell orders to be matched very rapidly, without human intervention.

In addition, the proliferation of hedge funds with all their sophisticated trading strategies have helped drive program-trading volume.

As technology advanced and access to electronic exchanges became easier and faster, program trading developed into the much broader algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading strategies employed by the investment banks and hedge funds.

==Program trading firms==
Program Trading is a strategy normally used by large institutional traders. Barrons shows a detailed breakdown of the NYSE-published program trading figures each week, giving the figures for the largest program trading firms (such as investment banks).

==Index arbitrage==
Index Arbitrage is a particular type of Program Trading which attempts to profit from price discrepancies between the basket of stocks which make up a stock index and its derivatives (such as the future based on that index). As of July 2012, it makes up less than 5% of the active Program Trading volume on the NYSE daily.

===Premium buy and sell execution levels===
The &quot;premium&quot; (PREM) or &quot;spread&quot; is the difference between the stock index future fair value and the actual index level. As the derivative is based on the index, the two should normally have a very close relationship. If there is a sufficiently large difference the arbitraging program will attempt to buy the relatively cheap level (whether that is the basket of stocks which make up the index or the index future) and sell the relatively expensive product, making money from the price discrepancy. The fair value calculation takes into account the time to expiration of the future contract, the dividends received from holding all the stocks, and the interest cost of buying the stocks.

== Regulations ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, program trading has been subject to regulation and oversight in response to concerns about its impact on market stability and volatility. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) introduced rules known as trading curbs or circuit breakers to address extreme volatility caused by program trading during the 1980s and 90s. Depending on the severity of price movements, these rules can lead to the halt of all program trading or restrict the trading of sell portfolios to upticks only.

In addition to NYSE rules, regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have established rules governing algorithmic trading strategies, including high-frequency trading (HFT). FINRA Rule 3110 (Supervision) outlines the regulatory requirements for member firms engaged in algorithmic strategies.

=== China ===
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has introduced a monitoring and reporting mechanism for program trading in Chinese stock markets in 2023. Stock exchanges in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing will implement rules on program trading and establish reporting systems to monitor unusual activities. These measures are set to take effect on October 9, 2023. The move comes in response to concerns about the role of computer-generated algorithms in stock trading, which have been blamed for exacerbating sell-offs in China&#x27;s struggling stock markets.

<doc id="1249559" wikidata="Q692488" url="?curid=1249559" title="Via Clodia">
<text>The Via Clodia was an ancient high road of Italy. Situated between the Via Cassia and the Via Aurelia, it is different from them notably in that the latter was designed primarily for military long-haul, irrespective of settlements they met, but the Via Clodia was of short-range, intended for commercial traffic with the colonies in Etruscan lands.

Its origin is uncertain, but most scholars agree that it was built by the Romans on an existing Etruscan route (between Pitigliano, Sorano and Sovana) on the path of the existing Etruscan &quot;Via Cava&quot;). However we can speak of the Via Clodia from the end of the 3rd century BC, and that from 225 BC it was paved. The existing road was probably used as a way of penetration and conquest of Etruria by the Roman army begun in 310 BC. The road never seems to have had heavy traffic, only connecting Rome with Etruria inner north-western cities. The stretch between Bracciano and Oriolo Romano continues a straight line whose paving stones are found here and there, often uprooted. Some basalt sections appear in the territory of Tuscania, Oriolo Romano, Vejano and Blera.

Its course, for the first 11 miles, was the same as that of the Via Cassia; it then diverged in a northwest direction and ran on the west side of the Lacus Sabatinus, past Forum Clodii and Blera. According to some it ended in Saturnia. At Forum Cassii it may have rejoined the Via Cassia, and it seems to have taken the same line as the latter as far as Florentia (Florence). However, beyond Florentia, between Luca (Lucca) and Luna, we find another Forum Clodii, and the Antonine itinerary gives the route from Luca to Rome as being by the Via Clodia, wrongly as regards the portion from Florentia southwards, but perhaps rightly as regards that from Luca to Florentia. Clodius Vestalis was perhaps responsible for the construction of the first portion and of that from Florentia to Luca (and Luna). Moreover, he also founded the two Fora Clodii. The name seems, in imperial times, to have to some extent driven out that of the Cassia, and both roads were administered, with other minor roads, by the same curator.

== Via Clodia Nova ==

The Via Clodia Nova extension was constructed in 183 BC by the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus. It started from Lucca and climbed the valley on the right bank of the river Serchio, crossed the Garfagnana region to the Piazza al Serchio, then passed over the col of Tea (955m) and through Fosdinovo before joining the Via Cassia, Luni and the port.

== Stages ==
According to the Tabula Peutingeriana, the stages on the Via Clodia are:

*&quot;Sextum&quot; (in the current area of Rome called The Retort and where the Via Cassia separated)
*&quot;Careias&quot; (in the current area of Rome called Santa Maria di Galeria)
*&quot;ad Nonas&quot; (near Vigna di Valle)
*&quot;Forum Clodii&quot; (near San Liberato di Bracciano)
*&quot;Olera&quot; (Blera)
*&quot;Tuscana&quot; (Tuscania)
*&quot;Marta&quot; (on Lake Bolsena)
*&quot;Maternum&quot; (Canino or Ischia di Castro)

<text>The Richtfunkstelle Berlin-Frohnau (Directional radio station Berlin-Frohnau) was a facility for directional radio services in Frohnau (a locality in the Reinickendorf borough of Berlin; during the Cold War, the northernmost locality of West Berlin). Before German reunification, the facility served as a microwave transmission link between West Berlin and West Germany.

It first used only an overhorizon directional link. For this link between 1970 and 1973 a 117.5 m high free-standing steelframe work tower was built. This tower was equipped with parabolic dishes of 18 m diameter for an overhorizon link to Gartow in Lower Saxony.

From 1977 onward a 358.6 m high guyed mast for conventional directional service was built. It carries on a platform aerials for directional services toward Gartow and Clenze, both in Lower Saxony.

At a height of 300 metres, there was a room for technical equipment measuring 4 by 5 metres. This room was the highest floor of all structures in the European Union at the time of the tower&#x27;s demolition.

Since 2002 there have been test transmissions for DRM on the medium wave frequency 1485 kHz. Because neither of the towers was designed for use as aerial for AM transmission, a long wire aerial on a 10 m high mast was built.

The radio mast was demolished on February 8, 2009 shortly after 1pm local time.

<text>Sir John Bertram Adams (24 May 1920 – 3 March 1984) was an English accelerator physicist and administrator.

Adams is mostly known for his work at CERN and Culham Laboratory. Despite a lack of formal university education, Adams worked for organizations like the Telecommunications Research Establishment and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in the 1940s and early 1950s. He served as acting director and eventually as elected director of CERN, from 1976 until 1981.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born in Kingston, Surrey on 24 May 1920. He attended Eltham College from 1931 until 1936, after which he began to work for Siemens Laboratories in Woolwich. He continued studying at the South East London Technical Institute until 1939 earning a Higher National Certificate. Adams received no university education.

=== Professional career ===
At Siemens, his work was concerned with the acoustic properties of telephones. Between 1940 and 1945, he worked the Telecommunications Research Establishment being particularly responsible for developing the microwave radar After, Adams moved to the Atomic Energy Research Establishment until 1953. In 1953, he moved once more to the new CERN Laboratory, serving in the General Physics Division as the engineer in charge of designing and building the Harwell Synchrocyclotron, Europe&#x27;s first large accelerator which operated successfully for 30 years until shutdown due to lack of funding. Also in late 1953, he was noted serving as a full staff member of the Proton Synchrotron Group. As CERN&#x27;s proton synchrotron became fully operational in 1959, Adams was important to defining the methods and organization by which physicists would conduct testing. His work organizing CERN&#x27;s administrative structure and measurement equipment were prepared for experimentation leading up until the synchrotron&#x27;s start up at the end of 1959. After the death of Prof. C. J. Bakker, CERN Director-General, in April 1960, the Council of CERN appointed Adams to the post of acting Director-General. He held this post until August 1961 when he returned to the UK as director of the Culham Fusion Laboratory, and then from 1966 to 1971 he was a member of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. He also became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Returning to CERN in 1971 as Director-General of Laboratory II, he led the design of the Super Proton Synchrotron. He split the duties of CERN Director General with Willibald Jentschke and then Léon Van Hove during the 1970s. His careful management of CERN&#x27;s new projects were important to getting funding and approval from CERN&#x27;s council. His designs were cautious and focused on reliability while providing the ability for new improvements to be built. The Super Proton Synchrotron was able to reach energies of 540 GeV. With the reorganization of CERN in 1976, he became the executive Director-General, working on obtaining funding for the LEP collider. The new collider used magnet systems for acceleration that were designed by Adams in his previous accelerators. 

He was chair of the International Committee for Future Accelerators, a working group of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, from 1978 to 1982.

Adams was knighted in 1981.

=== Personal life ===
Adams married Renie Warburton on 24 January 1943. They had two daughters and a son . He resided in Founex (Vaud), Switzerland.

== Awards and honors ==

<doc id="1249574" wikidata="Q2646503" url="?curid=1249574" title="Hart Island">
<text>Hart Island, sometimes referred to as Hart&#x27;s Island, is located at the western end of Long Island Sound, in the northeastern Bronx in New York City. Measuring approximately long by wide, Hart Island is part of the Pelham Islands archipelago and is east of City Island.

The island&#x27;s first public use was as a training ground for the United States Colored Troops in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a Union Civil War prison camp, a psychiatric institution, a tuberculosis sanatorium, a potter&#x27;s field used for both individual and mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys&#x27; reformatory and workhouse, a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the Cold War, Nike defense missiles were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967; the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The potter&#x27;s field on Hart Island was run by the New York City Department of Correction until 2019, when the New York City Council voted to transfer jurisdiction to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

The remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island. Since the first decade of the 21st century, however, there have been fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims. Access to the island was restricted by the Department of Correction, which operated an infrequent ferryboat service and imposed strict visitation quotas. Burials were conducted by inmates from the nearby Rikers Island jail until 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hart Island Project, a public charity founded by visual artist Melinda Hunt, worked to improve access to the island and make burial records more easily available. Transfer to the Parks Department in 2019 had been sought for over twenty years and was hoped to ease public access to the Island. Burials in the island&#x27;s Potters&#x27; Field continued after the transfer.

== Toponymy ==
There are numerous theories about the origins of the island&#x27;s place name. One theory posits that British cartographers named it &quot;Heart Island&quot; in 1775 due to its organ-like shape but the &#x27;e&#x27; was dropped shortly after. A map drawn in 1777 and subsequent maps refer to the island as &quot;Hart Island&quot;. Other names given to the island during the late 18th century were &quot;Little Minneford Island&quot; and &quot;Spectacle Island&quot;, the latter because the island&#x27;s shape was thought to resemble spectacles.

Another theory, based on the meaning of the English word &quot;hart&quot;, which means &quot;stag&quot;, is that the island was named when it was used as a game reserve. Another version holds that it was named in reference to deer that migrated from the mainland during periods when ice covered that part of Long Island Sound.

== Geography ==
Hart Island is approximately long by wide at its widest point. It lies about off the eastern shore of City Island. The island&#x27;s area is disputed; according to some sources, it is , while others state that it is . Hart Island is isolated from the rest of the city: there is no electricity and the only means of access is via ferryboat.

==History==
=== Early history ===

Before European colonization, Hart Island was occupied by the Siwanoy tribe of Native Americans, who were indigenous to the area. In 1654, English physician Thomas Pell purchased the island from the Siwanoy as part of a property. Pell died in 1669 and ownership passed to his nephew Sir John Pell, the son of British mathematician John Pell. The island remained in the Pell family until 1774, when it was sold to Oliver De Lancey. It was later sold to the Rodman, Haight, and Hunter families, in that order. According to Elliott Gorn, Hart Island had become &quot;a favorite pugilistic hideaway&quot; by the early 19th century. Bouts of bare-knuckle boxing held on the island could draw thousands of spectators.

The first public use of Hart Island was training the 31st Infantry Regiment of the United States Colored Troops beginning in 1864. A steamboat called &quot;John Romer&quot; shuttled recruits to the island from the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan. A commander&#x27;s house and a recruits&#x27; barracks were built; the barracks included a library and a concert room; it could house 2,000 to 3,000 recruits at a time, and over 50,000 men were ultimately trained there.

In November 1864, construction of a prisoner-of-war camp on Hart Island with room for 5,000 prisoners started. The camp was used for four months in 1865 during the American Civil War. The island housed 3,413 captured Confederate Army soldiers. Of these, 235 died in the camp and were buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery. Following the Civil War, indigent veterans were buried on the island in soldier&#x27;s plots, which were separate from the potter&#x27;s field and at the same location. Some of these soldiers were moved to West Farms Soldiers Cemetery in 1916 and others were removed to Cypress Hills Cemetery in 1941.

===Addition of cemetery===
The first burials on Hart Island were those of 20 Union Army soldiers during the American Civil War. On May 27, 1868, New York City purchased the island for $75,000 from Edward Hunter, who also owned the nearby Hunter Island. City burials started shortly afterward. In 1869, a 24-year-old woman named Louisa Van Slyke, who died in Charity Hospital, was the first person to be buried in the island&#x27;s public graveyard. The cemetery then became known as &quot;City Cemetery&quot; and &quot;Potter&#x27;s Field&quot;.

By 1880, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the island as &quot;the Green-Wood of Five Points&quot;, comparing an expansive cemetery in Brooklyn with a historically poor neighborhood in Manhattan. The newspaper also said of Hart Island, &quot;This is where the rough pine boxes go that come from Blackwell&#x27;s Island&quot;, in reference to the influx of corpses being transported from the hospitals on modern-day Roosevelt Island. The potter&#x27;s field on Hart Island replaced two previous potter&#x27;s fields on the current sites of Washington Square Park and New York Public Library Main Branch in Manhattan. The number of burials on Hart Island exceeded 500,000 by 1958.

=== Juxtaposition of uses ===

Hart Island was used as a quarantine station during the 1870 yellow fever epidemic. In that period, the island contained a women&#x27;s psychiatric hospital called The Pavilion, which was built 1885, as well as a tubercularium. There was also an industrial school with 300 students on the island. After an 1892 investigation found the city&#x27;s asylums were overcrowded, it was proposed to expand those on Hart Island from 1,100 to 1,500 beds.
In the late 19th century, Hart Island became the location of a boys&#x27; workhouse, which was an extension of the prison and almshouse on Blackwell Island. A workhouse for men was established in 1895, and was followed by a workhouse for young boys ten years later. By the early 20th century, Hart Island housed about 2,000 delinquent boys as well as elderly male prisoners from Blackwell&#x27;s penitentiary. The prison on Hart Island grew; it had its own band and a Catholic prison chapel. The cornerstone for the $60,000 chapel was laid in 1931 and it was opened the following year.

In 1924, John Hunter sold his tract of land on Hart Island&#x27;s west side to Solomon Riley, a millionaire real estate speculator from Barbados. Riley subsequently proposed to build an amusement park on Hart Island, which would have served the primarily black community of Harlem in Manhattan. It was referred to as the &quot;Negro Coney Island&quot; because at the time, African Americans were banned from the Rye Playland and Dobbs Ferry amusement parks in the New York City area. Riley had started building a dance hall, boardinghouses, and a boardwalk, and purchased sixty steamboats for the operation. The state government raised concerns about the proposed park&#x27;s proximity to a jail and hospital, and the city condemned the land in 1925. Riley was later paid $144,000 for the seizure.

=== After World War II ===
The prison population of Hart Island was moved to Rikers Island during World War II, and Hart Island&#x27;s former workhouse was used as a disciplinary barracks by the United States Armed Forces. Rikers Island soon became overcrowded with prisoners. The New York City Department of Correction reopened Hart Island as a prison following the war, but the facilities were considered inadequate. The New York City Board of Estimate approved the construction of a homeless shelter on the island in 1950; it was intended to serve 2,000 people. The homeless shelter operated from 1951 to 1954; it was also used to house alcoholics. Residents of nearby City Island opposed the inclusion of the homeless shelter. The New York City Welfare Department closed the homeless shelter and the Department of Correction regained control of the island. The Department of Correction opened an alcoholism treatment center on Hart Island in 1955. A courthouse, which ruled on cases involving the homeless, was opened on Hart Island. The island housed between 1,200 and 1,800 prisoners serving short sentences of between 10 days and two years.

In 1956, the island was retrofitted with Nike Ajax missile silos. Battery NY-15, as the silos were known, were part of the United States Army base Fort Slocum from 1956 to 1961 and were operated by the army&#x27;s 66th Antiaircraft Artillery Missile Battalion. The silos were underground and were powered by large generators. Some silos were also built on Davids Island. The integrated fire control system that tracked the targets and directed missiles was at Fort Slocum. The last components of the missile system were closed in 1974.

Construction of a new $7 million workhouse on Hart Island to replace the existing facility was announced in 1959. A baseball field was dedicated at the Hart Island prison the following year. It was named Kratter Field, after Marvin Kratter, a businessman who had donated 2,200 seats saved from the demolished Ebbets Field stadium. The seats deteriorated after being outdoors for several years, and by 2000, had been donated to various people and organizations.

The island continued to be used as a prison until 1966, when the prison was closed due to changes in the penal code. After it closed, a drug rehabilitation center was proposed for Hart Island. The center became Phoenix House, which opened in 1967; it quickly grew into a settlement with 350 residents and a vegetable garden. Phoenix House hosted festivals that sometimes attracted crowds of more than 10,000 people. Phoenix House published a newsletter known as &quot;The Hart Beat&quot; and organized baseball games against other organizations such as City Island&#x27;s and NBC&#x27;s teams. In 1977, after regular ferry service to Hart Island ended, Phoenix House moved from the island to a building in Manhattan.

Since then, proposals to re-inhabit the island have failed. In 1972, the city considered converting it into a residential resort but the plan was abandoned. New York City mayor Ed Koch created a workhouse on the island for persons charged with misdemeanors in 1982 but not enough prisoners were sent there. Six years later, another proposal called for a homeless shelter and a workhouse to be built on Hart Island, but this plan was abandoned because of opposition from residents of City Island.

=== Use as cemetery, abandonment of structures ===
Originally, City Cemetery occupied on the northern and southern tips of Hart Island, while the center two-thirds of the island was habitable. In 1985, sixteen bodies of people who died from AIDS were buried in deep graves on a remote section of the southern tip of the island because at the time it was feared that their remains may be contagious. An unnamed infant victim of AIDS is buried in the only single grave on Hart Island with a concrete marker that reads SC (special case) B1 (Baby 1) 1985. Since then, thousands of people who have died of AIDS have been buried on Hart Island, but the precise number is unknown.

From 1991 to 1993, New York artist Melinda Hunt and photographer Joel Sternfeld photographed Hart Island for their book of the same name, which was published in 1998. Hunt subsequently founded the Hart Island Project organization in 1994 to help the families and friends of those buried on Hart Island. Another media work, the 2018 documentary &quot;One Million American Dreams&quot;, documents the history of Hart Island and delves briefly into the lives of various individuals buried there.

Prior to the 2022 demolitions, there had been a section of old wooden houses and masonry institutional structures dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but these buildings had fallen into disrepair. Military barracks from the Civil War period were used prior to the construction of a workhouse and of hospital facilities.

In the late 2010s, the Hart Island Project and City Island Historical Society started petitioning for Hart Island to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation labeled the island a &quot;site of historical significance&quot; in 2016, given that Hart Island met three of the four criteria for being listed on the NRHP. The island was significantly affected by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and some of the shoreline was eroded, which exposed many of the skeletons buried on the island. Following this, the city announced a restoration of the shoreline. The federal government gave $13.2 million toward the shoreline project in 2015, but the work was delayed for several years. The start of restoration was initially slated for 2020, but in August 2019, the city announced that shoreline work would begin the following month.

=== Transfer to NYC Parks ===
Control of the island passed to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) in December 2019. Burials in the Potters&#x27; Field continued after transfer, but they were conducted by city contract workers. In June 2021, the New York City Department of Buildings issued an emergency order authorizing the demolition of eighteen buildings on the island, which the city deemed to be severely deteriorated. Sixteen of these buildings had been identified for demolition in a March 2020 report but, even then, some of these structures were also identified as being easy to repair. The New York City Department of Social Services awarded a $3.3 million contract to JPL Industries in October 2021 for the demolition of the deteriorated structures.

City officials announced in March 2023 that the island would be opened to the public at some point that year, and a touchstone memorial on the island was approved the same month. By that year, the city reported having razed and removed 15 of the island&#x27;s 19 structures. NYC Parks explained that its plans for the island are to create a safer environment for island visitors to visit the island&#x27;s cemeteries, but not to create a full-fledged public park.

==Cemetery==

Hart Island contains New York City&#x27;s potter&#x27;s field, or public cemetery (not to be confused with Potter&#x27;s Field in Brooklyn). The potter&#x27;s field is variously described as the largest tax-funded cemetery in the United States, the largest-such in the world, and one of the largest mass graves in the United States. At least 850,000 have been buried on the island, though since the 2000s, the burial rate has declined to fewer than 1,500 a year. According to a 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, there had been 1,419 burials at the potter&#x27;s field during the previous year: of these, 826 were adults, 546 were infants and stillborn babies, and 47 were dismembered body parts.

One-third of annual burials are infants and stillborn babies, which has been reduced from a proportion of one-half since the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program began to cover all pregnant women in New York State in 1997. By the 2020s, those buried on the island came from a wider range of economic and social classes. In 2022, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the island&#x27;s recent interments included &quot;a professional ballet dancer, a nurse, a software engineer, a scuba instructor and an acclaimed musical composer.&quot;

===Burials===
The dead are buried in trenches. Babies are placed in coffins, which are stacked in groups of 100, measuring five coffins deep and usually in twenty rows. Adults are placed in larger pine boxes placed according to size, and are stacked in sections of 150, measuring three coffins deep in two rows and laid out in a grid system. There are seven sizes of coffins, which range from long. Each box is labeled with an identification number, the person&#x27;s age, ethnicity, and the place where the body was found, if applicable. Prior to civilian contractors doing the actual burials which began in 2020, inmates from the nearby Rikers Island jail were paid fifty cents an hour to bury bodies on Hart Island.

The bodies of adults are frequently disinterred when families are able to locate their relatives through DNA, photographs and fingerprints kept on file at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York. There were an average of 72 disinterments per year from 2007 to 2009. As a result, the adults&#x27; coffins are staggered to expedite removal. Children, mostly infants, are rarely disinterred. Regulations stipulate that the coffins generally must remain untouched for 25 years, except in cases of disinterment.

Approximately half of the burials are of children under five who are identified and died in New York City&#x27;s hospitals, where the mothers signed papers authorizing a &quot;City Burial.&quot; The mothers were generally unaware of what the phrase meant. Many other interred have families who live abroad or out of state and whose relatives search extensively; these searches are made more difficult because burial records are currently kept within the prison system. An investigation into the handling of the infant burials was opened in response to a criminal complaint made to the New York State Attorney General&#x27;s Office in 2009.

Burial records on microfilm at the Municipal Archives indicate that until 1913, burials of unknowns were in single plots, and identified adults and children were buried in mass graves. In 1913, the trenches were separated to facilitate the more frequent disinterment of adults. Coffins are stacked three deep with 150 coffins assigned to each plot, and marked with GPS coordinates. The potter&#x27;s field is also used to dispose of amputated body parts, which are placed in boxes labeled &quot;limbs&quot;. Ceremonies have not been conducted at the burial site since the 1950s. In the past, burial trenches were re-used after 25–50 years, allowing for sufficient decomposition of the remains. Since then, however, historic buildings have been demolished to make room for new burials. A tall, white peace monument was erected by New York City prison inmates at the top of a hill that was known as &quot;Cemetery Hill&quot; following World War II and was dedicated in October 1948.

====Disease victims&#x27; burials====
Hart Island has also been used for burials of disease victims during epidemics and pandemics. During the 1980s AIDS epidemic, those who had died from AIDS were the only people to be buried in separate graves. At first, bodies were delivered in body bags and buried by inmate workers wearing protective jumpsuits. When it was later discovered that the corpses could not spread HIV, the city started burying people who had died of AIDS in the mass graves. In 2008, the island was selected as a site for mass burials during a particularly extreme flu pandemic, available for up to 20,000 bodies.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Hart Island was designated as the temporary burial site for people who had died from COVID-19 if deaths overwhelmed the capacity of mortuaries. At the time, deaths at home within the city had increased significantly, though the corpses were not tested for COVID-19. Preparations for mass graves began at the end of March 2020, and private contractors were hired to replace inmate labor for mass grave burials. Although several media sources reported in April 2020 that burials had begun, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio clarified that Hart Island was only being used to bury unclaimed corpses, as well as the bodies of those who chose it as a burial place. In 2021, the website &quot;The City&quot; published an analysis that found there was a sharp increase in the number of interments between 2019, when 846 corpses were buried on the island, and 2020, when 2,334 corpses were buried.

=== Records ===
Many burial records were destroyed by arson in late July 1977. Remaining records of burials before 1977 were transferred to the Municipal Archives in Manhattan; while records after that date are still kept in handwritten ledgers, these are now transcribed into a digital database that is partially available online. A Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request for 50,000 burial records was granted to the Hart Island Project in 2008. A lawsuit, concerning &quot;place of death&quot; information redacted from the Hart Island burial records, was filed against New York City&#x27;s government in July 2008 and was settled out of court in January 2009.

=== Notable people buried ===
Those interred on Hart Island are not necessarily homeless or indigent. Many of the dead either had families who could not afford the expenses of private funerals or were not claimed by relatives within a month of death. Notable burials include the playwright, film screenwriter, and director Leo Birinski, who was buried there in 1951 after dying alone and in poverty, and painter Mihri Müşfik Hanım, who was buried in 1954 after dying penniless. The American novelist Dawn Powell was buried on Hart Island in 1970, five years after her death, after her remains had been used for medical studies and the executor of her estate refused to reclaim them. Academy Award winner Bobby Driscoll, who was found dead in 1968 in an East Village tenement, was buried on Hart Island because his remains could not be identified in a timely fashion. T-Bone Slim, the labor activist, songwriter, and Wobbly, was buried on Hart Island after his body was found floating in the Hudson River. The composer Noah Creshevsky was interred on Hart Island at his own request because, according to his husband David Sachs, Creshevsky wanted to protest the trappings and cost of traditional funerals.

==Public engagement==
===Hart Island Project===

Founded by New York artist Melinda Hunt in 1994, the Hart Island Project is a nonprofit organization devoted to improving access to the island and its burial data. The organization helps families obtain copies of public burial records; arranges visits to grave sites; and operates a website to help people find relatives interred on the island. Historian Thomas Laqueur writes:

Since 2009, the city has given burial records for the island to the Hart Island Project. In turn, the organization maintains an online database of burial records from 1980 onward. The project has led to reforms of access to Hart Island such as opening the island monthly to everyone and legislation that requires the Department of Correction to publish burial records online.

The Hart Island Project has digitally mapped grave trenches using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. In 2014, an interactive map with GPS burial data and storytelling software, &quot;clocks of anonymity&quot; was released as the &quot;Traveling Cloud Museum&quot;, which collects publicly submitted stories of those who are listed in the burial records. Traveling Cloud Museum was updated in 2018 to include a map created with GeoTIFF images collected by a drone. The map displays nearly 69,000 intact burials and allows people who knew the deceased to add stories, photographs, epitaphs, songs and videos linked to a personal profile, as well as identify those who died of AIDS-related illnesses.

In 2012, Westchester Community College hosted an art exhibition of people whose graves were located through the Hart Island Project with Hunt&#x27;s help. The Hart Island Project also collaborated with British landscape architects Ann Sharrock and Ian Fisher to present a landscape strategy to the New York City Council and the Parks Department. Sharrock introduced the concept that Hart Island is a natural burial facility and outlined a growing interest in green burials in urban settings.

In 2023, the podcast Radio Diaries created an eight-episode series, &quot;The Unmarked Graveyard: Stories from Hart Island&quot;. The series tells the stories of people buried on the island, including the satirist writer and playwright Dawn Powell.

=== Legislation ===
On October 28, 2011, the New York City Council Committee on Fire and Criminal Justice held a hearing titled &quot;Oversight: Examining the Operation of Potter&#x27;s Field by the N.Y.C., Department of Correction on Hart Island&quot;. Legislation passed in 2013 requires the Department of Correction to make two sets of documents available on the Internet: a database of burials and a visitation policy. In April 2013, the Department of Correction published an online database of burials on the island. The database contains data about all persons buried on the island since 1977 and is composed of 66,000 entries.

==== Transfer to Parks Department ====
A bill to transfer jurisdiction to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation was introduced on April 30, 2012. The Hart Island Project testified in favor of this bill on September 27, 2012, but the bill was not passed.

The bill was reintroduced in March 2014, and Bill 0134 had a public hearing on January 20, 2016. The bill ultimately failed because neither the Parks Department nor the Department of Correction supported the move. The Parks Department stated that the operation of an active cemetery was outside its purview while the Department of Correction preferred that another city agency take control of Hart Island.

In 2018, City Council member Ydanis Rodríguez and three colleagues re-introduced the bill a second time. In supporting the bill, Rodriguez stated that he wanted relatives of Hart Island&#x27;s deceased to be able to access their loved ones&#x27; graves. The bill was passed in the New York City Council in November 2019, with most council members voting in favor of transferring jurisdiction to the Parks Department. The following month, mayor Bill de Blasio signed the legislation, as well as three other bills, including one that would allow the ferry service to be operated by the New York City Department of Transportation. NYC Parks finally assumed full control of the island in July 2021.

==Access==

The only access to Hart Island is by ferryboat. Hart Island and the pier on Fordham Street on City Island are restricted areas under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Correction. Family members who wish to visit the island must request a visit ahead of time with the Department of Correction. The city government allows family members to visit the island and leave mementos at grave sites, and maintains an online and telephone system for family members to schedule grave site visits. Other members of the public are permitted to visit by prior appointment only.

=== Ferry service ===
The city formerly operated a 24/7 ferry service between City and Hart islands, which ran every forty-five minutes during the day and less frequently at night. The ferries also transported corpses. By the 1960s, two ferryboats were used for the Hart Island ferry service; the &quot;Michael Cosgrove&quot; (built 1961) and the &quot;Fordham&quot; (in service 1922–1982). The service was extremely expensive to operate; in 1967, about 1,500 people per month used the service and the city spent $300,000 per year to keep it running. By 1977, the city had discontinued frequent ferry service and provided seven trips a day. The Department of Correction offered one guided tour of the island in 2000. Under legislation enacted in 2019, the New York City Department of Transportation was to operate the ferry at a higher frequency.

=== Loosening of restrictions ===
The process of visiting the island has been improved due to efforts by the Hart Island Project and the New York Civil Liberties Union. An ecumenical group named the Interfaith Friends of Potter&#x27;s Field and another organization called Picture the Homeless has also advocated for making the island more accessible. The Department of Correction opposed further loosening of restrictions on accessing Hart Island; a 2016 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article quoted a Corrections official as saying: &quot;As long as D.O.C. runs the facility, we are going to run it with the D.O.C. mentality&quot;.

In July 2015, the Department of Correction instituted a new policy, wherein up to five family members and their guests were allowed to visit grave sites on one weekend per month. The first visit took place on July 19, 2015. Visits to individual graves, which take place twice a month, are restricted to individuals who had a close relationship with the deceased. Monthly guided visits to Hart Island&#x27;s gazebo were available to the general public. The ferry leaves from a restricted dock on City Island. In 2017, the city government increased the maximum number of visitors per month from 50 to 70. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the public was not allowed to visit Hart Island; though visits resumed in May 2021, the number of visitors allowed on each ferry trip was decreased to ten.

=== NYC Parks control ===
In July 2021, responsibility for the island was finally fully transferred from the Department of Correction to NYC Parks. As part of the Hart Island Transportation Study, which sought to improve access to the island, NYC Parks conducted public meetings in early 2022. Four alternatives were presented: a shuttle bus service from Orchard Beach to the Fordham Street ferry pier; a shuttle bus service from the New York City Subway&#x27;s Pelham Bay Park station, stopping at Orchard Beach and Fordham Street; a new ferry service from Ferry Point Park to the island; and an extension of NYC Ferry&#x27;s Soundview route from Ferry Point Park to the island.

Even after NYC Parks took over the island, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported in October 2021 that there had been little change in the conditions for visitors. The New York City Parks Department has explained that its plans for the island are to create a safer environment for cemetery and island visitors, but not to create a full-fledged public park.

<text>Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is an antioxidant phytoestrogen present in flax, sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds. In food, it can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. It is a precursor of mammal lignans which are produced in the colon from chemicals in foods.

== Extraction ==
Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside can be isolated from de-fatted (hexane extraction) flaxseed by extraction of the lignan polymer precursor with a water/acetone mixture, followed by acetone removal and alkaline hydrolysis.

== Studies on biological effects ==

Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside slows the growth of human breast cancer in mice.

Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside may different roles in people. For example, due to 400-500Da size limit for Blood–Brain Barrier permeability, in one assessment of a Grade IV histology group of adult patients diagnosed with malignant glioma, high intake of secoisolariciresinol (for highest tertile compared to lowest tertile, in all cases) was associated with &quot;poorer&quot; survival.

In rabbits, SDG reduced hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis and this effect was associated with a decrease in serum cholesterol, LDL-C, and lipid peroxidation product and an increase in HDL-C and antioxidant reserve.

SDG has been shown to counter oxidative stress in human colonic epithelial tissue and protect against mtDNA damage &quot;in vitro&quot;, by H2O2 exposure, in a dose-dependent manner, and counters (in-vitro) oxidative stress on heart cells caused by Iron overload.

<text>Zeleia () was a town of the ancient Troad, at the foot of Mount Ida and on the banks of the river Aesepus (both located in Turkey), at a distance of 80 stadia from its mouth. It is mentioned by Homer in the Trojan Battle Order in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and later when Homer calls it a holy town. Zeleia led a force of warriors to aid Troy during the Trojan War, led by Pandarus, son of Lycaon (the latter Lycaon not to be confused with Lycaon, son of Priam. It is later related that the people of Zeleia are &quot;Lycians&quot;, though the Zeleians are distinct from the Lycians who come from Lycia in southwestern Asia Minor, led by Sarpedon and Glaucus. 

Arrian mentions it as the headquarters of the Persian army before the Battle of the Granicus, in May 334 BCE, where the Persian satraps held a council at Zeleia where they discussed how best to confront Alexander the Great. It existed in the time of Strabo; but afterwards it disappears. 

Arthmios (, Aryan-Luvian meaning &quot;truly mine&quot; or &quot;my perfect one&quot;) of Zeleia together with his family, was declared an outlaw in the territory of Athens and her allies, because he had brought the gold from Persian Empire into Peloponnese. 
Nicagoras () of Zeleia, was a tyrant of Zeleia.

The site of ancient Zeleia is located near Sarıköy, Balıkesir, Turkey.

<text>Namaste (, Devanagari: नमस्ते), sometimes called namaskār and namaskāram, is a customary Hindu manner of respectfully greeting and honouring a person or group, used at any time of day. It is used worldwide among the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain traditions. &quot;Namaste&quot; is usually spoken with a slight bow and hands pressed together, palms touching and fingers pointing upwards, thumbs close to the chest. This gesture is called añjali mudrā; the standing posture incorporating it is pranāmāsana.

== Etymology, meaning and origins ==
&quot;Namaste&quot; (&quot;Namas&quot; + &quot;te&quot;) is derived from Sanskrit and is a combination of the word &quot;namas&quot; and the second person dative pronoun in its enclitic form, &quot;te&quot;. The word &quot;namaḥ&quot; takes the sandhi form &quot;namas&quot; before the sound &quot;te&quot;.

It is found in the Vedic literature. &quot;Namas-krita&quot; and related terms appear in the Hindu scripture &quot;Rigveda&quot; such as in the &quot;Vivaha Sukta&quot;, verse 10.85.22 in the sense of &quot;worship, adore&quot;, while &quot;Namaskara&quot; appears in the sense of &quot;exclamatory adoration, homage, salutation and worship&quot; in the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, the &quot;Taittiriya Samhita&quot;, and the &quot;Aitareya Brahmana&quot;. It is an expression of veneration, worship, reverence, an &quot;offering of homage&quot; and &quot;adoration&quot; in the Vedic literature and post-Vedic texts such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The phrase &quot;Namas-te&quot; appears with this meaning in &quot;Rigveda&quot; 8.75.10, &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; verse 6.13.2, &quot;Taittirya Samhita&quot; 2.6.11.2 and in numerous other instances in many early Hindu texts. It is also found in numerous ancient and medieval era sculpture and &quot;mandapa&quot; relief artwork in Hindu temples.

According to the Indologist Stephen Phillips, the terms &quot;&quot;te&quot; and &quot;tvam&quot;&quot; are an informal, familiar form of &quot;you&quot; in Sanskrit, and it is typically not used for unfamiliar adults. It is reserved for someone familiar, intimate, divine or a child. By using the dative form of &quot;tvam&quot; in the greeting &quot;Namas-te&quot;, there is an embedded secondary, metaphorical sense in the word. This is the basis of the pragmatic meaning of &quot;Namas-te&quot;, that is &quot;salutations to the (divine) child (in your heart)&quot;, states Phillips.

In the contemporary era, &quot;namaḥ&quot; means &#x27;bow&#x27;, &#x27;obeisance&#x27;, &#x27;reverential salutation&#x27; or &#x27;adoration&#x27; and &quot;te&quot; means &#x27;to you&#x27; (singular dative case of &#x27;tvam&#x27;). Therefore, &quot;namaste&quot; literally means &quot;bowing to you&quot;. In Hinduism, it also has a spiritual import reflecting the belief that &quot;the divine and self (atman, Self) is same in you and me&quot;, and connotes &quot;I bow to the divine in you&quot;. According to sociologist Holly Oxhandler, it is a Hindu term which means &quot;the sacred in me recognizes the sacred in you&quot;.

A less common variant is used in the case of three or more people being addressed namely &quot;Namo vaḥ&quot; which is a combination of &quot;namaḥ&quot; and the enclitic second person plural pronoun &quot;vaḥ&quot;. The word &quot;namaḥ&quot; takes the sandhi form &quot;namo&quot; before the sound &quot;v&quot;. An even less common variant is used in the case of two people being addressed, namely, &quot;Namo vām&quot;, which is a combination of &quot;namaḥ&quot; and the enclitic second person dual pronoun &quot;vām&quot;.

===History===
Excavations at various Indus Valley Civilisation have revealed some male and female terracotta figures in &quot;namaste&quot; posture. These archaeological findings are dated to the Mature Harappan.

==Anjali Mudra==
The gesture of folding hands during a namaste is called the &quot;Añjali Mudrā&quot;. In addition to &quot;namaste&quot;, this &quot;mudra&quot; is one of the postures found in Indian classical dance such as Bharatanatyam, and in yoga practice. It is widely found in Indian temple reliefs and sculpture in mandapam, at entrances and iconography such as the Lingobhavamurti of Shaivism. The Anjali mudra differs from namaste by being a non-verbal gesture, while namaste can be said with or without any gesture. According to Bhaumik and Govil, the Anjali mudra and Namaskara mudra are very similar but have a subtle difference. The back of the thumbs in Anjali mudra face the chest and are perpendicular to other fingers, while the thumbs in Namaskara mudra are aligned with the other fingers.

Anjali mudra is described in Sanskrit texts such as in verse 9.127–128 of the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (200 BCE – 200 CE), in temple architecture texts dated after the sixth-century CE such as in verse 5.67 of the &quot;Devata murti prakarana&quot; and those on painting called the &quot;Citrasutras&quot;. The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, a classical Indian dance text, describes it to be a posture where the two hands are folded together in a reverential state and that this is used to pray before a deity, receive any person one reveres and also to greet friends. The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; further states that for prayers inside a temple, the Anjali mudra should be placed near one&#x27;s head or above, while meeting someone venerable it is placed in front of one&#x27;s face or chin, and for friends near one&#x27;s chest.

==Uses==
The gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of Asia and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated. &quot;Namaste&quot; is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger. In some contexts, &quot;namaste&quot; is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.

&quot;Namaskara&quot; is one of the 16 &quot;upacharas&quot; (veneration practices) used inside temples or any place of formal puja (worship). &quot;Namaste&quot; in the context of deity worship, scholars conclude, has the same function as in greeting a guest or anyone else. It expresses politeness, courtesy, honor, and hospitality from one person to the other. It is used in goodbyes as well. This is sometimes expressed, in ancient Hindu scriptures such as Taittiriya Upanishad, as Atithi Devo Bhava (literally, treat the guest like a god).

&quot;Namaste&quot; is one of the six forms of pranama, and in parts of India these terms are used synonymously.

Since namaste is a non-contact form of greeting, some world leaders adopted the gesture as an alternative to hand shaking during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic as a means to prevent the spread of the virus.

<text>The AM transmitter in Burg, near Magdeburg, Germany, is a huge facility for longwave and mediumwave broadcasting. Its most dominant constructions are a 324-metre guyed radio mast and two 210 metre guyed steel tube masts.

The 324-metre-high mast is a grounded construction with triangular cross section. Until the early 1990s it had a highly effective fading-reducing transmitting antenna in the form of a special cage aerial developed in Russia, known as the ARRT-antenna. It was used for the 1000 kW-medium wave transmitter operated on 783 kHz, which was the strongest transmitter of the former GDR, as transmitting antenna. Today this mast has a cage aerial for long wave. Both the 210-metre-high tube masts are isolated from the ground. One of the two tube masts can be used as a toe-fed mast antenna for long and medium wave, while the other mast can be used only as a transmitting antenna for the medium-wave band.

As further antenna systems there are still three step-radiating antennas, each of which is supported by two freestanding steel framework towers and which served as transmitting antenna for a medium-wave transmitter on the frequency 1575 kHz (shut down at present) and a triangle plane aerial for medium wave.

From 1967 to 1976 there was also another radio mast for long wave, the steel tube lattice mast SL3, which was used for transmitting the program of Radio Wolga. In order not to affect the radiation field of the other masts, this radio mast was placed at a distance of 2.2 kilometres from the other masts near the road from Burg to Grabow, in the neighbourhood of Gütter, part of Burg. It collapsed on February 18, 1976, because of a defective bolt and was not rebuilt. As a replacement, one of the two steel tube masts was converted in such a way that it could also broadcast the program of Radio Wolga (and later also of Radioropa Info) in the long-wave range. There are still some remains of the basements of the radio mast SL3 today.

In the 1960s some propaganda transmitters, as German military transmitters, were operated on the site of the AM transmitter Burg.

<doc id="1249591" wikidata="Q452815" url="?curid=1249591" title="Raymond Goethals">
<text>Raymond Goethals (, ; 7 October 1921 – 6 December 2004) was a Belgian football coach who led Marseille to victory in the UEFA Champions League final in 1993, becoming the first coach to win a European trophy with a French club and also the only coach to win the Champions League with a French club.

Sometimes nicknamed &quot;Raymond-la-science&quot; (&quot;Raymond-the-Science&quot;, previously the nickname of Belgian anarchist and Bonnot gang member Raymond Callemin), &quot;le sorcier&quot; (&quot;the Wizard&quot;) or &quot;le magicien&quot; (&quot;the Magician&quot;), Goethals was known for his blunt way of speaking, his habit of mispronouncing players&#x27; names and his distinctive Brussels accent. A chain smoker, he was likened to TV police detective Lieutenant Columbo. He was the father of the referee Guy Goethals, who officiated at the 1992 European Championship and 1996 European Championship.

==Playing career==
Goethals began his career as a goalkeeper in the 1930s with Daring Brussels, making his way through the youth ranks of the club before joining Racing Club Brussel in 1947. He remained at Racing Club Brussel until 1948.

==Coaching career==

===Early career===
After a period spent playing for Renaisiènne, he moved into coaching with Hannutois and Waremme, and led Sint-Truiden to second place in the Belgian First Division in 1966.

===Belgium national team===
Goethals took charge of the Belgium national team in 1968. Belgium succeeded in qualifying for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, although they were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. Belgium hosted the 1972 European Championship, having knocked out holders Italy in the qualifying stages, and defeated Hungary in the match for third place after losing in the semi-final to eventual tournament winners Germany. That marked Goethals&#x27; greatest success as national team coach. He also took great pride in the fact that Belgium had held the emergent Netherlands scoreless in both their meetings in 1974 World Cup qualifying. Belgium completed their qualifying campaign without having conceded a single goal, but lost out to the Netherlands on account of their inferior goal difference.

===Return to club coaching===
In 1976 Goethals&#x27; tenure as coach of the national side ended, and he joined Anderlecht as coach. In his first season, Anderlecht reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they lost to German side Hamburger SV, but won the trophy the following year with a comprehensive victory over FK Austria/WAC. After spells coaching in France at Bordeaux and in Brazil with São Paulo, Goethals returned to Belgium to coach Standard Liège. Standard Liège were Belgian champions in 1982 and 1983, and they reached the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final in 1982, losing to Barcelona, who were at a considerable advantage in that the final was played at their home ground, Camp Nou.

===Controversy and Goethals&#x27; return to Anderlecht===
Standard Liège&#x27;s 1982 championship win was to become the subject of great controversy in 1984. Seemingly preoccupied with winning his first Belgian title, Goethals had suggested and initiated the bribing of the Waterschei players prior to the teams&#x27; meeting in the final match of the season, in order to secure championship honours for Standard Liège and ensure that none of his players would miss their European final against Barcelona through injury. Goethals was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal, and he moved to Portugal to take charge of Vitória Guimarães. He then returned to Belgium to coach Racing Jet de Bruxelles before a second spell in charge of Anderlecht, where he won Belgian Cup trophy in 1989. Bordeaux again recruited Goethals, and they finished runners-up in the French championship in 1989–90 behind Marseille. Approaching 70 years of age, Goethals&#x27; greatest triumph as a coach was yet to come.

===Marseille===
In 1990, Goethals was named coach of Olympique de Marseille and was entrusted with the task of leading the club to European Cup success. In his first season, the club narrowly missed out on European glory, losing on penalties in the European Cup Final to Red Star Belgrade. There was recognition for Goethals&#x27; coaching abilities, as he was voted 1991 European Coach of the Year. In 1993, Marseille again reached the European Cup final, where they defeated favourites A.C. Milan with a headed goal by Basile Boli. Having achieved his primary objective at Marseille, Goethals left the club.

Marseille were later stripped of their 1993 French championship when it emerged that three Valenciennes players had been offered money to underperform in a crucial match against Marseille. The club were not allowed to defend their European title as a result, and were punished with relegation to the French second division.

==Retirement==
Goethals&#x27; coaching career ended at Anderlecht in season 1995–96, but he remained in demand as a television analyst for his insights into football. He died on 6 December 2004 of bowel cancer aged 83. In 2005, the year following his death, he was voted 38th in De Grootste Belg, a Flemish television programme based on the BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Britons. The number 2 stand at F.C. Brussels&#x27; home ground, Edmond Machtens Stadium, was renamed in honour of Goethals in late 2005. He remains today as the oldest winning manager of UEFA Champions League.

<text>Ammerzoden is a village on the northern bank of the Maas river in western Gelderland, a Dutch province. The people of the village have strong connections with the people in the province of North Brabant, especially the nearby city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. Since 1 January 1999, Ammerzoden has been part of the municipality of Maasdriel.

Ammerzoden has a famous castle, &#x27;Kasteel Ammersoyen&#x27;, built around 1300. It was heavily damaged by fire in 1590, and sustained damage during World War II. The castle was reopened in 1975.

Ammerzoden has two churches. The Protestant church, built between 1500 and 1547 as a Catholic church, was partly destroyed by the French in 1672. Some years before, the church became the property of the Protestants. Even today, most of the building is a ruin. Some parts are restored and in use.

In the nineteenth century, the Catholic people built a new church for themselves, named after St. Willibrord. This building was destroyed by the Germans in World War II. A new church with the same name has existed since 1953.

Until 1999, Ammerzoden was a separate municipality

==Statistics==
In 2001, the town of Ammerzoden had 2849 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.69 km2, and contained 1034 residences.
The statistical area &quot;Ammerzoden&quot;, which also can include the peripheral parts of the village, as well as the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 3180.

<text>The Peabody Essex Museum (PEM) in Salem, Massachusetts, US, is a successor to the East India Marine Society, established in 1799. It combines the collections of the former Peabody Museum of Salem (which acquired the Society&#x27;s collection) and the Essex Institute. PEM is one of the oldest continuously operating museums in the United States and holds one of the major collections of Asian art in the United States. Its total holdings include about 1.3 million pieces, as well as twenty-two historic buildings.

After opening newly expanded spaces in 2019, PEM now ranks in the top 10 North American art museums in terms of gallery square footage, operating budget and endowment. The PEM holds more than 840,000 works of historical and cultural art covering maritime, American, Asian, Oceanic and African art, Asian export art, and two large libraries with over 400,000 books and manuscripts.

==History==
In 1992, the Peabody Museum of Salem merged with the Essex Institute to form the Peabody Essex Museum. Included in the merger was the legacy of the East India Marine Society, established in 1799 by a group of Salem-based captains and supercargoes. Members of the Society were required by the society&#x27;s charter to collect &quot;natural and artificial curiosities&quot; from beyond the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn. They were also required to personally circumnavigate the globe, and share navigational discoveries with other Society members, thereby increasing their chances of returning from their voyages safely. Due to the institution&#x27;s age, the items they donated to the collections are significant for their rare combination of age and provenance.

The East India Marine Society built East India Marine Hall, a National Historic Landmark now embedded in the museum&#x27;s facilities, in the 1820s to house its collection. This collection was acquired by the Peabody Academy of Science (later renamed the Peabody Museum of Salem) in 1867, along with the building, which continued to serve as a museum space through these mergers and acquisitions.





===21st century===
In 2003, the Peabody Essex Museum completed a massive $100 million renovation and expansion resulting in the opening of a new wing designed by Moshe Safdie. This more than doubled the gallery space to 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2), which allowed the display of many items from its extensive holdings, previously unknown to the public due to lack of exhibition space. At this time, the museum also opened to the public the Yin Yu Tang House, an early 19th-century Chinese house from Anhui Province that had been disassembled in its original village and reconstructed on the museum grounds.

In 2011, the Peabody Essex Museum announced it had raised $550 million, with plans to raise an additional $100 million by 2016. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported this was the largest capital campaign in the museum&#x27;s history, vaulting the Peabody Essex into the top tier of major art museums. The PEM trustee co-chairs Sam Byrne and Sean Healey with board president Robert Shapiro led the campaign.$200 to $250 million will fund the museum&#x27;s expansion bringing the total square footage to .

In May 2012, the PEM confirmed that its expansion would not be finished until 2019, due to the unexpected death of museum architect Rick Mather in April 2012 and the search for his replacement. The firm of Ennead Architects (New York) was chosen after successfully completing the first phase of the building project, which included master planning and the renovation of the museum&#x27;s Dodge wing, which was scheduled to open in November 2013.

On September 28, 2019, the museum opened a new wing designed by Ennead Architects, adjacent to East India Marine Hall. This addition included of Class A galleries as well as a landscaped garden designed by Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects.

==Leadership==
In 2021, Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, PEM&#x27;s former deputy director and Chief Curator, became the first woman to be the Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo Director and CEO of PEM.

The director and CEO from 1993 to 2019 was Dan Monroe. He was succeeded on July 15, 2019, by Brian Kennedy, who previously directed the Toledo Museum of Art.

==Collections==
===African art===
The Peabody Essex Museum&#x27;s collection of African art includes approximately 3,600 objects as of 2014. The acquisition of these works began in the early 19th century, as members of the East India Marine Society collected objects from West and sub-Saharan Africa. These objects include ceremonial masks, pottery, woven baskets, and a significant collection of Ethiopian art—particularly Christian icons and metalwork, many of which are based in the traditions of Byzantine art. In 1812, Salem became the headquarters of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which went on to establish missions throughout the continent. These missions facilitated trade, particularly with the Zulu in South Africa, and contributed significantly to the growth of the collection.

===American art===
PEM&#x27;s extensive collection of American art includes over 1,000 portraits, among them works by John Singer Sargent, Fitz Henry Lane, and James Bard. Furniture, folk art, and needlework are also prominent features of the collection. The museum&#x27;s New England heritage has brought it an especially large array of decorative arts from the Northeastern United States. Many of these objects were initially collected by the Essex Institute, which was dedicated to preserving the cultural and physical history of Essex County.

===Chinese art===
The museum&#x27;s collection of Chinese art, which includes over 6,000 objects, features contemporary and ancient works as well as works by minority nationalities within China. Ceramics, textiles, and calligraphy form the bulk of the collection, which began in the 18th century with exports acquired by New England traders. Even before the founding of the East India Marine Society, missionaries such as Reverend William Bentley were collecting sculptures, fans, and other pieces that would form the foundation of the museum&#x27;s collection. The largest piece at the museum is the Yin Yu Tang House, a late 18th century home from the Anhui province of China. This house, constructed during the Qing dynasty, was acquired by Nancy Berliner, at the time PEM&#x27;s curator of Chinese art and culture, before being taken apart and reassembled in Salem.

===Fashion and textiles===
Among the most important in the United States, the museum&#x27;s American clothing collection, with examples dating from the early 18th century to the present, represents many of New England&#x27;s prominent families, including Salem&#x27;s Crowninshields, who helped establish the city as a seafaring hub. Among its areas of strength are military uniforms, a collection established by the Essex Institute following the end of the American Civil War in 1865, and significant holdings representing the work of notable designers, dressmakers and milliners, including Alexander McQueen, Rei Kawakubo, Jamie Okuma, and hundreds of pieces from legendary fashion icon, Iris Apfel.

===Indian art===
The Peabody Essex Museum&#x27;s collection of Indian art includes over 5,000 objects. It also possesses numerous works of Tibetan and Nepalese origins, along with perhaps the most important collection of contemporary Indian art outside of India. PEM&#x27;s Herwitz Gallery, opened in 2003 and named to honor art collectors Chester and Davida Herwitz, is the first American museum gallery dedicated to modern Indian art. PEM&#x27;s collection spans a wide array of eras and mediums, forming a detailed record of India&#x27;s artistic transformations during colonial rule and its aftermath. As PEM&#x27;s ex-curator of South Asia and Korean Art Susan S. Bean observed, &quot;the global development of industrial production brought machine-woven textiles, printed images, and photography into competition with handlooms, sculpture, and painting&quot;, all of which are art forms well represented throughout PEM&#x27;s collection.

===Japanese art===
Featuring approximately 18,300 objects, PEM&#x27;s collection of Japanese art began with the museum&#x27;s inception in 1799. Its collections of work from the Edo period and Meiji period are particularly robust, featuring armor, sculpture, painted scrolls, furniture, and more. Much of the collection has its origins in the travels of Edward S. Morse, the third director of the museum, who acquired many pieces over the course of three trips to Japan. Morse also helped raise interest in Japanese art in Massachusetts and New England: as Midori Oka states, Morse was &quot;instrumental in influencing the area intellectuals and connoisseurs to turn their interests to Japanese art&quot;.

===Korean art===
The Peabody Essex Museum has approximately 1,800 pieces of Korean art in its collection, including ceramics, textiles, and painted screens. The collection began in 1883, as the result of a collaboration between museum director Edward Sylvester Morse and Korean scholar Yu Kil-chun, who was a member of the first official Korean delegation to the United States. Much of the collection consists of art of the Joseon dynasty, which occupied the transitional period between the traditional Korean empire and modernity. Many of the pieces in the collection, particularly those from the Joseon period, display the centrality of art in the habits, rituals, and ceremonies of everyday Korean life. As former PEM curator Susan S. Bean observes, art objects were &quot;essential to the conduct of social life because they conveyed values, fulfilled wishes, provided access to deities and ancestors, taught lessons and conferred prestige&quot;.

===Maritime art===
By the end of the 18th century, coinciding with the museum&#x27;s 1799 founding, Salem was one of the nation&#x27;s most prosperous seaports, and extensive trading of furs, spices, dyes, and other goods brought much wealth to the region. This long legacy of trade contributed greatly to the foundation and growth of PEM&#x27;s maritime art collection, which is among the finest of its kind in the country. The collection includes over 50,000 objects, including paintings, model ships, scrimshaw, and more. Many diverse styles and periods of maritime art are on display in the collection, from navigational tools such as sextants to modern marine art, which addresses &quot;nostalgic themes&quot; and represents &quot;the seafaring life of previous times&quot;. One significant feature of the currently installed collection is a recreation of a room in Cleopatra&#x27;s Barge, an opulent yacht which was built by Salem&#x27;s Crowninshield family and eventually became the royal yacht of King Kamehameha II.

===Native American art===
PEM&#x27;s collection of Native American art includes over 20,000 objects, spanning a wide variety of tribal affiliations and time periods. The collection includes masks, textiles, jewelry, clothing, sculpture, and more, along with many pieces by contemporary Native American artists such as Frank Day and Kay WalkingStick. The origins of PEM&#x27;s collection can be traced to even before the museum&#x27;s 1799 founding: the maritime fur trade, as well as the trading of iron to local tribes, made the exchange of art objects a frequent occurrence. As Richard Conn writes, &quot;in some cases, objects of considerable importance were given by their native owners as gifts to their European trading partners. The intent here was probably to enhance the trading relationship and to insure that the Yankee or British ship would return next year with more iron.&quot;

===Oceanic art===
Featuring objects from over 36 different groups of islands in Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia, the Peabody Essex Museum&#x27;s collection of Oceanic art contains over 15,000 objects in total. These objects, consisting of sculptures, weapons, clothing, and more, include pieces made from traditional Oceanic materials such as porpoise teeth, abalone, and human hair. Also worth noting is the museum&#x27;s particularly substantial collection of Hawaiian art, which includes over 5,000 objects. While Salem had little direct trade with Hawaii during the 18th and 19th centuries, regional trade and donations from prominent sea captains led to the acquisition of many significant pieces, including some associated with Kamehameha I and James Cook.

===Photography===
PEM&#x27;s collection of photography is its largest single collection by number of objects, featuring over 850,000 images. The collection began in 1840, just one year after the invention of photography. It includes work by pioneering photographers such as William Henry Fox Talbot and Antoine Claudet. It also features a collection of rare Civil War photographs by Matthew Brady, one of the first American photographers. The collection has a vast variety of subjects and styles, from records of native life in the Philippines to photographs by Walker Evans which document the Great Depression.

===Library===
The museum has extensive collections of rare books, manuscripts, and ephemera in the Phillips Library. On December 8, 2017, Dan L. Monroe, PEM&#x27;s director and CEO, issued a press release announcing that of historical documents would be permanently relocated to Rowley, Massachusetts; Plummer Hall and Daland House, the two historic buildings which had housed the Phillips Library, would be utilized as office and meeting space.

=== Architecture in the collection ===
The museum owns 24 historic structures and gardens, some of which are concentrated in the old Essex Institute grounds which now form the Essex Institute Historic District. Five of these buildings are National Historic Landmarks and eight others are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some are shown in the gallery below. The full set of buildings are: Daniel Bray House, Gilbert Chadwick House, Cotting-Smith Assembly House, Crowninshield-Bentley House, John Tucker Daland House, Derby-Beebe Summer House, East India Marine Hall (integrated into the main museum), Gardner-Pingree House and Gardner-Pingree Carriage House, Lyle-Tapley Shoe Shop, Dodge Wing of the Peabody Essex Museum, Asian Export Art Wing of the Peabody Essex Museum, Peirce-Nichols House, Samuel Pickman House, Plummer Hall, Quaker Meeting House, L. H. Rogers Building, Ropes Mansion, Andrew Safford House, Summer School Building, Vilate Young (Kinsman) House, and John Ward House. Some of these properties are open to guided tours.

<doc id="1249598" wikidata="Q3393063" url="?curid=1249598" title="Mlaḥsô language">
<text>Mlaḥsô or Mlahsö (), sometimes referred to as Suryoyo or Surayt, is an extinct or dormant Central Neo-Aramaic language. It was traditionally spoken in eastern Turkey and later also in northeastern Syria by Syriac Orthodox Christians.

The Mlaḥsô language (Surayt of Mlaḥsô) is closely related to the Surayt of Turabdin but sufficiently different to be considered a separate language, with the syntax of the language having retained more features of Classical Syriac than Turoyo. It was spoken in the villages of Mlaḥsô (, ), a village established by two monks from the Tur Abdin mountain range, and in the village of ˁAnşa near Lice, Diyarbakır, Turkey.

==Etymology==
The name of the village and the language is derived from the earlier Aramaic word &quot;mālaḥtā&quot;, &#x27;salt marsh&#x27;. The literary Syriac name for the language is &quot;Mlaḥthoyo&quot;. The native speakers of Mlaḥsô referred to their language simply as &quot;Suryô&quot;, or Syriac.

==History and distribution==
The language was still spoken by a handful of people in the 1970s. The last fluent native speaker of Mlaḥsô, Ibrahim Ḥanna, died in 1999 in Qamishli. His daughters, Munira in Qamishli, Shamiram in Lebanon, and son Dr. Isḥaq Ibrahim in Germany are the only speakers left with some limited native proficiency of the language. Recordings of Ibrahim Ḥanna speaking the language are available on Heidelberg University&#x27;s Semitic Sound Archive which were done by Otto Jastrow, a prominent German semiticist who is credited as the modern &quot;discoverer&quot; of the language and published the first modern research papers on the existence of Mlaḥsô and its linguistic features.

On 3 May 2009, a historical event in the history of the Mlaḥsô Surayt language took place. The Suroyo TV television station aired the program series &quot;Dore w yawmotho&quot;, which was about the village Mlaḥsô (and the Tur Abdin village Tamarze). Dr. Isḥaq Ibrahim, the son of Ibrahim Ḥanna, was a guest and spoke in the Mlaḥsô language with his sisters Shamiram in Lebanon and Munira in Qamishli live on the phone. Otto Jastrow was also interviewed regarding his expertise on Mlaḥsô. Assyrians from Tur Abdin and those present at the show were able to hear the language spoken live for the first time at the event.

The extinction of Mlaḥsô can be attributed to the small amount of original speakers of the language, and them being limited to two isolated villages, resulting in a disproportionate loss of speakers during the Assyrian genocide compared to Turoyo and other variants of Neo-Aramaic.

==Phonology==
Mlahsô is phonologically less conservative than Turoyo. This is particularly noticeable in the use of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; for classical &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;ð&quot;. The classical &quot;v&quot; has been retained though, while it has collapsed into &quot;w&quot; in Turoyo. Also sometimes &quot;y&quot; (IPA /j/) replaces &quot;ġ&quot;. Mlaḥsô also renders the combination of vowel plus &quot;y&quot; as a single, fronted vowel rather than a diphthong or a glide.

=== Consonants ===

=== Vowels ===
Mlahsô has the following set of vowels:
* Close front unrounded vowel – 
* Close-mid front unrounded vowel – 
* Open front unrounded vowel – 
* Open back rounded vowel – 
* Close back rounded vowel – 

== Morphology ==
Mlaḥsô is more conservative than Turoyo in grammar and vocabulary, using classical Syriac words and constructions while also preserving the original Aramaic form.

<doc id="1249599" wikidata="Q3570325" url="?curid=1249599" title="X11vnc">
<text>x11vnc is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server program. It allows remote access from a remote client to a computer hosting an X Window session and the x11vnc software, continuously polling the X server&#x27;s frame buffer for changes. This allows the user to control their X11 desktop (KDE, GNOME, Xfce, etc.) from a remote computer either on the user&#x27;s own network, or from over the Internet as if the user were sitting in front of it. x11vnc can also poll non-X11 frame buffer devices, such as webcams or TV tuner cards, iPAQ, Neuros OSD, the Linux console, and the Mac OS X graphics display.
x11vnc is part of the LibVNCServer project and is free software available under the GNU General Public License.
x11vnc was written by Karl Runge.

x11vnc does not create an extra display (or X desktop) for remote control. Instead, it uses the existing X11 display shown on the monitor of a Unix-like computer in real time, unlike other Linux alternatives such as TightVNC Server. However, it is possible to use Xvnc or Xvfb to create a &#x27;virtual&#x27; extra display, and have x11vnc connect to it, enabling X-11 access to headless servers.

x11vnc has security features that allows the user to set an access password or to use Unix usernames and passwords. It also has options for connection via a secure SSL link. An SSL Java VNC viewer applet is provided that enables secure connections from a web browser. The VeNCrypt SSL/TLS VNC security type is also supported.

Many of the UltraVNC extensions to VNC are supported by x11vnc, including file transfer.

== Polling algorithm ==

x11vnc keeps a copy of the X server&#x27;s frame buffer in RAM. The X11 programming interface codice_1 is used to retrieve the frame buffer pixel data. x11vnc compares the X server&#x27;s frame buffer against its copy to see which pixel regions have changed (and hence need to be sent to the VNC viewers.) Reading pixel data from the physical frame buffer can be much slower than writing to it (because graphics devices are not optimized for reading) and so a sequential pixel by pixel check would often be too slow.

To improve the situation, x11vnc reads in full rows of pixels separated by 32 pixels vertically. Once it gets to the bottom of the screen it starts again near the top with a slightly different offset. After 32 passes like this it has covered the entire screen. This method enables x11vnc to detect changes on the screen roughly 32 times more quickly than a sequential check would (unless the changes are very small, say only 1 pixel tall.) If the X11 DAMAGE extension is present, x11vnc uses it to provide hints where to focus its polling, thereby finding changes even more quickly and also lowering the system load.

== Input injection ==

When x11vnc receives user input events (keystrokes, pointer motion, and pointer button clicks) from a VNC viewer, it must inject them synthetically into the X server. The X11 programming interfaces codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4 of the XTEST extension are used to achieve this.

For non-X11 managed devices (such as the Mac OS X graphics display) different programming interfaces must be used. x11vnc also provides an interface where the user can supply their own input injection program.

== Interesting uses ==

Often special-purpose systems are built using the X Window System to manage the graphical display. x11vnc can be used to export the system&#x27;s display for remote VNC access. This enables remote monitoring, control, and troubleshooting of the special-purpose system. Sometimes this saves sending a technician to a remote site or allows users to control equipment from their workstation or laptop. x11vnc is known to have been run on the following types of systems: Electron microscope, MRI and Radiology image analysis system, Power plant and Oil platform management consoles, Materials distribution control, Ship self-defense system testing, NMR systems, Silicon wafer analysis microscope, and Theater and concert lighting control. x11vnc is used to export the X11 displays in embedded systems such as Linux-based PDAs and Home theater PCs.

If x11vnc cannot be run on the special-purpose system, sometimes it can be run on a nearby computer and poll the X server frame buffer over the network. This is how proprietary X terminal devices can be accessed via x11vnc.

== Xvnc emulation ==

Although x11vnc&#x27;s primary use is for X servers associated with physical graphics hardware, it can also attach to virtual X servers (whose frame buffers exist in RAM only) such as Xvfb or a Sun Ray session. x11vnc has options (codice_5 and codice_6) to start Xvfb automatically, possibly as the Unix user that logged in. The interactive response of x11vnc and Xvfb may not be as fast as Xvnc, however this mode enables features that Xvnc does not have, such as SSL encryption and Unix usernames and passwords.

== Client-side caching ==

The RFB (VNC) protocol is odd when compared to other network graphics protocols, such as X11 and RDP, in that there is no provision for viewer-side caching of pixel data. While this makes the client easier to implement, there is a price to pay in terms of interactive response. For example, every re-exposure of a window or background region needs to have its (compressed) pixel data resent over the network. This effect is particularly noticeable for windows with complex or photo regions (such as a web browser window) that gets iconified and deiconified or re-exposed often.

x11vnc has an experimental and somewhat brute-force implementation of client-side caching. It is enabled via the codice_7 option. When creating the RFB frame buffer in this mode, x11vnc allocates a very large scratch region below the top portion used for the actual (on-screen) pixel data. x11vnc can then use the RFB CopyRect command to instruct the viewer to move rectangles of pixel data into and out of the scratch region. These moves are done locally on the viewer side. In this way x11vnc can manage the scratch region to store and retrieve pixel data without having to resend it over the network.

x11vnc&#x27;s client-side caching mode can give noticeable interactive response improvements for many activities. Since it uses the existing RFB CopyRect command, the scheme will work with any (i.e. unmodified) VNC viewer. There are some disadvantages, however. The first is that it consumes a large amount of memory. For good performance a scratch region 10 to 20 times larger than the actual screen should be used. So instead of using 5 MB for a 1280x1024 truecolor frame buffer, closer to 100 MB will be used (on both the VNC client and server sides). This is not so much of an issue on modern computers, but would not be possible on a low memory device. Second, the VNC viewer may treat the scratch region in ways that confuse the user, for example displaying it to the user or automatically panning down into it if the mouse reaches the bottom of the real screen. The Unix VNC viewer in SSVNC automatically hides the scratch region. Finally, x11vnc&#x27;s heuristics for caching and reusing window pixel data are not perfect and can lead to unexpected flashing of a window&#x27;s contents and other undesired effects.

<doc id="1249602" wikidata="Q5496942" url="?curid=1249602" title="Freddy the Pig">
<text>Freddy the Pig is the central figure in a series of 26 children&#x27;s books written between 1927 and 1958 by American author Walter R. Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese, consisting of 25 novels and one poetry collection. The books focus on the adventures of a group of animals living on a farm in rural upstate New York. 
Freddy is introduced as &quot;the smallest and cleverest&quot; of the pigs on the Bean farm. He is initially just one of the ensemble, but he becomes the central character shortly into the series. Freddy&#x27;s interests drive the books as he becomes a detective, politician, newspaper editor, magician, pilot, and other vocations or avocations. A recurring villain is the slimy but dignified Simon, who leads a gang of criminal rats. Human characters include Mr. and Mrs. Bean (who own the farm), the population of local Centerboro, and human villains.

Much of the humor in the books is derived from the self-referential way in which the author acknowledges the unreality of talking animals, unlike other children&#x27;s works in which they are accepted as normal. As the series progresses, the Bean Farm animals attain national fame for their ability to talk and read, and the humans whom they encounter are taken aback at first (though only momentarily) to find themselves conversing with animals. The stories reflect the social conditions at the time of writing; for example, the books published during World War II feature scrap drives and victory gardens.

==History==

Brooks created his animals for &quot;To and Again&quot;, published in 1927 by Alfred A. Knopf. It took some time before their personalities were fully developed, along with their ability to talk to humans when they chose, beginning with the fourth volume in 1936. In the remainder of the series, the animals of the Bean Farm lead a highly developed life, variously operating a bank, a newspaper, the First Animal Republic, and Freddy&#x27;s detective business, which follows the principles of Sherlock Holmes as Freddy knows them from his reading.

The books went out of print in the 1960s, despite their popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, but children&#x27;s libraries continued to have them. At the turn of the millennium, the entire series was republished by The Overlook Press in response to plaintive requests from Freddy fans who treasure their combination of ingenious plots, well-drawn characters, literary allusions, and wholesome (but not cloying) moral lessons. In 2024 the first Freddy title, &quot;To and Again&quot;, entered the public domain and was reprinted by the Friends of Freddy, Inc., a 501c3 literary organization of Freddy fans. The new edition features original color illustrations by graphic artist and writer Eric Shanower, and an introduction by book reviewer Michael Cart.

The audio and film rights to the series have been sold. Audio versions of some books were made and, as of 2009, others are apparently in preparation.

==Reception of books==
Adam Hochschild describes the series in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; as &quot;the moral center of my childhood universe.&quot; He also observes that sales of the books have increased since when they were first written. Roger Sale sums it up in his history of children&#x27;s literature: &quot;If L. Frank Baum has a successor, it is Brooks.&quot; Columnist Nicholas Kristof named them among the best children&#x27;s books ever and called them &quot;funny, beautifully written gems.&quot;

==Location of stories==
Nearly all the books focus on the Bean farm and Centerboro area, in Oneida County, upstate New York. Centerboro does not actually exist, nor do the other towns mentioned as being nearest (Aeschylus Center, Gomorrah Falls, South Pharisee, Plutarch Mills, and West Ninevah). However, other towns do exist, described as slightly farther away: Syracuse, Rome, Buffalo, and Utica, New York (mentioned, for example, in &quot;Freddy and the Baseball Team From Mars&quot;). This would put Centerboro somewhere east of Syracuse, close to where Brooks lived as a boy. However, in &quot;Freddy and Mr. Camphor&quot;, the nearby fictional lake Otesaraga is described as &quot;thirty miles around, and only a mile across&quot;. This corresponds closely (and only) to Skaneateles Lake, some ten miles southwest of Syracuse. Regardless, the evidence supplied by Brooks points to the Bean farm being loosely within 30 miles southwest or generally east of Syracuse.

==Illustrations==
The series is illustrated by Kurt Wiese, who became an award-winning illustrator and author (although not for the Freddy series). The first book was originally illustrated by Adolfo Best Maugard but redone by Wiese when the book was re-released. After the first books, the pattern of illustration was established: a half-page black and white drawing at the beginning of each chapter, and a full page black-and-white drawing within each chapter. The covers are line drawings colored with watercolor, each emphasizing a dominant color. The endpapers are two-tone illustrations, loosely matching the cover&#x27;s color theme. For example, the yellow background and blue drawing of the endpapers for &quot;Freddy Rides Again&quot; match the yellow and blue colors of the cover (Freddy, a horse, and a goat are yellow). Wiese drew more than 900 illustrations for the series.

<text>The Regency Bridge, locally known as the &quot;Swinging Bridge,&quot; is a one-lane suspension bridge over the Colorado River in Texas. It is located at the intersection of Mills County Road 433 and San Saba County Road 137, both gravel roads, near a small community called Regency. The bridge spans the Colorado River between Mills and San Saba counties.

==History==
The main span is long, but counting the approach spans, engineers list the bridge’s overall length at . The wooden deck of the bridge is wide. It was built in 1939, with most of the work being done by hand. An earlier bridge constructed in 1903 collapsed under the weight of a herd of cattle, and a later bridge built in 1936 washed away in a flood. The Regency Bridge was restored by James Harris in 1997, with then-Governor Bush attending the re-dedication service. This was a major event for the community of around 25 people.

Local teenagers accidentally set the wood surface on fire on December 29, 2003, burning a hole in some planks and causing $20,000 in damage. The bridge was repaired and reopened to traffic in early 2005. After closing in late 2014, the bridge is once again open to traffic. After a closure in Sept 2020 due to structural damage, the bridge was re-opened to traffic in May 2021.

In 2005, the Regency Bridge became the last suspension bridge in Texas open to automobile traffic.

==Commemoration==
A nearby historical marker, located on the southeast side of the intersection of FM 574 and Mills County Road 433 (which is just east of the intersection of FM 45 and FM 574) reads:
==In popular culture==
*The bridge is included in the opening credits for &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot;.
*In 2017 Regency Bridge was featured on an episode of The Daytripper with Chet Garner as part of the San Saba episode. 
*In 2005, Alton and Sue Watson founded the There&#x27;s Something In The Water Songwriter Festival featuring musicians and songwriters from Texas, Oklahoma, and other regions. The annual festival was held for 12 years on the third weekend in April at an old campground located on the Mills County side of the river.
*&quot;World Without Waves&quot; was filmed in the area and featured the Regency bridge in several scenes.

<doc id="1249613" wikidata="Q914699" url="?curid=1249613" title="Serekh">
<text>In Egyptian hieroglyphs, a serekh is a rectangular enclosure representing the niched or gated façade of a palace surmounted by (usually) the Horus falcon, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name. The serekh was the earliest convention used to set apart the royal name in ancient Egyptian iconography, predating the later and better known cartouche by four dynasties and five to seven hundred years.

==Appearance==

A serekh was an ornamental vignette combining a view of a palace façade and a plan (top view) of the royal courtyard. The term &quot;serekh&quot; derives from the Egyptian word for &quot;façade&quot;. Different serekhs on different types of object display countless variations of the façade decor in its complexity and detail. It seems that no strict artistic rules for the design of the serekh itself existed.

==History==

The serekh first appears as an ornamental miniature during the late Gerzeh culture, when it was used as a royal crest only. From the Old Kingdom period onward, the first uses of the full written word appear in old papyri.
A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, accentuating and honouring the name of the pharaoh. Its use can be dated back as early as the Gerzeh culture (). The hieroglyphs forming the king&#x27;s name were placed inside a rectangular extension atop the serekh, which represented the royal courtyard. Additionally, the falcon of the god Horus, or in a few cases the Set animal, topped the serekh, showing the celestial patron of the named king.

If the word &quot;serekh&quot; was written in full letters (as shown in the infobox above), sometimes accompanied by a miniature of the serekh, it could also be used in text.

One of the most important elements of royal display and identity in ancient Egypt was the king&#x27;s name, important as pharaohs were concerned that future generations remain aware of their reigns. These were first seen from rulers as early as those of Dynasty 0 and continued to be used by kings throughout the history of ancient Egypt. For example, a serekh of Senusret I, who was a king during the Twelfth Dynasty, has been found and is now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The serekhs of kings from the 30th Dynasty can also be seen. The serekh represented the king&#x27;s palace shown in a combination of plan and elevation. The rectangular enclosure represented the plan while the patterned area represented the elevation of the façade. A serekh incised or painted in ink on a vessel denoted that the contents were the produce and/or property of the royal court. The serekh containing the king&#x27;s name was used on a variety of objects and made a fundamental statement of royal ideology. The king&#x27;s name was written in hieroglyphs and the Horus falcon, in reference to the sky god Horus, usually surmounted it.

The Horus name is the first of five royal titles that were in use by the Fifth Dynasty. The second title is the (He of the) Two Ladies, representing the king as manifesting, and under the protection of, the goddesses Nekhbet of Elkab and Hierakonpolis in Upper Egypt, and Wadjet of Buto in Lower Egypt. The third title is the Horus of Gold, with the Horus falcon above the hieroglyphic sign for gold. The fourth title is often translated as &quot;He of the Sedge and Bee&quot;, with the sedge plant symbolic of Upper Egypt and the bee symbolic of Lower Egypt. This is also known as nswt-bìty, a title which expressed the many dualities over which the king exercised rule: Upper and Lower Egypt, the Black Land of cultivation and the Red Land of desert, the realms of day and night, and the natural and the supernatural. The fifth title is Son of Ra. This name claims a direct solar origin for the king as child of the sun-god. The Horus name was commonly written in the serekhs of ancient Egypt. There are a couple of cases in which the Horus name appears without serekhs, and only Peribsen and Khasekhemwy have serekhs without the Horus name.

==Horus==

The king&#x27;s name was written in hieroglyphs and the Horus falcon, in reference to the god Horus, usually surmounted it. As a result, the king&#x27;s name in the serekh came to be known by Egyptologists as his &#x27;Horus name.&#x27; The writing of the king&#x27;s name within the serekh symbolized the king in his palace as the center of royal administration and power. The serekh as a whole was therefore a symbol of kingship. The presence of the Horus falcon showed that the living king was a manifestation of the god. Additionally, the Horus names of several First Dynasty kings expressed the aggressive authority of Horus, perhaps reflecting the coercive power of kingship at this early stage of Egyptian statehood. Examples of such names are &#x27;Horus the fighter&#x27; (Hor-Aha), &#x27;Horus the strong&#x27; (Djer), and &#x27;arm-raising Horus&#x27; (Qa&#x27;a). All of these names reveal the warlike iconography of the earliest royal monuments from the period of state formation. They emphasize an authority based upon military strength and the power of life and death. The emphasis in the Second Dynasty, however, began to change possibly due to the periods of instability that the kings faced, though the exact reason is still disputed. This led to a slight alteration in the structure of the serekh, solely during the reigns of Peribsen and Khasekhemwy. Since this alteration only occurred during these two reigns, it is seen as an exception, as the succeeding kings returned to the previous iconography.

==Progression==

The earliest serekhs were empty because the symbol alone relayed the necessary message of royal power. Over time, the king began to write an epithet within the serekh. These serekhs were dominated by the symbol of Horus. During the Second Dynasty only, changes in the formulation of the Horus name to a Seth-name and then a Horus-and-Seth name were seen. These changes occurred merely during the Second Dynasty and are viewed as an exception to the typical use of the Horus name as is evidenced by the continued use of Horus in the serekhs of the Egyptian kings before and after Peribsen and Khasekhemwy. Many propositions have been made as to why this change occurred, though the exact reason is still disputed.

==Peribsen and Khasekhemwy==

For reasons which remain unclear, Seth attained particular prominence in the late Second Dynasty, temporarily replacing, then joining, Horus as the god atop the royal &quot;serekh&quot;. When the name Peribsen, who was the penultimate king of the Second Dynasty, was written in a serekh, it was surmounted, not by the usual Horus falcon hieroglyph, but by the Seth animal, a hound or jackal-like creature with a wide, straight tail.

Peribsen thus made a visual statement that he was the earthly embodiment of Seth. The importance of Seth in the reign of Peribsen was also reflected in a sealing of the king from Abydos. It referred to a god named &#x27;the golden one&#x27; or, perhaps more likely, &#x27;he of Nubt (Naqada)&#x27;, the usual epithet of Seth in historic times. It appears as though Seth was adopted by &quot;Peribsen&quot; as his personal deity. This is emphasized by the wording of the inscription: &#x27;He of Nubt has handed over the Two Lands to his son, the dual king Peribsen&#x27;.
One interpretation of this dramatic change in the format of the royal name is that it represented a rebellion of some kind that was quashed or reconciled by the last king of the dynasty, Khasekhemwy, whose name appeared in serekhs surmounted by both the Horus falcon and the Seth animal. Originally known as &quot;Khasekhem&quot;, which means &#x27;The One who Arises in respect of the Power&#x27;, his name eventually came to be known as &quot;Khasekhemwy&quot; which means &#x27;The One who Arises in respect of the Two Powers&#x27;. The &#x27;Two Powers&#x27; in his name have been interpreted by some as the Horus falcon and the Seth animal. The addition to Khasekhem&#x27;s name is further evidence that he was trying to merge the ideas of both Horus and Seth.

While the validity of this proposal is debatable, Khasekhemwy&#x27;s epithet from seal impressions supports this notion. It is interpreted as &#x27;the Two Lords are at peace in him&#x27; which can be viewed as though he resolved some internal conflict, especially if &#x27;Two Lords&#x27; are seen as referring to Horus and Seth and their followers, respectively. Others have viewed this evidence as a way of proclaiming national renewal under Khasekhemwy as he was able to reunite Upper and Lower Egypt. This idea remains speculative, however, due to the lack of hard evidence to support this notion. Nonetheless, it seems likely that foreign relations reached a new level under Khasekhemwy, since a seal-impression of his reign showed the first occurrence of the title ìmì-r3 h3st which means &#x27;overseer of foreign land(s)&#x27;. It strongly suggests the imposition of Egyptian hegemony on foreign territory.

The change of the deity image on a serekh was significant: While the king&#x27;s name sometimes appeared in a serekh without an image of a deity above, no deity other than Horus is so far known to have occurred on the serekh of a king until the reign of Peribsen. However, the serekhs of some queens had other deities above. And example is Neithotep&#x27;s, whose serekh had the goddess Neith&#x27;s emblems above it. Due to evidence that Peribsen&#x27;s stelae were subjected to erasure of the Seth animals, it has been inferred that whatever reasons Peribsen had for substituting his falcon failed to win acceptance among royal generations after Khasekhemwy.

<text>The Writers Guild of America (WGA) credit system for motion pictures and television programs covers all works under the jurisdiction of the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) and the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW). The WGA, originally the Screen Writers Guild, has since 1941 been the final arbiter of who receives credit for writing a theatrical, television or new media motion picture written under its jurisdiction.

The system has rules on how writers should be billed during the credits. A variety of credit forms can be given to indicate technicalities such as whether a writer contributed to the original source material, the chronological order of contributors working on different drafts, or whether there were writing teams. Since its inception, writers must have contributed at least 33 percent of a final script to receive credit, and only a certain number of writers can receive credit.

A determination process for screen credits first sees the production company submit proposed credits; about a third of these are challenged and taken to arbitration. This process asks all writing parties involved to provide evidence and supporting statements to help determine how much of the final product was each writer&#x27;s work. However, several of the WGA&#x27;s arbitration decisions have been criticized by WGA members, including how the process handles existing source material that is adapted to the screen, or whether writers of a particular draft should still be credited if subsequent drafts completely removed their contributions.

==Background==
===Rationale===
Writing credits affect the career of writers, as well as their reputation and union membership.

Writers trade on the reputation of their name; John Howard Lawson, the first president of the Screen Writers Guild (SWG; now the Writers Guild of America, WGA), said that &quot;a writer&#x27;s name is his most cherished possession. It is his creative personality, the symbol of the whole body of his ideas and experience.&quot; Not having their name on a film&#x27;s credits will not only cost the writer residuals, but also hinder them from finding future work, depending on the film&#x27;s success. A writer may also be given a bonus if their name is in the credits, as films often have many more contributing writers than the credits show.

The credit system can affect eligibility for membership in the trade union, as one way in which a person becomes a member of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) is by accruing &quot;points&quot; based on the individual&#x27;s writing credits. Membership points are also accrued through employment by, or sale or option to, a company signatory to the Minimum Basic Agreement (MBA), a deal struck between the WGA and a collection of studios and production companies every three years, in which the companies agree to certain minimum fees, residuals, and other benefits for WGA writers they contract. It is negotiated by a committee of the WGA.

===Screen Writers Guild credit system===
The early industry had taken efforts to prevent writers from unionizing. Although the SWG was formed in 1933, it encountered resistance until May 1941, when it signed a deal with the studios that gave the Guild, among other rights, the final say on writing credits. The agreement was seen as weak, as it mostly covered the lowest paid writers, and credits were still unfairly given in the compulsory collaboration era when studios employed large numbers of independent writers on projects; at this point, the need for writers to have contributed 33 percent of the final script had been established, which left many out of credits on productions written by committee. The best paid writers, on the other hand, had always been respected and could often elect to work alone because of their status.

==Credits process==
All writers on a project have the right to know who else has written on that project. Under the MBA a production is required to tell all new writers who has preceded them; a writer may conversely ask the production for the names of those who contributed after them. Writers also bear responsibilities to make sure they are informed, and to inform other writers on the same project that they are working for it; they must also file their contract with the appropriate Guild within a week of receiving it. For television productions of a motion picture over 90 minutes, the production company must inform, in writing, all writers of the writers who follow them. 

The MBA stipulates also that the production company must supply all participant writers—anyone who has contributed, or been hired to contribute, written material; anyone who has been paid for their prior written material whether purchased or licensed; anyone who contributed in any of the aforementioned ways to the original script, in the case of a remake—and the Writers Guild a notice of tentative credits, and give all participant writers a copy of either the shooting script or latest revised script, promptly upon the conclusion of photography. Any participant writer, even deceased, has the right to be involved in the credit determination process (this may be through a representative, such as an agent). Up to three writers, or two teams of writers in film and three teams of writers in television, may receive credit for a production. The Writers Guild has the right to protest any company&#x27;s proposed credits, regardless of whether the writers do.

To determine credits, &quot;it is vital that the writer keep copies of all work done&quot;, and submit copies to the Writers Guild promptly upon completion. Scripts as well as substantial story ideas and other literary material are counted for credit decisions. When there is more than one participant writer on a production, &quot;all participants have the right to agree unanimously among themselves as to which of them shall receive writing credits on the screen and in what form&quot;, as long as the agreed form meets requirements. The MBA also establishes that the agreed form &quot;shall not be suggested or directed by the [production] Company&quot;.

The Writers Guild also officially presumes that any writer has access to all prior material written for the project during their employment, underscoring credits given to prior writers who have been removed from projects. Materials used for research are not credited, but source material as defined by the WGA receives credits. The appropriate credit to use for source material is anything indicative of the nature and relationship of the source material and the final script, with the WGA providing the examples &quot;From a Play by, From a Novel by, Based upon a Story by, From a series of articles by, Based upon a [teleplay/Screenplay] by&quot;.

Once a writer has received both the notice of tentative credits and the final script, they can either agree with the production&#x27;s tentative credits, in which case they do nothing, they can discuss the credits with the other writers through the Writers Guild, or they can challenge the tentative credits within a certain time period. If a participant writer disagrees with the credits, but there are other participants and it is seen that an agreement may be reached between them, the Screen/Television Credits Administrator must make a best attempt to arrange discussion between all writers before arbitration is sought.

==Credit forms==
===Teams===
Credits are handled differently for individual writers and for &quot;teams&quot;. A team of writers is defined by the WGA as &quot;two writers who have been assigned at about the same time to the same material and who work together for approximately the same length of time on the material&quot;; the work of the two writers is considered a joint contribution, not creditable to only one of them or to one more than the other. For the purpose of credits (and to discourage later disputes), one of the writers must openly question the designation of their contributions being part of a team at the time the work is submitted to the Writers Guild if they wish to be credited in another way. A team is credited with an ampersand (&amp;) separating their names. Team credits are more complex when one of the team has also been hired as an additional writer: both writers in the team must form an agreement to allow the additional writer to take the shared credit. Multiple writers who are not part of a team have the word &quot;and&quot; separating their names.

===Written by===
The &quot;Written by&quot; credit is for writers who can claim both the story and screenplay/teleplay elements, except when there is &quot;source material of a story nature&quot;. There are some restrictions on producers and directors of a work being given writing credits, particularly that they cannot receive the story/screenplay/teleplay credit unless there are either no other writers for the story/screenplay/teleplay or the decision is taken to arbitration, and that the Writers Guild must have been notified of a writing team (intending to claim credits) that includes a producer/director and a non-producer/director at the commencement of the team&#x27;s work together. In television, a written by credit is also usually given to writers on variety shows and audience participation shows.

===Screenplay by===
A &quot;Screenplay by&quot; credit may also be used, when the writers for the story and screenplay are different, or in similar circumstances to a screen story credit (either if the work is not mostly original, or in addition to the screen story credit). No more than two writers can share a screenplay credit except in cases of arbitration. From arbitration, screenplay credits can be given to either three individual writers or two teams of writers. For the purposes of arbitration, to be awarded a screenplay credit, the writer must have contributed more than 33 percent of the final screenplay. In the case of an original screenplay, Writers who did not write the original must contribute more than 50 percent to receive the credit. The WGA acknowledges the difficulty in determining such percentages. The television equivalent of the screenplay by credit is &quot;Teleplay by&quot;, and it is used in the same way.

===Story by===
The MBA describes story as &quot;distinct from [screenplay/teleplay] and consisting of basic narrative, idea, theme or outline indicating character development and action&quot;. A &quot;Story by&quot; credit is used when the writer was hired (as a WGA member) to write for story, when the story idea was purchased from the writer by a WGA signatory company, or when the resultant script is based on a sequel story devised by the writer under the WGA&#x27;s jurisdiction. The &quot;Story by&quot; credit cannot be shared by more than two writers in film and three in television, and the story may have been written in different literary forms, including a film treatment. A &quot;Screen Story by&quot; or &quot;Television Story by&quot; credit is used for the screenwriter when their work is based on, but substantially different from, source material and a story as they are defined by the WGA. Screen story credit also cannot be shared by more than two writers, and is a credit that is only handled through arbitration. The writer of the source material for the screen story may receive a source material credit.

===Separated rights===
Television also has a &quot;Created by&quot; and a &quot;Developed (for Television) by&quot; credit under a crediting structure known as separated rights. Writers entitled to created by credits will have developed a significant part of the format, story, and teleplay, and also get sequel rights to the material. Created by credits are given on every episode, while Developed (for Television) by credits are only given on the episodes the writer has explicitly contributed material to.

===Other forms===
Other writing credits that may be used are &quot;Narration Written by&quot;, &quot;Based on Characters Created by&quot;, and &quot;Adaptation by&quot;. A &quot;Special Material by&quot; credit can be given to writers on some forms of television shows, when they have contributed written material that does not qualify for other credits; there are no limits to how many people may receive this credit.

Screenwriter Scott Myers, a WGA member and arbiter on &quot;perhaps 10 credit arbitrations&quot;, has questioned why more than three writers cannot be credited, saying, &quot;After the official Written By or Screenplay By credits are determined, why not in end credits add &#x27;Additional Writing Services,&#x27; then list all the other writers? Everybody and their mother who works on a movie gets a credit. Why not all the writers?&quot; 

===Structure and exceptions===
In credits, names are usually ordered by who did the most work. If the order is disagreed upon and the arbitration finds that all writers contributed equally, the names will be ordered chronologically. A pseudonym may be used if the writer is to be paid less than (for film) or less than three times the applicable minimum in their MBA (for television), if the pseudonymous name is deemed reasonable, and if the writer requests this within five business days of the final credits being determined (for film) or within a preset time frame (for television). Before a pseudonym can be used, it must be registered with the Writers Guild.

A writer may withdraw from credit &quot;for personal cause&quot; before the tentative notice is submitted; if the other writers do not agree, it shall be taken to arbitration. A writer cannot withdraw from credit after arbitration. Withdrawing from credit also includes losing rights to and compensation from the material; using a pseudonym does not remove these rights.

==Arbitration==
If there is no agreement on writing credits, the Writers Guild&#x27;s Screen Credits Administrator (for film) or Television Credits Administrator (for television) will begin arbitration proceedings. Three members of the Writers Guild are selected as arbiters, as long as they have no interest in the decision; for film, the members must have either been a member for five years or have three screen credits, and for television, they must have been a member for at least one year and have at least three writing credits. At least two of the selected members must have been on at least two arbitration committees before and, where possible, members who are familiar with the type of writing involved will be chosen. The identity of arbiters is kept anonymous to everyone, including the other arbiters, except the Screen/Television Credits Committee. Also, before selecting the three members, the Screen/Television Arbiters List of all eligible members will be sent to all participant writers, who can preclude from selection a reasonable number of names on it; the selection will be made from the remaining names without question. A member of the Screen/Television Credits Committee will be designated to each arbitration case to advise the arbiters and help them to come to a decision. Film arbitration takes place over 21 business days, and television arbitration over eight.

All participant writers and the production must also cooperate with the committees, most importantly by accurately submitting all written material (original and in triplicate) to be considered, and scrutinizing submitted material. The Writers Guild also advises all writers to submit a written statement to the arbitration committee, outlining their stance and detailing their claim to credit in line with Writers Guild policy; the statement cannot include anything irrelevant to the case, reference to compensation, letters of support from other people, or information on the development that will not help the arbiters in their purely analytical review. 

Participant writers have 24 hours to give their statements, their only means of providing supporting evidence to the arbiters, to the guild. Statements submitted late will be accepted as long as they come before a decision is made. The arbiters thus each receive the tentative writing credits, the writers&#x27; statements, a summary of the issues to be determined in the case, all the written material with a chronological record, a copy of the Screen/Television Credits Manual, and the request that their decision be communicated to the Screen/Television Credits Administrator first by telephone and then in writing.

The writers&#x27; statements are kept private by the WGA. Additionally, the writers&#x27; identities are kept anonymous from the arbiters.

In situations where there is doubt over the authenticity of the submitted written material, a hearing may be held before arbitration, where the writers each provide testimony and evidence as to the authorship, sequence, and legitimacy of the material. The Writers Guild may also request a descriptive script of a film called a &quot;cutting continuity&quot;, or a television production called an &quot;as broadcast&quot; script, which the production must provide if available; particularly, a writer may ask that the Writers Guild request this if they believe the final script is not reflective of what was actually filmed.

The arbiters may not come to unanimous agreement. When this happens, they teleconference with the advisor to, while remaining anonymous to each other, discuss the reasoning for their choices in an attempt to come to a decision. In the absence of a unanimous decision at this stage, a majority decision shall be accepted. The arbitration committee&#x27;s decision, once written confirmation has been received by the Screen/Television Credits Administrator, is communicated to the interested parties. A participant writer may then request an appeal before an internal Policy Review Board of the Writers Guild, within 24 hours of the arbiters&#x27; decision being communicated to them. That board consists of three members of the Screen/Television Credits Committee, usually including either the Chair or Vice-Chair; none should have an interest in the decision. The Policy Review Board only serves to determine if there was any &quot;serious deviation from the policy of the Guild or the procedure as set forth in [the Screen/Television Credits Manual]&quot; through the process of the arbitration, and do not read any of the submitted written materials nor judge the writers&#x27; contributions. The Policy Review Board may annul an arbitration decision, but only if policy regarding decision-making has been broken; if they find this, the arbiters may be asked to reconsider, or a new arbitration committee selected.

Should the screenplay be rewritten after the final credits decision has been made, arbitration may be reopened within 48 hours of the final changes.

WGA members have criticized how the process handles existing material, such as a book that is adapted to film. &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Michele Willens suggests that the first writer to work on such a project will write the most cinematic elements of the story, but other teams that subsequently work on the script may base their work on the original text, rather than the first draft. Barry Levinson, the director of &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, and a disputant over screenwriting credit for the film (which was adapted from a novel), said:
==Notable conflicts==
Frank Pierson, former WGAW president (and former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences), said that &quot;the large majority of credits are still straightforward and uncontested [but] when they go wrong, they go horribly wrong.&quot; Writer-director Phil Alden Robinson has said that &quot;no one can trust the writing credit. Nobody knows who really wrote the film.&quot; From 1993 to 1997, there were 415 arbitrations, about a third of all films with credits submitted.

When Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; was adapted for the screen, Alex Cox and Tod Davies wrote the initial adaptation. When Terry Gilliam was brought in to direct it, he rewrote it with Tony Grisoni. The WGA initially denied Gilliam and Grisoni any credit even though Gilliam claimed that nothing of the original adaptation remained in the final film: &quot;As a director, I was automatically deemed a &#x27;production executive&#x27; by the Guild and, by definition, discriminated against. But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair.&quot; After complaints, the WGA awarded Gilliam and Grisoni credit in addition to Cox and Davies, but Gilliam resigned from the union over the dispute. Gilliam said the arbitration process &quot;[is] really a Star Chamber&quot;, claiming it took more work than the screenplay itself.

Similar problems arose for the film &quot;Ronin&quot;. According to director John Frankenheimer, &quot;the credits should read: Story by J. D. Zeik, screenplay by David Mamet. We didn&#x27;t shoot a line of Zeik&#x27;s script.&quot; Instead, Mamet received credit under a pseudonym. After the controversy over credits for &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, Mamet decided to attach his name only to movies on which he is the sole writer.

A disagreement over the 2–1 arbitration decision denying George Clooney a writing credit for &quot;Leatherheads&quot; led Clooney to become a financial core member of the WGA, rather than an active one. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Michael Fleming wrote that &quot;Clooney took a languishing 17-year-old project and got a greenlight after personally giving the script a major overhaul that transformed it into a screwball comedy&quot;, with Clooney asserting that he wrote almost the entire script, but only Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly, who came up with the original concept, were credited.

<text>Peter Patrick Lorimer (14 December 1946 – 20 March 2021) was a Scottish professional footballer who mainly played for Leeds United and Scotland during the late 1960s and early 1970s. An attacking midfielder and the club&#x27;s youngest-ever player, he was renowned for his very powerful shots from distance. From 1984 to 1985 he was club captain. Lorimer is the club record scorer with 238 goals in all competitions. He was voted Leeds&#x27; ninth greatest player ever and on to the greatest Leeds United team of all time.

After retiring as a player, Lorimer became a member of the Leeds board of directors, provided match commentary on BBC Radio Leeds and Yorkshire Radio and wrote a regular column in the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. From April 2013 he held the position of club ambassador.

==Early life==
Lorimer was born in Dundee to Janet and Peter Lorimer and was brought up in Broughty Ferry on the edge of the city. He attended Eastern Primary School and later Stobswell Secondary School, where he played for the school&#x27;s football team.

==Club career==
===Leeds United===
After playing junior football in Dundee for Stobswell Boys and Broughty YMCA, Lorimer signed for Leeds United in May 1962 after scoring for the Scotland Schoolboys team in a 4–2 win over England. He made his Leeds debut on 29 September 1962 against Southampton, aged 15 years and 289 days, becoming the youngest player to play for the first team.

Lorimer came to regular prominence in the 1965–66 season, making 34 League Championship appearances and scoring 19 goals, more than any other player at Leeds United managed that season. A skilful and industrious player who operated best in a drifting position either wide on the right (though not as an orthodox winger – he was more likely to cut in and shoot than stay wide and cross) or behind two main strikers (usually Allan Clarke and Mick Jones), Lorimer was a frequent and often spectacular goalscorer, earning himself several nicknames stemming from his powerful shooting – &quot;HotShot&quot; and &quot;Lash&quot; being two of the more prevalent. He became renowned for these strikes, with his shots reaching speeds of up to 90 mph. One penalty kick was recorded at 107 mph.

In the 1966–67 season, Lorimer made his first major headlines when a free-kick equaliser against Chelsea in an FA Cup semi-final was controversially ruled out by referee Ken Burns and retaken, for the Chelsea players had not retreated the necessary 10 yards. Chelsea held on to win the game. In the 1975 European Cup Final, Lorimer scored to give Leeds a 1–0 lead, only for the goal to be controversially disallowed by referee Michel Kitabdjian, with Leeds going on to lose the game. In summer 1971, Lorimer had a short spell on loan at Cape Town City in South Africa. Lorimer left the club in 1979, having scored 219 goals in 616 appearances. During this time he had won two League titles, an FA Cup, a League Cup, a Charity Shield, and two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups.

===Later career===
He played for York City and then tried his luck in the North American Soccer League (NASL). Lorimer played for two clubs: the Toronto Blizzard (1979–1980) and the Vancouver Whitecaps (1981–83). In January 1983 he signed for University College Dublin.

Lorimer returned to Leeds United in 1983, aged 37, two seasons after Leeds had fallen into the Football League Second Division. He played under former team-mate Eddie Gray (more than a year his junior) and broke the club&#x27;s goalscoring record in the process, ending up with 238 goals from 705 appearances until retiring just before his 40th birthday at the end of the 1985–86 season. However, Leeds were still a Second Division team when Lorimer played his final game for them and it would be another four years before they returned to the First Division.

==International career==
Lorimer made his international debut for Scotland against Austria in November 1969. He won 21 caps for Scotland and scored four goals, having played in all three of their matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. His Scotland career was, however, affected by a ban imposed on him in 1971 after he spent a summer playing for Cape Town City in apartheid-era South Africa.

==After playing==
In his retirement Lorimer ran the Commercial Inn pub in the Holbeck area of the city. Lorimer remained a dedicated spokesman for Leeds United after retirement – he was always one of the first ex-players to whom broadcasters and journalists turned when the club was in the news. He worked as a pundit at games for BBC Radio Leeds and as a columnist for the local paper, the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;. He wrote a column in the club&#x27;s match programme (his final one being the match against Aston Villa on 27 February 2021) and acted as a summariser for Yorkshire Radio on every Leeds away match.

On 26 February 2021, it was announced that Lorimer had been placed under hospice care due to a long-term illness. He died on 20 March 2021, aged 74.

<text>Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria (SV 325, &quot;The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland&quot;) is an opera consisting of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season. The story, taken from the second half of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.

&quot;Il ritorno&quot; is the first of three full-length works which Monteverdi wrote for the burgeoning Venetian opera industry during the last five years of his life. After its initial successful run in Venice the opera was performed in Bologna before returning to Venice for the 1640–41 season. Thereafter, except for a possible performance at the Imperial court in Vienna late in the 17th century, there were no further revivals until the 20th century. The music became known in modern times through the 19th-century discovery of an incomplete manuscript score which in many respects is inconsistent with the surviving versions of the libretto. After its publication in 1922 the score&#x27;s authenticity was widely questioned, and performances of the opera remained rare during the next 30 years. By the 1950s the work was generally accepted as Monteverdi&#x27;s, and after revivals in Vienna and Glyndebourne in the early 1970s it became increasingly popular. It has since been performed in opera houses all over the world, and has been recorded many times.

Together with Monteverdi&#x27;s other Venetian stage works, &quot;Il ritorno&quot; is classified as one of the first modern operas. Its music, while showing the influence of earlier works, also demonstrates Monteverdi&#x27;s development as a composer of opera, through his use of fashionable forms such as arioso, duet and ensemble alongside the older-style recitative. By using a variety of musical styles, Monteverdi is able to express the feelings and emotions of a great range of characters, divine and human, through their music. &quot;Il ritorno&quot; has been described as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, and conversely as the most tender and moving of Monteverdi&#x27;s surviving operas, one which although it might disappoint initially, will on subsequent hearings reveal a vocal style of extraordinary eloquence.

==Historical context==

Monteverdi was an established court composer in the service of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in Mantua when he wrote his first operas, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot;, in the years 1606–08. After falling out with Vincenzo&#x27;s successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice in 1613 and became director of music at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, a position he held for the rest of his life. Alongside his steady output of madrigals and church music, Monteverdi continued to compose works for the stage, though not actual operas. He wrote several ballets and, for the Venice carnival of 1624–25, &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda&quot;), a hybrid work with some characteristics of ballet, opera and oratorio.

In 1637 fully-fledged opera came to Venice with the opening of the Teatro San Cassiano. Sponsored by the wealthy Tron family, this theatre was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. The theatre&#x27;s inaugural performance, on 6 March 1637, was &quot;L&#x27;Andromeda&quot; by Francesco Manelli and Benedetto Ferrari. This work was received with great enthusiasm, as was the same pair&#x27;s &quot;La Maga fulminata&quot; the following year. In rapid succession three more opera houses opened in the city, as the ruling families of the Republic sought to express their wealth and status by investing in the new musical fashion. At first, Monteverdi remained aloof from these activities, perhaps on account of his age (he was over 70), or perhaps through the dignity of his office as &quot;maestro di capella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s. Nevertheless, an unidentified contemporary, commenting on Monteverdi&#x27;s silence, opined that the maestro might yet produce an opera for Venice: &quot;God willing, one of these nights he too will step onto the stage.&quot; This remark proved prescient; Monteverdi&#x27;s first public contribution to Venetian opera came in the 1639–40 carnival season, a revival of his &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; at the Teatro San Moisè.

&quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot; was followed in rapid succession by three brand new Monteverdi operas, of which &quot;Il ritorno&quot; was the first. The second, &quot;Le nozze d’Enea con Lavinia&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of Aeneas to Lavinia&quot;), was performed during the 1640–41 carnival; Monteverdi&#x27;s music is lost, but a copy of the libretto, of unknown authorship, survives. The last of the three, written for the 1642–43 carnival, was &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (&quot;The Coronation of Poppea&quot;), performed shortly before the composer&#x27;s death in 1643.

==Creation==

===Libretto===

Giacomo Badoaro (1602–1654) was a prolific poet in the Venetian dialect who was a member of the Accademia degli Incogniti, a group of free-thinking intellectuals interested in promoting musical theatre in Venice—Badoaro himself held a financial interest in the Teatro Novissimo. &quot;Il ritorno&quot; was his first libretto; he would later, in 1644, write another Ulysses-based libretto for Francesco Sacrati. The text of &quot;Il ritorno&quot;, originally written in five acts but later reorganised as three, is a generally faithful adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Books 13–23, with some characterisations altered or expanded. Badoaro may have been influenced in his treatment of the story by the 1591 play &quot;Penelope&quot; by Giambattista della Porta. The libretto was written with the express purpose of tempting Monteverdi to enter the world of Venetian opera, and it evidently captured the elderly composer&#x27;s imagination. Badoaro and Monteverdi used a classical story to illustrate the human condition of their own times.

The Monteverdi scholar Ellen Rosand has identified 12 versions of the published libretto that have been discovered in the years since the first performance. Most of these appear to be 18th-century copies, possibly from a single source; some are literary versions, unrelated to any theatrical performances. All but one of the 12 identify Badoaro as the author, while the other gives no name. Only two refer to Monteverdi as the composer, though this is not significant—composers&#x27; names were rarely given on printed librettos. The texts are all generally the same in each case, and all differ from the one surviving copy of Monteverdi&#x27;s musical score, which has three acts instead of five, a different prologue, a different ending, and many scenes and passages either omitted or rearranged. Some of the libretto copies locate the opera&#x27;s first performance at Teatro San Cassiano, although Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo is now generally accepted as the opening venue.

===Composition===
It is not known when Monteverdi received the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was being prepared for performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.

A study of the score reveals many characteristic Monteverdi features, derived from his long experience as a composer for the stage and of other works for the human voice. Rosand believes that rather than casting doubts on Monteverdi&#x27;s authorship, the significant differences between the score and the libretto might lend support to it, since Monteverdi was well known for his adaptations of the texts presented to him. Ringer reinforces this, writing that &quot;Monteverdi boldly reshaped Badoaro&#x27;s writing into a coherent and supremely effective foundation for a music drama&quot;, adding that Badoaro claimed that he could no longer recognise the work as his own. Contemporaries of the composer and the librettist saw an identification between Ulysses and Monteverdi; both are returning home—&quot;home&quot; in Monteverdi&#x27;s case being the medium of opera which he had mastered and then left, 30 years earlier.

===Authenticity===
Before and after the publication of the score in 1922, scholars questioned the work&#x27;s authenticity, and its attribution to Monteverdi continued to be in some doubt until the 1950s. The Italian musicologist Giacomo Benvenuti maintained, on the basis of a 1942 performance in Milan, that the work was simply not good enough to be by Monteverdi. Apart from the stylistic differences between &quot;Il ritorno&quot; and Monteverdi&#x27;s other surviving late opera, &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, the main issue which raised doubts was the series of discrepancies between the score and the libretto. However, much of the uncertainty concerning the attribution was resolved through the discovery of contemporary documents, all confirming Monteverdi&#x27;s role as the composer. These documents include a letter from the unknown librettist of &quot;Le nozze d&#x27;Enea in Lavinia&quot;, which discusses Monteverdi&#x27;s setting of &quot;Il ritorno&quot;. There is also Badoaro&#x27;s preface to the &quot;Il ritorno&quot; libretto, addressed to the composer, which includes the wording &quot;I can firmly state that my Ulysses is more indebted to you than ever was the real Ulysses to the ever-gracious Minerva&quot;. A 1644 letter from Badoaro to Michelangelo Torcigliani contains the statement &quot;&quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; was embellished with the music of Claudio Monteverdi, a man of great fame and enduring name&quot;. Finally, a 1640 booklet entitled &quot;Le Glorie della Musica&quot; indicates the Badoaro-Monteverdi pairing as the creators of the opera. In the view of conductor and instrumentalist Sergio Vartolo, these findings establish Monteverdi as the principal composer &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot;. Although parts of the music may be by other hands, there is no doubt that the work is substantially Monteverdi&#x27;s and remains close to his original conception.

== Roles ==
The work is written for a large cast—thirty roles including small choruses of heavenly beings, sirens and Phaecians—but these parts can be organised among fourteen singers (three sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, one alto, six tenors and two basses) by appropriate doubling of roles. This approximates to the normal forces employed in Venetian opera. In the score, the role of Eumete changes midway through Act II from tenor to soprano castrato, suggesting that the surviving manuscript may have been created from more than one source. In modern performances the latter part of Eumete&#x27;s role is usually transposed to a lower range, to accommodate the tenor voice throughout.

==Synopsis==
The action takes place on and around the island of Ithaca, ten years after the Trojan Wars. English translations used in the synopsis are from Geoffrey Dunn&#x27;s version, based on Raymond Leppard&#x27;s 1971 edition, and from Hugh Ward-Perkins&#x27;s interpretation issued with Sergio Vartolo&#x27;s 2006 recording for Brilliant Classics.
Footnotes provide the original Italian.

===Prologue===
The spirit of human frailty (l&#x27;humana Fragilità) is mocked in turn by the gods of time (il Tempo), fortune (la Fortuna) and love (l&#x27;Amore). Man, they claim, is subject to their whims: &quot;From Time, ever fleeting, from Fortune&#x27;s caresses, from Love and its arrows...No mercy from me!&quot; They will render man &quot;weak, wretched, and bewildered.&quot;

===Act 1===

In the palace at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: &quot;The awaited one does not return, and the years pass by.&quot; Her grief is echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her attendant Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope&#x27;s importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their love for each other (&quot;You are my sweet life&quot;). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: &quot;To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!&quot; From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of &quot;the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope&quot;, in the face of the persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse&#x27;s son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: &quot;Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?&quot; In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors&#x27; parasitic follower, who sneers: &quot;I live among kings, you here among the herds.&quot; After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: &quot;My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you.&quot;

===Act 2===

Minerva and Telemaco return to Ithaca in a chariot. Telemaco is greeted joyfully by Eumete and the disguised Ulisse in the woodland grove: &quot;O great son of Ulysses, you have indeed returned!&quot; After Eumete goes to inform Penelope of Telemaco&#x27;s arrival a bolt of fire descends on Ulisse, removing his disguise and revealing his true identity to his son. The two celebrate their reunion before Ulisse sends Telemaco to the palace, promising to follow shortly. In the palace, Melanto complains to Eurimaco that Penelope still refuses to choose a suitor: &quot;In short, Eurymachus, the lady has a heart of stone.&quot; Soon afterwards Penelope receives the three suitors (Antinoo, Pisandro, Anfinomo), and rejects each in turn despite their efforts to enliven the court with singing and dancing: &quot;Now to enjoyment, to dance and song!&quot; After the suitors&#x27; departure Eumete tells Penelope that Telemaco has arrived in Ithaca, but she is doubtful: &quot;Such uncertain things redouble my grief.&quot; Eumete&#x27;s message is overheard by the suitors, who plot to kill Telemaco. However, they are unnerved when a symbolic eagle flies overhead, so they abandon their plan and renew their efforts to capture Penelope&#x27;s heart, this time with gold. Back in the woodland grove, Minerva tells Ulisse that she has organised a means whereby he will be able to challenge and destroy the suitors. Resuming his beggar&#x27;s disguise, Ulisse arrives at the palace, where he is challenged to a fight by Iro, (&quot;I will pluck out the hairs of your beard one by one!&quot;), a challenge he accepts and wins. Penelope now states that she will accept the suitor who is able to string Ulisse&#x27;s bow. All three suitors attempt the task unsuccessfully. The disguised Ulisse then asks to try though renouncing the prize of Penelope&#x27;s hand, and to everyone&#x27;s amazement he succeeds. He then angrily denounces the suitors and, summoning the names of the gods, kills all three with the bow: &quot;This is how the bow wounds! To death, to havoc, to ruin!&quot;

===Act 3===
Deprived of the suitors&#x27; patronage, Iro commits suicide after a doleful monologue (&quot;O grief, O torment that saddens the soul!&quot;) Melanto, whose lover Eurimaco was killed with the suitors, tries to warn Penelope of the new danger represented by the unidentified slayer, but Penelope is unmoved and continues to mourn for Ulisse. Eumete and Telemaco now inform her that the beggar was Ulisse in disguise, but she refuses to believe them: &quot;Your news is persistent and your comfort hurtful.&quot; The scene briefly transfers to the heavens, where Giunone, having been solicited by Minerva, persuades Giove and Nettune that Ulisse should be restored to his throne. Back in the palace the nurse Ericlea has discovered Ulisse&#x27;s identity by recognising a scar on his back, but does not immediately reveal this information: &quot;Sometimes the best thing is a wise silence.&quot; Penelope continues to disbelieve, even when Ulisse appears in his true form and when Ericlea reveals her knowledge of the scar. Finally, after Ulisse describes the pattern of Penelope&#x27;s private bedlinen, knowledge that only he could possess, she is convinced. Reunited, the pair sing rapturously to celebrate their love: &quot;My sun, long sighed for! My light, renewed!&quot;

==Reception and performance history==

===Early performances===
&quot;Il ritorno&quot; was first staged during the 1639–40 Venice carnival by the theatrical company of Manelli and Ferrari, who had first brought opera to Venice. The date of the &quot;Il ritorno&quot; première is not recorded.
According to Carter the work was performed at least ten times during its first season; it was then taken by Manelli to Bologna, and played at the Teatro Castrovillani before returning to Venice for the 1640–41 carnival season. From markings in the extant score, it is likely that the first Venice performances were in five acts, the three-act form being introduced either in Bologna or in the second Venice season. A theory offered by Italian opera historian Nino Pirrotta that the Bologna performance was the work&#x27;s première is not supported by subsequent research. The opera&#x27;s revival in Venice only one season after its première was very unusual, almost unique in the 17th century, and testifies to the opera&#x27;s popular success—Ringer calls it &quot;one of the most successful operas of the century&quot;. Carter offers a reason for its appeal to the public: &quot;The opera has enough sex, gore and elements of the supernatural to satisfy the most jaded Venetian palate.&quot;

The venue for &quot;Il ritorno&#x27;s&quot; première was at one time thought to be the Teatro Cassiano, but scholarly consensus considers it most likely that both the 1639–40 and 1640–41 performances were at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. This view is supported by a study of the performance schedules for other Venice operas, and by the knowledge that the Manelli company had severed its connection with the Teatro Cassiano before the 1639–40 season. The Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, owned by the Grimani family, would also be the venue for the premières of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze d&#x27;Enea&quot; and &quot;Poppea&quot;. In terms of its staging &quot;Il ritorno&quot; is, says Carter, fairly undemanding, requiring three basic sets—a palace, a seascape and a woodland scene—which were more or less standard for early Venetian opera. It did, however, demand some spectacular special effects: the Phaecian ship turns to stone, an airborne chariot transports Minerva, a bolt of fire transforms Ulisse.

After the Venice 1640–41 revival there is no record of further performances of &quot;Il ritorno&quot; in Venice, or elsewhere, before the discovery of the music manuscript in the 19th century. The discovery of this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript&#x27;s arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor Leopold I who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.

===Modern revivals===

The Vienna manuscript score was published by Robert Haas in 1922. Publication was followed by the first modern performance of the opera, in an edition by Vincent d&#x27;Indy, in Paris on 16 May 1925. For the next half-century performances remained rare. The BBC introduced the opera to British listeners with a radio broadcast on 16 January 1928, again using the d&#x27;Indy edition. The Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola prepared his own edition, which was performed in Florence in 1942, and Ernst Krenek&#x27;s version was shown in Wuppertal, Germany, in 1959. The first British staging was a performance at St. Pancras Town Hall, London, on 16 March 1965, given with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Frederick Marshall.

The opera entered a wider repertory in the early 1970s, with performances in Vienna (1971) and Glyndebourne (1972). The Vienna performance used a new edition prepared by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, whose subsequent partnership with the French opera director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle led to the staging of the opera in many European cities. Ponnelle&#x27;s 1978 presentation in Edinburgh was later described as &quot;infamous&quot;; at the time, critic Stanley Sadie praised the singers but criticised the production for its &quot;frivolity and indeed coarseness&quot;. In January 1974 &quot;Il ritorno&quot; received its United States première with a production mounted by the Opera Society of Washington at the Kennedy Center, on the basis of the Harnoncourt edition. Led by conductor Alexander Gibson, the cast included Frederica von Stade as L&#x27;humana Fragilità and Penelope, Claude Corbeil as Il Tempo and Antinoo, Joyce Castle as La Fortuna, Barbara Hocher as Amore and Melanto, Richard Stilwell as Ulisse, Donald Gramm as Nettuno, William Neill as Giove, Carmen Balthrop as Minerva, David Lloyd as Eumete, R. G. Webb as Iro, Howard Hensel as Eurimaco, Paul Sperry as Telemaco, Dennis Striny as Pisandro, and John Lankston as Anfinomo.

More recently the opera has been performed at the New York Lincoln Center by New York City Opera, and at other venues throughout the United States. A 2006 Welsh National Opera production by David Alden, designed by Ian McNeil, featured neon signs, stuffed cats, a Neptune in flippers and a wet suit, Minerva in the form of the aviator Amelia Earhart, and Jupiter as a small-time hustler, an interpretation defended by the critic Anna Picard – &quot;the gods were always contemporary fantasies, while an abandoned wife and a humbled hero are eternals.&quot;

The German composer Hans Werner Henze was responsible for the first two-act version, which was produced at the Salzburg Festival on 11 August 1985, with divided critical reaction. Two-act productions have since become increasingly common. The South African artist and animator William Kentridge devised a version of the opera based on the use of puppets and animated film, using around half of the music. This version was shown in Johannesburg in 1998 and then toured the world, appearing at the Lincoln Center in 2004 and at the Edinburgh Festival in 2009.

==Music==
According to Denis Arnold, although Monteverdi&#x27;s late operas retain elements of the earlier Renaissance intermezzo and pastoral forms, they may be fairly considered as the first modern operas. In the 1960s, however, David Johnson found it necessary to warn prospective &quot;Il ritorno&quot; listeners that if they expected to hear opera akin to Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, they would be disappointed: &quot;You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first or second hearing merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.&quot; A few years later, Jeremy Noble in a &quot;Gramophone&quot; review wrote that &quot;Il ritorno&quot; was the least known and least performed of Monteverdi&#x27;s operas, &quot;quite frankly, because its music is not so consistently full of character and imagination as that of Orfeo or Poppea.&quot; Arnold called the work an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. Later analysts have been more positive; to Mark Ringer &quot;Il ritorno&quot; is &quot;the most tender and moving of Monteverdi&#x27;s operas&quot;, while in Ellen Rosand&#x27;s view the composer&#x27;s ability to portray real human beings through music finds its fullest realisation here, and in &quot;Poppea&quot; a few years later.
The music of &quot;Il ritorno&quot; shows the unmistakable influence of the composer&#x27;s earlier works. Penelope&#x27;s lament, which opens Act I, is reminiscent both of Orfeo&#x27;s &quot;Redentemi il mio ben&quot; and the lament from &quot;L&#x27;Arianna&quot;. The martial-sounding music which accompanies references to battles and the killing of the suitors, derives from &quot;Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda&quot;, while for the song episodes in &quot;Il ritorno&quot; Monteverdi draws in part on the techniques which he developed in his 1632 vocal work &quot;Scherzi musicale&quot;. In typical Monteverdi fashion the opera&#x27;s characters are vividly portrayed in their music. Penelope and Ulisse, with what is described by Ringer as &quot;honest musical and verbal declamation&quot;, overcome the suitors whose styles are &quot;exaggerated and ornamental&quot;. Iro, perhaps &quot;the first great comic character in opera&quot;, opens his Act 3 monologue with a wail of distress that stretches across eight bars of music. Penelope begins her lament with a reiteration of E flats that, according to Ringer, &quot;suggest a sense of motionless and emotional stasis&quot; that well represents her condition as the opera begins. At the work&#x27;s end, her travails over, she unites with Ulisse in a duet of life-affirming confidence which, Ringer suggests, no other composer bar Verdi could have achieved.

Rosand divides the music of &quot;Il ritorno&quot; into &quot;speech-like&quot; and &quot;musical&quot; utterances. Speech, usually in the form of recitative, delivers information and moves the action forward, while musical utterances, either formal songs or occasional short outbursts, are lyrical passages that enhance an emotional or dramatic situation. This division is, however, less formal than in Monteverdi&#x27;s earlier &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;; in &quot;Il ritorno&quot; information is frequently conveyed through the use of arioso, or even aria at times, increasing both tunefulness and tonal unity. As with &quot;Orfeo&quot; and &quot;Poppea&quot;, Monteverdi differentiates musically between humans and gods, with the latter singing music which is usually more profusely melodic—although in &quot;Il ritorno&quot;, most of the human characters have some opportunity for lyrical expression. According to the reviewer Iain Fenlon, &quot;it is Monteverdi&#x27;s mellifluous and flexible recitative style, capable of easy movement between declamation and arioso, which remains in the memory as the dominant language of the work.&quot; Monteverdi&#x27;s ability to combine fashionable forms such as the chamber duet and ensembles with the older-style recitative from earlier in the century further illustrate the development of the composer&#x27;s dramatic style. Monteverdi&#x27;s trademark feature of &quot;stilo concitato&quot; (rapid repetition of notes to suggest dramatic action or excitement) is deployed to good effect in the fight scene between Ulisse and Iro, and in the slaying of the suitors. Arnold draws attention to the great range of characters in the opera—the divine, the noble, the servants, the evil, the foolish, the innocent and the good. For all of these &quot;the music expresses their emotions with astonishing accuracy.&quot;

==List of musical items==
The following is a list of the &quot;scenes&quot; into which the libretto is divided. Each separate scene is typically a mixture of musical elements: recitative, arioso, arietta and sometimes ensemble, with occasional instrumental interludes.
==Recording history==

The first recording of the opera was issued in 1964 by Vox, a version which incorporated substantial cuts. The first complete recording was that of Harnoncourt and Concentus Musicus Wien in 1971. Raymond Leppard&#x27;s 1972 Glyndebourne version was recorded in a concert performance in the Royal Albert Hall; the following year the same Glyndebourne cast was recorded in a full stage performance. Leppard&#x27;s third Glyndebourne version was issued in 1980, when the orchestration with strings and brass drew critical comment from Denis Arnold in his &quot;Gramophone&quot; review: &quot;Too much of the music left with a simple basso continuo line in the original has been fully orchestrated with strings and brass, with the result that the expressive movement between recitative, arioso and aria is obscured.&quot; (For further details, see Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria (Raymond Leppard recording).) Much the same criticism, says Arnold, may be levelled at Harnoncourt&#x27;s 1971 recording.

Among more recent issues is the much praised 1992 René Jacobs performance with Concerto Vocale, &quot;a recording that all serious Monteverdians will wish to return to frequently&quot;, according to Fenlon. Jacobs&#x27;s version is in the original five-act form, and uses music by Luigi Rossi and Giulio Caccini for some choruses which appear in the libretto but which are missing from Monteverdi&#x27;s score. More than thirty years after his first issue, Harnoncourt&#x27;s 2002 version, with Zurich Opera, was recorded live in DVD format. While the quality of the vocal contributions were praised, Harnoncourt&#x27;s &quot;big-band score&quot; and bold instrumentation were highlighted by &quot;Gramophone&quot; critic Jonathan Freeman-Attwood as a likely source of future debate.

<doc id="1249637" wikidata="Q5097812" url="?curid=1249637" title="Child advocacy">
<text>Child advocacy refers to a range of individuals, professionals and advocacy organizations who speak out on the best interests of children. An individual or organization engaging in advocacy typically seeks to protect children&#x27;s rights which may be abridged or abused in a number of areas.

== Rights ==
== What child advocates do ==

A child advocate typically represents or gives voice to children whose concerns and interests are not being heard. Child advocacy can be done at the micro level (for one child or a few children), mezzo level (for group of children or at a community level) or macro level (for a category of children affected by a social issue). A child advocate will try to prevent children from being harmed and may try to obtain justice for those who have already been injured in some way. A child advocate may also seek to ensure that children have access to resources or services which will benefit their lives such as education, childcare and proper parenting. Malnutrition is another form of harm-there are many children who go to bed without eating and it is looked over by child welfare or the police.

Another form of child advocacy happens at the policy level and aims at changing the policies of governments or even transnational policies. These advocates do lobbying, policy research, file lawsuits and engage in other types of policy change techniques. Many use Internet based techniques to influence decision makers.

== Where child advocates can be found ==

Several countries have established Children&#x27;s Ombudsman agencies, at national, sub-national or local levels, as independent public bodies promoting and protecting the rights of children. Other child advocates exist in school, community, and home environments, and work on an individual, group or governmental level(s) to protect and nurture children. In most circumstances, mothers, fathers, family and teachers all advocate on behalf of children, although it is well recognized that we all have the ability and responsibility to advocate on behalf of children. In Wales the Welsh Assembly Government has set up the National Advocacy Meic helpline which allows children to talk directly to advocates. These independent advocates support and represent the concerns of children.

Eight Canadian provinces, including Ontario, have an official child advocate whose job it is to protect the interests and welfare of all the children in the province. Within the criminal justice system, child advocates are concerned with the developmental needs of children and young people, and can play an important role in ensuring due process rights for young people in conflict with the law. They can help provide a voice for children and young people, ensure just and humane conditions of custody, and guard the privacy rights surrounding record provisions. They can also work to ensure that the special legal protections assigned to young people are provided with dignity and fairness.

=== Child advocacy centers ===
Child advocacy centers (CAC) provide a child-friendly, safe and neutral location in which law enforcement and Child Protective Services investigators may conduct and observe forensic interviews with children who are alleged victims of crimes, and where the child and non-offending family members receive support, crisis intervention and referrals for mental health and medical treatment. The Child advocacy center model&#x27;s main objective is to reduce trauma to child victims by bringing all disciplines together and sharing information more efficiently to minimize duplication. CACs coordinate multidisciplinary teams composed of law enforcement officers, child protective service personnel, prosecutors, advocates, mental health therapists and medical personnel. The multidisciplinary team meets regularly to communicate and collaborate on child maltreatment cases. Cases are reviewed beginning with the victim’s initial outcry through investigation, treatment and prosecution. Communication within the team reduces duplication and mistakes, and keeps victims from falling through the cracks.

A child forensic interview is a process where a child is given the opportunity to make a statement about what happened in a private, safe, supportive environment. The child is questioned in a legally-sound, developmentally appropriate, and trauma-informed manner by a specially trained child interviewer. Members of the multidisciplinary team that have jurisdiction over the case observe the interview as it is taking place. Interviews are recorded, reducing the number of times children need to be interviewed, therefore reducing trauma to the child. Information gathered in the forensic interview is used to help make decisions about protection, prosecution and treatment. Conducting forensic interviews with child crime victims in a child advocacy center is considered best practice.

History of child advocacy centers:
In 1985, Congressman Robert E. &quot;Bud&quot; Cramer (AL), who was then a District Attorney, organized an effort to create a better system to help abused children. He was frustrated as a prosecutor, because he was having difficulty prosecuting child abuse cases and getting guilty verdicts or pleas for offenders of crimes against children. He noticed the social service and the criminal justice systems were not working together in an effective manner and this created the common problem of adding to children&#x27;s emotional distress, and created a segmented, repetitious, and often frightening experience for the child victims. He pulled together law enforcement, criminal justice, child protective service, medical and mental health workers into one coordinated team that would serve child victims of crime in a respectful way. Thirty years ago, this was a revolutionary idea.

Child advocacy centers in the USA are accredited by the National Children&#x27;s Alliance.

The Child Advocate in the USA is a national not for profit organization with connections to hundreds of other organizations and resources to address sexual abuse but also many other advocacy needs for children and families. Their goals are to serve the needs of children, families and professionals while addressing mental health, medical, educational, legal and legislative issues.

Child advocacy organizations in the USA at the policy level exist at state and national levels and as transnational NGOs. The organizations that they work in vary from smaller organizations at the local level to multinational voluntary organizations concerned about international child rights.

== The United Nations ==

On the international stage, the United Nations has long advocated on behalf of children through UNICEF, whose position on children was formulated and publicly formalized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention sets out a summary of collective ideals and a covenant of commitments to all children on the planet.

== Philosophy ==

One thing that all child advocates have in common is healthy respect for young children. There is also recognition that in most countries, children are not seen as having full citizenship status which confers certain rights and responsibilities as adults. Child advocates provide assistance to children both in the foster care setting and children who are going through any court system. They provide the necessary counseling to the adults in child/children&#x27;s lives to ensure a high quality of life for the child. The most important person to the advocate is the child. The philosophy of a child advocate is to guarantee that the caretakers of any child are receiving the proper tools that are necessary for raising that child, guaranteeing a satisfactory life.

<doc id="1249646" wikidata="Q847097" url="?curid=1249646" title="Trespassers William">
<text>Trespassers William was an American indie rock band formed in 1997 from Orange County, California. The band released three albums from 1997 to 2006, relocating to the SoDo/Capitol Hill area of Seattle, Washington before their third album &quot;Having.&quot; Trespassers William disbanded in 2012, reuniting in 2020 for the release of a non-album single. 

The band underwent numerous lineup changes, never retaining the same roster for more than one album. Trespassers William most recently consisted of vocalist Anna-Lynne Williams and guitarist/keyboardist Matt Brown as a duo. Williams releases solo material under the moniker Lotte Kestner.

== History ==
Formed in Orange County, California in 1997, Trespassers William released four albums and two EPs. Their debut album &quot;Anchor&quot; (1999) appeared on Sonikwire Records and is now out of print. It features a more alternative country and dream pop sound. 

&quot;Different Stars&quot; was self-released in 2002 and was re-released twice—most recently on Nettwerk Records on October 19, 2004. The self-released version of &quot;Different Stars&quot; caught the attention of former Cocteau Twins member Simon Raymonde, who signed Trespassers William to his Bella Union record label.

In early 2004, the band moved to Seattle, leaving behind drummer Jamie Williams, who did not want to make the move with the band. Their third album, &quot;Having&quot;, (mixed by The Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann) was released on February 28, 2006. In February 2007, American webzine &quot;Somewhere Cold&quot; voted &quot;Having&quot; No. 10 on their &quot;2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame&quot;.

The band toured the United States and Europe several times, including a UK tour with Damien Rice and a festival appearance in Spain with Morrissey. The band&#x27;s music attracted modest press coverage and exposure, most notably in British magazines such as &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot; and was featured on such television shows as &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, and movies such as &quot;A Love Song for Bobby Long&quot; and &quot;Annapolis&quot;. Trespassers William also opened for The Chameleons lead singer Mark Burgess, Lisa Germano, Stereolab and James singer Tim Booth. Williams provided guest vocals for The Chemical Brothers&#x27; 2005 song &quot;Hold Tight London&quot; and Black Swan Lane&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Fakers&quot;.

Brown and Williams turned Trespassers William into a duo by 2009 as &quot;the constants in the history of the band.&quot; Williams would later admit that she felt the constant lineup changes &quot;weakened the band.&quot; After the release of &quot;The Natural Order of Things&quot; EP in 2009, the band entered a long period of silence and officially disbanded on January 1, 2012. Brown and Williams began writing music in their Seattle apartment, but Williams came down with a case of tendonitis which worsened the pair&#x27;s relationship. 

A collection of B-sides and rarities called &quot;Cast&quot;, which also contains an expanded edition of their 2009 EP &quot;The Natural Order of Things&quot;, was released by Saint Marie Records on September 4, 2012. In 2017, &quot;Newsweek&quot; named &quot;Cast&quot; the fifteenth best double album since Prince&#x27;s 1987 double album &quot;Sign o&#x27; The Times.&quot; Writing for &quot;Newsweek,&quot; Zach Schonfeld said that though &quot;Cast&quot; is &quot;technically a rarities compilation, but in all its weird aching melancholy, it has the ebb and flow of a proper album.&quot; 

In 2020, the band reunited to release the non-album single &quot;Winterstorms&quot;.

== Band name origin ==
Trespassers William&#x27;s name is from a Winnie-the-Pooh tale, &quot;Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle&quot; by A.A. Milne:
Next to [Piglet&#x27;s] house was a piece of broken board which had: &quot;TRESPASSERS WILL&quot; on it. When Christopher Robin asked Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather&#x27;s name, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one — Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.

== Influences ==
The band was influenced by The Smiths, Cocteau Twins, Red House Painters, Talk Talk, Sigur Rós, Kent, The Knife, Kate Bush and Radiohead.

<doc id="1249652" wikidata="Q152375" url="?curid=1249652" title="Djer">
<text>Djer (or Zer or Sekhty; ) is considered the third pharaoh of the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt in current Egyptology. He lived around the mid 31st century BC and reigned for c. 40 years. A mummified forearm of Djer or his wife was discovered by Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, but was discarded by Émile Brugsch.

== Name ==

The Abydos King List lists the third pharaoh as &quot;Iti&quot;, the Turin King List lists a damaged name, beginning with &quot;It...&quot;, while Manetho lists &quot;Kenkenês&quot;. Jürgen von Beckerath in the Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen (1999) translates the hieroglyphs of the name Djer as &quot;Defender of Horus.&quot;

== Length of reign ==
Although the Egyptian priest Manetho, writing in the third century BC, stated that Djer ruled for 57 years, modern research by Toby Wilkinson in &quot;Royal Annals of Ancient Egypt&quot; stresses that the near-contemporary and therefore, more accurate Palermo Stone ascribes Djer a reign of &quot;41 complete and partial years.&quot; Wilkinson notes that years 1–10 of Djer&#x27;s reign are preserved in register II of the Palermo Stone, while the middle years of this pharaoh&#x27;s reign are recorded in register II of Cairo stone fragment C1.
== Reign ==
Djer&#x27;s reign was preceded by a regency controlled by Neithhotep, possibly his mother or grandmother.

The evidence for Djer&#x27;s life and reign is:
* Tomb in Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab, Abydos
* Seal prints from graves 2185 and 3471 in Saqqara
* Inscriptions in graves 3503, 3506 and 3035 in Saqqara
* Seal impression and inscriptions from Helwan
* Jar from Turah with the name of Djer
* UC 16182 ivory tablet from Abydos, subsidiary tomb 612 of the enclosure of Djer
* UC 16172 copper adze with the name of Djer
* Inscription of his name (of questioned authenticity, however) at Wadi Halfa, Sudan

The inscriptions, on ivory and wood, are in a very early form of hieroglyphs, hindering complete translation, but a label at Saqqarah may depict the First Dynasty practice of human sacrifice. An ivory tablet from Abydos mentions that Djer visited Buto and Sais in the Nile Delta. One of his regnal years on the Cairo Stone was named &quot;Year of smiting the land of &quot;Setjet&quot;&quot;, which often is speculated to be Sinai or beyond.

Manetho claimed that Athothes, who is sometimes identified as Djer, had written a treatise on anatomy that still existed in his own day, over two millennia later.

== Family ==

Djer was a son of the pharaoh Hor-Aha and his wife Khenthap. His grandfather was probably Narmer. Djer fathered Merneith, wife of Djet and mother of Den. Women carrying titles later associated with queens such as &quot;Great One of the Hetes-Sceptre&quot; and &quot;She who Sees/Carries Horus&quot; were buried in subsidiary tombs near the tomb of Djer in Abydos or attested in Saqqara. These women are thought to be the wives of Djer and include:

* Nakhtneith (or Nekhetneith), buried in Abydos and known from a stela.
* Herneith, possibly a wife of Djer. Buried in Saqqara.
* Seshemetka, buried in Abydos next to the king. She was said to be a wife of Den in Dodson and Hilton.
* Penebui, her name and title were found on an ivory label from Saqqara.
* &quot;bsu&quot;, known from a label in Saqqara and several stone vessels (reading of name uncertain; name consists of three fish hieroglyphs).

== Tomb ==

Similarly to his father Hor-Aha, Djer was buried in Umm el-Qa&#x27;ab at Abydos. Djer&#x27;s tomb is tomb O of Petrie. His tomb contains the remains of 318 retainers who were buried with him. At some point, Djer&#x27;s tomb was devastated by fire, possibly as early as the Second Dynasty. During the Middle Kingdom, the tomb of Djer was revered as the tomb of Osiris, and the entire First Dynasty burial complex, which includes the tomb of Djer, was very important in the Egyptian religious tradition. An image of Osiris on a funerary bier was placed in the tomb, possibly by the Thirteenth dynasty pharaoh Djedkheperu.

Several objects were found in and around the tomb of Djer:

* A stela of Djer, now in the Cairo Museum, probably comes from Abydos.
* Labels mentioning the name of a palace and the name of Meritneith.
* Fragments of two vases inscribed with the name of Queen Neithhotep.
* Bracelets of a Queen were found in the wall of the tomb.

In the subsidiary tombs, excavators found objects including stelae representing several individuals, ivory objects inscribed with the name of Neithhotep, and various ivory tablets.

Manetho indicates that the First Dynasty ruled from Memphis – and indeed Herneith, one of Djer&#x27;s wives, was buried nearby at Saqqara.

<text>George Robert Urban (born Gyorgy Robert Ungar; 12 April 1921, in Miskolc, Hungary – 3 October 1997) was a Hungarian writer, best known as a broadcaster for Radio Free Europe (RFE).

==Early life==
Gyorgy Robert Ungar was born on 12 April 1921 in Miskolc, Hungary. He attended Budapest University and left Hungary for the United Kingdom in 1948, where he took up further studies at London University. On 1 April 1955 he was naturalised as a British subject under the name George Robert Urban.

==Career==
Urban began work for the BBC Hungarian service. He was a radio broadcaster for a number of years for the BBC World Service, leaving and joining RFE in 1960, and becoming its director for a period in the 1980s.

Urban is known also for his writing for &quot;Encounter&quot; magazine. His journalism and book writing drew heavily on long dialogues, in effect extended interviews, from his work at RFE, involving major intellectual and political figures who were prepared to engage with the Cold War. He also published a study of the Georgekreis, an early enthusiasm, and continuing shaper of his attitudes. In 1985, he signed a petition in support for the far-right paramilitary Contras (Nicaragua).

<text>Lieutenant General Clarence Ralph Huebner (November 24, 1888 – September 23, 1972) was a highly decorated senior officer of the United States Army who saw distinguished active service during both World War I and World War II. Perhaps his most notable role was as the Commanding General (CG) of the 1st Infantry Division (nicknamed &quot;The Big Red One&quot;) during the Normandy landings of World War II. From January 1945, through the end of World War II, Huebner commanded V Corps (United States).

==World War I==
A farm boy from Bushton, Kansas, who spent almost seven years serving from private to sergeant in the 18th Infantry Regiment, Huebner received a regular commission in November 1916.

During World War I Huebner served on the Western Front and was sent to France with his regiment, the 28th Infantry, which later became part of the 1st Infantry Division (&quot;The Big Red One&quot;), shortly after the American entry into World War I. The division was the first of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) to be sent overseas during the war. The following year he participated in the first American regimental assault at Cantigny, through Soissons, Saint-Mihiel, and the Meuse-Argonne. For his service in this war, he received two Distinguished Service Crosses, an Army Distinguished Service Medal, and a Silver Star. He commanded the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry at Cantigny after his commanding officer was killed, and later commanded the regiment, one of the youngest regimental commanders in the AEF.

Remaining in the army after the war, Huebner attended the United States Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1924 and served on its faculty from 1929 to 1933.

==World War II==
===Division command===
In 1943, Huebner relieved the popular commander of the 1st Infantry Division, General Terry Allen, in a move engineered by General Omar N. Bradley. While the 1st Infantry Division had enjoyed considerable combat success under Allen&#x27;s leadership, Bradley was highly critical of both Allen and assistant division commander Theodore Roosevelt Jr.&#x27;s wartime leadership style, which favored fighting ability over drill and discipline: &quot;While the Allies were parading decorously through Tunis,&quot; Bradley wrote, &quot;Allen&#x27;s brawling 1st Infantry Division was celebrating the Tunisian victory in a manner all its own. In towns from Tunisia all the way to Arzew, the division had left a trail of looted wine shops and outraged mayors. But it was in Oran...that the division really ran amuck. The trouble began when SOS (Services of Supply) troops, long stationed in Oran, closed their clubs and installations to our combat troops from the front. Irritated by this exclusion, the 1st Division swarmed into town to &#x27;liberate&#x27; it a second time.&quot; Despite this, Bradley admitted that &quot;none excelled the unpredictable Terry Allen in the leadership of troops.&quot;

Upon assuming command, Huebner immediately ordered a series of close-order drills, parades, and weapons instruction for the 1st Infantry Division, including its veterans, who had just finished a bloody series of engagements with German forces in Sicily. This did not endear him to the enlisted men of the division, who made no attempt to hide their preference for Allen. As one of the men of the Big Red One said in disgust, &quot;Hell&#x27;s bells! We&#x27;ve been killing Germans for months and now they are teaching us to shoot a rifle? It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot;

Supported by Bradley and Eisenhower, Huebner persisted, and the morale of the division gradually recovered. Huebner, aided by Brigadier General Willard G. Wyman, his assistant division commander, led the division in the assault on Omaha Beach on D-Day, followed by a successful infantry attack at Saint-Lô. The division would later repel a German counteroffensive at Mortain, and pursue the German Army across France, culminating in the Battles of Aachen and the Huertgen Forest.

===V Corps command===
In January 1945 Huebner took command of the V Corps, which he directed from the Rhine to the Elbe, where his troops made first contact with the Red Army. He commanded V Corps until November 11, 1945.

==Postwar service==
After World War II, Huebner served as Assistant Army Chief of Staff (G-3) at the Pentagon from late 1945 until 1946 when he became Chief of Staff for the United States European Command (EUCOM). He was promoted to lieutenant general on March 28, 1947, and also served as Deputy Commander in Chief of EUCOM from 1947 to 1950. He was the last Military Governor (acting) of the American Zone in Germany from May 15, 1949, to September 1, 1949.

Huebner retired from the army on November 30, 1950.

==Later years==
On September 1, 1951, Huebner became director of New York State&#x27;s Civil Defense Commission, a post he held until January 1961. A strong advocate of the building of fallout shelters, Huebner believed the United States population would eventually be forced to live full-time in underground shelters and &quot;would see the sunshine only by taking a calculated risk&quot;.

Huebner married Florence Barrett in 1921. Following her death in 1966, Huebner married Anna Imelda Mathews in 1968. She died in 1974. All three are buried together in Arlington National Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
Huebner was portrayed by Charles Macaulay in the 1980 film &quot;The Big Red One&quot;, in the opening sequence set in World War I and, in the reconstructed extended version, in 1944 just prior to the Battle of Huertgen Forest.

==Decorations==
Huebner received the following honors and awards during his military career:

<doc id="1249681" wikidata="Q455131" url="?curid=1249681" title="Eritrea national football team">
<text>The Eritrea national football team represents Eritrea in men&#x27;s international football and it is controlled by the Eritrean National Football Federation (ENFF). It is nicknamed the &quot;Red Sea Boys&quot;. It has never qualified for the finals of the FIFA World Cup or the Africa Cup of Nations. Asmara side Red Sea FC are the main supplier for the national team and the team represents both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF). Out of 211 national teams in the FIFA men&#x27;s team world rankings, they are the only one that is unranked.

==History==
An Eritrean team participated in a friendly tournament in Sudan in 1992, the year before Eritrea achieved independence. Eritrea participated in the 1994 CECAFA Cup, organised by the Council for East and Central Africa Football Association, even though the ENFF was not founded until 1996. The first full international was in the 1999 CECAFA Cup, the year after the ENFF joined the CAF and FIFA. They participated in the qualifying rounds of the 2000 African Cup of Nations and the 2002 World Cup, and subsequent editions until 2008. They have also appeared intermittently in the CECAFA Cup.

In the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Eritrea managed a scoreless home draw versus Cameroon and a 1–0 home win over Mozambique. They finished second in their three team group, and advanced to a playoff round where they faced Senegal and Zimbabwe, but ultimately lost all four matches in that final stage.

In the first round of the qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup, they were drawn against Nigeria, and were defeated 4–0 in the away leg, after a goalless draw at home. The coach was Yilmaz Yuceturk.

In the first round of the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Sudan was Eritrea&#x27;s first round opponent. Eritrea lost the first leg 3–0, before another goalless draw in Asmara. The coach was Eritrean Tekie Abraha.

In group 6 of the qualifiers for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, under the guidance of Romanian Dorian Marin, Eritrea finished second behind Angola, failing to qualify for the final tournament. They beat Kenya twice and drew at home to Angola.

In the first round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Eritrea faced Rwanda. The first leg in Asmara ended in a 1–1 draw (and saw Eritrea&#x27;s first ever goal in a World Cup qualification match), but Rwanda took the second leg by a score of 3–1.

In the first round of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, Eritrea faced Botswana. The first leg in Asmara saw Botswana win 2–0, and the second leg in Francistown saw Botswana win 3–1, with Botswana winning 5–1 on aggregate.

In the first round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Eritrea faced Namibia. The first leg in Asmara saw Namibia win 2–1, and the second leg saw Namibia win 2–0; Namibia won 4–1 on aggregate.

Eritrea withdrew from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

=== Withdrawals from major tournament qualifying ===
On 30 March 2014, Eritrea withdrew from the preliminary round of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, likely due to a rising number of the Eritrean national team players defecting from Eritrea during away matches. They were intended to play against South Sudan, who were awarded a walkover. 

On 2 March 2022, Eritrea withdrew from the preliminary round of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers due to the lack of a stadium that meets the requirements set by CAF to host its international matches. They were intended to play against Botswana. Botswana were also awarded a walkover.

In November 2023, Eritrea, who were drawn into Group E alongside Morocco, Zambia, Tanzania, Congo and Niger, pulled out of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, citing the reason as being the refusal of Zemede Tekle, who is the Eritrean Commissioner for Sports and Culture, to participate in the playoffs.

===Defections===
Recent years have seen a high number of refugees leaving Eritrea, and some athletes travelling to competitions abroad have taken the opportunity to abscond. In December 2012, 17 Eritrean footballers and the team&#x27;s doctor vanished after the CECAFA championship tournament in Uganda and all applied for asylum in the country.
Four players of Red Sea FC defected after a CAF Champions League 2006 match in Nairobi, Kenya, and up to 12 members of the national side after the 2007 CECAFA Cup in Tanzania. Another 6 players sought asylum in Angola in March 2007 after a group 6 qualifying game for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations. Three more players from the national team sought asylum in Sudan.

Eritrea withdrew from the 2008 CECAFA Cup, and from the common qualifying tournament shared by the 2010 World Cup and the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. Given the number of players seeking asylum, the Eritrean government began requiring athletes to pay a 100,000 nakfa surety before traveling abroad.

Eritrea returned to the 2009 CECAFA Cup in Nairobi. A young squad was assembled with just 12 days&#x27; training. In Group B, they gained a surprise draw with Zimbabwe, lost narrowly to Rwanda, and beat Somalia 3–1. They were easily beaten 4–0 in the quarter-finals by Tanzania. Twelve squad members failed to report for the return flight, and sought the assistance of the Refugee Consortium of Kenya. They were believed to be in hiding in Eastleigh, an eastern suburb of Nairobi home to many immigrants. Nicholas Musonye, the secretary-general of CECAFA, feared that the government might react by refusing to let the team travel abroad in future. The twelve players were later granted interim asylum by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kenya. Eleven of these players have since travelled to Adelaide in Australia with two of them, Samuel Ghebrehiwet and Ambes Sium, signing for Gold Coast United in the A-League in August 2011.

In the first round of the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, ten players from the Eritrean football team refused to return home after playing a World Cup qualifying match in Botswana and were granted asylum there.

In September 2019, four members of the national Under-20 team sought asylum in Uganda after the team qualified for the semi-finals of a competition. A few months later in December, a further seven players selected for the international team refused to return home and sought asylum in Uganda after a tournament. In October 2021, five footballers from the country&#x27;s under-20 women&#x27;s team also disappeared when on international duty in Uganda.

<text>Opéra comique (; plural: &quot;opéras comiques&quot;) is a genre of French opera that contains spoken dialogue and arias. It emerged from the popular &quot;opéras comiques en vaudevilles&quot; of the Fair Theatres of St Germain and St Laurent (and to a lesser extent the Comédie-Italienne), which combined existing popular tunes with spoken sections. Associated with the Paris theatre of the same name, &quot;opéra comique&quot; is not necessarily comical or shallow; &quot;Carmen&quot;, perhaps the most famous &quot;opéra comique&quot;, is a tragedy.

==Use of the term==

The term &quot;opéra comique&quot; is complex in meaning and cannot simply be translated as &quot;comic opera&quot;. The genre originated in the early 18th century with humorous and satirical plays performed at the theatres of the Paris fairs which contained songs (&quot;vaudevilles&quot;), with new words set to already existing music. The phrase &quot;opéra comique en vaudevilles&quot; or similar was often applied to these early-stage works. In the middle of the 18th century, composers began to write original music to replace the &quot;vaudevilles&quot;, under the influence of the lighter types of Italian opera (especially Giovanni Battista Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;). This form of &quot;opéra comique&quot; was often known as &quot;comédie mêlée d&#x27;ariettes&quot;, but the range of subject matter it covered expanded beyond the merely comic. By the 19th century, &quot;opéra comique&quot; often meant little more than works with spoken dialogue performed at the Opéra-Comique theatre, as opposed to works with recitative delivery which appeared at the Paris Opéra. Thus, probably the most famous of all &quot;opéras comiques&quot;, Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, is on a tragic subject. As Elizabeth Bartlet and Richard Langham Smith note in their &quot;Grove&quot; article on the subject, composers and librettists frequently rejected the use of the umbrella term &quot;opéra comique&quot; in favor of more precise labels.

==History==

===Beginnings===
&quot;Opéra comique&quot; began in the early eighteenth century in the theatres of the two annual Paris fairs, the Foire Saint Germain and the Foire Saint Laurent. Here plays began to include musical numbers called &quot;vaudevilles&quot;, which were existing popular tunes refitted with new words. The plays were humorous and often contained satirical attacks on the official theatres such as the Comédie-Française. In 1715 the two fair theatres were brought under the aegis of an institution called the Théâtre de l&#x27;Opéra-Comique. In spite of fierce opposition from rival theatres the venture flourished and leading playwrights of the time, including Alain-René Lesage and Alexis Piron, contributed works in the new form.

===Late 18th century===
The &quot;Querelle des Bouffons&quot; (1752–54), a quarrel between advocates of French and Italian music, was a major turning-point for &quot;opéra comique&quot;. Members of the pro-Italian faction, such as the philosopher and musician Jean-Jacques Rousseau, attacked serious French opera, represented by the &quot;tragédies en musique&quot; of Jean-Philippe Rameau, in favor of what they saw as the simplicity and &quot;naturalness&quot; of Italian comic opera (opera buffa), exemplified by Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;, which had recently been performed in Paris by a traveling Italian troupe. In 1752, Rousseau produced a short opera influenced by Pergolesi, &quot;Le Devin du village&quot;, in an attempt to introduce his ideas of musical simplicity and naturalness to France. Its success attracted the attention of the Foire theatres. The next year, the head of the Saint Laurent theatre, Jean Monnet, commissioned the composer Antoine Dauvergne to produce a French opera in the style of &quot;La serva padrona&quot;. The result was &quot;Les troqueurs&quot;, which Monnet passed off as the work of an Italian composer living in Vienna who was fluent in French, thus fooling the partisans of Italian music into giving it a warm welcome. Dauvergne&#x27;s opera, with a simple plot, everyday characters, and Italianate melodies, had a huge influence on subsequent &quot;opéra comique&quot;, setting a fashion for composing new music, rather than recycling old tunes. Where it differed from later &quot;opéras comiques&quot;, however, was that it contained no spoken dialogue. In this, Dauvergne was following the example of Pergolesi&#x27;s &quot;La serva padrona&quot;.
The short, catchy melodies which replaced the &quot;vaudevilles&quot; were known as &quot;ariettes&quot; and many &quot;opéras comiques&quot; in the late 18th century were styled &quot;comédies mêlées d&#x27;ariettes&quot;. Their librettists were often playwrights, skilled at keeping up with the latest trends in the theatre. Louis Anseaume, Michel-Jean Sedaine and Charles Simon Favart were among the most famous of these dramatists. Notable composers of &quot;opéras comiques&quot; in the 1750s and 1760s include Egidio Duni, Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny and François-André Danican Philidor. Duni, an Italian working at the francophile court of Parma, composed &quot;Le peintre amoureux de son modèle&quot; in 1757 with a libretto by Anseaume. Its success encouraged the composer to move to Paris permanently and he wrote 20 or so more works for the French stage. Monsigny collaborated with Sedaine in works which mixed comedy with a serious social and political element. &quot;Le roi et le fermier&quot; (1762) contains Enlightenment themes such as the virtues of the common people and the need for liberty and equality. Their biggest success, &quot;Le déserteur&quot; (1769), concerns the story of a soldier who has been condemned to death for deserting the army. Philidor&#x27;s most famous &quot;opéra comique&quot; was &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1765), based on Henry Fielding&#x27;s 1749 novel of the same name. It is notable for its realistic characters and its many ensembles.

The most important and popular composer of &quot;opéra comique&quot; in the late 18th century was André Grétry. Grétry successfully blended Italian tunefulness with a careful setting of the French language. He was a versatile composer who expanded the range of &quot;opéra comique&quot; to cover a wide variety of subjects from the Oriental fairy tale &quot;Zémire et Azor&quot; (1772) to the musical satire of &quot;Le jugement de Midas&quot; (1778) and the domestic farce of (also 1778). His most famous work was the historical &quot;rescue opera&quot;, &quot;Richard Coeur-de-lion&quot; (1784), which achieved international popularity, reaching London in 1786 and Boston in 1797.

Between 1724 and 1762 the Opéra-Comique theatre was located at the Foire Saint Germain. In 1762 the company was merged with the Comédie-Italienne and moved to the Hôtel de Bourgogne. In 1783 a new, larger home was created for it at the Théâtre Italien (later renamed the Salle Favart).

===Revolution and the 19th century===

The French Revolution brought many changes to musical life in Paris. In 1793, the name of the Comédie-Italienne was changed to the Opéra-Comique, but it no longer had a monopoly on performing operas with spoken dialogue and faced serious rivalry from the Théâtre Feydeau, which also produced works in the &quot;opéra comique&quot; style. &quot;Opéra comique&quot; generally became more dramatic and less comic and began to show the influence of musical Romanticism. The chief composers at the Opéra-Comique during the Revolutionary era were Étienne Méhul, Nicolas Dalayrac, Rodolphe Kreutzer and Henri-Montan Berton. Those at the Feydeau included Luigi Cherubini, Pierre Gaveaux, Jean-François Le Sueur and François Devienne. The works of Méhul (for example &quot;Stratonice&quot;, 1792; &quot;Ariodant&quot;, 1799), Cherubini (&quot;Lodoïska&quot;, 1791; &quot;Médée&quot;, 1797; &quot;Les Deux journées&quot;, 1800) and Le Sueur (&quot;La caverne&quot;, 1793) in particular show the influence of serious French opera, especially Gluck, and a willingness to take on previously taboo subjects (e.g. incest in Méhul&#x27;s &quot;Mélidore et Phrosine&quot;, 1794; infanticide in Cherubini&#x27;s famous &quot;Médée&quot;). Orchestration and harmony are more complex than in the music of the previous generation; attempts are made to reduce the amount of spoken dialogue, and unity is provided by techniques such as the &quot;reminiscence motif&quot; (recurring musical themes representing a character or idea).

In 1801 the Opéra-Comique and the Feydeau merged for financial reasons. The changing political climate – more stable under the rule of Napoleon – was reflected in musical fashion as comedy began to creep back into &quot;opéra-comique&quot;. The lighter new offerings of Boieldieu (such as &quot;Le calife de Bagdad&quot;, 1800) and Isouard (&quot;Cendrillon&quot;, 1810) were a great success. Parisian audiences of the time also loved Italian opera, visiting the Théâtre Italien to see &quot;opera buffa&quot; and works in the newly fashionable bel canto style, especially those by Rossini, whose fame was sweeping across Europe. Rossini&#x27;s influence began to pervade French &quot;opéra comique&quot;. Its presence is felt in Boieldieu&#x27;s greatest success, &quot;La dame blanche&quot; (1825) as well as later works by Auber (&quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, 1830; &quot;Le domino noir&quot;, 1837), Ferdinand Hérold (&quot;Zampa&quot;, 1831), and Adolphe Adam (&quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot;, 1836).

<text>Verney Lovett Cameron (1 July 184424 March 1894) was an English traveller in Central Africa and the first European to cross (1875) equatorial Africa from sea to sea.

==Biography==
He was born at Radipole, near Weymouth, Dorset, son of Rev Jonathan Lovett Cameron and Frances Sapte. He entered the Royal Navy in 1857, served in the Abyssinian campaign of 1868, and was employed for a considerable time in the suppression of the East African slave trade.

The experience thus obtained led to his being selected to command an expedition sent by the Royal Geographical Society in 1873, to assist Dr Livingstone. He was also instructed to make independent explorations, guided by Livingstone&#x27;s advice. Soon after the departure of the expedition from Zanzibar, a caravan of about 80 led by Chuma and Susi were met bearing the dead body of the reverend doctor. Cameron&#x27;s two European companions, Dr William Edward Dillon, surgeon in the Royal Navy, and Lieutenant Cecil Murphy of the Royal Artillery, turned back to join the task of returning Livingstone&#x27;s body to the coast. Cameron continued his march and reached Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika, in February 1874, where he found and sent to England Livingstone&#x27;s papers.

Cameron spent some time determining the true form of the southern part of the lake, and solved the question of its outlet by the discovery of the Lukuga River. From Tanganyika he struck westward to Nyangwe, the Arab town on the Lualaba previously visited by Livingstone. This river Cameron rightly believed to be the main stream of the Congo, and he endeavoured to procure canoes to follow it down. In this he was unsuccessful, owing to his refusal to countenance slavery, and he, therefore, turned southwest. After tracing the Congo-Zambezi watershed for hundreds of miles he reached Bihe and finally arrived at the coast on 28 November 1875, being the first European to cross equatorial Africa from sea to sea. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1876.

His travels, which were published in 1877 under the title &quot;Across Africa&quot;, contain valuable suggestions for the opening up of the continent, including the utilization of the great lakes as a Cape to Cairo Road connection. In recognition of his work, he was promoted to the rank of Commander.

The remainder of Cameron&#x27;s life was chiefly devoted to projects for the commercial development of Africa, and to editing and writing. His last work was the editing of the personal adventure narrative of the Master Mariner James Choyce, who had sailed as a teenager in 1797 aboard a whaler to the Pacific Ocean. Choyce&#x27;s narrative covering 26 years of seafaring life is one of the earliest works of an Englishman&#x27;s experiences in South America.

Cameron in 1878–1879 visited the Euphrates valley in connection with a proposed railway to the Persian Gulf, and accompanied Sir Richard Burton in his West African journey of 1882. At the Gold Coast Cameron surveyed the Tarkwa region, and he was joint author with Burton of &quot;To the Gold Coast for Gold&quot; (1883). In the 1880s he published several books for boys emulating his sister-in-law Mrs. Lovett Cameron who wrote romantic fiction.

He was killed, near Leighton Buzzard, by a fall from horseback when returning from hunting in 1894. He had married Amy, the daughter of William Morris of Jamaica.

A second edition of &quot;Across Africa&quot;, with new matter and corrected maps, appeared in 1885. A summary of Cameron&#x27;s great journey, from his own pen, appears in Dr Robert Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Africa&quot;, vol. II, pp. 266–279 (London, 1893).

&quot;Across Africa&quot; was republished in 2005.

<doc id="1249689" wikidata="Q5150525" url="?curid=1249689" title="Comanche Wars">
<text>The Comanche Wars were a series of armed conflicts fought between Comanche peoples and Spanish, Mexican, and American militaries and civilians in the United States and Mexico from as early as 1706 until at least the mid-1870s. The Comanche were the Native American inhabitants of a large area known as Comancheria, which stretched across much of the southern Great Plains from Colorado and Kansas in the north through Oklahoma, Texas, and eastern New Mexico and into the Mexican state of Chihuahua in the south. For more than 150 years, the Comanche were the dominant native tribe in the region, known as “the Lords of the Southern Plains”, though they also shared parts of Comancheria with the Wichita, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache and, after 1840, the southern Cheyenne and Arapaho.

The value of the Comanche traditional homeland was recognized by European-American colonists seeking to settle the American frontier and quickly brought the two sides into conflict. The Comanche Wars began in 1706 with raids by Comanche warriors on the Spanish colonies of New Spain and continued until the last bands of Comanche surrendered to the United States Army in 1875, although a few Comanche continued to fight in later conflicts such as the Buffalo Hunters&#x27; War in 1876 and 1877. The Comanche were noted as fierce combatants who practiced an emphatic resistance to European-American influence and upon their lands.

Comanche power peaked in the 1840s when they conducted large-scale raids hundreds of miles into Mexico proper, while also warring against the Anglo-Americans and Tejanos who had settled in independent Texas. Their power declined as epidemics of cholera and smallpox caused thousands of Comanche deaths and as continuous pressure from the expanding population of the United States forced them to cede most of their tribal lands.

==Influential people==

===Iron Jacket===
Iron Jacket was a Comanche chief and medicine man. The name “Iron Jacket” came from his tendency to wear a coat of mail into battle. Iron Jacket took part in the Antelope Hills Expedition of 1858, where he was ultimately killed at the Battle of Little Robe Creek. His son, Peta Nocona, became a chief himself.

===Peta Nocona===
Peta Nocona was the father of the last Comanche Chief Quanah Parker, as well as a Comanche Chief who played a crucial part in the Indian Wars. Peta Nocona led the full attack on Fort Parker where Cynthia Ann Parker was taken captive and later became his wife. Peta Nocona&#x27;s place and date of death is still in dispute.

===Quanah Parker===

Quanah Parker was the last Comanche Chief and part of the Quahadi sect of the Comanche, who were highly respected by the other tribes. Quanah was never an official chief since the United States government appointed him to the position. Before he was a Comanche chief, Quanah Parker witnessed the peace negotiations of 1867 but refused to sign the accords.

===Buffalo Hump===
Buffalo Hump was a Comanche War Chief who led the Great Raid of 1840 after Texan officials killed Comanche delegates during the events that unfolded during the Council House Fight.

===Mirabeau B. Lamar===
Mirabeau Lamar was the second President of the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1841, preceded by Sam Houston. Mirabeau Lamar had a harsher policy towards Native Americans in Texas and signed two bills which escalated tensions in the region. The first bill was signed on December 21, 1838, which formed an 840-man regiment to protect the Northern and Western Frontiers of Texas. An additional bill was passed on December 29, 1838, which added an additional 8 companies of mounted volunteers to serve 6 month deployments.

===Santa Anna (Comanche war chief)===
Santa Anna was a Comanche war chief who advocated for armed resistance against the Texas settlers, and became influential after the Council House Fight of 1840 in San Antonio. Santa Anna joined forces with Buffalo Hump and most likely took part in the Battle of Plum Creek and the Great Raid of 1840. Santa Anna was the first of his tribe to travel to Washington, D.C., and agreed to sign a treaty in May 1846, despite the continued hostilities. Santa Anna died from a cholera outbreak in 1849.

==Battles and campaigns in the United States==

===Fort Parker massacre (May 1836)===
The Fort Parker massacre was a raid conducted by a coalition of tribes including the Comanches, Kiowas, Caddos and Wichitas. They attacked the fort killing five of the inhabitants and capturing Cynthia Ann Parker a nine-year old who later married the Comanche chief Peta Nocona, John Richard Parker the brother of Cynthia Ann Parker, Rachel Plummer a seventeen-year-old wife along with her son James Pratt Plummer, and lastly Elizabeth Duty Kellog who was later reunited with her sister Martha in 1836.

===Council House Fight (March 1840)===
The Council House Fight was a Peace delegation turned conflict between the Comanche delegates and the Texas officials on March 19, 1840. The conflict started over negotiations regarding Texan and Mexican captives that the Comanches were holding in order to gain back sections of Comancheria that Texas had claimed. The Council house fight ended with twelve of the Comanche Leaders killed inside the Council house as well as 23 others shot in San Antonio.

===Battle of Plum Creek (August 1840)===
The Battle of Plum Creek was a conflict in Lockhart, Texas that took place on August 12, 1840. It was an attack led by Chief Buffalo Hump who led a large force of 1,000 Comanche warriors against 200 Texas Rangers in response to the Council House Fight. The Battle Began as a raid where the Comanche party stole livestock and firearms which gradually turned into a gun fight. The results of the battle are still being debated since the Rangers reported 80 Comanches were killed but only 12 bodies were found The Comanches claimed to have killed 11 Texas Rangers.

===Antelope Hills expedition (January–May 1858)===
The Antelope Hills expedition was a campaign led by the federal 2nd Cavalry against the Comanche and Kiowa tribes in Comancheria. It started in January 1858 and ended in May of the same year. The cause for the expedition was due to Comanche raids into Texan territories. Peta Nocona and Iron Jacket led Comanche troops against the combined 220 forces of the 2nd cavalry, Tonkawa, Nadaco and Shawnee. Their expedition&#x27;s purpose was to move the 2nd Cavalry from Oklahoma to Texas in order to better handle the raiding Comanches. For this reason the United States gained the aid of the Comanches&#x27; enemy tribes Tonkawa, Nadaco and Shawnee. The resulting battle concluded with 50 killed on the United States side and 76 killed and 16 captured on the Comanche side. The Antelope Hills Expedition further expanded into the Battle of Little Robe Creek.

====Battle of Little Robe Creek====
The 1858 Battle of Little Robe Creek (Also known as the Battle of Antelope Hills) was a battle fought between the Comanches&#x27; allies of the Kiowa and the Apache against the Texas Rangers with their allies the Tonkawa, Caddo, Anadarko, Waco, Shawnee, Delaware, and Tahaucano. The Battle was the first in which the Texas Rangers successfully advanced into Comancheria. The United States rallied a force of 100 Texas Rangers and 113 allies where the Comanches rallied a force between the range of 200-600. The &quot;battle&quot; itself was actually three decisive engagements between the Comanches and the Texas Rangers; the first began in the morning of May 12 when the Rangers, led by General Ford launched a surprise attack on a Comanche camp. The Comanches were caught completely off guard and a massacre occurred. The second battle began when the Texas Rangers attempted to do the same to another nearby Comanche encampment. As they encroached on the camp, the Rangers were spotted by Comanche scouts. Though able to mount a concerted defense this time, the Comanche still suffered heavy casualties. It was not until the third and final battle of Little Robe creek that Comanche warriors were able to take an offensive stance against the Texas Rangers who then withdrew back into Texas proper. However, the campaign was costly for the Comanche forces: with 76 killed and over 60 warriors captured by the Texas Rangers, who by comparison lost only two killed and five wounded.

===Battle of Pease River (December 1860)===
The Battle of Pease River took place on December 18, 1860, in Foard County, Texas. This battle has become highly debated due to unreliable sources and exaggerated facts surrounding the event, but the event started in November 1860, most likely when a band of Comanche warriors, &quot;struck farms, ranches, and outlying settlements in Parker, Young, Jack, and Palo Pinto counties west of Fort Worth.&quot; In these Comanche raids property was stolen and at least six people were killed. The citizens responded by pursuing the Comanches to a village on the Pease River, but because there were too many Comanches, the citizens had to wait for a larger force to arrive. Three units arrived, led by Lawrence Sullivan &quot;Sul&quot; Ross, Captain J.J. Cureton, and First Sergeant John W. Spangler. On December 19, 1860, Sul Ross led the attack on the Comanche village and according to Ross&#x27;s report, &quot;killed twelve of the Comanches and captured three: a woman who turned out to be Cynthia Ann Parker, her daughter Topsannah (Prairie Flower), and a young boy whom Ross brought to Waco and named Pease Ross...The whole incident lasted twenty minutes-thirty at the most.&quot;

===First Battle of Adobe Walls (November 1864)===
The First Battle of Adobe Walls was a battle fought against the United States Army and the Comanche Allies of Kiowa, and the Plains Apaches. The battle began when Kit Carson attacked a Kiowa town In response the Kiowa and Comanches launched a counterattack of over 1,000 men. The battle was long and drawn out almost to the point of the United States army running out of ammunition.

=== Red River War (June- September 1874) ===
In 1874 what came to be known as the Red River War (or Buffalo War) began. With the total population of the Comanche tribe reduced to only around 3,000 in total, divisions began to appear within the tribe. About two-thirds of the remaining Comanche now resided on the reservation, often labeled the “tamed Comanche” or “broken Comanche”. About 1,000 Comanche however continuing to roam the plains. Most of these Comanche would be considered civilians with only about 300 being actual warriors. The unsettled Comanche joined forces with warriors from likeminded factions of Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, and Southern Cheyenne and gathered together in the North Texas panhandle near the four major forks of Red River. The federal government responded by sending forty-six companies of soldiers, the largest force ever deployed against Native Americans by the U.S., under the command of General Mackenzie. The majority of the Red River War was conducted in guerrilla warfare and search-and-destroy tactics. The conflict ended with the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon, when General Mackenzie was able to conduct a surprise attack on the Comanche settlement. This led to the destruction of most of the Comanche’s resources and the seizure of 1,424 horses.

<text>PNS &quot;Tariq&quot; (DDG-181) was the lead ship of the s in the Surface Command of the Pakistan Navy that served in the military service from 1993 until 2023. Prior to being commissioned in the Pakistan Navy, she served in the Royal Navy, as general purpose frigate .

Designed and constructed by Yarrow Shipbuilders, Ltd. at Glasgow, Scotland, in 1975, she underwent an extensive modernization and mid-life upgrade program by the KSEW Ltd. at the Naval Base Karachi in 1998–2002.

&quot;Tariq&quot; was decommissioned on 6 August 2023, alongside plans to return her to the United Kingdom for conversion to a museum ship.

==Service history==
===Acquisition, construction, and modernization===

Before commissioning in the Pakistan Navy, she served in the Royal Navy as , saw active military operations during the United Kingdom&#x27;s Falklands War with Argentina in 1980s. She was lead ship based on the Type 21/&quot;Amazon&quot; design and was constructed by the Yarrow Shipbuilders, Ltd. in Glasgow in Scotland in 1973–75.

After the successful negotiations took place between Pakistan and the United Kingdom to procure the entire fleet of Type 21/&quot;Amazon&quot; frigates, she was decommissioned by the Royal Navy and a contingent of Pakistan Navy&#x27;s personnel under Commander Muhammad Anwar arrived to receive training of her operations. She was commissioned in the services of Pakistan Navy on 28 July 1993 at the Port of Plymouth in England, reporting to its Naval Base Karachi on 18 November 1993.

She was named after Tariq ibn Ziyad, the commander who led the Umayyad conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711–718 A.D. She was sponsored by the Benazir Bhutto, who as a chief guest and then-Prime Minister serving at that time.

The Royal Navy did not transfer either the Exocet and Seacat missiles, which were removed prior to arriving at Karachi but the Westland Lynx helicopters remained with the ship. The modernization of the ship was performed by KSEW Ltd which later installed the Phalanx system in place of the Seacat missiles as well as the Mk. 36 SRBOC launchers and 20 mm and 30 mm guns were fitted.

===Deployment===
Her wartime performance included in deployments in patrolling off the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea as well as deploying in the Mediterranean Sea when she was part of the multinational military exercise with the U.S. Navy in 2005.

After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, &quot;Tariq&quot; was deployed on a search-and-rescue mission to the Maldives, where she rescued 377 tourists.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
On 6 August 2023, after 30 years service, &quot;Tariq&quot; was decommissioned in the presence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the ship&#x27;s original sponsor, Benazir Bhutto.

The Pakistan Navy has responded positively to proposals to return the Falklands veteran to the UK to become a museum ship near her birthplace on the River Clyde, at Glasgow or Greenock.

<text>The FM and TV mast Katowice / Kosztowy (RTCN Katowice / Kosztowy) is a 358,7 metre tall guyed mast for FM and TV situated at Mysłowice - near Kosztowy, Poland. It replaced the TVP Katowice Mast which was dismantled in the 1970s.

The TVP Katowice Mast which it replaced was a 225-metre-high guyed steel framework mast with a triangular cross-section near Katowice, Poland. It was not the transmission site for the medium-wave frequency 1080 kHz. This frequency is transmitted by the transmitter Koszęcin.

The FM and TV mast Katowice / Kosztowy is since the collapse of the Warsaw radio mast the tallest structure in Poland. It was inaugurated on June 23, 1976. Originally its height was 269 metres. In 1987 it was converted to its actual value.

During rush hour, the section between Xizhimen and Wudaokou Stations was reported in 2013 to be the second most congested section in the Beijing subway network, operating at 130% capacity.

==Fare==

There is a starting fare of RMB(¥) 3.00 that increases according to the distance, a fare scheme introduced in December 2014. 

Regular subway users can use a Yikatong card, which offers even cheaper journeys, as well as mobile phone apps, which deploy payments via a QR code.

==Hours of operation==

The first trains depart from and at 5:35am. The last trains to go the full-distance and reach the other terminus depart from Xizhimen and Dongzhimen at 10:42pm. In addition, Line 13 offers later night trains from either terminus that travel half of the full route. The last train to leave Xizhimen, departs at 11:45pm and ends its journey at Huilongguan at 12:09am. The last train to leave Dongzhimen, departs at 11:45pm and ends its journey at Huoying at 12:09am. For the official timetable, see. The frequency of trains on Line 13 varies from 3.5 minutes per train during the morning rush hour (6:20am – 9:40am) to 5 minutes per train during the evening rush hour (4:40pm – 8:40pm) to 10-11.5 minutes per train after 10:50pm. For a full listing of train frequency, see.

==Route==
Line 13&#x27;s route is shaped like a horseshoe over northern Beijing. From in Xicheng District, Line 13 heads north, running alongside the Beijing-Baotou Railway into Haidian. After three stops in the bustling university district -- , (transfer to Line 10), and —Line 13 leaves the 5th Ring Road and enters the suburbs of northern Haidian. At , Line 13 meets the Changping Line, and turns east, following the southern edge of Changping District for three stops (, , and ), before turning to the southeast. It enters Chaoyang District at (transfer to Line 5) and curls southwest after onto the Beijing-Chengde Expressway. At , Line 13 intersects with Line 15. After entering the 3rd Ring Road at , the line runs straight south, along the remnants of the eastern earthen wall to Liufang. Then, Line 13 goes underground to in Dongcheng District where transfers are available to Line 2 and the Capital Airport Express.

==Stations (from West to East)==

From Xizhimen to Dongzhimen, line 13 was having station numbers from 1301 to 1316, except the Qinghe Railway Station, these numbers were cancelled in 2022.

==History==
Line 13 was opened in two sections: The western section between Xizhimen and Huoying was opened on September 28, 2002; the eastern section from Huoying to Dongzhimen was opened on January 28, 2003. Despite being numbered 13, the line was only the third subway line to enter into operation as lines 3 to 12 were still under planning at line 13&#x27;s opening. It was the first Beijing Subway line to adopt &quot;Yikatong&quot;, the electronic farecard, at the end of 2003.

==Future development==
On November 22, 2018, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Planning and Natural Resources began the 30-day public consultation of a plan to split Line 13 into two lines, temporarily named Line 13A and Line 13B. According to the plan, the existing Line 13 will be split between Xi&#x27;erqi station and Huilongguan station, to form two L-shaped lines intersecting in the north of the city. Passengers can use a cross-platform interchange between Line 13A and Line 13B at a new station in the west of the Jingzang Expressway.

===Line 13A===
Line 13A has a total length of with 18 stations, including of new line and 13 new stations. The line will be built to support expanded 8-car Type B trains.
===Line 13B===

Line 13B has a total length of with 15 stations, including of new line and 6 new stations. The line will continue to use 6-car Type B trains.

<text>Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship (UCCF; also UCCF: The Christian Unions) is an evangelical Christian student movement with affiliate groups on university campuses in the United Kingdom. It is a member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. The UCCF endorses a conservative evangelical form of Christian theology.

The Christian Unions provide opportunities for fellowship, bible study and evangelism, with nearly 40,000 students attending outreach events each year.

==History==
The Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship was formally established in 1928 as the Inter Varsity Fellowship, having emerged informally as a body influenced by the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union earlier in the 1920s. CICCU had split from the broader Student Christian Movement (SCM) in 1910, following tensions between the two throughout the first decade of the 1900s. With a stronger conservative and evangelical presence than other Christian Unions, CICCU disagreed with SCM&#x27;s move towards interdenominationalism and modernism (including the endorsement of newly emerging methods of Biblical criticism) and wanted a greater emphasis to be put on evangelism. An attempted reconciliation between the two groups in 1919 was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to CICCU&#x27;s insistence on the centrality of the atonement for Christian faith, which SCM would not agree to. Evangelical students in the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union subsequently seceded from the SCM and, following a two-year reaffiliation, permanently left the SCM in 1927.

From 1919, under the influence of Norman Grubb, conservative evangelical students from UK universities began meeting at an annual conference in London. The first meeting produced a declaration critical of the Student Christian Movement, in particular criticizing its basis of faith for not mentioning the divinity of Christ and omitting any mention of sin, forgiveness, and salvation. In 1922, at the fourth annual meeting, it was decided to formally make the conference an annual event, as well as to appoint an executive committee and draft a constitution. The constitution of the Inter-Varsity Conference, which was accepted in 1923, included the group&#x27;s doctrinal basis. The 1923 doctrinal basis included the &quot;divine inspiration and infallibility of Scripture&quot;, the &quot;universal sinfulness and guilt of human nature&quot;, and the &quot;redemption from guilt, penalty and power of sin only through the sacrificial death... of Jesus Christ&quot;. Anyone who wanted to hold an official position in the running of the conferences had to sign the basis of faith, a requirement was created for prospective speakers to hold views in accordance with the basis, and the conference was prohibited from undertaking joint activities with groups that did not doctrinally align with the conference.

By 1928, the Inter-Varsity Conference became a permanent fellowship of evangelical Christian Unions and rival organisation to the SCM. After becoming the secretary of the Inter-Varsity Conference in 1924, King&#x27;s College alumnus Douglas Johnson was chosen as the first and founding General Secretary of the Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions by delegates of the 1928 conference. He remained in this role until 1964.

In 1947 the Inter-Varsity Fellowship became a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES). The movement developed out of links that had been established between the IVF and the Norwegian network of Christian Unions, the &quot;Norges Kristelige Studentlag&quot;. From 1934, regular international conferences took place between evangelicals connected to universities in Europe, North America, South Africa, and Australia; in 1947 the IFES was formally established. In 1997, UCCF-affiliated Christian Unions at universities on the island of Ireland formed an independent movement called IFES Ireland (later renamed Christian Unions Ireland).

Owing to the increasing number of IVF-affiliated Christian Unions in non-university colleges, the Inter-Varsity Fellowship changed its name to the Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship in 1974.

Until 2007 UCCF continued to act as the umbrella organization for Christian Unions in institutions within both the higher education and further education sectors. In that year, UCCF, in co-operation with Scripture Union, launched Festive, an independent initiative focused on supporting Christian Union groups in further education and sixth form colleges.

===Key staff===
* Douglas Johnson, Secretary, 1928–64
* Oliver R. Barclay, General Secretary, 1964–80
* Robin Wells, General Secretary, 1980–92
* Richard Cunningham, Director, 2004–2024
* Matt Lillicrap, Chief Executive Officer, 2024-

===Research===
UCCF supports biblical research through Tyndale House, Cambridge, which opened in 1945 and became independent in 2015.

From the late 1980s and into this century, support for those involved in Christian ethics was provided through the Whitefield Institute, Oxford, founded by E. David Cook. In 2006, this was reconstituted to become the Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics, now the Kirby Laing Centre for Public Theology.

==Theology==
UCCF endorses a conservative evangelical form of Christian theology. Its doctrinal basis reflects typical elements of conservative evangelicalism, such as Biblical infallibility, the universal sinfulness of all humans, and penal substitution. Individual Christian Unions must subscribe to UCCF&#x27;s doctrinal basis in order to be affiliated with them, and anyone who occupies a leadership position (including student executive committee members) or speaks at a Christian Union event must also sign to affirm their agreement.

The explicitly conservative evangelicalism of UCCF&#x27;s doctrinal basis has led some to criticise the exclusivity of UCCF&#x27;s theology. Biblical infallibility, the view that the Bible is completely true and sufficient for Christian belief and practice, is rejected by many Christian denominations. The doctrine of penal substitution is likewise rejected by many non-evangelical Christians. In some cases, UCCF&#x27;s evangelical theology has led to Christian Unions having difficult relationships with chaplaincies and/or student unions. It is also a substantial and persistent difference between UCCF and SCM (which is committed to ecumenism, including co-operation with CUs).

==Demographics and organisation==
According to a 2013 research paper, there are approximately 200 UCCF-affiliated Christian Unions in the UK, with a total membership of around 10,000. UCCF members thus accounted for just over 1% of the total Christian student population in the UK (800,000). In the same survey, 10% of Christian students (over 82,000) reported engaging with Christian Union activities during term time.

UCCF employs about 80 staff, and has a further 80 or so volunteer &quot;Relay Workers&quot; on a one-year training programme. Many of these staff and volunteers are graduates who were involved in the CU as undergraduates. They support the student Christian Unions with training, advice and materials. According to a 2006 &quot;Ekklesia&quot; report, the majority (&gt;65%) of UCCF&#x27;s funding comes through donations by individuals. A further 10% of its funding is from donations by churches, while the rest is made up of contributions made by individual Christian Unions groups and support from charitable trusts.

<text>IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio (often informally referred to simply as CPLEX) is an optimization software package.

== History ==
The CPLEX Optimizer was named after the simplex method implemented in the C programming language. However, today it also supports other types of mathematical optimization and offers interfaces other than C. It was originally developed by Robert E. Bixby and sold commercially in 1988 by CPLEX Optimization Inc. This was acquired by ILOG in 1997 and ILOG was subsequently acquired by IBM in January 2009. CPLEX continues to be actively developed by IBM.

== Features ==
The IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer solves integer programming problems, very large linear programming problems using either primal or dual variants of the simplex method or the barrier interior point method, convex and non-convex quadratic programming problems, and convex quadratically constrained problems (solved via second-order cone programming, or SOCP).

The CPLEX Optimizer has a modeling layer called Concert that provides interfaces to the C++, C#, and Java languages. There is a Python language interface based on the C interface. Finally, a stand-alone Interactive Optimizer executable is provided for debugging and other purposes.

The CPLEX Optimizer is accessible through independent modeling systems such as AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, OptimJ and TOMLAB. In addition to that AMPL provides an interface to the CPLEX CP Optimizer.

The full IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio consists of the CPLEX Optimizer for mathematical programming, the CP Optimizer for constraint programming, the Optimization Programming Language (OPL), and a tightly integrated IDE.

== Release history ==
Prior to IBM acquiring ILOG, the CPLEX team published a release history of CPLEX.

<text>Perihelion Software Limited was a United Kingdom company founded in 1986 by Dr. Tim King along with a number of colleagues who had all worked together at MetaComCo on AmigaOS and written compilers for both the Amiga and the Atari ST.

Perihelion Software produced an operating system for the INMOS Transputer called HeliOS. This was a system that looked like Unix but which could pass messages to processes running on either the same processor or another one. This was used in the Atari Transputer Workstation, among other places.

Later HeliOS was ported to other processors including the ARM architecture.

Perihelion Software also produced an in-memory database system called Polyhedra. The group responsible for this product was set up as a subsidiary, Perihelion Technology Limited (PTL), which did a management buyout in 1994. PTL later changed its name to Polyhedra plc in 1995, and in 2001 was acquired by a Swedish company called ENEA.

<text>Geosiris is a genus in the flowering plant family Iridaceae, first described in 1894. It was thought for many years to contain only one species, &quot;Geosiris aphylla&quot;, endemic to Madagascar. But then in 2010, a second species was described, &quot;Geosiris albiflora,&quot; from Mayotte Island in the Indian Ocean northwest of Madagascar. In 2017, a third species was found in Queensland, Australia, &quot;Geosiris australiensis&quot;.

&quot;Geosiris aphylla&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;earth-iris.&quot; It is a small myco-heterotroph lacking chlorophyll and obtaining its nutrients from fungi in the soil. The genus name is derived from the Greek words &quot;geos&quot;, meaning &quot;earth&quot;, and &quot;iris&quot;, referring to the Iris family of plants.

Its rhizomes are slender and scaly, and stems are simple or branched. The leaves are alternate, but having no use, are reduced and scale-like. The flowers are light purple.

In 1939, F. P. Jonker assigned &quot;Geosiris&quot; to its own family Geosiridaceae in Orchidales, and this was adopted in the Cronquist system, with a note that the family was closely related to Iridaceae or Burmanniaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has since subsumed the family into Iridaceae; it is currently placed in the monotypic subfamily Geosiridoideae.

<text>&quot;Liebeslieder &quot; op. 114 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II written in 1852 (not to be confused with Brahms&#x27;s similarly titled &quot;Liebeslieder Walzer&quot; and &quot;Neue Liebeslieder&quot;). At the time it was conceived, the waltz was titled &#x27;Liebesgedichte&#x27; or &quot;Love Poems&quot; and during its first performance, it was even announced as &#x27;Liebesständchen&#x27; or &quot;Love Serenade&quot;. The first performance was at the famed Vienna Volksgarten on 18 June 1852 under the composer&#x27;s direction.

&#x27;Liebeslieder&#x27; stands among the master works of the Strauss Jr., who had, since 1849 an enduringly difficult time convincing the Viennese that his works deserve the attention it sought. The fierce and uncompromising Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick was even captivated by this waltz by writing in the journal &quot;Wiener Zeitung&quot; the following extract &quot;Those bad-tempered old-fashioned people, whose narrow-mindedness goes far as to call today&#x27;s dance music contemptible should be serenaded with ashaming generosity by the &#x27;Liebeslieder&#x27; of the young Johann Strauss.&quot;

In essence, the waltz is a love serenade of sorts in 3/4 time. The waltz starts quietly with pizzicato on the strings section of the orchestra before a full-bodied &#x27;forte&#x27; signals the beginning of the waltz sections. The first theme is that of a yearning feeling, before accelerating into a strong melody. The mood of the rest of the piece alternates between lushly romantic moods as well as light-heartedness, with the flute gently serenading the waltz sections 4 and 5. The piece ends dramatically, with a sense of anticipation, on a timpani drumroll and brass flourish.

The waltz also features many arrangements with a string orchestra as well as a quintet of strings. Curiously, many of these arrangements are labelled as &#x27;Music of the Old Vienna&#x27; when played with such an arrangement, as it could be possible that Strauss&#x27; melodies in this waltz invoke the feeling of the romance of the Old Vienna.

==Trivia==
*&quot;The Liebeslieder Singers&quot; is the name of the Chorus in Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler&#x27;s musical &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;.

<text>Katharina Dalton  (11 November 1916 – 17 September 2004) was a British physician and pioneer in the research of premenstrual stress syndrome (PMS), coining the term, treating many women and testifying as an expert witness in influential court cases.

==Background==
Katharina Dorothea Kuipers was born in London on 11 November 1916 to parents Anna Knoester and Johannes Kuipers. Johannes Kuipers, a merchant and freemason, died when Dalton was young. Despite her family&#x27;s financial troubles, Dalton attended the Royal Masonic School for Girls in London. As she grew, she wanted to be a doctor and, after winning a scholarship to the London Foot Hospital, first trained to be a chiropodist.

Dalton married her first husband, Wilfred Thompson, in 1939, but he died in World War II, not long after their son was born. Dalton then decided to change medical speciality, and obtained a medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital. Before graduating, she married Thomas Dalton, with whom she had three more children. Following the death of her husband Thomas in 1992, Katharina retired shortly after in 2000. She lived the rest of her days in Hereford and Poole, England and ultimately died on 17 September 2004.

== Accomplishments ==
Dr. Dalton became involved in the study of PMS in 1948, when, as a pregnant 32-year-old medical student, she realized her monthly migraine headaches had disappeared. Consulting with endocrinologist Dr. Raymond Greene, she concluded that the headaches could be attributed to a deficiency in the hormone progesterone, which drops before menstruation but soars during pregnancy. After further clinical study, Dalton and Greene published the theory in British medical journals in 1953 — first using the term &quot;premenstrual syndrome&quot; or PMS.

Dalton treated numerous women after setting up her own practice and concluded that PMS was a cyclical hormonal illness occurring in the 14 days following ovulation, with the most severe symptoms evident during the final four days before menstruation. In direct conflict with the views of many of her male colleagues, Dalton said the symptoms were more physical than psychological and included migraine headaches, asthma, epilepsy, skin lesions, irritability, fatigue, and depression.

In addition to her patients, she studied teenage schoolgirls, the mothers of abused children and women confined to prison for serious crimes, including murder. For example, she testified as an expert witness at the Old Bailey in the trial of Nicola Owen, who had burnt her parents&#x27; house down. Her research showed that during times of severe PMS, students&#x27; academic performance dipped and women were more likely to abuse their children or commit crimes. From historic anecdotes, she even concluded that Queen Victoria suffered from PMS, as indicated by reports of her monthly screaming and throwing objects at her husband, Prince Albert.
She is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder, and argued that the timing of PMS in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and violent crimes.

PMS, Dalton argued, was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy. She also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression. But today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other medications for the treatment of PMS.

In her later works, Dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by PMS, particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation. Dalton eventually became the first female president of the general practice section within the Royal Society of Medicine.

Another observation made by Dalton was that some symptoms of PMS, such as hypertension, edema, and albumin in the urine, were predictors of toxaemia during pregnancy. Patients were administered an initial dose of progesterone during early symptoms and given continuous treatment if symptoms were still present. Using progesterone in trials in maternity hospitals, the incidence rate of toxemia dropped from 9 percent to 1 percent.

Dalton refused use of progestins (synthetic progestogens) in treatment as she believed they were the cause of side effects. She preferred bio-identical, or natural progesterone. In addition, Dalton only supported the use of natural progesterone as she claims that only natural progesterone fit progesterone receptors. Most of her treatments used generous doses of progesterone as she believed that there was no unsafe dose, with 400 milligrams via suppository being the minimum dose. Other positive effects of progesterone include increased hair growth and treatment of brain trauma.

After her work on PMS, she turned to postpartum depression (PPD). The large drop in hormone levels after giving birth can cause new mothers to feel symptoms of tiredness, irritability, and depression, similar to PMS. According to Dalton, these symptoms are considered mild, whereas more severe symptoms can include anxiety as well as changes in personality. In addition, she states that approximately three in one thousand new mothers may experience more severe symptoms of PPD referred to as postpartum psychosis. Symptoms of this psychosis may include hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, and even thoughts of killing their newborn child. Dalton suggested using progesterone therapy to prevent this from happening, usually starting after the end of labour. Her proposed therapy was intended to help slow the speed at which the progesterone hormone naturally drops.

Katharina Dalton published many books including: &quot;The Menstrual Cycle&quot; (1969); &quot;Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy&quot; (1977); &quot;Once a Month: The Original Premenstrual Syndrome Handbook&quot; (1978), which became a best seller, and &quot;Depression after Childbirth: How to Recognize, Treat, and Prevent Postnatal Depression&quot;.

== Personal life ==

After the death of her first husband, Dalton married Tom Dalton, who died in 1992. She had four children, Michael, Thomas, Wendy, and Maureen. Dalton also had five grandchildren, including the British MEP Daniel Dalton. On 17 September 2004, Dalton died in Poole at the age of 87.

<text>In the theory of superalgebras, if &quot;A&quot; is a commutative superalgebra, &quot;V&quot; is a free right &quot;A&quot;-supermodule and &quot;T&quot; is an endomorphism from &quot;V&quot; to itself, then the supertrace of &quot;T&quot;, str(&quot;T&quot;) is defined by the following trace diagram:

More concretely, if we write out &quot;T&quot; in block matrix form after the decomposition into even and odd subspaces as follows,

:formula_1

then the supertrace

:str(&quot;T&quot;) = the ordinary trace of &quot;T&quot;00 − the ordinary trace of &quot;T&quot;11.

Let us show that the supertrace does not depend on a basis.
Suppose e1, ..., ep are the even basis vectors and e&quot;p&quot;+1, ..., e&quot;p&quot;+&quot;q&quot; are the odd basis vectors. Then, the components of &quot;T&quot;, which are elements of &quot;A&quot;, are defined as

:formula_2

The grading of &quot;T&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the sum of the gradings of &quot;T&quot;, e&quot;i&quot;, e&quot;j&quot; mod 2.

A change of basis to e1&#x27;, ..., ep&#x27;, e(&quot;p&quot;+1)&#x27;, ..., e(&quot;p&quot;+&quot;q&quot;)&#x27; is given by the supermatrix

:formula_3

and the inverse supermatrix

:formula_4

where of course, &quot;AA&quot;−1 = &quot;A&quot;−1&quot;A&quot; = 1 (the identity).

We can now check explicitly that the supertrace is basis independent. In the case where &quot;T&quot; is even, we have

:formula_5

In the case where &quot;T&quot; is odd, we have
:formula_6

The ordinary trace is not basis independent, so the appropriate trace to use in the Z2-graded setting is the supertrace.

The supertrace satisfies the property
:formula_7
for all &quot;T&quot;1, &quot;T&quot;2 in End(&quot;V&quot;). In particular, the supertrace of a supercommutator is zero.

In fact, one can define a supertrace more generally for any associative superalgebra &quot;E&quot; over a commutative superalgebra &quot;A&quot; as a linear map tr: &quot;E&quot; -&gt; &quot;A&quot; which vanishes on supercommutators. Such a supertrace is not uniquely defined; it can always at least be modified by multiplication by an element of &quot;A&quot;.

==Physics applications==

In supersymmetric quantum field theories, in which the action integral is invariant under a set of symmetry transformations (known as supersymmetry transformations) whose algebras are superalgebras, the supertrace has a variety of applications. In such a context, the supertrace of the mass matrix for the theory can be written as a sum over spins of the traces of the mass matrices for particles of different spin:

:formula_8

In anomaly-free theories where only renormalizable terms appear in the superpotential, the above supertrace can be shown to vanish, even when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. 

The contribution to the effective potential arising at one loop (sometimes referred to as the Coleman–Weinberg potential) can also be written in terms of a supertrace. If formula_9 is the mass matrix for a given theory, the one-loop potential can be written as

:formula_10

where formula_11 and formula_12 are the respective tree-level mass matrices for the separate bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory and formula_13 is a cutoff scale.

<doc id="1249741" wikidata="Q5993257" url="?curid=1249741" title="Igor Gamow">
<text>Rustem Igor Gamow (November 4, 1935, in Georgetown, D.C. – April 15, 2021) was a microbiology professor at the University of Colorado and inventor. His best known inventions included the Gamow bag and the Shallow Underwater Breathing Apparatus. He was fired from CU in 2004 following sexual harassment and assault charges.

==Early life and education==
Rustem Igor Gamow was the son of Soviet émigré physicists George Gamow and Lyubov Vokhmintseva &quot;Rho&quot; Gamow. Finishing high school at age 17, he joined the National Ballet Company. He worked breaking horses, delivering packages by motorcycle, and teaching karate before enrolling at the University of Colorado in 1958, where his father taught. Igor Gamow received a B.A. and M.S. in biology, and a Ph.D. in biophysics, all at University of Colorado.

== Research ==
Gamow worked on Phycomyces blakesleeanus during postdoctoral research under Max Delbrück at Caltech. At CU-Boulder, he did &quot;Phycomyces&quot; research for over twenty years, mainly on the avoidance and anemotropic responses, helical growth, and cell-wall mechanical properties. He also studied the infrared-detectors of the Boa constrictor.

An avid outdoorsman, Gamow developed a number of inventions for safety in outdoor activities. His first important one, patented in 1990, was the Gamow bag enabling mountain climbers to avoid altitude sickness by raising the surrounding pressure. Sir Edmund Hillary, the first expedition leader to summit Mount Everest, wrote him in congratulation. Another was the Shallow Underwater Breathing Apparatus (&quot;SUBA&quot;), a pressurized snorkel system permitting swimmers to breathe easily as deep as ten feet under water.

Igor Gamow also worked in bionics, on an orthopedic knee brace that stores energy within a spring from the hamstring and redirects it to the quadriceps.

== Termination at CU ==

In 2002, a former assistant of Gamow&#x27;s filed a lawsuit against the university alleging sexual harassment and sexual assault of seven women. After the lawsuit was filed, the university began to take steps to terminate Gamow. In 2004 the CU Board of Regents unanimously upheld the recommendation to dismiss Gamow for &quot;moral turpitude&quot;. Gamow filed a lawsuit against CU in an attempt to be reinstated.

In May 2006, CU lost a lawsuit that had been filed by Gamow&#x27;s former assistant and was ordered to pay her $285,000 plus attorney&#x27;s fees.

In September 2011, Gamow released an open letter addressing some misconceptions about events leading to his termination from the University of Colorado.
