<text>WKS Grunwald Poznań is a multi-sports club based in Poznań, Poland. The handball section had been champions several times whereas the field hockey section is one of the top teams not only in the country but in Europe. Other sections have been champions in Poland and have had Olympic representation.

==Naming history==
*1947–1950: Wojskowy Klub Sportowy &quot;Kadra&quot; Poznań
*1950–1957: Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Poznań
*1957–present: Wojskowy Klub Sportowy Grunwald Poznań

==Establishment==
The club was founded by a group of officers and deputy officers of the Poznań garrison. The founding meeting was held at the seat of the Municipal Office of Physical Education and Military Training at ul. Matejki 61. The name of WKS Kadra Poznań and the club&#x27;s statute were established, the management board, the audit committee and the court of honor were elected. Kazimierz Gawrycki, the then commander of the MUWFiPW in Poznań, became the first president. The first sports sections were also established: football, boxing, athletics, shooting and tennis.

==Sections==
===Active===

The club has several active sections: athletics, field hockey, freestyle wrestling, handball, orienteering, shooting, taekwondo and tennis.

====Athletics and orienteering====
The orienteering section was founded in 1987. The first success of the section was winning in 1988 the gold medal of the Polish Championships in the relay, the team consisting of: Gliszczyński, Domagała, Niedzielski. In 1993 they recorded the first international success; the bronze medal at the Junior World Championships was won in the relay race by Robert Banach and Dariusz Mikusiński. Then came further successes: Dariusz Mikusiński became the vice-champion of the CISM Army World Championships, and Robert Banach became the Junior World Champion. The silver medal of the Championship was won by Janusz Gliszczyński, and the relay race with Małgorzata Stankiewicz came third. In the following years, Robert Banach and Sławomir Woźniak also won medals at the CISM World Military Championships. Since the founding of the section, its athletes have won over 300 Polish Championship medals. This success is largely attributed to long-serving coach Tadeusz Rutkowski, who over the years raised several generations of athletes who represented Poland in international competitions. Currently, 23 professional athletes belong to the section, and Bartosz Pawlak and Michał Olejnik are among the national leaders in their disciplines.

In the athletics section, training is focused on senior squad, which currently has six professional athletes. Since its inception, the athletes have also won a large number of medals in the Polish Championships, as well as many medals in the World and European Military Championships. Competitors such as Henryk Szost, Michał Kaczmarek, Mariusz Giżyński and Monika Stefanowicz have repeatedly won individual and team medals in the military championships, and Henryk Szost is the current country record holder in the marathon with a time of 2:07:39.

====Field hockey====

The section was officially founded in 1952, after takeover of a 3 -time champion military club WKS Poznań dating back to the inter-war period The section is the most successful club in the country, a European contender since the early 90s and dominant force domestically, both traditional outdoor and indoor in equal measure.

====Handball====

The handball section is historically one of the most successful, and was a dominant force in the country in the 70s and 80s.

====Freestyle wrestling====
The freestyle wrestling section was founded in 1951, where recruitment was organised through the local press.

The most notable athletes were Władysław Stecyk, Grunwald athlete in 1969–1988; and Monika Michalik, bronze medalist of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olynpics and gold medalist of the 2017 European Wrestling Championships in Novi Sad. Paweł Kurczewski was the world silver medalist in 1971, and Adam Sobieraj won the bronze medal at the 2010 European Wrestling Championships. The club also has produced numerous Olympians regularly throughout its history.

As a team they won the third division in their debut year in 1951 and the second division in 1952, winning promotion to the top division. They won the second division in 1970 and the Polish championship in 1972.

====Shooting====
The shooting section was founded on 12 March 1963. The club is a member of PZSS and WZSS.

====Tennis====
The tennis section was one of the first section founded upon establishment of the club, in 1947. However the section initially survived only until 1951. It was reactivated in the years 1959 to 1967. After this period, the section was only re-established 46 years later, on 11 June 2003. As a junior, the club was represented by Magda Linette with successes at junior level. The section currently has 8 courts of which 2 are covered. The club won the women&#x27;s team championships in 2010 and 2011.

===Defunct===
The following sections have existed in the past: association football, boxing, rowing, table tennis.

====Association football====

Football was the first section to be created upon establishment of the club, and existed between 1947 and 1985. Although not the most successful section of the club by any means, it did reach the higher echelons of the league pyramid and did reach the latter stages of the Polish Cup twice; in the 1966–67 and 1975–76 seasons.

<text>Otoplasty (, , &quot;ear&quot; + , , &quot;to shape&quot;) is a procedure for correcting the deformities and defects of the auricle (external ear), whether these defects are congenital conditions (e.g. microtia, anotia, etc.) or caused by trauma. Otoplastic surgeons may reshape, move, or augment the cartilaginous support framework of the auricle to correct these defects.

Congenital ear deformities occasionally overlap with other medical conditions (e.g. Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia).

==History==

===Antiquity===
Otoplasty (surgery of the ear) was developed in ancient India and is described in the medical compendium, the (Sushruta&#x27;s Compendium, ). The book discussed otoplastic and other plastic surgery techniques and procedures for correcting, repairing and reconstructing ears, noses, lips, and genitalia that were amputated as criminal, religious, and military punishments. The ancient Indian medical knowledge and plastic surgery techniques of the were practiced throughout Asia until the late 18th century; the October 1794 issue of the contemporary British &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported the practice of rhinoplasty, as described in the . Moreover, two centuries later, contemporary practices of otoplastic praxis were derived from the techniques and procedures developed and established in antiquity by Sushruta.

===19th century===
In (&quot;Operational Surgery&quot;, 1845), Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794–1847) reported the first surgical approach for the correction of prominent ears — a combination otoplasty procedure that featured the simple excision (cutting) of the problematic excess cartilage from the posterior sulcus (back groove) of the ear, and the subsequent affixing, with sutures, of the corrected auricle to the mastoid periosteum, the membrane covering the mastoid process at the underside of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, at the back of the head.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In 1920, Harold D. Gillies (1882–1960) first reproduced the auricle by burying an external-ear support framework, made of autologous rib cartilage, under the skin of the mastoid region of the head, which reconstructed the auricle; he then separated this from the skin of the mastoid area by means of a cervical flap. In 1937, Dr. Gillies also attempted a similar pediatric ear reconstruction with an auricle support framework fabricated from maternal cartilage. This otoplasty correction technique proved inadequate, due to the problems inherent to the biochemical breakdown and elimination (resorption) of the cartilage tissue by the patient&#x27;s body.

In 1964, Radford C. Tanzer (1921–2004) re-emphasized the use of autologous cartilage as the most advantageously reliable organic material for resolving microtia (abnormally small ears), because of its great histologic viability, resistance to shrinkage, and resistance to softening, and lower incidence of resorption.

The development of plastic surgery procedures, such as the refinement of J.F. Dieffenbach&#x27;s ear surgery techniques, has established more than 170 otoplasty procedures for correcting prominent ears, and for correcting defects and deformities of the auricle; as such, otoplasty corrections are in three surgical-technique groups:
* Group I - Techniques that leave intact the cartilage support-framework of the ear, and reconfigure the distance and the angle of projection of the auricle from the head, solely by means of sutures, as in the permanent suture-insertion of the Mustardé technique the Merck stitch method and the incisionless Fritsch otoplasty for creating an anti helical fold:
** Mustardé technique: An open invasive method, whereby the retroauricular cartilage is extensively exposed, a part of the skin is excised, and mattress sutures are inserted.
** Merck stitch method: a minimally invasive method, by which the ear is no longer cut open and the cartilage is left completely intact. The mattress sutures are inserted in the ear through 2 to 3 small stab incisions on the back of the ear.
** Incisionless Fritsch otoplasty: It is a combination of the minimally invasive technique and the Stenström technique, whereby the cartilage on the front of the ear is scored with superficial incisions.
* Group II — Techniques that resect (cut and remove) the pertinent excess cartilage from the support-framework of the auricle, which then render it pliable to being re-molded, reconfigured, and affixed to the head at the projection distance-and-angle characteristic of a normal ear; the relevant procedures are the cartilage-incision Converse technique and the Chongchet–Stenström technique for the anterior-correction of prominent ears.
* Group III — Techniques that combine the excision of cartilage portions from the support framework of the auricle, in order to reduce the degree of projection and the distance of the external ear from the head.

==Surgical anatomy of the external ear==

===The auricle===
The external ear (auricle) is a surgically challenging area in terms of anatomy, composed of a delicate and complex framework of shaped cartilage that is covered, on its visible surface, with thin, tightly adherent, hairless skin. Although of small area, the surface anatomy of the external ear is complex, consisting of the auricle and the external auditory meatus (auditory canal). The outer framework of the auricle is composed of the rim of the helix, which arises from the front and from below (anteriorly and inferiorly), from a crus (shank) that extends horizontally above the auditory canal. The helix merges downwards (inferiorly) into the cauda helices (tail of the helix), and connects to the lobule (earlobe). The region located between the crura (shanks) of the antihelix is the triangular fossa (depression), while the scapha (elongated depression) lies between the helix and antihelix. The antihelix borders in the middle (medially) to the rim of the concha (shell) and the concha proper, which is composed of the conchal cymba above (superiorly) and the conchal cavum below (inferiorly), which are separated by the helical crus, and meet the antihelix at the antihelical rim. The tragus (auditory canal lobule) and the antitragus (counterpart lobule) are separated by the intertragal notch; the auditory canal lobule does not contain cartilage, and displays varied morphologic shapes and attachments to the adjacent cheek and scalp.

===Blood supply and innervation===
The superficial temporal and posterior auricular arteries preserve the arterial blood supply of the external ear. The sensory innervation involves the front and back (anterior and posterior) branches of the greater auricular nerve, and is reinforced by the auricular temporal and lesser occipital nerves. The auricular branch of the vagus nerves supplies a portion of the posterior wall of the external auditory canal.

===Otoplastic praxis===
The support framework of the reconstructed auricle must be more rigid than the natural cartilage framework of a normal ear, in order for it to remain of natural size, proportion, and contour. If the reconstructed auricle framework were as structurally delicate as the cartilage framework of a natural auricle, its anatomic verisimilitude as an ear would gradually be eroded by a combination of the pressure of the tight skin-envelope in the temporal region of the head, and of the pressure of the progressive contracture of the surgical scar(s).

===Prominent ears===
In the practice of otoplasty, the term &quot;prominent ears&quot; describes external ears (auricles) that, regardless of their size, protrude from the sides of the head. The abnormal appearance exceeds the normal head-to-ear measures, wherein the external ear is less than , and at an angle of less than 25 degrees, from the side of the head. Ear configurations, of distance and angle, that exceed the normal measures, appear prominent when the man or the woman is viewed from either the front or the back perspective. In the occurrence of prominent ears, the common causes of anatomic defect, deformity, and abnormality can occur individually or in combination; they are:

# Underdeveloped antihelical foldThis anatomic deformity occurs consequent to the inadequate folding of the antihelix, which causes the protrusion of the scapha and the helical rim. The defect is manifested by the prominence of the scapha (the elongated depression separating the helix and the antihelix) and the upper-third of the ear; and occasionally of the middle third of the ear.
# Prominent conchaThis deformity is caused either by an excessively deep concha, or by an excessively wide concha-mastoid angle (&lt;25 degrees). These two anatomic abnormalities can occur in combination, and produce a prominent concha (the largest, deepest concavity of the auricle), which then causes the prominence of the middle third of the external ear.
# Protruding earlobeThis defect of the earlobe causes the prominence of the lower third of the auricle.

Although most prominent ears are anatomically normal, morphologic defects, deformities, and abnormalities do occur, such as the:
* Constricted ear which features an abnormally small auricle, and protrudes from the head because of the inadequate development of the circumference of the helical rim, which, in turn, causes the auricle to collapse forwards, and form a &#x27;cup ear.
* Cryptotic ear which is hidden in the side of the head. The condition of a hidden ear is produced when the developed helix of the auricle is contained under the skin of the scalp in the temporal region. (see Cryptotia)
* Macrotic ear, a prominent external ear that features an oversized auricle, but is otherwise morphologically normal. (see Macrotia)
* Question mark ear describes the ear that features a deformity of the supralobular region (upper area of the auricle), and has the appearance of a question mark.
* Stahl&#x27;s ear deformity describes the presence of a third crus (shank) in the auricle, which produces a pointed elfin ear. The third crus is additional to the two crura (shanks) of the normal triangular fossa (depression), which traverses the scapha (elongated depression separating the helix and the antihelix).

===Angles of the ear===

====Cephaloauricular and scaphoconchal angles====
The degrees of angle between the head and the ear, and the degrees of angle between the scapha and the concha, determine the concept of prominent ears. The study, &quot;Comparing Cephaloauricular and Scaphaconchal Angles in Prominent Ear Patients and Control Subjects&quot; (2008) reported that the comparisons of the head-to-ear angles and the scapaha-to-concha angles of a 15-patient cohort with prominent ears, with the analogous ear angles of a 15-person control group, established that the average head-to-ear angle was 47.7 degrees for the study group, and 31.1 degrees for the control group; and that the average scapha-to-concha angle was 132.6 degrees for the study cohort, and 106.7 degrees for the control group.
====Antihelix====
The antihelix normally forms a symmetric Y-shaped structure in which the gently rolled (folded) crest of the root of the antihelix continues upwards as the superior crus, and the inferior crus branches forwards, from the root, as a folded ridge. The root of the inferior crus of the antihelix sharply defines the rim of the concha. Moreover, the inferior crus also forms the wall that separates the concha from the triangular fossa. The root and superior crus of the antihelix form the anterior wall of the scaphoid fossa, and the helix forms the posterior wall. The triangular fossa dips within the Y-arms of the superior and inferior crura. The corrugated contours of these auricular crests and valleys provide a pillar effect (support) that stabilizes the auricle. The vertical walls of the conchal cup translate to a semi-horizontal plane as the concha merges with the folded crest of the antihelix. The scapha–helix is nearly parallel to the plane of the temporal surface of the head. If the roll of the antihelix and its crest are effaced and flat, rather than rolled or folded, the steep pitch of the conchal wall continues into the un-formed antihelix and scapha and ends at the helix, with little interruption. Said planar orientation places the scapha–helix complex nearly perpendicular to the temporal plane of the head — because of which the ear appears prominent, thus, such an ear also lacks the stability provided by the pillar effect, and so allows the superior auricular pole to protrude. In the literature, effacement (deficiency) of the antihelical fold is the foremost subject of most discussions of the prominent ear, because it is an aurical deformity manifested as a spectrum of defects and deformities — ranging from an indistinguishable antihelix (with a confluent concavity, from antihelix to scapha and the helical rim projected outwards and forwards) to loss of definition solely of the superior antihelix (with prominence of the upper pole of the ear).

====Concha====
The concha of the ear is an irregular hemispheric bowl with a defined rim. The normal scapha–helix surrounds the posterior part of the bowl (much as the brim of an inverted hat surrounds the crown). The pitch at which the scapha–helix projects from the conchal cup is determined:

# By the acuteness of the fold of the crest of the antihelix
# By the height of the posterior wall of the conchal bowl, and:
# By the completeness of the hemisphere formed by the concha

If the posterior wall of the concha is excessively high, and the concha is excessively spherical, then there is an excessive angle and distance between the plane of the scapha–helix and the plane of the temporal surface of the head. Such protrusion usually is evenly distributed around the posterior conchal wall, however, the cephalad part of the concha can protrude disproportionately, another cause for a protruding upper pole. Similarly, the caudal part of the concha can project disproportionately, and cause a protruding lower auricular pole, therefore, these deformational features require special attention in the operating room.

Moreover, regarding the shape and projection of the ear, the importance of the concha must be considered in relation to the three-tiered configuration of the auricular cartilage framework, because the more delicate antihelix and helical complex are mounted upon the sturdier concha; therefore, changes in conchal size and shape greatly influence the overlying tiers, hence it is rare to see prominence of the ear that does not have a conchal element. The concha affects the prominence of the ear three-fold ways:

# The overall enlargement of the concha projects the ear away from the mastoid surface;
# An extension of the helical crus across the concha creates a firm cartilage bar that pushes the ear outwards
# The effect of the angulation of the cartilage, at the junction between the cavum concha; and the sweep of cartilage up to the antitragal prominence, affects the position and prominence of the lobule (earlobe) and lower third of the ear.

Understanding the first deformational element is well recognized, and, despite limited attention to the second element, once seen, it is easily understood. Therefore, understanding the third element leads to understanding the surgical-technical approach to correcting the isolated lower-pole and lobule prominence. The latter feature of conchal shape, while not the sole cause of lobular prominence, appears to play a key role. As the cartilage angle, between the concha cavum and the antitragus, becomes more acute (i.e. as the antitragus tips closer towards the concha), this supporting structure outwardly projects the lobule and the lower-third of the ear. This feature has a greater influence upon the lobule position than does the commonly described helical tail.

====Protruding antihelix and protruding concha combined====
The combined effects of an effaced antihelix and a deep concha also contribute to severe auricular protrusion (a very prominent ear).

====Protruding mastoid process====

====Auricular prominence====
The occurrence of a prominent mastoid process tends to push the concha forward, which extends the auricle (external ear) away from the side of the head. The external ear is mounted upon the bony base of the underlying temporal bone, therefore, anomalies and asymmetries of the skeletal shape can cause either auricle, or both auricles, to become prominent. In relation to the protruding mastoid process, the most recognizable skeletal anomaly is the change in the position and in the projection of the auricle, as associated with non-synostotic plagiocephaly (the positional flattening of the side of the head, not caused by the inappropriate union of two bones). Hence, in the occurrence of a flattening of the skull (parallelogram deformation of the cranial vault), the side of the head afflicted with occipital plagiocephaly presents a prominent ear. In subtle cases, the prominent ear might be more readily evident in an elder patient, whose ears are asymmetrically positioned, reason for which the residual occipital flattening (occipital plagiocephaly), and mild facial asymmetry, are unapparent at first view. This effect, of the shape of the patient&#x27;s head, upon the outward and extended position of the ear is notably indicated in the 1881 illustrations that describe the Ely otoplasty technique.

====Hemifacial microsomia====
The undersized development of one side of a person&#x27;s face, demonstrates the influence of skeletal development upon the position of the external ear on the head, as caused by the deficient morphologic development of the temporal bone, and by the medial positioning of the temporomandibular joint, the synovial joint between the temporal bone and the mandible (upper jaw). Moreover, in severe cases of hemifacial microsomia, without the occurrence of microtia (small ears), the normal external ear might appear to have been sheared off the head, because the upper half of the auricle is projecting outwards, and, at the middle point, the lower half of the auricle is canted inwards, towards the hypoplastic, underdeveloped side of the face of the patient. A similar type of asymmetric development of the head and face features a relatively broad head, a narrow face, and a narrow mandible; when observed from the front perspective, the head and face of the person present a triangular configuration. Such wide-to-narrow skeletal sloping, from the head to the face, might create the bone promontory upon which rests and from which projects the upper anatomy of the auricle, which otherwise is an external ear of normal proportions, size, and contour.

====Protruding cauda helicis====
The cauda helicis (tail of the helix) is bound to the fibrofatty tissues of the earlobe by a network of connective tissue. The tail of the helix (cauda helicis), which projects outwards from the concha, carries the earlobe with it, causing it to protrude, which physical condition contributes to prominence of the lower pole of the auricle.

====Protruding earlobe====
Given the morphological diversity of the earlobes found among men, women, and children, some earlobes are large, some earlobes are pendulous, and some earlobes are large and pendulous, but some are prominent because of the structure and form of the dense, interlacing connective tissue fibers that shape the earlobe anatomy independent of the tail of the helix (cauda helicis).

====Soft tissues====
Functionally, the external ear is served by three ear muscles, the auricularis posterior muscle (rear ear-muscle), the auricularis superior muscle (upper ear-muscle), and the auricularis anterior muscle (front ear-muscle), the most notable of which is the auricularis posterior muscle, which functions to pull the ear backwards, because it is superficially attached to the ponticulus (bridge) of the conchal cartilage, and to the posterior auricular ligament (rear ligament of the ear). The posterior muscle of the ear is composed of two to three fascicles (skeletal-muscle fibers contained in perimysium connective tissue), originates from the mastoid process of the temporal bone and is inserted to the lower part of the cranial surface of the concha, where it is surrounded by fibroareolar tissue deep within the temporal fascia. The posterior auricular artery irrigates the ear tissues with small, branch-artery blood vessels (rami). Likewise, the rear muscle of the ear is innervated with fine rami of the posterior auricular nerve, which is a branch of the facial nerve. Deep within these muscle and ligament structures lie the mastoid fascia and the tendinous origin of the sternomastoid muscle.

==Surgical otoplasty==
The corrective goal of otoplasty is to set back the ears so that they appear naturally proportionate and contoured without evidence or indication of surgical correction. Therefore, when the corrected ears are viewed, they should appear normal, from the:

# Front perspective: when the ear (auricle) is viewed from the front, the helical rim should be visible, but not set back so far (flattened) that it is hidden behind the antihelical fold.
# Rear perspective: when the auricle is viewed from behind, the helical rim is straight, not bent, as if resembling the letter &#x27;C&#x27; (the middle-third to flat), or crooked, as if resembling a hockey stick (the earlobe is insufficiently flat). If the helical rim is straight, the upper-, middle-, and lower-thirds of the auricle will be proportionately setback in relation to each other.
# Side perspective: the contours of the ear should be soft and natural, not sharp and artificial.

The severity of the ear deformity that is to be corrected determines the advantageous timing of an otoplasty; for example, in children with extremely prominent ears, 4 years old is a reasonable age. In cases of macrotia associated with prominent ears, the child&#x27;s age might be 2 years. Nonetheless, it is advantageous to restrict the further growth of the deformed ear. Regardless of the patient&#x27;s age, the otoplasty procedure requires that the patient be under general anaesthesia.

===Ear reconstruction===
Generally, for reconstructing an entire ear, or a portion of the rim cartilage, the surgeon first harvests a costal cartilage graft from the patient&#x27;s rib cage, which then is sculpted into an auricular framework that is emplaced under the temporal skin of the patient&#x27;s head, so that the skin envelope encompass the cartilage framework, the ear prosthesis. Once placed and anchored with sutures, the surgeon then creates an auricle (outer ear) of natural proportions, contour, and appearance. In the next months, in follow-up surgeries, the surgeon then creates an earlobe, and also separates the reconstructed auricle from the side of the head (), in order to create a tragus, the small, rounded projection located before the external entrance to the ear canal.

In the case of the patient encumbered with several congenital defects of the ear or who has insufficient autologous cartilage to harvest, it might be unfeasible to effect the corrections with grafts of rib cartilage. In such a case, the reconstructive Antia–Buch helical advancement technique may instead be used, wherein tissue is moved from behind the ear rim and then around and forward to repair the defective front of the ear rim. To perform the Antia–Buch helical advancement, the surgeon first designs the incision inside the helical rim and around the crus (shank) of the helix with ink. The surgeon then cuts the skin and the cartilage, but does not pierce the posterior skin of the ear. The helical rim then is advanced to allow the suturing (closure), and a dog-ear-shaped graft of skin is removed from the back of the ear. The closure of the sutures advances the crus of the helix into the helical rim.

===Indications===
The ear defect or deformity to be corrected determines the otoplasty techniques and procedures to be applied: for example, a torn earlobe can be repaired solely with sutures; a slight damage to the rim of the auricle might be repaired with an autologous skin graft harvested from the scalp; and conversely, a proper ear reconstruction might require several surgeries. In the correction of infantile ear defects and deformities, the otoplasty usually is performed when the child is about six years old, as the healthy ear is almost adult-sized, and thus can act as a corrective template for the auricular reconstruction.

The otoplastic technique(s) applied to correct, reconstruct, or replace a deformed, defective, or a missing ear, is determined by the indications that the patient presents; some are:
* Cagot ear — A congenital defect characterized by ears without an earlobe; the name of the defect derives from the Cagot minority of northern Spain and western France, where it was a common belief that they had no earlobes.
* Cat&#x27;s ear — A defect characterized by the outer edges of the ears folded forward, away from the sides of the head, and towards the face; hence the person&#x27;s feline appearance. The plastic correction anchors, and thus flattens, the ear against the head.
* Cauliflower ear — An ear deformed by repeated trauma (injury) to the tissues as occurs to boxers and wrestlers; the name of deformity derives from its resemblance to a cauliflower. A hematoma might also result from an acute trauma, and, unless evacuated, the blood in the ear tends to become cartilaginous, resulting in a &quot;cauliflower ear&quot;, which, once fully developed, is very difficult to correct. The successful management of a hematoma might require either repeated aspirations or an incision to fully evacuate the accumulated blood. After evacuation of the blood, the management of an acute othematoma of the concha features through-and-through bolster sutures to compress the skin against the cartilage, which usually prevents recurrence.
* Cleft earlobe — A defect characterized by an indentation (notch) to the fleshy portion of the earlobe. The usual correction is transplantation of an autologous tissue graft.
* Constricted ear — In mild cases of constricted ear, the crus (shank) of the helix is advanced out of the concha, and into the helical rim in order to increase its circumference. In severe cases of constricted ear, some of the cartilage is discarded and a complete reconstruction of the auricle is performed, as in the procedure for correcting microtia.
* Cryptotia — The hidden ear features the rim of the helix cartilage buried under the skin of the scalp in the temporal region. After making an incision, the upper portion of the ear is exposed by outward traction on the auricle, after making an incision around the visible helical rim. Then, the medial surface of the freed helical-rim cartilage is resurfaced either with a skin graft or with a skin flap. In most cases of cryptotia, the upper-ear cartilage that is buried under the scalp is developmentally normal, but occasionally, it is abnormal and might also require correction.
* Darwinian ear — A defect wherein the rim cartilage of the conchal bowl of the ear is flat, rather than folded inwards; it is an evolutionary remnant from when the human head muscles permitted the person to voluntarily prick up the ears in a given direction. The &#x27;Darwinian ear&#x27; eponym derives from Charles Darwin (1809–1882), the British biologist and evolutionary theoretician (see Darwin&#x27;s tubercle).
* Lop ear — A protruding ear characterized by the defects of a too-small helix (the cartilage-stiffened rim of the auricle) and a large, central depression around the auricular canal (ear opening); the combined effects of the deformations produce a &quot;cup ear&quot; appearance. The usual plastic correction is enlargement of the helix and closer anchoring to the head.
* Macrotia — Ears that are proportionately oversized to the person&#x27;s head; the surgeon reduces them by making an incision on the lateral surface of the auricle, just inside the helical rim. The scapha (elongated hollow) is reduced, and a segment of the helical rim is excised, and the incision is closed primarily to avoid redundancy.
* Microtia — A congenital defect characterized by either the severe underdevelopment or the absence of the auricle. At one end of the spectrum is an auricle slightly smaller than normal, but of normal appearance, and at the other end of the spectrum is anotia, the absence of the auricle. The &#x27;Nagata classification&#x27; correlates the ear deformity with the surgical approach thus:
** Lobule type — The patient has an ear remnant and malpositioned lobule, but no concha, acoustic meatus, or tragus.
** Concha type — The patients presents an ear remnant, malpositioned earlobe, concha (with or without acoustic meatus), tragus, and antitragus with an incisura intertragica.
** Small concha type — The patient presents an ear remnant, malpositioned lobule, and a small indentation instead of a concha.
** Anotia — The patient presents either no ear remnant, or a minute, ear remnant. (v) Atypical microtia — The patient presents deformities of the ear that are not comprehended in the four preceding Nagata classifications.
* Question mark ear — A rare congenital defect characterized by a protuberant auricle with a cleft (indentation) between the earlobe and the outer cartilage rim, between the fifth and sixth hillocks. This deformity also is known as &#x27;Cosman ear&#x27;, after Dr. Bard Cosman (1931–1983), the American plastic surgeon who identified it. The degree of anatomical deficiency is variable, and usually can be corrected with a cartilage graft and a V-Y advancement-flap of retroauricular skin, harvested from the back of the ear, because there often is excess skin in the upper-third of the ear being corrected. To reconstruct a &#x27;Question mark&#x27; ear featuring a severely deformed auricle, the otoplastic procedure for correcting microtia is applied.
* Scroll ear — A congenital defect characterized by the outer edge of the ear curling forward, inwards (like a curled scroll), and towards the head.
* Skin cancer and malignant melanoma — Cutaneous malignancies of the helical rim can be excised and closed with the Antia–Buch helical advancement technique. Cancerous lesions in the concha or over the antihelix can usually be excised and skin grafted. If the cartilage is involved, it can be excised and the graft placed directly on the posterior skin. Malignant melanomas should be excised with the same margins as melanomas of the equivalent depth in other parts of the body. Melanoma &quot;in situ&quot; does not require a full-thickness excision, and is excised with a margin, to preserve the perichondrium, and then covered with a skin graft. Invasive melanomas of the helical rim require wedge resection to achieve adequate margins; these defects might be large and require secondary reconstruction.
* Stahl&#x27;s ear deformity — A pointed-ear defect characterized by an abnormal folding of the skin and cartilage of the auricle, which produce an &quot;elfin ear&quot; characterized by an ear-rim with a pointed upper-edge, rather than a rounded upper-edge.
* Wildermuth&#x27;s ear — A congenital defect characterized by a backwards-oriented helix (the auricle&#x27;s curved, cartilage border), which deforms the ear by protruding the ante-helix (inner ridge of the auricle). The eponym derives from Hermann A. Wildermuth (1852–1907), the German neurologist who identified the defect.

=== Surgical procedures ===
Otoplastic surgery can be performed upon a patient under anesthesia — local anesthesia, local anesthesia with sedation, or general anesthesia (usual for children). In order to correct a lop ear with a small helix (the cartilage-supported outer rim of the auricle), an incision to one side of a flat cartilage piece leaves unopposed elastic forces on the opposite side, which permits the evolution of the ear contour; thus, a small incision on one side of the lop-ear cartilage, along the new anti-helical fold, can be a technical element of the corrective ear surgery. Yet, when done without an incision, the procedure is deemed an &#x27;incisionless otoplasty&#x27;, wherein the surgeon places a needle through the skin, to model the cartilage and to emplace the retention sutures that will affix the antihelix and conchal bowl areas.

====Surgical otoplasty techniques====
Depending upon the auricular defect, deformity, or reconstruction required, the surgeon applies these three otoplastic techniques, either individually or in combination to achieve an outcome that produces an ear of natural proportions, contour, and appearance:
* Antihelical fold manipulation
** Suturing of the cartilage: the surgeon emplaces mattress sutures on the back of the ears, which are tied with sufficient tension to increase the definition of the antihelical fold, thereby setting back the helical rim. The cartilage is not treated. This is the technique of Mustardé and Merck, though each method differs: whereas the Mustardé method is an open invasive method, by which the cartilage on the back of the ears is extensively exposed and an area of skin is excised, the Merck method is a closed minimally invasive procedure, by which the cartilage is not exposed anywhere and skin is also not removed.
** Stenström technique of anterior abrasion: the abrasion (roughening or scoring) of the anterior (front) surface of the anti helical fold cartilage causes the cartilage to bend away from the abraded side (per the Gibson principle), towards the side of intact perichondrium, the membrane of fibrous connective tissue.
** Full-thickness incisions: one full-thickness incision along the desired curvature of the antihelix permits folding it with slight force, thereby creating an antihelical fold (as in the Luckett procedure). Yet, because such a fold is sharp and unnatural in appearance, the technique was modified as the Converse–Wood-Smith technique, wherein two incisions are made, running parallel to the desired antihelical fold, and tubing sutures are emplaced to create a more defined fold of natural contour and appearance.
* Conchal alteration
** Suturing: the surgeon decreases the angle (-25 degrees) between the concha and the mastoid process of the head with sutures emplaced between the concha and the mastoid fascia.
** Conchal excision: from either an anterior or a posterior approach, the surgeon removes a full-thickness crescent of cartilage from the posterior wall of the concha (ascertaining to neither violate nor deform the antihelical fold), to thereby reduce the height of the concha. Moreover, to avoid producing a noticeable surgical scar in the concha, the surgeon meticulously closes the conchal defect with sutures. The design of the cartilage-crescent excision means to produce a closing incision will lay at the junction of the conchal floor and the posterior conchal wall — where it is least noticeable, and causes minimal distortion of the normal contours of the ear.
** Combination of suturing and conchal excision: the surgeon applies a corrective technique that combines the pertinent technical aspects of the Furnas suture technique and of the conchal excision techniques.
** Medialisation of the conchal part of the antihelix: with this method, the antihelix is moved in the direction of the ear canal entrance with the fingers and fixed in this position by mattress sutures. Thus, a large cavum conchae is reduced without any excision of cartilage and the ear moves towards the head to the desired degree.

====Correction of earlobe prominence====
Repositioning the earlobe is the most difficult part of the otoplasty, because when an auricle that has been repositioned in its upper two-thirds, and that yet retains a prominent lobule (earlobe) will appear disproportionate to and malpositioned upon the head — as it did in the original, uncorrected deformity. The otoplastic technique most effective for lobular repositioning is the Gosain technique (or a variant), wherein the surgeon cuts the skin on the medial surface of the earlobe, and, in suturing it closed, takes a bite of the conchal undersurface to pull the earlobe towards the head.

Another prominent-earlobe correction technique is suturing the helical-cartilage tail to the concha, yet, because the tail of the helix does not extend much into the lobule, setting it back does not reliably correct the set back of the earlobe proper; other techniques involve skin excision and sutures, between the fibrofatty tissue of the lobule and the tissues of the neck.

====Alteration of the position of the auricular upper pole====
Depending upon the pre-surgical degree of prominence of the upper-third of the auricle, the surgical creation of the antihelical fold might be inadequate to fully correct the position of the helical rim, near the root of the helix.

===Types of otoplastic correction===
* Ear augmentation, addressing microtia (underdeveloped auricle) and anotia (absent auricle) involves adding structural elements to replace the missing structures. The cartilage tissue grafts for such extensive reconstructions usually are harvested either from the ear (auricular cartilage) or from the rib cage (costal cartilage).
* Ear pinback — An otopexy that &quot;flattens&quot; protuberant ears against the head (), wherein the surgeon makes an incision to the natural crease behind (retroauricular sulcus) the external ear, and cuts a small tunnel along the front of the poorly folded antihelix. Once the cartilage is loosened, the concha (bowl) is moved closer to the head, after removing the excess skin and cartilage from the ear rim, and is sutured to reshape the antihelical fold, to balance the ear lobe (lobule) with the proportions of the auricle. The corrected ear then is emplaced and sutured closer to the head. Surgical ear pinback can be performed upon an anesthetized patient (local or general anesthesia), and usually is performed as an outpatient procedure that allows the patient to convalesce at home. The post-operative bruising and swelling usually subside within two weeks, and the narrow, surgical scars are hidden in the posterior skin folds of the ear; yet the outcome is not fully noticeable until the swelling and bruising have gone. Historically, otopexy dates from 1881, when Edward Talbott Ely first performed ear pinback plastic surgery at the Eye, Ear, and Throat Hospital, Manhattan, New York City.
* Ear reduction, addressing macrotia, might involve reducing one or more of the components of oversized ears; the incisions usually are hidden in, or near, the front folds of the auricle.

===Post-surgical recovery===
The internal sutures usually are permanent (non-absorbable), but the surgical wound or wounds can be sutured with either absorbable sutures or with non-absorbable sutures that the plastic surgeon removes when the surgical wound has healed. Depending upon the deformity to be corrected, the otoplasty can be performed either as an outpatient surgery or at hospital; while the operating room time varies between 1.5 and 5 hours.

For several days after the surgery, the otoplasty patient wears a voluminous, non-compressive dressing upon the corrected ear(s), and must avoid excessive bandage pressure upon the ear during the convalescent period, lest it cause pain and increased swelling, which might lead to the abrasion, or even to the necrosis of the ear&#x27;s skin. After removing the dressing, the patient then wears a loose headband whilst sleeping for a 3–6-week period; it should be snug, not tight, because its purpose is preventing the corrected ear(s) from being pulled forward, when the sleeping patient moves whilst asleep. An overly-tight headband can abrade and erode the side surface of the ear, possibly creating an open wound. A dressing does not have to be worn if the patient was operated upon with the stitch method.

===Complications===
* Hematoma: a hematoma can be immediately addressed if the patient complains of excessive pain, or when the surgical wound bleeds. The dressing is immediately removed from the ear to ascertain the existence of a hematoma, which then is immediately evacuated. If the surgical wound is infected, antibiotic therapy helps avoid the occurrence either of abscess or of perichondritis (inflammation).
* Infection: cellulitis is rare after otoplasty, but it is treated aggressively, with antibiotics in order to avoid chondritis, a condition potentially requiring debridement, and which may permanently disfigure the ear.
* Suture complications: suture extrusion in the retroauricular sulcus (the groove behind the ear) is the most common otoplastic complication following corrective surgery. Such extruded sutures are easy to remove, but the extrusion occurrence might be associated with granulomas, which are painful and unattractive. This complication might be avoided by using absorbable sutures; to which effect, monofilament sutures are likelier to protrude, but have a lesser incidence rate of granulomas, whereas braided sutures are unlikely to protrude, but have a greater incidence rate of granulomas.
* Overcorrection and unnatural contour: the most common, but significant, complication of otoplasty is overcorrection, which can be minimized by the surgeon&#x27;s detailed attention to the functional principles of the surgical technique employed. Hence, function over form minimizes the creation of the unnatural contours characteristic of the &quot;technically perfect ear&quot;.

== Non-surgical otoplasty ==

===Indications===
====Incidence of ear deformity====
Approximately 20–30 per cent of newborn children are born with deformities of the external ear (auricle) that can occur either &quot;in utero&quot; (congenitally) or in the birth canal (acquired). The possible defects and deformities include protuberant ears (&quot;bat ears&quot;); pointed ears (&quot;elfin ears&quot;); helical rim deformity, wherein the superior portion of the ear lacks curvature; cauliflower ear, which appears as if crushed; lop ear, wherein the upper portion of the auricle is folded onto itself; and others. Such deformities usually are self-correcting, but, if at 1 week of age, the child&#x27;s external ear deformity has not self-corrected, then either surgical correction (otoplasty 5–6 years of age) or non-surgical correction (tissue molding) is required to achieve an ear of normal proportions, contour, and appearance.

===Tissue molding===
In the early weeks of infancy, the cartilage of the infantile auricle is unusually malleable, because of the remaining maternal estrogens circulating in the organism of the child. During that biochemically privileged period, prominent ears, and related deformities, can be permanently corrected by molding the auricles (ears) to the correct shape, either by the traditional method of taping, with tape and soft dental compound (e.g. gutta-percha latex), or solely with tape; or with non-surgical tissue-molding appliances, such as custom-made, defect-specific splints designed by the physician. Therapeutically, the splint-and-adhesive-tape treatment regimen is months-long, and continues until achieving the desired outcome, or until there is no further improvement in the contour of the auricle, likewise, with the custom and commercial tissue-molding devices.

==== Taping ====
The traditional, non-surgical correction of protuberant ears is taping them to the head of the child, in order to &quot;flatten&quot; them into the normal configuration. The physician effects this immediate correction to take advantage of the maternal estrogen-induced malleability of the infantile ear cartilages during the first 6 weeks of their life. The taping approach can involve either adhesive tape and a splinting material, or only adhesive tape; the specific deformity determines the correction method. This non-surgical correction period is limited, because the extant maternal estrogens in the child&#x27;s organism diminish within 6–8 weeks; afterwards, the ear cartilages stiffen, thus, taping the ears is effective only for correcting &quot;bat ears&quot; (prominent ears), and not the serious deformities that require surgical re-molding of the auricle to produce an ear of normal size, contour, and proportions. Furthermore, ear correction by splints and tape requires the regular replacement of the splints and the tape, and especial attention to the child&#x27;s head for any type of skin erosion, because of the cumulative effects of the mechanical pressures of the splints proper and the adhesive of the fastener tape.

==== Physician-designed splints ====
Congenital ear deformities are defined as either malformations (microtia, cryptotia) or deformations, wherein the term &quot;ear deformation&quot; implies a normal chondrocutaneous component with an abnormal auricular architecture. The conditions are categorized as constricted ears, Stahl&#x27;s ear deformity, and prominent ears, which derive from varied causes, such as the abnormal development and functioning of the intrinsic and extrinsic ear muscles, which might generate forces that deform the auricle; and external forces consequent to malpositioning of the head during the prenatal and neonatal periods of the child&#x27;s life. A study, &quot;Postpartum Splinting of Ear Deformities&quot; (2005), reported the efficacy of splinting the ears of a child during the early neonatal period as a safe and effective non-surgical treatment for correcting congenital ear deformities. The study used a variety of physician-designed, physician-fabricated and commercially fabricated splints, such as a wire core segment in 6-French silastic tubing, self-adhering foam, temporary stopping with dental material, dental waxes, thermoplastic materials and other commercial ear-splint devices.

<text>Bruce Farrington Coville (, born May 16, 1950) is an author of young adult fiction. Coville was first published in 1977 and has written over 100 books.

==Biography==
Coville was born on May 16, 1950, in Syracuse, New York, where he resided . Bruce Coville&#x27;s father (born Arthur Farrington) was adopted by his aunt, where he adopted her surname of Coville. Growing up in what he called &quot;farm country&quot;, Coville realized his bisexuality in his teens. While waiting to publish his first novel, Coville was employed in a number of professions including toymaker, gravedigger, cookware salesman, assembly line worker, and elementary school teacher working with second grade students and fourth grade students. Coville is wed to Katherine née Dietz (married when Coville was nineteen), and the two of them have three children: &quot;a son, Orion, born in 1970; a daughter, Cara, born in 1975; and another son, Adam, born in 1981.&quot;

==Literature==
Coville began his love of books as a child, reading &quot;Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, and zillions of comic books&quot;. He read &quot;books that made [him] laugh, but also made [him] shiver in terror.&quot; Wanting to impart those sorts of feeling to others is what spurred his love of writing. Coville knew he wanted to be a writer by his mid-teens, and by age 19 he &quot;never looked back.&quot; His first book, &quot;The Foolish Giant&quot;, a picture book illustrated by his wife, Katherine Coville, was published in 1977.

With no set paradigm for writing, Coville has successfully tried everything from writing from a strict outline to &quot;writing from the seat of my pants.&quot; , he uses what he calls an &quot;ever-expanding outline&quot; where he outlines the beginning and end of a novel, and works to fill in the middle later.

Coville has written over 100 books for young adults, with translations in over a dozen languages. He has said that even with over 100 books, it gets harder and harder to write each successive book; he&#x27;s concerned with maintaining his level of quality and not repeating himself.

Coville is also the co-founder of Full Cast Audio, an audiobook company devoted to recording full-cast, unabridged copies of young adult fiction.

===Awards===
Coville has been the recipient of three Golden Duck Awards. He won first in 1992 for the novel &quot;My Teacher Glows in the Dark&quot;, in 2000 for &quot;I Was a 6th Grade Alien&quot;, and in 2006 for producing an audio adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;.

In 2000, NESFA presented Coville with the Skylark Award for contributing significantly to science fiction, both through work in the field and by exemplifying the personal qualities which made the late &quot;Doc&quot; Smith well-loved by those who knew him.

In 2012, Coville was the 23rd recipient of the &quot;Empire State Award for Excellence in Literature for Young People&quot; as awarded by the New York Library Association.

<text>Below the Salt is the fourth studio album by Steeleye Span and their first after they joined the Chrysalis label. The album takes medieval influence and combines it with the band&#x27;s British folk rock style. The lineup on the album includes Bob Johnson and Rick Kemp making their debuts in the band. By this point, Ashley Hutchings had left the band, leaving Tim Hart and Maddy Prior as the only remaining founding members.

The album was recorded in May and June 1972 at Sound Techniques studios in Chelsea, London. Tracks were mainly chosen by Hart and Prior, but it was Johnson who suggested the band add their Christmas hit &quot;Gaudete&quot;. They self-produced the album because they could not yet find a replacement after Sandy Roberton departed.

&quot;Gaudete&quot; became the band&#x27;s first hit, reaching number 14 on the UK charts. To give the impression of the choristers approaching and then moving away, the song was given a long fade-in and -out on the album. The single release, however, featured no fade.

The album reached number 43 in the UK album charts.

It was issued on CD by Shanachie Records in 1988 (79039).

<text>Craig Robert Stadler (born June 2, 1953) is an American professional golfer who has won numerous tournaments at both the PGA Tour and Champions Tour level, including one major championship, the 1982 Masters Tournament.

==Early life==
Stadler was born in San Diego, California. His father introduced him to golf at age four, and he displayed a talent for golf early in life. Stadler attended La Jolla High School He won the 1973 U.S. Amateur, while attending the University of Southern California, where he was a teammate of future PGA Tour winners Mark Pfeil and Scott Simpson. Stadler was an All-American all four years – first-team his sophomore and junior years; second-team his freshman and senior years. Stadler finished college in 1975 and turned professional in 1976.

==Professional career==
Stadler won his first two PGA Tour events in 1980, at the Bob Hope Desert Classic and the Greater Greensboro Open. His career year was 1982 when he won four PGA Tour events including the Masters Tournament after a playoff with Dan Pohl and the World Series of Golf at the end of the year. Stadler won the money list for the only time. His next win was at the 1984 Byron Nelson Classic.

Despite playing relatively well, Stadler did not win a PGA Tour event for over 7 years (May 1984 – November 1991) during the heart of his career. During this period he recorded six runner-up performances and dozens of top-10s on the PGA Tour. He had more success at winning international tournaments. He won the 1985 Swiss Open on the European Tour and the 1987 Dunlop Phoenix Tournament on the Japan Golf Tour. He had great success at the Scandinavian Enterprise Open too, an official event on the European Tour, finishing runner-up at the 1983 and 1986 events until finally winning in 1990. His winless streak in America was broken at the final event of the 1991 season, defeating Russ Cochran in a playoff at the Tour Championship. Stadler won the B.C. Open in 2003, becoming the first player over age 50 to win a PGA Tour event in 28 years and the first player ever to win on the PGA Tour after he had won on the Champions Tour. He won 13 PGA Tour events in all, and played on the 1983 and 1985 Ryder Cup teams. In 1994 he was the featured coach for the Sega Saturn video game Pebble Beach Golf Links. In 1996 he appeared as himself in the film &quot;Tin Cup&quot;.

Stadler began playing on the Champions Tour upon becoming eligible in June 2003. His greatest successes came during his first two years of eligibility; he was the leading money winner in his first full year on that tour in 2004. Stadler underwent total left-hip-replacement surgery in Los Angeles on September 15, 2010, which limits his playing time. Stadler announced that the 2014 Masters Tournament, his 38th and in which he played with Kevin, was his last.

==Personal life==
Very popular with the galleries, Stadler is affectionately called &quot;The Walrus&quot; for his portly build and ample mustache. He lives in Denver, Colorado. His son Kevin is also a PGA Tour champion. Stadler and his son Kevin are the only father and son who have both won on both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. Stadler&#x27;s brother Gary Stadler is a Billboard-charting recording artist.

In 1984, United Airlines held a promotion for its frequent flyer members in which any member who flew the airline to all 50 states in the United States in a 50-day period would receive free first-class flights for one year. Stadler was one of 78 people who completed the challenge.

<doc id="1261752" wikidata="Q4668358" url="?curid=1261752" title="Aboriginal Voices Radio Network">
<text>Aboriginal Voices Radio Network (rebranded as Voices Radio in 2014) was a Canadian radio network, which primarily broadcast music programming and other content of interest to aboriginal people. As of June 2015, the network operated stations in Toronto, Ontario (where its studios and offices were located), Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, and Vancouver, British Columbia. All of its stations were licensed as rebroadcasters of its flagship station, CKAV-FM in Toronto. The network&#x27;s administrative office was located in Ohsweken, Ontario, on the Six Nations Indian reserve near Brantford. The stations&#x27; music programming consisted mainly of adult contemporary music (including both mainstream and indigenous artists), along with specialty programs focusing on aboriginal-oriented content.

On June 25, 2015, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revoked Voices Radio&#x27;s broadcast licences effective July 25, 2015, citing a long-term history of non-compliance with conditions of their licences. The CRTC issued a call for applications for new radio services in the markets vacated by the network, with special priority given to new First Nations services. The suspension was stayed on July 23, 2015, by the Federal Court of Appeal, pending the outcome of a request for a leave to appeal the CRTC&#x27;s decision. The stay was lifted on November 10, 2016, when AVR lost its appeal and the network left the air shortly afterwards.

==History==
Aboriginal Voices Radio Network (AVR) was founded in 1998 by a group of high-profile aboriginal Canadians, including actor Gary Farmer, playwright, novelist and author Tomson Highway, filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin and actress/producer Jennifer Podemski. The brand descended from &quot;Aboriginal Voices&quot; magazine, edited by Farmer, which published from 1993 to 1999, and Aboriginal Voices Festival which ran annually in Toronto from 1998 to 2000. Other founders and key contributors to creation of the network included project manager and training coordinator Brian Wright-McLeod, Christopher Spence and Andre Morriseau (production and programming), John Matthews and Mark MacLeod (licensing), Robert Templeton and J. Robert Wood (corporate funding), Elaine Bomberry, David Deleary, Sherman Maness, Nicole Robertson, Minnie Two Shoes and Doug Bingley (strategic advice). The network&#x27;s original scope was to feature programming produced primarily by and for Aboriginal people in Canada, featuring music and personalities from around the world.

AVR&#x27;s first station, CFIE-FM in Toronto, was licensed by the CRTC in 2000. CFIE changed its callsign to CKAV in 2006. AVR had previously operated on 106.3 FM (JUMP FM) for a short 6 day period in 1998 during the Aboriginal Voices Festival at Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. The network faced technical and logistical problems which have prevented it from launching some of its stations; and the original found here and management were forced out by 2004. The network had applied to the CRTC for extensions five or six times as of the end of 2005. Since then, however, the network had moved forward with most of the approved licenses.

In 2009, the network surrendered its licenses for transmitters in Kitchener, Ontario (CKAV-FM-8, 102.5 MHz) and Montreal (CKAV-FM-10, 106.7 MHz). On August 20, 2009, the CRTC approved an application by Canadian Hellenic Cable Radio (CHCR) to amend the broadcasting licence for its station in Montreal at 106.3 MHz, a second adjacent frequency to CKAV-FM-10 at 106.7 FM, requiring AVR to find an alternative frequency in the event of any interference with the signal of CKAV-FM-10. As of January 2011, CHCR&#x27;s station, CKIN-FM, has signed on at 106.3 MHz. Another broadcaster, Evanov Communications, has since filed an application for a new station at 106.7 serving the western suburb of Hudson in January 2012; that station, since becoming CHSV-FM, was approved in October 2012.

AVR&#x27;s outlet in Ottawa, CKAV-FM-9 95.7 MHz was on air until early October 2014, but has been silent since that time. It never returned to air, though it was still listed on its website among the other stations broadcasting.

In December 2014, AVR renamed itself to Voices Radio, as its scope expanded out of the aboriginal realm and more into music from mainstream artists, generally bent towards adult contemporary. In February 2015, Voices Radio began to air old-time radio programs from the United States, nightly from 10 pm to 12 Midnight local time.

===Loss of broadcast licensing===
On March 11, 2015, Voices Radio applied with the CRTC to renew all five station licences (including the closed Ottawa outlet), which were to expire on August 31, 2015. On June 25, 2015, the CRTC denied the renewals, revoked their broadcast licenses, and ordered Voices Radio to cease broadcasting by July 25, 2015. The commission cited repeated, long-term failures by Voices Radio to adhere to the requirements of its licenses, such as a failure to broadcast a sufficient amount of local news content in each of its markets that reflects stories of interest to their respective aboriginal communities, and failing to submit annual financial and business reports, program logs, and tapes of broadcast days to the CRTC. The CRTC intends to hold a call for applications for new aboriginal-focused broadcasters to take on CKAV&#x27;s frequencies. The CRTC&#x27;s suspension of license in all the network&#x27;s cities, except for Ottawa, was suspended on July 23, 2015, pending an application by the station for a leave to appeal the CRTC&#x27;s decision. The appeal was heard on November 8, 2016 and on November 10, the Federal Court of Appeal issued a ruling upholding the CRTC&#x27;s revocation of AVR&#x27;s licence.

===Successors===
In August 2015, the CRTC issued a call for new licenses to replace Voices Radio in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa. On February 23, 2016, the CRTC announced that they had received twelve applications for the new stations: two applications for stations in Vancouver, three for Calgary, three for Edmonton, two for Toronto and two for Ottawa. The five organizations that applied were the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society (owner of Alberta&#x27;s CFWE radio network), Wawatay Native Communications Society, Northern Native Broadcasting (Terrace), VMS Media Group, and First Peoples Radio—a subsidiary of the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network).

The licenses for Voices Radio remained in effect, pending results of their appeal, though the CRTC subsequently announced that Voices Radio&#x27;s outlets in Calgary and Edmonton had ceased operations, leaving Toronto and Vancouver as being the only stations in the Voices Radio group still broadcasting as of February 2016.

First Peoples Radio was granted licenses to operate stations in Toronto (CFPT-FM) and Ottawa (CFPO-FM) on AVR&#x27;s former frequencies. Northern Native Broadcasting (Terrace) was awarded AVR&#x27;s former Vancouver frequency and would broadcast as CKUR-FM, and AVR&#x27;s former frequencies in Edmonton and Calgary were awarded to the Aboriginal Multi-Media Society. The new Calgary station, CJWE-FM, signed on in June 2018 with a similar format to CFWE; CIWE-FM Edmonton began full broadcasting in February 2021.

==Stations==
These four stations were on the air at the time of their license revocation:

*Toronto - CKAV-FM 106.5 MHz 
*Vancouver - CKAV-FM-2, 106.3 MHz 
*Calgary - CKAV-FM-3 88.1 MHz &quot;(ceased operation prior to license revocation)&quot; 
*Edmonton - CKAV-FM-4 89.3 MHz &quot;(ceased operation prior to license revocation)&quot; 

===Ceased operation prior to 2015===
*Kitchener - CKAV-FM-8, 102.5 MHz &quot;(on-air from 2008-2009)&quot; 
*Ottawa - CKAV-FM-9, 95.7 MHz &quot;(on-air 2008-2014)&quot;
*Montreal - CKAV-FM-10, 106.7 MHz &quot;(on-air from 2008-2009)&quot;. In 2003, the station previously applied for 100.1 MHz, but was denied that frequency, due to new station CJEB-FM in Trois-Rivières being awarded the frequency.

===Licensed but never launched===
Both stations were approved by the CRTC in May 2007 and slated for launch in 2009, but never commenced broadcasting. As of 2022, these frequencies remain unoccupied.
*Regina - 96.1 MHz 
*Saskatoon - 102.9 MHz 

In 2003, Aboriginal Voices Radio was also approved to broadcast on 850 kHz in Abbotsford, British Columbia, following the conversion of Rogers Communications&#x27; CKSR to 107.1 MHz. That station never signed on, and the 850 AM frequency remains vacant.

<doc id="1261758" wikidata="Q314755" url="?curid=1261758" title="Lauren (Cameroonian footballer)">
<text>Laureano Bisan-Etame Mayer (born 19 January 1977), commonly known as Lauren, is a Cameroonian former footballer who played as a right-back. As an Arsenal player he won several trophies and is known as one of &#x27;The Invincibles&#x27;, a title given to the Arsenal squad in 2004 after they went undefeated in the 2003–04 season and won the Premier League title. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and two Africa Cup of Nations titles in 2000 and 2002 with Cameroon. He holds dual Cameroonian-Spanish nationality due to being raised in Spain.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lauren was born in Kribi, Cameroon, as his parents fled Equatorial Guinea due to the political persecution during the dictatorship of Francisco Macías Nguema. Then the family moved to Seville, Spain, where he was raised. He started his career in Spain playing for Utrera on loan from Sevilla, San Fernando, Sevilla, Levante, and Mallorca. He played the Cup Winners Cup with Mallorca against Lazio, and classified Mallorca to the Champions League. He received important offers (Real Madrid, Roma...), but he chose Arsenal.

===Arsenal===
After a transfer to Italian club Roma fell through, he moved to English club Arsenal in 2000. He made his Arsenal debut as a substitute against Sunderland on 19 August 2000 and scored his first goal for the club just two days later against Liverpool. However his first season was blighted by injuries. Although at first Lauren was unable to gain a regular place in the Arsenal side, he eventually ended up becoming the club&#x27;s first-choice right-back, replacing Lee Dixon and leapfrogging Oleh Luzhnyi in the process. By the time Arsenal had won the Double in 2001–02, Lauren was an integral part of the Arsenal defence. Lauren missed part of the season as he went off to play in the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations, but returned to feature for Arsenal from February onwards. He scored the winning goal, a penalty, against rivals Tottenham Hotspur as Arsenal closed in on the title.

In 2002–03, Lauren suffered a calf injury and again missed part of the season, but nevertheless recovered in time and won an FA Cup medal that season, as Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0.

Lauren was a consistent member of the Arsenal first team during 2003–04 and a became known as one of the &#x27;Invincibles&#x27; after the club went the whole season unbeaten. Lauren made his 150th appearance for Arsenal during the record-breaking run and Arsenal won the Premier League title, giving Lauren his second League winners&#x27; medal. His season was, however, slightly marred by his verbal abuse towards Ruud van Nistelrooy after the latter had missed a penalty late on in a draw between Arsenal and Manchester United at Old Trafford. Lauren was banned by the Football Association for four matches and fined £40,000.

Lauren won a third FA Cup winners&#x27; medal in 2005, as Arsenal beat Manchester United on penalties after a 0–0 draw in the final; Lauren scored the first of Arsenal&#x27;s spot-kicks. However, during 2005–06, Lauren suffered a knee injury against Wigan Athletic in a League Cup semi-final match on 24 January 2006. He spent nearly a year out of the game as a result, and it was not until 19 December that Lauren was included in a playing squad, for Arsenal&#x27;s match against Liverpool in the League Cup quarter-finals; this match was later postponed due to heavy fog. Lauren was not called up for Arsenal again.

During his absence, Lauren&#x27;s position had been covered by, amongst others, Emmanuel Eboué and Justin Hoyte, leading to media speculation that Lauren would leave Arsenal for West Ham United. On 12 January 2007, Wenger confirmed Arsenal would allow Lauren to leave, if he chose to do so. On 18 January 2007, Lauren joined Portsmouth on a -year contract for an undisclosed fee.

===Portsmouth===
On 18 January 2007, Lauren completed a transfer to Portsmouth on a -year contract. On 22 January, Harry Redknapp announced the transfer fee was £500,000.

Lauren made his debut on 20 January 2007 against Charlton Athletic and was a regular at right-back for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. In the 2007–08 season, he dropped to second-choice right-back due to Glen Johnson&#x27;s impressive form. However, Lauren found first team opportunities due to his versatility and filled in at left-back on many occasions and played regularly on the right of midfield during January 2008 while John Utaka was away at the African Cup of Nations. Lauren was part of Portsmouth&#x27;s 2007–08 FA Cup-winning team. Despite not making the squad for the final he appeared in the earlier rounds. In June 2009, his contract ended and he was released from the club having made just one appearance all season, as a substitute in the 2008 FA Community Shield.

===Córdoba===
On 15 March 2010, Córdoba announced that they had signed Lauren as a free agent. He made his league debut as a substitute for Arteaga on 3 April 2010 in a 0–0 away draw against Huesca. Lauren retired at the end of the season.

== International career ==
Lauren has said he feels Spanish, but chose to represent Cameroon, the nation of his birth. With Cameroon he won the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the Africa Cup of Nations title in 2000. 

This success was repeated when the team won the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations; Cameroon beat Senegal on penalties after a 0–0 draw. Lauren scored in the penalty shootout. 

Lauren made his international debut for Cameroon in 1998 and went on to earn a total of 25 caps, which yielded two goals, whilst he won Olympic Gold at the 2000 Games in Sydney and also lifted the Africa Cup of Nations in 2000 and 2002. He was part of the Indomitable Lions&#x27; squad at the France 1998 World Cup and the 2002 edition, held in Japan and Korea. Lauren announced his retirement from international football at the age of 25.

== Arsenal legend ==
Following the success he enjoyed at Arsenal, the north London outfit regard Lauren, who was a mainstay of the Invincibles side, as a club legend. He is a regular visitor to the Emirates Stadium and has lined up for the Arsenal Legends in charity matches organised by the club&#x27;s foundation, such as the double-header against Real Madrid Legends played at the Emirates and the Santiago Bernabéu in the summer of 2018. 

== Arsenal ambassador ==
Thanks to his career achievements at Arsenal and within the African game, which include two Africa Cup of Nations crowns and an Olympic Gold with Cameroon, Lauren currently serves as an Arsenal ambassador for the African continent, a role which features activities involving football and education, as well as attending gatherings with the club&#x27;s supporters. Lauren considers this position to be a real honour as he sees it as a means of helping the African people, whilst repaying some of the support he received during his playing days. One of the countries Lauren has visited is Rwanda, where he took part in children&#x27;s football and educational clinics, whilst he also acted as a club representative at official events with local authorities and explored the country&#x27;s most iconic landmarks whilst flying the flag for Arsenal. 

Lauren&#x27;s role as an Arsenal ambassador has also seen him travel to other global destinations, including Singapore, where he was again involved in football clinics and represented the club at various events.

== FIFA technical expert ==
Lauren was appointed as a FIFA technical expert for talent development. Within his role, he will be tasked with enhancing the competitive standards of African football on the international stage and is able to call on the vast experience acquired during a playing career that saw him earn legendary status with Arsenal and the Cameroon national team.

== TV commentator ==
Lauren is a well-respected voice of authority when it comes to match broadcasts. He regularly features on LaLiga TV&#x27;s English-language Viva LaLiga show, which reviews all of the latest action from the Spanish top flight. Meanwhile, he has also worked as a studio pundit for GOL TV&#x27;s coverage of major Arsenal matches, such as the 2018/19 Europa League final against Chelsea. He has also made media appearances for leading broadcasters, including Sky Sports, where he has featured on Guillem Balagué&#x27;s Revista de La Liga show, and BBC Sport. He was part of ITV and Eurosport broadcasting teams for the 2012 and 2017 editions of the Africa Cup of Nations.

== Personal life ==
He is also an avid boxer and enjoys sparring in his spare time. He lives in Seville, and has two children.

<text>Les Têtes Brulées () are a Cameroonian band known for a pop version of the bikutsi dance music. Their name literally means &quot;the burnt heads&quot; in French, but more likely is meant to imply &quot;mindblown&quot; or &quot;hotheads,&quot; although founder Jean-Marie Ahanda prefers the translation &quot;&quot;burnt minds&quot;.&quot; 

==About==
&quot;Les Têtes Brulées&quot; first rose to prominence in the 1980s, and quickly became the world&#x27;s most famous bikutsi band. However, many critics and fans of the genre did not like their aggressively electrified sound, and the band saw some criticism. They became known for their distinctive costumes, shaved heads and brightly painted bodies, which were meant to evoke traditional Beti scarification.

The band was formed by Jean-Marie Ahanda, and included the guitarist Zanzibar, who remains well known for innovative attachment of foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar, which made the instrument sound like a traditional balafon. Zanzibar&#x27;s death in 1988 threatened to end the band&#x27;s future, but they continued performing and recording. Their first LP was &quot;Hot Heads&quot;, which was also the first full-length recording of bikutsi, and contained lyrics which addressed social issues. The band toured across Africa, Europe, the United States and Japan; some footage of this tour was used in Claire Denis&#x27; film &quot;Man No Run&quot;. Later, they accompanied the Cameroonian soccer team to a match in Italy, which brought the band many new fans.

<text>The Estonian Football Association (EJL; ) is the governing body of football, beach soccer and futsal in Estonia. Established on 14 December 1921, it organizes the football league, including the championship which is called Meistriliiga, Estonian Cup and the Estonian national football team. It is based in Tallinn. EJL became a member of FIFA in 1923 but was disbanded during the occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union; during this time the Estonian SSR Football Federation () organized Estonian football. It became a member of FIFA once again in 1992, following Estonia regaining its independence.

==Controversy==
In 2017, FIFA fined the Estonian Football Association 30,000 Swiss francs (26,000 euros) and gave them a warning because of an incident where Bosnia and Herzegovina fans threw burning material onto the field.

<doc id="1261767" wikidata="Q1164349" url="?curid=1261767" title="Chlorophytum comosum">
<text>Chlorophytum comosum, usually called spider plant or common spider plant due to its spider-like look, also known as spider ivy, airplane plant, ribbon plant (a name it shares with &quot;Dracaena sanderiana&quot;), and hen and chickens, is a species of evergreen perennial flowering plant of the family Asparagaceae. It is native to tropical and Southern Africa but has become naturalized in other parts of the world, including Western Australia and Bangladesh. &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; is easy to grow as a houseplant because of its resilience, but it can be sensitive to the fluoride in tap water, which commonly gives it &quot;burnt tips&quot;. Variegated forms are the most popular.

== Description ==
&quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; grows to about tall, although as a hanging plant it can descend many feet. It has fleshy, tuberous roots, each about long. The long narrow leaves reach a length of and are around wide.
Flowers are produced in a long, branched inflorescence, which can reach a length of up to and eventually bends downward to meet the earth. Flowers initially occur in clusters of 1–6 at intervals along the stem (scape) of the inflorescence. Each cluster is at the base of a bract, which ranges from in length, becoming smaller toward the end of the inflorescence. Most of the flowers that are produced initially die off, so that relatively, the inflorescences are sparsely flowered.

Individual flowers are greenish-white, borne on stalks (pedicels) some long. Each flower has six triply veined tepals that are long and slightly hooded or boat-shaped at their tips. The stamens consist of a pollen-producing anther about long with a filament of similar length or slightly longer. The central style is long. Seeds are produced in a capsule, long, on stalks (pedicels) that lengthen to up to .

The inflorescences carry not only flowers but also vegetative plantlets at the tips of their branches, which eventually droop and touch the soil, developing adventitious roots. The stems (scapes) of the inflorescence are called &quot;stolons&quot; in some sources, but this term is more correctly used for stems that do not bear flowers and have roots at the nodes.

== Taxonomy ==
The first formal description of &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg as &quot;Anthericum comosum&quot; in the 1794 volume of &quot;Prodromus Plantarum Capensium&quot;, Thunberg&#x27;s work on the plants of South Africa. The species was subsequently moved to a number of different genera, including &quot;Phalangium&quot;, &quot;Caesia&quot;, &quot;Hartwegia&quot; , and &quot;Hollia&quot;, before receiving its current placement in &quot;Chlorophytum&quot; by Jacques in 1862.

The species has been confused with &quot;Chlorophytum capense&quot; by some authors, but this is a different species.

=== Intra-specific variation ===

There are three described varieties of the species: the autonym &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;comosum&quot; has strap-shaped narrow leaves and is found along forest margins; &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;bipindense&quot; has broader, petiolate leaves with stripes on the underside and the inflorescences are 2–3 times the length of the leaves; and &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;sparsiflorum&quot; also has broader leaves that narrow to the base, and usually lacks a petiole and the striping on the underside of the leaf and the inflorescences are up to two times the length of the leaves. The latter two are rainforest-dwelling taxa that had been described earlier as separate species, but botanists Axel Dalberg Poulsen and Inger Nordal reduced the taxa to varieties of &quot;C. comosum&quot; in 2005.

Delimitation of species boundaries within the genus &quot;Chlorophytum&quot; is reported to be difficult, possibly because of several evolutionary radiations into forest environments that led to morphological aspects that are too similar to reliably distinguish separate species. The evidence given to support this is the widespread distribution of most taxa in the genus and poor seed dispersal, leading to the conclusion of deeper evolutionary divergence among the taxa. 

The three described varieties in &quot;C. comosum&quot; could be an example of this convergent evolution of leaf shape among the forest-dwelling varieties from species of disparate origin, leading to the species &quot;C. comosum&quot; being polyphyletic, instead of the traditional view of morphological divergence among the varieties within the species with the assumption of a common origin (monophyly). The widespread &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;comosum&quot; has slender, near linear leaves that lack a petiole similar to plants found in cultivation and is only found growing at the margins of the rainforest. The two other varieties, &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;sparsiflorum&quot; and &quot;C. comosum&quot; var. &quot;bipindense&quot;, possess petioles and have broader leaves necessary for collecting more light in the shady Guineo-Congolean rainforest. A study published in 2005 used 16 morphological characters and was unable to delimit species boundaries among these three taxa, so they were relegated to varietal status. A follow-up study published in 2008 provided preliminary evidence from phylogenetic analysis of plastid and nuclear DNA sequences that established samples from disparate collections sites identified as &quot;C. comosum&quot; were polyphyletic.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; has a widespread native distribution in Africa, being native to six of the ten World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions regions of Africa (West Tropical Africa, West-Central Tropical Africa, Northeast Tropical Africa, East Tropical Africa, South Tropical Africa, and Southern Africa).

== Cultivation ==
&quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; is a popular houseplant. The species with all-green leaves forms only a small proportion of plants sold. More common are two variegated cultivars:

* &quot;C. comosum&quot; &#x27;Vittatum&#x27; has mid-green leaves with a broad central white stripe. It is often sold in hanging baskets to display the plantlets. The long stems are white. There is also a &quot;curly&quot; version with this type of striping and compact size. 
* &quot;C. comosum&quot; &#x27;Variegatum&#x27; has darker green leaves with white margins. It is generally smaller than the previous cultivar. The long stems are green.
Both cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).
In 2021, 17 other cultivars were listed, including &#x27;Bonnie&#x27;, &#x27;Green Bonnie&#x27; and &#x27;Hawaiian&#x27;.

=== Propagation ===
Propagating &quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot; commonly occurs through potting the plantlets, informally referred to as &#x27;spiderettes&#x27;, or &#x27;pups&#x27;, directly into potting soil, or pumice, attached to the main plant or cutting the running stems and then potting them.

Spider plants are easy to grow, being able to thrive in a wide range of conditions. They will tolerate temperatures down to , but grow best at temperatures between and . Plants can be damaged by high fluoride or boron levels.

== Toxicity and effects on pets ==
Spider plants are non-toxic to humans and pets, and are considered edible.

== Air purification ==
The NASA Clean Air Study suggested that air plants were effective at removing common household air toxins formaldehyde and xylene; however, these results are not applicable to typical buildings, where outdoor-to-indoor air exchange already removes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at a rate that could only be matched by the placement of 10–1000 plants/m of a building&#x27;s floor space.

The results also failed to replicate in future studies, with a 2014 review stating that:

In the laboratory settings uses in the Clean Air Study, spider plants were shown to reduce formaldehyde pollution, and approximately 70 plants would neutralize the formaldehyde released by materials in a representative (c. ) energy-efficient house, assuming each plant occupies a pot.
==Edibility==
The tuberous roots are reportedly edible (whether raw or cooked unstated) although mild laxative effects are claimed by the Nguni people of its native South Africa.

<text>Supreme Soviet of the National Economy, Superior Soviet of the People&#x27;s Economy, (Высший совет народного хозяйства, ВСНХ, &quot;Vysshiy sovet narodnogo khozyaystva&quot;, VSNKh) was the superior state institution for management of the economy of the RSFSR and later of the Soviet Union. There were two institutions with this name, at different times, 1917–1932 and 1963–1965.

==1917–1932==
The VSNKh of the first period was the supreme organ of the management of the economy, mainly of the industry.

===Foundation===
The VSNKh was launched on December 5, 1917, through a decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom) and All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. Its stated purpose was to &quot;plan for the organization of the economic life of the country and the financial resources of the government&quot;. It was subordinated to the Sovnarkom. The recently established All-Russian Council for Workers&#x27; Control was dissolved into the new organisation. It had rights of confiscation and expropriation. The first chairman was Valerian Osinsky and with Bukharin, Georgy Oppokov (Lomov), Milyutin, Sokolnikov, and Vasili Schmidt also appointed to the council.

===Reorganisation===
After the creation of the Soviet Union in 1923 it was transformed into the joint all-Union and republican People&#x27;s Commissariat. In 1932, it was reorganized into three People&#x27;s Commissariats: of heavy industry, light industry and forestry.

In each of the union republics of the Soviet Union, subordinate organisations existed. These were referred to as &quot;ВСНХ&quot; followed by their union republic acronym. (for example &quot;ВСНХ БССР&quot; (VSNKh BSSR) for the Belarusian SSR). The all-union council could be referred to as &quot;ВСНХ СССР&quot; (VSNKh SSSR). The republican VSNKhs had control over small scale, minor industries which used local materials and supplied local markets and which were referred to as &quot;enterprises of republican subordination&quot;. Large scale industrial enterprises (&quot;enterprises of union subordination&quot;) were controlled by one of the industrial sector departments of the all-union VSNKh.

===Organisational structure===
Within the VSNKh, departments were split into two types.

====Functional sector departments====
Departments within the functional sector dealt with decisions relating to finance, planning, economic policy, and research and development.

====Industrial sector departments====
Departments of this type were created by decree in 1926 and consisted of &quot;chief departments&quot;, known as &quot;glavki&quot; (&quot;glavnye upravlenija&quot;).

Heads of all the departments in this sector formed the council of the all-union &quot;VSNKh&quot; together with representatives from the union republics.

====Heads of the VSNKh====
* Valerian Osinsky (1917–1918)
* Alexei Rykov (1918–1920)
* Felix Dzerzhinsky (1924–1926)
* Valerian Kuibyshev (1926–1930)
* Sergo Ordzhonikidze (1930–1932)

==1963–1965==
Vesenkha was reestablished by Nikita Khrushchev when he introduced decentralization of the management of industry by means of sovnarkhozes. It was subordinated to the Council of Ministers of the USSR and managed industry and construction.

Sovnarkhozes were introduced by Nikita Khrushchev in July 1957 in an attempt to combat the centralization and departmentalism of ministries. The USSR was initially divided into 105 economic regions, with sovharknozes being operational and planning management. Simultaneously, a large number of ministries were shut down.

<doc id="1261775" wikidata="Q6763602" url="?curid=1261775" title="Marilyn Mushinski">
<text>Marilyn Mushinski (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was an alderman (councillor) for the city of Scarborough, Ontario from 1982 to 1994 and she served as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003. From 1995 to 1997 she was a cabinet minister under Mike Harris.

==Background==
Born in England, Mushinski emigrated to Canada in 1967 at age twenty-one, and was educated at York University. She worked with the Canadian Mental Health Association before entering political life.

She was married to Paul Mushinski JP, but are now divorced.

==Politics==

===Municipal===
She served as an alderman and councillor in Scarborough, Ontario from 1982 to 1994, and was also a councillor for Metro Toronto in 1987-88. Mushinski also served as a board member of the Scarborough General Hospital and the Scarborough Women&#x27;s Centre.

In 1986, Mushinski argued, albeit unsuccessfully, to retain the title &quot;alderman&quot; rather than switch to the gender neutral term &quot;councillor&quot;. She said, &quot;My gut reaction is one of dismay because I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve ever taken into consideration the historical significance of the word alderman. I think it trivializes the language and I&#x27;m concerned to have to accommodate the quirks of a feminist movement which is trying to bastardize the English language.&quot;

In 1994, she ran for mayor of Scarborough against fellow councillors Frank Faubert and Maureen Prinsloo. Mushinski&#x27;s campaign which was similar to those of her colleagues was based on freezing property taxes and increasing the police force to fight rising crime in the city. During the election, a group called the &quot;Scarborough Volunteer Citizens&#x27; Budget Advisory Committee&quot; rated the candidates. They gave Mushinski a score of 0 out of 100; Faubert was given a score of 50 out of 100. Faubert defeated Mushinski by a margin of 30,844 votes.

===Provincial===
Mushinski was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent New Democratic Party of Ontario David Warner by about 4,000 votes in the riding of Scarborough—Ellesmere. On June 26, 1995, she was named as Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Citizenship, Culture and Recreation.

In 1995, shortly after the election, Mushinski moved to repeal the employment equity law introduced by the previous NDP government. She said, &quot;legislated hiring and promotion quotas are unnecessary, unfair and ineffective.&quot;

In 1997, Mushinski issued a press release denouncing a gangland style shooting in her riding in which two Tamil men were injured. She said, &quot;The Canadian tradition of consultation, co-operation and compromise seems to be lost on these individuals. Canada&#x27;s strength lies in its long-held belief that immigrants to this country are starting fresh, and should embrace a new openness to diversity and respect for the law of the land.&quot; Scarborough Mayor Frank Faubert said the release went too far. He called the statement, &quot;a smear on the entire Tamil community.&quot;

During a cabinet shuffle later that year she was dropped from cabinet. There was some speculation that although culture was part of her portfolio she had made few friends in the arts community. In 1998 she was made Parliamentary Assistant to the Premier.

In the provincial election of 1999, Mushinski was re-elected by about 4,000 votes over Liberal candidate Costas Manios; NDP candidate and labour leader Sid Ryan was third. During this term she served as Parliamentary Assistant to both the Premier and the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.

In May 2000, Mushinski introduced a private members&#x27; bill called the &quot;Judicial Accountability Act&quot;. The bill called for the publication of judges&#x27; sentencing records. It would have created a list of sentences imposed by judges and their reasons for not awarding the maximum possible sentence. Upon introduction of the bill she said she wanted to &quot;motivate lenient judges to give out tougher sentences.&quot; She warned that judges that didn&#x27;t play along with this goal might be subject to performance reviews. The bill was opposed by the Criminal Lawyer&#x27;s Association. Alan Gold, president of the association said, &quot;It&#x27;s a blatant attack on the independence of the judiciary, it&#x27;s an attempt to intimidate judges into imposing higher sentences and that&#x27;s simply inexcusable.&quot; Attorney General Jim Flaherty initially was supportive of the bill. He said, &quot;I think the public is entitled to know what sentences are being handed down by judges.&quot; But after considerable opposition from the legal community he distanced himself from the legislation. The bill died on the order paper when the legislature recessed for the summer.

In the 2003 provincial election, she was defeated by Liberal candidate Brad Duguid by 10,012 votes.

<text>Gholām-Hossein Banān (; 5 May 1911 – 27 February 1986) was an Iranian musician and singer. One of the most prominent Iranian singers of the 20th century, he was renowned for the quality of his voice.

==Biography==
Born in Tehran, Banān descended from a prominent family &quot;with a background in government service&quot;. His father, Karim Khan Banān ol-Dowleh (son of Mohammad-Taqi Mirza Fazlollah Khan Mostowfi Nuri) was an admirer of traditional music. His mother was related to the ruling Qajar dynasty of Iran; she was the daughter of Mohammad Taqi Mirza Rokn ed-Dowleh, a brother of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1848–1896). Margaret Caton notes that Banān grew up in an environment where artistic development was fostered; his father sang and played the tar, while his mother played piano. Banān&#x27;s maternal aunt played the ney, and his sisters studied the tar with Morteza Neidavoud.

From the age of six Gholam-Hossein Banān began to take lessons in singing and playing the piano and organ through the encouragement of Morteza Neidavoud who was quick to recognize him as musically talented. Gholām-Hossein&#x27;s first teachers were his parents. He subsequently studied with Mirzā Tāher Ziā oz-Zākerin Rasā&#x27;í and Nāser Seif. Ali-Naqi Vaziri later introduced him to the acclaimed Rouhollah Khāleghi.

Banān joined the Iranian National Music Association in 1942, and appeared on Iranian National Radio that same year. He then joined the orchestra of the distinguished pianist Javād Maroufi, becoming the lead vocalist.

In 1957 or 1958, Banān became blind in his right eye following a car accident.

Banān died 7:00 pm on Thursday 27 February 1986 in Iranmehr Hospital in Gholhak, Tehran. He is still remembered by lovers of traditional Persian music. Among his best-remembered songs are &quot;Ey Iran&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Elahe-ye Naz&quot;.

<text>The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia (Nova Scotia Court of Appeal or NSCA) is the highest appeal court in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. There are currently 8 judicial seats including one assigned to the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. At any given time there may be one or more additional justices who sit as supernumerary justices.
The court sits in Halifax, which is the capital of Nova Scotia. Cases are heard by a panel of three judges. They publish approximately 80 cases each year.

==History==
The Court of Appeal was established on 30 January 1993. From 1966 to 1993, appeals pursuant to Supreme Court cases were heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and, prior to 1966, by a panel of Supreme Court judges sitting &quot;en banc&quot;. The Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal is the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. Prior to the establishment of the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice was the Chief Justice of the Appeal Division (1966–1993) and, before 1966, of the Supreme Court.

== Jurisdiction ==
The court derives its power from legislation of the Nova Scotia legislature, the &quot;Judicature Act&quot;. It hears appeals from the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Provincial Court of Nova Scotia, and various tribunals.

Only the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal; in practice this happens a few times a year.

==Judges==

<doc id="1261781" wikidata="Q6867972" url="?curid=1261781" title="Minneapolis City Council">
<text>The Minneapolis City Council is the legislative branch of the city of Minneapolis in Minnesota, United States. Comprising 13 members, the council holds the authority to create and modify laws, policies, and ordinances that govern the city. Each member represents one of the 13 wards in Minneapolis, elected for a four-year term. The current council structure has been in place since the 1950s.

In recent elections, council membership has been dominated by the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL). As of 2024, 12 members identified with the DFL, while four identified with Democratic Socialists of America (three members identify as both DFL and DSA). Until the 2021 Minneapolis municipal election, the city&#x27;s government structure was considered a weak-mayor, strong-council system. However, a strong-mayor charter amendment was passed, and since 2021, the mayor holds executive power and the council has purely legislative duties.

==History==
===Pre-charter (1850s-1920)===
The Minneapolis City Council has existed longer than the city&#x27;s home rule charter. The cities of Minneapolis and Saint Anthony incorporated in 1856 and 1855 respectively, each with councils of their own; in 1872, when the two cities merged, there were twenty aldermen, two representing each of ten council wards. By 1900, the council comprised twenty-six members, two from each of thirteen wards. 

In 1896, Minnesota adopted an amendment allowing cities more autonomy, and debates began over how to structure the government and its council. At the time, the city had a council government with a relatively weak mayor role.

The first proposal for an independent charter shifted significant power to the mayor. In 1898, voters rejected that strong-mayor proposal. Five versions tried to organize the city in several ways and failed to reach the approval of the electorate. In 1920, the city adopted the seventh attempt at a home rule charter, establishing the city council we have today.

===Home rule (1920-1999)===
Over the first thirty years of the charter&#x27;s existence, there were several failed plans to change the city council&#x27;s role and makeup. These included proposals to change to the number of representatives or to add at-large seats. In 1929, a proposal to establish a executive mayor and legislative council gained traction after council members were caught up in a stock-market fraud scandal centering Wilbur B. Foshay; it failed to win over sufficient voters to amend the charter. Attempts to give the mayor more authority failed at the ballot box several times in this period, most notably in 1988 when it failed despite the support of mayor Don Fraser. In one of the first successful charter amendments, the city council assumed its current size of 13 single-member wards in 1951. In 1983, the term for representatives was changed from alderman to council member.

The first Black city council member was Van White, elected in 1979 to represent Ward 5. The first openly gay member, Brian Coyle, was elected in 1983 to represent Ward 6 and died of AIDS while in office as council vice president.

===21st century===
====Structure and composition====
The city adopted instant-runoff voting in 2006, first using it in the 2009 elections. 

In 2013, Minneapolis elected Abdi Warsame, Alondra Cano, and Blong Yang, the city&#x27;s first Somali-American, Mexican-American, and Hmong-American city councilpeople, respectively. In 2017, Phillipe Cunningham from Ward 4 and Andrea Jenkins from Ward 8 were elected to the City Council, becoming the first openly transgender Black man and woman, respectively, to be elected to any office in the United States.

In 2021, voters approved a &quot;strong mayor&quot; amendment. This took away the city council&#x27;s executive authority, delineating the council&#x27;s role as legislative and the mayor&#x27;s role as executive.

====Major policies====
The city council passed a resolution in March 2015 making fossil fuel divestment city policy. With encouragement from city administration, Minneapolis joined seventeen cities worldwide in the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance. The city&#x27;s climate plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 15 percent in 2015 &quot;compared to 2006 levels, 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050&quot;.

In 2018, the city council passed the Minneapolis Comprehensive 2040 Plan and submitted it for Metropolitan Council approval. Watched nationally, the plan rezoned predominantly single-family residential neighborhoods for triplexes to increase affordable housing, seeking to reduce the effects of climate change, and tried to rectify some of the city&#x27;s racial disparities. After the Metropolitan Council approved the plan, in November 2019 the city council voted unanimously to allow duplexes and triplexes citywide. The Brookings Institution called it &quot;a relatively rare example of success for the YIMBY agenda&quot; and &quot;the most wonderful plan of the year.&quot; 

In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, nine city council members announced their highly controversial goals to disband the Minneapolis Police Department. Their plan included amending the city&#x27;s charter to remove the requirement for a minimum number of officers, along with replacing the MPD with a broader public safety agency. The city council was then discovered to have been utilizing private security at a cost of $4,500 per day for three of their members. The plan made it to the ballot in 2021, but ended up failing with only 43% of votes in support of it; along with six of the nine city council members who wanted to disband the police department either voted out or having not ran for reelection.

====Controversies and incidents====
In July 2001, DFL council member Brian Herron pleaded guilty to one count of felony extortion. Herron admitted to accepting a $10,000 bribe from business owner Selwin Ortega who faced numerous health and safety inspection violations at his Las Americas grocery stores. Herron served a one-year sentence in federal prison.

On November 21, 2002, ten-year DFL council member Joe Biernat was convicted of five federal felony charges, one count of embezzlement, three counts of mail fraud, and one count of making a false statement. Biernat was found not guilty on extortion and conspiracy to extort charges.

In September 2005, Green Party council member Dean Zimmermann was served with a federal search warrant to his home by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The affidavit attached to the warrant revealed that the FBI had Zimmermann on video and audiotape accepting bribes for a zoning change. Zimmermann subsequently lost his re-election campaign, and was convicted in federal court on three counts of accepting cash from a developer and found not guilty of soliciting property from people with business with the city. Zimmermann was released from prison in July 2008.

In 2009, council president Barbara A. Johnson was accused of misusing campaign funds for personal spending. An administrative hearing was held January 26, 2010. The administrative judges at the hearing dismissed six of the eight charges; it upheld two charges—that AAA services were paid for both her and her husband&#x27;s vehicle and that not all charges for hairstyling or dry cleaning were reasonably related to the campaign. Johnson paid a $200 fine for these violations, the lowest fine possible.

In 2015, DFL council member Alondra Cano used her Twitter account to publish private cellphone numbers and e-mail addresses of critics who wrote about her involvement in a Black Lives Matter rally.

In 2021, while leaving a Pride Day event, a car containing Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins was surrounded by protesters who blocked her from moving until she signed a list of demands, which included not interfering with the occupied George Floyd Square and the resignation of Mayor Jacob Frey. Jenkins was stuck for over 90 minutes before signing the list so she could depart.

In July 2022, council member Michael Rainville stated during a meeting with his constituents that he was going to go to a mosque in Northeast Minneapolis to &quot;meet with Somali elders and tell them that their children can no longer have [poor] behavior,&quot; in response to incidents on the 4th of July in downtown Minneapolis, during which groups of younger people were seen launching fireworks at buildings and passerby. His comments drew criticism, including from fellow City Council members who attempted to censure him. Jamal Osman, Jeremiah Ellison, and Aisha Chughtai, the City Council&#x27;s three Muslim members at the time, issued a statement calling Rainville&#x27;s comments &quot;incorrect,&quot; &quot;inappropriate,&quot; &quot;disturbing,&quot; and &quot;dangerous.&quot; Rainville has since apologized for the comments.

At the Minneapolis DFL caucus for Ward 10 on May 13, 2023, supporters of challenger Nasri Warsame rushed the stage when incumbent Aisha Chughtai was scheduled to speak. Chughtai claimed that over a dozen of her supporters and DFL volunteers were physically assaulted in the chaos, while Warsame claimed his campaign manager had been hospitalized due to an injury sustained by a member of the opposing campaign&#x27;s staff. Later that month, leaders of the DFL voted to permanently bar Warsame from seeking the party&#x27;s endorsement for any elected office.

In a 2025, Jerry McAfee, a local pastor who had a contract with the city as a violence interruptor, interrupted a council meeting with violent threats and homophobic insults towards council members.

==Structure==
===Electoral system===
In 2006, Minneapolis voters approved the use of the single transferable vote for its municipal elections. The first use of ranked-choice voting was in the 2009 municipal election. However, since the City Council uses single-member districts, the single transferable vote functions the same way as instant-runoff voting. This system of voting is commonly known in the United States as ranked choice voting.

Each member&#x27;s term is normally four years, and there are no limits on the number of terms a member may serve. In 2020, voters approved a plan to amend the city charter to establish city council elections in 2021 and 2023 for two-year terms instead of the regular four-year terms, with four-year term elections restarting in 2025. The amendment also granted the ability for the city to use this method whenever regular city council elections do not fall in a year ending in a 3 in order to comply with a state law designed to require city council elections in years ending in 2 or 3 after a census.

===Wards===
Each city council member represents one of 13 wards. Ward boundaries are redrawn after each census and approved by the court-appointed Charter Commission. For elections, the 13 wards are subdivided into a total of 137 precincts.

===Salary===
Council members have a base salary of $109,846 in 2024. Raises for council members and the mayor are based on &quot;averaging out the increases included in the union contracts they approved the previous year.&quot; The rate was $106,101 in 2021. In 2018, all Council Members were paid a base salary of $98,696 annually, plus mileage, free parking, and the usual employee benefits. This salary included an increase of $10,000 approved in late 2017.

==Members==
The council is made up of 13 members. The DFL holds 12 seats, while one member (Robin Wonsley) sits as an independent democratic socialist. New members took office January 2024.

<doc id="1261783" wikidata="Q3210368" url="?curid=1261783" title="Stone of Farewell">
<text>Stone of Farewell is a 1990 fantasy novel by Tad Williams, the second volume of his Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy. The saga develops the narrative started in &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; and focuses primarily on Simon, a former kitchen servant in the largest castle in the land.

==Plot summary==
The previous volume saw Simon wound a dragon with the mystical sword Thorn, splashing himself in dragon’s blood, leaving himself deeply scarred (physically and emotionally). Now bearing the sobriquet &quot;Snowlock&quot;, he and his companions leave the mountains in search of the mysterious &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot;.

Meanwhile, Josua &quot;Lackhand&quot;, brother to the king, leads a motley band of survivors after the disastrous events at Naglimund.

Princess Miriamele, having escaped before the siege of Naglimund, gets caught up in events that demonstrate the evil powers surrounding her father.

Princess Maegwin of Hernystir leads her people deep underground, where they discover secrets that may help turn the tide in a war thought to be hopeless.

Finally, a power rises in the North, but its true implications may not yet be fully revealed.

==Reception==
In &quot;Locus&quot;, Carolyn Cushman called the novel &quot;an epic fantasy you can get lost in for days, not just hours&quot;.

Kat Hooper of fantasyliterature.com gave &quot;The Stone of Farewell&quot; a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and a mixed review, calling it &quot;excessively lengthy&quot; and saying it &quot;is everything we’ve come to expect from a middle book in a well-written traditional medieval-style epic fantasy trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="1261794" wikidata="Q4812541" url="?curid=1261794" title="At the Movies (Australian TV program)">
<text>At the Movies is an Australian television program on ABC hosted by film critics Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton, where they discussed the films opening in theatres that week.

==History==
The program, which began in mid-2004, is a continuation of the pair&#x27;s earlier program &quot;The Movie Show&quot;, which aired on SBS One from 1986 to 2004. The pair left SBS after expressing dissatisfaction with high-level decisions.

The weekly half-hour program consists of film reviews and discussions as well as interviews with cast and crew members. The hosts also occasionally broadcast from film events such as the Cannes Film Festival.

The pair&#x27;s 25 years of presenting film reviews on television was celebrated in a special show on 26 October 2011, filmed before an audience and special guests, hosted by Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.

On 16 September 2014, Stratton and Pomeranz announced they would be retiring at the end of the 2014 series. The final episode aired on 9 December 2014, and Stratton and Pomeranz said farewell to over 700,000 viewers, making it one of the most-watched season finales on the ABC in the history of the station.

== 5-star films ==
Only seven films have achieved a perfect 5-star rating by both Pomeranz and Stratton.
* &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;
* &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;
* &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;
* &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;
* &quot;A Separation&quot;
* &quot;Amour&quot;
* &quot;Birdman or (the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot;

In the previous SBS format, several films achieved 5 stars from both Margaret and David, including films such as &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, &quot;Russian Ark&quot;, &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, &quot;Evil Angels&quot;, &quot;Return Home&quot;, &quot;The Piano&quot;,&quot; Lantana,&quot; and &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot;.

==In other media==
Pomeranz and Stratton both appeared in a parody of themselves and &quot;At the Movies&quot; in the fourth episode of the ABC show &quot;Lawrence Leung&#x27;s Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;. They have also appeared in the ABC shows &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, &quot;Review with Myles Barlow&quot;, &quot;Good Game&quot; and &quot;Dance Academy&quot;. Pomeranz has also appeared in recurring spoofs of the show on &quot;The Weekly with Charlie Pickering&quot;.
In December 2020, they appeared in a spoof YouTube video reviewing the year 2020.
Around 2006 Hopscotch Entertainment released a DVD &quot;Margaret &amp; David at the Movies interactive quiz&quot;, hosted by Stratton and Pomeranz, containing around 1500 film-based questions (and answers), with list of rules and scoresheet.

In 2025 Alexei Toliopoulos and Zachary Ruane will be touring a comedy stage show &quot;Refused Classification&quot; based upon Margaret and David&#x27;s historical legal battles sorounding film censorship, focusing in particular on their relation to &quot;Ken Park&quot;.

<text>Pioneer Jazz was a Malian band from the 1960s. The band emerged from the city of Bamako after Modibo Keita, the Malian leader, began subsidizing musical groups as long as they used indigenous praise song, and the kora and balafon musical instruments, in their music. Pioneer Jazz became very popular, and contributed musicians who went on to join other renowned Malian bands. Perhaps the most prominent member of Pioneer Jazz was guitarist Djelimady Tounkara, who later joined the Rail Band.</text><links>

<doc id="1261801" wikidata="Q7379272" url="?curid=1261801" title="Rumford fireplace">
<text>A Rumford fireplace, sometimes known as a Rumford stove, is a tall, shallow fireplace designed by Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, an Anglo-American physicist best known for his investigations of heat. Its shallow, angled sides are designed to reflect heat into the room, and its streamlined throat minimizes turbulence, thereby carrying away smoke with little loss of heated room air.

==History==
Rumford appears to have first developed an interest in smoking fireplaces following problems encountered following 1794 renovations of the Palmerston family&#x27;s house in Hanover Square, Westminster, Rumford being at the time in intimate correspondence with Lady Palmerston. Around the end of 1795 Rumford experimented with various designs, his first practical installation being at the Board of Trade in Whitehall. Rumford later installed such fireplaces not only at the Palmerston house, but throughout those of the aristocracy of England.

His designs made the fireplaces smaller and shallower with widely angled covings so they would radiate better. And he streamlined the throat, or in his words &quot;rounded off the breast&quot; so as to &quot;remove those local hindrances which forcibly prevent the smoke from following its natural tendency to go up the chimney...&quot;

Rumford wrote two papers detailing his improvements on fireplaces in 1796 and 1798. He was well known and widely read in his lifetime and almost immediately in the 1790s his &quot;Rumford fireplace&quot; became state-of-the-art worldwide. Subsequent testing of Rumford&#x27;s designs has shown that their efficiency would qualify them as clean-burning stoves.

==Principle of action==

The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraft. He and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and they added a choke to the chimney to create a circulation of air inside the chimney. In the unmodified chimney, smoke rises up the chimney propelled only by buoyancy—the heated gases from the fireplace being lighter than the surrounding air. This is especially ineffective when the fire is first lit, and the temperature and density of the smoke are closer to the ambient air. Thanks to the discontinuity produced by Rumford&#x27;s brick &quot;smoke shelf&quot;, the flow of smoke gases up the chimney became detached from the outside wall at the lip of the shelf. This set up a counter-circulation of outside air which flowed down the backside of the chimney, while a mixture of outside air and smoke flowed up the opposite side. The circulation inside the chimney, and above the smoke shelf, created a dynamic pressure in which the smoke gases were driven up one side of the chimney and cold air was pulled down the other. The air mixed with the rising smoke and increased the combined flow rising up the flue. It produced a circulating air-smoke flow, driving the smoke up into the chimney rather than lingering and often choking the residents. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions and became smoke-free as well as more efficient. Thompson became a celebrity when news of his success became widespread. In an age when fires were the principal source of heat, this simple alteration in the design of fireplaces was copied widely.

==Usage==

Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Count Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Existing fireplaces could be rebuilt to the Rumford design (&quot;Rumfordized&quot;). There are still many original Rumford fireplaces. 

Rumford also invented a cast iron oven, known as the Rumford roaster. They were often installed together. This inspired the development of the kitchen range, also made in cast iron, which gave yet more control of the fire and also was used directly for cooking purposes.

<text>To Green Angel Tower is the third and final novel in Tad Williams&#x27; &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; trilogy. At over 520,000 words, it is one of the longest novels ever written. Due to the length of the novel, the paperback version had to be split into two separate volumes, known as &quot;To Green Angel Tower: Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the two paperback volumes were titled &quot;To Green Angel Tower: Siege&quot; and &quot;To Green Angel Tower: Storm&quot;. The saga follows a young man named Simon as he is caught up in an epic adventure.

==Plot introduction==
As the Storm King&#x27;s power grows, the loyal allies of Prince Josua struggle to rally their forces at the Stone of Farewell. There, Simon and the surviving members of the League of the Scroll attempt to unravel a prophecy that may ultimately allow them to strike down the undead Storm King and bring peace to the kingdom. This epic saga concludes as Simon travels back to castle Hayholt to confront Ineluki.

==Plot summary==

The story begins with the forces of Prince Josua Lackhand rallied at the Stone of Farewell, where the icy hand of the Storm King Ineluki has yet to take a deathgrip on the land. The remaining members of the League of the Scroll have also gathered at the Stone in hopes of unraveling an ancient prophecy. If deciphered, it could reveal to Josua and his army the only means of striking down the unslayable Storm King.

After Simon/Seoman Snowlock and Binabik have their reunion, they come to the realization that Memory – one of the three Great Swords recognized as being key to defeating the Storm King – is one and the same with Bright-Nail, old King John’s sword that was buried with him not three years previously. The trouble is, the grave of King John Presbyter lies in the shadow of the Hayholt, the stronghold of King Elias, and between the Stone of Farewell and Hayholt marches the army Elias has sent to besiege the defenders.
Meanwhile, Miriamele, Elias’s daughter who has joined Josua’s cause, is an unhappy prisoner on the ship of a lascivious and ambitious lordling to whom she has surrendered her virtue knowing only too late of his true nature. Another princess, Maegwin of Hernystir, falls deeper into madness, leading her people in a seemingly futile resistance against Elias’s allies who have conquered her kingdom, and deep in the ancient forest of Aldheorte, the immortal Sithi are mustering for a final conflict.

While Josua and his army must make a final stand to try to delay the forces of King Elias, Simon embarks upon a quest to Hayholt Castle to try to obtain the last of the three legendary swords and use their hidden magics to defeat The Storm King Ineluki and restore peace to Osten Ard once and for all.

==Cover art==
Two versions of the U.S. hardcover dust jacket were produced. Both have Michael Whelan paintings on the front and back with one painting being titled &quot;Seoman&quot; and the other &quot;Jiriki&quot;. The difference between the covers is that the front and back paintings were switched. Both paintings were also &quot;flopped&quot; (reversed left-to-right) so that the characters are facing away from the spine on both the front and back for both covers. The same paintings were then used as the cover art for the part 1 and part 2 paperback editions.

==Reception==
The book was listed for five weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

<doc id="1261819" wikidata="Q3435691" url="?curid=1261819" title="Ping-pong recording">
<text>Ping-pong recording (also called ping-ponging, bouncing tracks, or reduction mixing) is a method of sound recording. It involves combining multiple track stems into one, allowing more room for overdubbing when using tape recorders with a limited set of tracks. It is also used to simplify mixdowns.

The two most common methods consist of 
* Dubbing tracks between two tape recorders (or tracks on a multitrack recorder) connected through a mixing console
* Dubbing tracks internally, through the onboard mixer of many machines, including Portastudios and similar multitrackers. 

In both cases, a new instrument, voice, or other material may be added with each bounce, depending on the setup&#x27;s mixing capabilities.

In analog recording, the audio quality normally decreases with each generation, while in digital recording, the quality is usually preserved. In either case, the most leeway comes with having the best possible source material.

==Early examples==
The method was employed by Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson during the 1960s. For the recording of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), Wilson created the instrumentals of songs using a 4-track recorder. He then bounced the material onto one track of an 8-track recorder, using the remaining tracks for vocal overdubs. This meant that the album could not be suitably mixed in stereo, because the instrumental parts were locked in monaural. In 1997, advances in recording technology allowed engineer Mark Linett to resync the original first-generation instrumental stems with the second-generation overdubbed vocals for the compilation &quot;The Pet Sounds Sessions&quot; and create a true stereo mix of the album.
==Other terms==
Ping pong is also a term of derision, in particular applied to early commercial stereo recordings of the late 1950s to mid-1960s which do not have a convincing stereo image or sound-stage. Such recordings were often made in two-track form for mixing in mono, but released as authentic stereo recordings.

<text>Sweeney&#x27;s Men was an Irish traditional band. They emerged from the mid-1960s Irish roots revival, along with groups such as The Dubliners and the Clancy Brothers. The founding line-up in May 1966 was Johnny Moynihan, Andy Irvine and &quot;Galway Joe&quot; Dolan.

==First line-up==
Before creating the band in 1966, Irvine, Moynihan and Dolan had met in Dublin and had performed and travelled together, on and off, around Ireland; Irvine and Dolan hitch-hiked together around Europe (Munich, Vienna and Rome) in late 1965.

The name &#x27;Sweeney&#x27;s Men&#x27; was inspired by Dolan&#x27;s reading of Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s comic novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, which depicts the mad, anti-religious, tree-leaping pagan King Sweeney of Antrim.

The band&#x27;s manager was Eamonn O&#x27;Doherty, and he and the band travelled in a red VW van. The band often travelled to Milltown Malbay to enjoy musical sessions with the piper Willie Clancy. The early days of the band have been described by Irvine in his song &quot;My heart&#x27;s tonight in Ireland&quot;.

==Second line-up==
In June 1967, Dolan decided to travel to Israel to fight in the Six-Day War and was replaced by Terry Woods. Woods who played the 12-string guitar, had travelled in the US and studied the American folk tradition brought an American musical influence to the group.

At the time, they played the bouzouki, mandolin, guitar, tin whistle, harmonica, concertina and 5-string banjo. This line-up recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Men&quot; in 1968.

The band did not stick to Irish songs exclusively, since all three were big fans of American music and their repertoire included American songs like &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; alongside traditional songs like &quot;Willy O&#x27;Winsbury&quot; from the Scottish tradition. Irvine left the band in May 1968, to travel around Eastern Europe.

==Third line-up==
Irvine was replaced by Henry McCullough, who had been repatriated to Ireland while on an Eire Apparent tour, owing to visa problems. McCullough played electric guitar, and his tenure saw the band explore more progressive, psychedelic territory. After playing with Sweeney&#x27;s Men at the Cambridge Folk Festival, McCullough left in July 1968 to join Joe Cocker&#x27;s Grease Band, and was briefly replaced by Al O&#x27;Donnell (born Alastair Noel O&#x27;Donnell, 8 December 1943, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland, died 3 September 2015, Rathdrum, County Wicklow, Ireland).

==Final line-up==
It was as a duo that Woods and Moynihan recorded the band&#x27;s second, and final, album &quot;The Tracks of Sweeney&quot;, released in 1969 and including some of their own compositions, such as Moynihan&#x27;s &quot;Standing on the Shore&quot;. Shortly after this release, they broke up, on 22 November 1969. A new Irish-English folk super-group was almost formed in 1970, with Moynihan, Irvine (now back from his travels), Woods and his wife Gay, plus Ashley Hutchings joining on bass, but this never happened.

==Break-up and follow-on projects==
Following the break-up of Sweeney&#x27;s Men, four of the members played in other notable bands:
*Andy Irvine: Planxty, Patrick Street, East Wind, Mozaik, LAPD, Usher&#x27;s Island, and several duos (with Dónal Lunny, Paul Brady, Mick Hanly, Dick Gaughan, Rens van der Zalm and Luke Plumb) while also pursuing a solo career.
*Johnny Moynihan: Planxty, De Dannan, Fleadh Cowboys, Moonshine, solo career and with Anne Briggs and Andrew McNamara.
*Terry Woods: Steeleye Span, Gay &amp; Terry Woods, The Woods Band and The Pogues.
*Henry McCullough: The Grease Band and Wings.

==Reunions==
In 1986, Moynihan, Woods and McCullough reunited for a special edition of the BP Fallon Orchestra, a radio show hosted by Dave Fanning of RTÉ Radio.

Irvine and Moynihan were re-united for a one-off gig as Sweeney&#x27;s Men in Rostrevor, County Down on 22 July 2007, when the band was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the local Fiddler&#x27;s Green Festival; Dolan was unable to participate due to illness, so Paul Brady agreed to deputise. Irvine wrote &quot;Had hoped we might &#x27;blague&#x27; Galway Joe Dolan into doing it but he hasn&#x27;t been on a stage for about two lifetimes and that wasn&#x27;t going to work. Johnny had hit on the great idea of asking Paul Brady to play with us as Paul had stood in for Dolan at a gig in Limerick in 1967 after Joe&#x27;s speedy departure for Israel and the 6 Day War&quot;.

Irvine, Moynihan and Woods played together once again on 16 &amp; 17 June 2012, as part of Irvine&#x27;s 70th Birthday party concerts at Vicar Street in Dublin, a dozen tracks from the shows were released by Irvine as a live album. It worked so well that they gigged again in Ireland later in 2012 and also played five full-house gigs in Galway, Kilkenny, Cork, Dublin and Limerick during November 2013. Their play list included some new songs as well as old standards, in performances that demonstrated that they retain their old vitality and virtuosity across a wide range of instruments.

==Legacy==
A significant innovation that Sweeney&#x27;s Men contributed to Irish music was Moynihan&#x27;s introduction of the bouzouki, with the tuning of GDAD&#x27;, one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin instead of the traditional Greek tuning of CFAD&#x27;.

For a band with such a short lifespan, their influence was considerable. Thanks largely to Irvine, they helped evolve a more structured approach to the accompaniment of ballads. Irvine&#x27;s interaction with Moynihan&#x27;s bouzouki playing initially, and then with Lunny&#x27;s up to and including Planxty, consolidated this contrapuntal approach.

<text>The Movie Show was an Australian film review program which was broadcast on SBS TV. Its history is divided into three parts, until it finally wound up in 2008.

==History==
The original format, which ran from 30 October 1986 to 12 May 2004, had two presenters, David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz. Stratton and Pomeranz left for the ABC in early 2004, expressing dissatisfaction at high-level decisions at SBS. They soon had a new program with a similar format, &quot;At the Movies&quot;.

SBS continued &quot;The Movie Show&quot;, which underwent a style change to become more appealing to youth. Three new presenters were brought in: Megan Spencer, Fenella Kernebone and Jaimie Leonarder. Marc Fennell presented a segment reviewing newly released DVDs. The final episode of &quot;The Movie Show&quot; aired in 2006.

From 2007 to 2008, &quot;The Movie Show&quot; returned with a new interactive 10-minute format, presented by Lisa Hensley and Michael Adams.

<doc id="1261825" wikidata="Q649572" url="?curid=1261825" title="Büchner funnel">
<text>A Büchner funnel is a piece of laboratory equipment used in filtration. It is traditionally made of porcelain, but glass and plastic funnels are also available. On top of the funnel-shaped part there is a cylinder with a fritted glass disc/perforated plate separating it from the funnel. The Hirsch funnel has a similar design; it is used similarly, but for smaller quantities of material. The main difference is that the plate of a Hirsch funnel is much smaller, and the walls of the funnel angle outward instead of being vertical.

A funnel with a fritted glass disc can be used immediately. For a funnel with a perforated plate, filtration material in the form of filter paper is placed on the plate, and the filter paper is moistened with a liquid to prevent initial leakage. The liquid to be filtered is poured into the cylinder and drawn through the perforated plate/fritted glass disc by vacuum suction.

The main advantage in using this type of filtration is that it proceeds much more quickly (several orders of magnitude) than simply allowing the liquid to drain through the filter medium via the force of gravity. It is essential that the amount of liquid being used is limited to less than what would overflow the flask; otherwise, the liquid will be drawn into the vacuum equipment. If the vacuum is provided by a water flow device, an overflow of the liquid could result in the spilling of a hazardous liquid into the wastewater stream, a potential violation of the law, depending on the liquid. The potential for overflow and the potential for water to be drawn back into the flask can be reduced by using a trap between the flask and the vacuum source.

It is used in organic chemistry labs to assist in collecting recrystallized compounds. The suction allows the wet recrystallized compound to dry out such that the pure dried crystal compound is left remaining. However, it is often the case that further drying is required, by an oven or other means, in order to remove as much residual liquid as possible.

It is often used in combination with a Büchner flask, Büchner ring and sinter seals. A vacuum tight seal and stability of the Büchner flask and filter are essential during the filtration process. A Büchner ring can be used with Büchner funnels, flasks, glass crucibles and Gooch crucibles. The wide flange and large surface contact ensures an excellent vacuum tight seal whilst the rings are easy to remove and offer excellent support to even the largest funnels.

It is commonly thought to be named after the Nobel Laureate Eduard Buchner (without umlaut), but it is actually named after the industrial chemist Ernst Büchner.

<doc id="1261838" wikidata="Q314750" url="?curid=1261838" title="Edu (footballer, born 1978)">
<text>Eduardo César Daud Gaspar (born 16 May 1978), known as Edu (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer and ex sporting director of Premier League club Arsenal. As a player, he was an attacking and central midfielder, and played for Corinthians in Brazil, Arsenal in England, and Valencia in Spain across a twelve-year career.

Edu played for the Brazil national team from 2004 to 2005, making fifteen appearances.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Edu started his career in Série A with Corinthians. While with Corinthians, Edu won the 1998 and 1999 Brasileiro championships, and the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship.

===Arsenal===
After initially planning to join Arsenal in 2000, his transfer was put on hold after it was realised that he was in possession of a fake Portuguese passport. Months later, after qualifying for a European Union (EU) passport (aided by Italian lineage on his father&#x27;s side), he signed for Arsenal on 16 January 2001 for £6 million. He had a turbulent time early on as his sister was killed in a car accident.

His Arsenal debut came in 2001 in a goalless draw tarnished by an injury after 15 minutes against Leicester City. He had replaced Freddie Ljungberg at half time only to be replaced by Dennis Bergkamp minutes later. It was an unfortunate start and he only managed to play in four more matches for the club during that season, one of which was a 0–3 defeat at home to Middlesbrough in which he contributed an own goal. His first goal for the club came against Grimsby in the League Cup on 27 November 2001. He went on to make a substitute appearance in the 2002 FA Cup Final as Arsenal emerged victorious. He also contributed 14 league appearances, and a goal against Aston Villa, as Arsenal won the 2001–02 Premier League, with Edu becoming the first Brazilian to win the Premier League.

In 2002–03 Edu made 18 appearances in the Premier League and featured heavily as Arsenal got to the FA Cup final for the third year running. Edu scored in Arsenal&#x27;s fifth round win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, however injury issues in the latter part of the season meant he was left out of the squad for the final.

2003–04 season in midfield for Arsenal was seen as his finest season so far in football, he was part of the team which went 49 games unbeaten, (the whole 2003–04 Premier League season without defeat). He appeared in 30 League games and scored 2 goals, both against Chelsea, he scored the fourth of Arsenal&#x27;s 5 in a 5–1 historic win against Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League in November 2003, he made a career high 48 appearances and 7 goals for Arsenal in all competitions. Edu was on the pitch as Arsenal clinched the 2003–04 Premier League title at White Hart Lane on 25 April 2004. During the season, he made his 100th appearance for Arsenal.

Edu enjoyed mixed fortunes in the 2004–05 season. He missed the start of the season because he was away with Brazil at the Copa América. This was followed by speculation over his future at the club as he was in the last year of his contract with Arsenal. Talks with Valencia of Spain in January 2005 failed as the Mestalla outfit were not able to pay the fee Arsenal demanded.

Edu only scored two goals for Arsenal in 2004–05, both coming in May – one was a fine chip in the 2–0 away win at West Bromwich Albion, and the other a penalty kick in a 7–0 win over Everton. He did however come on as an extra time substitute as Arsenal won the 2005 FA Cup Final.

===Valencia===
In May 2005, it was confirmed that he would leave Arsenal in the summer on a Bosman ruling free transfer. Valencia, Juventus, Inter Milan, and Barcelona were hot favourites to secure the signature of Edu, and on 30 May, Valencia announced it had signed him to a five-year deal. Shortly after signing, Edu suffered a pre-season injury that ruled him out of first-team action until 4 April 2006, when he made his debut in the 5–3 victory over Cádiz. On 3 July 2009, the Brazilian midfielder left Valencia through contractual termination.

===Corinthians===
After being released in Spain, Edu signed a contract with his former club Corinthians on 6 August 2009, which was to last until 31 December 2011. After playing four matches during the 2010 season, his contract was terminated by mutual consent, and Edu announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==
Edu initially considered playing for the England national team upon gaining a British passport as he did not think he would be picked for Brazil. He finally got a call-up to the Brazil national team in 2004 and made his debut on 28 April 2004 in a friendly match against Hungary. He played for them in the 2004 Copa América and 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, which were both won by Brazil. In the final of the Copa América 2004 he scored one of the penalties in the shootout as Brazil defeated Argentina.

==Post-playing career==
On 17 March 2011, Corinthians announced that Edu would take over from William Machado as the club&#x27;s director of football. He also assisted Carlos Queiroz&#x27;s Iranian national team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. From 2016 to 2019, he was the general coordinator of the Brazil national team.

On 9 July 2019, it was announced that Edu had become Arsenal&#x27;s first-ever technical director. The club&#x27;s director of football, Raul Sanllehi said: &quot;We&#x27;re very excited that Edu is joining the team. He has great experience and technical football knowledge and most importantly is a true Arsenal man. He understands the club and what we stand for to our millions of fans around the world.&quot; On 18 November 2022, Edu was appointed as Arsenal&#x27;s first-ever sporting director. On November 4, 2024 it was reported that he was to leave his position at Arsenal to join and have a senior role at the network of clubs (Nottingham Forest, Olympiacos, Rio Ave FC) spearheaded by Greek businessman Evangelos Marinakis.

==Media==
Edu was involved in the Amazon Original sports docuseries &quot;All or Nothing: Arsenal&quot;, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. He was also involved in &quot;All or Nothing: Brazil National Team&quot;.

<doc id="1261839" wikidata="Q1413933" url="?curid=1261839" title="Sensurround">
<text>Sensurround is the brand name for a process developed by Cerwin-Vega in conjunction with Universal Studios to enhance the audio experience during film screenings, specifically for the 1974 film &quot;Earthquake&quot;. The process was intended for subsequent use and was adopted for four more films, &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977), the theatrical version of &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot; (1978), the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; pilot, as well as the compilation film &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&quot; (1979). Sensurround worked by adding extended-range bass for sound effects. The low-frequency sounds were more felt than heard, providing a vivid complement to onscreen depictions of earth tremors, bomber formations, and amusement park rides. The overall trend toward &quot;multiplex&quot; cinema structures presented challenges that made Sensurround impractical as a permanent feature of cinema.

Sensurround helped bring wider recognition to established loudspeaker manufacturer Cerwin-Vega, and aided in establishing a strong reputation for new audio amplifier company BGW Systems. The increased awareness of extended low-frequency sound reproduction that Sensurround brought to film audiences was a factor in the increase in subwoofer sales and in the rise in the number of subwoofer designs in the late 1970s and 1980s.

==Development==

===Original design===
Sensurround involved the installation of large, low frequency, horn-loaded speakers which contained specially designed 18-inch Cerwin-Vega Model 189 ES drivers in custom black wood cabinets. Three horn configurations were available, Model-C (Corner), Model-W (Folded Bass Bin) and Model-M (Modular). The Model-C and -M horns required stacking in groups of four, increasing effective horn mouth size to achieve the low frequency target. They came with special extenders used to widen the mouths of the horns and take advantage of the theater walls to further increase low frequency extension. The Model-M horn had a dedicated &quot;Mouth-Extender&quot; available when it was used in the front of the theater. While installation was customized and varied in each theater, the Sensurround horns were typically placed beneath the screen in front and in the back corners of the theater. Often, rows or sections of seats would have to be removed to make room for the large Sensurround horns. In large theaters, up to 20 individual horns might be used along with custom-built bat wings and mouth extenders.
The original Sensurround design used for &quot;Earthquake&quot; employed a pseudorandom noise generator, designed by D. Broadus &quot;Don&quot; Keele, Jr., to create the low-frequency rumble, using recordings of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake as a reference. Two low frequency control tones were printed on the film&#x27;s mono optical or magnetic track; from the projector, the tones entered a control box in the projection booth, which fed low frequency pseudorandom noise to 1,600 watt BGW 750 audio amplifiers driving the speakers. The control box generated a pseudorandom noise signal with energy between 17 and 120 Hz. The control track method was employed because there was no way to accurately record bass lower than 40 Hz on an optical or magnetic film soundtrack at the time. When receiving the noise signal, the amplifier and subwoofers responded with sound pressures ranging from 100 dB to 120 dB. The resulting rumble could be felt by audience members as well as heard.

For the film &quot;Earthquake&quot;, Sensurround was activated during the quake scenes to augment the conventional soundtrack. In addition, portions of the main soundtrack were redirected to the Sensurround horns to create a partial surround sound effect. The control tones recorded on the film&#x27;s optical or magnetic track triggered the rumble or surround sound effects as well as controlling their volume and the overall blend of the main soundtrack and low frequency noise effects. Two tones of 25 Hz and 35 Hz were used: these two tones allowed different effects to be activated when desired: the rumble could be turned on or off in the Sensurround horns, the main soundtrack could be sent to the Sensurround horns, the level of both the rumble and the soundtrack coming from the horns could be varied by varying the level of the control tones and the theater&#x27;s main audio system could be increased in level by up to 8 dB at select points to create a greater dynamic range (MCA called this the &quot;Step-Gain&quot; function.)

For the original version of Sensurround, prints were available in the following formats:

*35mm 4-Track Magnetic with Optical Track (magoptical): This type of Sensurround print was not usable as a mono optical print. Unlike standard magoptical prints, in which the optical track was a mono version of the magnetic stereo tracks, the optical track on magnetic Sensurround prints contained only the control tones. If played as a standard optical print, only the 25 Hz and 35 Hz control tones would be heard. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from −14 to −6 dB below 100% modulation and activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −16 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, Track-2 (Center Front) was used, with its level and timing controlled by the 25 Hz control tone. For magnetic playback in mono, Track-2 (Center Front) could be used because &quot;Earthquake&quot; was mixed with mono dialogue, unlike most stereo films up to that time. For 4-Track equipped theaters that wanted to run &quot;Earthquake&quot; without Sensurround, the standard 12 kHz CinemaScope switching signal was recorded on Track-4 (surround). Because no noise reduction system was used on magnetic prints at the time, and due to the lower technical performance of the surround channels magnetic track, this switching system was implemented by 20th Century Fox during CinemaScope&#x27;s development to reduce the hiss and system noise heard from the surround speakers. For &quot;Earthquake&quot; run in the United States, the surround speakers were disconnected and the Sensurround system was relied upon to produce all the surround sound effects; Track-4 was not used nor even connected to the Sensurround Integrator. In Europe, the surround track was used in the normal manner, being controlled by the Sensurround Integrator like the other magnetic channels.
*35mm Mono Optical: These were dual-purpose prints and could be used either with or without Sensurround. The optical track was a composite mix of the program and the control tones and were compatible with any optical playback system. All mono mixes of the &quot;Earthquake&quot; soundtrack contain the control tones. To control the Sensurround System and its volume levels, control tones recorded on the optical track varied from −28 dB to −20 dB below 100% modulation. Activation of the Sensurround System occurred at −30 dB. For program sounds applied to the Sensurround Horns, the composite mono soundtrack was used, with its volume and timing regulated by the 25 Hz control tone.
*70mm 6-Track Magnetic Stereo: The Sensurround Control Tones were recorded on Tracks 2 and 4 and are 100 Hz instead of 25 Hz and 35 Hz. This was because the magnetic system could not reproduce the very low-frequency control tones reliably. The 100 Hz tone on Track-2 controls the program effects applied to the Sensurround Horns and the 100 Hz tone on Track-4 controls the rumble effect applied to the Sensurround horns. Like the other systems, the level of the 100 Hz tones varies the levels applied to the Sensurround horns and when both control tones are present, the Step/Hi-Gain function is turned on to increase the dynamic range of the main program by 8 dB. Track-3 (Center Front) is applied to the Sensurround system for program sounds. No other signal is recorded on Tracks 2 and 4. 70mm Sensurround prints were issued only outside of the US. In addition, &quot;Earthquake&quot; was the only Sensurround film recorded in stereo or issued with 70mm prints. All other Sensurround films were 35mm mono optical in the Sensurround Mod-II or Mod-III format.

===Sensurround Mod-II===
Even before &quot;Earthquake&quot; ended its theatrical run, MCA began a program to re-engineer the Sensurround system to enable the recording of the deep bass on a standard 35mm optical soundtrack, with no external rumble generator being required, as well as improve fidelity and the overall effect and to simplify the system. In addition, dbx Type-II noise reduction was incorporated to increase the dynamic range and reduce audible noise created by the optical process. MCA also changed the way the control tones were used, allowing the Sensurround horns in the front and back of the theater to be controlled independently. This allowed for more creative effects, such as a sound being panned from front to back of the theater. Re-engineering the system was important to MCA because there were times during dialogue sequences when the sound mixers wanted the Sensurround running but did not want the dialogue to shift to the back of the theater. Having separate control of the front and back groups of Sensurround horns allowed this. The drivers in the Sensurround horns were improved to extend their frequency response higher so they could reproduce the low notes in music, thus allowing sound mixers to incorporate music into the Sensurround system (this was used to good effect in &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;.) Advancements by RCA in optical soundtrack recording led MCA engineers to the realization that an optical track could reliably record and reproduce bass down to 10 Hz. As well, removal of the Academy equalization would allow the high frequency response to be extended upward by an additional octave. The addition of dbx Type-II noise reduction and its attendant increase in useful dynamic range created a high-fidelity sound from a conventional optical print. MCA called this re-engineering of the system &quot;Sensurround Mod-II&quot; and the market name of the system was changed from just &quot;Sensurround&quot; to the &quot;Sensurround Special Effects System&quot;.

Unlike the original version of Sensurround, Mod-II (and later, Mod-III) were only for use with mono optical soundtracks. Due to the use of dbx Type-II noise reduction, MCA eliminated the standard Academy Filter traditionally used on optical prints, thus giving Sensurround an increased frequency response of 16 Hz to 16 kHz and a dynamic range of 86 dB, superior to 70mm magnetic prints of the time. It also allowed a mono optical track to have surround sound effects and MCA began to market the system to other studios and producers as a truly high-fidelity sound and special effects system. Dolby Stereo optical was just beginning to become known in the industry and MCA felt they had a viable competing format. While Warner Bros. and Paramount seriously considered adopting the system, in the end only Universal Studios ever released films using the process. Both Warner and Paramount later patented their own &quot;special effects&quot; systems to create Sensurround-type effects.

===Sensurround Mod-III===

Mod-III Sensurround was a further refinement of the system to allow more control over level, timbre and placement of effects. Instead of a simple wide-range rumble that could be felt and heard, Mod-III used more narrow band extended low frequency effects in the 16–25 Hz range, in addition to the higher frequency program sounds and surround-sound effect. Thus, scenes could have dialogue and other audio at standard levels, plus the effect of movement from the infrasonic rumble, creating sensations that had not been possible in earlier Sensurround films. Mod-III Sensurround was used in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in 1978.

By 1976, when &quot;Midway&quot; opened, there were over 800 theaters with Sensurround capability in the US. Worldwide, there were over 2000 Sensurround theaters. During the initial design of the system MCA figured it would be installed in a limited number of theaters across the US—perhaps 30 in all—and that smaller theaters, or theaters in small towns, would not want to bother with the installation or the loss of seating capacity necessitated by the large Sensurround horns. This was quickly disproved: &quot;Earthquake&quot; premiered with 17 Sensurround installations and by the end of its run over 400 theaters had shown the film in Sensurround. &quot;Midway&quot; opened with 300 Sensurround-equipped theaters. At first, MCA only rented Sensurround to theaters at a cost of $500 per week, but by the opening of &quot;Midway&quot;, theaters could purchase the systems outright and MCA had begun to ship the Model-M horns to theaters un-assembled. Theater owners also had the option of purchasing only the Cerwin-Vega drivers and horn cabinet blueprints, buying the wood and making the horn cabinets themselves. MCA made these changes due to the success of the system and because the shipping costs of the heavy Sensurround horns were becoming very expensive.

Throughout the history of the Sensurround program, RCA Technical Services performed the theater installations and maintenance. If repairs or replacements were required, the RCA technicians contacted MCA Systems to order needed parts. Because control tones were used to trigger the Sensurround horns, theaters could not generally use the system with their standard films unless a rewiring was done.

===Awards===
In 1974, Waldon O. Watson, Richard J. Stumpf, Robert J. Leonard and the Universal City Studios Sound Department received a special Scientific and Engineering Academy Award for &quot;the development and engineering of the Sensurround System for motion picture presentation&quot;. The film &quot;Earthquake&quot; also won an Academy Award for Best Sound (Ronald Pierce, Melvin M. Metcalfe Sr.).

In 1976, MCA was granted for the Sensurround system.

===Drawbacks===
Sensurround speakers involved expense for theater owners. Rental for speakers cost $500 per week in 1974 and their installation involved the removal of some seats. The extra expense was commercially justifiable as long as it appeared to provide an advantage in drawing audiences.

Sensurround made &quot;Earthquake&quot; a popular &quot;event&quot; film in 1974 and one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films. Sensurround presented practical challenges, though, in multiplex cinemas where separate theater spaces shared walls. Audiences for &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, which opened the same month (November 1974) as &quot;Earthquake&quot;, often complained to theater managers about the Sensurround effect when &quot;Earthquake&quot; was shown in an adjoining theater. The low-frequency vibrations rattled tiles and plaster, too, leading to damage in some venues; a safety net was installed at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to catch errant pieces of plaster falling from the ceiling. When &quot;Earthquake&quot; was screened in Chicago, the head of the Chicago Building and Safety Department demanded that the system be turned down or removed to prevent damage to city theaters. In Germany, Sensurround movies could only be screened in single-screen houses. Subsequent Sensurround films, such as &quot;Midway&quot;, also tended to play in single-screen cinemas.

The success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; over &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; in the middle of 1977 demonstrated to theater operators the limits of Sensurround as a guarantor of audience draw. &quot;Battlestar Galactica: Saga of a Star World&quot; (1978) and &quot;Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack&quot; (1979) marked the final bows of Sensurround, though &quot;Alien&quot;, a 20th Century Fox film, would see a limited release in 70mm Sensurround.

===Competing processes===

The success of Sensurround as an effect led rival studios to develop their own audio enhancements. 20th Century Fox released &quot;Damnation Alley&quot; (1977) in (and mixed &quot;Alien&quot; in Sensurround following Sound 360&#x27;s failure), and Warner Brothers employed their Megasound process for &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), &quot;Outland&quot; (1981), &quot;Wolfen&quot; (1981) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1981).

==Cultural references==
The alternative pop/rock band They Might Be Giants released a song titled &quot;Sensurround&quot; that was incorporated in the soundtrack to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; and (in a different, faster-paced recording) their EP &quot;S-E-X-X-Y&quot;. The song makes several references to the innovation, especially as used in &quot;Earthquake&quot;.

In the 1993 film &quot;Matinee&quot;, &quot;Mant!&quot;, Matinee&#x27;s film-within-a-film, was filmed in &quot;Rumble-Rama&quot;, an unsubtle nod to Sensurround.

The Sensurround process is parodied in the 1977 film &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; in a sketch in which the fictional film &quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot; is screened in &quot;Feel-Around&quot;, whereby a uniformed usher touches the viewer in time with the action on the screen, including assaulting and kissing them.

<doc id="1261840" wikidata="Q7169052" url="?curid=1261840" title="Perkins Observatory">
<text>Perkins Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Delaware, Ohio, United States. It is owned and operated by Ohio Wesleyan University.

In 1931 it had the third largest telescope in the World; the 69 inch aperture Perkins telescope came online at this observatory. The mirror was the largest cast in the United States up to that time, and it was made by the United States National Bureau of Standards.

In the 1930s this observatory also started periodic document release called &quot;The Telescope,&quot; featuring results from the telescope but grew to include other astronomical information.

The University partnered with Ohio State University in 1935, to help run the big telescope and the agreement lasted for almost seven decades. In the 1960s the telescope was moved to Arizona, USA for better viewing conditions, and fitted with new larger mirror. Nevertheless, the Observatory continued to be a hub of astronomical activity in the region and for the University.

In the 21st century the Observatory supports various public and academic astronomical activities and is a source for information such as NEO flybys in the community.

==Early history==

The observatory is named for Hiram Perkins, a professor of mathematics and astronomy at the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio from 1857 to 1907. A devoutly religious Methodist and a man of deep convictions, he was also known as an uncompromising and demanding instructor.Perkins&#x27; believed that “The public should have an opportunity to see with a great telescope the objects such an instrument reveals and by so doing ‘Learn to love God and serve Him more acceptably.’&quot;

Perkins graduated from Ohio Wesleyan in 1857, just nine years after the university was founded. He was immediately offered a position on the faculty. Shortly thereafter he married Caroline Barkdull, a graduate from OWU&#x27;s Women&#x27;s College.

In 1861 Perkins temporarily left OWU when the American Civil War began. He intended to enlist in the Union Army, but was deemed physically unfit for service. (At 6’4” tall and 97 pounds, his students referred to him as “the human skeleton.”) Perkins then returned to his family hog farm and worked to help feed the troops. (Salt pork was a staple military food at the time.) Applying his mathematical skills to the science of pork production, by war&#x27;s end he had amassed an impressive (for the time) fortune. After the war Perkins returned to his university teaching position and lived a very frugal life on his small salary. Meanwhile, his shrewd business investments caused his fortune to multiply considerably.

In 1896 Professor Perkins donated the funds necessary to build the first of two observatories to bear his name. It is located on West William Street in Delaware, Ohio right next to Hiram and Caroline&#x27;s former residence. This original “Perkins Astronomical Observatory” later had its name changed to “the Student Observatory” when the second Perkins Observatory was built a quarter century later.

Perkins&#x27;s marriage never produced children. His older sister never married. Therefore, toward the end of his life Perkins realized he had no living relatives to whom to leave his fortune. Retiring in 1907, Professor Perkins applied himself to the creation of “an astronomical observatory of importance.” It was his desire that this second observatory be a place where cutting-edge research could be conducted. It took 15 years to find an appropriate location and secure the necessary funding (Perkins himself provided about $250,000, the equivalent of roughly $3.8 million dollars in 2019, of the approximately $350,000 budget).

Construction began in 1923 with the frail 90-year-old professor as Guest of Honor at the groundbreaking ceremony. Within a year, however, both Hiram and Caroline Perkins had died. Neither saw the completion of the new observatory.

The building features a reproduction of Robert Le Lorrain&#x27;s (the original article in &#x27;Popular Astronomy&#x27; misidentified him as Robert de Lorain) &quot;Apollo Watering the Horses of the Sun&quot; over the front entrance and a frieze of antique marble panels around the building bears the names of seventeen astronomers:
The building and telescope mount were completed in less than two years. The work was done by the Warner and Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio. (Warner and Swasey also built other observatories and telescopes, including Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Theodore Jacobsen Observatory in Seattle, Washington, McCormick Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, and (of course) the Warner and Swasey Observatory in Cleveland, Ohio.) The building included a lecture room, library, office space, walk-in vault, small bedroom for visiting astronomers, and spacious work rooms and metal fabrication shops.

However, Professor Perkins had stipulated that the telescope mirror be cast in the United States. At this time no U.S. companies had experience in casting such a large mirror, so the National Bureau of Standards agreed to take on the project. It can be argued that casting of this mirror launched the optical glass industry in the United States.

The first four attempts to cast the mirror were unsuccessful. The fifth attempt, using a different technique, created a blank (somewhat larger than originally intended). Three years of grinding and polishing followed. When installed in the telescope mount in 1931, it was the third largest mirror in the world. (Prior to installation of the mirror, the observatory used a mirror on loan from Harvard University.)

==OSU era==

Early on it became apparent that the Ohio Wesleyan University simply did not have the staff or expertise necessary to operate one of the world&#x27;s most important observatories. In 1935 a cooperative agreement was reached with the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio to staff and operate Perkins Observatory. For the next 63 years, for most practical purposes, the observatory belonged to OSU.

The following three decades were Golden Years for Perkins Observatory. The remote skies were dark (if somewhat cloudy). Famous astronomers from around the world traveled to central Ohio to use the large telescope. Important meetings of professional and amateur astronomers were hosted on site. The library collection grew to include many rare volumes.

Astronomer Philip C. Keenan spent most of his professional life as an astronomer working at Perkins Observatory. (He was employed by the Ohio State University, not Ohio Wesleyan.) Using the telescope he spent almost 20 years taking spectrographic plates of vast areas of the night sky. In collaboration with William Wilson Morgan of Yerkes Observatory, Dr. Keenan helped to create the M-K System of Stellar Classification. (“M” is for Morgan and “K” is for Keenan.) This is the most common stellar classification system used by astronomers today.

In 1932 the Acting Director of the Observatory Nikolai T. Bobrovnikov began publication of a small in-house magazine known as “The Telescope.” At first this quarterly dealt primarily with research and current events related to Perkins Observatory, but in following issues it expanded its coverage of topics somewhat. In 1941 it merged with another small astronomy magazine known as “The Sky” to create “Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine.”

Another stipulation in Hiram Perkins’ endowment was that observing sessions be open to the public at least once a month.

The radio telescope known as Big Ear was built on Perkins Observatory property and operated from 1963 to 1998. It was famous in part for its work on SETI and the WOW! Signal detected in 1977. This instrument was built and operated by the Ohio State University.

OSU had been given a 12.5 inch aperture refractor and observatory in 1895, the McMillin Observatory, however they gave the telescope away in the 1960s and razed the old observatory in 1976.

==Perkins - the difficult years==

Central Ohio is not, as it turns out, a particularly good location for an astronomical research telescope. The low elevation and generally cloudy weather conspired to frustrate most astronomers using the telescope. More troublesome, the cities of Columbus, Ohio to the south and Delaware, Ohio to the north were both growing. Light pollution therefore became increasingly problematic. So in 1961 the Perkins Telescope was moved to Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Lowell is the largest private observatory (non-university or government affiliated) in the world. Through the end of the 20th century, the Perkins Telescope was the observatory&#x27;s largest instrument. Observing time on this instrument was shared between Lowell astronomers and the Ohio State University.

The telescope at Perkins was immediately replaced with a cassegrain reflector telescope. It was donated by Michael R. Schottland, an entrepreneur from Martinsville, Virginia. At that time it was the largest privately owned telescope in the United States. Currently it is one of the three largest telescopes in Ohio.

In 1964, three years after the Perkins Telescope arrived at Lowell Observatory, the mirror was replaced. A new mirror made of a more modern material was installed in the old mount. The old mirror was loaned to COSI in Columbus as an exhibit. (Eventually the 69 inch was returned to Perkins by the year 1999)

Part of the arrangement between OSU, OWU, and Lowell Observatory called for Ohio State to continue to fund operations at Perkins Observatory. This included maintaining the building, the library, and the monthly public programs. However, over the following decades, without a research instrument on site, interest in Perkins Observatory within the Ohio State University Astronomy Department declined. The on-site staff shrank until there was just a part-time secretary and a building superintendent who had only a small maintenance budget. Few of the observatory&#x27;s Directors (employees of OSU) spent much time at the observatory. There was not even enough money in the budget to maintain subscriptions to prominent astronomy magazines for the Observatory&#x27;s library.

For some years a small dome detached and separated from the main observatory building housed a 0.6-meter f1.8 Schmidt telescope. In 1990 this instrument was moved to Lowell Observatory and extensively refurbished using funding from NASA. In 1993 this new instrument came online as the LONEOS system to detect near-Earth asteroids. However, at the time Perkins Observatory received no compensation for use of this instrument.

At Ohio Wesleyan University, unfortunately, interest in Perkins Observatory also waned. Little concern was shown toward maintaining the historic property. An endowment fund of approximately $90,000 left by Hiram Perkins in his will (intended to fund observatory operations and the Director&#x27;s salary) disappeared somewhere into the OWU&#x27;s general endowment fund. Worst of all, most of the land surrounding the observatory was sold to developers. Of a sizable initial plot, by 1990 only remained. (A golf course was built on the sold off property, which later also swallowed up the Big Ear radio telescope.)

==Rebirth and reinvention==

In the 1990s, Tom Burns, a member of the Columbus Astronomical Society and professor of English at the Ohio Wesleyan University, became Director of Perkins Observatory. He greatly expanded the Observatory&#x27;s public programs and visibility in the central Ohio area.

A collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship was also established with the Columbus Astronomical Society. (In exchange for monthly meeting space and observatory access the CAS provides volunteer assistance with the many public programs.)

Major repairs to the observatory dome were undertaken, thanks to the profits made from the sale of eclipse viewing glasses for the 1994 solar eclipse. Unused office and storage space was converted into exhibit rooms, a children&#x27;s play area and a small gift shop. In September 1999 the original telescope mirror was retrieved from COSI (where it had been sitting in a closet for over a decade) and placed on display.

In 1998 the Ohio State University formally ended its relationship with Ohio Wesleyan University and Perkins Observatory. OSU withdrew from the 1935 agreement so it could apply its financial resources to purchasing time on the Large Binocular Telescope on Mount Graham. The telescope was sold outright to Lowell Observatory by Ohio Wesleyan. (The proceeds of this sale went into the Perkins Observatory Endowment Fund.) Staff members who were technically Ohio State University employees started receiving their paychecks from OWU.

==Current use==
Currently, regular observing programs are held almost every Friday and Saturday night throughout the year. Programs are held on other evenings and during the day by special appointment. A monthly lecture series detailing various current topics in astronomy is ongoing. Occasional special events (like telescope fairs, celebrity guest lecturers, and viewings of unusual astronomical events) are also sponsored and organized by Perkins. (Thousands of people visited the observatory to see comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. Each time a notable solar eclipse is visible from Central Ohio, several thousand pairs of eclipse glasses are distributed and educational school programs scheduled. Ed Krupp, Director of Griffith Observatory and John Dobson, inventor of the Dobsonian telescope, have both visited and lectured at Ohio Wesleyan thanks to Perkins sponsorship.)

Perkins Observatory is now the most visible and most reliable source of information related to astronomy and space exploration in central Ohio. Television stations, newspapers, other local science museums, and members of the general public rely on Professor Burns and his staff to answer questions, provide perspective, make media appearances and dispel astronomical misconceptions.

== Near-Earth object flyby ==

In 2019, Perkin Observatory was noted for pointing out the flyby of the Near-Earth asteroid 1999 KW4 (66391 Moshup) by a local radio station. They recommend viewing it with at least a 8-inch aperture telescope, and that it would be about 3 million miles away from the Earth during its flyby. The asteroid will not return until 2036.

==Challenges==
Perkins Observatory faces many challenges as it begins the 21st Century.

Like many public institutions without government support, Perkins faces funding limitations. Although the Ohio Wesleyan University is very supportive, it cannot by itself provide adequate monies for staff, program expansion, or maintenance on the historic building. (An endowment fund has been established, and donations are accepted.)

Since the observatory was constructed 1923–1931, it experiences many maintenance challenges typical of older, historic buildings. Costly repairs and heating and cooling expenses eat into the limited budget. Also, handicapped accessibility was not a concern in the 1920s. Retrofitting the building for public use while keeping its unique architectural identity has proved to be difficult, costly, and time-consuming.

The most troublesome challenge that Perkins Observatory must now deal with is the increasing effect of light pollution. The city of Delaware is expanding from the north while Columbus expands from the south. Although lighting regulations exist which cover the surrounding area, enforcing compliance is a constant struggle. Observatory staff recognizes that the day is coming when observation of deep sky objects will no longer be possible from the site.

==The 69-inch Perkins of 1931==

The 69-inch Perkins was the 3rd largest telescope in the World when it came online in 1931.

;Contemporaries at first light:
In 1961 the telescope was moved out from Perkins Observatory, and eventually the 69 inch mirror was put in a museum. The 69 inch was replaced with a new 72 inch mirror in the 1960s, which is why it was later called the 72 inch Perkins, not the 69 inch.

It was featured in a telescope exhibit at one point, but was eventually walled in a closet and thus not available for viewing. The mirror was returned to Perkins observatory by 1999, and was put on display. The mirror was the first large mirror cast in the United States and probably the third largest telescope mirror in the World when it came into use in 1931. The mirror blank weighed 3000 pounds and was cast in 1927 by the United States Bureau of Standards. It needed 8 months to cool properly.

The Perkins telescope, with the 72 inch mirror, was sold to Lowell Observatory in 1998. The evolved version of the Perkins is located at Anderson Mesa in Arizona, where it is now used by that Observatory and other universities.

<doc id="1261843" wikidata="Q567516" url="?curid=1261843" title="Milbenkäse">
<text>Milbenkäse (&quot;mite cheese&quot;), called Mellnkase in the local dialect and often known as Spinnenkäse (&quot;spider cheese&quot;), is a German speciality cheese. It is made by flavouring balls of quark (a type of soft cheese) with caraway and salt, allowing them to dry, and then leaving them in a wooden box containing rye flour and cheese mites for about three months. An enzyme in the digestive juices excreted by the mites causes the cheese to ripen. Milbenkäse tastes similar to Harzer cheese, but with a bitter note (increasing with age) and a zesty aftertaste. Mites clinging to the cheese rind are consumed along with the cheese.

Historically, the cheese was produced in the Zeitz and Altenburg districts of the Saxony-Anhalt / Thuringia border region; today it is produced exclusively in the village of Würchwitz, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.

The traditional method of making Milbenkäse, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was nearly lost by 1970, with only the elderly Liesbeth Brauer knowing the technique. Local science teacher Helmut Pöschel was taught the proper way to make it and together with his associate, Christian Schmelzer, succeeded in revitalizing the tradition. A Cheese Mite Memorial was later erected at Würchwitz to celebrate the renaissance of Milbenkäse production.

==Production==

Quark flavoured with salt and caraway is shaped into small balls, cylinders or wheels, and dried. It is then placed in a wooden box containing rye flour and inhabited by &quot;Tyrophagus casei&quot; mites for at least three months. The digestive juices of the mites diffuse into the cheese and cause fermentation; the flour is added because the mites would otherwise simply eat the whole cheese instead of just nibbling away at the crust as is desired. After one month, the cheese rind turns yellow; after three months, reddish brown. Some producers allow the cheese to ripen for up to one year, until it has turned black.

==Legality==
Milbenkäse falls into a legal grey area: European Union regulations allow the sale of foodstuffs containing living animals if they are &quot;prepared for placing on the market for human consumption&quot;. On the other hand, cheese mites or their digestive juices are not explicitly permitted as additives for cheese according to the relevant German food ordinances (&quot;Zusatzstoff-Zulassungsverordnung&quot; and &quot;Käseverordnung&quot;). Milbenkäse is produced under a permit by the local food safety office, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points compliance of the product is enforced.

<doc id="1261846" wikidata="Q2500821" url="?curid=1261846" title="Tarcutta">
<text>Tarcutta is a town in south-western New South Wales, Australia. The town is south-west of Sydney, east of the Hume Highway, It was proclaimed as a village on 28 October 1890. As of 2016, the town had a population of 446.

It serves a local farming community relying for its prosperity mainly on sheep and cattle, and the interstate truckies who use the town as a halfway change-over point in the trade between the state capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

==History==
The Tarcutta area was first visited by the European explorers Hume and Hovell as they passed through on their way from Sydney to Port Phillip in the Colony of Victoria. On 7 January 1825, near the present site of Tarcutta, they met a group of Wiradjuri aborigines.

A decade after this first European contact around 1835–37, &quot;Hambledon&quot;, a U-shaped slab house was built at Tarcutta. It was the first inn and post office to be built between Gundagai and Albury. Tarcutta Post Office opened on 1 January 1849.

Among the earliest settlers was Thomas Hodges Mate. Mate was Tarcutta&#x27;s earliest innkeeper, as well as its first post-master. Mate&#x27;s daughter Annie claimed that &#x27;tarcutta&#x27; was a Wiradjuri word meaning &#x27;a food prepared by grinding grass seed&#x27;.

Gold was mined in the area round Tarcutta, with limited success.

By the 1880s Tarcutta locals were actively lobbying for a rail branch line from Wagga Wagga to Tumbarumba via Tarcutta, and in 1917 the Tumbarumba branch line became a reality. A section of the line sustained major flood damage in 1974, and the remainder of the line was closed in 1987.

The Tarcutta bypass is west of the village, linking-up to the freeway to the north of the village and south of the village. It was opened to traffic on 15 November 2011.

==Trucking industry==
Tarcutta is situated halfway between Sydney and Melbourne on the Hume Highway, and has long been popular in the trucking industry as a stopping and changeover point for drivers.

The local park houses the National Truck Drivers&#x27; Memorial to the truck drivers who have died on the infamous local stretch of the Hume Highway, as well as around the country. The country singer, Slim Dusty, endorsed the memorial with a plaque. A commemorative event is held annually in October.

The local café, which has sustained generations of truckies, has also been the source of inspiration for some of Australia&#x27;s recent modern poets, Les Murray and Bruce Dawe. Murray wrote &quot;The Burning Truck&quot; while visiting the café in 1961 and Dawe immortalised the eatery in a couple of lines in his poem &quot;Under Way&quot;. The poem reads in part: &#x27;there would be days / banging open and shut like the wire door of the cafe in Tarcutta / where the flies sang at the windows&#x27;.

There had been extensive political arguing since 1999 between Federal and State Governments over funding and where to site a proposed Tarcutta truck changeover facility. It was finally decided to place it off the main street and the project which was completed early 2007 was jointly funded at a cost of $6.5m. Truck drivers are required to stop for 30 minutes every five hours.

==Heritage listings==
Tarcutta has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Tarcutta Street: Hambledon Homestead

==Other features==
Tarcutta is also the birthplace of former Grand Slam champion tennis player Tony Roche. A left-hander, Roche had a successful singles and double career and won 12 Grand Slam men&#x27;s doubles tournaments.

Located nearby is the Tarcutta Hills Reserve, owned and managed by Bush Heritage Australia. This reserve provides an important remnant of white box woodland with a relatively untouched grassy understory: a last refuge for the squirrel glider, endangered birds like the swift parrot, and as many as 11 other threatened wildlife species. The site is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

In 1969, the Tarcutta Rugby League side became the Group 13 Rugby League premiers. Their superior season also saw them crowned as the Clayton Cup winners for 1969.

<text>Robert Kenneth Ressler (February 15, 1937 – May 5, 2013) was an American FBI agent and author. He played a significant role in the psychological profiling of violent offenders in the 1970s and is often credited with coining the term &quot;serial killer&quot;, though the term is a direct translation of the German term &quot;Serienmörder&quot; coined in 1930 by Berlin investigator Ernst Gennat. After retiring from the FBI, he authored a number of books on serial murders, and often gave lectures on criminology.

== Early life ==
Robert Ressler grew up on North Marmora Avenue in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from Schurz High School, Class of 1955. He was the son of Joseph, who worked in security and maintenance at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and Gertrude Ressler. At an early age Robert became interested in killers, as he followed the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s articles on &quot;The Lipstick Killer&quot;. Ressler claims that he was more fascinated than afraid of this notorious killer, as other killers fascinated him in his later years with the FBI. His fascination would be bolstered decades later by John Wayne Gacy, who had grown up in the same neighborhood as Ressler, and was in the Boy Scouts with him. Ressler attended two years at a community college before joining the U.S. Army and was stationed in Okinawa. After two years in the army Ressler decided to enroll in the School of Criminology and Police Administration at Michigan State University. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and started graduate work but only finished one semester before going back into the army as an officer, having also completed an ROTC program at Michigan State.

== Military career ==
Ressler served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1962 as a provost marshal of a platoon of MPs in Aschaffenburg, as he states in his autobiography &quot;Whoever Fights Monsters&quot;. He was in charge of solving cases such as homicides, robberies, and arson. After four years in Germany, Ressler decided to leave the position and was reassigned as the Commander of a Criminal Investigation Division (CID) at Fort Sheridan. He then went back to Michigan State to finish his master&#x27;s in police administration, paid for by the army, in exchange for two more years of service after graduation. After he received his degree, he served a year in Thailand and a year in Fort Sheridan, where he ended his career with the army as a major, and moved on to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

== FBI career ==
Ressler joined the FBI in 1970 and was recruited into the Behavioral Science Unit, which deals with drawing up psychological profiles of violent offenders, such as rapists and serial killers, who typically select victims at random.

Between 1976 and 1979, Ressler and criminal profiler coordinator of the Behavioral Science Unit John Douglas together organized the interviews of thirty-six incarcerated serial killers in order to find parallels between such criminals&#x27; backgrounds and motives. In addition, Ressler and retired Detective Pierce Brooks of the LAPD were instrumental in setting up Vi-CAP (Violent Criminal Apprehension Program). This consists of a centralized computer database of information on unsolved homicides. Information is gathered from local police forces and cross-referenced with other unsolved killings across the United States. Working on the basis that most serial killers claim similar victims with a standard method (&quot;modus operandi&quot;) it hopes to spot early on when a killer is carrying out crimes in different jurisdictions. This was primarily a response to the appearance of nomadic killers who committed crimes in different areas. So long as the killer kept on the move, the police forces in each state would be unaware that there were multiple victims and would just be investigating a single homicide each, unaware that other police forces had similar crimes. Vi-CAP would help individual police forces determine if they were hunting for the same perpetrator so that they could share and correlate information with one another, increasing their chances of identifying a suspect.

He worked on many cases of serial homicide such as Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Richard Chase and John Joubert, and Montie Rissell.

== Later life and death ==
Ressler retired from the FBI in 1990 and authored a number of books about serial murder. He actively gave lectures to students and police forces on the subject of criminology and, in 1993, was brought in, in London, to assist in the investigation into the murders committed by Colin Ireland. In 1995, Ressler met South African profiler Micki Pistorius at a conference in Scotland and she invited him to review her investigation of the &quot;ABC Murders&quot;, so-called because of their location in the Johannesburg suburbs of Atteridgeville, Boksburg, and Cleveland. A man named David Selepe had died in police custody while being investigated as a suspect for the Cleveland murders, prior to the discovery of the Atteridgeville and Boksburg crimes, and the authorities feared that they had killed an innocent man while the real culprit was still at large. Ressler believed that Selepe was indeed responsible for the Cleveland murders, either alone or with an accomplice, and that the Atteridgeville and Boksburg murders had been committed by the same offender, but that this killer was not involved in the Cleveland murders. He also pointed out that the Atteridgeville-Boksburg murderer was gaining confidence with each killing and would contact the media. As predicted, serial killer Moses Sithole called the South African newspaper &quot;The Star&quot; to claim responsibility for the Atteridgeville and Boksburg murders, some time after Ressler left the case.

Ressler&#x27;s visit to Ciudad Juárez in Mexico to investigate the still-active feminicides occurring there served as inspiration for the character Albert Kessler in Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;2666&quot;.

Ressler died at his home in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, on Sunday May 5, 2013, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, aged 76.

== Model for fictional characters ==
A screenplay adapted from his colleague John E. Douglas&#x27; book &quot;&quot; was picked up by Netflix. &quot;Mindhunter&quot; stars Holt McCallany, who plays the character Special Agent Bill Tench, a lead character based on Ressler. In 2021, Ressler was portrayed by Jake Hays in &quot;Ted Bundy: American Boogeyman&quot;. In 2024, Ressler was portrayed by Sean Cameron Michael in the South African true-crime series &quot;Catch Me a Killer&quot;.

<doc id="1261879" wikidata="Q623980" url="?curid=1261879" title="Philippine Football Federation">
<text>The Philippine Football Federation (PFF) is the governing body of association football in the Philippines. Established as the Philippine Amateur Football Association (PAFA) in 1907, the PFF is one of the oldest national football associations in Asia and is among the founding members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The PAFA reorganized as the Philippine Football Association (PFA), and later as the Philippine Football Federation.

Aside from being a member of the AFC, the PFF is also a member of the ASEAN Football Federation. It is recognized as the national sports association (NSA) for the sport of football in the Philippines by Philippine Olympic Committee.

It organizes the Philippines men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth national football teams (as well as national teams for the football variants of futsal and beach soccer). It is also responsible for the organization of domestic football tournaments in the Philippines such as the Philippines Football League and the Copa Paulino Alcantara through the Liga Futbol Inc., and the PFF Women&#x27;s League.

==History==
===Early history===
The football body&#x27;s origins dates back to 1907 when it was established as the Philippine Amateur Football Association (PAFA). It was among the twelve founding Asian football associations of the Asian Football Confederation.

In 1917, the first Spanish and Filipino footballer to play for a European club, Paulino Alcántara Riestra, was selected by the Philippines to represent the country at the Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo. He helped them defeat Japan 15–2, which remains the largest win in Philippine international football history.

In 1961, stakeholders of Philippine football officially organized themselves to establish the Philippine Football Association (PFA) which was later reorganized as the Philippine Football Federation in 1982.

===Adad era===
In October 1996, Rene Adad was installed as PFF president after a snap election which ousted his predecessor, Ricardo Tan. In 2002, the PFF inaugurated its first regional center in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo.

===Martinez era===
The PFF under the Presidency of Jose Mari Martinez saw crises which challenged his leadership as well as the national teams.

Under Martinez, the PFF also had a new headquarters, the PFF House of Football in Pasig, which was inaugurated by then FIFA President Sepp Blatter and AFC President bin Hammam in 2008. The PFF moved to the building after occupying the PhilSports Complex as its headquarters for decades.

In 2009, a crisis affected the Philippine women&#x27;s national futsal which resulted to the ouster of women&#x27;s futsal coach Emmanuel Batungbacal and long-time men&#x27;s national football coach Juan Cutillas. Batungbacal was sacked allegedly leading the futsal team in a tournament without sanction from the PFF. Batungbacal said that he had sanction and he claimed Martinez ignored to make a dialogue with him on the matter. The players who played under Batungbacal resigned from international duty as protests. Martinez said that a lack of suitable coaching license was the reason to Batungbacal&#x27;s dismissal.

On 27 November 2010, at the PFF 7th Ordinary Congress at the PhilSports Complex in Pasig, Martinez was ousted by 25 Presidents out of the 29 present member associations to approve a resolution made by 8 members of the Board of Governors calling for the ousting and replacement of Martinez as PFF president. Martinez was dismissed due to allegedly falsifying public documents and misusing funds. Mariano Araneta was named Interim President.

===Araneta era===
After serving as Interim President for about a year after Martinez&#x27;s ouster in 2010, Araneta was elected as president on 26 November 2011 at a PFF congress held at the Astoria Plaza in Pasig.

On 14 October 2016, at the Edsa Shangri-La Hotel in Pasig, the Online PFF Player Registration System was launched following a contract signing between the PFF, MMC Sportz Marketing and RSportz. The initiative by the PFF is among the first in Southeast Asia. The registration system will create a database of Filipino players which will be accessible to organizers of PFF-sanctioned tournaments. The registration system was planned to be online by November 2016.

In November 2016, Araneta announced that the PFF will move its headquarters to Carmona, Cavite in 2017 where an artificial football pitch is due to be finished within the month. The new location will also house a dormitory, a natural grass pitch and corporate offices.

The PFF&#x27;s registration system dubbed &quot;My PFF&quot; was officially launched in June 2017 and will be embedded in PFF&#x27;s website on 3 July 2017 to be more accessible for registrants.

A financial issue with the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) was resolved on September 14, 2018, when the PFF remitted amount of unliquidated financial assistance from the government agency. The scope of the financial aid covers the administrations of the PFF from past 1996 to 2010.

The PFF was given the right to hold AFC ‘A’ and AFC ‘B’ Diploma Courses in the Philippines by the Asian Football Confederation starting 2019. The federation launched its first esports tournament, the PFF eTrophy which featured the video game title &quot;FIFA 21&quot; in 2021.

On July 30, 2022, the groundbreaking ceremony for the new PPF headquarters in Carmona took place. In November 2022, the PFF decided to allow the expansion of its regional associations.

===Gutierrez era===
Araneta, bound to a two-term limit, ends his presidency. The PFF held an election on 25 November 2023 to determine its new set of officials. 

John Gutierrez of Bukidnon FA was elected as Araneta&#x27;s successor.
The other candidates were Filbert Alquiros of Stallion Laguna, and Henry Sabate of Davao-South RFA. Gutierrez garnered 30 out of 36 votes, with the other contenders receiving three votes each.

<doc id="1261889" wikidata="Q5592132" url="?curid=1261889" title="Grady Louis McMurtry">
<text>Grady Louis McMurtry (October 18, 1918 – July 12, 1985) was an American ceremonial magician, student of occult writer Aleister Crowley, and an adherent of Thelema. He is best known for reviving the fraternal organization Ordo Templi Orientis, which he headed from 1971 until his death in 1985.

==Early life and career==

He lived in various parts of Oklahoma and the Midwest, and graduated from high school in Valley Center, Kansas in 1937. He then moved to Southern California to study engineering at Pasadena Junior College, where he made friends with some students at the nearby California Institute of Technology. Among them was Jack Parsons, who shared his enthusiasm for science fiction, and who introduced him to Thelema. In 1941 McMurtry was initiated into the Minerval and I° of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), a secret society headed at the time by Aleister Crowley.

In February 1942, two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, McMurtry&#x27;s entire Reserve Officers Training Corps class was called to active duty, and he served as an officer in Ordnance. He took part in the invasion of Normandy, the liberation of France and Belgium, and the occupation of Germany. He was recalled to active duty to serve in the Korean War, eventually reaching the rank of major. He was recalled again for another tour of duty in Korea in the early 1960s. Six months prior to completing 30 years of Reserve service, he was mustered out as a lieutenant colonel during a RIF (Reduction In Force) and lost what would have been an earned pension. He continued his academic studies as a civilian between tours of duty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his A.B. in political science in 1948 and an M.A. in the discipline in 1955. His thesis for the latter degree examined the parallels between magic and Marxism. In a 1970 conversation with Jacques Vallée (who was flummoxed by McMurtry&#x27;s lengthy military career), McMurtry identified as a political liberal. He noted his opposition to Richard Nixon&#x27;s Middle East policies and characterized himself as &quot;a poet who happened to fight in two wars.&quot;

During World War II, especially when he was stationed in England in 1943 and the first half of 1944, McMurtry was able to meet with and become a personal student of Aleister Crowley, who elevated him to IX° of O.T.O., giving him the name &quot;Hymenaeus Alpha&quot; (which enumerates to 777) in November 1943.

In September and November 1944 (and once again in June 1947), he received letters from Crowley referring to him as Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Caliph&quot; (or successor). When McMurtry returned to California after the war he was appointed Crowley&#x27;s O.T.O. representative in the United States (April 1946), subject only to the authority of Crowley&#x27;s viceroy and heir apparent, Karl Germer.

Crowley died in December 1947, and Germer was recognized as the head of O.T.O. At the time the only functioning Thelemic O.T.O. body in the world was Agape Lodge in Southern California, which was headed for a time by McMurtry&#x27;s friend Jack Parsons. McMurtry planned to start a lodge in Northern California, but his deteriorating relationship with Karl Germer (based on Germer&#x27;s refusal to initiate new members) put an end to his plans. He tried to organize other O.T.O. members in California to lobby Germer to change his policy, but the situation came to a head at a meeting in 1959 in which Dr. Gabriel Montenegro (Germer&#x27;s representative) &quot;ordered&quot; McMurtry to cease his efforts. This order was reiterated in writing in November 1960. McMurtry unwillingly complied with the order, and he was disillusioned enough by this turn of events that he ended his direct involvement with O.T.O. In 1961 he moved to Washington, D.C., where he soon became completely out of touch with other O.T.O. members.

==Re-establishing O.T.O.==
On October 25, 1962 Germer died from prostatic cancer at the age of 77, without naming a successor as head of O.T.O. His widow, who was not a member of O.T.O., retained material possession of the O.T.O.&#x27;s extensive archives. Though individual members carried on with their spiritual activities, the central organization, for all intents and purposes, ceased to function.

There were a few individuals, notably Kenneth Grant of Britain, Hermann Metzger of Switzerland, and later, Marcelo Ramos Motta of Brazil, who claimed succession to Germer. McMurtry was unaware of any of these developments until 1968, when he received a letter from Phyllis Seckler, a fellow Agape Lodge O.T.O. initiate.

Seckler&#x27;s letter was to inform McMurtry that the archives in Germer&#x27;s widow&#x27;s care (including Aleister Crowley&#x27;s library) had been burglarized the previous year by persons unknown. When he became aware of the situation he decided to take charge of what remained of O.T.O. In 1969 he left his job at the United States Department of Labor and returned to California to investigate the burglary. Though the crime was never officially solved, McMurtry felt that it had probably been carried out by a group, claiming affiliation with O.T.O., that called itself the &quot;Solar Lodge&quot;. McMurtry had moved into Seckler&#x27;s home in Dublin, California, and soon they were married.

At this time, McMurtry decided to restore the Order by invoking his emergency orders from Crowley which gave him authority (subject to Karl Germer&#x27;s approval) to &quot;take charge of the whole work of the Order in California to reform the Organization&quot;, and he assumed the title &quot;Caliph of O.T.O.,&quot; as specified in Crowley&#x27;s letters to McMurtry from the 1940s. His witnesses were Dr. Israel Regardie (1907–1985) and Gerald Yorke, who both offered their support.

Along with Seckler and two other surviving members, Mildred Burlingame and Helen Parsons Smith, he slowly began performing O.T.O. initiations again. They also eventually succeeded in their efforts to find a publisher for the Thoth tarot deck designed by Aleister Crowley. O.T.O. was registered with the State of California on December 28, 1971 as a legal organization.

In 1974 McMurtry and Seckler separated, and he moved to Berkeley, California. Germer&#x27;s widow died in 1975, and in 1976 the surviving members of O.T.O. were enabled by court order to claim the still considerable archives. In October 1977 McMurtry founded Thelema Lodge in Berkeley to serve as the headquarters of his resuscitated O.T.O. Many initiations were performed, and a weekly celebration of the Gnostic Mass was soon established in the San Francisco Bay area. McMurtry, and other initiators chartered by him, established O.T.O. groups in many other areas in the United States and internationally. By 1985 O.T.O., by its own report, had more than seven hundred members in several different countries. In that year McMurtry, in failing health, successfully sued Motta in United States district court over the possession of the O.T.O. trademarks and copyrights. He died in a Martinez, California convalescent hospital on the day that the U.S. court clerk released the text of the decision that set the seal on McMurtry&#x27;s efforts to reestablish O.T.O. Since then O.T.O. had, by its own report, grown to over three thousand members in more than forty countries, although numbers have declined significantly over the last decade.

<doc id="1261899" wikidata="Q2931650" url="?curid=1261899" title="CKOF-FM">
<text>CKOF-FM (104.7 MHz) is a French-language commercial radio station in Gatineau, Quebec, serving the National Capital Region including Ottawa. Owned and operated by Cogeco, it broadcasts a talk radio format, calling itself &quot;104,7 FM&quot;. Some programming is shared with sister station CKOI-FM Montreal. The radio studios and offices are in the Chemin des Terres neighbourhood of Gatineau.

CKOF-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 31,000 watts, with a maximum of 100,000 watts. The transmitter is located in Camp Fortune, near Gatineau Park.

==History==

The station originally began broadcasting in 1968 on the AM band. It was CJRC, on 1150 kHz with a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 5,000 watts as a class B station. It used a directional antenna with slightly different daytime and nighttime directional patterns in order to protect various other stations on that frequency – particularly CKOC in Hamilton, Ontario.

The station was signed on the air on June 3, 1968 by Raymond Crepeau, Marcel Joyal, Robert Campeau and Gerard Moreau with the presence of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the then-prime minister of Canada (and father of future prime minister Justin Trudeau) as part of the Radiomutuel network. Originally its headquarters were at the Sparks Street Mall in Ottawa but were later moved in the old city of Gatineau in the 1980s after a stay on Belfast Road in Ottawa. It became part of the Radiomédia network (later known as Corus Québec) on September 30, 1994, after Radiomutuel merged with Télémédia (that network&#x27;s Gatineau station, CKCH, was closed down).

On November 24, 2006, the CRTC authorized the station to switch to the FM band. The change of frequency forced CHMY&#x27;s transmitter in Arnprior, formerly on 104.7, to move to 107.7 FM. The 104.7 MHz frequency was also used in Ottawa by 3077457 Nova Scotia Limited which was approved in 2005 to operate a tourist information station. The station, CIIO-FM later moved to 99.7 MHz in 2007. 

On April 16, 2007, at 7:00 a.m. EDT, CJRC made the move to the FM band on 104.7 MHz as CJRC-FM Le FM parlé de l&#x27;Outaouais.

On June 12, 2008, CJRC-FM received approval to increase power from 2,900 to 36,000 watts.

In March 2009, Corus announced plans to drop the talk radio format on CJRC, CHLT-FM in Sherbrooke, CHLN-FM in Trois-Rivières and CKRS-FM in Saguenay, in favour of a classic hits-oldies format branded as &quot;Souvenirs Garantis&quot;, effective on March 28, 2009. 

Since the implementation of the new CJRC-FM on 104.7 in 2007, the old 1150 AM has been simulcasting the programming of CJRC-FM which was originally to be shut down on March 16, 2009 although as of April 2009, the 1150 AM signal was still in operation. The old AM 1150 CJRC signal finally left the air on May 1, 2009. 
In early 2010, the local morning news show featuring Louis-Philippe Brûlé (previously before for several years by Daniel Séguin) was removed in favor of a provincial newscast broadcast from Montreal by Paul Arcand.

On December 17, 2010, the CRTC approved the sale of most of Corus Entertainment stations in Quebec, including CJRC-FM, to Cogeco.

On February 21, 2011, the station rebranded to CKOI 104.7, picking up the hot adult contemporary format and branding similar to its Montreal sister station, CKOI-FM and CJRC-FM change its callsign to CKOF-FM.

On June 20, 2012, Cogeco announced that CKOF-FM, along with CKOY-FM and CKOB-FM, will revert to their talk formats on August 20, 2012, all but dismantling the CKOI network. Apart from an expansion of talk programming, no changes in current talk and sports programming are expected for these stations.

<text>The Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada (CMAC) () hears appeals from Courts-martial of Canada (&quot;courts martial&quot;).

In Canada, courts martial are presided over by independent military judges from the office of the Chief Military Judge. They have the jurisdiction to try military personnel, and those civilian personnel that accompany military personnel abroad, for crimes that contravene the Code of Service Discipline and the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;; which incorporates many of the offences under the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and related statutes.

The CMAC was established in 1959 by Parliament under the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, to replace the Court Martial Appeal Board. Due to the court&#x27;s small caseload, justices of the CMAC are cross-appointed from justices of provincial superior courts and the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal. Appeals from the CMAC lie with the Supreme Court of Canada. Appeals require leave from the Supreme Court, unless a justice of the CMAC dissents on a question of law, in which case there is an appeal as of right to the Supreme Court.

<text>Dilara or Delara can be a given name or surname in several languages.

Delara (Persian: دل‌آرا-دلارا) is a Persian female first name popular in Iran and other Persian speaking countries such as Afghanistan and Tajikistan. 

Dilara is popular in Turkic countries such as Azerbaijan and Turkey. 

It is a compound word of Persian origin that consists of two parts: &quot;Del&quot;+&quot;-ara&quot;. In Persian, &quot;del&quot; (&quot;دل)&quot; is a noun meaning heart, and &quot;ara&quot; is a suffix that comes from the Persian verb &quot;ārāstan&quot; (آراستن), meaning adorner, beautifier, and embellisher. According to the &quot;Dehkhoda Dictionary&quot;, Dilara can be translated as &quot;she who delights the heart&quot;, &quot;she who is pleasing&quot; or &quot;what makes heart beautiful&quot;. 

Dilara or Delara can be also a variant of the Spanish or French habitational name Lara. 

In the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;), the masterpiece of Ferdowsi (940–1025), Dilara was a prudent and wise queen in the time of the ancient Persian Empire. For hundreds of years since then in Persian literature, poets such as Saadi have used the name &quot;Dilara&quot; to refer a dearly loved woman who fills their hearts with joy and happiness.

<doc id="1261916" wikidata="Q863226" url="?curid=1261916" title="Billy Squier">
<text>William Haislip Squier (, born May 12, 1950) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter who had a string of arena rock and crossover hits in the early 1980s. His best-known songs include &quot;The Stroke&quot;, &quot;Lonely Is the Night&quot;, &quot;My Kinda Lover&quot;, &quot;In the Dark&quot;, &quot;Rock Me Tonite&quot;, &quot;Everybody Wants You&quot;, &quot;Emotions in Motion&quot;, &quot;Love Is the Hero&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Say You Love Me&quot;. Squier&#x27;s best-selling album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No&quot;, is considered a landmark release of arena rock, bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.

Described as a personification of early 1980s rock music, Squier&#x27;s most successful period was from 1981 to 1984, during which he had five Top 10 Mainstream Rock hits (two of which were number ones), two Top 20 singles, three consecutive platinum-selling albums, and videos in MTV rotation. Even after falling out from mainstream favor and chart success, which some say is because of the 1984 video for &quot;Rock Me Tonite&quot;, Squier has maintained his presence on rock radio and his music used in many films and video games. Squier largely stopped recording music after the commercial failure of the 1993 album &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, but has continued to perform smaller tours, one-off concerts, and occasional collaborations.

His 1980 song &quot;The Big Beat&quot; contains one of the most-sampled drum breaks, used by artists such as Run-DMC, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, UTFO, and Dizzee Rascal. &quot;The Stroke&quot; is sampled in Eminem&#x27;s 2013 hit &quot;Berzerk&quot;.

==Career==

=== Early life and first bands (1950–1974) ===
Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he took piano lessons starting at age eight. Bored with the lessons after three years, his grandfather paid him to continue for a while longer. The only child became interested in guitar after a classmate sold him one for $90. Squier formed his first band, the Reltneys, when he was 14. He became more serious about music when he discovered John Mayall &amp; The Bluesbreakers.

Squier&#x27;s first public performances were in 1968 at a Boston nightclub in Kenmore Square named the Psychedelic Supermarket, where he saw Eric Clapton and the band Cream. This encouraged him to take music more seriously. He formed the band Magic Terry &amp; the Universe with a school friend. In the early 1970s, Squier played with the short lived bands Kicks, alongside future New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan. Squier also briefly attended Berklee College of Music in 1971. Squier was planning to become a teacher but instead went back to New York and played with the band the Sidewinders.

=== Piper and solo career (1975–1980) ===
In the mid-1970s, Squier encountered his first real experience with the music industry after striking a record deal with his new band Piper, which went on to release two studio records, &quot;Piper&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait.&quot; The band was praised by critics: reviewing the self-titled album, &quot;Circus&quot; magazine touted it as &quot;the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band&quot;. Piper was managed by the same management company as Kiss and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Squier served as both main songwriter and frontman of the group.

Despite receiving considerable success at the local rock scene, Piper broke up. Squier signed a solo deal with Capitol Records in 1979 and started working on his solo debut &quot;The Tale of the Tape&quot;, which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier&#x27;s first singles &quot;You Should Be High Love&quot; and &quot;The Big Beat&quot; missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. Along with Bobby Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar, and Mark Clarke (who previously had short jobs in Uriah Heep and Rainbow) on bass.

=== Commercial success: &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No&quot; and &quot;Emotions in Motion&quot; (1981–1983) ===
Following a small but fairly successful summer tour with Alice Cooper in 1980, Squier got in contact with Queen guitarist Brian May and asked him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended Reinhold Mack, who had produced Queen&#x27;s most recent album &quot;The Game.&quot; Squier and Mack joined forces to produce &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No&quot;, which earned rave reviews and spawned three hit singles. The first, &quot;The Stroke,&quot; became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia, as well as charting high in Canada and in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. &quot;In the Dark&quot; and &quot;My Kinda Lover&quot; were successful follow-ups. The album also includes &quot;Lonely Is the Night&quot;, which became a radio favorite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was the B-side for &quot;In the Dark&quot;). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No&quot; peaked at #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone, making it Squier&#x27;s most commercially successful album.

Squier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences. Despite the problems, Squier&#x27;s third album &quot;Emotions In Motion&quot; was released in 1982 and became very successful, although in the long run, it didn&#x27;t catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies, and spawned the successful radio and video hits &quot;Emotions in Motion&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants You&quot;. The latter is notable for being Squier&#x27;s first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. During the tour for &quot;Emotions in Motion&quot;, Squier and his band served as openers for the North American leg of Queen&#x27;s 1982 Hot Space Tour and later, he finally became a headliner act for the first time. British newcomer Def Leppard supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album &quot;Pyromania&quot;.

=== Career pinnacle: &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (1984) ===
Squier began writing songs for his fourth album &quot;Signs of Life&quot; in late 1983 after finishing his first headlining arena tour. He planned to have Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange as producer. However, Lange was already reserved by The Cars and suffered a breakdown afterward. Squier brought in Jim Steinman, whom he admired for Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, which he described as &quot;the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time&quot;. Steinman showed enthusiasm for the project and he got along well with Squier and his band, despite his role in the studio being significantly smaller than usual. The resulting album was a departure from Squier&#x27;s typical guitar-heavy hard rock into a more keyboard-oriented style, with hints of Steinman&#x27;s Wagnerian producing approach.

When &quot;Signs of Life&quot; arrived in late July 1984, Squier was at the peak of his career. Fueled by the songs &quot;Rock Me Tonite&quot; and &quot;All Night Long&quot;, the album brought his third consecutive platinum certification. The music video for &quot;Rock Me Tonite&quot;, which featured Squier dancing in a bedroom wearing a pink tank top, proved a controversial choice by director Kenny Ortega. The 2011 book &quot;I Want My MTV&quot; promoted it as the worst video of all time. Martha Quinn, an MTV VJ when &quot;Rock Me Tonite&quot; was released, commented, &quot;I don’t remember that video being poorly received at the time.&quot; Whether it was the video or the shift in music style or other factors, Squier stopped selling out shows. He dismissed both of his managers and insulted Ortega for misleading and deceiving him. Ortega has denied Squier&#x27;s accusations.

=== Brief resurgence (1985–1993) ===
Apart from a few live appearances and a new song, &quot;Shake Down&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, Squier stayed out of the spotlight for the majority of 1985, taking some time off and preparing his next album with British producer Peter Collins, who was known for his work with Nik Kershaw, Gary Moore, and Rush. 1986 saw the release of his fifth album &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;, which was carefully crafted, but still a commercial flop. The album spawned a minor hit, &quot;Love Is the Hero&quot;, with Freddie Mercury on backing vocals. Mercury also co-wrote and arranged the song &quot;Lady with a Tenor Sax&quot;, which also appears on the album. &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; sold an estimated 300,000 copies. &quot;Love Is the Hero&quot; has usually been singled out for praise. Squier did not embark on a tour in support of the album.

Squier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length album, &quot;Hear &amp; Now&quot;, which was released in 1989. The album peaked at #64, but sold only 300,000, the same as &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Say You Love Me&quot; was a modestly successful comeback single and his last Hot 100 hit, which peaked at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

Squier&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Creatures of Habit&quot;, was released in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired, mainly on the songwriting side. Some also found the album&#x27;s polished sound somewhat outdated, since at the time of the album&#x27;s release, alternative rock and especially grunge began ruling the rock scene. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since &quot;The Tale of the Tape&quot;. However, it contained the radio hits, &quot;She Goes Down&quot; and &quot;Facts of Life&quot;. The former is Squier&#x27;s last Top 5 on the Mainstream Rock charts and his highest charting radio single of the 1990s. &quot;Creatures of Habit&quot; was supported with a tour.

In 1993, Squier released his final album with Capitol Records, &quot;Tell the Truth,&quot; with different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favorably to &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No,&quot; Capitol did little to nothing to promote it, which ended up becoming his first album not to chart at all and selling 37,000 US copies, per Nielsen Soundscan. After the album&#x27;s release, Squier departed from the record label.

=== Later career (1994–present) ===
In 1994, Squier&#x27;s original screenplay &quot;Run to Daylight&quot; was short-listed at the Sundance Film Festival. The film itself was never produced. In 1995, Capitol released &quot;16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier&quot;.

On February 17, 1998, during the initial run of &quot;,&quot; a monodrama about the life of Freddie Mercury, Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend, titled &quot;I Have Watched You Fly&quot;, on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, &quot;I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I&#x27;m honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.&quot;

That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped-down acoustic blues effort titled &quot;Happy Blue.&quot; The album was both stylistically and sonically a departure from his typical hard rock sound, with only Squier accompanied by an acoustic guitar and no overdubs. For this album, Squier reworked his hit song &quot;The Stroke&quot; into an old-fashioned blues number, &quot;Stroke Me Blues&quot;.

The year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No.&quot; In the same year, Squier embarked on a large concert tour.

In 2004, &quot;Everybody Wants You&quot; was remixed with the group Fischerspooner&#x27;s song &quot;Emerge&quot; and included on the &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined Richard Marx, Edgar Winter, Rod Argent, Hamish Stuart, and Sheila E touring with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Ronnie Spector, Mitch Ryder, Tone Loc, Deniece Williams, Dr. Hook, and Tom Cochrane. In 2008, Squier joined Colin Hay, Edgar Winter, Gary Wright, Hamish Stuart, and Gregg Bissonette touring with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke, and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.

Squier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King&#x27;s in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of &quot;Everybody Wants You,&quot; &quot;Nobody Knows,&quot; &quot;Learn How to Live,&quot; &quot;Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,&quot; and most of the Happy Blue project. Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as &quot;one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.&quot;

In May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to James Cotton including Magic Dick (J. Geils Band), the James Montgomery Band, Jon Butcher, Sib Hashian (Boston), Michael Carabello (Santana), the Uptown Horns, and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton&#x27;s invitation in June to join him at the &quot;James Cotton&#x27;s Blues Summit&quot; at Lincoln Center in New York City, along with Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin (Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s band), Taj Mahal, and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the Iridium in New York and played a double set that night, &quot;Blues Deluxe,&quot; that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.

Shout! Factory released &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No: 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection. That same year, all his albums except &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Happy Blue&quot;, became available on digital and streaming. Later on, &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; joined in 2014 and &quot;Happy Blue&quot; in 2020.

In October 2011, Squier performed at the third annual &quot;Right to Rock&quot; Celebration at the Edison Ballroom in New York (including Steven van Zandt and Lady Gaga) in support of the Little Kids Rock charity and performed &quot;Lonely Is the Night&quot; with a group of Jersey City students.

In May 2012, Squier joined the Li&#x27;l Band O&#x27; Gold for several shows at the New Orleans Jazzfest. During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, New York, in support of his friend, rock photographer Rob Shanahan and his new book, &quot;Volume One.&quot; In June, Squier performed at the &quot;Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner&quot; in New York, in another fundraising effort for &#x27;Little Kids Rock.&#x27; In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for &quot;The American Revolution,&quot; a documentary on the rock FM station WBCN at the House of Blues in Boston.

In the summer of 2013, Squier performed his &#x27;Electric Man&#x27; show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with Iggy Pop&#x27;s band), joined Squier on &quot;The Stroke.&quot; At the same time, Eminem released &#x27;Berzerk&#x27;, which makes use of various samples from &quot;The Stroke.&quot; On his 2014 effort &quot;Shady XV&quot;, Eminem sampled &quot;My Kinda Lover.&quot;

In September 2014, Squier took his &#x27;Electric Man&#x27; show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, California.

On February 14, 2023, a clip of a new track titled &quot;Molly&quot; was uploaded, with March 8 noted in the video. The song was ultimately released as &quot;Harder on a Woman&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1985, Squier hired a helicopter from the Prince of Nepal and offered $10,000 in cash to two helicopter pilots to land him on the summit of Mount Everest. They turned him down, saying that it was too dangerous.

In 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a German professional soccer player. They divided their time between a home in Bridgehampton, Long Island and an apartment in The San Remo on Central Park West in Manhattan, New York City. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the Central Park Conservancy for more than 17 years, physically maintaining of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.

<text>The Manawatū River is a major river of the lower North Island of New Zealand. The river flows from the Ruahine Ranges, through both the Manawatū Gorge and the city of Palmerston North, and across the Manawatū Plains to the Tasman Sea at Foxton.

== Name ==
The river, along with the more northern Whanganui River, gives its name to the Manawatū-Whanganui region. The name of the river was given by the tohunga Haupipi-a-Nanaia, a descendant of Haunui-a-paparangi. Haupipi-a-Nanaia or Hau, travelled down the west coast in pursuit of his wife Wairaka, who had eloped. When Hau reached what is now known as the Manawatū River, he is said to have stopped and clutched his chest, horrified at the prospect of crossing so mighty an expanse of water. Therefore the river&#x27;s name comes from the Māori words &quot;manawa&quot; (heart) and &quot;tū&quot; (stand still). In this context, when said together, the interpretation is ‘heart standing still’ to represent how Hau felt when he first saw the river. However cross he did, and a few kilometres south of Paekākāriki, Hau overtook the fugitives and changed Wairaka into a rock.

==Geography==
The Manawatū River has its headwaters northwest of Norsewood in the Tararua District, on the eastern slopes of the Ruahine Range on the North Island of New Zealand. It flows initially eastward before turning south-west near Ormondville, flowing before turning north-west near Woodville. At this point it enters the Manawatū Gorge, between the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges. Beyond the gorge it joins with the Pohangina River at Ashhurst and turns south-west, flowing through the city of Palmerston North. At this stage the river is still flowing swiftly and carrying gravel from the mountains.

After Opiki, it slows and has a lower gradient, meandering over the Manawatu Plains; its bed at this point is mud and silty sand. In its meandering and frequent shifting of course it has created oxbow lakes, lagoons, and swamps. Sediment deposited along its course has created levees, higher than the surrounding plain; when the river is in flood it overflows these and creates wetlands. The Manawatū reaches the Tasman Sea at Foxton Beach, on the west coast of the North Island, creating the Manawatu Estuary.

Major tributaries of the river include the Mākākahi, Mangahao, Pohangina and Oroua Rivers. The Manawatū&#x27;s total length is , making it only the 12th-longest in the country, but at it is one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest rivers in terms of flow, and second only to the Waikato River among North Island rivers.

=== Bridges ===
The river is crossed by 18 road bridges (not including the under-construction Parahaki Island Bridge), 3 rail bridges and He Ara Kotahi walk/cycleway. The lowest and longest, Whirokino Trestle and Manawatū River Bridge, carry SH1 over the Moutoa Floodway and over the river. It replaced the 1938 and 1942 bridges in February 2020, at a cost of $70m.

== Geology ==
The Manawatū is unique among New Zealand rivers in that it crosses a mountain range. The river has formed a &quot;water gap&quot; across the mountains because it is older than the Ruahine and Tararua Ranges. Most rivers arise from an already-existing range of mountains or hills, but beginning about 3 million years ago the central North Island mountain ranges began to uplift across the Manawatū&#x27;s current course. Because it drained a large catchment, the river had sufficient flow to keep pace with and erode the rising mountains, eventually forming the Manawatū Gorge; other rivers were unable to and were diverted into the Manawatū instead.

After exiting the Manawatū Gorge, the river carries rock and sediment down from the mountains. During glacial times, with the prevalence of ice, snow, and bare mountains, this erosion increases and forms a stony elevated terrace. During an interglacial, while the mountains are forested, gravel outwash is reduced and the river cuts down into the terrace, forming a gorge. This cycle has created four distinct terraces between the Manawatū Gorge and Palmerston North.

The Manawatū Plain was seabed 5 to 6 million years ago, and as it was raised above water by the action of the Australian and Pacific Plates it buckled, forming five long and low ridges (or anticlines) parallel to the mountains, which impede the flow of the Manawatū, Rangitikei, and Oroua Rivers, forcing them to flow southwest rather than directly into the Tasman Sea.

== Vegetation ==
At the time of human arrival, the Manawatū Plains were covered with forest. Towards the foothills and the Manawatū Gorge grew black beech, turning into tawa forest at lower altitudes. Along the plains and terraces the forest was mixed podocarp and tōtara, changing to mixed tawa, tītoki, and māhoe in the sand dunes.

Across the flood plain of the Manawatū and on the low-lying land bordering the river, the predominant vegetation was semi-swamp forest, mostly kahikatea and pukatea. Three major swamps bordered the Manawatū: Moutoa Swamp north of the river, towards the mouth, known as the &quot;Great Swamp&quot; in the 19th century; Makerua Swamp further inland, to the south of the Manawatū and north of the Tokomaru River, which covered 22000 acres; and Taonui Swamp on the north side of the river. The main vegetation in the swamps was harakeke and raupō: harakeke in the drier parts, raupō in the wetter.

The Manawatū river mouth and estuary was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Importance in 2005.

== Flooding ==
The Manawatū River flooded in February 2004, displacing over 3000 people (primarily from Marton and Feilding) and damaging over 1000 Manawatū farms. The cost of the flood in terms of insurance payouts was NZ$122 million. Further damage was prevented by the opening of the Moutoa floodgates, which intercept the river between Foxton and Shannon.

==Water quality==
In 2018 a case study on water quality in the Manawatū-Whanganui region was jointly commissioned by Horizons Regional Council and the Ministry for the Environment, the study was conducted by Land Water People (LWP) and the results were reviewed by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and StatsNZ. Results showed that water quality for sediment and &quot;E. coli&quot; had improved over the previous seven to ten years in the Manawatū-Whanganui region. The report found strong statistical evidence of a connection between regional scale water quality improvements and local scale interventions.

In 2006 Fonterra were criticised for an application to discharge of wastewater into the Manawatū River. In 2009, the Cawthron Institute found that the river had the highest gross primary production (GPP) compared to 300 rivers and streams in the Western world. High GPP rates are an indication of poor ecological health and can lead to various environmental issues. In 2011, the Horizons Regional Council laid blame with the Palmerston North City Council for &quot;considerable&quot; and &quot;sustained&quot; breaches of one of its discharge consents, and some degree of non-compliance with two others. A report by the Ministry for the Environment ranked 76 New Zealand sites for water clarity and &quot;E. coli&quot; levels. Using those measures, they found only four other New Zealand rivers rate worse than the Manawatū (the Waitara, Whanganui, Waipā and Rangitīkei).

<text>Felix Nussbaum (11 December 1904 – after 20 September 1944) was a German-Jewish surrealist painter. Nussbaum&#x27;s paintings, including &quot;Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card&quot; (1943) and &quot;Triumph of Death&quot; (1944), explore his experiences as a Jew during the Holocaust. His work is usually associated with the New Objectivity movement, and was influenced by the works of Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Rousseau, and Vincent van Gogh. He took refuge in Belgium after the Nazi rise to power, but was deported to Auschwitz along with his wife Felka Platek only a few months before the British liberation of Brussels on 3 September 1944.

== Early life and education ==
Nussbaum was born in Osnabrück, Germany, to parents Rahel and Philipp Nussbaum. His father was a World War I veteran and German patriot before the rise of the Nazis. He was an amateur painter in his youth, but financial difficulties forced him to pursue more traditional work. This experience is said to have influenced him to encourage his son to pursue art as a profession.

Nussbaum was a lifelong student, beginning his formal studies in 1920 in Hamburg and Berlin, and continuing as long as the tempestuous political situation allowed him. In his earlier works, Nussbaum was heavily influenced by Vincent van Gogh and Henri Rousseau, later taking influence from Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carrà as well. Nussbaum&#x27;s careful approach to color may have been influenced by expressionist Karl Hofer.

In 1933, Nussbaum was studying under a scholarship in Rome at the Berlin Academy of the Arts when the Nazis seized control of Germany. When Adolf Hitler sent his Minister of Propaganda to Rome in April to disseminate Nazi artistic values, particularly the celebration of the Aryan race, Nussbaum realized that, as a Jew, he could not remain at the academy.

== Exile and hiding ==

The next decade of Nussbaum&#x27;s life was characterized by fear, which is reflected in his artwork. While studying in Berlin, Nussbaum met painter Felka Platek; they would later marry in Brussels during their shared exile. In 1934, he took Platek to meet his parents in Switzerland. Felix&#x27;s parents eventually grew homesick for Germany and, against his fierce objections, they returned. This was the last time Felix would see his mother and fatherthe source of his spiritual and financial support. Felix and Felka would spend the next ten years in exile, mostly in Belgium, a period of emotional and artistic isolation for him but also one of the most artistically productive times in his life.

After Nazi Germany attacked Belgium in 1940, Nussbaum was arrested by Belgian police as a &quot;hostile alien&quot; German, and was subsequently taken to the Saint-Cyprien camp in France. The desperate circumstances in the camp influenced his work during this time. He eventually signed a request to the French camp authorities to be returned to Germany. On the train ride from Saint-Cyprien to Germany, he managed to escape and settled with Felka in occupied Belgium, and they began a life in hiding. Without residency papers, Nussbaum had no way of earning an income, but friends provided him with shelter and art supplies so that he could continue his craft. In 1943 he painted &quot;The Self Portrait with a Jewish identity card.&quot; In the painting there is a tree (&quot;Nussbaum&quot; translates to &quot;nut tree&quot; in English) whose branches are cut, with one branch bearing blossoms.

==Deportation and murder==

In the space of a single year, Nussbaum&#x27;s entire family was murdered in the Holocaust. His parents, Philipp and Rahel, were murdered at Auschwitz in February, and in July Nussbaum and his wife were found hiding in an attic by German armed forces. They were arrested, sent to the Mechelen transit camp and given the numbers XXVI/284 and XXVI/285. On 2 August, they arrived at Auschwitz, and his wife was likely murdered upon arrival, while Nussbaum was assigned prisoner number B-3594. On 3 September, Nussbaum&#x27;s brother was sent to Auschwitz, and on 6 September his sister-in-law and niece were also murdered there. In December, his brother died from exhaustion in the camp at Stutthof.

In 1955, Nussbaum was declared legally dead with 9 August 1944 selected as his date of death.

In 2014, researchers at the Russian state archives in Moscow identified a report from the Auschwitz infirmary dated 20 September 1944 that showed Nussbaum was treated for a blister on his left index finger. Nussbaum was not among the prisoners present on 27 January 1945 during the liberation of Auschwitz, and there are no known records of transfer to a separate concentration camp, leading researchers to conclude Nussbaum was murdered between 20 September 1944 and 27 January 1945.

==Major works==
In this time period, Nussbaum created two of his best-known works: &quot;Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card&quot; (1943), and &quot;Triumph of Death&quot; (1944).

=== &quot;Triumph of Death&quot; ===
&quot;Triumph of Death&quot; shows Nussbaum&#x27;s attention to detail. According to his biography, &quot;Felix Nussbaum: Art Defamed; Art in Exile; Art in Resistance&quot;, the crumpled music score has the first several bars of &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot;, a popular song from the musical &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;. The words that would normally accompany the music are &quot;Ev&#x27;rythin&#x27; free and easy / Do as you darn well pleasey&quot;.

==Selected paintings==
== Legacy ==
Felix Nussbaum&#x27;s artwork reflects and interprets his experiences as a victim of the Holocaust. In 1998, the Felix Nussbaum Haus in Osnabrück opened to permanently exhibit his works.

He was featured alongside fellow concentration camp survivors and artists Jan Komski and Dinah Gottliebova in the 1999 documentary film &quot;Eyewitness&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject.

&quot;Art and Remembrance: The Legacy of Felix Nussbaum&quot; is a 1993 documentary directed by Barbara Pfeffer.

<text>The following media outlets are located in Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region, serving the cities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. The two cities, which are adjacent and each receive virtually all television and radio stations operating in either city, are considered a single media market.

Most of the region&#x27;s FM and TV stations, regardless of which community they are officially licensed to, transmit from Camp Fortune in the Gatineau Hills. Other TV stations transmit from a tower located in Manotick, in the rural south portion of Ottawa. Ryan Tower, the former transmitter tower at Camp Fortune, was taken down on November 4, 2012 and its services and some antenna elements were transferred to a new, nearby tower.

In addition to the market&#x27;s local media services, Ottawa is also home to several national media operations, including CPAC (Canada&#x27;s national legislature broadcaster), the digital political newspaper &quot;iPolitics&quot;, and the parliamentary bureau staff of all of Canada&#x27;s major newsgathering organizations in television, radio and print. The city is also home to the legal headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, although operational headquarters for English- and French-language services are located in Toronto and Montreal, respectively.

==Radio==

*Some Montreal AM radio stations can also be heard in the area, such as CKGM 690, CKAC 730, and CJAD 800 as well as CKOI-FM in the far eastern parts of Ottawa.

===Defunct radio stations===
===AM===

*540 AM CJSB, a Ottawa-based radio station that launched in 1982 until it left the air in 1994. The station relaunched on FM at 106.9 MHz as CKQB-FM.

*Mix FM, was an unlicensed radio station in the Ottawa area that operated on various frequencies, mostly 91.9 FM in 2009, until it was shut down in 2010.
*96.5 CFDT-FM (east side) and 99.9 CFDT-FM-1 (west side), very low-power tourist information radio stations that served motorists along Highway 417. It is uncertain when or if these stations were ever in operation.
*96.5 FM was also used in 2002 for a special event radio programming at 96.5 MHz in Gatineau with the call sign CIRC.
*CIIO-FM, operated over various frequencies on 104.7 FM, 99.7 FM and 97.5, a tourist information station owned by Instant Information Services has been off the air since 2011.

*CKO &quot;(CKO-1)&quot; 106.9 FM was the Ottawa affiliate of the national CKO all-news network which ceased operations in 1989.

==Television==
Despite being one of Canada&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas, many of the &quot;local&quot; stations serving Ottawa–Gatineau are, in fact, based in the Greater Toronto Area. Notably, the country&#x27;s #2 and #3 private-sector broadcast networks, Global and Citytv, respectively, rely on repeaters of their Toronto-based stations, not originating stations, to serve Ottawa viewers. Despite this, however, Ottawa–Gatineau is unique among Canadian television markets, as the only market in all of Canada which has terrestrial access to virtually the entire range of Canadian broadcast networks and systems in both English and French — the larger Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver media markets each &quot;lack&quot; over-the-air access to some of the services in their market&#x27;s minority language. The sole exception is aboriginal network APTN, which only has broadcast coverage in the North, but is carried on cable in Ottawa and indeed throughout the country.

Of the fourteen stations available over the air, only six actually originate from the area and provide local news. These six stations are currently owned by only three companies, with two stations apiece: the CBC (with stations for its English and French networks), RNC Media (which owns the local affiliates of the two private French-language networks, TVA and Noovo), and Bell Media (which owns stations associated with its CTV and CTV 2 networks).

Both of the CBC stations carry local evening newscasts in their respective languages. The two Bell Media-owned stations, while nominally maintaining separate news operations, do not currently compete against each other for local news; CTV airs local newscasts at midday and in the evening, while CTV 2 only broadcasts a morning newscast. As for the RNC Media stations, the TVA affiliate carries a local evening newscast, whereas the Noovo affiliate only airs short local news updates.

===Defunct television stations===
* CFVO-TV channel 30—the region&#x27;s first TVA affiliate; broadcast from 1974 to 1977
* CKXT-DT-3 channel 20—local repeater of CKXT-DT Toronto; broadcast from 2008 to 2011

<doc id="1261943" wikidata="Q2931461" url="?curid=1261943" title="CHOT-DT">
<text>CHOT-DT (channel 32), branded as , is a television station in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, serving the National Capital Region as an affiliate of TVA. The station is owned by RNC Media, as part of a twinstick with Noovo affiliate CFGS-DT (channel 34). The two stations share studios on Rue Jean-Proulx and Rue Buteau in the former city of Hull; CHOT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec.

CHOT-DT is the largest TVA station that is not owned and operated by the network. It is also the largest network affiliate in Canada in a media market that is not owned by its associated network.

==History==
From 1974 to 1977, the Ottawa–Hull area received TVA programming from CFVO-TV (channel 30), which was the first French-language commercial station in the National Capital Region. CFVO was cooperatively owned and constantly struggled financially. After its March 1977 closure, Radio-Québec bought the channel 30 physical plant directly from CFVO&#x27;s creditors. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) then invited bids for a new French-language commercial station to be affiliated with TVA and operate on channel 40. Though as many as four bids were rumoured to be incoming for the TVA affiliate, the CRTC only received two, from Télé-Métropole (owner of TVA flagship station CFTM in Montreal) and Radio-Nord. The CRTC selected the application from Radio-Nord in December; CHOT, known as &quot;Télé-Outaouais&quot;, began operations on October 27, 1978. Pierre Thibault, who had been a temporary manager for CFVO late in the station&#x27;s life, served as its first general manager.

For a time until the late 1990s, CHOT was branded as &quot;CHOT 40&quot;, referring to the station&#x27;s channel number over the air. CHOT was one of the last television stations in Canada to use its over-the-air channel number in station branding. It is currently branded as &quot;&quot;.

==Cable distribution==
The station is carried on channel 4 by Vidéotron in Gatineau and on channel 10 by Rogers Cable in Ottawa.

CHOT is also carried by most of EastLink&#x27;s cable systems in Northeastern Ontario, one of the only regions in English Canada that carries an affiliate station instead of the national feed of CFTM-DT. It has been available on cable in this region since the early 1980s, long before TVA carriage was mandated nationwide. Predecessor companies Northern Cable and Persona picked up CHOT due to the area&#x27;s large Franco-Ontarian population, and continued to carry CHOT rather than switching providers.

==News operation==

 broadcasts a 30-minute local newscast every weekday at 6 p.m. and, as of 2019, a 17-minute local newscast at 12:13 p.m. In the past, CHOT had local news on weekends and a 15-minute noon newscast on weekdays, but recent cuts made by RNC Media had these newscasts replaced with Montreal-based TVA network news programs.

==Digital television and high definition==
After the analog television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CHOT-TV flash cut to digital maintaining operations on UHF channel 40. As part of the UHF spectrum repack, CHOT-DT was required to move broadcast frequencies by July 2020. CHOT-DT moved to UHF channel 32 in July 2020; CHOT-DT was to display as virtual channel 40, but displays as 32.

<doc id="1261950" wikidata="Q606104" url="?curid=1261950" title="Dayi method">
<text>Dayi (, literally &quot;great ease&quot;) is a system for entering Chinese characters on a standard QWERTY keyboard using a set of 46 character components. A character is built by combining up to four of the 46 characters (the other six are provided for typing Taiwanese addresses), using a system similar to that of Cangjie, but is decomposed in stroke order instead of in geometric shape in Cangjie.

On most keyboards in Taiwan, most keys show four symbols. On the keys, the Latin letters are in the upper left, Bopomofo symbols on the upper right, Cangjie symbols on the lower left, and Dayi symbols on the lower right.

==Layout==
Like Cangjie, every radical has some auxiliary shapes; but some of the auxiliary shapes of one radical originate from the mnemonic word of the radical. For example, key 6 is mapped to 車(car) in the keyboard, its mnemonic word is &quot;6片車門&quot;(six pieces of car door), and its auxiliary shapes include &quot;片&quot;(piece), &quot;爿&quot;(old character for &quot;wall&quot;, its shape is the reflection of &quot;片&quot;), &quot;甫&quot;(its shape is like &quot;車&quot;), &quot;門&quot;(door), &quot;鬥&quot;(to battle or to fight, its shape is like &quot;門&quot;).


==Methodology==
The following are rules of the Dayi input method:
# Input is with accordance to Chinese writing stroke order: &quot;top first, then bottom&quot;, &quot;left first, then right&quot;.
# For characters made of more than 4 symbols, enter the first three and the last symbol.&lt;br&gt;For instance, &quot;壽&quot; (士乛工口手舟) is represented by just 4 symbols: 士乛工舟 (FBR.).
# For symmetrical characters, enter the center followed by either side.&lt;br&gt;For instance, &quot;巫&quot; is represented by 工人人 (RAA).
# &quot;臼&quot; (W) is the wildcard key for the top part of words regardless of the contents:&lt;br&gt;Examples:&lt;br&gt;兒 = 臼儿 (WQ)&lt;br&gt;與 = 臼一八 (WE8)&lt;br&gt;覺 = 臼冖目儿 (WM3Q)

==Sample Learning Technique==
One common frustration of learning any Chinese input method is not knowing the correct sequence of keys to enter. This problem can be alleviated with the help of an answer table. The following technique can be used to familiarize oneself with the Dayi keyboard layout. Speed and proficiency will develop with additional practice.
This technique can be used with other input methods as well using similar lookup tables as answers.

* Find a source of commonly used Chinese vocabulary to type. This can may be found on the Internet by usage frequency or HSK level. For Dayi, use the list of Chinese Traditional words.&lt;br&gt;(Also see List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese)
* Navigate to a lookup table to use as an answer key.&lt;br&gt;For Dayi [with 4 keystrokes or less], dayin4.cin is publicly available on the Internet at various open-source repositories (see external links).
* Using the annotated image of the Dayi keyboard layout, look for the radicals that make up the character.&lt;br&gt;Enter them according to the methodology.
* If the character is not successfully entered, search the answer table for the desired sequence of keystrokes.&lt;br&gt;Try to understand why those keystrokes are used.&lt;br&gt;Note that there may be more than one answer for conciseness.&lt;br&gt;醫 = 匚牛大酉 (R2V8),&lt;br&gt;It can be condensed into 匚酉 (R8) since it does not conflict with other words in the dictionary.
* Repeat with roughly 150 words in the word list.
* Repeat with roughly the next 150 word in the word list.&lt;br&gt;If possible, this time avoid turning to the annotated layout of the Dayi keyboard.
* After successful practice, about 300 items have been entered.&lt;br&gt;The locations of many common radicals (such as 日一言木土) would be quite familiar.

==Comparison with other Chinese input methods==
The keyboard layout for the Dayi input method contains keys for many of the Kangxi radicals in its entirety. This means that a single keystroke accounts for the left half or right half of many Chinese characters. For instance, &quot;車&quot; in &quot;輸&quot; (6AJN) is represented by &quot;6&quot;. This allows for characters to be represented by 4 keys or less. In comparison, in Cangjie, &quot;車&quot; in &quot;輸&quot; (JJOMN) is represented by &quot;JJ&quot; for &quot;十十&quot;, thus requiring up to 5 keys per Chinese character. A user of Cangjie would require experience and attention to decomposition rules to notice that the &quot;田&quot; segments of the Kangxi radical are omitted.

Unlike other input methods, Dayi&#x27;s use of 46 character components instead of 26 happens to be its greatest impediment, because it makes typing digits and punctuation marks very inconvenient.

<text>Nevado Ojos del Salado is a dormant complex volcano in the Andes on the Argentina–Chile border. It is the highest volcano on Earth and the highest peak in Chile. The upper reaches of Ojos del Salado consist of several overlapping lava domes, lava flows and volcanic craters, with sparse ice cover. The complex extends over an area of and its highest summit reaches an altitude of above sea level. Numerous other volcanoes rise around Ojos del Salado.

Being close to the Arid Diagonal of South America, the mountain has extremely dry conditions, which prevent the formation of substantial glaciers and a permanent snow cover. Despite the arid climate, there is a permanent crater lake about in diameter at an elevation of - within the summit crater and east of the main summit. This is the highest lake of any kind in the world. Owing to its altitude and the desiccated climate, the mountain lacks vegetation.

Ojos del Salado was volcanically active during the Pleistocene and Holocene, during which it mainly produced lava flows. Activity was in two phases and a depression or caldera formed in the course of its growth. The volcano was also impacted by eruptions of its neighbour to the west, Nevado Tres Cruces. The last eruption occurred around 750 CE; steam emissions observed in November 1993 may have constituted another eruptive event.

An international highway between Argentina and Chile crosses north of the mountain. Ojos del Salado can be ascended from both countries; the first ascent was made in 1937 by Jan Alfred Szczepański and , members of a Polish expedition in the Andes. During the middle of the 20th century there was a debate on whether Ojos del Salado or Aconcagua was the highest mountain in South America which was eventually resolved in favour of Aconcagua.

== Name ==

The name refers to a river, Río Salado (&quot;Salty River&quot;), that a 1937 Polish expedition used to reach the mountain. It is unclear whether the name was already used before by a Chile-Argentina boundary commission. In geographical terms, Ojo is commonly used in Chile and Argentina to denote a spring or source of water; e.g. the nearby source of the Las Lozas river &quot;Ojo de las Lozas&quot;.

The mountain is often referred to as Ojos del Salado and Ojos del Salado; the former is a common term for &quot;mountain&quot; in Chile and the latter means &quot;snowy&quot;, referring to snow-covered mountains. There are two summits, known as the eastern or Argentine and western or Chilean summit; both lie along the international boundary and get their names after the country from which they can be more easily reached.

== Geography and geomorphology ==

Ojos del Salado is part of the High Andes and rises from the southern end of the Puna de Atacama, a high plateau next to the Atacama Desert with an average elevation of . The border between Argentina and Chile runs across the summit of the mountain in east-west direction. The Argentine part is within Catamarca Province and the Chilean in Copiapo Province of the Atacama Region. The highway runs between the city of Copiapo west of the volcano and the Paso San Francisco to Argentina, lying about north of the volcano, making it more accessible than many other volcanoes there. The region is uninhabited and lacks water resources; many parts are only accessible through dirt roads.

Ojos del Salado is a dormant volcano that rises to , or elevation. It is the world&#x27;s highest volcano and the second-highest summit of the Andes, and the highest summit in Chile. Ojos del Salado is not a single conical summit but a massif/complex volcano formed by overlapping smaller volcanoes, with over 20 craters. Two edifices, less than wide, flank the summit crater on its eastern and western side. Basalt, gravel, pumice and scoria crop out in its rim, which is lower on the northern side. A second crater lies just west of the summit crater. Reportedly, the summit is separated by a deep gap into two separate peaks. Thick short dacitic lava flows make up the core area of the volcano but pyroclastic fall material covers much of the summit area.

The massif rises about above the surrounding terrain and covers an oval area of about –, consisting of lava domes, lava flows, pyroclastic cones and volcanic craters that rise about above the surrounding terrain. The massif appears to feature a buried caldera, visible through a slope break from the western side, and/or a depression. The occurrence of a rift-like structure with numerous small craters has also been reported. Volcanic cones form a north-northeast trending alignment on the western flank. Cerro Solo and El Fraile are large lava domes on the flanks of Ojos del Salado, and produced pyroclastic flows.

Wind-driven erosion has produced megaripple sand fields on the northern flank. Above elevation talus-covered slopes and lava flows form the bulk of the surface, while the desert plains begin below elevation. The ground above elevation is expected to contain permafrost, which is likely continuous at higher elevations and overlaid with a thin active layer. Cryoturbation landforms were not conspicuous according to Nagy &quot;et al.&quot; 2019, presumably because wind-driven phenomena overprint the effects of cryoturbation. Mass movements have left traces on the mountain.

=== Lakes ===

Ojos del Salado hosts the highest lake in the world in the form of the crater lake in the summit crater. Fed by permafrost and snowfields, it lies at elevation. It is surrounded by fumaroles and covers an area of . Waters in a creek flowing into this lake reach temperatures of .

There are two lakes at elevation on the northeastern slope, away from the higher lake. Each has an area of and an estimated depth of . Ephemeral lakes occur at elevation, when meltwater from permafrost accumulates in closed depressions. Such ponds may form in depressions at elevation. Some of the lakes may be permanently frozen. Lakes might disappear with climate change owing to the breakdown of permafrost.

=== Surroundings ===

The landscape is dominated by volcanoes, many of Pleistocene or Holocene age, and is the highest volcanic region in the world. Young volcanoes have conical shapes and often feature summit craters. Travellers have called the region a &quot;moonscape&quot;. There are hot springs in the region, such as the Termas Laguna Verde at the shores of Laguna Verde, which are frequented by visitors.

The volcano lies in the middle of an over long east–west trending chain of volcanoes that form a drainage divide and includes the volcanoes Nevado Tres Cruces, Incahuasi and Cerro Blanco. This chain of volcanoes appears to be part of the Ojos del Salado-San Buenaventura tectonic lineament, which corresponds to a geographic (southern boundary of the Puna de Atacama) and tectonic discontinuity in the region. The lineament may be a consequence of the subduction of the Copiapo Ridge at this latitude. An alternative view is that the subducting Copiapo Ridge is actually located north of the lineament; this would be more consistent with the theory that the subduction of such ridges gives rise to gaps in the volcanic chain.

== Ice and glaciers ==
Except for firn and small glaciers in sheltered parts of the mountain, Ojos del Salado lacks substantial ice cover. This is due to the arid climate of the region, which causes the equilibrium line altitude of ice to rise above the top of the mountain and keeps most peaks in the area ice-free. Only farther south at Tronquitos does more extensive glaciation begin. Temporary ice and snow accumulations can be mistaken for glaciers, and glacier areas shown on maps are often actually immobile firn fields. The ice reaches thicknesses of only and areal extents of a few hundred metres. Meltwater feeds streams.

Climbing parties in 1956 reported two glaciers on the northwestern slope, a 1958 report indicated that an ice body at elevation descends into two branches and is followed at lower elevation by another glacier also with two branches—but in neither case with any evidence of movement— and in 2014 there was ice in the summit crater and substantial glaciers on the eastern and southern slopes, which reached elevations below . There have been increases in ice area between 1974 and 1983 but between 1986 and 2000, ice area decreased by 40%. The melting of the ice is expected to produce an increased discharge at first, but eventually ice diminishes to the point that runoff will decline.

Penitentes have been encountered by climbers as early as 1937, in 1949 there were reportedly high penitentes on Ojos del Salado. Penitentes are high ice spires which form when ice sublimates in the intense insolation.

=== Subsurface ice ===

Ice buried beneath sand and encased in moraines is more important than surface ice at Ojos del Salado. It is retreating but the insulating effect of the cover slows the retreat. Cryokarst, erosional gullies and so-called &quot;infilled valleys&quot; have been observed; they most likely form when buried ice and snow melt. The combined effect of erosion by the meltwater and the disappearance of ice volume creates cavities that collapse and form the valleys and pseudokarst landforms. Pseudokarst landforms and dolines are other structures generated by the melting of buried ice.

=== Past glaciation ===

Lateral moraines altered by wind erosion occur north of Ojos del Salado and some lava flows bear traces of glaciation. Research published in 2019 found cirques and U-shaped valleys on Ojos del Salado. However, there is no evidence of Pleistocene glacier advances in the region nor any indication of a Pleistocene snowline, although cirques have been reported from Nevado Tres Cruces and some sources propose the existence of glaciers 19,000 years ago. The monsoon reached farther south during the Pleistocene but did not reach Ojos del Salado, allowing the development of glaciers only at more northern latitudes. Westerly winds did not regularly influence the climate at the volcano, either.

== Geology ==

In South America, there are about 200 volcanoes with evidence of eruptions during the Pleistocene and Holocene along the western coast, where the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench. Volcanic activity is localized in four major volcanic belts, the Northern, Central (CVZ), Southern and Austral Volcanic Zones; these are separated by belts without volcanic activity and form part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Where volcanic activity occurs, the subduction process releases fluids from the downgoing slab which trigger the formation of melts in the mantle that eventually ascend to the surface and give rise to volcanism.

The CVZ spans Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and contains about 1,100 recognized volcanoes, many of which are extremely old and are still recognizable owing to the low erosion rates in the region. Apart from stratovolcanoes, the CVZ includes numerous calderas, isolated lava domes and lava flows, maars and pyroclastic cones. Most of the volcanoes are remote and thus constitute a low hazard. Ojos del Salado is part of the CVZ and constitutes its southern boundary. South of the volcano volcanism ceased during the last six million years and until 32° south, subduction takes place at a shallow angle and volcanism is absent in the &quot;Pampean flat-slab&quot;. The shallow angle may be a consequence of the subduction of submarine topography, such as the Copiapo Ridge at the northern end of the Juan Fernández Ridge at the southern margin of the gap.

=== Local ===

The basement in the region crops out in the Cordillera Claudio Gay area, and consists of sedimentary rocks of Devonian-Carboniferous age. The rocks are intruded by and covered by granites and rhyolites associated with Permian volcanic rocks and the Choiyoi Group. Oligocene to recent volcanic rocks and volcano-sedimentary formations cover this basement. The topography at Ojos del Salado bears evidence of what may have been past magmatic uplift. Seismic tomography has yielded evidence of a low seismic velocity anomaly underneath the volcano that may constitute the pathway through which water emanating from the downgoing slab rises through the mantle and gives rise to melting.

Volcanism in the region commenced 26 million years ago, when the Farallon Plate broke up and subduction speed increased. Initially between 26 and 11 million years ago activity was concentrated in the Maricunga region west of the Ojos del Salado region, where only small-volume volcanism took place and which constituted the back-arc to the Maricunga arc. Between 8–5 million years ago activity declined in the Maricunga region and increased in the Ojos del Salado region, until Maricunga volcanism ceased 4 million years ago. This shift coincided with a gradual flattening of the subduction process since the Miocene and was accompanied by change in crustal and mantle properties that are reflected in the isotope ratios of erupted volcanic rocks. During the Quaternary, volcanism formed the edifices of Cerro Solo, El Fraile, Incahuasi, El Muerto, El Muertito, Falso Azufre, Nevado San Francisco, Nevado Tres Cruces and Ojos del Salado, which together cover over half of the area. Apart from the large volcanoes, many smaller mafic monogenetic volcanoes developed in the area, especially east of Ojos del Salado. Pleistocene volcanism was limited to the Ojos del Salado area, where recent faulting offset volcanic rocks. The large dimensions of Ojos del Salado indicate that magmatism was focused here.

=== Composition ===

Volcanic rocks erupted by Ojos del Salado form a calc-alkaline potassium-rich suite of dacitic rocks, with occasional andesite and rhyodacite. Earlier in the geological history of the region more mafic magmas also erupted. The rocks contain phenocrysts like augite, biotite, hornblende, hypersthene, opaque minerals, plagioclase, pyroxene and quartz. Magma mixing phenomena produced olivine and pyroxene xenocrysts and amphibole reaction rims.

== Eruption history ==

Volcanic activity probably commenced 3.3–1.5 million years ago or during the late Pleistocene. The 3.7±0.2 million years old Las Lozas Andesite may have been a precursor of Ojos del Salado. The oldest rocks of Ojos del Salado are 3.5–3.4 million years old dacites in the lower parts of the volcano. Argentine geological maps define a &quot;Ojos del Salado basal complex&quot;, which consists of a number of Miocene volcanoes that have erupted andesite and dacite, partially in glacial environments.

The volcano developed in two stages, with the more recent one grown on top of the older. A somma volcano structure may have formed during an eruption that generated the pumice deposits on the lower slopes of the volcano, and there are potential air fall deposits north of it. Ojos del Salado may or may not have produced pyroclastic flows; the neighbouring Nevado Tres Cruces 67,000 years ago produced extensive deposits on and around Ojos del Salado and in the valley between the two volcanoes; these were originally interpreted to have originated at Ojos del Salado. A pyroclastic flow erupted by Ojos del Salado descended the Cazadero valley and constitutes the &quot;El Quemado Ignimbrite&quot;. Cerro Solo, whose emplacement was probably accompanied by intense pyroclastic flow activity, and lava domes in the summit region are of Pleistocene age. The long-term growth rate of Ojos del Salado amounts to .

Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 1.53 ± 0.13, 1.2 ± 0.3 million and less than one million years ago for rocks in the northwestern part of Ojos del Salado, 1.08 ± 0.09 million years for flows underlying the summit, 1.08 ± 0.04 million years for the northern flank of Ojos del Salado, 700,000±50,000 for its western flank, 450,000±60,000 for El Muerto, 340,000 ± 190,000 years for the summit rocks, and 230,000±40,000 years for El Fraile. Lava flows and a lava dome on the northern flank have yielded ages of 100,000 ± 17,000 and 35,000 years, respectively. The &quot;El Quemado Ignimbrite&quot; may be either 200,000 or less than 50,000 years old. The youngest dates reported are 30,000 years ago.

=== Holocene and historical activity ===

The volcano produced lava flows during the Holocene, which cover an area of , as well as pumice deposits at Laguna Verde and elongated fractures in the summit region. A rhyodacitic eruption was dated with tephrochronology to have occurred 750 ± 250 CE, and may have deposited tephra over the Bolson de Fiambala and in the Tafí and Villa Vil areas of northwestern Argentina. Many volcanic rocks have a fresh appearance but there is no clear evidence of recent activity.

There are no confirmed historical eruptions and the volcano is presently inactive. In November 1993, observers witnessed ash and steam columns on two separate days but no deformation of the volcano was observed by satellites during this occasion. An ash cloud observed on June 13, 2015, and which led to a warnings about volcanic ash to aircraft turned out to be wind-blown volcanic ash in the Fiambala valley. Seismic activity has been reported.

=== Hazards ===

There is no information on volcanic hazards at Ojos del Salado and volcanic hazards in the Central Volcanic Zone are poorly reconnoitred, but a 2018 presentation at the University of Auckland ranked it 14th of 38 Argentine volcanoes and the Chilean geological agency SERNAGEOMIN 75th out of 92, thus as a very low risk volcano. The latter has published hazard maps for the Chilean part of the volcano. Future eruptions would most likely produce lava domes, lava flows and minor explosive activity, and the presence of ice on the mountain makes it a potential source for lahars. Effects would most likely be limited to the direct surroundings of the volcano, such as highway .

=== Fumarolic activity ===

There are fumaroles that emit sulfurous fumes. Polish climbers in 1937 first observed this activity, below the summit and in the summit crater. Fumarolic activity appears to be linked to a rift structure on the volcano. Climbers in 1957 reported that the fumaroles were noisy and the emissions intense enough that with unfavourable winds they could suffocate people. The fumaroles can be observed from satellites in the form of temperature anomalies which reach above background temperatures, but the steam plumes are poorly visible from the ground except from close distance or during episodes of increased fumarolic activity. Geysers have been reported in the summit region. Hot springs occur at the shores of Laguna Verde which may be part of a hydrothermal circulation system of Ojos del Salado. According to a 2020 publication, the mountain was being evaluated for the generation of geothermal power.

== Climate ==

Detailed climate data do not exist for the area. The Puna de Atacama region has an extreme climate with strong wind, high elevation, a dry climate and high insolation; the area is in or just south of the Arid Diagonal.

Temperatures at lower elevations can exceed but mean annual temperatures only reach . Mean winds at Laguna Verde reach maximum speeds of in winter, on the mountaintops they can exceed and can impede climbing attempts. Winds blow strongest in the afternoon. The winds produce aeolian landforms such as aeolian sediments, dunes, gravel pavements, abraded rocks and megaripples at lower elevations, and redeposit snow.

Precipitation consists mostly of hail and snow. It either amounts to less than per year or reaches per year. Compared to sites farther north, precipitation falls primarily during winter, although snowfall is common in summer. Precipitation probably peaks at where the cloud base lies; above that elevation it decreases to about . Snow cover in the area is sporadic and quickly sublimates, which hinders its measurement; the average snow cover is less than thick.

== Vegetation and fauna ==

Due to the dry climate, the region is a desert with little vegetation occurring above elevation, and none above . However, lichens and mosses have been found at higher elevations and green growths have been reported from the summit region. , there were no reports of plants in the waterbodies on Ojos del Salado. Salt, acid and cold-tolerant bacteria have been recovered from sediments in the lakes on Ojos del Salado, consistent with microorganism samples from similar dry volcanic environments.

A diverse flora and fauna has been described in the lower elevation regions south-southeast of Ojos del Salado. Birds such as ducks, flamingos and geese and mammals such as guanacos and vicuñas occur in the Santa Rosa-Maricunga-Negro Francisco region. Chinchillas and vicuñas live in the valleys south of Ojos del Salado, and have drawn humans to the region. Mice venture to elevations of , and earwigs have been observed at elevation.

== Human history ==

As Ojos del Salado is hidden behind and nested among many peaks of similar elevation, for centuries travellers and mountaineers paid little attention to the mountain. Its remoteness meant that for a long time, both its elevation and exact topography were unclear. The positions and names of the mountains were frequently confused.

The Inca used the Paso San Francisco as a major crossing of the Andes but there is no evidence of them building any structures on Ojos del Salado even though a number of such sites exist in the surrounding region. The Spanish conquistador Diego de Almagro crossed the Andes at Ojos del Salado but did not mention it. Ojos del Salado is likewise absent from the 1861 plans of William Wheelwright for a railway across Paso San Francisco. The explorer Walter Penck crossed the area in 1912/13 and 1913/14 but did not identify the mountain.

=== Ascents and debate on elevation ===

In 1896, 1897 and 1903 the Chile-Argentina boundary commission identified a peak in the area and named it &quot;Ojos del Salado&quot;; according to a myth their &quot;Ojos del Salado&quot; was a much smaller mountain and the actual Ojos del Salado was their &quot;Peak &#x27;e&#x27;&quot;. The Polish climbers and Jan Szczepański from the Second Polish Andean Expedition reached the summit on February 26, 1937 and left a cairn but most of the maps and report they drafted were lost during World War II.

After the Polish expedition, the mountain remained unclimbed until 1955, although expeditions went to its lower slopes and sometimes confused other peaks for Ojos del Salado. In that year an expedition from Tucumán ascended a mountain south of Ojos del Salado, which they mistook for the volcano. They stated that the peak may be higher than Aconcagua, which media reported as if it were proven fact. These measurements set off a debate whether Ojos del Salado was higher than Aconcagua and thus the highest summit of the Western Hemisphere, and drew attention to the mountain. Three separate Chilean, Argentine and Austrian parties went to Ojos del Salado in 1956; the Chilean party measured an elevation of with a barometer, a value that was once again presented as proven by the press despite the unreliability of this technique. The Chilean party also claimed seeing the Argentine pampa and the Pacific Ocean from the summit. In 1957, the official elevation of Ojos del Salado was according to Argentina and according to Chile.

The debate on the elevation and confusion about which mountain was Ojos del Salado and who climbed which peak prompted an expedition by the American Alpine Club in 1956. The expedition was hindered by bad weather conditions and a gust of wind stretching a measurement line may have almost frustrated the goal to determine the summit elevation of Ojos del Salado. The same party later used geodetic methods to establish the elevation of Ojos del Salado as and lower than the high Aconcagua. In 1989, Francesco Santon of the University of Padua in Italy, with Argentine assistance, used GPS-based positioning to determine an elevation of .

== Mountaineering and tourism ==

Ojos del Salado and the surrounding mountains draw fewer mountaineers than Aconcagua, with only several hundred climbers every year. Since the 1990s commercial tours have become important facilitators for ascents, and the number of climbers has increased in the 21st century. Ojos del Salado is one of the Second Seven Summits and Volcanic Seven Summits mountaineering challenges. It is easier to climb than an eight thousander owing to its lower elevation and the absence of rock faces and ice, but the high elevation, cold, dry and windy weather and impassable terrain are common challenges for would-be climbers and only a third of all climbing attempts reach the summit. Would-be mountaineers need to consult weather forecasts and prepare equipment before attempting an ascent. The mountain can be ascended from both the Argentine and the Chilean side, but owing to the better logistics most ascents occur from the Chilean side. The increasing mountaineering activities on Ojos del Salado have raised concerns about environmental impacts.

Ascent from the Chilean side is easier as the first refuge can be reached by car, but the actual climb is easier from the Argentine side. A dirt road departing from the highway to Paso San Francisco heads south to Ojos del Salado, past Refugio Murray to the bivouac Refugio Universidad de Atacama/Jorge Rojas at elevation, from there a path goes to Refugio Tejos at elevation and eventually to the summit of Ojos del Salado through scree-covered slopes and a steep ridge/couloir at the end. Ropes and supports are available. Between 2004 and 2015, a Chilean company held a mountaineering concession for the Chilean side and maintained the infrastructure there; after the end of the concession maintenance resumed in 2018. From Argentina, the path runs from Cazadero Grande (Quemadito hut) along a large creek to its origin at Aguas Calientes at . From there it continues first up dry valleys to Acqua di Vicuna at elevation, to the El Arenal plateau at elevation and eventually along various routes to Ojos del Salado. The mountain is also accessible by vehicle, up to or elevation, through a dirt road built after a helicopter accident in 1994.

West of the volcano lies the Nevado Tres Cruces National Park and in 1991/1994 there were plans to make a national park on the Argentine side as well. , the establishment of a &quot;zone of touristic interest&quot; encompassing Ojos del Salado was under discussion in Chile.

== Other uses ==

Astronomers have surveyed the volcano for the possibility of creating an observatory there. The landforms such as the gullies and crater lakes and their conditions, and climatic conditions around Ojos del Salado have also led researchers to investigate it as a potential analogue to environments on Mars. The volcano is one of several depicted on Chilean passports.

Numerous record-high altitude attempts with vehicles have been carried out at Ojos del Salado, including with cars, electric vehicles, motorcycles and utility vehicles. A modified car was driven to an elevation of in 2015.

<text>The English term Jew is originally derived from the Hebrew term &quot;Yehudi&quot; (), which passed into Greek as &quot;Ioudaios&quot; and into Latin as &quot;Iudaeus&quot;, in turn evolving into the Old French term &quot;giu&quot; after the letter &quot;d&quot; was dropped. A variety of related forms are found in early English from about the year 1000, including &quot;Iudea&quot;, &quot;Gyu&quot;, &quot;Giu&quot;, &quot;Iuu&quot;, &quot;Iuw&quot;, and &quot;Iew&quot;, which eventually developed into the modern English word for the Jewish people.

== Etymology ==

=== &quot;Yehudi&quot; in the Hebrew Bible ===
According to the Book of Genesis, Judah (, &quot;Yehudah&quot;) was the name of the fourth son of the patriarch Jacob. During the Exodus, the name was given to the Tribe of Judah, descended from the patriarch Judah. After the conquest and settlement of the land of Canaan, Judah also referred to the territory allocated to the tribe. After the splitting of the united Kingdom of Israel, the name was used for the southern kingdom of Judah. The kingdom now encompassed the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Simeon, along with some of the cities of the Levites. With the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria), the kingdom of Judah became the sole Jewish state and the term &quot;y&#x27;hudi&quot; () was applied to all Israelites.

The term &quot;Yehudi&quot; () occurs 74 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. The plural, &quot;Yehudim&quot; () first appears in where it refers to a defeat for the Yehudi army or nation, and in , where it refers to the language of the Yehudim (). has the earliest singular usage of the word &quot;Yehudi&quot;. In , the name &quot;Yehudi&quot; () has a generic aspect, in this case referring to a man from the tribe of Benjamin:

:&quot;There was a man a &quot;Yehudi&quot; (Jewish man) in Shushan the capital, whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish, a Benjamite; who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the exile that was exiled with Jeconiah, king of Judah, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had exiled.&quot;

The name appears in the Bible as a verb in which states:

:&quot;Many of the people of the land &quot;became Yehudim&quot; (in the generic sense) (, &quot;mityahadim&quot;) because the fear of the Yehudim fell on them.&quot;

In some places in the Talmud the word &quot;Israel(ite)&quot; refers to somebody who is Jewish but does not necessarily practice Judaism as a religion: &quot;An Israel(ite) even though he has sinned is still an Israel(ite)&quot; (Tractate &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 44a). More commonly the Talmud uses the term &quot;Bnei Yisrael&quot;, i.e. &quot;Children of Israel&quot;, (&quot;Israel&quot; being the name of the third patriarch Jacob, father of the sons that would form the twelve tribes of Israel, which he was given and took after wrestling with an angel, see Genesis 32:28–29) to refer to Jews. According to the Talmud then, there is no distinction between &quot;religious Jews&quot; and &quot;secular Jews.&quot;

In modern Hebrew, the same word is still used to mean both Jews and Judeans (&quot;of Judea&quot;). In Arabic the terms are &quot;yahūdī&quot; (sg.), &quot;al-yahūd&quot; (pl.), and بَنُو اِسرَائِيل &quot;banū isrāʼīl&quot;. The Aramaic term is &quot;&quot;.

=== Development in European languages ===

The Septuagint (reputedly a product of Hellenistic Jewish scholarship) and other Greek documents translated , &quot;Yehudi&quot; and the Aramaic &quot;&quot; using the Koine Greek term &quot;Ioudaios&quot; (; pl. &quot;Ioudaioi&quot;), which had lost the &#x27;h&#x27; sound. The Latin term, following the Greek version, is &quot;Iudaeus&quot;, and from these sources the term passed to other European languages. The Old French &quot;giu&quot;, earlier &quot;juieu&quot;, had elided (dropped) the letter &quot;d&quot; from the Latin &quot;Iudaeus&quot;. The Middle English word &quot;Jew&quot; derives from Old English where the word is attested as early as 1000 in various forms, such as &quot;Iudeas&quot;, &quot;Gyu&quot;, &quot;Giu&quot;, &quot;Iuu&quot;, &quot;Iuw&quot;, &quot;Iew&quot;. The Old English name is derived from Old French. The modern French term is &quot;Juif/Juive&quot; (m/f). 

Most European languages have retained the letter &quot;d&quot; in the word for &quot;Jew&quot;. Etymological equivalents are in use in other languages, e.g. &quot;Jude&quot; in German, &quot;judeu&quot; in Portuguese, &quot;jøde&quot; in Danish and Norwegian, &quot;judío&quot; in Spanish, &quot;jood&quot; in Dutch. In some languages, derivations of the word &quot;Hebrew&quot; are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., &quot;Ebreo&quot; in Italian and Spanish, &quot;Ebri / Ebrani&quot; () in Persian and Еврей &quot;Yevrey&quot; in Russian. (See &quot;List of Jewish ethnonyms&quot; for a full overview.) The German word &quot;Jude&quot; () is cognate with the Yiddish word for &quot;Jew&quot;, &quot;Yid&quot;.

===Jewish dictionary definitions and etymologies===
According to the Klein dictionary by rabbi Ernest Klein, the Hebrew word for Jew, Judean, or Jewish which is &quot;yehudi&quot; in Hebrew orig. meant &#x27;member of the tribe Judah&#x27;, later also &#x27;member of the Kingdom of Judah&#x27;. When after the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E. only the Kingdom of Judah survived, yehudi יֽהוּדִי came to denote &#x27;Jew&#x27;, resp. &#x27;Jewish&#x27;. cp. &#x27;Judaic&#x27;, &#x27;Jew&#x27;, &#x27;Chueta&#x27; and &#x27;Yiddish&#x27;.

According to rabbi Marcus Jastrow&#x27;s dictionary, &quot;yehudi&quot; is defined as &quot;worshipper of one God&quot; and rejecting idolatry.

== Modern use ==

In modern English and other contemporary languages, the term &quot;Israelite&quot; was used to refer to contemporary Jews as well as to Jews of antiquity until the mid-20th-century. Since the foundation of the State of Israel, it has become less common to use &quot;Israelite&quot; of Jews in general. Instead, citizens of the state of Israel, whether Jewish or not, are called &quot;Israeli&quot;, while &quot;Jew&quot; is used as an ethno-religious designation.

=== Perception of offensiveness ===

The word &quot;Jew&quot; has been used often enough in a disparaging manner by antisemites that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was frequently avoided altogether, and the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; was substituted instead (e.g. Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association). The German counterpart &quot;Jude&quot; was extensively used during the Nazi period as a part of its anti-semitic campaign (eventually leading to genocide). The word has become more often used in a neutral fashion, as it underwent a process known as reappropriation. Even today some people are wary of its use, and prefer to use &quot;Jewish&quot;. Indeed, when used as an adjective (e.g. &quot;Jew lawyer&quot;) or verb (e.g. &quot;to Jew-down someone&quot;), the term &quot;Jew&quot; is purely pejorative. According to &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, Fourth Edition (2000):
It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun &quot;Jew&quot;, in phrases such as &quot;Jew lawyer&quot; or &quot;Jew ethics&quot;, is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts &quot;Jewish&quot; is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of &quot;Jew&quot; as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as &quot;There are now several Jews on the council&quot;, which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like &quot;Jewish people&quot; or &quot;persons of Jewish background&quot; may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that &quot;Jew&quot; has a negative connotation when used as a noun.

<text>In Fijian mythology, Bulu (pronounced: &quot;Mbúlu&quot;) is a name for the &#x27;world of spirits&#x27; (presumably the underworld). In the month called &quot;Vula-i-Ratumaibulu&quot;, the god Ratumaibulu comes from Bulu, the world of spirits, to make the breadfruit and other fruit trees blossom and yield fruit. Ratumaibulu is a god of great importance who presides over agriculture.

Another source refers to a &quot;place called &#x27;Nabagatai&#x27; on the road to &#x27;Bulu&#x27;, the separate state or land of souls&quot;.

The most westerly point of the island of Vanua Levu was the place from which the departed spirits started out for Bulu, the eternal abode of the blessed (Freese 2005:70).

<doc id="1261987" wikidata="Q2509271" url="?curid=1261987" title="Jewish ethnic divisions">
<text>Jewish ethnic divisions refer to many distinctive communities within the world&#x27;s Jewish population. Although &quot;Jewish&quot; is considered an ethnicity itself, there are distinct ethnic subdivisions among Jews, most of which are primarily the result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, mixing with local communities, and subsequent independent evolutions.

During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora, the communities would develop under the influence of their local environments; political, cultural, natural and demographic. Today, the manifestation of these differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences, liturgical practices, religious interpretations, and degrees and sources of genetic admixture.

==Historical background==
===Ancient Israel and Judah===

The full extent of the cultural, linguistic, religious or other differences among the Israelites in antiquity is unknown. Following the defeat of the Kingdom of Israel in the 720s BCE and the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE, the Jewish people became dispersed throughout much of the Middle East and Africa, especially in Egypt and North Africa to the west, as well as in Yemen to the south, and in Mesopotamia to the east. The Jewish population in ancient Israel was severely reduced by the Jewish–Roman wars and by the later hostile policies of the Christian emperors against non-Christians, but the Jews always retained a presence in the Levant.
Paul Johnson writes of this time: &quot;Wherever towns survived, or urban communities sprang up, Jews would sooner or later establish themselves. The near-destruction of Palestinian Jewry in the second century turned the survivors of Jewish rural communities into marginal town-dwellers. After the Arab conquest in the seventh century, the large Jewish agricultural communities in Babylonia were progressively wrecked by high taxation, so that there too the Jews drifted into towns and became craftsmen, tradesmen, and dealers. Everywhere these urban Jews, the vast majority literate and numerate, managed to settle, unless penal laws or physical violence made it impossible.&quot;
Jewish communities continued to exist in Palestine in relatively small numbers: during the early Byzantine 6th century there were 43 communities; during the Islamic period and the intervening Crusades there were 50 (including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza); and during the early Ottoman 14th century there were 30 (including Haifa, Shechem, Hebron, Ramleh, Jaffa, Gaza, Jerusalem, and Safed). The majority of the Jewish population during the High Middle Ages lived in Iberia (what is now Spain and Portugal) and in the region of Mesopotamia and Persia (what is now Iraq and Iran), the former known as the Sefardim and the latter known as the Mizrahim. A substantial population existed also in central Europe, the so-called Ashkenazim. Following the expulsion of Sephardim from Iberia during the 15th century, a mass migration into the Ottoman Empire swelled the size of many eastern communities including those in Palestine; the town of Safed reached 30,000 Jews by end of the 16th century. The 16th century saw many Ashkenazi Kabbalists drawn to the mystical aura and teachings of the Jewish holy city. Johnson notes that in the Arab-Muslim territories, which included most of Spain, all of North Africa, and the Near East south of Anatolia in the Middle Ages, the Jewish condition was easier as a rule, than it was in Europe.

Over the centuries following the Crusades and Inquisition, Jews from around the world began emigrating in increasing numbers. Upon arrival, these Jews adopted the customs of the Mizrahi and Sephardi communities into which they moved.

===Diaspora===

Following the failure of the second revolt against the Romans and the exile, Jewish communities could be found in nearly every notable center throughout the Roman Empire, as well as scattered communities found in centers beyond the Empire&#x27;s borders in northern Europe, in eastern Europe, in southwestern Asia, and in Africa. Farther to the east along trade routes, Jewish communities could be found throughout Persia and in empires even farther east including in India and China. In the Early Middle Ages of the 6th to 11th centuries, the Radhanites traded along the overland routes between Europe and Asia earlier established by the Romans, dominated trade between the Christian and the Islamic worlds, and used a trade network that covered most areas of Jewish settlement.

In the middle Byzantine period, the khan of Khazaria in the northern Caucasus and his court converted to Judaism, partly in order to maintain neutrality between Christian Byzantium and the Islamic world. This event forms the framework for Yehuda Halevi&#x27;s work &quot;The Kuzari&quot; (c.1140), but how much the traces of Judaism within this group survived the collapse of the Khazar empire is a matter of scholarly debate. Arthur Koestler, in his book &quot;The Thirteenth Tribe&quot; (1976), and more recently Shlomo Sand in his book &quot;The Invention of the Jewish People&quot; (2008) theorized that East-European Jews are more ethnically Khazar than they are Semitic. Genetic studies have not supported this theory.

In western Europe, following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476, and especially after the re-orientation of trade caused by the Moorish conquest of Iberia in the early 8th century, communications between the Jewish communities in northern parts of the former western empire became sporadic. At the same time, rule under Islam, even with dhimmi status, resulted in freer trade and communications within the Muslim world, and the communities in Iberia remained in frequent contact with Jewry in North Africa and the Middle East, but communities further afield, in central and south Asia and central Africa, remained more isolated, and continued to develop their own unique traditions. For the Sephardim in Spain, it resulted in a &quot;Hebrew Golden Age&quot; in the 10th to 12th centuries. The 1492 expulsion from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs however, made the Sephardic Jews hide and disperse to France, Italy, England, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, parts of what is now northwestern Germany, and to other existing communities in Christian Europe, as well as to those within the Ottoman Empire, to the Maghreb in North Africa and smaller numbers to other areas of the Middle East, and eventually to the Americas in the early 17th century.

In northern and Christian Europe during this period, financial competition developed between the authority of the Pope in Rome and nascent states and empires. In western Europe, the conditions for Jewry differed between the communities within the various countries and over time, depending on background conditions. With both pull and push factors operating, Ashkenazi emigration to the Americas would increase in the early 18th century with German-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, and end with a tidal wave between 1880 and the early 20th century with Yiddish-speaking &quot;Ashkenazim&quot;, as conditions in the east deteriorated under the failing Russian Empire. After the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of more than 6 million Jews living in Europe, North America became the place where the majority of Jews live.

==Modern divisions==

Historically, European Jews have been classified as belonging to two major groups: the &quot;Ashkenazim&quot;, or &quot;Germanics&quot; (&quot;Ashkenaz&quot; meaning &quot;Germany&quot; in Medieval Hebrew), denoting their Central European base, and the &quot;Sephardim&quot;, or &quot;Spaniards&quot; (&quot;Sefarad&quot; meaning &quot;Hispania&quot; or &quot;Iberia&quot; in Hebrew), denoting their Spanish and Portuguese base. A third historic term &quot;Mizrahim&quot;, or &quot;Easterners&quot; (&quot;Mizrach&quot; being &quot;east&quot; in Hebrew) has been used to describe other non-European Jewish communities which have bases which are located further to the east, but its usage has changed both over time and relative to the location where it was used. One definition is the Jews who never left the Middle East, in contrast to the Sephardim who went west to Spain, Portugal, and North Africa. A similar three-part distinction in the Jewish community of 16th-century Venice is noted by Johnson as being &quot;divided into three nations, the Penentines from Spain, the Levantines who were Turkish subjects, and the Natione Tedesca or Jews of German origin...&quot; The far more recent meaning of the term, to include both Middle Eastern and North African Jews in a single term, developed within Zionism in the mid-1940s, when Jews from these countries were all combined in one category as the target of an immigration plan. According to some sources, the current sense of the term, as an ethnic group which is distinct from European-born Jews, was invented at this time. The term constitutes a third major layer to some, and following the partition of Mandatory Palestine and Israeli independence, the Mizrahim&#x27;s often-forced migration, led to their establishment of communities in the newly constructed Israel.

The divisions between these major groups are rough and their boundaries are not solid. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities which are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In traditional religious usage and sometimes in modern usage, however, Mizrahim overlap with termed &quot;Sephardi&quot; due to factors including the similar styles of liturgy, despite independent evolutions from Sephardim proper. Thus, among such Mizrahim there are Iranian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, Sudanese Jews, Tunisian Jews, Algerian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Lebanese Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, and various others. Other Asian groups that evolved separately from Sephardim include the Georgian and Mountain Jews from the Caucasus, Indian Jews including the Malabar Yehuddim (Cochin Jews), Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe and Bene Ephraim, the Afghan Jews and Bukharan Jews of Central Asia, and Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews. Yemenite Jews (&quot;Teimanim&quot;) from Yemen and Kurdish Jews are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. Additionally, there is a difference between the pre-existing Middle Eastern and North African Jewish communities as distinct from the descendants of those Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, and in 1497 from the expulsion decreed in Portugal.

Distinct smaller Jewish groups include the Italian rite Jews (i.e. only descendants of ancient Italian Jewish community without later migrants to Italy); the Romaniotes of Greece; various African Jews, including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; as well as various other distinct but now extinct communities.

Despite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, estimated at between 70% and 80% of all Jews worldwide; prior to World War II and the Holocaust however, it was 90%. Ashkenazim developed in Europe, but underwent massive emigration in search of better opportunities and during periods of civil strife and warfare. As a result of this, they became the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents and countries, which previously were without native European or Jewish populations. These include the United States, Mexico, Canada, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, but with Venezuela and Panama being exceptions since Sephardim still compose the majority of the Jewish communities in these two countries. In France, more recent Sephardi Jewish immigrants from North Africa and their descendants now outnumber the pre-existing Ashkenazim.

===Genetic studies===

Despite the evident diversity displayed by the world&#x27;s distinctive Jewish populations, both culturally and physically, genetic studies have demonstrated most of these to be genetically related to one another, having ultimately originated from a common ancient Israelite population that underwent geographic branching and subsequent independent evolutions.

A study published by the National Academy of Sciences stated that &quot;The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora.&quot; Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic uniformity they found among modern Jews, no matter where the diaspora has become dispersed around the world.

Moreover, DNA tests have demonstrated substantially less inter-marriage in most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years than in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and counters theories that many or most of the world&#x27;s Jewish populations were founded by entirely gentile populations that adopted the Jewish faith, as in the notable case of the historic Khazars. Although groups such as the Khazars could have been absorbed into modern Jewish populations – in the Khazars&#x27; case, absorbed into the Ashkenazim – it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazi Jews, and much less that they were the genesis of the Ashkenazim.

Previously, the Israelite origin identified in the world&#x27;s Jewish populations was attributed only to the males who had migrated from the Middle East and then forged the current known communities with &quot;the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism&quot;. Research in Ashkenazi Jews has suggested that, in addition to the male founders, significant female founder ancestry might also derive from the Middle East, with about 40% of the current Ashkenazi population descended matrilineally from just four women, or &quot;founder lineages&quot;, that were &quot;likely from a Hebrew/Levantine mtDNA pool&quot; originating in the Near East in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.

Points in which Jewish groups differ are the source and proportion of genetic contribution from host populations. For example, the Teimanim differ to a certain extent from other Mizrahim, as well as from Ashkenazim in the proportion of sub-Saharan African gene types which have entered their gene pools. Among Yemenite Jews, the average stands at 5–10%, due to the relative genetic isolation of Yemenite Jews this is only a quarter of the frequency of the non-Jewish Yemenite sample, which can reach 35%. In Ashkenazi Jews, the proportion of male indigenous European genetic admixture amounts to around 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, and a total admixture estimate around 12.5%. The only exception to this among Jewish communities is in the Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews); a 1999 genetic study came to the conclusion that &quot;the distinctiveness of the Y-chromosome haplotype distribution of Beta Israel Jews from conventional Jewish populations and their relatively greater similarity in haplotype profile to non-Jewish Ethiopians are consistent with the view that the Beta Israel people descended from ancient inhabitants of Ethiopia who converted to Judaism.&quot; Another 2001 study did, however, find a possible genetic similarity between 11 Ethiopian Jews and 4 Yemenite Jews from the population samples.

DNA analysis further determined that modern Jews of the priesthood tribe—&quot;Cohanim&quot;—share a common ancestor dating back about 3,000 years. This result is consistent for all Jewish populations around the world. The researchers estimated that the most recent common ancestor of modern Cohanim lived between 1000 BCE (roughly the time of the Biblical Exodus) and 586 BCE, when the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple. They found similar results analyzing DNA from Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. The scientists estimated the date of the original priest based on genetic mutations, which indicated that the priest lived roughly 106 generations ago, between 2,650 and 3,180 years ago depending whether one counts a generation as 25 or 30 years.

A study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by Richards et al. (2013) suggested that, though Ashkenazi paternal lineages were of Middle Eastern origin, the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, nor recruited in the Caucasus, but were assimilated within Europe. The study estimated that 80 percent of Ashkenazi maternal ancestry comes from women indigenous to Europe, 8 percent from the Near East, and the remainder undetermined. According to the study these findings &#x27;point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities.&#x27; Some geneticists, such as Doron Behar, a geneticist at Gene by Gene in Houston, US, and Karl Skorecki, at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, are skeptical of these results.

A 2014 study by Fernández et al. found that Ashkenazi Jews display a frequency of haplogroup K in their maternal DNA, suggesting an ancient Near Eastern matrilineal origin, similar to the results of the Behar study in 2006. Fernández noted that this observation clearly contradicts the results of the 2013 study led by Richards that suggested a European source for 3 exclusively Ashkenazi K lineages.

A study by Haber et al. (2013) noted that while previous studies of the Levant, which had focused mainly on diaspora Jewish populations, showed that the &quot;Jews form a distinctive cluster in the Middle East&quot;, these studies did not make clear &quot;whether the factors driving this structure would also involve other groups in the Levant&quot;. The authors found strong evidence that modern Levant populations descend from two major apparent ancestral populations. One set of genetic characteristics which is shared with modern-day Europeans and Central Asians is most prominent in the Levant among &quot;Lebanese, Armenians, Cypriots, Druze and Jews, as well as Turks, Iranians and Caucasian populations&quot;. The second set of inherited genetic characteristics is shared with populations in other parts of the Middle East as well as some African populations. Levant populations in this category today include &quot;Palestinians, Jordanians, Syrians, as well as North Africans, Ethiopians, Saudis, and Bedouins&quot;. Concerning this second component of ancestry, the authors remark that while it correlates with &quot;the pattern of the Islamic expansion&quot;, and that &quot;a pre-Islamic expansion Levant was more genetically similar to Europeans than to Middle Easterners,&quot; they also say that &quot;its presence in Lebanese Christians, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, Cypriots and Armenians might suggest that its spread to the Levant could also represent an earlier event&quot;. The authors also found a strong correlation between religion and apparent ancestry in the Levant: &quot;all Jews (Sephardi and Ashkenazi) cluster in one branch; Druze from Mount Lebanon and Druze from Mount Carmel are depicted on a private branch; and Lebanese Christians form a private branch with the Christian populations of Armenia and Cyprus placing the Lebanese Muslims as an outer group. The predominantly Muslim populations of Syrians, Palestinians and Jordanians cluster on branches with other Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen.&quot;

A 2013 study by Doron M. Behar, Mait Metspalu, Yael Baran, Naama M. Kopelman, Bayazit Yunusbayev et al. using integration of genotypes on newly collected largest data set available to date (1,774 samples from 106 Jewish and non-Jewish populations) for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins from the regions of potential Ashkenazi ancestry:(Europe, the Middle East, and the region historically associated with the Khazar Khaganate) concluded that &quot;This most comprehensive study... does not change and in fact reinforces the conclusions of multiple past studies, including ours and those of other groups (Atzmon and others, 2010; Bauchet and others, 2007; Behar and others, 2010; Campbell and others, 2012; Guha and others, 2012; Haber and others; 2013; Henn and others, 2012; Kopelman and others, 2009; Seldin and others, 2006; Tian and others, 2008). We confirm the notion that the Ashkenazi, North African, and Sephardi Jews share substantial genetic ancestry and that they derive it from Middle Eastern and European populations, with no indication of a detectable Khazar contribution to their genetic origins.&quot;

The authors also reanalyzed the 2012 study of Eran Elhaik, and found that &quot;The provocative assumption that Armenians and Georgians could serve as appropriate proxies for Khazar descendants is problematic for a number of reasons as the evidence for ancestry among Caucasus populations do not reflect Khazar ancestry&quot;. Also, the authors found that &quot;Even if it were allowed that Caucasus affinities could represent Khazar ancestry, the use of the Armenians and Georgians as Khazar proxies is particularly poor, as they represent the southern part of the Caucasus region, while the Khazar Khaganate was centered in the North Caucasus and further to the north. Furthermore, among populations of the Caucasus, Armenians and Georgians are geographically the closest to the Middle East, and are therefore expected a priori to show the greatest genetic similarity to Middle Eastern populations.&quot; Concerning the similarity of South Caucasus populations to Middle Eastern groups which was observed at the level of the whole genome in one recent study (Yunusbayev and others, 2012). The authors found that &quot;Any genetic similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Armenians and Georgians might merely reflect a common shared Middle Eastern ancestry component, actually providing further support to a Middle Eastern origin of Ashkenazi Jews, rather than a hint for a Khazar origin&quot;. The authors claimed &quot;If one accepts the premise that similarity to Armenians and Georgians represents Khazar ancestry for Ashkenazi Jews, then by extension one must also claim that Middle Eastern Jews and many Mediterranean European and Middle Eastern populations are also Khazar descendants. This claim is clearly not valid, as the differences among the various Jewish and non-Jewish populations of Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East predate the period of the Khazars by thousands of years&quot;.

A 2014 study by Carmi et al. published by Nature Communications found that the Ashkenazi Jewish population originates from an approximately even mixture of Middle Eastern and European ancestry. According to the authors, that mixing likely occurred some 600–800 years ago, followed by rapid growth and genetic isolation (rate per generation 16–53%;). The study found that all Ashkenazi Jews descent from around 350 individuals, and that the principal component analysis of common variants in the sequenced AJ samples, confirmed previous observations, namely, the proximity of Ashkenazi Jewish cluster to other Jewish, European and Middle Eastern populations&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==




Because of the independence of local communities, Jewish ethnic divisions, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. It is for this reason that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today.The smaller groups number in the hundreds to tens of thousands, with the Georgian Jews (also known as &quot;Gruzinim&quot; or &quot;Qartveli Ebraeli&quot;) and Beta Israel being most numerous at somewhat over 100,000 each. Many members of these groups have now emigrated from their traditional homelands, largely to Israel. For example, only about 10 percent of the &quot;Gruzinim&quot; remain in Georgia.

A brief description of the extant communities, by the geographic regions with which they are associated, is as follows:

===Europe===
Ashkenazi Jews (plural &quot;Ashkenazim&quot;) are the descendants of Jews who migrated into northern France and Germany around 800–1000, and later into Eastern Europe.

Among the Ashkenazim there are a number of major subgroups:
* Yekkes, or German Jews, stemming from the Lowlands, historical Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. They originally spoke Western Yiddish, which had less Slavic influence than other Yiddish dialects. By the early 20th century, Yiddish was in decline in this population, and assimilation was proceeding rapidly.
* Litvaks, or Lithuanian Jews, emerged as a distinct group in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Latvia and the northeastern Suwałki region of Poland). They have historically spoken the Eastern Yiddish dialect &quot;Litvish&quot; (Lithuanian Yiddish).
* Galitzianers, or Galician Jews, trace their origins to Galicia, Western Ukraine (current Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Ternopil regions) and South-Eastern Poland.
* Jews from central Poland (origins from former Congress Poland), while having fewer specificities and innovations in local cultures than neighboring Litvaks or Galitzianers, nevertheless have had a significant coherent Ashkenazi culture for centuries, and the &quot;Poylish&quot; dialect of Eastern Yiddish.
* Oberlanders, originating in the Oberland region of Hungary and the district surrounding Bratislava in Slovakia, originally spoke Western Yiddish. In modern times before the Holocaust, many Oberlander Jews migrated to urban centers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and adopted German or Hungarian as their first language.
* Unterlanders, who resided in the northeastern region of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia, Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine and Northern Transylvania.)
* According to some sources, Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan can be seen as ethnic group - &quot;dos udmurtishe yidntum&quot;.
* Russian Jews, who have had a presence in Russia and areas connected to it since the times of the Kievan Rus.

Sephardi Jews (plural &quot;Sephardim&quot;) are Jews whose ancestors lived in Iberia prior to 1492.

There are multiple subgroups among the Sephardim:
* Western Sephardim, or the Spanish and Portuguese Jews are a distinct subgroup of Iberian Jews. They are largely descended from Jews who lived as New Christians in the Iberian Peninsula during the immediate generations following the forced expulsion of unconverted Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497.
* Eastern Sephardim are a subgroup of Iberian Jews descended from families exiled from Iberia in the 15th century. Most of them settled in various parts of the Ottoman Empire, while some settled as far as the Malabar coast, importing their culture and customs to the local Cochin Jews.
* North African Sephardim descend from exiled Iberic Jewish families of the late 15th century and North African Maghrebi Jewish communities already settled in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. They have historically spoken Haketia, a Judaeo-Spanish language derived from Old Spanish, Hebrew and Aramaic.
* Belmonte Jews are a Jewish community in Belmonte that lived in Portugal as Crypto-Jews for centuries. They survived in secrecy for hundreds of years by maintaining a tradition of endogamy and hiding all external signs of their faith. 
* Xuetes, or Majorcan Jews, are descendants of Jews who were forcibly converted to Christianity and today live in the Balearic Islands. Some maintained their faith, while others observed a syncretist form of Christian worship known as Xueta Christianity.

Jewish communities in Europe that are neither Ashkenazic nor Sephardic:
*Italkim trace their origins as far back as the 2nd century BCE. It is thought that some families descend from Jews deported from Judaea in 70 CE. They have traditionally spoken a variety of Judeo-Italian languages (Italkian) and used Italian Hebrew as a pronunciation system.
* Romaniotes are a distinct Jewish community that has resided in Greece and neighboring areas for over 2,000 years. They have historically spoken the Judæo-Greek dialect Yevanic, although due to the majority of them being murdered in the Holocaust, combined with assimilation post-WW2 there are no longer any speakers of it.
* San Nicandro Jews – A group of mid-20th century converts from Italy.

===The Caucasus and the Crimea===
* Juhurim, better known as the Mountain Jews, are descendants of Persian Jews from Iran and Babylonian Jews from Baghdad who settled in the eastern and northern Caucasus (modern Azerbaijan, Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia). It&#x27;s believed that they had reached Persia from Ancient Israel as early as the 8th century BCE. The Juhuro survived numerous historical vicissitudes by settling in extremely remote and mountainous areas. They were known to be accomplished warriors and horseback riders. Their language is Judeo-Tat, an ancient Southwest Iranian language which integrates many elements of Ancient Hebrew and Aramaic.
*Gruzim, or the Georgian Jews, are one of the oldest surviving Jewish communities tracing back to the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE. The 2,600-year history of the Georgian Jews was unique in its complete absence of antisemitism prior to Russia&#x27;s annexation of Georgia. They have traditionally spoken Kivruli, a Judaeo-Georgian dialect with a lot of Hebrew and Aramaic loan words. As a result of the Post-Soviet aliyah, the vast majority of Georgian Jews now live in Israel.
* Krymchaks and Crimean Karaites are Turkic-speaking Jews of the Crimea and Eastern Europe. The Krymchaks practice Rabbinic Judaism, while the Karaim practice Karaite Judaism. Whether they are primarily the descendants of Israelite Jews who adopted Turkic language and culture, or the descendants of Turkic converts to Judaism, is still debated, although the question is irrelevant as far as Jewish law is concerned, according to which they are Jews, regardless of whether by Israelite descent or by conversion.
* Subbotniks are a dwindling group of Jews from Azerbaijan and Armenia, whose ancestors were Russian peasants who converted to Judaism for unknown reasons in the 19th century.

===North Africa===
Mostly Sephardi Jews and collectively known as Maghrebi Jews and sometime considered part of the wider Mizrahi group:
* Moroccan Jews migrated to this area after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and settled among the Berbers. They were later met by a second wave of migration from the Iberian peninsula in the period immediately preceding and following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, when the Jews were expelled from kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. Their descendants in the Amazon basin are known as Amazonian Jews, many of whom remain in traditional Jewish communities but others mixed into the local population and developed a separate ethnic identity, often with mixed religious practices.
* Algerian Jews: There is evidence of Jewish settlements in Algeria since at least the late Roman period, followed by Jewish immigrants came to North Africa after fleeing from the persecutions of the Visigothic king Sisebut, and finally the largest segment which were Sephardic Jews forced from Spain due to the Inquisition.
* Libyan Jews stretch back to the 3rd century BCE, when Cyrenaica was under Greek rule. The Jewish population of Libya, a part of the Berber Jewish community, continued to populate the area continuously until the modern times.
* Tunisian Jews: similar to the Libyan Jews
* Berber Jews: Jewish communities of the Atlas Mountains
* Sudanese Jews are Jewish community that lived in Sudan, and was concentrated in the capital Khartoum, they were mainly of Sephardic background, who had constructed a synagogue and a Jewish school.
* Egyptian Jews are generally Jews thought to have descended from the great Jewish communities of Hellenistic Alexandria, mixed with many more recent groups of immigrants. These include Babylonian Jews following the Muslim conquest; Jews from Palestine following the Crusades; Sephardim following the expulsion from Spain; Italian Jews settling for trading reasons in the 18th and 19th centuries; and Jews from Aleppo in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== West Asia ===
Jews originating from West Asia are generally called by the catch-all term Mizrahi Jews, more precise terms for particular groups are:
* Babylonian Jews, also known as Iraqi Jews, are descendants of the Jewish people whom have lived in Mesopotamia since the time of the Assyrian conquest of Samaria.
* Kurdish Jews from Kurdistan, as distinct from the Persian Jews of central and eastern Persia, as well as from the lowland Babylonian Jews of Mesopotamia.
* Persian Jews from Iran (commonly called &quot;Parsim&quot; in Israel, from the Hebrew) have a 2700-year history. One of the oldest Jewish communities of the world, Persian Jews constitute the largest Jewish community in West Asia outside Israel.
* Yemenite Jews (called &quot;Temanim&quot;, from the Hebrew), as well as Adeni Jews are Oriental Jews whose geographic and social isolation from the rest of the Jewish community allowed them to maintain a liturgy and set of practices that are significantly distinct from other Oriental Jewish groups; they themselves comprise three distinctly different groups, though the distinction is one of religious law and liturgy rather than of ethnicity.
* Palestinian Jews are Jewish inhabitants of Palestine throughout certain periods of Middle Eastern history. After the modern State of Israel was born, nearly all native Palestinian Jews became citizens of Israel, and the term &quot;Palestinian Jews&quot; largely fell into disuse.

* Lebanese Jews are the Jews that lived around Beirut. After the Lebanese Civil War, the community&#x27;s emigration appears to have been completed; few remain in Lebanon today.
* Omani Jews are the early Jewish community of Sohar. They are thought to be descendants of Ishaq bin Yahuda, a Sohari merchant around the first millennium. This community is believed to have disappeared by 1900.
* Syrian Jews are generally divided into two groups: those who inhabited Syria from ancient times (according to their own traditions, from the time of King David (1000 BC)), and those who fled to the Ottoman Empire after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492), at the invitation of the Ottoman sultan. There were large communities in both Aleppo and Damascus for centuries. In the early 20th century, a large percentage of Syrian Jews emigrated to the U.S., South America, and Israel. Today, there are almost no Jews left in Syria. The largest Syrian-Jewish community is located in Brooklyn, New York, and is estimated at 40,000.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===

* Beta Israel or Falashim of Ethiopia, tens of thousands migrated to Israel during Operation Moses (1984), Operation Sheba (1985) and Operation Solomon (1991). There are now over 160,000 Ethiopian Jews in Israel, making up approximately 2% of the total Israeli population.
* Descendants of the Jews of the Bilad el-Sudan (West Africa). Jews whose ancestry was derived from the communities that once existed in the Ghana, Mali, and Songhay Empire. Anusim in and around Mali who descend from Jewish migrations from North Africa, East Africa, and Spain.
* The Lemba people in Malawi which number as many as 40,000. This group claims descent from ancient Israelite tribes that migrated down to southern Africa via southern Arabia. Genetic testing has partially upheld these claims. Genetic testing suggests some males have Middle Eastern Ancestry but could not confirm Jewish ancestry.
* South African Jews make up the largest community of Jews in Africa. Dutch Sephardic Jews were among the first permanent residents of Cape Town when the city was founded by the VOC in 1652. Today, however, most of South Africa&#x27;s Jews are Ashkenazi and, in particular, of Lithuanian descent.
*Communities also existed in São Tomé e Príncipe, descended from Portuguese Jewish youths expelled during the Inquisition.

=== South, East, and Central Asia ===

* Cochin Jews are Indian Jews from Malabar in south-western India, and one of the oldest extant groups in India. Most of them now reside in Israel. The community spoke Judeo-Malayalam language. They also constructed synagogues across the Malabar coast.
* Bene Israel are the Jews of Mumbai or Bombay Jews, most of whom now reside in Israel. The community believes that their ancestors fled Judea during the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes. They spoke Judeo-Marathi language. A number of synagogues in Mumbai are still operating.
* Bukharan Jews are descendants of Iranian and Babylonian Jews who settled in Central Asia. They get their name from the former Central Asian Emirate of Bukhara, which once had a large Jewish population.
* Baghdadi Jews are those Jews who came from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and Arab countries and settled in India in the 18th century. Most of these Jews settled in Calcutta. They spoke Judeo-Urdu language. 
* Bnei Menashe is a community of Jews living in Manipur and Mizoram in north-eastern India, claiming descent from the dispersed Biblical Tribe of Menasseh since 1951.
* Bene Ephraim are Telugu-speaking Jews of Kottareddipalem in Andhra Pradesh, India. They claim to be descendants of the Tribe of Ephraim, one of the Ten Lost Tribes.
* Paradesi Jews are Jews who immigrated to the Indian subcontinent during the 15th and 16th centuries following the expulsion of Jews from Spain. The word &quot;Pardesi&quot; means foreign in Indian languages.
* Desi Jews is the term used to refer to communities of Bene Israel and Cochin Jews that had been integrated into South Asian culture and society. The Desi Jewish communities are some of the oldest in world, with more than 2000 years of continuity in the Indian subcontinent.
* Chinese Jews: most prominent were the Kaifeng Jews, an ancient Jewish community in China, descended from merchants living in China from at least the era of the Tang dynasty. Today functionally extinct, although several hundred descendants have recently begun to explore and reclaim their heritage.
* Goan Jews were Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal who fled to Goa in India after the commencement of the Inquisition in those countries. They were the primary targets of the Goa Inquisition.
* Pakistani Jews: There was a thriving Jewish community in Pakistan particularly around the city of Karachi but also in other urban areas up north such as in Peshawer, Rawalpindi and Lahore. The origins of the Jewish community was mixed with some being Bene Israel, Bukharan Jews and Baghdadi Jews. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Jewish refugees from Iran had also came via Pakistan&#x27;s Balochistan province and reached Karachi until the Iranian government closed down the operation. Most of Pakistan&#x27;s Jewish community has not relocated to Israel and Pakistan&#x27;s Jewish population is believed to number around 700. Also the Jews of Allahdad have residence in this area.
* Bangladeshi Jews areJews of Bangladesh who are reported to have been Baghdadi Jews , Cochin Jews and the Bene Israel. Most of these Jews emigrated by the 1960s. Now, only a few Jewish families live in Bangladesh (practicing Crypto-Judaism) due to government policy towards Israel.
* Afghan Jews: Records of a Jewish population in Afghanistan go back to the 7th century. Before the arrival of Islam in Kabul, Kabul and Gandhara were trading places for Jewish merchants. The Afghan Jewish community has disappeared since the 1950s due to gradual emigration to Israel. Since the Mughal period, there had also been a historiographical tradition of the Afghans themselves being descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel.
* Tamil Thattar Jews in Sri Lanka are Jews who have had a presence on the island nation since at least the 9th century.

===Americas===
Most Jewish communities in the Americas are descendants of Jews who found their way there at different times of modern history. The first Jews to settle in the Americas were of Spanish/Portuguese origin. Today, however, the great majority of recognized Jews on both the North American and South American continents are Ashkenazi, particularly among Jews in the United States. There are also Mizrahim and other diaspora groups represented (as well as mixes of any or all of these) as mentioned above. Some unique communities associated with the Americas include:

* Sephardic Bnei Anusim are the descendants of Sephardi Jewish nominal converts (conversos) to Catholicism who immigrated to the New World escaping the Spanish Inquisition in Spain and Portugal. Following the establishment of the Inquisition in the Iberian colonies, again they hid their ancestry and beliefs. Their numbers are difficult to ascertain as most are at least nominally Catholic, having been converted by force or coercion, or married into the religion. Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin America is in the millions. Most would be of mixed ancestry, although a few claim some communities may have been able to maintain a degree of endogamy (marrying only other Crypto-Jews) throughout the centuries. They may or may not consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others may not even be aware of it. The majority would not be halakhically Jewish, but small numbers of various communities have formally returned to Judaism over the past decade, legitimizing their status as Jews. See also Anusim.
* Amazonian Jews are mainly the descendants of Moroccan Jews who migrated to the Amazon basin in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While many remain in traditional Jewish communities in the region, mostly in the northern Brazilian cities of Belém and Manaus, or as part of larger Jewish communities in other Brazilian cities, others scattered in the region and mixed into the local population.
** Iquitos Jews are mostly the mixed descendants of Moroccan Jewish traders who arrived in the Peruvian city of Iquitos during the rubber boom of the 1880s and the local mestizo or Amerindian population. In the late 20th century they began to explore their Jewish heritage, and as most of them lacked a Jewish matrilineal descent, a formal conversion would be required for them to be recognized as Jews under religious law. After years of study, with the help of Conservative rabbis from Lima, the United States, Argentina and Chile, most of them converted to Judaism and moved to Israel between 2003 and 2014.
* B&#x27;nai Moshe are converts to Judaism originally from Trujillo, Peru. They are also known as &quot;Inca Jews&quot;, a name derived from the fact that they can trace indigenous Amerindian descent, as most are mestizos (persons of both Spanish and Amerindian descent) though none with any known ancestors from other Jewish communities. Again, there is no interaction between Peru&#x27;s small Ashkenazi population and the Inca Jews. At the neglect of the Ashkenazi community, the conversions were conducted under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Most have made aliyah and now live in Israel, while a few hundred more of the same community are awaiting conversions.
* Veracruz Jews are a recently emergent community of Jews in Veracruz, Mexico. Whether they are gentile converts to Judaism or descendants of anusim returning to Judaism is speculative. Most claim they descend from anusim.
* Melungeon Jews

===Israel===

The state of Israel was proclaimed as being a home state for all Jews. Although the state’s founders strived towards this goal, the lived experience of Jews differed greatly. At the time when the establishment of the State of Israel was proclaimed, the majority of the Jews who lived in both the state and the region were Ashkenazi. However, by the 1990s, the majority of Israeli Jews were Mizrahi. As of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi ancestry.
Following the establishment of the state, a flood of Jewish migrants and refugees entered Israel from the Arab world in particular and the Muslim world in general. Most of them were Sephardim and Mizrahim, and they included Jews from the Maghreb, Yemenite Jews, Bukharan Jews, Persian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Kurdish Jews, as well as smaller communities, principally those from Libya, Egypt and Turkey. Many immigrants from these communities coming to Israel were met with harsh living conditions, as the fledgling state&#x27;s did not yet have sufficient financial resources to house the influx of its residents. Thus, many immigrants were temporarily housed in tents until spaces of more adequate living means were developed. An additional challenge for non-Ashkenazi Jews was that of a spoken language. Yiddish was the spoken language within Jewish communities in the eastern portion of the European continent, but groups outside of this—who constituted a minority of the population of Israel—spoke other languages. For example, some Sephardic communities spoke Ladino and many Mizrahi Jews spoke Arabic. Hebrew, which was then a language mostly reserved for religious purposes, was the language that Jewish communities had in common. Hebrew was already spoken conversationally among tradespeople living in the region of Palestine, and its full revival as a spoken language that could be used by all residents of Israel was spearheaded by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda.

More recently, other communities have also arrived, including Ethiopian Jews and Indian Jews. Because of the relative homogeneity of Ashkenazic Jewry, especially in comparison to the diversity of the many smaller Jewish communities, over time in Israel, &quot;all&quot; Jews from Europe came to be called &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; in Israel (even those Jews from Europe who did not have any connection to Germany) while Jews from Africa and Asia have come to be called &quot;Sephardi&quot; (even those Jews from Africa and Asia who did not have any connection to Spain). One reason for this categorization is due to many African and Asian Jewish communities performing the Sephardic prayer ritual, and also abiding by the rulings of the Sephardic rabbinic authorities. As a result, they consider themselves &quot;Sephardim&quot; in the broader sense of the term &quot;Jews of the Spanish rite&quot; because they do not consider themselves &quot;Sephardim&quot; in the narrower sense of the term &quot;Spanish Jews&quot;. Similarly, the term &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; has the broader sense of the term &quot;Jews of the German rite&quot;.

Aspects of these differing experiences among Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi Jewry still linger a half-century later, according to studies which were conducted by the Adva Center, a think tank on social equality, and by other Israeli academic research Every Israeli prime minister has been Ashkenazi, although Sephardim and Mizrahim have attained the 
presidency, generally considered a ceremonial position, and other high positions. The student bodies of Israel&#x27;s universities remain overwhelmingly European in origin, despite the fact that roughly half the country&#x27;s population is non-European. Scattered over areas on the border of the Negev Desert and the Galilee, far from Israel&#x27;s major cities, most of these towns never had the critical mass or ingredients to succeed as places to live, and reports have emerged that document their residents suffering from high unemployment and inadequate schools. Prof. Smadar Lavie, Mizrahi U.S.-Israeli anthropologist, has documented and analyzed the discriminatory treatment Mizrahi single mothers endure from the Ashkenazi-majority Israeli government, suggesting that Israeli bureaucracy is based on a theological notion that inserts the categories of religion, gender, and race into the foundation of citizenship. Lavie connects intra-Jewish racial and gendered dynamics to the 2014 Gaza War in her widely reviewed book, &quot;Wrapped in the Flag of Israel: Mizrahi Single Mothers and Bureaucratic Torture&quot;, and analyzes the racial and gender justice protest movements in the State of Israel from the 2003 Single Mothers’ March to the 2014 New Black Panthers.

Intermarriage between members of all of these regathered Jewish ethnic groups was initially uncommon, partially as a result of the distances which separated each group&#x27;s settlement in Israel, and partially because of cultural and/or racial biases. In recent generations, however, the barriers were lowered by the state-sponsored assimilation of all of the Jewish ethnic groups into a common Sabra (native-born Israeli) identity, a policy which facilitated extensive mixed-marriages.

<text>Zelma Inez Edgell MBE, better known as Zee Edgell (21 October 1940 – 20 December 2020), was a Belizean-born American writer who published four novels. She retired as a full, tenured professor of English at Kent State University.

==Biography==

Zelma Inez Tucker was born on 21 October 1940 in Belize City, British Honduras (now Belize), to Veronica (née Walker) and Clive A. Tucker. After attending St. Catherine Academy in Belize City (the basis for St. Cecilia&#x27;s Academy in her novel &quot;Beka Lamb&quot;), Edgell studied journalism at the school of modern languages at the Polytechnic of Central London (1965) and continued her education at the University of the West Indies (1990). She worked as a journalist, first working for &quot;The Daily Gleaner&quot; in Jamaica in 1959, and later serving as the founding editor of &quot;The Reporter&quot;.

From 1966 to 1968, she taught at St. Catherine Academy in Belize. After serving as editor of &quot;The Reporter&quot;, she returned to teach at St. Catherine for the 1980–81 school year. From 1981 to 1987, she served as the first Director of the Women&#x27;s Bureau in the Government of Belize, and later as the Director of the Department of Women&#x27;s Affairs.

She has also lived for extended periods in such diverse places as Jamaica, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Somalia, working with development organizations and the Peace Corps. She has been director of women&#x27;s affairs for the government of Belize, lecturer at the former University College of Belize (forerunner to the University of Belize) and she was an associate professor in the department of English at Kent State University, Kent, Ohio from 1993 to 2009, where she taught creative writing and literature. Edgell also toured internationally, giving book readings and delivering papers on the history and literature of Belize. She is considered Belize&#x27;s principal contemporary writer.

Edgell was married to American educator Alvin George &quot;Al&quot; Edgell (1924–2020), who had a decades-long career in international development. They raised two children, Holly, a journalist, and Randall, a physician specializing in stroke treatment and prevention.

Edgell contributed extensively to the Belizean Writers Series, published by local publishing house Cubola Productions. She edited and contributed stories to the fifth book in the series, &quot;Memories, Dreams and Nightmares: A Short Story Anthology of Belizean women writers&quot;, published in 2004.

In 2020, Edgell died at her home in St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 80. A remembrance ceremony for Edgell was held at the Government House in Belize City in 2022. Speakers included Francis Fonseca and Edgell&#x27;s daughter, Holly.

==Honours==
Edgell was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list for services to literature and to the community.

In 2009 the University of the West Indies conferred upon her the honorary degree D.Litt. at graduation ceremonies in Cave Hill, Barbados.

==Works==
Edgell&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Beka Lamb&quot;, published in 1982, details the early years of the nationalist movement in British Honduras from the eyes of a teenage girl attending high school in the colony. Published a year after Belize became independent, &quot;Beka Lamb&quot; was the first novel to be published in the new nation and went on to claim the distinction of being Belize&#x27;s first novel to gain an international audience, winning Britain&#x27;s Fawcett Society Book Prize in 1982 (awarded annually to a work of fiction that contributes to an understanding of women&#x27;s position in society today). Extracts from &quot;Beka Lamb&quot; have appeared in such anthologies as &quot;The Arnold Anthology of Post Colonial Literatures in English&quot;, edited by John Thieme (1996), &quot;Daughters of Africa&quot;, edited by Margaret Busby (1992), and &quot;Her True-True Name&quot;, edited by Elizabeth Wilson and Pamela Mordecai (1989).

Her subsequent novel, &quot;In Times Like These&quot; (1991), portrayed the turmoil of nearly independent Belize from the point of view of another female protagonist, this time the adult director of women&#x27;s affairs (a post Edgell once held).

&quot;The Festival of San Joaquin&quot; (1997), her third novel, told the story of a woman accused of murdering her husband, and in her short stories, Edgell skillfully explores the layers of Belize&#x27;s complicated social and racial stratification through the lens of her female protagonists. Edgell said she would eventually like to write about male protagonists as well as her extensive travels across the world. &quot;The Festival of San Joaquin&quot;, was re-issued by Macmillan Caribbean in October 2008.

Edgell&#x27;s fourth novel was published by Heinemann&#x27;s Caribbean Writers Series in January 2007. The events of &quot;Time and the River&quot; unfold during the heyday of slavery in Belize. It focuses on the life of a young slave woman, Leah Lawson, who eventually (through marriage) becomes a slaveowner herself. She even finds herself in the position of owning her own family members. The story is told against the backdrop of the brutal forestry slavery of the time and slave revolts, true historical moments in the history of the country that is now known as Belize. Edgell marked the release of this book in Belize with appearances at the University of Belize, Belmopan, and in Belize City.

<text>In business practice, cash account refers to a business-to-business or business-to-consumer account which is conducted on an immediate payment basis i.e. no credit is offered. It may also refer to an account held with a financial firm, in which a client deposits cash to buy stocks, bonds and other securities.

In accounting practice, &quot;cash account&quot; or &quot;cash book&quot; refers to a daybook (Main entry book) used to record all transactions related to cash, especially cash receipts and payments. Cash account is considered as a special daybook because of its dual accounting impact. Cash account acts as a main entry book as well as a ledger in accounting. The dual impact of cash book occurs due to the presence of two sides (entities): Debit and credit.

Cash account is the combination of cash receipts journal and cash payment journal and hence called as &quot;cash receipts and payment journal&quot;. Receipt and payment voucher are the source documents of cash book. Receipt is an evidence to the cash receipts and payment voucher is an evidence to the cash payments.

<doc id="1262026" wikidata="Q7887140" url="?curid=1262026" title="Unit of action">
<text>In acting, units of action, otherwise known as bits or beats, are sections that a play&#x27;s action can be divided into for the purposes of dramatic exploration in rehearsal. 

The concept was propounded by the Russian actor, director and educator Konstantin Stanislavsky, who initially liked to use the term kusok () an ordinary Russian word that can be translated as bit – as in a bit, or slice, of bread or meat. This was the term Stanislavsky preferred in the original drafts of his books. Stanislavsky also referred to these bits of action as episodes, events and facts.

The term “unit” was introduced in the standard early translations of Stanislavsky&#x27;s writings. Use of beat in the place of bit has become mainstream in American method acting. This historic mistranslation may have helped spawn the common metaphor of the dramatic script as a musical score. Stanislavsky used the same metaphor to refer to detailed production plans. It was also taken up by the innovative Polish director Jerzy Grotowski as a score of physical actions.

==Bits of pieces==
Stanislavsky conceived the segmentation of script as a preparatory tool for actors working on a play. Although he used the Russian word for &quot;bit&quot; (&quot;kusok&quot;) in the drafts he originally made for his planned books, he later preferred to speak in terms of &quot;episode&quot; (&quot;epizod&quot; in Russian), &quot;event&quot; (&quot;sobytie&quot;), and &quot;fact&quot; (&quot;fakt&quot;). These were the terms that Stanislavsky chose to use while teaching his system of acting to students at the Opera-Dramatic Studio in Moscow in the final years of his life, when he was concerned about the risk of losing sight of the play as a whole after breaking the action down into small bits. By this time, he was consistently distinguishing between more extended &quot;episodes&quot; (large bits or &quot;events&quot;) and shorter &quot;facts&quot; (medium or small bits or &quot;events&quot;), using the Russian terms he had already employed in his notes and drafts earlier in his career. In Stanislavsky&#x27;s conception, division into &quot;episodes&quot; can reveal the basic building-blocks of action, while subdivision into &quot;facts&quot; can help uncover the changes that occur from one moment to the next. Such divisions can be used to help players explore their characters and discover their actions through improvisation work during the early stages of rehearsal.

The frequently used term &quot;units&quot; derives from the somewhat less intuitive terminology introduced by Stanislavsky&#x27;s original American translator, Elizabeth Hapgood (a fluent speaker of Russian who had married the diplomat Norman Hapgood). In addition to choosing more abstract terms for her translations, Hapgood was somewhat inconsistent in their use. For example, she sometimes confuses &quot;bits&quot; (i.e. &quot;units&quot;) with the related &quot;tasks&quot; that actors must confront in their roles (&quot;objective&quot; is her translation of &quot;zadacha&quot;, the Russian for task).

The term &quot;beats&quot; is commonly used in American method acting. The transformation of &quot;bits&quot; into &quot;beats&quot; may derive from the pronunciation of émigré Russian teachers in America, possibly in conjunction with the image of a string of &quot;beads&quot; on a necklace. 
It has been suggested that oral teachings by Richard Boleslavsky of the Moscow Art Theater, who helped bring Stanislavsky&#x27;s system to America, may have triggered the persistent mistranslation, and ultimately the metaphor commonly encountered in method acting of the script as a musical score. (Following the 1898 Moscow Art Theatre production of &quot;The Seagull&quot;, Stanislavsky had himself referred to the detailed production plan that can be made for a play as the directorial score, and later the metaphor was further developed by Jerzy Grotowski, who envisaged a physical score of action.) The word &quot;beat&quot; is sometimes also employed as a stage direction to indicate a significant pause.

<doc id="1262027" wikidata="Q1940419" url="?curid=1262027" title="Whanganui River">
<text>The Whanganui River is a major river in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the country&#x27;s third-longest river, and has special status owing to its importance to the region&#x27;s Māori people. In March 2017 it became the world&#x27;s second natural resource (after Te Urewera) to be given its own legal identity, with the rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person. The Whanganui Treaty settlement brought the longest-running litigation in New Zealand history to an end.

==Geography==
With a length of , the Whanganui is the country&#x27;s third-longest river. Much of the land to either side of the upper reaches is part of the Whanganui National Park, though the river itself is not part of the park.

The river rises on the northern slopes of Mount Tongariro, one of the three active volcanoes of the central plateau, close to Lake Rotoaira. It flows to the north-west before turning south-west at Taumarunui. From here it runs through the rough, bush-clad hill country of the King Country before turning south-east and flowing past the small settlements of Pipiriki and Jerusalem, before reaching the coast at the city of Whanganui. It is one of the country&#x27;s longest navigable rivers.

The river valley changed in the 1843 Wanganui earthquake.

In 1975, a minor eruption from Mount Ruapehu spilled some of the contents from the Ruapehu Crater Lake (the same root cause of the Tangiwai disaster). This toxic water entered the Whanganui River and had the effect of killing much of the fish life downstream. In the aftermath of the poisoning, eels as large as and trout as large as were washed up dead along the banks of the river. The tributary Whakapapa River had fish losses due to a lahar from Ruapehu in April 1975. Possibly this had effects downstream.

===Tributaries===
==History==
Māori legend explains the formation of the river in the Mount Taranaki legend. When Mount Taranaki left the central plateau for the coast, the land was split open, and the river filled the rift.

Another Māori legend explains that after Māui caught the giant fish that was to become the North Island of New Zealand, known as &quot;Te Ika-a-Māui,&quot; he prayed to Ranginui who then sent two tear drops to land on Māui&#x27;s fish. These two tear drops then became the rivers Whanganui and Waikato.

According to Māori tradition, the river was first explored by Tamatea, one of the leaders of the original migration to the new land, who travelled up the river and on to Lake Taupō. Many places along the river are named in his honour.

The Whanganui River was an important communication route to the central North Island, both for Māori and for settlers, despite many stretches of white water and over 200 rapids. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area around the Whanganui was densely inhabited and with the arrival of the colonial settlers, the area near the river&#x27;s mouth became a major trading post.

Although it was already a significant route to the interior, the major development of the river as a trade route was by Alexander Hatrick, who started the first regular steam-boat service in 1892. The service eventually ran to Taumarunui where rail and coach services connected with points north. One of Hatrick&#x27;s original boats, paddle-steamer PS &quot;Waimarie&quot;, has been restored and runs scheduled sailings in Whanganui. Another of the Hatrick boats, MV &quot;Wairua&quot;, has also been restored and can be seen on the river.

During the early 20th century, the Wanganui River, as it was then called, was one of the country&#x27;s top tourist attractions, its rugged beauty and the Māori kāinga (villages) that dotted the banks attracting thousands of tourists a year.

With the completion of the North Island Main Trunk railway, the need for the steamboat route to the north greatly diminished, and the main economic activity of the river area became forestry. During the 1930s, attempts were made to open the river valley up as farmland, but they were not successful. One legacy of that time is the Bridge to Nowhere, built to provide access to settlements long since abandoned.

In 1912–13 the French filmmaker Gaston Méliès shot a (now lost) documentary film &quot;The River Wanganui&quot; about the river, calling it &quot;the Rhine of New Zealand&quot;.

The settlement of Jerusalem is of particular note. Jerusalem was home to two famous New Zealanders, Mother Mary Joseph Aubert, whose Catholic mission is still located at Jerusalem, and New Zealand poet James K. Baxter, who established a commune at the settlement in 1970.

Other settlements are Tieke Kāinga, Pipiriki, Rānana, Matahiwi, and Koriniti.

===Taonga and Māori land claims===
The river is of special and spiritual importance for Māori, who also refer to it as &quot;Te awa tupua&quot;. It was the home for a large proportion of Māori villages in pre-European times. As such, it is regarded as taonga, a special treasure. Local iwi first petitioned Parliament in the 1870s, and efforts have since been made to safeguard the river and give it the respect it deserves.

For the same reason, the river has been one of the most fiercely contested regions of the country in claims before the Waitangi Tribunal for the return of tribal lands. The Whanganui River claim is heralded as the longest-running legal case in New Zealand history with petitions and court action in the 1930s, Waitangi Tribunal hearings in the 1990s, the ongoing Tieke Marae land occupation since 1993, and the highly publicised Moutoa Gardens occupation in 1995.

On 30 August 2012 agreement was reached that entitled the Whanganui River to a legal identity, a first in the world, and on 15 March 2017 the relevant settlement was passed into law (Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017) by the New Zealand Parliament. Chris Finlayson, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, said the river would have an identity &quot;with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person&quot;. He said some people would consider it strange, but it is &quot;no stranger than family trusts, or companies, or incorporated societies.&quot; The bill finalised 140-year-old negotiations between Māori and the government. The river will be represented by two officials, one from Māori and the other from the government.

===Naming===
&quot;Whanganui&quot; is a phrase meaning &quot;big bay&quot; or &quot;big harbour&quot;. Some very early maps show that European settlers called the river the &quot;Knowsley River&quot;, however it was known as the &quot;Wanganui River&quot; until its name was officially changed to &quot;Whanganui&quot; in 1991, respecting the wishes of local iwi. Part of the reason for this change was also to avoid confusion with the Wanganui River in the South Island. The city at the river&#x27;s mouth was called Wanganui until December 2009, when the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable, Crown agencies would use the &quot;Whanganui&quot; spelling.

See Controversy over Wanganui/Whanganui spelling

==Fauna and flora==

Native fish species in the river include Cran&#x27;s bully, upland bully, climbing galaxias (kōaro), longfin and short-finned eels, pouched lamprey, shortjaw kokopu, torrentfish, New Zealand smelt and black flounder. Introduced brown and rainbow trout are found, although not in high numbers, and there have been reports of catfish.

Other native aquatic species include koura and declining numbers of New Zealand freshwater mussels. The river and its tributaries are home to a variety of invertebrates such as mayflies, stoneflies and caddis flies.

Blue duck (whio) populations can be found at the junction of the Whanganui River and the Mangatepopo and Okupata streams. The Nankeen night heron established roosts along the Whanganui River in the 1990s and is breeding in New Zealand only in this location.

Much of the flora in the river basin can be characterised as a broadleaf and podocarp forest; understory species include crown fern (&quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;), and a variety of other ferns and shrubs.

==River boats==
In 1892 Alexander Hatrick was contracted by Thomas Cook &amp; Son to carry tourists to Pipiriki on the paddle-steamer &quot;PS Waimarie&quot;, the journey was &quot;The Rhine of Maoriland&quot; tourist route into the interior of New Zealand. The river boat subsequently carried mail, passengers and cargo.

&quot;PS Waimarie&quot; operates on the lower stretches of the river, including dinner cruises to Avoca Hotel at Upokongaro and trips to Hipango Park for overnight camping.

On 18 June 2010 the &quot;Adventurer 2&quot; river boat embarked, attempting to make the voyage to Taumarunui. The first voyage to Taumarunui in 82 years. The &quot;Adventurer 2&quot; now offers this trip to tourist as an historic alternative to jet boating and canoeing the river. Though in low water flows it cannot make it all the way to Taumarunui.

=== River boat landings ===

The Whanganui River was the supply artery for the early communities along its banks. River boats used to ply the river, and also into the Ohura River and Ongarue Rivers unless these routes were log jammed after floods.

Between 1891 and 1958 the Alexander Hatrick Riverboat service operated on the Whanganui River. The paddle-steamer Wairere ordered from London and shipped in sections then assembled in Whanganui in late 1891.

It is said that Taumarunui was the highest reach of the Whanganui River that was navigable by river boat. The river flow was managed by the &quot;Wanganui River Trust Board&quot; which built containing walls to direct and deepen the rivers channels for river traffic. Even so, river boats sometimes found it necessary to winch themselves up the more difficult rapids. The River Trust existed from 1891 to 1940.
==Recreational use==

The flow of the river has been altered with the diversion of water from the headwaters by the Tongariro Power Scheme and into Lake Taupō. This may have been a contributing factor to the demise of the raft race and means river boats can no longer make the entire trip to Taumarunui during the drier months (see below).

==Bridges==
Despite being New Zealand&#x27;s longest navigable river, the Whanganui has few bridges. Only two are located on the stretch between Whanganui and Taumarunui. The complete list of bridges in order from source to sea are:

* State Highway 47 Bridge near Tongariro National Park
* Te Pōrere Redoubts Walk crosses the river just downstream from 
* The Western Diversion of the Tongariro Power Scheme crosses the river.
* A private forestry road near Lake Te Whaiau
* Hohotaka Road near Kakahi
* Taumarunui (x4) (including Victory Bridge)
* New Te Maire Bridge (1954)
* Jerusalem, derelict swing bridge.
*The Mountains to Sea cycle trail (Ngā Ara Tūhono) crosses the river on Ūpokongaro Cycle Bridge, which opened on 2 December 2020. The long bridge and cycle path link to it cost $3.4m.
Whanganui –
* Dublin Street Bridge
* Whanganui City Bridge
* Cobham Bridge – long, 9 spans, designed 1959 by Ministry of Works, constructed 1962, abutments rest on raked prestressed concrete piles.
A bridge over the Whanganui to connect Raetihi to Taranaki was to be constructed in the Mangaparua area (where the Bridge to Nowhere) is located, but this plan was never implemented.

=== Rail bridges ===
The oldest bridges over the river are rail bridges; the Aramoho Rail Bridge of 1876 in Whanganui and the Matapuna Bridge of 1903-1904 near Taumarunui.

<doc id="1262049" wikidata="Q881431" url="?curid=1262049" title="David I. Walsh">
<text>David Ignatius Walsh (November 11, 1872June 11, 1947) was an American politician from Massachusetts. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the state&#x27;s 46th governor before winning election to several terms in the United States Senate, becoming the first Irish Catholic from Massachusetts to fill either office.

Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, Walsh was educated at the College of the Holy Cross, subsequently entering a legal practice in Boston after graduating from the Boston University School of Law. He served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1900 to 1901, establishing a reputation as an anti-imperialist and isolationist. In 1912, he won election as the 43rd lieutenant governor, becoming the state&#x27;s first Democratic lieutenant governor in seventy years. He served as governor from 1914 to 1916 and led a successful effort to call for a state constitutional convention.

Walsh won election to the Senate in 1918, earning a reputation as a supporter of Irish independence and as a strong opponent of the Treaty of Versailles. He lost his re-election bid in 1924 but returned to the Senate two years later. Walsh became increasingly opposed to an activist government, and supported Al Smith over Franklin D. Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Despite his lukewarm support for President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal agenda, he introduced the Walsh-Healey Act that established labor standards for government contractors. Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Walsh opposed American involvement in World War II and was a leading member of the America First Committee. However, in a reversal from his earlier stance on the League of Nations, he voted to ratify the United Nations Charter in 1946.

Walsh lost his 1946 re-election bid to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and died the following year. A maverick in the Senate who regularly broke with his own party, he was remembered chiefly for his isolationism, as well as his passionate defense of Irish and Catholic interests. Walsh, who never married, was also dogged by accusations of homosexuality during his lifetime, including a sensationalized scandal in his final term that he privately called &quot;a tragic Gethsemane&quot; to his political career.

==Early life and education==
Walsh was born in Leominster, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1872, the ninth of ten children. His parents were Irish Catholic immigrants. Walsh attended public schools in his birthplace and later in Clinton, Massachusetts. His father, a comb maker, died when he was twelve. Thereafter, his mother ran a boarding house.

Walsh graduated from Clinton High School in 1890 and from the College of the Holy Cross in 1893. He attended Boston University Law School, where he graduated in 1897. Walsh was admitted to the bar and commenced the practice of law in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, in 1897, later practicing in Boston.

==Career in state politics==
Walsh was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives for two terms in 1900 and 1901, elected from a longtime Republican district. From the start of his political career, he was anti-imperialist and isolationist and opposed America&#x27;s authority over the Philippines as part of the settlement of the Spanish–American War. Walsh&#x27;s vote to restrict the hours that women and children could work to 58 led to his defeat when he sought another term. He next lost the race for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts in 1910, but ran again and won in 1912, becoming the state&#x27;s first Democratic lieutenant governor in 70 years. He became the first Irish and the first Catholic Governor of Massachusetts in 1914, successfully challenging the incumbent Democratic governor Eugene Foss for the party nomination, and then defeating a divided Republican opposition (and Foss, who ran as an independent) with a comfortable plurality. He served two one-year terms.

He offered voters an alternative to boss-dominated politics, expressing a &quot;forthright espousal of government responsibility for social welfare&quot;. Walsh proposed increased government responsibility for charity work and the care of the insane and reorganized the state&#x27;s management of these areas with little opposition. In his 1914 campaign for re-election, he cited as accomplishments an increase in the amounts paid for workman&#x27;s compensation and improved administration of the state&#x27;s care for the insane. As governor, Walsh fought unsuccessfully for a Women&#x27;s Suffrage Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. He also campaigned for film censorship in the state after large protests were mounted against the racial depictions in D. W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. Several progressive labor laws were also introduced during his time as governor.

He supported the work of the Anti-Death Penalty League, a Massachusetts organization founded in 1897 that was particularly active and nearly successful in the decade preceding World War I.

As governor he asked the legislature to call a Constitutional Convention without success. When the legislature later called a convention, Walsh won election as a delegate-at-large as part of a slate of candidates who endorsed adding provisions for initiative and referendum to the state constitution, key Progressive-era reforms. He served as a delegate-at-large to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention in 1917 and 1918 that saw those reforms passed. His speech on behalf of initiative and referendum shows him in the role of populist and reformer:

In 1914, Walsh was challenged for the governorship by Samuel W. McCall, a moderate Republican. He narrowly won reelection, probably due to the presence of a Progressive (Bull Moose) candidate who took votes from McCall. McCall successfully reunited the Republicans and the Progressives the next year, and defeated Walsh, in part by supporting Walsh&#x27;s call for a constitutional convention.

Walsh returned to the practice of law after leaving office, working with his older brother Thomas in his hometown of Clinton.

==Career in national politics==
In 1918, Walsh was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving his first term from March 4, 1919, to March 3, 1925. He was the first Irish Catholic senator from Massachusetts, and second Massachusetts senator to be elected by popular vote, after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A noted orator, he introduced Irish Republic President Éamon de Valera at Fenway Park on June 29, 1919.

Walsh broke with Democratic President Woodrow Wilson on the subject of the Treaty of Versailles, joining fellow Massachusetts senator (and Republican) Henry Cabot Lodge in opposition. His initial objections stemmed from the fact that the proposed League of Nations would &quot;make secure and assured the rights of every single nation in the world except Ireland.&quot; In general, he felt that the Treaty failed to adequately provide for the right to self-determination, which had been articulated in Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points. Walsh also became a vocal critic of Article 10, which would have allowed the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the US Congress. Consequently he was labeled one of the &quot;Irreconcilables&quot;, a bloc of 12–18 mostly Republican senators who refused to pass the treaty even with the &quot;reservations&quot; proposed by Lodge.

At the Democratic National Convention in 1924, he spoke in favor of condemning the Ku Klux Klan by name in the party platform: &quot;We ask you to cut out of the body politic with the sharpest instrument at your command this malignant growth which, injected, means the destruction of everything which has made America immortal. If you can denounce Republicanism, you can denounce Ku Kluxism. If you can denounce Bolshevism, you can denounce Ku Kluxism.&quot; Walsh was one of nine Senators to oppose the Immigration Act of 1924.

Walsh failed to win reelection by just 20,000 votes in 1924, the year of the Coolidge landslide, and briefly resumed the practice of law in Boston. Following the death of Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republicans fought hard to retain his seat. Though Herbert Hoover and Charles Evans Hughes campaigned for his opponent, in the November 1926 special election Walsh won the right to complete the remaining two years of Lodge&#x27;s term, defeating William Morgan Butler, a friend of Coolidge and head of the Republican National Committee.

Walsh&#x27;s 1924 defeat also marked a turning point in his political philosophy. He had previously endorsed an activist role for government, but after 1924 his rhetoric increasingly attacked the &quot;federal bureaucracy&quot; and &quot;big government&quot;. Though he had once advocated in favor of federal child labor legislation, he became one of its most consistent opponents.

In 1929, &quot;Time&quot; published a detailed profile of Walsh and his voting record. It noted that he voted for the Jones Act of 1929 that increased penalties for the violation of Prohibition, but said the Senator &quot;votes Wet, drinks Wet&quot;. Its more personal description said:

A bachelor, he is tall and stout. A double chin tends to get out over his tight-fitting collar. His stomach bulges over his belt. He weighs 200 lbs. or more. Setting-up exercises every other day at a Washington health centre have failed to reduce his girth. He is troubled about it. His dress is dandified. He wears silk shirts in bright colors and stripes and, often, stiff collars to match. His feet are small and well-shod. Beneath his habitual derby hat his hair is turning thin and grey. Society is his prime diversion. Of secondary interest are motoring, sporting events, the theatre. In Washington he occupies an expensive suite of rooms at the luxurious Carlton Hotel on 16th Street. A good and frequent host himself, he accepts all invitations out, is one of the most lionized Senators in Washington.
&quot;Time&quot; reported that some commented on the contrast between his political populism and his luxurious life style. The profile noted he was a &quot;gruff and bull-voiced debater&quot; but that &quot;in private conversation his voice is soft and controlled.&quot; In sum, &quot;Time&quot; said that &quot;Impartial Senate observers rate him thus: A good practical politician, a legislator above the average. His political philosophy is liberal and humane, except on economic matters (the tariff) which affect the New England industry, when he turns conservative. His floor attendance is regular, his powers of persuasion, fair.&quot;

When attacking the Hoover administration following the 1930 elections, Walsh identified two principal causes of voter dissatisfaction: &quot;the administration&#x27;s indifference to economic conditions and its failure to recognize the widespread opposition to prohibition&quot;.

Walsh won reelection in 1928, 1934 and 1940, failing in his final bid for reelection in 1946. During his Senate service, Walsh held the posts of chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor (73rd and 74th Congresses) and of the Committee on Naval Affairs (74th-77th and 79th Congresses). In 1932, he supported Al Smith against FDR for the Democratic nomination for president. He objected to Justice Hugo Black&#x27;s failure to disclose his earlier membership in the Ku Klux Klan and promoted the appointment of Jews to the judiciary, notably that of Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, a longtime friend. Though a Democrat, he gave only reluctant support to President Roosevelt&#x27;s agenda. In 1936, when some Democrats looked for an alternative presidential candidate, he supported Roosevelt, &quot;although their relations are none too good&quot;. A newspaper reported that &quot;He is not of the insurgent type ... At heart, observers [in Boston] say, he dissents from many of the policies of the New Deal&quot;, but &quot;he will stay on the reservation&quot; and &quot;he will avoid an open break&quot;. During the campaign, he failed to speak in support of the President until October 20, 1936.

In 1936, Walsh, as head of the Senate Labor Committee, lent his name an administration bill to establish labor standards for employees of government contractors, known as the Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act It provided for minimum wages and overtime, safety and sanitation rules, and restrictions on the use of child and convict labor.

In 1937, he declared himself an opponent of the administration and joined the opposition to FDR&#x27;s plan to enlarge the Supreme Court. Speaking at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall, Walsh argued his position in terms of the separation of powers, judicial independence, and the proper role of the executive. He described the public&#x27;s reaction as &quot;a state of fear, of apprehension, of bewilderment, of real grief, as a result of the proposal to impair, if not indeed to destroy, the judicial independence of the Supreme Court&quot;. He also emphasized the role of the Court in protecting civil liberties, citing two examples:

He continued:

One Cabinet official described his overall relationship to the administration as &quot;not sympathetic ... to put it mildly&quot;.

Along with four of his colleagues, Walsh condemned antisemitism in Nazi Germany in a Senate speech on June 10, 1933.

===World War II===
Immediately following the defeat of France, Walsh was the sponsor, along with Representative Vinson, of the Vinson–Walsh Act of July 1940 that increased the size of the U.S. Navy by 70 percent. It included seven battleships, 18 aircraft carriers and 15,000 aircraft.

In the Senate, Walsh was a consistent isolationist He supported American neutrality with respect to the Spanish Civil War and opposed an American alliance with the United Kingdom until the attack on Pearl Harbor. Speaking in the Senate on June 21, 1940, he denounced Roosevelt&#x27;s plans to provide armaments to Great Britain:

At the 1940 Democratic National Convention, where Walsh supported James Farley for president rather than FDR, he and his fellow isolationist Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana proposed a plank for the party platform that read: &quot;We will not participate in foreign wars and we will not send our army or navy or air force to fight in foreign lands outside of the Americas.&quot; When the President added the words &quot;except in case of attack&quot;, they accepted the change. In that year&#x27;s election, he out-polled Roosevelt in Massachusetts despite being opposed by the CIO for his anti-New Deal positions.

After the 1940 election in particular, he opposed any action that would compromise American neutrality, first in closed-door hearings of the Naval Affairs Committee, which he headed, and then in attacking the Lend-Lease program on the floor of the Senate. He was a leading member of the America First movement, opposing U.S. involvement in World War II. In 1940, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Walsh as a &quot;more moderate critic&quot; of the administration&#x27;s attempts to aid Great Britain even as he called the August commitment FDR made to Churchill one &quot;that goes far beyond the Constitutional powers of the President and one that no other President in our history even presumed to assume. ... The President alone, and on his own initiative, has undertaken to pledge our government, our nation, and the lives of 130,000,000 persons and their descendants for generations to come.&quot;

When the Senate considered the Burke–Wadsworth Act to establish peacetime conscription for the first time in U.S. history, Walsh offered an amendment, which failed to pass, that would have delayed the law&#x27;s effective date until war was declared. In June 1940, he authored an amendment to the naval appropriations bill, sometimes called the Walsh Act of 1940, which permitted &quot;surplus military equipment&quot; to be sold only if it was certified as useless for American defense. To aid Great Britain, the administration evaded the Walsh provision by substituting leases for sales and by trading equipment for bases. In 1941, when the administration used the Greer incident, an exchange of fire between a German submarine and an American destroyer, to authorize American forces to &quot;shoot on sight&quot;, Walsh held hearings of the Naval Affairs Committee to demonstrate that the administration was misrepresenting the facts of the encounter to support its case for American military action against Germany. Walsh also was an outspoken fan of the periodical &quot;Social Justice&quot;, published by Father Coughlin.

===&quot;House of Degradation&quot; scandal===
On May 7, 1942, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, which had long favored U.S. involvement in the European conflict, implicated Walsh in a sensational sex and spy scandal uncovered at a Brooklyn male brothel for U.S. Navy personnel that had been infiltrated by Nazi spies. The charges went unreported by the rest of the press, but word of mouth made it, according to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;one of the worst scandals that ever affected a member of the Senate.&quot; The police operation led to the arrest and conviction of three foreign agents and the brothel&#x27;s owner-operator, Gustave Beekman, though promised leniency for cooperating with the police, received the maximum sentence of 20 years for sodomy and was not released from prison until 1963.

The scandal was complex in that it implicated the Senator as a homosexual, as a patron of a male bordello, and as a possible dupe of enemy agents. Homosexuality was a taboo subject for public discourse, so the &quot;Post&quot; referred to a &quot;house of degradation&quot;. At one point a sub-headline in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;Resort&quot;. In the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, columnist Walter Winchell mentioned &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s spy nest, also known as the swastika swishery.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; first suggested a scandal. Over the course of several weeks it hinted an important person was involved, then named &quot;Senator X&quot;, and finally identified Walsh by name. Its sensational treatment of the story detracted from the seriousness of its charges. The Post was not alone in its coyness; before Walsh was named, Winchell teased that the mystery man was &quot;one of four Senators with the same last initial...the 23rd letter of the alphabet.&quot;

The brothel&#x27;s owner and several others arrested in a police raid identified Walsh to the police as &quot;Doc&quot;, a regular client, whose visits ended just before police surveillance began. Some furnished intimate physical details. President Roosevelt believed the charge that Walsh was homosexual was true. He told Vice President Henry Wallace that &quot;everyone knew&quot; about Walsh&#x27;s homosexuality and he had a similar conversation with Alben W. Barkley, the Senate majority leader.

Without discussing details, Walsh issued a brief statement calling the story &quot;a diabolical lie&quot; and demanding a full investigation. He then conducted his usual Senate business without reference to the charges. An FBI investigation produced no evidence to support the &quot;New York Post&quot; specific charges against the Senator, though it accumulated much &quot;derogatory information&quot; in its files.

On May 20, 1942, with a full report from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in hand, Senator Barkley addressed the Senate at length on the irresponsibility of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the laudable restraint of the rest of the press, the details of the FBI&#x27;s report, and the Senate&#x27;s affirmation of Walsh&#x27;s &quot;unsullied&quot; reputation. He declined to insert the FBI report in the Congressional Record, he said, &quot;because it contains disgusting and unprintable things&quot;. Without addressing Walsh&#x27;s sexuality, he said the report contained no evidence that Walsh ever &quot;visited a &#x27;house of degradation&#x27; to connive or to consort with, or to converse with, or to conspire with anyone who is the enemy of the United States&quot;. He denied the charges related to espionage. He provided no specifics about the sexual activity at issue and said the details of the charges were &quot;too loathsome to mention in the Senate or in any group of ladies and gentlemen&quot;. The press conflated the charges in a similar way. For example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; report of Barkley&#x27;s speech said that the FBI reported that &quot;there is not the &#x27;slightest foundation&#x27; for charges that Senator Walsh, 69-year-old chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, visited a &#x27;house of degradation&#x27; in Brooklyn and was seen talking to Nazi agents there.&quot;

Isolationist senators promptly denounced the charges as an attack on their political position. Senator Bennett Clark asserted that Morris Ernst, attorney for the &quot;New York Post&quot;, had contacted the White House trying to engage the administration to smear FDR&#x27;s opposition. Senator Gerald Nye contended the incident represented a larger effort on the part of a &quot;secret society&quot; that for two years had been trying to discredit him and his fellow isolationists.

The press used these Senate speeches to cover the affair at last. Their treatment varied in tone:
*&quot;The Boston Globe&quot;: Senator Walsh Story Denounced as Absolute Fabrication
*&quot;The New York Times&quot;: FBI Clears Walsh, Barkley Asserts
*&quot;New York Post&quot;: Whitewash for Walsh

&quot;Time&quot; reported Barkley&#x27;s speech exonerating Walsh and that the &quot;Post&quot; in reply had repeated its charges. It concluded its coverage: &quot;The known facts made only one thing indisputable: either a serious scandal was being hushed up or a really diabolical libel had been perpetrated.&quot; 
In private, the New York Post&#x27;s publisher became concerned about the newspaper&#x27;s libel exposure and hired a team led by Daniel Doran to conduct an investigation into Walsh&#x27;s behavior and the Post&#x27;s own reporting. Doran learned that Walsh had been in attendance at the Senate in Washington at the same times he was alleged to have been visiting the gay brothel. &quot;Not a single item of legal evidence has been obtained,&quot; Doran reported back to the Post, which never amended or corrected its reporting.

===Final Senate years===
During the 1944 presidential race, with FDR seeking a fourth term, his running mate Harry S. Truman referred to Walsh as an &quot;isolationist&quot;, a characterization Walsh resented. On November 2, just five days before the election, the President called Walsh at his home in Clinton, Massachusetts, and invited him to join the presidential party in Worcester, Massachusetts. Walsh accepted the invitation to the relief of the Democrats. The contretemps gave Walsh an opportunity to define his position, that he was no isolationist because he favored the war and seeing the war through to total victory. He also believed the troops should return home quickly, allowing only that some may be required to perform &quot;police duties in enemy territory&quot;, and the reserves demobilized. He hoped for a &quot;democratic peace ... free from the influences of political expediency which compromises with imperialism and surrenders to power politics&quot;.

In 1945, demonstrating that his isolationism was not absolute, Walsh voted in favor of the United Nations Charter. He was one of a dozen senators who protested the failure of the United Nations to invite a Jewish delegation to its founding San Francisco Conference.

Given his poor relationship with the White House, Walsh anticipated that the administration might even support an opponent in a Democratic primary when he next ran for reelection. He faced no such challenge, but was defeated in his 1946 race for reelection by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr by a landslide.

==Personal life and death==

Walsh was raised a Roman Catholic and throughout his life identified himself as a Catholic and practiced his religion both in public and in private. An altar boy as a youth, in his adult years he regularly attended retreats and participated in meetings of Catholic laymen. Senate colleagues recognized his Catholic faith and occasionally baited him by challenging him to defend himself as a partisan of Catholic interests, which Walsh did not hesitate to answer. Once when a senator accused the Catholic Church of attempting to involve the United States in the Church&#x27;s battle with the government of Mexico, Walsh defended the Church at length, saying in part:

Walsh never married. He and his brother Thomas, who died in 1931, supported their four unmarried sisters, two of whom outlived the Senator. Some biographers and historians believe Walsh to have been homosexual. Writing in the 1960s, former Attorney General Francis Biddle hinted at the subject when he described Walsh in the mid-1930s as &quot;an elderly politician with a soft tread and low, colorless voice ... whose concealed and controlled anxieties not altogether centered on retaining his job.&quot; According to Gore Vidal, interviewed in 1974, &quot;There wasn&#x27;t anybody in Massachusetts ... who didn&#x27;t know what David Walsh was up to.&quot; Walsh&#x27;s most recent biographer writes that &quot;The campaign to destroy David I. Walsh worked because he could not defend himself ... David I. Walsh was gay.&quot;

He was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.

Upon his retirement from political office, Walsh resided in Clinton, Massachusetts, until his death following a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston on June 11, 1947. Walsh is buried in St. John&#x27;s Cemetery in Clinton.

In his later years he received honorary degrees from Holy Cross, Georgetown University, Notre Dame, Fordham, Boston University, Canisius College, and St. Joseph&#x27;s College (Philadelphia),

A bronze statue of him by Joseph Coletti was erected near the Music Oval on Boston&#x27;s Charles River Esplanade in 1954. It bears the motto: &quot;non sibi sed patriae&quot;, a tribute to his service to the U.S. Navy while in the Senate. Walsh&#x27;s alma mater, Holy Cross, awards an annual scholarship in his name.

<doc id="1262054" wikidata="Q48136" url="?curid=1262054" title="Persecution of Jews">
<text>The persecution of Jews has been a major event in Jewish history prompting shifting waves of refugees and the formation of diaspora communities. As early as 605 BCE, Jews who lived in the Neo-Babylonian Empire were persecuted and deported. Antisemitism was also practiced by the governments of many different empires (Roman Empire) and the adherents of many different religions (Christianity), and it was also widespread in many different regions of the world (Middle East and Islamic).

Jews were commonly used as scapegoats, for tragedies and disasters such as in the Black Death Persecutions, the 1066 Granada massacre, the Massacre of 1391 in Spain, the many Pogroms in the Russian Empire, and the tenets of Nazism prior to and during World War II, which led to The Holocaust and the murder of six million Jews.

==Ancient history==
===Neo-Babylonian Empire===

The Babylonian captivity or the Babylonian exile is the period in Jewish history during which a large number of Judeans from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captives in Babylon, the capital city of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, following their defeat in the Jewish–Babylonian war and the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem. The event is described in the Hebrew Bible, and its historicity is supported by archaeological and non-biblical evidence.

After the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II besieged Jerusalem, which resulted in tribute being paid by the Judean king Jehoiakim. In the fourth year of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s reign, Jehoiakim refused to pay further tribute. This led to another siege of the city in Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s seventh year that culminated in the death of Jehoiakim and the exile to Babylonia of his successor Jeconiah, his court and many others.

Jeconiah&#x27;s successor Zedekiah and others were exiled in Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s 18th year. A later deportation occurred in Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s 23rd year. The dates, numbers of deportations, and numbers of deportees given in the biblical accounts vary. These deportations are dated to 597 BCE for the first, with others dated at 587/586 BCE, and 582/581 BCE respectively.

=== Seleucid Empire ===

When Judea fell under the authority of the Seleucid Empire, the process of Hellenization was enforced by law. This effectively meant requiring pagan religious practice. In 167 BCE Jewish sacrifice was forbidden, sabbaths and feasts were banned and circumcision was outlawed. Altars to Greek gods were set up and animals prohibited to Jews were sacrificed on them. The Olympian Zeus was placed on the altar of the Temple. Possession of Jewish scriptures was made a capital offense.

===Roman Empire===

The Jewish Encyclopaedia refers to the persecution of Jews and the paganization of Jerusalem during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD):
== Medieval period ==
===Europe===

In the Middle Ages, antisemitism in Europe was religious. Many Christians, including members of the clergy, held the Jewish people collectively responsible for the killing of Jesus. As stated in the &quot;Boston College Guide to Passion Plays&quot;, &quot;Over the course of time, Christians began to accept … that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for killing Jesus. According to this interpretation, both the Jews present at Jesus Christ&#x27;s death and the Jewish people collectively and for all time, have committed the sin of deicide, or &#x27;god-killing&#x27;. For 1900 years of Christian-Jewish history, the charge of deicide has led to hatred, violence against and murder of Jews in Europe and America.&quot;

During the High Middle Ages in Europe, there was full-scale persecution of Jews in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and . The persecution reached its first peak during the Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096), flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were utterly destroyed, a prime example being the Rhineland massacres.

In the Second Crusade (1147), Jews in France were subject to frequent massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds&#x27; Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The Crusades were followed by expulsions. All English Jews were banished in 1290. 100,000 Jews were expelled from France in 1396. In 1421, thousands were expelled from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland.

As the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half of the population, Jews were taken as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence in the Black Death persecutions. Although Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by papal bull on July 6, 1348 – with another following later in 1348 – several months afterwards, 900 Jews were burnt alive in Strasbourg, where the plague hadn&#x27;t yet affected the city.

One study finds that persecutions and expulsions of Jews increased with negative economic shocks and climatic variations in Europe during the period from 1100 to 1600. The authors of the study argue that this stems from people blaming Jews for misfortunes and weak rulers going after Jewish wealth in times of fiscal crisis. The authors propose several explanations for why Jewish persecutions significantly declined after 1600:
* 1. there were simply fewer Jewish communities to persecute by the 17th century;
* 2. improved agricultural productivity, or, better-integrated markets may have reduced vulnerability to temperature shocks;
* 3. the rise of stronger states may have led to more robust protection for religious and ethnic minorities;
* 4. there were fewer negative temperature shocks.
* 5. the impact of the Reformation and the Enlightenment may have reduced anti-semitic attitudes.

===Muslim world===


According to Mark R. Cohen, during the rise of Islam, the first encounters between Muslims and Jews resulted in friendship when the people of Medina gave Muhammad refuge, among them were Jewish tribes of Medina. Conflict arose when Muhammad expelled certain Jewish tribes after they refused to swear their allegiance to him and aided Meccan pagans. He adds that this encounter was an exception rather than a rule.

Of the three Jewish tribes of Medina, the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qaynuqa were expelled in the course of Muhammad&#x27;s rule after suspicion arose in the Muslim leadership that the Jews were planning the assassination of Muhammad. On the other hand, the Banu Qurayza tribe was exterminated by Muhammad in the aftermath of the Battle of the Trench. The tribe was accused of colluding with Meccan enemies during the Meccan siege of Medina and subsequently besieged. When they surrendered, all grown men were executed and women and children were enslaved. Muhammad is recorded as saying that he would expel all Jews and Christians from Arabia, although this was not carried out until the reign of Umar.

When Amr ibn al-As conquered Tripoli in 643, he forced the Jewish and Christian Berbers to give their wives and children as slaves to the Arab army as part of their &quot;jizya&quot;.

Traditionally, Jews living in Islamic states were subjected to the status of &quot;dhimmi&quot;, therefore they were allowed to practice their religion and administer their internal affairs, but were subjects to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males) to Muslims. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Contrary to popular belief, the Qur&#x27;an did not order Muslims to force Jews to wear distinctive clothing. Obadiah the Proselyte reported in 1100 AD, that the Caliph had created this rule himself.

Resentment toward Jews perceived as having attained too lofty a position in Islamic society also fueled antisemitism and massacres. In Andalusian Spain, ibn Hazm and Abu Ishaq focused their anti-Jewish writings on this allegation. This was also the chief motivation behind the 1066 Granada massacre, when &quot;[m]ore than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day&quot;, and in Fez in 1033, when 6,000 Jews were killed. There were further massacres in Fez in 1276 and 1465.

In 1354, Muslim mobs in Egypt &quot;ran amok ... attacking Christians and Jews in the streets, and throwing them into bonfires if they refused to pronounce the &quot;shadādatayn&quot;.&quot;

The Almohads wreaked enormous destruction on both the Jewish and Christian populations in Spain and North Africa. This devastation, massacre, captivity, and forced conversion was described by the Jewish chronicler Abraham ibn Daud and the poet Abraham ibn Ezra. Suspicious of the sincerity of the Jewish converts to Islam, Muslim &quot;inquisitors&quot; took children from their families and placed them in the care of Muslim educators.

Maimonides, who had to flee from Almohad-controlled Iberia with his family, said &quot;God has hurled us in the midst of this people, the Arabs, who have persecuted us severely, and passed baneful and discriminatory legislation against us. Never did a nation molest, degrade, debase, and hate us as much as they. We bear the inhumane burden of their humiliation, lies and absurdities, being as the prophet said, &#x27;like a deaf man who does not hear or a dumb man who does not open his mouth&#x27; ... Our sages disciplined us to bear Ishmael&#x27;s lies and absurdities, listening in silence, and we have trained ourselves, old and young, to endure their humiliation, as Isaiah said, &#x27;I have given my back to the smiters, and my cheek to the beard pullers.

==Early modern period==
The Jews suffered during the Ottoman conquests and policies of colonization and population transfers (the surgun system). This resulted in the disappearance of several Jewish communities, including Salonica, and their replacement by Jewish refugees from Spain. Joseph R. Hacker observes:
Hacker concludes that the friendly policies of Mehmed and the good reception by Bayezid II of Spanish Jews likely caused 16th century Jewish writers to overlook both the destruction Byzantine Jews suffered during the Ottoman conquests and the later outbursts of oppression under Bayezid II and Selim I.

Sultan Murad IV feared that the Ottoman decline was a punishment from Allah for being lax on the enforcement of the sharia. In 1631, he issued a decree re-enforcing the dress restrictions for &quot;dhimmi&quot;s, to ensure they would &quot;feel themselves subdued&quot; (Qur’an 9:29):
When a fire devastated much of Constantinople in 1660, the Ottomans blamed the Jews and expelled them from the city. Inscribed in the royal mosque in Constantinople was a reference to Prophets Muhammad&#x27;s expulsion of the Jews from Medina; the mosque&#x27;s endowment deed has a reference to &quot;the Jews who are the enemy of Islam.&quot;

In the Zaydi imamate of Yemen, Jews were singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of Tihamah, and which became known as the Mawza Exile.

==Late modern period==
===Muslim world===

The Damascus affair occurred in 1840 when an Italian monk and his servant disappeared in Damascus. Immediately following, a charge of ritual murder was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of the United Kingdom, France and Germany as well as Ottoman authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.

There was a massacre of Jews in Baghdad in 1828. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.

In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. This is known as the Allahdad incident. Between 30 and 40 people were killed, and it was only by forcible conversion that a large-scale massacre was averted.
In Palestine there were riots and pogroms against Jews in 1920 and 1921. Tensions over the Western Wall in Jerusalem led to the 1929 Palestine riots, whose main victims were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron.

In 1941, following Rashid Ali&#x27;s pro-Axis coup, riots known as the &quot;Farhud&quot; broke out in Baghdad, during which approximately 180 Jews were killed, about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted, and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four Syrian Jewish women were discovered by border police in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak, 24, her sisters, Lulu Zeibak, 23, Mazal Zeibak, 22 and their cousin, Eva Saad, 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee from Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girls&#x27; bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre. Syrian authorities deposited the bodies of all six in sacks before the homes of their parents in the Jewish ghetto in Damascus.

===Nazi Germany===
The persecution of Jews reached its most destructive form in the policies of Nazi Germany, which made the destruction of Jews a high priority, starting with the persecution of Jews and culminating in the killing of approximately 6,000,000 Jews during World War II and the Holocaust from 1941 to 1945. Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews who lived in the territories that they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the Final Solution, the genocide of the Jews of Europe, and increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing extermination camps for the specific purpose of killing Jews as well as other perceived undesirables such as people who openly opposed Hitler.

This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to disease-ridden and massively overcrowded ghettos were transported (often by train) to death camps, where some of them were herded into a specific location (often a gas chamber), then they were either gassed or shot to death. Other prisoners simply committed suicide, unable to go on after witnessing the horrors of camp life. Afterward, their bodies were often searched for any valuable or useful materials, such as gold fillings, women&#x27;s hair was cut off, and then their remains were either buried in mass graves or burned. Others were interned in the camps and during their internment, they were given little food and disease was rampant.

Escapes from the camps were few, but they were not unknown. For example, the few escapes from Auschwitz that succeeded were made possible by the Polish underground (which operated inside the camp) and local people who lived outside. In 1940, the Auschwitz commandant claimed that &quot;the local population is fanatically Polish and ... prepared to take any action against the hated SS camp personnel. Every prisoner who managed to escape can count on help the moment he reaches the wall of the first Polish farmstead.&quot;

===Apartheid South Africa===
During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party leaders and wide sections of the Afrikaner people strongly came under the influence of the Nazi movement that dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945. There were many reasons for this. Germany was the traditional enemy of Britain, and whoever opposed Britain was seen as a friend of the Nationalists. Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the British Empire in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about to dawn.

During the 1930s, the Nationalists found much in common with the &#x27;South African Gentile National Socialist Movement&#x27;, headed by Johannes von Strauss von Moltke, whose objective was to combat and destroy the alleged &#x27;perversive influence of the Jews in economics, culture, religion, ethics and statecraft, and re-establish European Aryan control in South Africa for the welfare of the Christian peoples of South Africa&#x27;.

===Tsarist Russia===
For much of the 19th century, Imperial Russia, which included much of Poland, Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic states, contained the world&#x27;s largest Jewish population. From Alexander III&#x27;s reign until the end of Tsarist rule in Russia, many Jews were often restricted to the Jewish Pale of Settlement and they were also banned from many jobs and locations. Jews were subject to racial laws, such as the May Laws, and they were also targeted in hundreds of violent anti-Jewish riots, called pogroms, which received unofficial state support. During this period a hoax document alleging a global Jewish conspiracy, &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, was published.

The Tsarist government implemented policies that ensured that the Jews would remain isolated. However, the government tolerated the existence of their religious and national institutions and it also allowed them to emigrate. The restrictions and discriminatory laws drove many Russian Jews to embrace liberal and socialist causes. However, following the Russian Revolution, many politically active Jews forfeited their Jewish identity. According to Leon Trotsky, &quot;[Jews] considered themselves neither Jews nor Russians but socialists. To them, Jews were not a nation but a class of exploiters whose fate it was to dissolve and assimilate.&quot; In the aftermath of the overthrow of Tsarist Russia, Jews found themselves in a tragic predicament. Conservative Russians saw them as a disloyal and subversive element, while the radicals viewed the Jews as a doomed social class.

==Contemporary period==
===Soviet Union===
Even though many of the Old Bolsheviks were ethnically Jewish, they sought to uproot Judaism and Zionism and to achieve this goal, they established the &quot;Yevsektsiya&quot;. By the end of the 1940s, the Communist leadership of the former USSR had liquidated almost all Jewish organizations, with the exception of a few token synagogues. These synagogues were then placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informants. They were strongly opposed to Judaism (and indeed to any religion) and conducted an extensive campaign to suppress the religious traditions among the Jewish population, alongside the traditional Jewish culture.

After 1948, antisemitism reached new heights in the Soviet Union, especially during the anti-cosmopolitan campaign, in which numerous Yiddish-writing poets, writers, painters and sculptors were arrested or killed. This campaign culminated in the so-called Doctors&#x27; plot, in which a group of doctors (almost all of whom were Jewish) were subjected to a show trial for supposedly having plotted to assassinate Stalin. Although repression eased after Stalin&#x27;s death, persecution of Jews would continue until the late 1980s (see: refuseniks).

===Middle East===
While Jews have been present in the Middle East since ancient times and have been a part of some societies, they have faced historical persecution, which has been ongoing in Middle Eastern countries with minority Jewish populations. Though in the medieval era, many Jewish people were integrated into their environment, yet most Jews did not assimilate into Muslim culture, and retained their religious and cultural identity. There have been many anti-Jewish riots in the region, such as 1945 anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania and 1967 Tripoli pogrom. Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and 1967 Arab–Israeli War, the vast majority of Middle Eastern Jews fled the Muslim Middle-east countries and moved to Israel and the Western countries.

===Lebanon===
In 1911, Jews from Italy, Greece, Syria, and some other countries moved to Beirut, expanding the local community. For a brief period under the French Mandate of Lebanon and 1926 Constitution of Lebanon, the Jewish community of Lebanon was constitutionally protected, however, outside of Beirut, the attitudes toward Jews were often hostile.

After 1947, the security of Jews remained fragile, and the main synagogue in Beirut was bombed in the early 1950s, and the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies moved a unanimous resolution to and exclude Jews from the Lebanese Army.

In the wake of the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, there was mass emigration of around 6,000 Lebanese Jews from Lebanon to Italy, Israel, Canada, United States, and some other Western countries.

The Lebanese Civil War, which started in 1975, brought immense suffering for the remaining Lebanese Jewish community, leading to a mass exodus of over 1,800 of the remaining Lebanese Jews. 1982 Lebanon-Israel war further reduced the number of Jews in the country.

As of 2005, the Jewish quarter of Beirut, Wadi Abu Jamil, was virtually abandoned, and the synagogue was in a dilapidated condition after the assassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and there were only around 40 elderly Jews left in Beirut, almost bringing an end to the History of the Jews in Lebanon.

===Libya===
====1945 anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania ====
In 1945, there were anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania, in which over 140 people were killed. Again in 1948 Anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania, 14 Jewish people were killed.

====1967 Tripoli anti-Jewish pogrom====
In June 1967, an anti-Jewish pogrom took place in Tripoli. The 1967 riot broke out in response to the Six-Day War between Israel and the Arab world. Arab leaders, especially Gamal Abdel Nasser, broadcast public statements calling for the destruction of Israel and in support for the Arab cause.

On the night of 5 June 1967, the day the war started, a mob of hundreds of Muslim Libyans attacked Jewish homes and businesses in the city&#x27;s Jewish Quarter, burning the Bet-El synagogue to the ground. Rioters attacked and set fire to Jewish houses, stores and cars, in addition to looting Jewish properties. Of all Jewish assets, both public and private, 60% were destroyed.

King Idris of Libya tried to evacuate the Jewish population, transporting 3,000 Jews into a former British military base in the Libyan Desert. Staff of the Italian Alitalia airline also shielded Jews who had fled to the airport for safety; the airline staff also helped repel rioting mobs from getting to the airport and provided numerous plane tickets to Jews so they could escape safely. Alitalia&#x27;s efforts were assisted by Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff and the Government of Italy.

According to sources, at least 18 Jews were killed in the pogrom, and another 25 were injured.

The pogrom was beginning of the end for Jews in Libya. 4,100 Jews managed to flee the country to Italy, including 2,500 who arrived to Rome via Alitalia. After Muammar Gaddafi took power in a 1969 coup, he ordered a persecution campaign against his country&#x27;s Jewish minority, which led to the remaining 100 Jews fleeing the country.

<doc id="1262058" wikidata="Q14707120" url="?curid=1262058" title="Norwood, Bronx">
<text>Norwood, also known as Bainbridge, is a residential neighborhood in the northwest Bronx, New York City, U.S. It is bound by Van Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn Cemetery to the north, the Bronx River to the east, and Mosholu Parkway to the southwest. The area is dominated topographically by what was once Valentine&#x27;s Hill, the highest point being near the intersection of 210th Street and Bainbridge Avenue, where Gun Hill Road intersects, and around the Montefiore Medical Center, the largest landowner and employer of the neighborhood. Norwood&#x27;s main commercial arteries are Gun Hill Road, Jerome Avenue, Webster Avenue, and Bainbridge Avenue.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 7 and is patrolled by the NYPD&#x27;s 52nd Precinct. As of the 2000 United States Census, the seven census tracts that make up the neighborhood had a population of 40,748.

==Name==
Due to its use in city publications, subway maps, and local media, &quot;Norwood&quot; is the neighborhood&#x27;s more common name, but the area is also known as &quot;Bainbridge&quot;, most consistently within the neighborhood&#x27;s formerly Irish American community that is centered on the commercial zone of Bainbridge Avenue and East 204th Street. The name &quot;Norwood&quot; itself does not carry a great deal of currency as do nearby neighborhoods such as Riverdale and Woodlawn.

==History==
At the time of the Civil War, the area was Westchester County farmland on the border of West Farms and Yonkers. Chief property owners included the Valentine, Varian, and Bussing families. Woodlawn Cemetery was founded in 1863 to the north. Annexed to New York City in 1873 along with the rest of the West Bronx, the area&#x27;s character shifted from rural to suburban by the turn of the 20th century. The neighborhood&#x27;s streets in their present form were laid out in 1889 by Josiah Briggs between Middlebrook Parkway (renamed Mosholu Parkway) and Woodlawn Cemetery. Contemporary maps show that it was then considered part of Williamsbridge, with which it continues to share a post office. Williamsbridge Reservoir was opened in 1890, transforming the natural lake into an artery that served the New York City water supply system until no longer needed in 1934.

A tract of land, known as &quot;Columbia Oval&quot; was owned by Columbia University at Gun Hill Road and Bainbridge Avenue. Columbia Oval was used for sporting events including the first United States marathon (40 km), from Stamford, Connecticut in 1896. (The winner of that marathon was John McDermott, who later won the first Boston marathon.) Columbia Oval became the site of Columbia University&#x27;s War Hospital, which was taken over by the United States Army as &quot;U.S. Army General Hospital No. 1&quot; during the World War I.

The area went through a series of names around the turn of the 20th century, including North Bedford Park, after the neighborhood to the south, and Brendan Hill, after St. Brendan the Navigator and the parish church, established in 1908, that bears his name. The name Brendan Hill was made official by the Board of Aldermen in 1910. The name Norwood is first attributed in the form Norwood Heights—either in honor of Carlisle Norwood, a friend of Leonard Jerome, or simply a contraction of &quot;North Woods&quot;, common to a number of places in the English-speaking world.

In the first half of the 20th century Norwood shared with the rest of the Bronx a population made up largely of European-origin Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish families affluent enough to leave Manhattan. These populations were joined by Puerto Ricans during the Great Depression and post World War II eras, and, post-1965, by other Latinos (especially Dominicans), Bangladeshis, Albanians, West Indians (especially Guyanese), West Africans (especially Ghanaians), and a new group of Irish immigrants.

=== Irish population ===
In the 1970s through the 1990s the neighborhood was well known for its Irish and Irish American population, having attracted a number of immigrants from Catholic areas of Northern Ireland who fled the Troubles, and others seeking work. During this time that the neighborhood became known by two more names: Bainbridge, after the Bainbridge Avenue – East 204th Street commercial strip – included Irish restaurants, groceries, and pubs, and Little Belfast, after the city from which many immigrants came.

The area contributed much in Irish and Irish-American culture and politics during this time. The musical group Black 47, made up of Irish expatriates, first made their name touring the bar scene here. Their lyrics would go on to reflect the experiences of the Irish in the area, in such songs as &quot;Funky Ceílí&quot;, &quot;Her Dear Donegal&quot;, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Bronx&quot;. Irish pubs in the area attracted press attention as centers of strong support for Irish republicanism, which supports ending the remaining British rule in Ireland. A few pubs hosted benefits for Noraid, the Northern Irish Aid Committee, accused by Unionists of gun running for the Irish Republican Army (IRA). At least one area bar, The Phoenix, was raided by law enforcement in 1994, with Irish authorities simultaneously raiding its owner&#x27;s holiday home in Donegal. Thomas Maguire, the owner, and five others, were charged with smuggling thousands of bomb detonators to Ireland from Tucson via New York. A jury found the defendants not guilty on all counts.

A number of factors have contributed to the decline of the Irish population in Bainbridge. The most critical was the downturn in the US economy which forced many Irish immigrants to return to Ireland or to seek work in Germany (whose reunification process coincided with the American recession). A substantial portion of the Irish population were illegally in the country, and thus subject to INS investigation and deportation. The end of the Troubles period, with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, encouraged some residents to return voluntarily to Ireland, particularly with the improvement of the northern economy. The growth of the economy of the Republic of Ireland – the so-called &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; – persuaded some residents to move there. Others have continued to live in New York, moving to the Bronx neighborhoods of Riverdale and Woodlawn Heights, or to nearby Yonkers. The same factors which encouraged return to Ireland have also discouraged further immigration to Bainbridge. Most of the Irish American residents moved out of the area due to over-population and the area becoming an economically depressed neighborhood. Irish pubs were replaced by &quot;99 Cent&quot; stores. The last Irish pub, McDwyers Pub, closed down in 2011.
