<text>The Great Lakes Bowl was an American college football bowl game that was played only once, on December 6, 1947 in Cleveland, Ohio between the Kentucky Wildcats and the Villanova Wildcats. The game was played at Cleveland Stadium with attendance of 14,908.

Kentucky of the Southeastern Conference was in its second season under coach Bear Bryant. They brought a 7–3 record into the game, their losses coming to Ole Miss (ranked #13 in the final AP Poll of the season), Alabama (ranked #6 in the final AP Poll of the season) and Tennessee.

The Villanova Wildcats, coached by Jordan Olivar, brought a 6–2–1 record into the game, having lost to Army and Boston College. It was the first bowl appearance for Kentucky and the second for Villanova, which in 1936 tied Auburn, 7–7, in the Bacardi Bowl in Havana, Cuba. Neither team was ranked entering the game, though Kentucky had spent three weeks in the AP top twenty in October, rising as high as #13.

==Game summary==
In the first quarter Kentucky&#x27;s George Blanda kicked a 27-yard field goal. At halftime Kentucky led 3–0. In the third quarter Kentucky&#x27;s Jim Howe had a 29-yard touchdown run; Blanda&#x27;s point after kick gave Kentucky a 10–0 lead.

Yet Villanova, behind the accurate throws of highly touted quarterback Andy Gordon, marched back. Two plays into the fourth period, Villanova&#x27;s Ralph Pasquariello, carrying several Kentucky defenders on his back, rambled 11-yards into the endzone. John Siano&#x27;s conversion pulled Villanova within a field goal, 10–7.

Later in the fourth quarter, Kentucky&#x27;s Jack Griffin broke through the Villanova line to partially block a punt, giving Kentucky excellent field position at the 25-yard line. Several plays later, Kentucky&#x27;s Bill Boller raced 25 yards for a touchdown, and after the Blanda extra-point, Kentucky had cushioned its lead to 17–7. With time now against them, Villanova went to the air, but Kentucky&#x27;s Boller intercepted a Gordon pass and returned it 49 yards for another touchdown. Now trailing 24–7, Gordon returned to the air first hitting Zip Zehler with a 38-yard strike, Gordon then connected with John Sheehan for a 13-yard touchdown pass. With the Siano conversion the score was 24–14.

Villanova&#x27;s Joe Rogers, Captain of the squad for the game, also made sizable gains during the game.

The Great Lakes Bowl was never played again as a major bowl game, but did take place in 1948 as a small college bowl game where John Carroll University defeated Canisius College 14–13.

Kentucky and Villanova met again in the regular season the following year. They tied 13–13 in Lexington, Kentucky, on November 6, 1948.

===Scoring summary===
*Kentucky — George Blanda 27-yard field goal
*Kentucky — Howe 29-yard run (George Blanda kick)
*Villanova — Pasquariello 11-yard run (John Siano kick)
*Kentucky — Boller 25-yard run (George Blanda kick)

<text>PC Fútbol was a series of football management simulation games developed by Spanish developers Dinamic Multimedia. It was one of the big successes in the Spanish PC market, spawning several titles from 1992 until the studio&#x27;s closure in 2001. The series was later revived in 2004 by developers Gaelco and there were two more releases before the series final demise.

==History==
&quot;PC Fútbol&quot; was a significant hit in Spain; &quot;Marca&quot;″s Marcos Anton wrote that it &quot;became an absolute legend of the genre&quot;. Its first installment sold 7,000 copies in Spain, while &quot;PC Fútbol 7&quot; reached domestic sales of 360,000 copies. The games were always sold at a budget price, usually in kiosks, and were always fiercely championed by the local press. Unlike most other football sims at the time, the game (since 2.0) allowed to take both player (dubbed &quot;arcade&quot;) and managerial approach to the game, a formula that was not used in mainstream games until &quot;Total Club Manager 2004&quot; allowed FIFA Football 2004 owners to actually play the game (which in its turn was modeled after Ascaron&#x27;s Anstoss series).

Former Liverpool player and Spanish television pundit, Michael Robinson was the face and voice of the game, and most of the season analysis inside the updates was signed by him. The game was one of the first licensed games - by the &quot;Liga de Fútbol Profesional&quot; - which meant that the developers were able to use real player and team names.

One of the most distinguishable features of the series were the updates; the game had a built-in calendar and league tracking utility and so owners of the game could connect to Dinamic&#x27;s servers and update their data monthly. Some of the data (like photos) could not be fit inside a floppy, and data packs were made available in gaming magazines or via direct request. As the CD-ROM replaced the floppy versions (around 1996), there was no need for additional data packs, but there was still a final update (released in the end of the season) that would complete all league tracking data and Robinsons&#x27; comments.

The later games (2000 and 2001) were plagued by bugs, and although the updates assured a less problematic gaming experience, it had worn some of the userbase, who could finally have fully licensed alternatives from EA Sports and Sports Interactive (FIFA/Stars and Championship Manager, respectively). By mid-2001 &quot;PC Fútbol 2001&quot; support ceased, and Dinamic closed shortly after. A complete modification (&quot;mod&quot;) of the game was released shortly after, showing a still dedicated fan-base. A total of nine titles in the main series were released, the first simply numbered, and the final two &quot;2000&quot; and &quot;2001&quot;, and sold around 1 million copies altogether.

In 2004, Planeta DeAgostini acquired the rights to the name and released &quot;PC Fútbol 2005&quot;, developed by Gaelco. It continued the &quot;tradition&quot; of bug-ridden games of the early games, and although it sold very well in December 2004 (second only to &quot;The Sims 2&quot;), most fans were disappointed with it.

After numerous attempts to revive the successful series, in 2023 the launch of the game on PC was announced, but in 2024 the pre-sale was suspended amidst much controversy. 

In 2024, the release of PC Fútbol 8, expected on April 30th on Steam was confirmed, but on 25th April, it was postponed to 17th May. On May 15th, the release was postponed again to June 7th, but on May 20th, another email from &quot;Una partida más&quot; moved the release date forward to May 27th.

By July 24th, 2024, the game had not been released, leading to considerable controversy.

==Other titles==
There were a number of titles released outside the main series: &quot;PC Calcio&quot; and &quot;PC Premier&quot; focused on the Italian and English football championships, and &quot;PC Clausura&quot;, aimed at Argentine market. Before the Euro&#x27;96, &quot;PC Selección&#x27;96&quot;, gave players the control of the Spanish team for the same tournament.

==PC Fútbol abroad==
Since the first versions of the game were only available in Spanish, the series market was limited, but the success was wide. In 1994 Dinamic Multimedia decided to reach the Italian and Argentine markets and published PC Calcio and PC Fútbol Clausura. Both were successful and followed by other versions each year.

In 1996, Gremlin approached the Spanish company to develop new titles on their highly regarded &quot;Premier Manager&quot; series. Three games were released using the PC Fútbol engine, from 1997 to 1999. In 2000, &quot;EuroLeague Football&quot;, an English oriented version of PC Fútbol 2000 was released, published by Sold-Out Software.

Instead, it&#x27;s a largely folk-pop album, which has been described by Stewart Mason as &quot;Joni Mitchell&#x27;s early-&#x27;70s albums viewed through a post-punk prism&quot;.

<text>&quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; was a speech delivered by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 4 June 1940. This was the second of three major speeches given around the period of the Battle of France; the others are the &quot;Blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; speech of 13 May 1940, and the &quot;This was their finest hour&quot; speech of 18 June 1940. Events developed dramatically over the five-week period, and although broadly similar in themes, each speech addressed a different military and diplomatic context.

In this speech, Churchill had to describe a great military disaster, and warn of a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany, without casting doubt on eventual victory. He also had to prepare his domestic audience for France&#x27;s falling out of the war without in any way releasing France to do so, and wished to reiterate a policy and an aim unchangeddespite the intervening eventsfrom his speech of 13 May, in which he had declared the goal of &quot;victory, however long and hard the road may be&quot;.

== Background ==
Winston Churchill took over as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, eight months after the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He had done so as the head of a multiparty coalition government, which had replaced the previous government (led by Neville Chamberlain) as a result of dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war, demonstrated by the Norway debate on the Allied evacuation of Southern Norway.

Coincidentally, the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; offensive in the Low Countries and France had begun on 10 May with the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Churchill had spoken to the House of Commons as Prime Minister for the first time on 13 May, to announce the formation of the new administration:

In that speech, he mentioned nothing about the military situation in France and the Low Countries.

Expecting that the German offensive would develop along much the same lines as it did in 1914, the lines of communication of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not run through the &quot;short crossing&quot; Channel portsBoulogne, Calais, Dunkirk, etc.but rather through Dieppe and Le Havre. On 13 May, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s attack through the Ardennes had reached the Meuse River at Sedan and then crossed it, breaking through the defences of the French Army. By 20 May, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; armoured divisions had reached the coast of the English Channel at Abbeville, splitting the BEF and the French First Army from the main French forces.

The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; next moved against the cut-off Allied forces, moving along the seacoast with only small Allied forces to resist them. After the capitulation of Belgium on 28 May, a gap had also appeared on the eastern flank of the Allied forces, which had been forced to retreat into a small pocket around the seaport of Dunkirk. From this pocket the bulk of the BEF and a considerable number of French troops had been evacuated in Operation Dynamo, but these troops had left behind virtually all of their heavy equipment (transport, tanks, artillery and ammunition). The French First Army had most of its units pocketed around Lille. Those of its units evacuated from Dunkirk were relanded in France, but saw no further action; they were still being reorganised in Brittany at the fall of France.

Churchill had made a brief statement to the Commons on 28 May reporting the Belgian capitulation, and concluding: 

He had promised a further statement of the military situation on 4 June, and indeed the major part of the speech is an account of military eventsso far as they affected the BEFsince the German breakthrough at Sedan.

The German breakthrough had not been exploited southwards, and the French had improvised a relatively thinly held defensive line along the Aisne and the Somme. The British military evaluation was that this was unlikely to withstand any major attack by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. In the air, the French were short of fighter planes, and the shortage was worsening due to their many losses in combat. The French military commanders had hence asked for additional British fighter squadrons to be sent into the fight in France. Politically, there were considerable doubts over the French willingness to continue the war, even in the absence of any further military catastrophes. Churchill had argued in favour of sending the fighter squadrons to France because he considered that that move would be vital to sustain French public morale, and also to give no excuse for the collapse of the French Army. That would possibly lead to a French government that would not only drop out of the war, but also become hostile to the United Kingdom. The British War Cabinet discussed this issue at meetings on 3 June and on the morning of 4 June, but it decided to take the advice of the Royal Air Force and the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, that the British priority must be to prepare its own defences. The three squadrons present in France would be kept up to fighting strength, but no further squadrons could be spared for the Battle of France.

Despite relief that the bulk of the BEF had made it back to Britain, Mass-Observation reported civilian morale in many areas as zero, one observer claiming that everyone looked suicidal. Only half the population expected Britain to fight on, and the feelings of thousands were summed up as: 

Therefore, when talking about the future course and conduct of the war in this speech, Churchill had to describe a great military disaster, and warn of a possible German invasion attempt, without casting doubt on eventual victory. He needed to prepare his domestic audience for France&#x27;s departure from the war without in any way releasing France to do so. In his subsequent speech of 18 June, immediately after the French had sued for peace, Churchill said:

Finally, he needed to reiterate a policy and an aim unchangeddespite the intervening eventsfrom his speech of 13 May, in which he had said:
===Possible inspiration===
S.L.A. Marshall commented that the speech may have partially been inspired by General Ferdinand Foch at the Doullens Conference, who reportedly asked Douglas Haig: 

Another source of inspiration might have been Georges Clemenceau who said, in June 1918:

==Peroration==

The peroration is widely held to be one of the finest oratorical moments of the war and of Churchill&#x27;s career.

It is often said that in the sentence that begins &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; and ends in &quot;surrender&quot;, only the last word&quot;&quot;does not have Old English roots.

==Reception==
It is said that immediately after giving the speech, Churchill muttered to a colleague, &quot;And we&#x27;ll fight them with the butt ends of broken beer bottles because that&#x27;s bloody well all we&#x27;ve got!&quot; Nonetheless, Churchill impressed his listeners and the speech was immediately recognised to be historic. Jock Colville, one of Churchill&#x27;s secretaries, noted in his diary &quot;A magnificent oration, which obviously moved the House.&quot; Chips Channon, a Conservative MP, wrote in his diary &quot;he was eloquent and oratorical and used magnificent English; several Labour members cried.&quot; A Labour MP, Josiah Wedgwood, friend and admirer of Churchill since the Dardanelles campaign, wrote to him, &quot;My dear Winston. That was worth 1,000 guns and the speeches of 1,000 years.&quot;

Unlike his subsequent &quot;This was their finest hour&quot; speech, Churchill&#x27;s 4 June speech in the House of Commons was not repeated by him as a live radio broadcast that evening. Rather, as with his earlier &quot;Blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; speech, extracts were read by the newsreader on that evening&#x27;s BBC news broadcast. They made a great impression on Vita Sackville-West:
The next year American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker wrote that its words &quot;deserve to be memorized by us all&quot;, observing that &quot;With Churchill&#x27;s picture these words are placarded in homes and offices throughout the British Empire.&quot;

==Recordings==

No audio record was made at the time of the original speech; Churchill only produced an audio recording in 1949, by repeating his previous oration. Despite this, many people after the war misremembered that they had heard Churchill speaking on the radio in 1940 when all there had been were BBC news reports that quoted his words. 

In 1984, English heavy metal band Iron Maiden mixed a section of this recording at the beginning of the video for their song &quot;Aces High&quot;, which is inspired by the Battle of Britain, also using the recording as the introduction to the song when performed on stage, Iron Maiden also use this section as a beginning for many live shows namely during their 1984 World Slavery Tour. In &quot;Fool&#x27;s Overture&quot;, the closing track of Supertramp&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot;, some excerpts of the speech are heard along with London&#x27;s Big Ben chiming.

==Popular myths==
Two popular myths are commonly propagated in newspapers and blogs. In 1972, actor Norman Shelley claimed to have recorded the speech impersonating Churchill. They featured in a 1994 book, 2000 Economist article, and an Atlantic article from 2002 by Christopher Hitchens, containing the following claims: 

Myth 1: The speech was supposedly orated by the actor Norman Shelley, possibly because Churchill was too drunk. Shelley did indeed make a phonograph recording in 1942 of a different Churchill speech, but never impersonated the Prime Minister over the airwaves.

Myth 2: The most remembered part of the speech was supposedly inspired by a radio address by the former PM, Neville Chamberlain, which included the following sentences: 
This frequently cited Chamberlain quote is found in the 1946 book &quot;The life of Neville Chamberlain&quot; by Keith Feiling; however, referring to a &quot;June 30 [...] broadcast&quot;, which would date it after the original Churchill speech.

<doc id="1240947" wikidata="Q635926" url="?curid=1240947" title="Hackney horse">
<text>The Hackney is a recognized breed of horse that was developed in Great Britain. In recent decades, the breeding of the Hackney has been directed toward producing horses that are ideal for carriage driving. They are an elegant high stepping breed of carriage horse that is popular for showing in harness events. Hackneys possess good stamina, and are capable of trotting at high speed for extended periods of time.

==Breed history==
The Hackney Horse breed was developed in the 14th century in Norfolk when the King of England required powerful but attractive horses with an excellent trot, to be used for general purpose riding horses. Since roads were rudimentary in those times, Hackneys were a primary riding horse, riding being the common mode of equine transportation. The trotting horses were more suitable as war horses than amblers with their pacing gaits. As a result, in 1542 King Henry VIII required his wealthy subjects keep a specified number of trotting horse stallions for breeding use.

In about 1729 a Norfolk Trotter stallion and an Arabian stallion contributed to the foundation stock for the modern Hackney Horse. The resulting Norfolk Roadster, as it was known, was a heavily built horse that was used as a work horse by farmers and others. It was also a fast horse with good stamina.

Another famous horse was the stallion Original Shales, foaled in East Anglia in 1755. He was by the stallion Blaze, the son of the famous undefeated racehorse, Flying Childers who was a grandson of the great Darley Arabian (one of the three foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed). Original Shales sired two stallions—Scot Shales and Driver—both of which had a great influence on the Norfolk Trotter.

Messenger (GB), a 1780 grandson of Sampson, was a foundation sire of the present American Standardbred horse. Hambletonian 10 had at least three crosses of Messenger in the third and fourth generations of his pedigree (3x4x4). In the 1820s &quot;Norfolk Cob&quot; was recorded as having done 2 miles in 5 minutes 4 seconds and was one of the famous horses of that breed along with &quot;Nonpareil,&quot; who was driven 100 miles in 9 hours 56 minutes 57 seconds.

In 1820 Bellfounder a Norfolk Trotter stallion who was able to trot 17 miles in an hour with 14 stone up, was exported to America where he was the damsire of Hambletonian 10. In this era, match-trotters competed under saddle, not harness. Later with improvements in roads, the Hackney was also used in harness, and he was then a riding and driving horse of high merit.

Robert and Philip Ramsdale, father and son, took the Norfolk horses Wroot&#x27;s Pretender and Phenomenon to Yorkshire, where they bred them with Yorkshire trotting mares. In July 1800, the celebrated Hackney mare, Phenomenon, was backed to trot 17 miles in 56 minutes for a bet of £400, which she did in 53 minutes. In 1832, one of Phenomenon&#x27;s daughters, the 14  hands Phenomena, trotted 17 miles in only 53 minutes. During the 19th century, with the expansion of the railway, the Norfolk breed fell out of favour, to be revived later by the Hackney Horse Society. The Norfolk and Yorkshire Trotter were selectively bred for elegant style and speed, and were developed into the modern Hackney Horse. The brilliant gaits of the Hackney Horse, however, saved it from extinction, and began its use in the show ring. They are still extremely successful in harness, and can also produce very nice riding horses, many known for their ability in show jumping and dressage competition.
In 1883, the Hackney Horse Society was formed in Norwich and the society’s stud book has records dating back to 1755 in the Hackney Stud Book.

Alexander Cassatt was responsible for the introduction of the Hackney Pony to the United States. In 1878 he acquired 239 Stella in Britain and brought her to Philadelphia. In 1891, Cassatt and other Hackney enthusiasts founded the American Hackney Horse Society which is based in Lexington, Kentucky.

Hackneys come in both pony and horse height ranges, and are one of the few breeds that recognize both pony and horse sizes. The Hackney Pony was developed in the late 19th century, when Hackney horses were bred to various pony breeds in order to create a very specific type of show pony.

==Breed characteristics==

The Hackney Horse&#x27;s height ranges from 14.2 hands (147 centimetres) to 16.2 hands (168 cm) tall. They may be any solid colour, including bay, brown, chestnut and black. Hackneys often have white markings, often due to the influence of sabino genetics.

The Hackney has a well-shaped head, sometimes with a slightly convex nose. Their eyes and ears are expressive and should show alertness. The neck is crested and muscular with a clean cut throat and jaw. The chest is broad and well-defined, the shoulder is powerful, long and gently sloping. The Hackneys have an average length of back, muscular, level croups, and powerful hindquarters. Their ribs are well-sprung. The tail is set high and carried high naturally. The legs are strong with broad, clean joints, long forearms and gaskins, with strong hocks, and pasterns medium in length, and are attached to round, fairly upright hooves.

In the trot, they exhibit showiness and an exaggerated high knee and hock action due to very good flexion of their joints. Their action should be straight and true with a distinct moment of suspension. The front legs reach up high with sharply bent knees that are stretched well forward with a ground covering stride. Their hind legs are well propelled underneath them in a similar exaggerated action. In addition to inherent soundness and endurance, the Hackney Horse has proven to be a breed with an easy, rhythmic canter, and a brisk, springy walk.
Hackneys have been exported into Australia, the United States and the Netherlands.

In April 2022 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust declared the breed was at risk, with just 31 breeding females and 12 males left in the UK.

<text>The Śiva·sūtras, technically akṣara·samāmnāya, variously called &quot;&quot;, &quot;pratyāhāra·sūtrāṇi&quot;, &quot;varṇa·samāmnāya&quot;, etc., refer to a set of fourteen aphorisms devised as an arrangement of the sounds of Sanskrit for the purposes of grammatical exposition as carried out by the grammarian Pāṇini in the Aṣṭādhyāyī.

Pāṇini himself uses the term &quot;akṣara·samāmnāya&quot; whereas the colloquial term &quot;Shiva sutra&quot; is a later development, as per claims by Nandikeśvara in his Kāśikā, that the god Śiva sounded his drum fourteen times to reveal these sounds to Pāṇini. They were either composed by Pāṇini to accompany his &quot;&quot; or predate him.

==Text and notation==

# ha L

Each verse consists of a group of basic Sanskrit phonemes (i.e. open syllables consisting either of initial vowels or consonants followed by the &quot;basic&quot; vowel &quot;a&quot;) followed by a single &#x27;dummy letter&#x27;, or &quot;anubandha&quot;, conventionally rendered in upper case and named &quot; by Pāṇini.

== &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot; ==
The following table shows the Shiva Sutras in Devnagri Script and their transliteration into the well-used transliteration scheme of Indic characters by Latin scripts viz. ISO 15919 and ITRANS.
==Scheme==

This allows Pāṇini to refer to groups of phonemes with &quot;&quot;, which consist of a phoneme-letter and an &quot;anubandha&quot; (and often the vowel &quot;a&quot; to aid pronunciation) and signify all of the intervening phonemes. &quot;Pratyāhāras&quot; are thus single syllables, but they can be declined (see Aṣṭādhyāyī 6.1.77 below). Hence the &quot;pratyāhāra&quot; &quot;aL&quot; refers to all phonemes (because it consists of the first phoneme of the first verse (&quot;a&quot;) and the last &quot;anubandha&quot; of the last verse (&quot;L&quot;)); &quot;aC&quot; refers to vowels (i.e., all of the phonemes before the &quot;anubandha&quot; &quot;C&quot;: i.e. &quot;a i u ṛ ḷ e o ai au&quot;); &quot;haL&quot; to consonants, and so on.

===Issues===

Note that some &quot;pratyāhāras&quot; are ambiguous. The &quot;anubandha&quot; &quot;Ṇ&quot; occurs twice in the list, which means that you can assign two different meanings to &quot;pratyāhāra&quot; &quot;aṆ&quot; (including or excluding &quot;ṛ&quot;, etc.); in fact, both of these meanings are used in the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;pratyāhāra&quot; &quot;haL&quot; is always used in the meaning &quot;all consonants&quot;—Pāṇini never uses &quot;pratyāhāras&quot; to refer to sets consisting of a single phoneme.

===Combinations===
From these 14 verses, a total of 280 &quot;pratyāhāras&quot; can be formed: 14*3 + 13*2 + 12*2 + 11*2 + 10*4 + 9*1 + 8*5 + 7*2 + 6*3 + 5*5 + 4*8 + 3*2 + 2*3 +1*1, minus 14 (as Pāṇini does not use single element &quot;pratyāhāras&quot;) minus 11 (as there are 11 duplicate sets due to &quot;h&quot; appearing twice); the second multiplier in each term represents the number of phonemes in each. But Pāṇini uses only 41 (with a 42nd introduced by later grammarians, &quot;raṆ&quot;=&quot;r l&quot;) &quot;pratyāhāras&quot; in the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot;.

===Arrangement===
The Akṣarasamāmnāya puts phonemes with a similar manner of articulation together (so sibilants in 13 &quot;śa ṣa sa R,&quot; nasals in 7 &quot;ñ m ṅ ṇ n M&quot;). Economy is a major principle of their organization, and it is debated whether Pāṇini deliberately encoded phonological patterns in them (as they were treated in traditional phonetic texts called Prātiśakyas) or simply grouped together phonemes which he needed to refer to in the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; and which only &quot;secondarily&quot; reflect phonological patterns. Pāṇini does not use the Akṣarasamāmnāya to refer to homorganic stops, but rather the &quot;anubandha&quot; &quot;U&quot;: to refer to the palatals &quot;c ch j jh&quot; he uses &quot;cU&quot;.

==Example==

As an example, consider &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; 6.1.77: &quot;&quot;:

* &quot;iK&quot; means &quot;i u ṛ ḷ&quot;, 
* &quot;iKaḥ&quot; is &quot;iK&quot; in the genitive case, so it means &#x27; in place of &quot;i u ṛ ḷ&quot;; 
* &quot;yaṆ&quot; means the semivowels &quot;y v r l&quot; and is in the nominative, so &quot;iKaḥ yaṆ&quot; means: &quot;y v r l&quot; replace &quot;i u ṛ ḷ&quot;.
* &quot;aC&quot; means all vowels, as noted above
* &quot;aCi&quot; is in the locative case, so it means &quot;before any vowel&quot;.

Hence this rule replaces a vowel with its corresponding semivowel when followed by any vowel, and that is why &#x27; together with &#x27; makes &quot;. To apply this rule correctly we must be aware of some of the other rules of the grammar, such as:
*1.1.49 &quot; which says that the genitive case in a sutra signifies &quot;in the place of&quot; 
*1.1.50 &quot;&quot; which says that in a substitution, the element in the substitute series that most closely resembles the letter to be substituted should be used (e.g. &quot;y&quot; for &quot;i&quot;, &quot;r&quot; for &quot;ṛ&quot; etc.)
*1.1.71 &#x27; which says that a sequence with an element at the beginning (e.g. &quot;i&quot;) and an &quot;IT&quot; letter (e.g. &quot;K&quot;) at the end stands for the intervening letters (i.e. &quot;i u ṛ ḷ&quot;, because the Akṣarasamāmnāya sutras read &#x27;).

Also, rules can be debarred by other rules:

* 6.1.101 &#x27; teaches that vowels (from the &quot;aK pratyāhāra&quot;) of the same quality come together to make a long vowel, so for instance &#x27; and &#x27; make &#x27;, not &#x27;. This &#x27; rule takes precedence over the general &quot;&quot; rule mentioned above, because this rule is more specific.

==Pratyāhāras==

Despite the possible combinations seen above, here are the 41 pratyāhāras in actual use by Pāṇini:

# &quot;aL&quot; ⇒ all sounds 
# &quot;ac&quot; ⇒ vowels 
# &quot;haL&quot; ⇒ consonants 

===Vowel groups===
# &quot;1aK&quot; ⇒ &quot;a i u ṛ ḷ&quot; 
# &quot;aṆ&quot; ⇒ &quot;a i u&quot;
# &quot;iC&quot; ⇒ &quot;i u ṛ ḷ e o ai au&quot; 
# &quot;iK&quot; ⇒ &quot;i u ṛ ḷ&quot;
# &quot;uK&quot; ⇒ &quot;u ṛ ḷ&quot;
# &quot;eC&quot; ⇒ &quot;e o ai au&quot; 
# &quot;eṆ&quot; ⇒ &quot;e o&quot;
# &quot;aiC&quot; ⇒ &quot;ai au&quot;

===Vowel and consonant groups===
# &quot;aŚ&quot; ⇒ vowels and voiced consonants
# &quot;aM&quot; ⇒ vowels, &quot;h&quot;, semivowels, and nasal stops

# &quot;aṬ&quot; ⇒ vowels, &quot;h&quot;, and semivowels other than &quot;l&quot;
# &quot;iṆ&quot; ⇒ vowels other than &quot;a&quot;; &quot;h&quot; and semivowels

===Consonant group===
# &quot;haŚ&quot; ⇒ voiced consonants 
# &quot;yaR&quot; ⇒ semivowels, stops, and voiceless spirants
# &quot;yaY&quot; ⇒ semivowels and stops
# &quot;yaÑ&quot; ⇒ semivowels, nasal stops, &quot;jh bh&quot;
# &quot;yaM&quot; ⇒ semivowels and nasal stops
# &quot;yaṆ&quot; ⇒ semivowels 
# &quot;vaL&quot; ⇒ consonants other than &quot;y&quot;
# &quot;vaŚ&quot; ⇒ voiced consonants other than &quot;y&quot;
# &quot;raL&quot; ⇒ consonants other than &quot;y&quot; and &quot;v&quot;
# &quot;ñaM&quot; ⇒ nasal stops
# &quot;maY&quot; ⇒ stops other than &quot;ñ&quot;
# &quot;ṅaM&quot; ⇒ &quot;ṅ ṇ n&quot;

# &quot;bhaṢ&quot; ⇒ voiced aspirated stops other than &quot;jh&quot;
# &quot;jaŚ&quot; ⇒ voiced unaspirated nonnasal stops
# &quot;baŚ&quot; ⇒ voiced unaspirated nonnasal stops other than &quot;j&quot;
# &quot;khaR&quot; ⇒ voiceless stops, voiceless aspirants
# &quot;khaY&quot; ⇒ voiceless stops
# &quot;chaV&quot; ⇒ &quot;ch ṭh th c ṭ t&quot;
# &quot;caY&quot; ⇒ voiceless unaspirated stops
# &quot;caR&quot; ⇒ voiceless unaspirated stops, voiceless spirants
# &quot;śaL&quot; ⇒ spirants
# &quot;śaR&quot; ⇒ voiceless spirants

<text>A war grave is a burial place for members of the armed forces or civilians who died during military campaigns or operations.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;war grave&quot; does not only apply to graves: ships sunk during wartime are often considered to be war graves, as are military aircraft that crash into water; this is particularly true if crewmen perished inside the vehicle. Classification of a war grave is not limited to the occupier&#x27;s death in combat but includes military personnel who die while in active service: for example, during the Crimean War, more military personnel died of disease than as a result of enemy action.

A common difference between cemeteries of war graves and those of civilian peacetime graves is the uniformity of those interred. They generally died during a relatively short period, in a small geographic area and consist of service members from the few military units involved. When it comes to the two World Wars, the large number of casualties means that the war graves can take up very large areas. For example, the Brookwood Military Cemetery in the UK is the largest of its kind in the country, with graves for more than 1,600 servicemen from the First World War and over 3,400 from the Second World War and covering an area of 15 hectares (37 acres). By contrast, Finnish war graves are generally small because the Finnish government decided following the Second World War that every dead soldier or service person would be returned to their home parish, meaning that virtually all Finnish churchyards contain a war grave.

== Jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the Office of Australian War Graves controls the maintenance of war cemeteries, plots, individual graves, post-war commemorations and battle exploit memorials.

=== Commonwealth ===
In the Commonwealth of Nations, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is responsible for the commemoration of 1.7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members at over 23,000 separate burial sites in 153 countries. It operates through the financial support of six member states (United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa).

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, 67 ship wrecks and all underwater military aircraft are &quot;protected places&quot; under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 which imposes restrictions on their exploration and marine salvage.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, war graves are protected by the Law 60/1962.

=== United States ===
In the United States, war graves are managed within the United States National Cemetery System and American Battle Monuments Commission.
=== Germany ===
In Germany the state is responsible for the war graves. In addition to soldiers, victims of National Socialism and the GDR also fall under the definition of &quot;war grave&quot;. Abroad, the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund deutscher Kriegsgräberfürsorge) takes over the care of German war dead. War graves are under legal protection and have permanent resting rights. The war grave sites are mostly integrated in civil cemeteries and can be found on almost all graveyards.

== In popular culture ==
Rupert Brooke&#x27;s 1914 poem, &quot;The Soldier&quot; – &quot;If I should die, think only this of me: / That there&#x27;s some corner of a foreign field / That is for ever England&quot;, is a patriotic poem about the possibility of dying abroad during a war. Brooke is himself buried in a war grave on Skyros in the Aegean Sea, having died while en route to fight in the Gallipoli Campaign.

The War Graves Photographic Project, founded in 2008, aims to create an archive of names and photographs of all military graves and memorials from 1914 to the present day from any nationality, although focus on Commonwealth soldiers.

<doc id="1240954" wikidata="Q3160794" url="?curid=1240954" title="Never was so much owed by so many to so few">
<text>&quot;Never was so much owed by so many to so few&quot; was a wartime speech delivered to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by British prime minister Winston Churchill on 20 August 1940. The name stems from the specific line in the speech, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;, referring to the ongoing efforts of the Royal Air Force and other Allied aircrew who were fighting in the Battle of Britain, the pivotal air battle with the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

The speech came amidst German plans for an invasion. At the end of June 1940, the Luftwaffe had a large numerical superiority over the Royal Air Force, with around 2,550 planes compared to the only 750 planes of the RAF. Pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain have been known as &quot;the Few&quot; ever since, at times being specifically commemorated for Battle of Britain Day, on 15 September. The speech has become one of Churchill&#x27;s most famous, along with &quot;we shall fight on the beaches&quot;, &quot;their finest hour&quot;, and &quot;blood, toil, tears, and sweat&quot;.

==Background==
Churchill apparently first said the famous sentence to Major general Hastings Ismay after exiting the Battle of Britain Bunker at RAF Uxbridge on 16 August, four days before the speech was given. He had been visiting the No. 11 Group RAF operations room during the day of a battle, where at one point every squadron in the group was engaged while more waves of German planes were crossing the coast. After the fighting had slowed that evening and Churchill and Ismay had departed for Chequers, Churchill said, &quot;Don&#x27;t speak to me; I have never been so moved.&quot; Several minutes later, he told Ismay, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot;

The speech was given as the United Kingdom prepared for an impending German invasion. Near the end of June 1940, codebreakers at Bletchley Park deciphered a message containing a request from a Flak Corps unit for detailed maps of the UK, suggesting that the Germans intended to land mobile anti-aircraft guns in Great Britain and Ireland. However, Hitler knew that any invasion attempt would only be successful if the Royal Air Force was weakened or destroyed.

== Speech ==

Churchill&#x27;s speech lasted nearly fifty minutes, in which he first stated &quot;Almost a year has passed since the war began, and it is natural for us, I think, to pause on our journey at this milestone and survey the dark, wide field&quot; going on to say that, so far, there had been many fewer casualties than at the same point in the First World War, stating that the war was not a &quot;prodigious slaughter&quot;, but instead a &quot;conflict of strategy, of organisation, of technical apparatus, of science, mechanics and morale&quot;.

Churchill stated that &quot;It is our intention to maintain and enforce a strict blockade not only of Germany but of Italy, France and all the other countries that have fallen into the German power&quot;.

Contrasting the fall of Europe under the Nazis, Churchill said &quot;Let us see what has happened on the other side of the scales. The British nation and the British Empire finding themselves alone, stood undismayed against disaster. No one flinched or wavered; nay, some who formerly thought of peace, now think only of war. Our people are united and resolved, as they have never been before. Death and ruin have become small things compared with the shame of defeat or failure in duty. We cannot tell what lies ahead. It may be that even greater ordeals lie before us. We shall face whatever is coming to us. We are sure of ourselves and of our cause and here then is the supreme fact which has emerged in these months of trial&quot;
He then spoke about Britain&#x27;s military preparedness with respect to the Army and Navy. In turning to the air war, he mentions the &quot;vast and admirable system of salvage, directed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, ensures the speediest return to the fighting line of damaged machines, and the most provident and speedy use of all the spare parts and material&quot; He then states that production of aircraft had increased significantly and would &quot;We hope, we believe&quot; that the United Kingdom could &quot;continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as the enemy pleases...&quot;. He praised British fighter pilots and aircrews, using the phrase that he had first said several days before:

While the speech is most well remembered for its praise of fighter pilots, it also commended bomber crews for their work and urged the public not to forget their actions.

He commented on his government&#x27;s decision to withdraw its forces from Somaliland the week before, explaining that the British position was untenable due to the French decision to surrender. Churchill also defended the blockade of Germany and its occupied territories, acknowledging that the blockade could cause suffering but laying the blame on the Nazis. He pledged to give food, aid, and relief to occupied countries once they had been &quot;wholly cleared of German forces&quot;, helping to lay the groundwork for post-war relief programs.

The final part of the speech was about the destroyers-for-bases deal, in which Britain gave the United States 99-year leases for military bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland in exchange for fifty American destroyers. No mention was made of the US giving the UK destroyers, and the decision was presented as a goodwill gesture in the interests of mutual security instead of a direct trade of British territories for ships.
Churchill ended on the subject of cooperation &quot;Undoubtedly this process means that these two great organisations of the English-speaking democracies, the British Empire and the United States, will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage. For my own part, looking out upon the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings. I could not stop it if I wished; no one can stop it. Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along. Let it roll. Let it roll on full flood, inexorable, irresistible, benignant, to broader lands and better days.&quot;

==Legacy==

The speech is well remembered for Churchill&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;the few&quot; when referring to Allied aircrew defending the United Kingdom; since then, they have been referred to as &quot;The Few&quot;. Nearly 3,000 aircrew from the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and other Allied countries took part in the Battle of Britain, a third of which were either killed or wounded. They have been honoured with ceremonies and flypasts on the anniversary of Battle of Britain Day, most recently on the 80th, 75th, and 70th anniversaries.

In 1981, Australian printmaker James Swan changed the quote to &quot;Never was so much owed to so many by so few&quot;
and replaced the airmen&#x27;s faces by those of Australian politicians he deemed especially blameworthy.

<doc id="1240955" wikidata="Q2375242" url="?curid=1240955" title="This was their finest hour">
<text>&quot;This was their finest hour&quot; was a speech delivered by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom on 18 June 1940, just over a month after he took over as Prime Minister at the head of an all-party coalition government.

It was the third of three speeches which he gave during the period of the Battle of France, after the &quot;Blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; speech of 13 May and the &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech of 4 June. &quot;This was their finest hour&quot; was made after France had sought an armistice on the evening of 16 June.

==Message==
In his speech, Churchill justified the low level of support it had been possible to give to France since the Dunkirk evacuation, and reported the successful evacuation of most of the supporting forces. He resisted pressure to purge the coalition of appeasers, or otherwise indulge in recrimination. He reviewed the forces still available to prevent or repel any attempted invasion, summing up the review as follows:

He reported messages of support from the Dominions and justified confidence in victory, even if it was not yet clear how that victory could be achieved.

==Peroration==
The peroration, even at a moment of great apparent danger to British national survival, talks not only of national survival and national interest but also of noble causes (freedom, Christian civilisation and the rights of small nations) for which Britain was fighting and for which Churchill thought the United States should and eventually would fight. &quot;The War Illustrated&quot; published the speech with the title If the Empire lasts a thousand years men will say, this was their finest hour.


==Preparation and delivery==
The speech was delivered to the Commons at 3:49 pm, and lasted 36 minutes. Churchill, as was his habit, made revisions to his 23-page typescript right up to and during the speech. The final passage of his typescript was laid out in blank verse format, which Churchill scholars consider reflective of the influence of the Psalms on his oratory style.

<doc id="1240956" wikidata="Q7895798" url="?curid=1240956" title="University of Minnesota Law School">
<text>The University of Minnesota Law School is the law school of the University of Minnesota, a public university in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The school confers four law degrees: a Juris Doctor (J.D.), a Master of Laws (LL.M.), a Master of Science in Patent Law (M.S.P.L.), and a Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.). The J.D. program offers a number of concentration opportunities, as well as dual and joint degree options with other graduate and professional schools of the university.

== History ==
The school was originally housed in Pattee Hall, named after the school&#x27;s first dean, William S. Pattee, who served from 1888 to 1911. Pattee&#x27;s personal books became the law library&#x27;s first collection. In 1928 the school moved to Fraser Hall, named after Prof. Everett Fraser who served as dean from 1920 to 1948. In 1978 the school moved to its present building, originally named the Law Center. In 1999–2001, the law school initiated and completed an expansion of its facilities on the west bank of the university campus. This larger building was renamed Walter F. Mondale Hall in honor of one of its most distinguished alumni, former vice president Walter Mondale (&#x27;56).

Along with Harvard Law School, the University of Minnesota Law School founded the Center for Computer-Assisted Legal Instruction (CALI) in 1982. CALI has grown to include the membership of nearly every law school in the US and the organization still has offices at the University of Minnesota Law School.

The law school has 704 professional students and most of them are members of the J.D. program,; the school maintains a 8:1 student-to-faculty ratio. Admission to the law school is selective. Half of the Class of 2024 had a GPA above 3.71 and/or an LSAT score above 166. The five-year average bar exam passage rate was 96.91%.

The law school&#x27;s 11th dean is Professor Garry W. Jenkins, formerly associate dean for academic affairs at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law and chief operating officer and general counsel of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.

== Cost of attendance; employment ==
Tuition for the 2020–2021 academic year are $43,704 for residents and $52,560 for non-residents. Over 95% of the students receive financial aid, including scholarships, to help fund their legal education. Law School scholarships are awarded at the time of admission and range from $5,000 to full tuition. The median starting salary for the 2015 graduates entering the private sector was over $115,000, with 93% of the Class of 2015 known to be employed as of March 2016. The most popular destinations for the 2015 graduates were California, Minnesota, New York, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin.

== U.S. Supreme Court clerkships ==

The law school ranked in the top 20 of law schools whose graduates secured U.S. Supreme Court clerkships in recent years. They include Kyle D. Hawkins (Class of 2009), who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito in the 2013 Term, and Amy L. Bergquist (Class of 2007), who clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the 2010 Term.

== Experiential learning ==
There are 24 nationally recognized legal education clinics, offering &quot;student attorneys&quot; the opportunity to handle real legal cases under the supervision of teaching attorneys, with over 50 percent of law students participating in at least one clinic program, which is twice the national average. In 2015, the law school&#x27;s faculty and students, working in the Center for New Americans, took a case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court and won a landmark decision that changed the law in the area of immigration.

Over 95 percent of second-year J.D. students participate in either a moot court or legal journal, such as the &quot;Minnesota Law Review&quot;. According to the prestigious law journal rankings recently released by Washington and Lee University School of Law, the &quot;Minnesota Law Review&quot;, currently celebrating its 100th volume, ranks 9th among all law reviews. Two journals were ranked at the very top in their subject areas: &quot;Law and Inequality&quot; (JLI) for family law and the &quot;Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp; Technology&quot; (MJLST) for energy law.

JLI has been the highest-ranked family law journal for four straight years. It also ranked 3rd in minority, race and ethnic issues, 7th in gender, women, and sexuality, and 20th in public policy, politics, and the law.

MJLST has been the highest-ranked energy law journal for eight consecutive years. MJLST was also ranked 3rd in health law, 4th in environmental, natural resources, and land use, 8th in science, technology, and computing, and 10th in intellectual property.

The &quot;Minnesota Journal of International Law&quot; ranked 16th among all international law journals, moving up from 23rd in 2014. The &quot;ABA Journal of Labor &amp; Employment Law&quot; is now ranked 4th for employment law. The law school&#x27;s faculty-edited journal, &quot;Constitutional Commentary&quot;, was ranked 2nd in legal history and 9th in constitutional law.

The school&#x27;s students have won the prestigious Burton Award for Legal Achievement nine times, making the law school one of only seven schools to have received these distinguished writing awards eight or more times.

== Prominent faculty ==
The school was ranked 15th among U.S. law schools, tied with the University of Michigan Law School, for the number of times its tenured faculty&#x27;s published scholarship was cited in legal journals during the period 2010 through 2014.

==Law Library==
The Law Library, with over 1 million volumes, is the 7th largest of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.law.umn.edu/library&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Riesenfeld Rare Books Research Center houses one of the top three collections of rare legal texts in the nation. For its millionth volume, the law school acquired the papers of Clarence Darrow.

==Study abroad programs==
The law school offers a number of study abroad opportunities and, in 2006 opened a summer study program for J.D. students in Beijing. The program was originally conducted with the China University of Political Science and Law, and after two years it was changed to Renmin University (People&#x27;s University) in Beijing.

The school also features semester exchange programs with ESADE Faculty of Law in Barcelona, Spain; University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden; Université Jean Moulin (Lyon III) in Lyon, France, Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany; University College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland, Tilburg University Faculty of Law in Tilburg, Netherlands, Bocconi University in Milan, Italy; and Bucerius Law School in Hamburg, Germany. In Fall 2006, the law school announced a new exchange partnership with the Universidad de Montevideo in Montevideo, Uruguay.

==Student life==

===Musical===

An annual highlight for the law school is when the student body puts on its own full-length musical: written, performed, directed and produced by the all-student Theatre of the Relatively Talentless (T.O.R.T.). Begun in 2002, the event draws over a thousand audience members each year and features cameos by distinguished alumni and other distinguished members of the Minnesota legal community. For the 2006 show, &quot;West Bank Story&quot; (a spoof on &quot;West Side Story&quot;), tickets sold out within three days. Previous shows include: &quot;The Wizard of Fritz&quot; (2003); &quot;Law Wars&quot; (2004); &quot;Walter Wonka and the Lawyer Factory&quot; (2005); &quot;West Bank Story&quot; (2006); &quot;Frankenlaw&quot; (2007); &quot;Robin Hood, Esq.&quot; (2008); &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Law School&quot; (2009); &quot;A Midsemester Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2010); &quot;Harry Torter and the Magical Law School&quot; (2011); &quot;Alawddin: The Tale of 1001 All-Nighters&quot; (2012); &quot;Back to the Future Interest&quot; (2013); &quot;Clue: A Murder Mystery in Mondale&quot; (2014); &quot;Froze-In&quot; (2015); &quot;Minnesota Jones and the Law School of Doom&quot; (2016); &quot;The T.O.R.T. Producers&quot; (2017); and &quot;Top Gunner&quot; (2018). T.O.R.T. performed &quot;Tale as Old as Time&quot; March 29 and 30, 2019, at the Pantages Theater in downtown Minneapolis. T.O.R.T.&#x27;s production of &quot;Lord of the Ranks&quot; was cancelled after COVID-19 made a show impossible. In 2021, T.O.R.T.&#x27;s production of &quot;Super Smash Gophers(SSG)&quot; was filmed at the St. Paul Campus Auditorium and screened in Northeast Minneapolis. Participants are known as the TORTfeasors.

===Hockey===
The Fighting Mondales hit the ice during the season in intramural play, club play and rivalry games. In the fall, the Fighting Mondales participate in the University of Minnesota&#x27;s intramural season, often playing their games at Mariucci Arena on the U of M campus. In the spring, the Fighting Mondales square off against the hockey teams of the three other law schools in the Twin Cities (Hamline University School of Law, the University of St. Thomas School of Law, and William Mitchell College of Law) in an annual competition for the coveted Golden Gavel.

==Notable alumni==

The law school has about 13,000 living alumni in 50 states and 70 countries, including 275 serving as federal and state court judges nationwide. Perhaps the most famous alumnus of the law school is former Vice President of the United States and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale (&#x27;56). The law school&#x27;s building was renamed Walter F. Mondale Hall in his honor in 2002. His legacy and continued participation in the life of the school earned him a most interesting honor from the school&#x27;s student-run Law Council: the naming of the mascot of the law school as the &quot;Fighting Mondales.&quot; The Law School held the office of Attorney General of Minnesota uninterrupted from another law school from 1929 until 2007.

<text>The Hudson Brothers were an American musical group formed in Portland, Oregon, consisting of brothers Bill, Brett and Mark Hudson. They were discovered by a record producer while recording music at a local studio, and offered a recording contract. After releasing several garage rock singles in the late 1960s as the New Yorkers, the group began releasing material under the names Everyday Hudson, and Hudson.

They garnered fame as teen idols in the 1970s after their prime-time series debuted as a summer replacement for &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; in 1974. The resulting popularity led to their Saturday-morning half-hour sketch comedy series for CBS, &quot;The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1975. They also released numerous hit singles during this time for producer Bernie Taupin, including &quot;So You Are a Star&quot; (1974), &quot;Rendezvous&quot; (1975), &quot;Lonely School Year&quot; (1975), and &quot;Help Wanted&quot; (1976).

==History==
===1965–1972: Formation and early singles===
The Hudson Brothers had their beginnings as a trio composed of teenage brothers Bill, Mark and Brett Hudson in the early 1960s. The three brothers had been raised in Portland, Oregon, by their Italian American mother who was also a singer and encouraged the boys to play music. Early on, the three brothers had formed a band known as the My Sirs.

After winning several local &quot;battle of the bands&quot;-type contest, the group recorded several songs at a local recording studio, where they received the attention of a local promoter, who offered them a contract promoting Chrysler automobiles. They were subsequently renamed The New Yorkers, after the Chrysler model of the same name. In early 1967, their song &quot;Things Are Changin&#x27;&quot; was issued on a promotional-only 45 for the Chrysler 1967 Go Show (b/w a song by another group, the Fury 4), after which they signed with Scepter. Their first Scepter 45 was issued in the spring of 1967, &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; b/w &quot;You&#x27;re Not My Girl&quot; (SCE-12190) on Scepter Records, which became a radio hit in the Pacific Northwest. This was followed in August 1967 with the single &quot;Seeds of Spring&quot; b/w &quot;Mr. Kirby&quot; (SCE-12199). The B-side was favored by DJs and became a top 10 hit in the Portland area and did well in other regional markets but did not chart nationally. Their final Scepter 45 was &quot;Show Me the Way to Love&quot; b/w &quot;Again&quot; (SCE-12207) in autumn, 1967. To support the singles, the group toured with several popular music acts, such as Buffalo Springfield, The Supremes, Johnny Nash, and The Buckinghams. By October 1968, &quot;The New Yorkers&quot; had switched to Jerry Dennon&#x27;s Pacific Northwest label Jerden Records and issued &quot;Adrianne&quot; (#906), following that up with &quot;Land of Ur&quot; (#908) in March 1969. Later in 1969 The New Yorkers also recorded the Harry Nilsson song &quot;I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City&quot; (#32569) for Decca Records. The Scepter and Jerden recordings, excluding &quot;You&#x27;re Not My Girl&quot; but including the previously unissued &quot;Lazy Meadow,&quot; were included on the 1978 &quot;cash-in&quot; album, &quot;TV&#x27;s The Hudson Brothers&quot;, issued on the First American label. (The New Yorkers, which recorded &quot;Lonely&quot; for Warner Bros. is not the same group.)

On Decca Records they changed their name to Everyday Hudson in early 1970, releasing &quot;Laugh, Funny Funny&quot; (later revived for their 1974 CBS summer replacement series) b/w &quot;Love Is the Word&quot; (#32634). For the release in spring 1971 of &quot;The World Would Be a Little Bit Better&quot; bw &quot;Love Nobody&quot; on Lionel Records (L-3211), their name was shortened to Hudson. They had one further release on Lionel issued only in Canada, &quot;Straight Up and Tall&quot; (an early version of the song they later re-recorded for the Rocket label) b/w &quot;Enough.&quot; This name was also used in 1972 after switching to the newly re-activated Playboy Records, with the release of &quot;Leavin&#x27; It&#x27;s Over&quot; (P-50001), (&quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Chart #110). The single made the top ten in some local markets, including Omaha, where it reached #8. When the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1972, the song was re-titled on the lyrics inside the LP as &quot;Leave and It&#x27;s Over&quot;. It was later reissued when Playboy was acquired by CBS. One further Playboy single was released only in Canada, with &quot;Lovely Lady&quot; as the A-side.

===1972–1979: Teen idols===
One of the group&#x27;s earliest appearances on television as The Hudson Brothers, was in the summer of 1972, for the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; In 1973, the group received the attention of producer Bernie Taupin, who signed them with Elton John&#x27;s record label, The Rocket Record Company. Under the name Hudson, the US Rocket label released &quot;If You Really Need Me&quot; (MCA-40141), which was recorded in France and produced by Taupin and mixed by Andy Scott. The B-side featured two songs, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Fight Back&quot;, and the record was issued in an attractive full-color picture sleeve. In the UK, the same sleeve was used for a different A-side, &quot;Straight Up and Tall,&quot; b/w &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Fight Back&quot;. After the group&#x27;s 1974 success on the Casablanca label, their complete 1973 Rocket LP, &quot;Totally Out of Control,&quot; was issued, and another single was issued, &quot;Be a Man&quot; b/w &quot;Sunday Driver&quot; (MCA-40317), which bubbled under in &quot;Billboard&quot;. The LP did not include &quot;America&quot; or &quot;Fight Back.&quot;
After the group appeared as guests of &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot; on ABC in early 1974, noted producer Chris Bearde was impressed by the brothers&#x27; stage presence and offered them their own variety hour on the CBS network for the summer slot vacated by The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. &quot;The Hudson Brothers Show&quot; aired Wednesday nights on CBS from July 31 to August 28, 1974. The show was so successful that CBS devised &quot;The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show&quot;, which aired on Saturday mornings, from September 7, 1974, to August 30, 1975, in a half-hour format. The group&#x27;s television exposure resulted in the brothers becoming teen idols.

Their first release as The Hudson Brothers came in September 1974 with their single &quot;So You Are a Star&quot; on Casablanca Records (NES 0108), which peaked on the Billboard charts at #21 in November 1974. The group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Totally Out of Control&quot; (1974), was released through The Rocket Record Company, and charted at #179 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in December 1974. Their third studio album, &quot;Hollywood Situation&quot; simultaneously peaked at #174.

They subsequently released the single &quot;Coochie Coochie Coo&quot; (NES 816) in 1975, which peaked on the Bubbling Under Chart at #108. The song was taken from the &quot;Hollywood Situation&quot; LP, but the single version featured added percussion and was backed with the non-LP track, &quot;Me and My Guitar&quot;. They then re-signed with Rocket and scored another hit with &quot;Rendezvous&quot; (#26 U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) from their fourth studio album, &quot;Ba-Fa&quot;. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing one of the group&#x27;s summer shows in 1975, wrote:
&quot;Ba-Fa&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at #176 in January 1976. The follow-up single, &quot;Lonely School Year,&quot; charted in &quot;Billboard&quot; at #60, but their next Rocket single, &quot;Spinning the Wheel (With The Girl You Love),&quot; failed to chart. They then signed with Arista Records in 1976. Their first Arista single, &quot;Help Wanted,&quot; peaked at #70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. It appears that a follow-up single, &quot;She&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; (a remake of the Crystals&#x27; &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot; with the genders switched), was planned for release, as they promoted it on several TV appearances, but the 45 was never released. A second Arista single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Lonely,&quot; failed to chart and was backed with the non-LP track, &quot;Pauline,&quot; which the Hudsons wrote and produced. Their final Arista 45, &quot;The Runaway,&quot; also failed to chart. The three then starred alongside Bob Monkhouse in &quot;Bonkers!&quot;, a half-hour syndicated comedy show in 1978, produced in Britain by ATV (Jack Burns was its American producer) and distributed by ITC. The same year, they each appeared together in the comedy film &quot;Zero to Sixty&quot; (1978).

===1980–1981: Final album and dissolution===
In 1980, the group reverted their name back to &quot;Hudson&quot; after they signed with Elektra Records. (The &quot;Hudsons&quot; which recorded for Columbia in 1983 is not the same group.) They engaged in a promotional tour for their debut Elektra single, &quot;Annie,&quot; but it did not chart, nor did their final Elektra single, &quot;Afraid to Love,&quot; despite featuring a Linda Ronstadt duet vocal which was not credited on the label. The brothers guest-starred on an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1980 (&quot;Not So Fast, Gopher; Haven&#x27;t We Met Before?/Foreign Exchange&quot;). Their final studio album, &quot;Damn Those Kids&quot; (1980), was released by Elektra. In 1983, the three brothers appeared in &quot;Hysterical&quot;, a horror-comedy film.

==Legacy==
Richard Unterberger of AllMusic wrote of the group: &quot;Those that remember the Hudson Brothers usually think of them as a bubblegum act of sorts, due to the fact that they hosted some comedy-variety TV shows in the mid-&#x27;70s. But they were in fact a real group, extremely Anglophile in orientation, with heavy debts to the Beatles and Beach Boys, and occasional hints of the Kinks.&quot;

The long (2:45) introduction to &quot;The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show&quot; was featured in 2021 in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;And Then There&#x27;s Fraud&quot;.

<text>Fundi Konde (August 24, 1924 – June 29, 2000) was a Kenyan musician. He was one of the first popular performers from that country, and was said to be the first electric guitarist from East Africa. His music utilized Swahili lyrics accompanied by a mixture of regional rhythms and imported rumba. His professional career began during World War II, when he performed for East African troops in South Asia. Returning home to Kenya, he made some of the earliest recordings from the region, including the hits &quot;Mama Sowera&quot;, &quot;Majengo Siendi Tena&quot;, &quot;Kipenzi Waniua Ua&quot; and &quot;Jambo Sigara&quot;. He continued to perform and record until 1963, when he retired until the early 1980s, when he began singing, composing and producing again.

He was born in 1924 in Mwabayanyundo village, Kilifi District. He represented the Giriama tribe. He died in 2000 at his home in Kibera, Nairobi.

<text>In a chemistry laboratory, a retort is a device used for distillation or dry distillation of substances. It consists of a spherical vessel with a long downward-pointing neck. The liquid to be distilled is placed in the vessel and heated. The neck acts as a condenser, allowing the vapors to condense and flow along the neck to a collection vessel placed underneath.

In the chemical industry, a retort is an airtight vessel in which substances are heated for a chemical reaction producing gaseous products to be collected in a collection vessel or for further processing. Such industrial-scale retorts are used in shale-oil extraction, in the production of charcoal and in the recovery of mercury in gold-mining processes or from hazardous waste. A process of heating oil shale to produce shale oil, oil shale gas, and spent shale is commonly called retorting. Airtight vessels to apply pressure as well as heat are called autoclaves.

In the food industry, pressure cookers are often referred to as &quot;retorts&quot;, meaning &quot;canning retorts&quot; for sterilization under high temperature (116–130 °C).

==History==
Retorts were widely used by alchemists, and images of retorts appear in many drawings and sketches of their laboratories. Before the advent of modern condensers, retorts were used by many prominent chemists, such as Antoine Lavoisier and Jöns Berzelius.

An early method for producing phosphorus starts by roasting bones, and uses clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic product.

The term &quot;retort&quot; comes by way of Middle French, but ultimately from Latin &quot;retortus&quot;, twisted back, for the shape of the neck.

==Role in analytical chemistry==
In laboratory use, due to advances in technology, especially the invention of the Liebig condenser, retorts were largely considered to have been rendered obsolete as early as the beginning of the 20th century. However, some laboratory techniques that involve simple distillation and do not require sophisticated apparatus may use a retort as a substitute for more complex distillation equipment.

==In biochar-pyrolysis industry==
A retort is a reactor that has the ability to pyrolyze pile-wood, or wood logs over long and up to in diameter.

<text>Cave Stream, also known as Broken River Cave, is a long cave in New Zealand, located on State Highway 73. It is from Arthur&#x27;s Pass and from Christchurch.

It is a popular site for passing tourists, however in spring and during heavy rains it can be dangerous to enter the cave. There have been two deaths in the cave, one due to drowning and one to hypothermia. The cave is easy to explore when the river is low. There is a minor waterfall to climb at the far end, although bolts and chains make this easy to negotiate.

<doc id="1240974" wikidata="Q961236" url="?curid=1240974" title="Swollen Members">
<text>Swollen Members is a four-time JUNO Award-winning Canadian hip hop group from Vancouver, British Columbia, consisting mainly of Madchild and Prevail. Frequent collaborators include vocalist Moka Only (who was actually a member of the group for a short period of time in the mid-1990s when the group was formed, and then again from 2002 to 2005) along with the other former members Easy Roc &amp; Zodak who were only in the group for a few years and producer Rob the Viking, an official group member since 2002. Swollen Members has released nine studio albums, one greatest hits album and 2 compilations, as well as numerous other singles. From 1996 to 2016, Swollen Members were the second best-selling Canadian hip hop artist in Canada (behind Drake) and were the best-selling Canadian hip hop group in Canada.

==History==

===Foundation and single releases===
Swollen Members was founded in 1995 by Vancouverites Madchild (Shane Bunting), Prevail (Kiley Hendriks). Having begun a solo career while living in San Francisco, California, Madchild returned to Vancouver to work. In Vancouver, he met Prevail and Moka Only, who had been working together earlier and joined them. The group had to decide on a name and Moka Only suggested Swollen Members as a joke and it stuck.

The group began testing the international hip-hop waters by releasing four 12-inch vinyl singles on Madchild&#x27;s own indie label Battleaxe Records initially distributed by New York-based Fat Beats; the singles sold approximately 10,000 copies each.

===2001-2002: Second album and mainstream success===
Following &quot;Balance&quot;, Swollen Members recorded and released &quot;Bad Dreams&quot;, released on November 13, 2001, and featuring guests such as Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, Son Doobie, Joey Chavez, and former member Moka Only. It appealed to both underground and mainstream audiences, reaching platinum status in Canada. The album earned Swollen Members their second Juno Award and four MuchMusic Video Awards including best rap video, best director and best independent video.

===2002-2003: &quot;Monsters in the Closet&quot;===
2002&#x27;s &quot;Monsters In the Closet&quot;, their third release, brought official group membership for Moka Only and Rob The Viking to Swollen Members. &quot;Monsters in the Closet&quot; was a collection of B-sides and outtakes along with three new songs, &quot;Breathe&quot; which featured Portuguese Canadian pop singer, Nelly Furtado. Production credits include Evidence from Dilated Peoples. In January 2003, Swollen Members signed with Virgin Records.

===2003-2004: &quot;Heavy&quot;===
In 2003, the band released &quot;Heavy&quot;. In the same year the songs &quot;All Night&quot; and &quot;Deep End (Utah Saints Remix)&quot; were featured in the videogame &quot;SSX3&quot;. In 2004, the Swollen Members song &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; was featured in the video games &quot;WWE Day of Reckoning&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;.

===2005-2006: &quot;Black Magic&quot;===
In 2005, Moka Only decided to break off from the group for a second time and continue work on his solo career. The following year, Swollen Members released their fifth full album, &quot;Black Magic&quot;. It is understood that Madchild and Prevail made an attempt to return to their previously critically acclaimed style and method. Their previous album &quot;Heavy&quot; was unlisted on their official site discography. A single from the album, &quot;Put Me On (feat. Everlast)&quot;, was released in August 2006. Later that year, Nettwerk Management dropped the group due to Madchild&#x27;s affiliation with the Hell&#x27;s Angels.

===2009-2010: &quot;Armed to the Teeth&quot;===
&quot;Armed to the Teeth&quot; was released October 27, 2009 through Kottonmouth Kings label Suburban Noize Records. Featured artists on the album include La Coka Nostra, Talib Kweli, Tech N9ne, Tre Nyce, and a return of Moka Only on the previously released track, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. This release was followed by a North American tour with Australian Hip-Hop group Bliss &#x27;n&#x27; Eso.

===2011-2012: &quot;Dagger Mouth&quot;===
Swollen Members scheduled the release of a studio album, &quot;Dagger Mouth&quot;, for April 2011, under Suburban Noize. Its first single is &quot;Mr. Impossible&quot;. The second single released off &quot;Dagger Mouth&quot; is &quot;Bring Me Down&quot; which features rapper Saigon. A compilation album titled &quot;Monsters 2&quot; was released August 2, 2011.

===2013: &quot;Beautiful Death Machine&quot;===
On March 19, 2013, their ninth studio album, &quot;Beautiful Death Machine&quot; was released, and had debuted at number 3 on the Canadian Albums Chart, making it the group&#x27;s highest charting album in Canada to date.

===2014: &quot;Brand New Day&quot;===
June 17, 2014 brought their tenth studio album &quot;Brand New Day&quot; to store shelves across the world.
In mid-February 2015, Madchild was listed on the &quot;King of the Dot&quot; BO5 card against the battle rapper by the stage name of Daylyt. Footage of his trailer for this event can be found on the KOTD Entertainment channel on YouTube. The footage of the battle can be seen on the KOTD YouTube channel.

===2018: &quot;&quot;Bank Job&quot; + other projects&quot;===
In 2018, the Swollen Members single &quot;Bank Job&quot; was released on all platforms, followed by several solo releases by Madchild and Prevail and Rob the Viking&#x27;s new project XL The Band.
In 2021, Swollen Members released a single and music video for &quot;Tetris&quot; featuring Neph. Since then, Madchild has been focused on solo releases, and Prevail and Rob the Viking have been focused on XL The Band.

<doc id="1240975" wikidata="Q7797453" url="?curid=1240975" title="Three Dog Night (album)">
<text>Three Dog Night (also known as One) is the debut album by American rock band Three Dog Night. The album was originally released by Dunhill Records on October 16, 1968. The album is known for featuring the band&#x27;s Top 5 hit single, their cover of Harry Nilsson&#x27;s song &quot;One&quot;.

The album made the Top 20 on the albums charts in the United States and Canada. It has been reissued multiple times by Dunhill, MCA, and Geffen record labels.

== Background, recording, and production ==
In 1967, Three Dog Night was founded by Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, Chuck Negron, Joe Schermie, Floyd Sneed, Jimmy Greenspoon, and Michael Allsup. The group was a successful live act in Los Angeles and gathered considerable attention by several record labels. After a show at the Troubadour, the group was signed to the Dunhill ABC label, and the band started work on their first studio album.

&quot;Three Dog Night&quot; was recorded at American Recording Company. Producing the sessions was Gabriel Mekler, who had previously worked with Steppenwolf, and was engineered by Richard Podolor – who would later become the band&#x27;s producer – and Bill Cooper.

== Singles and artwork ==
The first single to be released from &quot;Three Dog Night&quot; was &quot;Nobody&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s for You&quot; in November 1968, followed by &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; b/w &quot;Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad&quot; in January 1969. The last single released from the album was &quot;One&quot; b/w &quot;Chest Fever&quot; in April 1969.

The album&#x27;s cover art, designed by Gary Burden, originally only had the name of the group on the front cover. After &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; were released as singles to only moderate success, the band began work on a follow-up album, &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot;. During planning for &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot;&#x27;s release, however, Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron approached Dunhill ABC executives asking that &quot;One&quot; (which Negron sang lead on) be considered as the band&#x27;s next single. The label released &quot;One&quot; as a single in several test markets, and the record quickly became Three Dog Night&#x27;s first bona fide hit, ultimately peaking at #5 on the US charts. The title &quot;One&quot; was added under the group&#x27;s name on the album&#x27;s cover to capitalize on the song&#x27;s popularity.

<doc id="1240979" wikidata="Q2077188" url="?curid=1240979" title="Mark Hudson (musician)">
<text>Mark Jeffery Anthony Hudson (born August 23, 1951) is an American musician, record producer and songwriter based in both Los Angeles and New York City. After first rising to prominence as a performer, songwriter and TV personality in the 1970s as a member of the Hudson Brothers trio, Hudson achieved independent success as record producer and songwriter, working with a broad variety of artists including Cher, Ringo Starr, Aerosmith, Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne, Hanson, Harry Nilsson, and the Baha Men.

==Music==

===With Aerosmith===
Hudson co-wrote the Grammy award-winning Aerosmith hit &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; in 1993, and has since co-written a total of 12 Aerosmith songs. He co-produced their 2001 album &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, co-writing six of the album&#x27;s twelve songs.

Hudson, along with Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Paul Santo, and Marti Frederiksen, make up an informal collective of songwriters, musicians and producers known as the &quot;Boneyard Boys&quot;, considered responsible for Aerosmith&#x27;s creative process.

===With Ringo Starr===
For ten years starting in 1998, Hudson was the primary driving force as producer and composer behind Ringo Starr&#x27;s continued career as a recording artist. In that endeavor, Hudson produced or co-produced nine albums for Starr. There were five studio albums: &quot;Vertical Man&quot; (1998), &quot;I Wanna Be Santa Claus&quot; (1999), &quot;Ringo Rama&quot; (2003), &quot;Choose Love&quot; (2005) and &quot;Liverpool 8&quot; (2008). Three live albums were also released during this relationship: &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; (1998), &quot;Ringo Starr and Friends&quot; (2006) and &quot;Ringo Starr: Live at Soundstage&quot; (2007). The ninth album – a compilation album &quot;Ringo 5.1: The Surround Sound Collection&quot; – included remixes of thirteen tracks originally produced by Hudson and Starr. It was nominated for &quot;Best Surround Sound Album&quot; in the 51st annual Grammy Awards for the year 2007–2008.

The nine albums co-produced by Hudson featured a total of 82 different songs. 17 of the 82 songs were cover versions of various classics and oldies. The other 65 songs were specially composed new songs. Underscoring the primacy of his role in the creation of the albums, Hudson was credited as co-writer of 64 of the 65 new songs.

Hudson secured Steven Tyler as guest vocalist on a remake of Dobie Gray&#x27;s song &quot;Drift Away&quot; for the album &quot;Vertical Man&quot;. Shortly prior to release, Tyler&#x27;s record label demanded that his vocal be removed, and he was replaced by Tom Petty on the officially released album. However, the version of the recording featuring Tyler had been circulated on advance promotional discs and found its way on to bootlegs.

In 2003, Starr told the professional audio industry magazine &quot;Mix&quot;: &quot;Mark puts the fun back in recording. We always have such a great time. He lets the musician know that anything is possible... He&#x27;s a great musician, has lots of energy and he&#x27;s a lot of fun to work with.&quot;

In June 2007, Starr&#x27;s attorney, Bruce Grakal, told &quot;Beatlefan&quot; magazine (issue #141) that the partnership between Hudson and Starr was over, and that they would not work together again. Grakal claimed that the split occurred because Hudson had asked to withdraw from appearing in one of Starr&#x27;s concert tours – allegedly on short notice. Hudson had been offered a major role on a network TV show &quot;The One: Making a Music Star&quot; which conflicted with the Starr tour. Hudson said in an interview with &quot;Beatlefan&quot; magazine that withdrawing from the 2006 All-Starr band tour was not the primary reason for the split and cited Starr&#x27;s preference for using more synthesized sounds for his next album.

Prior to the split with Starr, Hudson had co-written and recorded all 12 songs heard on the final version of the &quot;Liverpool 8&quot; album. After the split, Starr had the tracks remixed by Dave Stewart who was credited as &quot;re-producer.&quot; The album was released in January 2008 on EMI/Capitol Records as part of Starr&#x27;s new recording deal, having left Koch Records in late 2006.

In 2003, Hudson formed a jointly owned record company with Ringo Starr called Pumkinhead Records intended to release recordings by other artists. Distribution for the label was set up via EMI. The label released an album titled &quot;Fake Songs&quot; by Liam Lynch, the creator of MTV&#x27;s sock-puppet show &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot;.

===Producer of multi-star charity single of &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;===
In 2005, Hudson produced a new, multi-artist recording of Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; as a charity single for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Funds raised from the project, which was initiated by Sharon Osbourne, went to the Save the Children charity. Hudson recorded the song in the UK, US and in Europe. Among musicians that Hudson and Osbourne recruited for the recording were: Elton John, Rod Stewart, Steven Tyler, Ozzy Osbourne, Phil Collins, Ringo Starr, Gavin Rossdale, Paul Santo, Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige, Pink, Kelly Osbourne, Katie Melua, Josh Groban, Andrea Bocelli and members of Velvet Revolver: Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dave Kushner and Scott Weiland. The recording also featured actor Robert Downey Jr.

===Other work===
In 1985, he co-starred with Geena Davis in the TV show &quot;Sara&quot;, playing her next-door neighbor Stuart Webber. Hudson also worked closely with Phil Ramone and sang background vocals on many albums/songs produced by Ramone, such as &quot;Crazy for You&quot; by Madonna.

In 1986, he was the in-house bandleader on Fox&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;. Rivers referred to the band as, &quot;Mark Hudson, The Party Boys and The Tramp.&quot;

In July 1994, he joined Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Records as a songwriter and producer for performers such as Alice Cooper and Aerosmith. Disney brought him on board to sharpen production, and identify new acts.

In 2004, he was recruited by Sharon Osbourne to join her team as vocal coach for the UK TV show &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;Weird Beard&quot; because of his colourful facial hair and flamboyant clothing, he coached all the under-25s in the first series and the over-25s in the second.

He also co-wrote 3 tracks on Bon Jovi&#x27;s 2004 box set, &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;.

On March 5, 2006, he achieved his first Number 1 in the UK Top 40 singles chart with an original song he had written for Chico Slimani, &quot;X Factor&quot; contestant. Called &quot;Chico Time&quot;, it displaced Madonna from the top of the chart. It has sold over 100,000 copies in the UK.

&quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; was screened in the UK during the week of May 29, 2006. Hudson was recruited to reprise his coaching role, this time with celebrities who performed in a week long once-a-night version of the show, raising money for their chosen charity. The show was won by Lucy Benjamin, actress; runner up was Matt Stevens, England Rugby International. The British public voted for their favourites as Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh, and Simon Cowell sat in judgment.

At Hudson&#x27;s request, Aerosmith&#x27;s Steven Tyler made a guest appearance on Keith Anderson&#x27;s July 2006 single called &quot;Three Chord Country and American Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, the title track from his debut album. The single was remixed by Hudson in Nashville, and Tyler&#x27;s vocal added at Hudson&#x27;s studio in Los Angeles.

In 2006, Hudson again assumed his coaching role on the 3rd series of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, this time coaching all the acts on a weekly basis.

In early 2007, Hudson was invited to participate for the third year running at Canadian Music Week (CMW). The CMW is the most prestigious event on Canada&#x27;s music industry calendar, showcasing over 500 bands across 40 venues and inviting industry experts to share their knowledge at seminars. Hudson&#x27;s seminar panel included fellow songwriting associates, Nile Rodgers, Glen Ballard, and Don Was. He also took the stage for an evening performance &quot;in-the-round&quot; at the CMW Songwriter&#x27;s Festival 2007.

For the week of July 19, 2007, Hudson was the stand-in DJ on WBIG-FM, a Washington, D.C.–based radio station.

On October 28, 2007, Hudson made his professional solo stage debut in a sold-out, one-man show called &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; at Puck, Doylestown, PA. During the show, Hudson conveyed his experiences with rock music&#x27;s elite using humorous anecdotes, impersonations, and music.

In 2007, he participated as a counselor at both the New York and Las Vegas 10th Anniversary Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp, and, in 2008, at the Los Angeles camp. The camps are an opportunity for non-professional music enthusiasts to perform with professional musicians.

Hudson is currently selling prints of his original artwork as well as a range of other merchandise.

Hudson has been working with AJ McLean, a member of boy-band the Backstreet Boys, on AJ&#x27;s first solo album. Hudson has also written songs with JC Chasez of &#x27;N Sync.

On April 13, 2008, Hudson was asked to perform for US President Bill Clinton at a fundraising rally supporting Hillary Clinton&#x27;s nomination campaign. The performance took place at Puck, Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

In March 2009, he presented a soft launch of his first solo album, titled &quot;The Artist&quot;, at The Fest For Beatles Fans convention in New Jersey, where he also previewed music videos for the songs &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;All The Tea in China&quot;, the latter of which also featured his brother Brett Hudson.

<doc id="1240981" wikidata="Q7992592" url="?curid=1240981" title="When I Was a Boy">
<text>When I Was a Boy is a 1993 album by Jane Siberry. Internationally, it is her most famous album. In Siberry&#x27;s native Canada, however, the album was commercially successful but not as big a hit as her 1985 album &quot;The Speckless Sky&quot;.

The album includes Siberry&#x27;s most famous song, &quot;Calling All Angels&quot;, a duet with k.d. lang which appeared on two movie soundtracks, &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; in 2000. The song was also sung by cast members of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; in a scene from the episode &quot;The Rainbow of Her Reasons.&quot; &quot;Sail Across the Water&quot; and &quot;Temple&quot; were the other singles from the album.

Several songs included electronic textures; &quot;Temple&quot; was Siberry&#x27;s first song that was popular in dance clubs. The album was also Siberry&#x27;s first to explore more spiritual themes, which would become a hallmark of her later music.

On The Tragically Hip&#x27;s 1997 live album &quot;Live Between Us&quot;, Gordon Downie sings the chorus from &quot;Temple&quot; in that album&#x27;s track &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot;.

<text>Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid used to treat certain skin diseases, allergies, and rheumatic disorders among others. It is also used to prevent worsening of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be taken in various ways including by mouth, injection into a muscle, and inhalation.
Common side effects with long-term use include osteoporosis, cataracts, thrush, and muscle weakness. Serious side effects may include psychosis, increased risk of infections, adrenal suppression, and bronchospasm. Use in pregnancy is generally safe. It works by decreasing inflammation and immune system activity.
Triamcinolone was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Triamcinolone is used to treat various medical conditions, such as eczema, alopecia areata, lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, ulcerative colitis, lupus, sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, ocular inflammation, keloids, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, aphthous ulcers (usually as triamcinolone acetonide), central retinal vein occlusion, visualization during vitrectomy and the prevention of asthma attacks.

The derivative triamcinolone acetonide is the active ingredient in various topical skin preparations (cream, lotion, ointment, aerosol spray) designed to treat such skin conditions as rash, inflammation, redness, or intense itching due to eczema and dermatitis.

== Contraindications ==
Contraindications for systemic triamcinolone are similar to those of other corticoids. They include systemic mycoses (fungal infections) and parasitic diseases, as well as eight weeks before and two weeks after application of live vaccines. For long-term treatment, the drug is also contraindicated in people with peptic ulcers, severe osteoporosis, severe myopathy, certain viral infections, glaucoma, and metastasizing tumours.

There are no contraindications for use in emergency medicine.

== Side effects ==

The side effects of triamcinolone are similar to other corticosteroids. In short-term treatment of up to ten days, it has very few adverse effects; however, sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding is seen, as well as acute infections (mainly viral) and impaired glucose tolerance.

Side effects of triamcinolone long-term treatment may include coughing (up to bronchospasms), sinusitis, metabolic syndrome–like symptoms such as high blood sugar and cholesterol, weight gain due to water retention, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as cataract, thrush, osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, and psychosis. Triamcinolone injections can cause bruising and joint swelling. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itch, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing, and anaphylaxis.

== Overdose ==
No acute overdosing of triamcinolone has been described.

== Interactions ==
Drug interactions are mainly pharmacodynamic, that is, they result from other drugs either adding to triamcinolone&#x27;s corticosteroid side effects or working against its desired effects. They include:
* Atropine and other anticholinergics can substantially increase pressure in the eyes.
* Antidiabetic drugs can become less effective because triamcinolone causes diabetes-like symptoms.
* Aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, add to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Diuretics that excrete potassium (such as loop diuretics and thiazides) can increase the risk of hypokalemia and thus lead to abnormal heart rhythm.
* Cardiac glycosides may have more adverse effects due to reduced potassium levels in the blood.
* The risk for blood count changes is increased when combining triamcinolone with ACE inhibitors.

Triamcinolone and other drugs can also influence each other&#x27;s concentrations in the body, amounting to pharmacokinetic interactions such as:
* Rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and other inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 speed up metabolization of triamcinolone and can therefore reduce its effectiveness.
* Conversely, CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, can increase its concentrations in the body and the risk for adverse effects.
* Blood concentrations of ciclosporin can be increased.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===

Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid that is about five times as potent as cortisol but has very few mineralocorticoid effects.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
When taken by mouth, the drug&#x27;s bioavailability is over 90%. It reaches its highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours and is bound to plasma proteins to about 80%. The biological half-life from the plasma is 200 to 300 minutes; due to stable complexes of triamcinolone and its receptor in the intracellular fluid, the total half-life is significantly longer at about 36 hours.

A small fraction of the substance is metabolized to 6-hydroxy- and 20-dihydro-triamcinolone; most of it probably undergoes glucuronidation, and a smaller part sulfation. Three-quarters are excreted via the urine, and the rest via the faeces.

Due to corticoids&#x27; mechanism of action, the effects are delayed as compared to plasma concentrations. Depending on the route of administration and the treated condition, the onset of action can be from two hours up to one or two days after application; and the drug can act much longer than its elimination half-life would suggest.

== Chemistry ==
Triamcinolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyhydrocortisone or 9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone as well as 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.

The substance is a light-sensitive, white to off-white, crystalline powder, or has the form of colourless, matted crystals. It has no odour or is nearly odourless. Information on the melting point varies, partly due to the substance&#x27;s polymorphism: , , or can be found in the literature.

Solubility is 1:500 in water and 1:240 in ethanol; it is slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in chloroform and diethylether, and practically insoluble in dichloromethane. The specific rotation is formula_1 +65° to +72° cm3/dm·g (1% in dimethylformamide).

== Society and culture ==
In 2010, Teva and Perrigo launched the first generic inhalable triamcinolone.

According to Chang et al. (2014), &quot;Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is classified as an S9 glucocorticoid in the 2014 Prohibited List published by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which caused it to be prohibited in international athletic competition when administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly or rectally&quot;.

<doc id="1240997" wikidata="Q6125706" url="?curid=1240997" title="Thomson's lamp">
<text>Thomson&#x27;s lamp is a philosophical puzzle based on infinites. It was devised in 1954 by British philosopher James F. Thomson, who used it to analyze the possibility of a supertask, which is the completion of an infinite number of tasks.

Consider a lamp with a toggle switch. Flicking the switch once turns the lamp on. Another flick will turn the lamp off. Now suppose that there is a being who is able to perform the following task: starting a timer, he turns the lamp on. At the end of one minute, he turns it off. At the end of another half minute, he turns it on again. At the end of another quarter of a minute, he turns it off. At the next eighth of a minute, he turns it on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.

The following question is then considered: Is the lamp on or off at two minutes? Thomson reasoned that this supertask creates a contradiction:

==Mathematical series analogy==

The question is related to the behavior of Grandi&#x27;s series, &quot;i.e.&quot; the divergent infinite series

* &quot;S&quot; = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·

For even values of &quot;n&quot;, the above finite series sums to 1; for odd values, it sums to 0. In other words, as &quot;n&quot; takes the values of each of the non-negative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... in turn, the series generates the sequence {1, 0, 1, 0, ...}, representing the changing state of the lamp. The sequence does not converge as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity, so neither does the infinite series.

Another way of illustrating this problem is to rearrange the series:

* &quot;S&quot; = 1 − (1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · ·)

The unending series in the parentheses is exactly the same as the original series &quot;S&quot;. This means &quot;S&quot; = 1 − &quot;S&quot; which implies &quot;S&quot; = 1⁄2. In fact, this manipulation can be rigorously justified: there are generalized definitions for the sums of series that do assign Grandi&#x27;s series the value 1⁄2.

One of Thomson&#x27;s objectives in his original 1954 paper is to differentiate supertasks from their series analogies. He writes of the lamp and Grandi&#x27;s series,

Later, he claims that even the divergence of a series does not provide information about its supertask: &quot;The impossibility of a super-task does not depend at all on whether some vaguely-felt-to-be-associated arithmetical sequence is convergent or divergent.&quot;

<doc id="1240999" wikidata="Q5738697" url="?curid=1240999" title="Heritage Bowl">
<text>The Heritage Bowl was an NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) bowl game held by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The bowl pitted a team from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) against a team from the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). It was hoped that it would become a true national championship game for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). It was a successor to the Pelican Bowl, which matched MEAC and SWAC teams during the 1970s, and a predecessor to the Celebration Bowl of the 2010s.

==History==
The bowl&#x27;s legitimacy as an HBCU championship game was called into question immediately, starting with its very first contest, when its committee awarded its automatic bid to the MEAC&#x27;s second-seeded co-champion, North Carolina A&amp;T, over its top seed, Delaware State (Delaware State had defeated the Aggies head-to-head, on the road even, but their conference victory over Bethune–Cookman was viewed differently as it had been determined by a forfeit). That first game brought other challenges as well, as it also drew only 7,728 spectators and lost future support from its title sponsor, Alamo, in the process. &quot;That left the organizers $1 million in debt and blaming each other for the bowl&#x27;s problems. President James McKinley, ousted in January, sued Alamo and his board of directors to win back his now largely meaningless post.&quot; The bowl also still owed its participating schools money months after the game.

Heritage Bowl II did not fair all that much better, as it was played without a title sponsor and featured neither the MEAC champion nor the SWAC champion. Even after moving to a January date and having Florida A&amp;M serve as a de facto home team, the game still could only attract 11,273 fans—albeit an improvement over the previous game. In subsequent years half of the conferences&#x27; top seeds declined the automatic bowl bid in order to participate in the NCAA Division I–AA playoffs instead. This became an especially common issue for the MEAC, often leaving its runner-up—or even its third seed, for the final three Heritage Bowls—to represent the conference.

The bowl peaked in the mid-1990s as it found a new stable home (Atlanta&#x27;s Georgia Dome) and a new title sponsor (Jim Walter Homes), all while attendance sharply increased—and the December 30, 1994, game finally got to pair the top-seeded champions from both leagues. This renaissance was short-lived, however, with attendance leveling off as the game evolved into an annual contest between Southern and the MEAC&#x27;s third seed. Because of the MEAC&#x27;s unwillingness to guarantee that its champion would participate, the television contract was ended and eventually the game was too, even though its later attendance figures surpassed some higher-division bowl games. Perhaps not coincidentally, the SWAC—which usually did send its champion, because several of its schools played Thanksgiving weekend regular season games that conflicted with the first round of the playoffs—won most of the Heritage Bowls that were held.

The bowl was played in Miami Gardens, Florida, in 1991, Tallahassee, Florida, in 1993, and Atlanta from 1994 to 1999.

==Legacy==
The game after the 1994 season was the only one to feature both conferences&#x27; top seeds; the games after the 1992 and 1996 seasons did not include either league&#x27;s top seed.

Unlike the Pelican Bowl, which continued to insist that it was an HBCU championship game even after one of the conferences&#x27; top seeds had declined their automatic bid, the Heritage Bowl&#x27;s committee essentially had to concede that its second game could not be promoted as an HBCU championship—since not only one but &quot;both&quot; conferences&#x27; champions had backed out. This largely set the tone for the remainder of the bowl&#x27;s existence, save for the 1994 game. Indeed, playing in the bowl may have actually been viewed as more of a hindrance to earning an HBCU title than by avoiding the game; five teams that declined their Heritage Bowl bids were eventually able to secure black national titles from various selectors any way, without having to determine it head-to-head in the bowl game.

Several Heritage Bowls were in position to have had a major impact on the black national championship selection process. Had Howard not declined its automatic bid to play Southern after the 1993 campaign, for example, it would have likely prevented the HBCU national title from being split between the two schools by selectors. Likewise, in 1996 SWAC top seed Jackson State opted to forgo the bowl for the playoffs, missing an opportunity to avoid a split black national title with Howard by settling it on the field. In both 1997 and 1998 the MEAC&#x27;s top seed, Hampton, refused its invitations to play Southern, likely leading to split titles both years. After Hampton declined the 1998 bid, the MEAC&#x27;s second seed (Florida A&amp;M) did as well; both FAMU and Southern subsequently ended up being declared HBCU champions by various selectors.

In 2010 a replacement for the Heritage Bowl, the &quot;Legacy Bowl&quot;—not to be confused with a later exhibition game of the same name—was proposed for the 2011 season, but MEAC officials voted it down. In 2015 the two conferences finally reached an agreement to compete in the new Celebration Bowl.

==Game results==

Note: an asterisk denotes when the conference&#x27;s outright champion or top-seeded co-champion accepted its automatic bid to the bowl (in 1991 the bowl&#x27;s committee issued the MEAC&#x27;s bid to its second-seeded co-champion)

<doc id="1241000" wikidata="Q2742904" url="?curid=1241000" title="Blue Stinger">
<text>is a 1999 action-adventure game developed by Climax Graphics for the Dreamcast. It was published by Sega in Japan, and by Activision in Western territories as a console launch title. The story follows emergency rescuer Eliot Ballade after he is stranded on the monster-infested Dinosaur Island and allies with fellow survivors and the alien being Nephilim to find the source of the monsters. Gameplay has Eliot navigating Dinosaur Island, fighting monsters using various weapons found or purchased during the game, and finding items to progress to other areas.

Producer and co-writer Shinya Nishigaki was inspired to make &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; as a tribute to Western action movies. Preproduction began in 1996 with a team of eighteen. Notable American staff included Robert Short as monster designer and Pete von Sholly as storyboard artist and camera consultant. The music was composed by Toshihiko Sahashi. The game received mixed reviews from journalists; it was praised for its gameplay and presentation, but several outlets criticized its camera and voice acting. While it sold poorly in Japan, it was successful in North America, going on to sell 500,000 copies worldwide.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Blue Stinger&quot; is an action-adventure game in which players take control of Eliot Ballade or Dogs Bower on Dinosaur Island after it is overrun by monsters. Players explore the game&#x27;s 3D environments to progress the story by unlocking new parts of the island complex. The Japanese version uses fixed third-person camera perspectives similar to the early &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series, while the Western version uses a third-person camera fixed behind the player character and includes an optional first-person mode. In addition to the main mission, there are optional side missions which grant new weapons or items. If the current character loses all health, the player reaches a game over and is sent back to the title screen to reload an earlier save.

Gameplay revolves around Eliot or Dogs−whom the player can switch between once they are together−exploring different areas of the Dinosaur Island complex and finding key items to progress, such as key cards for unlocking doors. The game is made up of eight large environments, which range from outdoor areas such as harbors, to indoor locations such as laboratories and a shopping mall. Some environments include passive hostile elements such as extreme temperatures, with their effects shown using a status bar. Enemies are encountered while exploring and can be fought using weapons, which are either found in the environment or bought from vending machines using money dropped from enemies. Larger enemies and bosses have dedicated health bars. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses; Eliot moves faster, can use multiple weapons, and can swim underwater for a limited time, while Dogs moves slower and can only use one weapon, but can defend himself and uses his fists to fight enemies.

==Synopsis==
Sixty-five million years ago, a meteorite crashes into Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs and paving the way for humans. In 2000, an earthquake sinks the Yucatán Peninsula aside from one island over the meteorite impact area. This island is dubbed &quot;Dinosaur Island&quot;, and international biotech corporation Kimra establishes a research community on it. In 2018, Emergency Sea Evacuation and Rescue member Eliot Ballade is on vacation with his friend Tim off Dinosaur Island when a small meteorite crashes near it, generating a barrier that traps Tim in stasis. A light source emerges from the meteorite and takes the shape and name of Tim&#x27;s good luck boat charm Nephilim, connecting with Eliot before monsters appear and attack the boat, seemingly killing Tim. Eliot escapes with Nephilim to Dinosaur Island, which has become overwhelmed by monsters born from mutated animals and humans. While exploring the island, Eliot is guided by Nephilim, receives information via radio from security team survivor Janine King; and teams up with Dogs Bower, the original discoverer of the island and Janine&#x27;s estranged father.

During their exploration, Eliot learns Kimra had discovered the meteorite was the egg of a hostile alien codenamed &quot;Dinosite&quot;, whose DNA can mutate other lifeforms. During one attack, Eliot swallows some of a mutant&#x27;s vomit and starts to mutate, with Dogs being prepared to mercy kill him if the change is irreversible. Eliot is narrowly cured when the group finds a serum designed to reverse the mutation. Nephilim, who communicates telepathically with Eliot and Janine, is revealed to be the spirit of the second meteorite and an alien which opposes the Dinosite. The three humans allow Nephilim to reunite with her original body, allowing her to kill the original Dinosite while Eliot and Dogs destroy a cloned version which Kimra created during their experiments. Nephilim bids farewell to Eliot, while Tim is revealed to be alive. A post-credits scene shows Nephilim transforming into a Dinosite meteor and launching from a shell which is pursued by more Nephilim meteors.

==Development==
The concept for &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was created by Shinya Nishigaki, a developer who had worked at Enix and later Climax Entertainment. When creating the concept, Nishigaki was inspired by the movies of Steven Spielberg, Akira Kurosawa, John Carpenter and Joe Dante. A specific inspiration was Carpenter&#x27;s movie &quot;The Thing&quot;. He considered &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; a tribute to Western action movies. To develop the game, Nishigaki and several staff from Climax Entertainment&#x27;s CGI division who had worked on &quot;Dark Savior&quot; (1996) formed Climax Graphics as an independent &quot;brother company&quot;. Pre-production of &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; began in September 1996 following completion of &quot;Dark Savior&quot;. Originally in development for the Sega Saturn, &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was rebooted as a Dreamcast title at Sega&#x27;s request. The reworked game&#x27;s design and atmosphere drew additional inspiration from &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Enemy Zero&quot;, and &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. Full production started following the prototype&#x27;s approval by Sega in December 1997. Debugging lasted from late January to early March 1999.

The staff was split between eighteen people at Climax Graphics in Japan, and ten working from North America on the early design and localization. Nishigaki produced the game and co-wrote the script. Other staff included Ayumu Kojima as director, Kazuaki Yokozawa as lead programmer, Ryosuke Murakami as art director, and Masaki Segawa as character designer and co-writer. The game designer was Atsushi Yamamoto. Through American connections from his university years, Nishigaki brought on Robert Short to create the creature designs and 3D models, and noted storyboard artist Pete von Sholly to be camera supervisor. Sholly also handled the game&#x27;s storyboards. The Japanese team worked almost 24 hours a day to complete the game, only taking a few days off during its two years in development.

The game was classified as a cinematic action-adventure game, though Nishigaki wanted to be classed outside traditional game genres. He described one of the game&#x27;s themes as &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;humor&quot;, wanting to set the game apart from the horror-focused titles dominating the Japanese 3D adventure market. The environments were designed to have as few repeated elements as possible, additionally designing the environment to appear lived-in and realistic. The original camera design was directly inspired by his love of movies. Character movements were animated using motion capture. The game engine could not handle two player characters on-screen, though early plans had Dogs tagging along as an AI-driven companion and providing comic relief through environmental interactions. The team also did not have time to make Janine playable.

Nishigaki described the plot as Segawa&#x27;s work, with Nishigaki mostly writing the character banter. Eliot was not written as a conventional lead, being fun-loving and flirtatious in contrast to Dogs&#x27; more traditional stoic attitude. Janine was described as central to the character drama. Commenting on the character and world design, Segawa described Nephilim as a fantastical being compared to the grounded tone of the other characters. The game featured both fully 3D graphics for its environments and character models, and a large number of CGI cutscenes. Nishigaki speculated that Sega&#x27;s support of the project was due to this 3D focus. The lighting was split between three sources; Nephilim, weapon bursts, and pre-set lightmaps. While the Dreamcast was reported to refresh at 60 frames per second, &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was kept to 30 due to the number of creatures shown on screen. They also did not use some of the graphical elements the console was capable of such as bump mapping. During development the team did not know the full specifications of the Dreamcast, with Nishigaki saying they used half the console&#x27;s graphical capacity.

The music was composed by Toshihiko Sahashi, whom Nishigaki wanted to create a Hollywood-style score for the game. The opening and ending themes were recorded using a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Kouji Haishima. Nishigaki wanted the score to emulate the music of John Williams. &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was Sahashi&#x27;s first video game job, treating it like a background movie score. In contrast to his earlier movie and television work, Sahashi had as much time as he wanted to create the score. The opening and ending themes were composed to match the finished movie scenes. Only the opening and ending themes used CD-quality music, with the rest of the game music using the Dreamcast&#x27;s sound chip. Voice acting for all regions was in English, with the Japanese release using subtitles to emulate Hollywood movies. The two leads were voiced by Ryan Drummond and Deem Bristow. The voice recording was directed by Lani Minella, who also voiced Janine. All three at the time were voicing characters from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Nishigaki felt Drummond had done a good job voicing Eliot.

==Release==
&quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was announced at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1998 as part of Sega&#x27;s launch lineup for the Dreamcast in November of that year. It was ultimately delayed into the following year to further polish the title. Nishigaki described Sega as disappointed but understanding that the game missed the Japanese console launch. The game was published in Japan on March 25, 1999, by Sega. Two CDs were released on March 20 of that year through Columbia&#x27;s music label; a soundtrack album, and a single featuring a promotional image song &quot;Sting Me&quot;. A strategy guide, containing both in-game guides and a developer interview, was published by SoftBank Creative on April 27.

The game was shown off at E3 1999, confirming that Activision would serve as the game&#x27;s publisher outside Japan. The partnership came about when Sega approached Activision about Dreamcast support, and Activision expressed interest in &quot;Blue Stinger&quot;. For its Western release, the camera was changed at Activision&#x27;s insistence. Nishigaki disliked the new camera, derisively calling it the &quot;&quot;&quot; system&quot;. A harder difficulty was included for players who cleared the game on hard difficulty, resulting in character costumes changing. Some elements that might either not be understood outside Japan or might have proven offensive were also adjusted for the Western release.

The game was released in North America on September 9, 1999, and in Europe on October 14. It was a console launch title in both regions. An English strategy guide was published by BradyGames on September 14, 1999. A sequel was proposed by Sega, but Nishigaki had moved onto working on the survival horror game &quot;Illbleed&quot;. Plans to port expanded versions of &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; and &quot;Illbleed&quot; to the Xbox by Coolnet Entertainment were shelved following Nishigaki&#x27;s death in 2004; a given reason was the Xbox&#x27;s poor commercial performance in Japan.

==Reception==

&quot;Blue Stinger&quot; sold over 61,000 copies during its opening week in Japan with a sell-through rate of just under 56%. It went on to sell over 111,000 copies in total and become the console&#x27;s 34th best-selling title in the region. While the game sold relatively poorly in Japan, it was commercially successful in North America. During the Dreamcast&#x27;s debut week in the UK, &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was the eighth best-selling title out of the twelve launch titles. The game went on to sell 500,000 copies worldwide, which Sega counted as a success.

The game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings, earning a score of 70% based on 22 reviews. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40. When mentioned, the plot and characters were cited as either enjoyable, or underwhelming. While the gameplay was generally enjoyed, several outlets faulted the puzzle design as obtuse. The camera system in both the Japanese and Western releases met with criticism, though the Western version was seen as less problematic. The real-time and CGI graphics together with monster designs met with overall praise, though the animation was seen as poor. The music met with general praise, but many faulted the voice acting for its poor quality. Several reviewers called the game a showcase for the Dreamcast&#x27;s graphics that lacked compelling gameplay.

Jason D&#x27;Aprile of &quot;Gamecenter&quot; found &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; entertaining but not groundbreaking in its genre, describing it as &quot;fun, interesting, and solid on the whole&quot; despite camera issues holding it back. The reviewers for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found the game generally inferior to game titles that influenced it, with one recommending that players wait for &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; if they wanted a similar but higher quality experience. &quot;Edge&quot; similarly compared the game negatively to the upcoming &quot;Code Veronica&quot;, finding its combination of animation issues and inconsistent audio as &quot;unacceptable&quot; in games of the time. The &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewers were fairly negative about several aspects of its design, with one highlighting its emphasis on graphics over gameplay and characters, feeling it was a lacking launch title. &quot;GameFan&quot; was again negative about the title and called it a weak title in the console&#x27;s launch line-up.

&quot;GamePro&quot; was disappointed with its presentation issues, saying they turned &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; into &quot;a flawed adventure game instead of the sure-fire launch hit that the Dreamcast needs.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Peter Bartholow felt &quot;Blue Stinger&quot; was decent as a game, but lacked polish and depth, saying it would satisfy casual Dreamcast owners more than genre fans. &quot;GameSpy&quot; faulted the short length alongside other problems with its audio and graphic display, but did not think it was a bad game and kept the reviewer&#x27;s interest throughout. Anoop Gantayat, writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, found the game as a whole enjoyable but dedicated much criticism to the camera and voice acting for detracting from the atmosphere. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;Next Generation&quot; highlighted its strong points as the action-based gameplay and graphics rather than its story and tone.

In a feature for &quot;1UP.com&quot; on &quot;Resident Evil&quot; &quot;rip-offs&quot;, Bob Mackey felt the title was lacking elements to make it a true survival horror, and having too great a focus on combat and graphics. Gaming magazine and website &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; felt the title had become mislabelled as survival horror since its release, having enjoyable action gameplay and a strong narrative to engage players. Both highlighted the localization as adding to the game&#x27;s appeal due to its inconsistent quality. In a 2015 retrospective on Nishigaki for &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, John Andersen noted the game&#x27;s advanced graphics for the time, but that the camera changes and poor lip syncing had dated it.

<doc id="1241003" wikidata="Q312847" url="?curid=1241003" title="Thom Mayne">
<text>Thom Mayne (born January 19, 1944) is an American architect. He is based in Los Angeles. In 1972, Mayne helped found the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), where he is a trustee and the coordinator of the Design of Cities postgraduate program. Since then he has held teaching positions at SCI-Arc, the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is principal of Morphosis Architects, an architectural firm based in Culver City, California and New York City, New York. Mayne received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in March 2005.

==Early life and education==
Mayne was born in Waterbury, Connecticut. He studied architecture at the University of Southern California (1968) and also studied at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design in 1978, with a social agenda and urban planning focus, receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree, he began working as an urban planner under Korean-born architect Ki Suh Park. During that time, he recalls that &quot;policy and planning were not going to work for me&quot; and that he &quot;needed a more tangible resolution.&quot; Mayne found himself living on a commune with the grass-roots group Campaign for Economic Democracy, many of whom became his earliest clients.

In 1972, Mayne abruptly left Cal Poly Pomona and collaborated with five other students and educators whom he met at while at USC, to create the Southern California Institute of Architecture, or SCI-Arc. The rift was due to differences between the dean at Cal Poly at the time and Ray Kappe, who headed the school&#x27;s architecture department. The goal of the new institute was to reinvigorate formal architectural education with a keener sense of social conscience. SCI-Arc was &quot;to bring to Los Angeles the critical attitude toward the profession that was being practiced at Cooper Union in New York and the Architectural Association in London.&quot;


==Career==
===Morphosis===
Mayne and some others founded Morphosis Architects in 1972; Michael Rotondi joined in 1975. The firm&#x27;s design philosophy arises from an interest in producing work with a meaning that can be understood by absorbing the culture for which it was made, and their goal was to develop an architecture that would eschew the normal bounds of traditional forms. Beginning as an informal collaboration of designers that survived on non-architectural projects, its first official commission was a school in Pasadena, attended by Mayne&#x27;s son. Publicity from this project led to a number of residential commissions, including the Lawrence Residence. Mayne describes the early days of the group as more of a &quot;garage band&quot; than a practice. They spent their free time experimenting with new inventions for their clients, whom consisted of friends and parents of students.

When work was at a standstill, Mayne took a year off to earn his Master of Architecture degree from Harvard University. He graduated in 1978 and returned to work for Morphosis where he became the principal architect, lead designer and principal in charge for all of Morphosis&#x27; projects. The firm has grown into prominent design practice, with completed projects worldwide. Under the Design Excellence program of the United States government&#x27;s General Service Administration, Thom Mayne has become a primary architect for federal projects. Recent commissions include: graduate housing at the University of Toronto; the San Francisco Federal Building; the University of Cincinnati Student Recreation Center; the Science Center School in Los Angeles, Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona, California; and the Wayne L. Morse United States Courthouse in Eugene, Oregon.

The work of Morphosis has a layered quality. Visually, the firm&#x27;s architecture includes sculptural forms. In recent years, such visual effect has been made possible increasingly through computer design techniques, which simplify the construction of complex forms.

==Controversy==
Early in his career, Mayne became notorious for having an abusive temper, and screaming at clients. &quot;None of my clients would recommend me,&quot; he later admitted.

In late summer 2002, Mayne was asked by &quot;New York&quot; magazine to contribute a proposal for the World Trade Center site, where recovery and cleanup had just ended. In discussing his plan, Mayne told an interviewer his thoughts about the September 11 attacks. &quot;I have no empathy; it doesn&#x27;t make me weep. I could make a better case for justifying the terror than the other way around.&quot;

==Academics==
Mayne taught at the University of Pennsylvania and has held teaching positions at many institutions including Columbia University, Harvard University, Yale University, the Berlage Institute in the Netherlands and the Bartlett School of Architecture in London. He was a tenured faculty member at the UCLA School of Arts and Architecture. In 2013, he contributed a foreword to the book &quot;Never Built Los Angeles&quot; by Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin. Now he is a faculty member at SCI-Arc and UPenn.

==Ray Bradbury house==
In June 2014, Mayne bought the Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles house that noted writer Ray Bradbury had lived in for 50 years. In January 2015, the building was scheduled for demolition which caused a media controversy. According to Mayne, who had not known about the fact that it belonged to Bradbury, the Bradbury family – which has not commented on the situation – had no interest in preserving the house. Mayne further explained that he had bought the house from a foundation that was not associated with the Bradbury estate. A city demolition permit was issued on December 30, 2014 with demolition to take place in January 2015. Materials from Bradbury&#x27;s home office were donated to the Indiana-based Center for Ray Bradbury studies, which intended to raise money to recreate it as it was in the mid-1960s. When queried, the Morphosis office reported that the house was not being razed, but &quot;deconstructed&quot; so that some of the materials could be recycled – including into 451 sets of bookends – a longer and more complicated process. It was reported at the time that a contractor said that the house Mayne intended to build would have three underground levels, including a swimming pool and two stories above ground – although Mayne himself said that plans for the house were not finished. &quot;Our house will not be ordinary – our house is going to be a garden&quot;, and expected it to be a &quot;prototype that is landscape-neutral and water friendly&quot;. The new house was supposed to embody the new ecological and sustainable standard for architecture in Los Angeles, according to Mayne. He further stated that a memorial wall to Bradbury and his works was planned to be part of the project. Construction on the new house was scheduled to finish in 2017.

<text>James Francis Ivory (born Richard Jerome Hazen June 7, 1928) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He was a principal in Merchant Ivory Productions along with Indian film producer Ismail Merchant (his domestic and professional partner) and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The trio is known for making film adaptations of stories by authors such as E.M. Forster and Henry James. Their body of work is celebrated for its elegance, sophistication, literary fidelity, strong performances, complex themes, and rich characters.

Merchant–Ivory was established in 1961 in India where they made modestly budgeted films including &quot;The Householder&quot; (1963), &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965), and &quot;Bombay Talkie&quot; (1970). Ivory began adapting films from classic novels such as &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1979), &quot;Quartet&quot; (1981), &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; (1983), &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984), &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), and &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot; (1990). During this period he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993). At the age of 89, Ivory won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; (2017). 

Over his career, Ivory has earned numerous accolades including an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, and a Writers Guild of America Award as well as nominations for three Golden Globe Awards. He received the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. Ivory released his autobiography &quot;Solid Ivory: Memoirs&quot; (2021) and directed the documentary &quot;A Cooler Climate (2022).

==Early life and education==
James Ivory was born Richard Jerome Hazen on June 7, 1928, in Berkeley, California, and adopted shortly after birth by Hallie Millicent (née de Loney) and Edward Patrick Ivory, a sawmill operator; they renamed him James Francis Ivory. He grew up in Klamath Falls, Oregon. He attended the University of Oregon, where he received a degree in fine arts in 1951. Ivory is a recipient of the Lawrence Medal, UO&#x27;s College of Design&#x27;s highest honor for its graduates. His papers are held by UO Libraries&#x27; Special Collections and University Archives. He was UO&#x27;s 2019-2020 honorary degree recipient.

Ivory then attended the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, where he directed the short film &quot;Four in the Morning&quot; (1953). He wrote, photographed, and produced &quot;Venice: Theme and Variations&quot;, a half-hour documentary submitted as his thesis film for his master&#x27;s degree in cinema. The film was named by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1957 as one of the ten best non-theatrical films of the year. He graduated from USC in 1957.

== Career ==
=== 1959–1978: Beginnings and early films ===

Ivory met producer Ismail Merchant at a screening of Ivory&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Sword and the Flute&quot; in New York City in 1959. In May 1961, Merchant and Ivory formed the film production company Merchant Ivory Productions. Merchant and Ivory became long-term life partners. Their professional and romantic relationship commenced in 1961 and continued until Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005. 

Ivory&#x27;s professional partnership with Merchant has a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the longest partnership in independent cinema history. Before Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005, they produced 40 films, including a number of films that received Academy, BAFTA and Golden Globe awards. Ivory directed 17 theatrical films for Merchant Ivory, and novelist Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was the screenwriter for 22 of their productions in addition to another film produced by Merchant Ivory after Merchant&#x27;s death.

Ismail Merchant once commented: &quot;It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory ... I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American. Someone once described us as a three-headed god. Maybe they should have called us a three-headed monster!&quot;

===1979–1993: Breakthrough and acclaim ===
In 1985, Ivory directed a film adaptation of the classic E. M. Forster novel &quot;A Room with a View&quot;. The film starred Helena Bonham Carter who was 19 years old at the time, in her first major film role. The film also co-starred Julian Sands, Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow, and Daniel Day-Lewis. The film received universal praise with &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, writing: &quot;It is an intellectual film, but intellectual about emotions: It encourages us to think about how we feel, instead of simply acting on our feelings.&quot; The film received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Director for Ivory. He also received Best Director nominations from the British Academy Film Awards, the Golden Globes Awards, and the Directors Guild of America.

The following year Ivory directed another Forster adaptation, the romantic drama &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987). The film is a gay love story in the restrictive and repressed culture of Edwardian England. The story follows its main character, Maurice Hall, through university, a tumultuous relationship, struggling to fit into society, and ultimately being united with his life partner. The film stars James Wilby and Hugh Grant in their first major film appearances, and also features Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Denholm Elliott, Mark Tandy, Billie Whitelaw, Judy Parfitt, Phoebe Nicholls, and Ben Kingsley. In a 2017 retrospective in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Sarah Larson wrote, &quot;...For many gay men coming of age in the eighties and nineties, &quot;Maurice&quot; was revelatory: a first glimpse, onscreen or anywhere, of what love between men could look like&quot;. Director James Ivory has added to the legacy on the film saying, &quot;So many people have come up to me since &quot;Maurice&quot; and pulled me aside and said, &#x27;I just want you to know you changed my life.&#x27;&quot; Ivory won the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Silver Lion for Best Director.

This was followed in 1990 by &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot;, which was adapted by Jhabvala from the novels by Evan S. Connell. According to Ivory, &quot;the world of &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot; is the world I grew up in...It&#x27;s the only film I&#x27;ve ever made that was about my own childhood and adolescence.&quot; The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Joanne Woodward), as well as two New York Film Critics Circle awards. Ivory would later call &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot; a personal favorite, adding that it was the one film he would most like to see reappraised.

In 1992, Merchant-Ivory tackled their third Forster adaptation, &quot;Howards End&quot;, based on the acclaimed novel and starring Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Anthony Hopkins, and Vanessa Redgrave. The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or and went on to critical acclaim. Ivory received his second Academy Award for Best Director nomination. The film also received three Academy Awards for Best Actress (Emma Thompson), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Production Design. The film also received eleven British Academy Film Award nominations, and four Golden Globe Award nominations. In 2016, the film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and was released theatrically after restoration on August 26, 2016.

The following year, Merchant-Ivory directed the period drama &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), adapted from the acclaimed novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro. American filmmaker Mike Nichols served as one of the film&#x27;s producers, and the film reunited Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Supporting performances included James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, and Lena Headey. The film revolved around a dedicated butler who serves an English landlord in the years leading up to the second World War. The film was a commercial and critical success with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, in another favorable review, &quot;Here&#x27;s a film for adults. It&#x27;s also about time to recognize that Mr. Ivory is one of our finest directors, something that critics tend to overlook because most of his films have been literary adaptations.&quot; The film received eight Academy Award nominations with Ivory receiving his third nomination for Best Director. He also received nominations from the British Academy Film Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Directors Guild of America.

In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; the 64th-greatest British film of the 20th century.

=== 1995–2009: Established work ===
In 1995 he directed the film &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot; starring Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson, Thandiwe Newton as Sally Hemings, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Patsy Jefferson. The following year he directed the film &quot;Surviving Picasso&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins as the painter Pablo Picasso. In 1998 he directed and co-wrote the film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot;, a film divided into three segments each named after a different protagonist. In 2000 he directed the romantic period drama &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; which was adapted from the Henry James novel of the same name. He directed the romantic comedy &quot;Le Divorce&quot; starring Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts. 

In 2005 he directed the film &quot;The White Countess&quot; written by Kazuo Ishiguro starring Ralph Fiennes, Natasha Richardson, and Vanessa Redgrave. In 2009, Ivory reunited with Anthony Hopkins for the romantic drama &quot;The City of Your Final Destination&quot; co-starring Laura Linney. The film is the first Merchant Ivory film production without the participation of producer Ismail Merchant due to his death in 2005. 

=== 2017–present: Career resurgence ===
In 2017, Ivory wrote and co-produced the film adaptation of &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;, a 2007 coming-of-age novel by André Aciman. The film, a romantic drama, was directed by Luca Guadagnino and is the final installment in his thematic &quot;Desire&quot; trilogy, following &quot;I Am Love&quot; (2009), and &quot;A Bigger Splash&quot; (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, the story chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio&#x27;s father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archaeology professor.

Ivory originally was to co-direct the film based on Guadagnino&#x27;s suggestion; however, there was no contract to that effect. Ivory accepted the offer to co-direct on the condition that he would also write the film; he spent &quot;about nine months&quot; on the screenplay. Ivory stepped down from a directorial role in 2016, leaving Guadagnino to direct the film alone. According to Ivory, financiers from Memento Films International did not want two directors involved with the project because they &quot;thought it would be awkward ... It might take longer, it would look terrible if we got in fights on the set, and so on.&quot; Guadagnino said Ivory&#x27;s version would have likely been &quot;a much more costly [and] different film&quot; that would have been too expensive to make. Ivory retained the sole credit as screenwriter. The film was the only narrative feature he has written but not directed. Despite stepping aside as director, he continued to remain involved with other aspects of the production.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and garnered huge critical success. Ivory&#x27;s screenplay brought him numerous awards and nominations. Ivory won awards for Best Adapted Screenplay from the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Writers Guild of America, the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards, and the Scripter Awards, among others. Upon winning the Oscar and BAFTA at the age of 89, Ivory became the oldest-ever winner in any category for both awards. 

In 2018, Ivory took part in the film &quot;Dance Again with Me Heywood! &quot;directed by Michele Diomà. At 94 he directed the documentary film, &quot;A Cooler Climate&quot; (2022), about boxes of film footage he shot during a life-changing trip to Afghanistan in 1960, which had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival in 2022. Raymond Ang of &quot;GQ&quot; wrote that the project &quot;might be the most personal&quot; film of his career. In May 2023, an upcoming biographical documentary portrait titled, &quot;James Ivory: In Search of Love and Beauty&quot;, directed by Christopher Manning was announced. The film chronicles the life and work of Ivory and features Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Wes Anderson and others.

==Personal life==
Ivory is gay. His memoir, &quot;Solid Ivory&quot;, gives details of his relationships with his business partner, Ismail Merchant; their composer, Richard Robbins; and others such as Bruce Chatwin. Merchant was Ivory&#x27;s long-term life partner. Their professional and romantic partnership lasted 44 years, from 1961 until Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005. 

Ivory has owned several homes, including the Jacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer House and Mill Complex in Claverack, New York.

==Filmography==
==Awards and honours==

In 1985 &quot;A Room with a View&quot; was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three, for Jhabvala&#x27;s adaptation of Forster&#x27;s novel as well as for Best Costume and Best Production Design. &quot;A Room With a View&quot; was also voted Best Film of the year by the Critic&#x27;s Circle Film Section of Great Britain, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the National Board of Review in the United States and in Italy, where the film won the Donatello Prize for Best Foreign Language Picture and Best Director. In 1987, &quot;Maurice&quot; received a Silver Lion Award for Best Director at the Venice Film Festival as well as Best Film Score for Richard Robbins and Best Actor Awards for co-stars James Wilby and Hugh Grant. 1990&#x27;s &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot; would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Joanne Woodward), as well as Best Actress and Best Screenplay from the New York Film Critics Circle.

In 1992 Ivory directed another film adapted from Forster, &quot;Howards End&quot;. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three: Best Actress (Emma Thompson), Best Screenplay – Adaptation (Ruth Prawer Jhabvala), and Best Art Direction/Set Decoration (Luciana Arrighi/Ian Whittaker). The film also won Best Picture at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards, as well as awards for Best Picture, Best Actress for Emma Thompson and Best Director for Ivory from the National Board of Review. The Directors Guild of America awarded the D.W. Griffith award, its highest honor, to Ivory for his work. At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival the film won the 45th Anniversary Prize. &quot;Howards End&quot; was immediately followed by &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, which was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.

For his work in &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; (2017), Ivory received an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and USC Scripter Award for Best Screenplay. He was also nominated for the AACTA International Award for Best Screenplay, and the Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Screenplay.

<text>The Bluebonnet Bowl was an annual college football bowl game played in Houston, Texas. A civic group was appointed by the Houston Chamber of Commerce Athletics Committee in 1959 to organize the bowl game. It was held at Rice Stadium from 1959 through 1967, and again in 1985 and 1986. The game was played in the Astrodome from 1968 through 1984, as well in 1987. When held in the Astrodome, it was called the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. The proceeds from the bowl games were distributed to various Harris County charitable organizations. The game was discontinued following the 1987 season due to poor ticket sales and lack of a title sponsor.

The Bluebonnet Bowl generally featured a team from Texas against an out-of-state opponent; 19 out of the 29 games involved a team from Texas. From 1980 to 1987, with the exception of 1981, a runner-up from the Southwest Conference played against an at-large opponent. The hometown Houston Cougars played in four games, all before joining the SWC. Runners-up from the Big 8 or Southeastern Conferences were also perennial participants.

The bluebonnet is the state flower of Texas.

Bowl games returned to Houston in 2000 with the Houston Bowl, and then the Texas Bowl since 2006.

<text>Percy V. Pennybacker Jr. (1895–1963) was a Texas civil engineer who pioneered the technology of welded structures, particularly for bridges.

==Professional success==

Pennybacker worked for the Texas Highway Department in the early 1900s designing bridges. He earned his civil engineering degree from the University of Texas at Austin. He served as a captain in the Army Air Service during World War I. After the war, he worked in Kansas and Texas. During World War II, he became interested in welded construction as an alternative to rivets. By promoting the use of welding for heavy stress bridge design, he is credited with saving the state of Texas millions of dollars.

When he retired from the Texas Highway Department, he worked another three years for the city of Austin as a civil engineer.

He was honored as &quot;Outstanding Engineer&quot; by the Texas Society of Professional Engineers, was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and brought the American Welding Society to Austin.

==Childhood==

His father, also Percy V. Pennybacker, and mother Anna (&quot;née&quot; Hardwicke) Pennybacker married in Tyler, Texas in 1884. Percy junior was born in Palestine, Texas and was one of four children. His father, a school superintendent, suffered from diabetes and died of the disease in 1899 while Percy was young. Like his father, Percy too suffered from diabetes. After spending a year in the hospital as a young civil engineer, he became one of the first patients treated with insulin. His mother Anna, an educator and activist wrote and published &quot;A New History of Texas for Schools&quot;, which was adopted by the Texas Legislature for use in public schools from 1898 through 1913. The family moved from Palestine to Austin in 1900.

==Non-professional life==

He married Mary Alice. An Episcopalian, he helped found St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Austin.

==Recognition==

The iconic Pennybacker Bridge (a.k.a. the &quot;360 bridge&quot;) in Austin, Texas is named in his honor.

<doc id="1241026" wikidata="Q4930332" url="?curid=1241026" title="Bluegrass Bowl">
<text>The Bluegrass Bowl was a college football bowl game that was played only once, on December 13, 1958, at Cardinal Stadium (later known as &quot;Old Cardinal Stadium&quot;) in Louisville, Kentucky. The Oklahoma State Cowboys defeated the Florida State Seminoles, 15–6.

==Background of the Bluegrass Bowl==
Game organizers expected the Bluegrass Bowl to be an annual event in Louisville, starting with the 1958 contest. The first choices for the game were the Kentucky Wildcats and the Alabama Crimson Tide, which went 5–4–1 in its first season under Bear Bryant, who had previously coached at Kentucky for eight seasons. The Wildcats, who had received poor treatment from the Louisville crowd during a 51–0 win over at Cardinal Stadium in their season opener, turned down the bid, with the team&#x27;s lettermen voting 18–12 against. Kentucky&#x27;s players voting to turn down bowl bids was nothing new: they said no to the Gator Bowl in 1953, despite a 7–2–1 record in Bryant&#x27;s final season in Lexington, and again in 1954 after going 7–3. Alabama also declined; Oklahoma State and Florida State accepted invitations.

Bowl organizers successfully negotiated a national television contract with American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with a blackout. At the time, ABC held only a secondary affiliation in Louisville with primary CBS affiliate WHAS-TV. A crowd of 15,000, less than half capacity, was expected for the inaugural game. Tickets were priced at $6.50 each, though due to unenthusiastic demand they were being sold for $1.50 on the day of the game. Parking cost 25 cents.

==Game results==
==1958 Bluegrass Bowl==
Oklahoma State entered the game ranked #19 in the AP Poll, while Florida State was unranked. Florida State was an independent with a 7–3 regular season record; Oklahoma State was also 7–3 as an independent, having left the Missouri Valley Conference after the 1956 season and not joining the Big Eight Conference until 1960. Florida State, in their final season under head coach Tom Nugent, made in their third bowl game. Oklahoma State, coached by Cliff Speegle, was appearing in its fourth bowl game.

The game was played at Cardinal Stadium on the grounds of the Kentucky Exposition Center, just behind Freedom Hall, where the 1958 NCAA University Division basketball tournament had been held in March. Kickoff was at 2:00 p.m., with a game time temperature of , and falling. The playing field was icy and slippery, causing the players to forego cleats and wear tennis shoes instead. The cold weather on top of the general indifference to the contest kept the attendance low; crowd estimates were in the 5,000–10,000 range, and many accounts state that just over 7,000 attended.

In the first quarter, Florida State took two drives into Oklahoma State territory but missed 16 and 23-yard field goal attempts.

Early in the second quarter, Oklahoma State halfback Duane Wood ran 17 yards for a score, putting the Cowboys up 7–0. Late in the second quarter, Oklahoma State again drove deep into Florida State territory, but on fourth-and-five, Florida State defender Ron Hinson stripped the ball from Oklahoma State&#x27;s Forrest Campbell just a foot from the goal line.

Florida State fumbled twice in the third quarter. Oklahoma State took the second fumble for a 10-play, 39-yard touchdown drive capped by another Duane Wood touchdown run. Wood then caught a pass for a two-point conversion to give Oklahoma State a 15–0 lead.

Florida State scored a fourth-quarter touchdown without a successful conversion, giving Oklahoma State a 15–6 win.

==Media coverage==
ABC&#x27;s coverage of the otherwise forgettable Bluegrass Bowl was notable for two reasons: it was the last broadcast of Harry Wismer and the first national telecast to feature Howard Cosell. It was also the first-ever national broadcast of a Florida State football game. Due to the cold weather, the press covering the game deserted the windowless press box and all crowded into a single enclosed, heated room with windows for the game.

==Aftermath==
In January 1959, officials stated that paid attendance for the game was 3,152 with $18,132.50 of actual income. The Bluegrass Bowl organizers proclaimed the game a success despite the low attendance and stated that the game would be played again, but it was not. The 1959 edition had been scheduled for December 19, but was canceled on November 29 after Alabama and Kentucky both declined invitations, as they had done for the inaugural edition of the bowl. Alabama played in the 1959 Liberty Bowl, while Kentucky, having finished the season with a losing record, did not play in a bowl game.

<doc id="1241029" wikidata="Q7635543" url="?curid=1241029" title="Suitable for Framing">
<text>Suitable for Framing is the second studio album by American rock band Three Dog Night. The album was released on the Dunhill record label on June 11, 1969 and was the first of two albums released by the band that year.

The album contains the top 20 hit singles &quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;, &quot;Eli&#x27;s Coming&quot;, and &quot;Celebrate&quot;; the latter of which (along with the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright&quot;) featured the Chicago horn section. It is also notable for being the first album by Three Dog Night to include songs written by band members, and for its inclusion of the Elton John / Bernie Taupin song &quot;Lady Samantha,&quot; as the duo of John/Taupin would not become widely known in the United States for another year.

The album reached the top 10 on charts in both The United States and Canada and became certified gold by the RIAA at the end of the year.

== Recording, production, artwork, packaging ==
As with the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot; was recorded at American Recording Company, was produced by Gabriel Mekler (who produced other Dunhill artists including Steppenwolf), and was engineered by Richard Podolor (who would later become the group&#x27;s producer) and Bill Cooper. The band members during the album&#x27;s recording were Danny Hutton (vocals), Chuck Negron (vocals), Cory Wells (vocals), Jimmy Greenspoon (keyboards), Michael Allsup (guitars), Joe Schermie (bass), and Floyd Sneed (drums, percussion). Engineer Richard Podolor also performed as an uncredited guitarist on the album.

The original version of &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot; (Dunhill DS 50058) was released as a vinyl LP record with a gatefold sleeve. The art direction for the original LP sleeve was done by Wayne Kimbell with photography by Ed Caraeff. The album&#x27;s gatefold photo features Three Dog Night wearing greasepaint make-up, and posing with members of the Los Angeles groupie troupe The GTOs.

== Critical reception ==
Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1969, Robert Christgau believed &quot;Suitable for Framing&quot; suffered for the same reasons &quot;Three Dog Night&quot; succeeded:

<doc id="1241031" wikidata="Q5254581" url="?curid=1241031" title="Delta Bowl">
<text>The Delta Bowl was a college football game played at Crump Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. It was the precursor to the now long-standing Liberty Bowl, the current bowl game held in Memphis since 1965 (although starting at Philadelphia in 1959). The Delta Bowl, which took its name from the nearby Mississippi Delta, played games on New Year&#x27;s Day in both 1948 and 1949 before folding. 

The Delta Bowl became known as the bowl that shocked the football world, landing successful, prestigious teams in its inaugural season, out-performing much more prestigious bowls for the 1948 New Year&#x27;s Day game.

Their luck followed them into the second season. Bowl officials signed the University of Tulsa to appear in the 1949 game prior to the start of the season with the expectation that the team would perform well; however, Tulsa &quot;tanked,&quot; starting the year 0–8 and had to be replaced. Bowl officials managed to sign on another team that ended ranked, William &amp; Mary, which ended the season 20th in the AP poll, another fortuitous stroke for bowl officials.

The first president and organizer of the Delta Bowl was Richard Hyde Dewey, living in Memphis, before moving to Decatur, Alabama, several years later. 

At the close of the 1947 football season, Ole Miss was ranked 13th while TCU also had a successful season, both teams surprised by their successes. In fact, the college administrations for both schools had thought their teams would not make it to a bowl game that year before the season started, as there were only 13 bowls. Thus, they happily accepted an invitation to the newly formed Delta Bowl prior to the kick-off of their first games. Surprisingly, both teams surged as the season went on, and the fan bases and coaches reportedly became nervous, knowing they were contractually tied to the upstart new bowl in Memphis, while qualifying for much more prestigious, long-standing bowls. By the end of the season, they were so successful that they made a trip to Memphis to get out of their contracts. 

Administrators from both universities together went to Dewey and pled their case. His response was, &quot;We&#x27;ve already pre-sold most of our bowl tickets months in advance, mostly to small businesses who went out on a limb to support us. And if I were to let you out of your contracts now, the mob in Memphis would string me up&quot;. 

Both teams played in the Delta Bowl that season, 13th-ranked Ole Miss defeating TCU 13-9 on New Year&#x27;s Day 1948 to a packed stadium.

With local favorite Ole Miss in the game, the 1948 Delta Bowl was a near-sellout, with more than 28,000 fans in attendance. But the 1949 game saw a drop down to about 15,000, putting the game into the red financially. Organizers insisted there would be a third game in 1950, but its primary sponsor, AMVETS, pulled its backing, saying the Delta Bowl had been &quot;successful public relations-wise and publicity-wise, but no funds were derived from it.&quot;

<doc id="1241036" wikidata="Q7079607" url="?curid=1241036" title="List of Doom ports">
<text>&quot;Doom&quot; is one of the most widely ported video games. Since the original MS-DOS version, it has been released officially for a number of operating systems, video game consoles, handheld game consoles, and other devices. Some of the ports are replications of the DOS version, while others differ considerably, including modifications to the level designs, monsters and game engine, with some ports offering content not included in the original DOS version. Since the &quot;Doom&quot; engine&#x27;s source code was released to the public in 1997, hundreds of fan-made ports to various hardware have been developed.

==Official ports==
===Personal computers===

====NeXTSTEP====
This was the version that the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, id Software was using a NeXTcube for its graphic-engine development. This version is sluggish on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.

====OS/2====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to OS/2 by an independent contractor, Jim Thomas, who was hired by IBM to port it and &quot;SimCity&quot;. A successful version was demoed in 1994 running in an OS/2 PM window.

====IRIX====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to IRIX during the summer of 1994 by Dave D. Taylor. IRIX &quot;Doom&quot; was originally based on the unreleased MS-DOS version 1.5, though later updates were based on versions 1.6 and 1.8. No effort was made to take advantage of SGI&#x27;s advanced graphics hardware, and like many other ports the game was rendered entirely in software rendering mode.

====Solaris====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to Solaris in late 1994, and was designed to run with game files from &quot;Doom&quot; 1.8. In the readme, the port is credited to &quot;Dave Taylor and the rest of the folks at id Software&quot;. It runs on Solaris 2.4 and later. The distribution contained two versions: one for regular X11, and another for Sun DGA.

====Classic Mac OS/Mac OS X Classic====
&quot;Doom&quot; for Mac was released on November 4, 1994. &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Final Doom&quot; were ported by Lion Entertainment and released by GT Interactive using a Mac OS launcher application to run original PC WADs. The Mac version runs on System 7 through Mac OS 9 and requires a 68040 or PowerPC processor. Although it can run in Classic under Mac OS X on Power Macs, Panther and Tiger cause graphic artifacts due to the later version of Classic having a double-buffered screen. It can also be played under emulation on Intel and Apple silicon Macs with SheepShaver and QEMU. In addition to an adjustable viewport, it supports rendering at low or high resolutions, and allows network play over AppleTalk as well as IPX.

====Linux====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to Linux by id Software programmer Dave Taylor in 1994. The last Linux &quot;Doom&quot; binaries were provided by id Software on October 13, 1996, through the company&#x27;s FTP server.

The source code to the Linux version of &quot;Doom&quot; was released by id Software on December 23, 1997, under a non-profit End user license agreement; it was re-released on October 3, 1999, under the terms of the GPL-2.0-or-later license. However, the source code to the DOS and Windows versions of the game were not released, due to copyright issues concerning the sound library used by original DOS version and id Software having no access to the source code of the Windows port.

====Microsoft Windows====
The first version of &quot;Doom&quot; for Windows was released under the name &quot;Doom 95&quot;, on August 20, 1996. It was compatible with Windows 95 and up, and was able to use WADs from the DOS versions. It also allowed users to set up multiplayer games much easier than in DOS. It was included with &quot;Final Doom&quot;. The port was project-led by Gabe Newell and other later founders of Valve.

On September 26, 2001, &quot;Doom Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released, containing &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Final Doom&quot;. It was re-released on January 1, 2004 with added preview content for &quot;Doom 3&quot;. Some early versions of &quot;Doom 3&quot; included the Collector&#x27;s Edition and a small demon figurine as a bonus. The &quot;BFG Edition&quot; of &quot;Doom 3&quot;, released on October 15, 2012, includes &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; as well as &quot;Doom II&quot;.

On August 3, 2007, &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Final Doom&quot; were released on Steam. This release runs the original DOS versions of the game using DOSBox, a DOS emulator.

====Acorn RISC OS====
&quot;AcornDoom&quot; was released for both the 26 and 32 bit ARM incarnations of RISC OS, by R-Comp Interactive, on February 7, 1998. It was made available in a bundle of three &quot;Doom&quot; games: &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;, as well as the &quot;Maximum Doom&quot; add-on pack, which contains over 3,000 user levels.

===Consoles===
====Sega 32X====
The 32X version of &quot;Doom&quot; was developed and published by Sega and was released on November 21, 1994. It features 17 of the 18 levels from the first two episodes, but none from episode three. This version lacks multiplayer support, does not play in a full screen, and only has the front sprites for the monsters. 10 levels are missing from the original version (twice as many missing levels as any other version of the game). A DOS prompt shows up after the credits roll if the player finishes the game either using cheats or starting from any level other than the first level, locking up the game. Similarly, the secret level cannot be accessed in these scenarios. Due to the lack of the third episode, the BFG 9000 can only be obtained through the use of cheats. Due to poor use of the YM2612 sound chip, this version&#x27;s soundtrack is considered inferior to that of other versions, and many of the sound effects are missing. As with most mid-90s console ports, the levels come from the Atari Jaguar version. This version does not feature the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, or the Spectre. There is a level select option that allows the player to start on any of the first fifteen levels, although there is no way to save the game or settings.

In 1995, the 32X version of the game was given a score of 30 out of 40 by &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;.

====Atari Jaguar====
The Jaguar version was published by Atari and was released on November 28, 1994. This version has more levels than the SNES and 32X versions, and as many levels as the 3DO and GBA versions. id Software had to strip down the port to allow the game to fit on a 2 megabyte cartridge. It features 22 of the PC version&#x27;s 27 levels, though many of them are simplified, plus two new levels (the levels titled &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; and &quot;Hell Keep&quot; are not the same as the PC levels of the same names). Unlike the 32X, SNES, and 3DO versions, this version of the game display occupies the full screen, albeit with an opaque status bar at the bottom. The game runs at a fairly constant and fluid frame-rate. The levels use more complex lighting effects, but have less variation in floor depth and ceiling height. It lacks the Cyberdemon, the Spider Mastermind, and the Spectre. It is compatible with the JagLink 2-console networking device for two players to play deathmatch. The Jaguar version does not have any music during gameplay, but plays the title theme and intermission music with new instruments. Game settings and progress through the levels are saved automatically, and the player can start a new game anywhere up to the last level reached. Instead of having to cycle through the selection of weapons, the player can select a weapon by pressing its corresponding button on the controller&#x27;s number pad.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it four out of five stars and called it &quot;Definitely the best Jaguar title we&#x27;ve seen so far.&quot;

James &quot;Quasar&quot; Haley, one of the developers of the remastered version, confirmed the PC version of the game &quot;Killing Time&quot; was based on the Atari Jaguar version of &quot;Doom&quot; that had previously been worked on by developer Rebecca Heineman.

====Super Nintendo====
The SNES version of &quot;Doom&quot; was developed by Sculptured Software, published by Williams Entertainment, and released on September 1, 1995. The head programmer of the port, Randy Linden, created a new game engine called the Reality engine for the port. The game makes use of the Super FX powered GSU-2 chip (often referred to as the Super FX 2 chip), and was one of the few SNES games to feature a colored cartridge; the game was a red cartridge in the United States. The game was released as a standard gray cartridge in Europe, Australia, and Japan.

The SNES version of &quot;Doom&quot; features all five of the PC version levels that were missing from the Atari Jaguar version, but is missing a different set of five levels instead. Like the Sega 32X version, this version does not include exclusive levels. The levels included resemble the PC levels more so than other ports. This was also the only home console port of &quot;Doom&quot; released in the 1990s to feature all three of the original secret levels and boss levels from the PC version. Like the Sega 32X version, the player&#x27;s heads-up display does not utilize the whole screen, and enemies are only animated from the front, which means that they always face the player. This renders monster infighting impossible, although it is possible for monsters of the same type to damage each other with projectiles. This version of the game lacks both battery back-up saves and a password system, meaning that each episode must be finished from the beginning. Multiplayer was only available if an XBAND modem was used, which included support for two player deathmatch. This version lacks the Spectre enemy (replaced with regular Demon monsters), though it does feature the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind boss monsters that the Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, and 3DO versions lack. In the North American and PAL versions, episode two cannot be played on the &quot;I&#x27;m Too Young to Die&quot; and &quot;Hey, Not Too Rough&quot; difficulties, and episode three can only be played on &quot;Ultra-Violence&quot; and &quot;Nightmare&quot; difficulties if one is selected from the game&#x27;s episode select menu, though it is possible to play episode three on the &quot;Hurt Me Plenty&quot; difficulty if the player beats episode two on that difficulty setting. In the Japanese version, however, all three episodes can be played on any difficulty level.

The automap display takes advantage of the rotating and scaling abilities of the Super FX 2 chip, with the entire map spinning around the player&#x27;s position rather than the player being portrayed with an arrow. In the Japanese version, the player is able to see enemies on the automap, a feature not present in the PC and many other ports of &quot;Doom&quot;. Due to hardware limitations, particles such as blood impacts, smoke, or bullet sparks are not present, and floors and ceilings are not textured. The chaingun is capable of firing a single bullet (although firing once still plays two firing sounds). Moreover, the shotgun does not fire seven individual shots as it does in the PC version, but rather functions like a hunting rifle. This allows the player to shoot (and be shot) from a distance using the shotgun with no decrease in power. This version of &quot;Doom&quot; features support for the SNES Mouse peripheral.

Reviews for the SNES version were mixed. &quot;Super Play&quot; awarded the game a 92% score, calling it &quot;rather excellent&quot; and describing it as a &quot;game they said could never be done” on the SNES. It further described the game as being the &quot;most technically accomplished SNES title yet seen&quot; and described it as &quot;one of the best reasons to own&quot; a SNES. It stated that the game had fine joypad controls, albeit with a touch of &quot;treacley responsiveness&quot; during the most action heavy moments. Nintendo Magazine System awarded it 95% describing the game as &quot;fantastic&quot;. Total! described it as “one of the finest SNES games ever created” awarding it 93%. &quot;GamesMaster (magazine)&quot; described the game as &quot;fabulous&quot; in spite of it moving slower than the other versions, and awarded it 93%, saying that it surpassed the 32X version. &quot;Console +&quot; reviewers described the game as &#x27;excellent&#x27; and awarded it 92%. AHL described it as the best console port of Doom thus far, surpassing the 32X and Jaguar versions. Marc stated that making negative comparisons with the PC version was &#x27;ridiculous&#x27; as a PC costs over 10,000 francs, and in spite of a few small flaws, he would still buy the SNES version with no regrets. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave this version a score of 5.375 out of 10. Two of their reviewers said that it was &quot;decent&quot; but clearly inferior to other versions of &quot;Doom&quot;, while the other two felt it to be a poor game even without comparing it to other versions. They particularly criticized that enemies at a distance are too pixelated to be seen, making it &quot;seem like you are getting hit for no reason at all&quot;. They cited the &quot;outstanding&quot; music as the one strong point. &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly complained that enemies are so pixelated at mid-distance or farther that they blend in with the backgrounds. They also criticized the graphics in general as requiring &quot;constant squinting&quot; to discern what is going on and called the controls &quot;poor and sluggish.&quot; While acknowledging that creating a port of Doom for a last generation console at all was an impressive technical accomplishment, they concluded the port to be not worthwhile and gave it two out of five stars. &quot;GamePro&quot; instead stated that distant objects appear sharp and clear, and that it is objects which are close up which appear extremely pixelated. They gave the SNES version a generally negative assessment, saying that the game is almost unplayable due to the unresponsive controls.

Linden would later develop a cancelled port of &quot;Quake&quot; for the Game Boy Advance as well as the PlayStation emulator Bleem!. On July 14, 2020, Linden released the source code for the port under the GPL-3.0-only license. At QuakeCon 2024, Limited Run Games announced a &quot;new and improved&quot; version of the SNES port of &quot;Doom&quot; developed with the involvement of Linden which boasts performance improvements, the inclusion of the Thy Flesh Consumed episode from &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and circle strafing as well as other additions. The larger 4mb cartridge will feature a new custom chip that exceeds the performance of the previous Super FX chips and the game will support rumble with a new compatible controller that will also be released alongside the game in 2025.

====PlayStation====
The PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot; was published by Williams Entertainment and developed by its San Diego development division, Leland Interactive Media, and released on November 16, 1995. This version spent six months in development. It is one of the best selling versions of the game after the original PC version. It was re-released several times, first on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; range in the U.S., which requires that games have sold at least 150,000 copies there, and on the &quot;Platinum Range&quot; in PAL regions, which indicates that it sold over 600,000 copies in those territories.

Changes from the PC original include the removal of the &quot;Nightmare&quot; difficulty level, and the fact that progress is saved via passwords (given at the end of each level). The passwords also save ammo and health stats, but the numbers for them are rounded. This version features 59 levels in total; 23 levels from the PC version of &quot;Doom&quot; (edited much like the Jaguar and 32X versions), both of the levels designed for the Jaguar version, six new levels designed by the Midway team, five levels from &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;″s fourth episode, and 23 levels from &quot;Doom II&quot;. Unlike the other 1990s &quot;Doom&quot; ports, all of the enemies from the PC version of &quot;Doom&quot; are included. However, the Arch-vile monster from &quot;Doom II&quot; is not present; according to one of the game&#x27;s designers, Harry Teasley, this was because he had twice as many frames as any other monster, and the team felt that they &quot;just couldn&#x27;t do him justice&quot; on the PlayStation. There is, however, one new monster, the Nightmare Spectre. According to Teasley, this was included to add variety, and to take advantage of the PlayStation&#x27;s capabilities. Two player deathmatch and co-operative multiplayer modes are available on the PlayStation if two consoles are linked using the original Serial I/O port, and each console has its own controller and &quot;Doom&quot; disc inserted.

Many textures were reduced in size due to technical limitations. As a result, the mug shot appears to be different from the one in the PC version; in fact, it is the same animated sprite, but squashed in from the sides. A small selection of new graphics and visual effects were introduced. These include sector-based coloured lighting, an animated, flame-filled sky, and a new animation for the player&#x27;s mug shot, which shows the Doomguy&#x27;s head exploding if the player character is gibbed. For the first time, translucent Spectres are drawn without the cascade effect (including the darker-shaded Nightmare Spectres). The original music by Bobby Prince was replaced by a new score by Aubrey Hodges. The sound effects and voice-overs were also completely redone by Hodges, and, in parts of certain levels, echo effects were added. All of the story text is cut, save for the ending and second intermission from &quot;Doom II&quot;, the latter of which appears at the end of &quot;Ultimate Doom&quot; instead.

On October 1, 1996, a port containing levels from &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot; and &quot;Final Doom&quot; was released for the PlayStation under the name &quot;Final Doom&quot;. The PlayStation version of &quot;Final Doom&quot; has thirteen levels from &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;, eleven levels from &quot;TNT: Evilution&quot;, and six levels from &quot;The Plutonia Experiment&quot;. Like the PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Final Doom&quot; uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of &quot;Doom&quot;, support for the PlayStation Mouse peripheral is available for &quot;Final Doom&quot;.

The PlayStation version was met with critical acclaim, with critics concurring it to be by far the best console version of the game to date. Major Mike of &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect score in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and FunFactor), noting that it was not just a straight conversion but a drastically reworked and comprehensive edition with &quot;enough new twists and turns to surprise even the most battle-weary &quot;Doom&quot; player&quot;. He applauded the inclusion of &quot;Doom II&quot;, the added levels, the much smoother graphics when compared to previous console ports, the clear sound effects, the &quot;chilling&quot; music, and the precise controls. A reviewer for &quot;Maximum&quot; found the port&#x27;s most worthwhile aspects to be the huge number of levels, the use of the shoulder buttons for strafing, and the &quot;vastly improved&quot; audio. He scored it 5 out of 5 stars. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the PlayStation version succeeded in &quot;putting previous efforts for 32X, Jaguar, and especially Super Nintendo, to shame&quot; with its high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, responsive control, deathmatch capability, and inclusion of &quot;Doom II&quot; and levels from &quot;Ultimate Doom&quot;. He complained that the walls are &quot;sticky&quot; and that he was feeling burnt out on reviewing ports of &quot;Doom&quot;, and gave it four out of five stars. &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s 1996 overview of PlayStation games raised the score to a perfect five stars. IGN gave it a 7 out of 10, citing the high frame rate, impressive lighting effects, use of the PlayStation Link Cable, and inclusion of &quot;Doom II&quot; content. However, they criticized that the game was becoming old (the review was published a full year after the PlayStation version was released). &quot;GamePro&quot; awarded it Best PlayStation Game of 1995.

====3DO Interactive Multiplayer====
The 3DO version was published by 3DO and developed by Art Data Interactive, with assistance from Logicware, and was released in 1996. It features the same level set as the Atari Jaguar version, as well as the same auto-save feature, but lacks multiplayer modes. This version runs in a small screen at a low frame rate, though it includes the option to shrink the screen size further, which allows the game to run faster and smoother. It lacks some effects found in other versions but has an updated soundtrack that features remixed and original music. The Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind are missing, though the Spectre (which is absent from the Jaguar, SNES, and 32X versions) is included.

The 3DO version was originally a more ambitious project, intended to surpass the PC version, but after it was mired in development hell for two years, programmer Rebecca Heineman was contracted to create a basic port in ten weeks. According to Heineman, the CEO of Art Data Interactive had no idea of how game development worked and assured her that the project was already well underway and just needed some fine tuning. Heineman then found that the CEO of Art Data had grossly underestimated how much work it would actually take to develop the game, boasting about brand new levels, enemies and weapons in the press when all he had was mock-up art assets. Heineman acquired the PC and Jaguar source code for Doom straight from id Software and created a quick-and-dirty conversion. Due to this tight time constraint, porting over the soundtrack was not practical, so the score was re-recorded for the port by the CEO of Art Data Interactive and his band. Full-motion video cutscenes were also planned to take advantage of the 3DO&#x27;s media streaming capabilities and increased CD-ROM storage medium, but these never came to pass. Heineman released some screenshots of the planned FMV cutscenes, but claims they were only stills made to lure investors. In December 2014, the source code for the 3DO version was released to the public under the MIT license.

&quot;Maximum&quot; thoroughly panned this version for its lack of PAL optimization, large borders, choppy frame rate even on the smallest possible screen size, bland color palette, music which is lacking in atmosphere, and load times. They added that the frame rate and slowdown make the game too easy: &quot;When large amounts of monsters arrive to beat the crap out of you, the game slows down to such an extent that you have ages to line up your shots and fire.&quot; With their only praise being for the intuitive and effective control configuration, they gave it one out of five stars. &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;the worst console version of &quot;Doom&quot; so far&quot;, chiefly due to the choppy frame rate.

====Sega Saturn====
Based on the PlayStation version, &quot;Doom&quot; was ported to the Sega Saturn by Rage Software and published by GT Interactive in 1997. Though containing the same levels, enemies, structures, and most of the sounds effects and music from the PlayStation version, this port suffers a number of differences and setbacks; the frame rate is significantly lower, the animation is slower, the echoed sound effects and sector-based lighting are missing, the Spectre and Nightmare Spectre monsters do not have the translucent textures and instead are drawn in see-through sprites of regular Demon enemies, and the animated fiery skyline in certain levels is gone, usually replaced with &quot;Doom II&quot;″s city skyline. The lead programmer on this port, Jim Bagley, later said that he originally programmed a hardware-accelerated engine that would have performed on par with high-end PCs of the time, but id Software disallowed usage of the engine due to texture distortion caused by the rendering process, resulting in the final version using an entirely software-based renderer. John Carmack of id Software explained that they disallowed the engine because &quot;I hated affine texture swim and integral quad verts.&quot;

This version is compatible with the Saturn analog controller and the Saturn mouse. However, the mouse cannot be used to strafe, access the automap, or manually change weapons (though as in all versions of &quot;Doom&quot;, the player character automatically equips a weapon when it is first acquired and switches to a different weapon if the current one is depleted of ammunition).

The packaging for the U.S. release contains a few errors, such as the game screen shots on the back actually being from the PC version of &quot;Final Doom&quot;, and it claims to be &quot;deathmatch ready&quot;, when it is in fact only one player (the deathmatch and cooperative multiplayer modes are only in the Japanese and PAL releases, despite the fact that the Saturn link cable needed to play these modes had not been released in PAL regions).

The Saturn port was met with a generally negative reception, with most reviewers considering it far below the quality of the PlayStation version. The most common criticisms were the low frame rate and lack of certain graphical elements seen in the PlayStation version. Reviewer fatigue with &quot;Doom&quot; ports also continued to play a role; Jeff Gerstmann, rating it a 3.1 out of 10 in &quot;GameSpot&quot;, commented that &quot;If I see one more Doom game released on any platform, I&#x27;m going to hunt down the people responsible and kill them slowly.&quot; &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; awarded the port a score of 56%, with the reviewer describing it as a &quot;breath-takingly bad conversion of a classic game&quot;, judging the game&#x27;s poor performance to be inexcusable considering the Saturn&#x27;s 2D rendering capabilities, and feeling that even the earlier 32X and Jaguar versions played much better, despite being released on less powerful systems. &quot;GamePro&quot; was less outraged, judging that while the Saturn port is clearly inferior to the PC and PlayStation versions, it is enjoyable in absolute terms and &quot;successfully mimics the PlayStation version in most categories - with the crucial exception of speed.&quot;

====Game Boy Advance====
The Game Boy Advance version of &quot;Doom&quot; was developed by David A. Palmer Productions and was released on November 5, 2001, and featured a level set identical to the Jaguar version, as the engine is actually a port of it.

Both GBA ports feature the same multiplayer functionality as the PC version. These were the first ports of &quot;Doom&quot; on a handheld device. Both &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; received a much larger amount of censoring than other ports (monsters bleed green instead of red, and many more disturbing sprites such as corpses impaled on spikes are removed), resulting in a Teen rating from the ESRB.

====Xbox====
Co-developed by id Software and Vicarious Visions and launched on April 4, 2005, the &quot;Doom 3 Limited Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; features ports of &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;, including a two- to four-player split-screen multiplayer mode. The expansion pack &quot;Resurrection of Evil&quot; also contains &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;, as well as &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;.

====Xbox 360====
On September 27, 2006, &quot;Doom&quot; was released for download on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game has all 4 episodes from &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; plus online cooperative and deathmatch modes through Xbox Live. Like the Xbox version, it does not include any of the console-only levels which appeared in earlier ports. Supports 11 screen sizes, and has higher graphics resolution than any earlier console port. Due to a bug, the music plays at a slower speed. This port, programmed by Nerve Software, also credits Vicarious Visions and likely shares code with the Xbox version. There are no cheats in this version of the game.

In 2010, the game was pulled from the Xbox Live Marketplace because Activision, the game&#x27;s publisher, no longer had the rights to maintain the game on the Marketplace, but as of January 20, 2012, it has been republished by Bethesda Softworks, the same company that published the Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;.

Both games are backwards-compatible with the Xbox One and can be purchased from the Xbox Store. They are also downloaded if the disc for &quot;Doom 3: BFG Edition&quot; is inserted into the console in lieu of the pack-in versions of the games included with that title, though the disc is required to play. They were also offered as a preorder incentive for the 2016 reboot.

====PlayStation 3====
&quot;Doom 3 BFG Edition&quot; contains &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;. Later, &quot;Doom Classic Complete&quot; was released on the PlayStation Network which includes &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Master Levels for Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Final Doom&quot;, the last two appearing for the first time in their entirety on a console.

====25th anniversary release====
&quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; were released for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Android and iOS on July 26, 2019, during QuakeCon, in honor of the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

Bethesda received criticism for allegations that it included additional digital rights management in this version, as the initial releases required that users sign into a Bethesda.net account in order to play. Bethesda later stated that this was not intended to be mandatory, but an optional link to receive rewards on the service&#x27;s &quot;Slayers&#x27; Club&quot; program for &quot;Doom&quot;, and that the mandatory login would be removed in a patch. This initial release for Doom 1 and 2 in the 25th anniversary release was also plagued with uneven pixels, incorrect aspect ratios (no option for 4:3), incorrect lighting position, and the music not matching the original DOS release version. On January 9, 2020, Bethesda released an announcement that Doom 1 and 2 will have a patch and update fixing the problems that plagued Doom 1 and 2&#x27;s initial release. Updates including quick saves, support for 60 frames per seconds, 4:3 aspect ratio support, and support for add-ons (such as &quot;Final Doom&quot; and &quot;No rest for the Living&quot;). On March 6, additional updates and patches came out for Doom and 1 and 2 featuring audio improvements, quality of life features and minor performance optimization.

===Other devices===

====iOS====

An official port of &quot;Doom&quot;, under the title &quot;Doom Classic&quot; was released in 2009 for iOS devices. &quot;Doom Classic&quot; iOS is one of the few official ports handled by former Id Software developer John Carmack himself, and is based on the PrBoom source port.

This version of &quot;Doom&quot; has since been replaced by the 25th Anniversary version on the iOS App Store, due to &quot;Doom Classic&quot; not being updated with support for versions of iOS past iOS 11, due to Apple dropping support for 32 bit apps in iOS 10

====Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)====
Doom has been ported to the Raspberry Pi Pico by Graham Sanderson. The gameplay has every single detail found in the original game, and the video output is the authentic 320x200 pixels. The PIO (Programmable Input/Output) of the Pico was used to emulate VGA. The sound effects are in stereo. Multiplayer mode is also supported. (Up to 4 players over an i2c network)

====WebTV/MSN TV====
Official plans to port Doom to the WebTV Plus and EchoStar DishPlayer internet appliances, both utilizing a custom-made enhancement chip called the SOLO that would allow for more advanced graphics capabilities, were made known as early as late 1998 and 1999 respectively. While it only got an official release for DishPlayer units in 1999 alongside a port of the Netshow version of You Don&#x27;t Know Jack and Solitaire, all made to demo the technological capabilities of the WebTV hardware, a port made for original WebTV Plus units that wasn&#x27;t publicly released was discovered by its dedicated hacking scene around August 1998, which could only be downloaded from connecting to an internal WebTV service. The WebTV and DishPlayer ports were likely developed by Prolific Publishing, Inc. Ports for both devices were stripped-down versions of the full game, only containing 4 episodes, most likely due to the fact they were made solely as demos. The ports also made use of the WebTV keyboard for control input.

Because there was no concern to know how the boxes stored information on the hard disks when either port was made known, and in the case of the WebTV Plus port, copies were supposedly subject to being wiped from the hard disks on command from the WebTV service, both the WebTV Plus and DishPlayer ports remained unpreserved for some time. Since then though, there have been a couple attempts to preserve the game and allow it to be playable after the service&#x27;s discontinuation. Recently, unmodified versions of WebTV Plus and DishPlayer Doom, alongside other WebTV games, have since been publicly archived online. From 2014 to 2021, though, both the DishPlayer and WebTV Plus versions of the game were only available to play through a custom WebTV firmware image named &quot;HackTV&quot;, which was done by WebTV hackers MattMan69 and eMac. These efforts did not intend to preserve the ports in their original forms, however, as the WebTV Plus version in particular is known to have modifications to carry the &quot;HackTV&quot; branding on the splash screen.

====Husqvarna Robotic Lawnmower====
&quot;Doom&quot; was officially ported to the Husqvarna Automower NERA in April 2024, playable with the control wheel thanks to the LCD screen. This port was originally developed during the 2023 Winter Dreamhack.

===In &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;===
In &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, the original &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; games are available to play in the Doom Slayer&#x27;s PC in the Fortress of Doom. Both need to be unlocked, the first by collecting all of the in-game cheat codes, and the second one via the password FLYNNTAGGART.

==Third-party source ports==

This is a list of unofficial ports of the engine used to run &quot;Doom&quot;, referred to as source ports, that expand upon the engine&#x27;s capabilities, alter how the game being run is played, or make it compatible with other operating systems. They have received substantial notable coverage.

There are hundreds of source ports known to have existed. The &quot;Doom&quot; engine&#x27;s source code was released to the public on December 23, 1997. Although &quot;Doom&quot; was originally created for DOS, the original source release was for the subsequent Linux version, due to the use of a proprietary sound library in the DOS version. The original purpose of source ports was cross-platform compatibility, but shortly after the release of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code, programmers were correcting old, unaddressed &quot;Doom&quot; bugs and deficiencies in their own source ports, and later on introducing their own modifications to enhance game features and alter gameplay.

The source code was originally released under a proprietary license that prohibited commercial use and did not require programmers to provide the source code for the modifications they released in executable form, but it was later re-released on October 3, 1999, under the GPL-2.0-or-later license after requests from the community.

The following diagram depicts a simplified family tree of Doom source ports (Information may be outdated).
=== Personal computers ===
==== DOSDoom and derivatives ====
DOSDoom is the first &quot;Doom&quot; source port for DOS, launched within a day after the release of the Linux game&#x27;s source code in 1997. It was created by Chi Hoang, who took the original Linux release of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code and ported it back to DOS. It evolved to include several new features, which were previously unseen at the time shortly after the release of the original &quot;Doom&quot; source code, including translucency, high resolution and color rendering, and vertical aiming.

===== Doom Legacy =====
Doom Legacy is a source port originally written as a fork of DOSDoom, introducing mouse-look, jumping, a console, 32-player deathmatch, skins, and, later, native Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X ports. It has also evolved to support many Boom features and 3D acceleration. Later releases include additional features, notably the ability for levels to contain floors directly over floors in December 2000, meaning levels are not required to be strictly 2D from a top-down perspective as they were in the original &quot;Doom&quot; engine games. It has its own scripting language, called Fragglescript.

==== GLDoom ====
One of the first source ports, glDoom was an attempt to bring OpenGL accelerated graphics support to the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, developed by Bruce Lewis. The project was canceled in 1999 after an accident in Lewis&#x27;s home, in which the hard drives storing the project&#x27;s source code crashed, destroying it. Concurrently, backup tapes storing the code were also destroyed. This has been cited by id Software as one of the reasons why it republished the source code under a free license, as it believed that incidents like that could be prevented by requiring developers to share their changes. In April 2010, however, Lewis rediscovered the glDoom sources in one of his deceased friend&#x27;s hard drives.

==== Boom and derivatives ====
Boom was a port for DOS of the &quot;Doom&quot; source code by TeamTNT. Boom fixed numerous software glitches and added numerous other software enhancements into the engine to such a degree that its additions have been incorporated into most modern versions of &quot;Doom&quot; source ports (such as PrBoom+, ZDoom and Doom Legacy). The last update of Boom was released on October 22, 1998. In October 1999, Boom&#x27;s source code was released. Further development of Boom as a source port was continued for DOS as MBF, for Windows as PrBoom, and for Linux as LxDoom. The latter two later merged as PrBoom and also took on many of the MBF features, so PrBoom&#x27;s own successor, PrBoom+, is effectively the modern equivalent of Boom. Modifications of Doom that use Boom are referred to as &quot;Boom-compatible&quot;, however that usually means &quot;PrBoom+&quot; due to further limits being removed in PrBoom+.

===== Eternity Engine =====
The Eternity Engine is a cross-platform source port licensed under the GNU General Public License. It was first released on January 8, 2001, as version 3.29 beta 1. It was originally meant to power a &quot;Doom&quot; total conversion, but after that project went on hiatus (eventually being cancelled in 2006), the engine became the prime focus. The engine is based on Smack My Marine Up (SMMU). It includes such features as scripting, portals, polyobjects, and &quot;Heretic&quot; support.

===== Marine&#x27;s Best Friend =====
Marine&#x27;s Best Friend (MBF) is a DOS-based source port. It is based on Boom, and adds several new features including high resolution graphics, enhanced monster AI, emulation of the pre-release beta versions of &quot;Doom&quot;, and &quot;helpers&quot; that follow and help the player (specifically dogs, to which the name of the engine refers). It was developed by Lee Killough and is no longer updated. Its code was later used as the base of the source port Smack My Marine Up, which in turn was used to construct the Eternity Engine. Some of its code was also adopted in PrBoom. In August 2004, James Haley and Steven McGranahan ported Marine&#x27;s Best Friend to Windows as WinMBF. WinMBF was last updated in January 2005.

===== MBF21 =====
Modder&#x27;s Best Friend (MBF21) is a specification based on Boom and MBF made in 2021, created to address bugs introduced in MBF and expand the engines capabilities while retaining the conservative vanilla feel of Boom/MBF. The name is not only a reference to the year in which it was developed, but also its compatibility level (complevel) for certain source ports that support it.

===== PrBoom =====
PrBoom is a &quot;Doom&quot; source port derived from Linux and Windows ports of Boom and MBF that includes an optional OpenGL renderer, as well as options allowing it to restore the behavior of earlier executables (such as &quot;Doom&quot; version 1.9, Boom, and MBF) in essential ways. A variation named PrBoom+ provides enhanced demo recording and viewing capabilities. PrBoom was used as the engine for id Software&#x27;s official port for the iPhone, &quot;Doom Classic&quot;. The source port was packaged in the Ubuntu Software Center as well as Fedora&#x27;s RPM software repository alongside Freedoom. PrBoom was last updated on November 9, 2008.

Although PrBoom and PrBoom+ are simpler than some other &quot;Doom&quot; source ports, they are often preferred as staying relatively close to the behavior of the original games, and have good demo support. However, some of the bug fixes and behavior changes of other ports may unbalance how levels made for the original games play, giving players certain advantages or disadvantages.

==== Doom Ray Traced ====

On April 1, 2022, &quot;Doom Ray Traced&quot; was released; a PrBoom+ mod with ray-tracing and DLSS functionality.

==== Doomsday Engine and derivatives ====
The Doomsday Engine is a GPLv2-licensed source port (incorporating the former jDoom, jHexen, and jHeretic) that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The source port also supports &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot;. Its hardware-accelerated engine supports 3D models, dynamic lighting, object and movement smoothing, shadows, and other features. It also includes XG line and sector types for editing extensions, as well as a built-in master server games browser (launcher).

===== Vavoom =====
Vavoom is a source port created by merging the &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Heretic&quot;, and &quot;&quot; source trees to create a unified executable. It also features portions of the &quot;Quake&quot; source code (used predominantly for networking and rendering), and was the first source port to support &quot;&quot;. It has been in development since September 1999, and was first released on June 14, 2000. Among its features are a true 3D polygonal engine with colored lighting and software, Direct3D and OpenGL renderers, freelook support, 3D floors, and support for Boom&#x27;s extended attributes. The source port is packaged in the Fedora RPM software repository alongside free installers that grab the shareware levels for all the games used by the engine by default.

==== ZDoom and derivatives ====
ZDoom is a source port launched for Windows on March 6, 1998, and later Linux and macOS. It supports Boom editing extensions plus all of the extensions made in the version of the &quot;Doom&quot; engine used in &quot;Hexen: Beyond Heretic&quot;, as well as several other new features. It also supports other games that share the &quot;Doom&quot; engine. Unlike many other source ports, ZDoom cannot play demos recorded with Vanilla &quot;Doom&quot;, including the intro demos found in the IWAD. The last version of ZDoom, was released in February 2016, and was officially discontinued on January 7, 2017. In the announcement, ZDoom&#x27;s creator, Randi Heit, recommended using QZDoom or GZDoom instead.

===== GZDoom =====
GZDoom is a source port based on ZDoom that extends its feature set to include an OpenGL 3 renderer. It was released on August 30, 2005. GZDoom also boasts 3D floor support compatible with Doom Legacy and Vavoom, 3D model support, 360 degree skyboxes, and other features. Version 2.4.0 was the first version to be officially released on ZDoom.org alongside the release of QZDoom 1.3.0 on March 19, 2017.

===== Skulltag and Zandronum =====

Skulltag was one of the multiplayer-centric &quot;Doom&quot; ports based on (G)ZDoom. It added 32-player multiplayer and different game modes: standard types such as deathmatch and capture the flag, and other modes such as co-operative waves and invasion maps. Skulltag had support for 3D models and high-resolution textures. Skulltag received a final update on November 7, 2010, and was shut down on June 7, 2012.
Skulltag 98e was succeeded by Zandronum, which is made by the same developers after the original creator moved to another project. Zandronum was first released as version 1.0 on August 24, 2012. Zandronum improved support up to 64 players online per server and introduced Last Man Standing and other, more original game modes.

===== ZDaemon =====
ZDaemon is an online multiplayer source port for &quot;Doom&quot;. It is a fork of another source port, &quot;Client/Server Doom&quot; or &quot;csDoom&quot;, the first stable source port to allow playing on the Internet by using client/server network code (from QuakeWorld). With ZDaemon, players create an account and can then easily connect to multiplayer servers with the included server browser (ZDaemon Launcher). The ZDaemon Launcher also features access to the ZDaemon IRC channel through their own client called &quot;ZRC&quot; (ZDaemon Relay Chat). To cut down on impersonation and spoofing, version 1.09 introduced in-game nick authentication, which allows players to use aliases (such as for clan tags), but only when they actually own the nick. ZDaemon also collects statistics from servers that have it enabled, as well as experience points, allowing players to level up as they play, though leveling up does not provide any in-game benefits.

==== Chocolate Doom ====
Chocolate Doom is a source port for Windows, Linux, macOS, AmigaOS 4, MorphOS, and other modern operating systems that is designed to behave as closely as possible to the original DOS executables (&quot;Vanilla Doom&quot;), going so far as to duplicate bugs found in the DOS executables, including bugs that cause the game to crash. This involves more than just leaving existing bugs in the source code. Several bugs present in the DOS version (for example, the sky bug in &quot;Doom II&quot;) were fixed by the time the &quot;Doom&quot; source code was released in 1997, so these bugs were recreated for Chocolate Doom. Other bugs present in Vanilla Doom were dependent on, for example, details of how DOS handles memory, or hardware drivers, which modern operating systems handle much more gracefully; bugs of this sort were carefully replicated where it was safe and useful to do so. In general, saved game files, configuration files, and demo files created by Chocolate should work identically with Vanilla, and vice versa. The first version of Chocolate Doom was released on September 7, 2005.

As Chocolate Doom is designed to behave as closely as possible to the DOS executables, it has no new core features, is not limit removing, does not support any higher screen resolutions, and caps its frame rate to match the 35fps of Vanilla Doom. However, some peripheral features are introduced to help recreate aspects of the original gameplay experience which are not directly part of the Vanilla Doom executables themselves, or simply to make antiquated original features more usable today. For instance, it supports music playback using the standard MIDI interface of the host operating system, but also offers OPL2 and OPL3 emulation, which recreates how the MIDI tracks sounded on the most popular Sound Blaster audio cards available when Doom was released. It also supports sound effect playback via the PC speaker, if one is present, and can emulate the sound of one if not. It provides an emulation mode for codice_1, a DOS mouse TSR that was commonly used with shooters such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D, but was not part of the games themselves. Where Vanilla Doom allows users to take screenshots using the long-obsolete PCX image file format, Chocolate Doom optionally allows screenshots to be saved in the modern PNG format instead.

Chocolate Doom is popular among players who prefer a strictly traditional Doom experience, but also as a test engine for level designers, as Chocolate Doom crashes where Vanilla would crash and presents bugs in the same way as would Vanilla, allowing mapmakers and modders to test their designs for strict backward compatibility; for both gameplay and testing purposes Chocolate Doom obviates the need to run Vanilla Doom under DOS, or a DOS emulator. By default, it simulates the behavior of DOOM.EXE and DOOM2.EXE version 1.9 running under Windows 98 (DOS version 7.1), although it will simulate the executables from &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; or &quot;Final Doom&quot;, as well as versions as early as version 1.666 (the engine version number at which &quot;Doom II&quot; was released) if it detects their respective IWADs, and can also be made to simulate the behaviour of the executables under both DOS 6.22 and DOSBox, for cases where execution on those platforms yields different bug behaviour.

===== Crispy Doom =====

Crispy Doom is a fork of Chocolate Doom, which features limit removal and numerous quality-of-life enhancements, such as increased display resolution and an unlocked framerate. It uses the same game engine as Chocolate Doom, but allows enhancements to be easily toggled on or off in a separate options sub-menu in a manner that preserves core Vanilla gameplay as much as possible. It is popular among players who want a fundamentally traditional &quot;Vanilla-like&quot; Doom experience but who may want a few modern niceties like a higher screen resolution and/or some major bug fixes, while also appealing to players who, for example, engage in speedrunning or otherwise want to compete fairly against those playing Vanilla by making it trivial to disable any salient differences.

==== Other ports ====
Various versions of &quot;Doom&quot; exist for the Amiga computers, one well-known example of which is ADoom.

=== Portable devices ===
==== Nintendo DS ====
A port of PrBoom was written for the Nintendo DS. PWADs and DEH patches are supported, but only by creating a separate file with arguments to load them on startup. Wi-Fi network play is supported when using a PrBoom server set up on a PC.

==== Digita OS ====
DOOMD was a port released for FlashPoint Technology&#x27;s DigitaOS for digital cameras. The port is based directly on the 1997 source code release. Both &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Doom II&quot; IWADs are supported. Custom WADs are supported, but no selection interface has been implemented.

==== iPod ====
A hack allowed 5th generation iPods to run a port of &quot;Doom&quot;. It is also possible to run &quot;Doom&quot; on iPods running Rockbox&#x27;s Rockdoom plugin.

==== Zune and Zune HD ====
Two ports have been released to run on Zune devices using OpenZDK. One for the Zune HD, and the other for third generation Zunes and lower.

==== TI-Nspire Series ====
A source port to the TI-Nspire graphing calculators (specifically the NDless jailbreak software) was created, titled nDoom. It is a direct port of the original &quot;Doom&quot; engine, and as a result supports all IWADs and PWADs that were designed for the original executable. Support for &quot;Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders&quot; and &quot;Hexen&quot; was added.
==== Gmini 400/402/402cc/AV400 ====
aoDOOM was a source port made for some of Archos Gmini devices that runs an embedded version of ArchOpen. It supports all WADs and PWADs, including Doom 1 and Doom 2.

==== Symbian ====
Another port from original CDoom made for DOS machines and c2Doom exclusively ported for Nokia Series 60 version 2 and 3 editions smartphones. Possibly this mod originated from Korea based upon the trailer that had been released on YouTube.

==== Apple Lightning to HDMI adapter ====
In 2025, Doom was ported to the Apple Lightning to HDMI adapter, which was running a firmware vulnerable to the checkm8 exploit.

=== Other ports ===
These &quot;Doom&quot; source ports have the characteristic of running on virtual machines such as the Java Virtual Machine or Adobe Flash while still being based on the &quot;Doom&quot; engine&#x27;s source code. Due to the nature of the latter, some of these ports have opted for using automatic parsing of C code (such as Adobe Alchemy), while others have adopted a major rewrite.

==== HTML5 ====
Freedoom has been ported to the World Wide Web via Emscripten and asm.js under the name &quot;boon&quot;.

==== WebAssembly ====
The original &quot;Doom&quot; sources have been ported to WebAssembly.

==== Java ====
In the past, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to produce a &quot;Doom&quot; source port in Java such as DoomCott or the Stark Engine, which were either abandoned or never gained enough functionality to be properly called source ports. The only active Java &quot;Doom&quot; project as of 2010 is Mocha Doom, a pure Java implementation of &quot;Doom&quot; with features similar to modern &quot;Doom&quot; source ports and direct compatibility with the original game data.

==== C# ====
&quot;Doom&quot; has been re-implemented in C# by the Managed Doom project.

==== &quot;Doom 3&quot; mod ====
A mod was made for &quot;Doom 3&quot; that allows the player to run the original &quot;Doom&quot; using an in-game terminal. The mod, called &quot;Terminal Doom&quot;, is based on the 1997 source code release, and constitutes an experiment on &quot;Doom 3&quot;″s interactive surfaces. All retail and shareware releases of &quot;Doom&quot; are supported by this port.

==== Hewlett-Packard 16700 series Logic Analyzers ====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to HP-UX 10.20 on the PA-RISC platform, and included as an easter egg on HP (later Agilent and now Keysight)&#x27;s&#x27; 16700 family of PA-RISC based logic analyzers.

====Nintendo Wii ====
WiiDoom is a Wii port of Doom using the open source PrBoom engine.

====Honeywell thermostat====
&quot;Doom&quot; was ported to the Honeywell Prestige thermostat. It is controlled with a controller connected to the USB port on the bottom, which was originally intended for software updates.

====HolyC====
&quot;Toom&quot; is a HolyC source port of &quot;Doom&quot; made for TempleOS systems. It features support for the original &quot;Doom&quot; as well as multiple mods and add-ons including its sequel &quot;Doom 2&quot;.

<doc id="1241039" wikidata="Q6760969" url="?curid=1241039" title="Maria (Jane Siberry album)">
<text>Maria is a 1995 album by Canadian singer and songwriter Jane Siberry. It was her first album not to include any musical contributions from longtime collaborators such as Ken Myhr and Rebecca Jenkins.

==Information==
The album ends with &quot;Oh My My,&quot; a 20 minute-plus ode that gathers the themes from the entire album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;[I]n this heap of Siberjazz you realize that everything that has arisen on &quot;Maria&quot; has indeed converged and that you&#x27;ve actually been led on an unforgettable walk in a garden facing fall with a tour guide who&#x27;s sure-footed in her wobbly pace. Awesome.&quot;

&quot;Maria&quot; was her last major label album. In 1996, Siberry started her own independent record label, Sheeba Records, and has released all of her subsequent recordings on that imprint.

==Reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote about &quot;Maria&quot;:
&quot;[H]ot damn, the girl&#x27;s back in the driver&#x27;s seat with &quot;Maria&quot;...This is vintage Siberry: scissor-kicking around the soul&#x27;s messiest spots in search of anything hinting toward redemption... That&#x27;s exactly what this album&#x27;s about: the pull of life. Not specifically the good or the bad or the ugly but just the pull and the subsequent release.&quot;

==Track listing==

<doc id="1241048" wikidata="Q5086255" url="?curid=1241048" title="Charlottetown Festival">
<text>The Charlottetown Festival is a seasonal Canadian musical theatre festival which has run from late May to mid-October every year since 1965.

The Charlottetown Festival is hosted in Confederation Centre of the Arts every year. Named after its host city of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, since its inception in 1965 the festival has showcased Canada&#x27;s longest-running musical, &quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Musical&quot;. It also seeks out and commissions new Canadian musicals, including &quot;Evangeline&quot;, &quot;Emily&quot;, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;, &quot;Stories From The Red Dirt Road&quot;, &quot;On The Road With Dutch Mason&quot;, &quot;Tell Tale Harbour&quot;, &quot;Bittergirl: The Musical&quot;, &quot;Maggie&quot;, and &quot;Rockabye Hamlet&quot;.

&quot;Anne of Green Gables: The Musical&quot; debuted in 1965 and holds the Guinness World Record for longest-running annual musical, being performed every summer up to 2019. The production was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After returning the musical to the stage in 2022, the festival announced that the musical would from then on be staged every second year. The production has also toured to Japan, New York City, and across Canada.

The festival includes a summer musical theatre training program called the Confederation Centre Young Company. The Young Company shows are free to the public and take place at noon outside the Confederation Centre. The shows typically feature Canadian-themed content. In 2011, Indigenous playwright Cathy Elliott wrote and directed &quot;The Talking Stick,&quot; featuring an all-Indigenous cast. The piece was performed for the Prince William and Princess Catherine during their tour of Prince Edward Island in 2011. As a Canada 150 Signature Project, the Young Company toured the country in 2017, presenting the original musical &quot;The Dream Catchers&quot; and working with youth in each city. &quot;The Dream Catchers&quot; was also performed for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2017, during the Confederation Centre&#x27;s presentation of the annual Symons Medal and Lecture in Charlottetown.

Past artistic directors of the festival include Mavor Moore, Alan Lund, Jacques Lemay, Duncan MacIntosh, Anne Allan, and Walter Learning. The current artistic director is Adam Brazier.

<text>Ponce Kiah Marchelle Heloise Cruse Evans (born April 15, 1951 in Waco, Texas), best known by her pen name Heloise, is an American writer, author, and speaker specializing in lifestyle hints, including consumer issues, pets, travel, food, home improvement, and health. Heloise&#x27;s father was in the Air Force, and like many military brats she moved frequently.

Heloise&#x27;s mother, Heloise Bowles (May 4, 1919–December 28, 1977), born in Fort Worth, Texas, started a newspaper column in the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; called &quot;Readers Exchange&quot; in February 1959, later changed to &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; when King Features Syndicate picked up the column and started syndicating it nationwide. Within just a few years, the column appeared in over 600 newspapers worldwide.

Heloise (the daughter) took over the column in 1977 when mother Heloise died of heart disease. She worked with her mother for several years and contributed to the column as Heloise II. It is still one of the most widely syndicated newspaper columns. She is a contributing editor for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; magazine and writes the monthly column &quot;Heloise to the Rescue.&quot; She has written 11 books, hosted a national radio show and is a nationally known speaker. In 1983 an on-line database of &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; became one of the first on-line information products available to the public via the Mattel Aquarius computer system.

Heloise graduated from the Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas (now Texas State University) in 1974 with a double major in Business Administration and Mathematics, and a teacher&#x27;s certificate. She currently resides near San Antonio, Texas.

<doc id="1241055" wikidata="Q2522514" url="?curid=1241055" title="Victor Ninov">
<text>Victor Ninov (; born June 24, 1959) is a Bulgarian physicist and former researcher who worked primarily in creating superheavy elements. He is known for the co-discoveries of elements 110, 111, and 112 (darmstadtium, roentgenium and copernicium, respectively).

Ninov also claimed the creation of elements 116 and 118 (now livermorium and oganesson); however, an investigation conducted by the University of California, Berkeley concluded that he had falsified the evidence. The repercussions of the affair had an impact on the guidelines of conduct for several research institutions.

== Early life ==
Victor Ninov was born in Bulgaria in 1959. He grew up in the capital city of Sofia. In the 1970s, when Ninov was a teenager, he and his family left for West Germany; they bounced around from house to house. Shortly after the move, Victor&#x27;s father went missing; he was found dead six months later in the Bulgarian foothills due to causes unknown.

== Career ==
Victor Ninov attended Technische Universität Darmstadt near Frankfurt, Germany. Here, he distinguished himself as a very capable physicist: he was particularly good at building scientific instruments and coding analysis programs for them.

This landed him a job at the nearby German research center GSI (&quot;Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung&quot;), where he worked on his doctorate and postdoctoral work of creating new elements.

For his expertise, he was given sole control of the computer analysis program. Here, he became a rising star by co-discovering darmstadtium (element 110), roentgenium (element 111), and copernicium (element 112) by smashing ion beams into heavy elements using GSI&#x27;s UNILAC (a type of particle accelerator) and analyzing the debris. Though an investigation later determined that these discoveries of element 110 and 112 included fabricated samples created by Ninov, additional evidence of the experiment was confirmed to be untampered with, rendering his co-discovery legitimate. These discoveries were made with the help of his addition of a gas separator to the particle accelerator to help filter out everything but the heavy elements they were looking for.

He worked at Stanford University for a time. He was hired at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in 1996 as a world class expert for particle accelerator debris sensors, and analysis programs.

== Fraud investigation ==
While working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) Victor Ninov and his team pursued a hypothesis by Robert Smolańczuk, then a visiting fellow from Poland on a Fulbright scholarship, that element 118 could be formed at relatively low energies by smashing 86Kr and 208Pb isotopes together. This hypothesis was dubbed &quot;Robert&#x27;s magic recipe&quot;, and it was highly controversial at the time. Ninov initially doubted the hypothesis he was pursuing; he is quoted as saying, &quot;We didn&#x27;t know how many orders of magnitude he [Smolańczuk] was wrong&quot;.

As in some earlier research projects, Ninov held sole control of the data analysis program (LBNL&#x27;s was called &quot;GOOSY&quot;), and he was the only one on the team who knew how to use it. In 1999, Ninov and his team reported sightings of element 118, almost exactly as in Smolańczuk&#x27;s hypothesis, and a decay chain that also produced element 116. However, other laboratories were unable to reproduce the results.

Eager to prove their discovery, the team double-checked their instruments, and tried again. One more sighting was made by Ninov, but it was dismissed by a colleague, and a full formal investigation was held to find out what had happened. The original element 118 data was independently analysed; in the original binary data, there was no indication of the presence of element 118 or 116. The investigation dragged on for a year, until it was concluded that &quot;Ninov ... intentionally misled his colleagues—and everyone else—by fabricating data&quot;.

Ninov, who had been placed on leave for the investigation, was fired. The rest of Ninov&#x27;s team officially retracted their claims in 2002. There was also an investigation conducted into Ninov&#x27;s previous unsupervised science at GSI; it was found that &quot;two sightings were spuriously created&quot; (one of element 110 and another of element 112). However these false sightings were found amongst a large amount of real data that still supported his co-discoveries of elements 110 and 112. The GSI investigation concluded that the discovery of those elements was legitimate.

The superheavy elements 116 and 118 were eventually discovered and verified in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia from 2000–2002. These elements were named livermorium and oganesson respectively. In 2010, some of the nuclides that were originally claimed as decay products of element 118 were truly synthesized at LBNL; the 2010 observations did not match the claimed 1999 data. Ninov has continued to maintain that he was innocent.

===Impact on the scientific community===
The reports of the investigation came as quite a shock to other scientists, as Ninov had previously been regarded as a very respected physicist. He was so respected that Albert Ghiorso, a physicist who had part in the discovery of 12 elements and a close collaborator of Glenn Seaborg, once called Ninov &quot;a younger version of himself&quot;. In the aftermath of the investigation, it was troubling to many that so many co-authors on LBNL&#x27;s 1999 papers had contributed to a false statement while apparently unaware that it was false. The Ninov affair resulted in stricter guidelines being set for coauthors; these rules &quot;clarify co-authors&#x27; roles and duties&quot; and include &quot;requiring all coauthors to vouch for their contribution to published work&quot;.

The American Physical Society has also called for increased ethical training and oversight at research institutions, and has sponsored several speakers in an effort to make the scientific community more comfortable and resilient to scientific fraud. Reports on the Ninov affair were released around the same time as the final report on the Schön affair, another major incident of data falsification in physics, and this amplified its impact.

==Personal life==
Ninov is retired from physics. For a time, he worked as a professor of physics at the University of the Pacific, but it is said that he now holds an engineering job in California, where he currently lives. His wife, Caroline Cox, a former history professor at University of the Pacific, died in 2014 of cancer. They were married for 23 years. Ninov had helped her finish her book, &quot;Boy Soldiers of the American Revolution&quot;, and it was published posthumously. He is an avid sailor, and pilots a four-seat plane, an Aero Commander.

<doc id="1241056" wikidata="Q5656" url="?curid=1241056" title="Heloise">
<text>Héloïse; c. 1100–01? – 16 May 1163–64?), variously Héloïse d&#x27;Argenteuil or Héloïse du Paraclet, was a French nun, philosopher, writer, scholar, and abbess.

Héloïse was a renowned &quot;woman of letters&quot; and philosopher of love and friendship, as well as an eventual high ranking abbess in the Catholic Church. She achieved approximately the level and political power of a bishop in 1147 when she was granted the rank of prelate nullius.

She is famous in history and popular culture for her love affair and correspondence with the leading medieval logician and theologian Peter Abelard, who became her colleague, collaborator, and husband. She is known for exerting critical intellectual influence upon his work and posing many challenging questions to him such as those in the &quot;Problemata Heloissae&quot;.

Her surviving letters are considered a foundation of French and European literature and primary inspiration for the practice of courtly love. Her erudite and sometimes erotically charged correspondence is the Latin basis for the &quot;bildungsroman&quot; genre and serve alongside Abelard&#x27;s &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot; as a model of the classical epistolary genre. Her influence extends on later writers such as Chrétien de Troyes, Geoffrey Chaucer, Madame de Lafayette, Thomas Aquinas, Choderlos de Laclos, Voltaire, Rousseau, Simone Weil, and Dominique Aury.

She is an important figure in the establishment of women&#x27;s representation in scholarship and is known for her controversial portrayals of gender and marriage which influenced the development of modern feminism.

== Philosophy and legacy==

Héloïse heavily influenced Abelard&#x27;s ethics, theology, and philosophy of love. A scholar of Cicero following in his tradition, Heloise writes of pure friendship and pure unselfish love. Her letters critically develop an ethical philosophy in which intent is centrally placed as critical for determining the moral correctness or &quot;sin&quot; of an action. She claims: &quot;For it is not the deed itself but the intention of the doer that makes the sin. Equity weighs not what is done, but the spirit in which it is done.&quot; This perspective influenced Abelard&#x27;s intention-centered ethics described in his later work &quot;Etica (Scito Te Ipsum)&quot; (c. 1140), and thus serve as a foundation to the development of the deontological ethics of intentionalist ethics in medieval philosophy prior to Aquinas.

She describes her love as &quot;innocent&quot; yet paradoxically &quot;guilty&quot; of having caused a punishment (Abelard&#x27;s castration). She refuses to repent of her so-called sins, insisting that God had punished her only after she was married and had already moved away from so-called &quot;sin&quot;. Her writings emphasize intent as the key to identifying whether an action is sinful/wrong, while insisting that she has always had good intent.

Héloïse wrote critically of marriage, comparing it to contractual prostitution, and describing it as different from &quot;pure love&quot; and devotional friendship such as that she shared with Peter Abelard. In her first letter, she writes that she &quot;preferred love to wedlock, freedom to a bond.&quot; She also states, &quot;Assuredly, whomsoever this concupiscence leads into marriage deserves payment rather than affection; for it is evident that she goes after his wealth and not the man, and is willing to prostitute herself, if she can, to a richer.&quot; Peter Abelard himself reproduces her arguments (citing Heloise) in &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot;. She also writes critically of childbearing and child care and the near impossibility of coexistent scholarship and parenthood. Heloise apparently preferred what she perceived as the honesty of sex work to what she perceived as the hypocrisy of marriage: &quot;If the name of wife seems holier and more impressive, to my ears the name of mistress always sounded sweeter or, if you are not ashamed of it, the name of concubine or whore...God is my witness, if Augustus, who ruled over the whole earth, should have thought me worthy of the honor of marriage and made me ruler of all the world forever, it would have seemed sweeter and more honorable to me to be called your mistress than his empress&quot; (The Latin word she chose now rendered as &quot;whore&quot;, &quot;scortum&quot; (from &quot;scrotum&quot;) is curiously in medieval usage a term for male prostitute or &quot;rent boy&quot;.)

In her later letters, Heloise develops with her husband Abelard an approach for women&#x27;s religious management and female scholarship, insisting that a convent for women be run with rules specifically interpreted for women&#x27;s needs.

Heloise is a significant forerunner of contemporary feminist scholars as one of the first feminine scholars, and the first medieval female scholar, to discuss marriage, child-bearing, and sex work in a critical way.

== Life and historical events ==
=== Background and education ===

Héloïse is variously spelled Helöise, Héloyse, Hélose, Heloisa, Helouisa, Eloise, and Aloysia, among other variations. Her first name is derived from Proto-Germanic &quot;Hailawidis&quot;, &quot;holy wood&quot;, or possibly a feminization of St. Eloi. Her family origin and original surname are unknown but her last name is often rendered as &quot;D&#x27;Argenteuil&quot; based on her childhood home or sometimes &quot;Du Paraclet&quot; based on her mid-life appointment as abbess at the convent of the Paraclete near Troyes, France.

Early in life, Héloïse was recognized as a leading scholar of Latin, Greek and Hebrew hailing from the convent of Argenteuil just outside Paris, where she was educated by nuns until adolescence. She was already renowned for her knowledge of language and writing when she arrived in Paris as a young woman, and had developed a reputation for intelligence and insight. Abélard writes that she was &quot;nominatissima&quot;, &quot;most renowned&quot; for her gift in reading and writing. She wrote poems, plays and hymns, some of which have been lost.

Her family background is largely unknown. She was the ward of her maternal uncle (&quot;avunculus&quot;) Canon Fulbert of Notre Dame and the daughter of a woman named Hersinde, who is sometimes speculated to have been Hersint of Champagne (Lady of Montsoreau and founder of the Fontevraud Abbey) or possibly a lesser known nun called Hersinde at the convent of St. Eloi (from which the name &quot;Heloise&quot; would have been taken).

In her letters she implies she is of a lower social standing than Peter Abélard, who was originally from the lower nobility, though he had rejected knighthood to be a philosopher. Speculation that her mother was Hersinde of Champagne/Fontrevaud and her father Gilbert Garlande contests with Heloise&#x27;s depiction of herself as lower class than Abelard. Hersinde of Champagne was of lower nobility, and the Garlandes were from a higher social echelon than Abelard and served as his patrons. The Hersinde of Champagne theory is further complicated by the fact that Hersinde of Champagne died in 1114 between the ages of 54 and 80, implying that she would have had to have given birth to Heloise between the ages of 35 and 50.

What is known for sure is that her Uncle Fulbert, a canon of Notre Dame collected her to Notre Dame from her childhood home in Argentuil. By her mid teens to early twenties, she was renowned throughout France for her scholarship. While her birth year is disputed, she is traditionally held to be about 15 to 17 when meeting Abelard. By the time she became his student, she was already of high repute herself. As a poetic and highly literate prodigy of female sex familiar with multiple languages, she attracted much attention, including the notice of Peter the Venerable of Cluny, who notes that he became aware of her acclaim when he and she were both young. She soon attracted the romantic interest of celebrity scholar Peter Abelard.

Heloise is said to have gained knowledge in medicine or folk medicine from either Abelard or his kinswoman Denise and gained reputation as a physician in her role as abbess of Paraclete.

=== Meeting Abelard ===

In his autobiographical piece and public letter &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot; (c. 1132?), Abélard tells the story of his relationship with Héloïse, whom he met in 1115, when he taught in the Paris schools of Notre Dame. Abelard describes their relationship as beginning with a premeditated seduction, but Heloise contests this perspective adamantly in her replies. (It is sometimes speculated that Abelard may have presented the relationship as fully of his responsibility in order to justify his later punishment and withdrawal to religion and/or in order to spare Heloise&#x27;s reputation as an abbess and woman of God.) Heloise contrastingly in the early love letters depicts herself as the initiator, having sought Abelard herself among the thousands of men in Notre Dame and chosen him alone as her friend and lover.

In his letters, Abelard praises Heloise as extremely intelligent and just passably pretty, drawing attention to her academic status rather than framing her as a sex object: &quot;She is not bad in the face, but her copious writings are second to none.&quot; He emphasizes that he sought her out specifically due to her literacy and learning, which was unheard of in most un-cloistered women of his era.

It is unclear how old Héloïse was at the time they became acquainted. During the twelfth century in France, the typical age at which a young person would begin attending university was between the ages of 12 to 15. As a young female, Heloise would have been forbidden from fraternizing with the male students or officially attending university at Notre Dame. With university education offered only to males, and convent education at this age reserved only for nuns, this age would have been a natural time for her uncle Fulbert to arrange for special instruction. 
Heloise is described by Abelard as an &quot;adolescentula &quot;(young girl). Based on this description, she is typically assumed to be between fifteen and seventeen years old upon meeting him and thus born in 1100–01. There is a tradition that she died at the same age as did Abelard (63) in 1163 or 1164. The term adolescent, however, is vague, and no primary source of her year of birth has been located. Recently, as part of a contemporary investigation into Heloise&#x27;s identity and prominence, Constant Mews has suggested that she may have been so old as her early twenties (and thus born around 1090) when she met Abelard. The main support for his opinion, however, is a debatable interpretation of a letter of Peter the Venerable (born 1092) in which he writes to Héloïse that he remembers that she was famous when he was still a young man. Constant Mews assumes he must have been talking about an older woman given his respect for her, but this is speculation. It is just as likely that a female adolescent prodigy amongst male university students in Paris could have attracted great renown and (especially retrospective) praise. It is at least clear that she had gained this renown and some level of respect before Abelard came onto the scene.

=== Romantic liaison ===
In lieu of university studies, Canon Fulbert arranged for Heloise&#x27;s private tutoring with Peter Abelard, who was then a leading philosopher in Western Europe and the most popular secular canon scholar (professor) of Notre Dame. Abelard was coincidentally looking for lodgings at this point. A deal was made—Abelard would teach and discipline Heloise in place of paying rent.

Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until Héloïse became pregnant. Abelard moved Héloïse away from Fulbert and sent her to his own sister, Denise, in Brittany, where Héloïse gave birth to a boy, whom she called Astrolabe (which is also the name of a navigational device that is used to determine a position on Earth by charting the position of the stars).

Abelard agreed to marry Héloïse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Abélard&#x27;s career. Heloise insisted on a secret marriage due to her fears of marriage injuring Abelard&#x27;s career. Likely, Abelard had recently joined Religious Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church was beginning to forbid marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy (to the point of a papal order re-affirming this idea in 1123), public marriage would have been a potential bar to Abelard&#x27;s advancement in the church. Héloïse was initially reluctant to agree to any marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard. Héloïse returned from Brittany, and the couple was secretly married in Paris. As part of the bargain, she continued to live in her uncle&#x27;s house.

===Tragic turn of events===

Fulbert immediately went back on his word and began to spread the news of the marriage. Héloïse attempted to deny this, arousing his wrath and abuse. Abelard rescued her by sending her to the convent at Argenteuil, where she had been brought up. Héloïse dressed as a nun and shared the life of the nuns, though she was not veiled. Fulbert, infuriated that Heloise had been taken from his house and possibly believing that Abelard had disposed of her at Argenteuil in order to be rid of her, arranged for a band of men to break into Abelard&#x27;s room one night and castrate him. In legal retribution for this vigilante attack, members of the band were punished, and Fulbert, scorned by the public, took temporary leave of his canon duties (he does not appear again in the Paris cartularies for several years).

After castration, filled with shame at his situation, Abélard became a monk in the Abbey of St Denis in Paris. At the convent in Argenteuil, Héloïse took the veil. She quoted dramatically from Cornelia&#x27;s speech in Lucan&#x27;s Pharsalia: &quot;Why did I marry you and bring about your fall? Now...see me gladly pay.&quot;

It is commonly portrayed that Abelard forced Heloise into the convent due to jealousy. Yet, as her husband was entering the monastery, she had few other options at the time, beyond perhaps returning to the care of her betrayer Fulbert, leaving Paris again to stay with Abelard&#x27;s family in rural Brittany outside Nantes, or divorcing and remarrying (most likely to a non-intellectual, as canon scholars were increasingly expected to be celibate). Entering religious orders was a common career shift or retirement option in twelfth century France. Her appointment as a nun, then prioress, and then abbess was her only opportunity for an academic career as a woman in 12th century France, her only hope to maintain cultural influence, and her only opportunity to stay in touch with or benefit Abelard. Examined in a societal context, her decision to follow Abelard into religion upon his direction, despite an initial lack of vocation, is less shocking.

=== Astrolabe, son of Abelard and Heloise ===
Shortly after the birth of their child, Astrolabe, Heloise and Abelard were both cloistered. Their son was thus brought up by Abelard&#x27;s sister (&quot;soror&quot;), Denise, at Abelard&#x27;s childhood home in Le Pallet. His name derives from the astrolabe, a Persian astronomical instrument said to elegantly model the universe and which was popularized in France by Adelard. He is mentioned in Abelard&#x27;s poem to his son, the Carmen Astralabium, and by Abelard&#x27;s protector, Peter the Venerable of Cluny, who wrote to Héloise: &quot;I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake&quot;.

&#x27;Petrus Astralabius&#x27; is recorded at the Cathedral of Nantes in 1150, and the same name appears again later at the Cistercian abbey at Hauterive in what is now Switzerland. Given the extreme eccentricity of the name, it is almost certain these references refer to the same person. Astrolabe is recorded as dying in the Paraclete necrology on 29 or 30 October, year unknown, appearing as &quot;Petrus Astralabius magistri nostri Petri filius&quot; (Peter Astrolabe, son of our magister [master] Peter).

=== Later life ===
Heloise rose in the church, first achieving the level of prioress of Argenteuil. At the disbandment of Argenteuil and seizure by the monks of St Dennis under Abbot Suger, Heloise was transferred to the Paraclete, where Abelard had stationed himself during a period of hermitage. (He had dedicated his chapel to the Paraclete, the holy spirit, because he &quot;had come there as a fugitive and, in the depths of my despair, was granted some comfort by the grace of God&quot;.) They now rededicated it as a convent, and Abelard moved on to St. Gildas in Brittany where he became abbot. Heloise became prioress and then abbess of the Paraclete, finally achieving the level of prelate nullius (roughly equivalent to bishop). Her properties and daughter-houses (including the convents of &quot;Sainte-Madeleine-de-Traîne&quot; (c. 1142), &quot;La Pommeray&quot; (c. 1147-51?), &quot;Laval&quot; (ca. 1153), &quot;Noëfort&quot; (before 1157), &quot;Sainte-Flavit&quot; (before 1157), &quot;Boran&quot; / &quot;Sainte-Martin-aux-Nonnettes&quot; (by 1163)) extended across France, and she was known as a formidable businesswoman.

== Correspondence ==
===Exchange with Abelard===

The primary correspondence existing today consists of seven letters (numbered &quot;Epistolae&quot; 2–8 in Latin volumes, since the &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot; precedes them as &quot;Epistola&quot; 1). Four of the letters (&quot;Epistolae&quot; 2–5) are known as the &#x27;Personal Letters&#x27;, and contain personal correspondence. The remaining three (&quot;Epistolae&quot; 6–8) are known as the &#x27;Letters of Direction&#x27;. An earlier set of 113 letters discovered much more recently (in the early 1970s) is vouched to also belong to Abelard and Heloise by historian and Abelard scholar Constant Mews.

Correspondence began between the two former lovers after the events described in the last section. Héloïse responded, both on the behalf of the Paraclete and herself. In letters which followed, Héloïse expressed dismay at problems that Abelard faced, but scolded him for years of silence following the attack, since Abelard was still wed to Héloïse.

Thus began a correspondence both passionate and erudite. Héloïse encouraged Abelard in his philosophical work, and he dedicated his profession of faith to her. Abelard insisted that his love for her had consisted of lust, and that their relationship was a sin against God. He then recommended her to turn her attention toward Jesus Christ who is the source of true love, and to consecrate herself fully from then on to her religious vocation.

At this point the tenor of the letters changes. In the &#x27;Letters of Direction&#x27;, Héloïse writes the fifth letter, declaring that she will no longer write of the hurt that Abelard has caused her. The sixth is a long letter by Abelard in response to Héloïse&#x27;s first question in the fifth letter about the origin of nuns. In the long final, seventh letter, Abelard provides a rule for the nuns at the Oratory of the Paraclete, again as requested by Héloïse at the outset of the fifth letter.

The &quot;Problemata Heloissae&quot; (&quot;Héloïse&#x27;s Problems&quot;) is a letter from Héloïse to Abélard containing 42 questions about difficult passages in scripture, interspersed with Abelard&#x27;s answers to the questions, probably written at the time when she was abbess at the Paraclete.
=== Lost love letters rediscovered ===
Post 1974, Ewald Konsgen suggested and Constant Mews and others have argued that an anonymous series of letters, the &quot;Epistolae Duorum Amantium&quot;, were in fact written by Héloïse and Abelard during their initial romance (and, thus, before the later and more broadly known series of letters). These letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by Héloïse, and thus open several new directions for further scholarship.

However, because the second set of letters is anonymous, and attribution &quot;is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence,&quot; their authorship is still a subject of debate and discussion.

== Influence on literature ==

Héloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational &quot;monument&quot; of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the Bildungsroman and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as Chretien de Troyes, Madame de Lafayette, Choderlos de Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury.

=== Early development of the myth ===

* Jean de Meun, the first translator of Héloïse&#x27;s work, is also the first person, in around 1290, to quote, in the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; (verses 8729 to 8802), the myth of Héloïse and Abelard, which must have meant that her work was sufficiently popular in order for the readership to understand the allusion.
* In around 1337, Petrarch acquired a copy of the Correspondence, which already included the &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot; (translated by Jean de Meun). Petrarch added many notes to the manuscrit before starting to compose in the following year a Chansonnier dedicated to Laure de Sade.
* The Breton lament song (Gwerz) titled &quot;Loiza ac Abalard&quot; sings of the ancient druidess picking &#x27;golden grass&#x27; with the features of a sorceress-alchemist known as Héloïse. This spread a popular tradition, perhaps originating in Rhuys, Brittany, and going as far as Naples. This text and its later tradition associated magic with rationalism, which remained an important component of Abelardian theology as it was perceived until the twentieth century.
* In 1583, the Abbey of Paraclet, heavily damaged during the Wars of Religion, was deserted by its monastic residents who disagreed with the Huguenot sympathies of their mother superior. The Abbess Marie de la Rochefoucauld, named by Louis XIII to the position in 1599 in spite of opposition from Pope Clement VIII, set to work on restoring the prestige of the establishment and organised the cult of Héloïse and Abelard.

=== Early modern period ===

* Following a first Latin edition, that of Duchesne dated to 1616, the Comte de Bussy Rabutin, as part of his epistolary correspondence with his cousin the marquise de Sévigné, sent her a very partial and unfaithful translation on 12 April 1687, a text which would be included in the posthumous collected works of the writer.
* Alexander Pope, inspired by the English translation that the poet John Hughes made using the translation by Bussy Rabutin, brought the myth back into fashion when he published in 1717 the famous tragic poem &quot;Eloisa to Abelard&quot;, which was intended as a pastiche, but does not relate to the authentic letters. The original text was neglected and only the characters and the plot were used.
* Twenty years later, Pierre-François Godard produced a French verse version of Bussy Rabutin&#x27;s text.
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau drew on the reinvented figure in order to write &quot;Julie ou la Nouvelle Héloïse&quot;, which his editor published in 1761 under the title &quot;Lettres des deux amans&quot;.
* In 1763, Charles-Pierre Colardeau loosely translated the version of the story imagined by Pope, which depicted Héloïse as a recluse writing to Abelard, and spread the sentimental version of the legend over the continent.
* An edition designed by André-Charles Cailleau and produced by the heiress of André Duchesne further spread amongst reading audiences a collection of these re-imaginings of the figure of Héloïse.

=== Romantic period ===

* At the very beginning of the romantic period, in 1807, a neo-Gothic monument was constructed for Héloïse and Abelard and was transferred to the Cimetière de l&#x27;Est in Paris in 1817.
* In 1836, A. Creuzé de Lesser, the former Préfet of Montpellier, provided a translation of &#x27;LI poèmes de la vie et des malheurs d&#x27;Eloïse et Aballard&#x27; which was published alongside his translation of the &#x27;Romances du Cid&#x27;
* In 1836, the scholar Victor Cousin focused on Héloïse as part of his studies on Abelard.
* In 1839, François Guizot, the former minister for public education, published the posthumous essay of his first wife, Pauline de Meulan, as a preface to the hugely-popular first edition of the Lettres d&#x27;Abailard et d&#x27;Héloïse, which were transposed rather than translated into French and in two volumes illustrated by Jean Gigoux.
* In the same year, the colibri Héloïse (Atthis heloisa) is dedicated to her by the ornithologists René Primevère Lesson and Adolphe Delattre.
* In 1845, Jean-Pierre Vibert created a species of rose named after Héloïse.
* Following the romantic tradition, Lamartine published in 1859 a version of Héloïse et Abélard.
* In 1859, Wilkie Collins published the hugely popular novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, which relies on a similar story involving a male tutor ending up in love with his female pupil, told in an epistolary format.
* Charles de Rémusat, a biographer of Abelard, wrote in 1877 a play based on the story of the medieval figures.

== Disputed issues ==

=== Attribution of works ===
The authorship of the writings connected with Héloïse has been a subject of scholarly disagreement for much of their history.

The most well-established documents, and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest, are the series of letters that begin with Abelard&#x27;s &quot;Historia Calamitatum&quot; (counted as letter 1) and encompass four &quot;personal letters&quot; (numbered 2–5) and &quot;letters of direction&quot; (numbers 6–8) and which include the notable &quot;Problemata Heloissae&quot;. Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by Héloïse and Abelard themselves. John Benton is the most prominent modern skeptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson, Peter Dronke, and Constant Mews maintain the mainstream view that the letters are genuine, arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by its advocates&#x27; pre-conceived notions.

=== Heloise, Abelard, and sexual consent ===
The great majority of academic scholars and popular writers have interpreted the story of Héloïse&#x27;s relationship with Abelard as a consensual and tragic romance. However, much controversy has been generated by a disturbing quote from Abelard in the fifth letter in which he implies that sexual relations with Heloise were, at least at some points, not consensual. While attempting to dissuade Heloise from her romantic memories and encourage her to fully embrace religion, he writes: &quot;When you objected to [sex] yourself and resisted with all your might, and tried to dissuade me from it, I frequently forced your consent (for after all you were the weaker) by threats and blows.&quot; Importantly, this passage runs in stark contrast to Heloise&#x27;s depiction of their relationship, in which she speaks of &quot;desiring&quot; and &quot;choosing&quot; him, enjoying their sexual encounters, and going so far as to describe herself as having chosen herself to pursue him amongst the &quot;thousands&quot; of men in Notre Dame. Nevertheless, working solely from the sentence in Abelard&#x27;s fifth letter, Mary Ellen Waithe argued in 1989 that Héloïse was strongly opposed to a sexual relationship, thus presenting her as a victim and depicting an Abelard who sexually harassed, abused, and raped his student. 
Most scholars differ in their interpretation of Abelard&#x27;s self-depiction. According to William Levitan, fellow of the American academy in Rome, &quot;Readers may be struck by the unattractive figure [the otherwise self praising Abelard] cuts in his own pages...Here the motive [in blaming himself for a cold seduction] is part protective...for Abelard to take all the moral burden on himself and shield, to the extent he can, the now widely respected abbess of the Paraclete—and also in part justificatory—to magnify the crime to the proportions of its punishment.&quot; David Wulstan writes, &quot;Much of what Abelard says in the Historia Calamitatum does not ring true: his arrogation of blame for the cold seduction of his pupil is hardly fortified by the letters of Heloise; this and various supposed violations seem contrived to build a farrago of supposed guilt which he must expiate by his retreat into monasticism and by distancing himself from his former lover.&quot;

Heloise is thus motivated in her responses to Abelard&#x27;s letters to set the record straight, that if anything she had initiated their relationship. Héloïse&#x27;s writings express a much more positive attitude toward their past relationship than does Abelard. She does not renounce her encounters as sinful and she does not &quot;accept that [Abelard&#x27;s] love for her could die, even by the horrible act of...castration.&quot;

It is important in investigating these allegations of abuse or harassment on Abelard&#x27;s part to consider the crude sexual ethics of the time (in which a prior relationship was generally taken as establishing consent), Heloise&#x27;s letters which depict her as complicit if not the initiator of sexual interaction, and Abelard&#x27;s position as an abbot relative to Heloise, an abbess, towards whom he owed a debt of responsibility and guardianship. By depicting himself—a castrated and now repentant monk—as to blame for their liaison, he denied Heloise her own sexual scandal and maintained the purity of her reputation. An allegation of sexual impropriety on the part of Heloise would furthermore endanger the sanctity of Abelard&#x27;s property, the Paraclete, which could be claimed by more powerful figures in government or the Catholic Church. Heloise&#x27;s prior convent at Argenteuil and another convent at St. Eloi had already been shut down by the Catholic hierarchy due to accusations of sexual impropriety by nuns. Monasteries run by male monks were generally in no such danger.

Waithe indicated in a 2009 interview with Karen Warren that she has &quot;softened the position [she] took earlier&quot; in light of Mews&#x27; subsequent attribution of the &quot;Epistolae Duorum Amantium&quot; to Abelard and Héloïse (which Waithe accepts), though she continues to find the passage troubling.

== Burial ==
Héloïse&#x27;s place of burial is uncertain. Abelard&#x27;s bones were moved to the Oratory of the Paraclete after his death, and after Héloïse&#x27;s death in 1163/64 her bones were placed alongside his. The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the French Revolution, and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.

This remains, however, disputed. The Oratory of the Paraclete claims Abélard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père Lachaise is merely a monument, or cenotaph. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père Lachaise, Heloise&#x27;s remains are elsewhere.

The book alludes both to the impossibility of Carmela and Mr. Wegler&#x27;s romantic affair, and arguably, and ironically, to the doomed platonic love between Carmela and her daughter, Meadow: for many years it was a mother-daughter tradition to have tea under the portrait of Eloise at the Plaza Hotel.
* Anne Carson&#x27;s 2005 collection &quot;Decreation&quot; includes a screenplay about Abelard and Héloïse.
* Henry Miller uses Abelard&#x27;s &quot;Foreword to Historia Calamitatum&quot; as the motto of &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot; (1938).
* Howard Brenton&#x27;s play &quot;In Extremis: The Story Of Abelard &amp; Heloise&quot; was premiered at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in 2006.
* In the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the character Carmela Soprano finds the letters of &quot;Abelard and Heloise&quot; in the bathroom of her extramarital lover, various parallels are drawn through the 5th season.
* Michael Shenefelt&#x27;s stage play, &quot;Heloise&quot;, 2019

<text>Mark J. Kilgard is a graphics software engineer working at Nvidia.

Prior to joining Nvidia, Mark Kilgard worked at Compaq and Silicon Graphics. While at Silicon Graphics, he authored the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, better known as GLUT, to make it easy to write OpenGL-based 3D examples and demos. The primary reason for this was the lack of a windowing and input API with OpenGL using GLX. 

Mark Kilgard wrote and released many OpenGL technical sample programs during the pushback against Microsoft&#x27;s competitive FUD against the API, and his GLUT toolkit (ported to Windows by Nate Robins) allowed these examples to run cross platform on Windows PC systems as well as SGI workstations.

At Nvidia, Mark Kilgard has helped design important parts of 3D graphics APIs. He has written key whitepapers, including &quot;Cg in Two Pages&quot;. He is the lead author of the NV path rendering extension—a GPU-accelerated method for rendering vector graphics.

Kilgard graduated from Rice University. He has written two books: &quot;OpenGL for the X Window System&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Cg Tutorial&quot; (2003), co-authored with Randima Fernando.

<text>Dominican University of California is a private university in San Rafael, California. It was founded in 1890 as Dominican College by the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. It is one of the oldest universities in California.

Dominican is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). More than 60 academic majors, minors and concentrations, including 11 graduate programs are offered with an average class size of 16. In fall 2020, Dominican had 1374 undergraduate students, including 354 transfer students. Ninety-one percent of students are from California, 6% are from other states and 3% from other nations. In fall 2020, 100% of incoming first-year students received financial aid, 68% identify as ethnically diverse and 23% are the first in their family to attend college. In 2019, Dominican University of California introduced a Test-Optional Policy, allowing first-year students applying for admission to have the option to submit SAT or ACT scores, beginning with the fall 2020 cohort.

The university is a member of NCAA Division II and competes in the Pacific West Conference.

==History==

=== Early history ===

The history of Dominican University of California can be traced to 1850. It was in this year that Joseph Sadoc Alemany was appointed Bishop of Monterey. At the time of this appointment, he was in Italy attending a meeting of the Dominican Order, a Roman Catholic religious order founded by Saint Dominic de Guzmán in France in 1216.

As Bishop Alemany was returning to his new post in California, he stopped in Paris at the Dominican Monastery of the Cross and expressed his desire to have a few Dominican Sisters join him to teach the children of the Forty-niners. A Belgian novice, Sister Mary of the Cross Goemaere (1809–1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name. In 1854, the Dominicans moved to Benicia, California.

Following the leadership of Mother Mary Goemaere, Mother Louis O&#x27;Donnell (1887–1929) moved the motherhouse, a school and novitiate from Benicia to San Rafael in 1889.

In 1890 the Congregation of the Most Holy Name, under the auspices of Mother O&#x27;Donnell, filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of California. With the encouragement of faculty of the University of California in Berkeley, a junior college was opened in 1915, and in 1917 a four-year college, Dominican College, was formed. At that point Dominican College became the first Catholic college in California to grant the bachelor&#x27;s degree to women. Originally a female-only institution, Dominican College became coeducational in 1971.

==Campus==
Dominican occupies approximately in central Marin County in the City of San Rafael. It is situated in a residential neighborhood at the base of San Pedro Mountain. The gardens of the university are a combination of four former family estates and contain over 100 species of trees. A seasonal creek flows east to west through the middle of campus.

===Residence halls===
Almost 90% of freshmen live on-campus. Freshmen are automatically guaranteed a residency on campus while sophomores, juniors and seniors receive on-campus housing through a lottery. All residence halls are co-ed with gender specific bathrooms. Each hall has a resident advisor who oversees the students.

===Points of interest===

====Ansel Adams Collection====
In the 1980s, an alumna remembered that she had her picture taken when she was a student at the college in the 1950s. She went in search of the print. While she didn&#x27;t find her photograph, nearly 100 original Ansel Adams photographs were discovered scattered across campus. These photographs, taken by the not-yet-famous Adams between 1932 and 1952, are part of the Dominican private collection.

====Della Robia Collection====
Enameled terra-cotta sculptures grace the entryways to Meadowlands Hall, Guzman Hall, Archbishop Alemany Library and Caleruega Hall. These terra-cotta sculptures have been made for centuries by the Della Robia family, a famous Florentine family of sculptors and ceramicists which started with Luca della Robbia.

====Forest Meadows Amphitheater====
Forest Meadows Amphitheater is an amphitheater on Dominican&#x27;s Campus. While it used to hold the university&#x27;s Commencement ceremonies, the amphitheater is now used by the Marin Shakespeare Company during the Shakespeare Festival in the fall. The company has been using the amphitheater since 1967.

==Academics==
Dominican focuses on interdisciplinary studies. In the sciences, the university involves undergraduates in sophisticated research projects, and encourages students to present at national academic conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals. In the humanities, students can combine dance and musical performance with the study of philosophy, literature, world cultures, and religion. Dominican also offers undergraduate and graduate programs in business, education, counseling psychology, occupational therapy and nursing. It follows a semester system: Fall (August–December) and Spring (January–May). Classes are also offered in the summer.

===Partnership with Make School===
In 2018, Dominican University of California and San Francisco-based Make School submitted an application to the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) to enter an incubation relationship. The partnership enabled Dominican to offer a minor in Computer Science and Make School to offer an accelerated bachelor&#x27;s degree in Applied Computer Science (ACS) under Dominican&#x27;s oversight. In 2021, Dominican assumed direct delivery of the ACS program.

===Schools/departments===
The university is organized into three schools with the following departments:

School of Liberal Arts and Education
* Art, Art History, Media and Design
* Education Studies
* Literature, Language and Humanities
* Music, Dance and Performing Arts
* Psychology
* Public Affairs

Barowsky School of Business
* Business

School of Health and Natural Sciences
* Counseling Psychology
* Natural Sciences and Mathematics
* Nursing
* Occupational Therapy
* Physician Assistant
* Public Health

===Accreditation===
The university is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission. Specific programs are accredited by specialized accreditors:
* Occupational Therapy: American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc.
* Nursing: Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), State of California Board of Registered Nursing
* Teacher Education: State of California Commission on Teacher Credentialing
* Business: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)

==Organization and administration==
Dominican is a non-profit organization governed by a privately appointed board of trustees along with the university president, provost, vice-presidents and deans. The board currently has 30 voting members who serve three three-year terms and meet four times annually. The trustees elect a president to serve as the general manager and chief executive of the university. Dr. Nicola Pitchford was appointed the tenth president of the university in July 2021.

===Student government===
The Associated Students of Dominican University (ASDU) is the student government for Dominican and helps students plan and provide campus activities, distribute activity funds, initiate changes in policy, and represent themselves to the university&#x27;s administration and the broader community. This group of elected student representatives serves both as the student activities association and the student government board. The members of the ASDU Senate are composed of representatives from all four class levels of regular day program students.

==Student life==
===Traditions===
====Shield Ceremony====
Each fall, the university holds a Shield Ceremony, a tradition that started in the 12th century when Saint Dominic Guzman created the Dominican order. It now continues every fall during Convocation, when the Dominican seniors officially greet the incoming freshmen with a special gift: an illustration of a shield that reflects an inspirational motto. The motto, written by the seniors, is intended to help guide the freshmen throughout their college years and beyond. Four years later at Commencement, a hand-crafted wood carving of the illustrated shield is presented to the graduating class. All of Dominican&#x27;s shields, dating back to the early 1920s, are displayed on campus in the Meadowlands Residence Hall, Guzman Lecture Hall and the Shield Room.

====Convocation/Family Weekend (formerly Spirit Week)====
Once a year, Dominican invites all students and their families for a celebration of the university and its students. It opens with Convocation, a celebration of the academic achievements of Dominican students. Throughout the celebration, all are invited to explore the campus, attend special classes, meet with the President and faculty and cheer on the Dominican Penguins at competitive games. Family Weekend concludes on Sunday with an athletic scrimmage and tailgate party.

====Senior Thesis====
Most academic departments at Dominican require a senior thesis/project, a one-year culminating experience that offers evidence of accomplishment in a discipline or area of inquiry. Like a master&#x27;s thesis, the senior thesis gives students an opportunity as undergraduates, to explore in-depth issues that interest them. The major determines the nature of the thesis/project, which can take many forms: a research document, a novel, a business plan, a portfolio of poetry, or original works of art.

====Baccalaureate Mass and Commencement====
Held the day prior to Commencement, Baccalaureate Mass is a unique tradition that reflects Dominican&#x27;s Catholic heritage. The Mass, planned and led by members of the graduating classes, is held at St. Raphael&#x27;s Church in downtown San Rafael. Students and their families, faculty, staff and friends of the university are invited to attend.

On a Saturday morning in May, the campus community joins graduating students, their families and friends for Commencement. The Dominican tradition includes a procession led by a bagpiper.

===Clubs and organizations===
There are more than forty student clubs and organizations at Dominican with categories including Athletics, Campus Diversity, Religious, Social and Major-Related.

==Athletics==
The Dominican athletic teams are called the Penguins. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Pacific West Conference as a provisional member for most of their sports since the 2009–10 academic year (achieving D-II full member status in 2011–2012); while its men&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in the Western Collegiate Lacrosse League (WCLL) at the Division I level of the Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA). The Penguins previously competed in the California Pacific Conference (Cal Pac) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1996–1997 to 2008–2009.

Dominican competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

<text>The Oil Bowl was a college football bowl game played three times at Rice Field in Houston, Texas in the 1940s. Muddy conditions for the first game, and freezing temperatures for the third game, doomed future contests. In 1949, a junior college bowl game of the same name was played.

==Game results==
==Game summaries==
===1944 Oil Bowl===
Some consider the New Year&#x27;s Day bowl game of 1944 (after the 1943 season) to have been a college division/minor bowl game. Both rosters were made up of varsity players from ranked teams in the 1942 season. This was possible because both schools were participants in the World War II V-12 program. The Southwestern Louisiana Institute (SLI; now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette) team, for example, was composed of over 175 varsity players from other colleges. These numbers included 18 players from 19th-ranked Rice, nine players from 13th-ranked LSU, and eight players from the eighth-ranked Tulsa teams of 1942. These players were not all starters for the team; varsity players from other schools made up the majority of the team.

Alvin Dark of LSU, playing for SLI, passed for a touchdown, ran for a touchdown, and kicked three extra points; he also punted and returned punts for the Bulldogs. Dark later recalled that the game was played in &quot;ankle-deep mud.&quot;

===1946 Oil Bowl===
A three-yard touchdown rush was the opening score in the first ever Oil Bowl, held in Houston on January 1, 1946. Georgia took a 7–0 lead after this touchdown rush and the first quarter ended as such. Tulsa countered with a touchdown rush of their own, though it was only from one yard out. The PAT failed, making the score 7–6 Georgia at halftime. No scoring happened in the third quarter, and Georgia lengthened their lead in the fourth, scoring twice: a 54-yard pass and a 69-yard punt return, each by Charley Trippi. The PAT on the punt return was no good, and the game finished 20–6. Georgia finished with 288 total yards, and Tulsa finished with only 148.

===1947 Oil Bowl===
The second and last Oil Bowl saw No. 11 Georgia Tech take on St. Mary&#x27;s in front of 23,000 spectators in Houston. The Yellow Jackets scored the first touchdown of the game in the first quarter and held a 7–0 lead. The second quarter saw Georgia Tech turn the offense on, outscoring St. Mary&#x27;s 20–7 and taking a 27–7 lead into halftime. The third and fourth quarters were identical in score, with Georgia Tech outscoring St. Mary&#x27;s 7–6 in both, making the second half score 14–12. The Yellow Jackets became the 1947 Oil Bowl champions, defeating St. Mary&#x27;s 41–19.

<text>Price Club was an American warehouse club chain. Founded in 1976, it merged with its competitor, Costco Wholesale, in 1993. The original Price Club warehouse in San Diego, California, is now Costco location number 401.

==History==
Price Club was founded by Sol Price in 1975 after he was forced out of FedMart, another retail chain he had founded. Price and several friends invested $2.5 million to establish Price Club. The first Price Club location opened on July 12, 1976, in San Diego, at the former site of a manufacturing building previously owned by Howard Hughes.

After leaving FedMart, Price noticed that small businesses in San Diego either ordered directly from four or five large wholesalers or they bought locally from relatively small cash-and-carry wholesalers. Therefore, Price Club was originally positioned as a much larger, volume-oriented version of the cash-and-carry wholesale format, meaning that prospective members were required to present resale certificates or professional licenses. Price Club membership was initially only available to business customers, but was later expanded to other groups, such as employees of local businesses, nonprofits, and governments. The company charged shoppers a $25 annual membership fee to purchase bulk products at discount prices in a no-frills warehouse setting. Price Club&#x27;s high sales volume enabled it to pay its employees higher wages and offer greater benefits than typical retailers. The company eventually expanded to 94 locations throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico (in joint venture with Controladora Comercial Mexicana). In 1992, Price Club generated $6.6 billion in revenue and $134.1 million in profit.

In 1993, Price Club merged with its rival Costco and the combined company was known as PriceCostco. Price Club and Costco initially continued to operate as separate chains, with members of either chain being able to shop at both stores. However, by the following year, Price Enterprises was spun off from the combined company and later established PriceSmart in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. In 1997, PriceCostco became Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Clubs were rebranded as Costco.

<text>Randi is both a given name, and a nickname in the English language, popular in North America and Norway. It is primarily a feminine name, although there is recorded usage of the name by men. It may have originated as a pet form of &quot;Miranda&quot; or as a feminine form of &quot;Randy&quot;. In turn, Randy was originally derived from the names &quot;Randall&quot;, &quot;Randolf&quot;, &quot;Randolph&quot;, &quot;Bertrand&quot; and &quot;Andrew&quot;.

In Norway, Randi is a feminine name that emerged in the 1400s as a short form of Ragnfrid (). The original meaning in Old Norse is &quot;God-lovable&quot;. Ragnfríðr was famously used about three different people in runic inscriptions from the Viking era. Later the variant Rangdid was common in the Middle Ages. Over 20 people with the name were mentioned in the Regesta Norvegica. By the 1600s the variant Randi was a common feminine name in Norway.

<doc id="1241072" wikidata="Q6116019" url="?curid=1241072" title="Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend">
<text>Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend is a 1996 book by Richard Wallace in which Wallace proposed a theory that British author Lewis Carroll, whose real name was Charles L. Dodgson (1832–1898), and his colleague Thomas Vere Bayne (1829–1908) were responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders.

This theory was based primarily on a number of anagrams derived from passages in two of Carroll&#x27;s works, &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; for younger readers, and from the first volume of &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot;. Carroll first published both works in 1889 and was probably still working on them during the period of the Ripper murders. Wallace claimed that the books contained hidden but detailed descriptions of the murders. This theory gained enough attention to make Carroll a late but notable addition to the list of suspects, although one that is generally not taken very seriously.

==Criticisms==

Carroll&#x27;s recent biographers and Ripperologists have argued that this theory has some very serious flaws. One of the most vocal critics was Karoline Leach, who in a lecture about Wallace&#x27;s theory gave three main arguments against it:

* The same method of anagrams can be applied to any number of works written in the Latin alphabet and using the English language without proving any intention by the original author. Leach demonstrated her point by reworking passages of A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; to indicate that Milne had also committed murder.
* From August 31 through September 30, 1888, when Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were killed, Carroll was vacationing in Eastbourne, East Sussex along with Isa Bowman, a child actress and personal friend of his. Meanwhile, Thomas Vere Bayne had severe back pain during the summer of 1888 and was barely able to move. On November 9, 1888, when Mary Jane Kelly was killed, both Carroll and Bayne were reportedly in Oxford.
* An August 26, 1891 passage of Carroll&#x27;s diary reports that he spoke that day with Dr. Dabbs, an acquaintance of his, about &quot;his very ingenious theory about &#x27;Jack the Ripper&#x27;&quot;. Although the theory he refers to is unknown, the passage does not indicate that Carroll was personally involved in the murders, as many people throughout England were intensely interested in the case and followed its details closely due to the publicity given to them by the newspapers.

Similarly, anagram aficionados Francis Heaney and Guy Jacobson pointed out that similarly incriminating anagrams could be derived from Wallace&#x27;s own book. When Harper&#x27;s Magazine excerpted &quot;Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend&quot;, Heaney and Jacobson wrote in response that its first three sentences:

are an anagram of:

Carroll has been voted by the staff and readers of &quot;&quot; as the least likely suspect (out of 22 names featured) to have actually been Jack the Ripper.

<doc id="1241092" wikidata="Q901238" url="?curid=1241092" title="Pi backbonding">
<text>In chemistry, pi backbonding or π backbonding is a π-bonding interaction between a filled (or half filled) orbital of a transition metal atom and a vacant orbital on an adjacent ion or molecule. In this type of interaction, electrons from the metal are used to bond to the ligand, which dissipates excess negative charge and stabilizes the metal. It is common in transition metals with low oxidation states that have ligands such as carbon monoxide, olefins, or phosphines. The ligands involved in π backbonding can be broken into three groups: carbonyls and nitrogen analogs, alkenes and alkynes, and phosphines. Compounds where π backbonding is prominent include Ni(CO)4, Zeise&#x27;s salt, and molybdenum and iron dinitrogen complexes.

==Metal carbonyls, nitrosyls, and isocyanides==
The electrons are partially transferred from a d-orbital of the metal to anti-bonding molecular orbitals of CO (and its analogs). This electron-transfer strengthens the metal–C bond and weakens the C–O bond. The strengthening of the M–CO bond is reflected in increases of the vibrational frequencies for the M–C bond (often outside of the range for the usual IR spectrophotometers). Furthermore, the M–CO bond length is shortened. The weakening of the C–O bond is indicated by a decrease in the wavenumber of the &quot;ν&quot;CO band(s) from that for free CO (2143 cm−1), for example to 2060 cm−1 in Ni(CO)4 and 1981 cm−1 in Cr(CO)6, and 1790 cm−1 in the anion [Fe(CO)4]2−. For this reason, IR spectroscopy is an important diagnostic technique in metal–carbonyl chemistry. The article infrared spectroscopy of metal carbonyls discusses this in detail.

Many ligands other than CO are strong &quot;backbonders&quot;. Nitric oxide is an even stronger π-acceptor than CO and νNO is a diagnostic tool in metal–nitrosyl chemistry. Isocyanides, RNC, are another class of ligands that are capable of π-backbonding. In contrast with CO, the σ-donor lone pair on the C atom of isocyanides is antibonding in nature and upon complexation the CN bond is strengthened and the νCN increased. At the same time, π-backbonding lowers the &quot;ν&quot;CN. Depending on the balance of σ-bonding versus π-backbonding, the νCN can either be raised (for example, upon complexation with weak π-donor metals, such as Pt(II)) or lowered (for example, upon complexation with strong π-donor metals, such as Ni(0)). For the isocyanides, an additional parameter is the MC=N–C angle, which deviates from 180° in highly electron-rich systems. Other ligands have weak π-backbonding abilities, which creates a labilization effect of CO, which is described by the &quot;cis&quot; effect.

==Metal–alkene and metal–alkyne complexes==
As in metal–carbonyls, electrons are partially transferred from a d-orbital of the metal to antibonding molecular orbitals of the alkenes and alkynes. This electron transfer strengthens the metal–ligand bond and weakens the C–C bonds within the ligand. In the case of metal-alkenes and alkynes, the strengthening of the M–C2R4 and M–C2R2 bond is reflected in bending of the C–C–R angles which assume greater sp3 and sp2 character, respectively. Thus strong π backbonding causes a metal-alkene complex to assume the character of a metallacyclopropane. Alkenes and alkynes with electronegative substituents exhibit greater π backbonding. Some strong π backbonding ligands are tetrafluoroethylene, tetracyanoethylene, and hexafluoro-2-butyne.

==Metal-phosphine complexes==
Phosphines accept electron density from metal p or d orbitals into combinations of P–C σ* antibonding orbitals that have π symmetry. When phosphines bond to electron-rich metal atoms, backbonding would be expected to lengthen P–C bonds as P–C σ* orbitals become populated by electrons. The expected lengthening of the P–C distance is often hidden by an opposing effect: as the phosphorus lone pair is donated to the metal, P(lone pair)–R(bonding pair) repulsions decrease, which acts to shorten the P–C bond. The two effects have been deconvoluted by comparing the structures of pairs of metal-phosphine complexes that differ only by one electron. Oxidation of R3P–M complexes results in longer M–P bonds and shorter P–C bonds, consistent with π-backbonding. In early work, phosphine ligands were thought to utilize 3d orbitals to form M–P pi-bonding, but it is now accepted that d-orbitals on phosphorus are not involved in bonding as they are too high in energy.

==IUPAC definition of Back Donation==
The full IUPAC definition of back donation is as follows:
A description of the bonding of π-conjugated ligands to a transition metal which involves a synergic process with donation of electrons from the filled π-orbital or lone electron pair orbital of the ligand into an empty orbital of the metal (donor–acceptor bond), together with release (back donation) of electrons from an &quot;n&quot;d orbital of the metal (which is of π-symmetry with respect to the metal–ligand axis) into the empty π*-antibonding orbital of the ligand.

<doc id="1241101" wikidata="Q337231" url="?curid=1241101" title="Hyaluronic acid">
<text>Hyaluronic acid (; abbreviated HA; conjugate base hyaluronate), also called hyaluronan, is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It is unique among glycosaminoglycans as it is non-sulfated, forms in the plasma membrane instead of the Golgi apparatus, and can be very large: human synovial HA averages about per molecule, or about 20,000 disaccharide monomers, while other sources mention .

Medically, hyaluronic acid is used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and dry eye, for wound repair, and as a cosmetic filler.

The average 70 kg (150 lb) person has roughly 15 grams of hyaluronan in the body, one third of which is turned over (i.e., degraded and synthesized) per day.

As one of the chief components of the extracellular matrix, it contributes significantly to cell proliferation and migration, and is involved in the progression of many malignant tumors. Hyaluronic acid is also a component of the group A streptococcal extracellular capsule, and is believed to play a role in virulence.

== Physiological function ==
Until the late 1970s, hyaluronic acid was described as a &quot;&quot; molecule, a ubiquitous carbohydrate polymer that is part of the extracellular matrix. For example, hyaluronic acid is a major component of the synovial fluid and was found to increase the viscosity of the fluid. Along with lubricin, it is one of the fluid&#x27;s main lubricating components.

Hyaluronic acid is an important component of articular cartilage, where it is present as a coat around each cell (chondrocyte). When aggrecan monomers bind to hyaluronan in the presence of HAPLN1 (hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan link protein 1), large, highly negatively charged aggregates form. These aggregates imbibe water and are responsible for the resilience of cartilage (its resistance to compression). The molecular weight (size) of hyaluronan in cartilage decreases with age, but the amount increases.

A lubricating role of hyaluronan in muscular connective tissues to enhance the sliding between adjacent tissue layers has been suggested. A particular type of fibroblasts, embedded in dense fascial tissues, has been proposed as being cells specialized for the biosynthesis of the hyaluronan-rich matrix. Their related activity could be involved in regulating the sliding ability between adjacent muscular connective tissues.

Hyaluronic acid is also a major component of skin, where it is involved in repairing tissue. When skin is exposed to excessive UVB rays, it becomes inflamed (sunburn), and the cells in the dermis stop producing as much hyaluronan and increase the rate of its degradation. Hyaluronan degradation products then accumulate in the skin after UV exposure.

While it is abundant in extracellular matrices, hyaluronan also contributes to tissue hydrodynamics, movement, and proliferation of cells and participates in a number of cell surface receptor interactions, notably those including its primary receptors, CD44 and RHAMM. Upregulation of CD44 itself is widely accepted as a marker of cell activation in lymphocytes. Hyaluronan&#x27;s contribution to tumor growth may be due to its interaction with CD44. Receptor CD44 participates in cell adhesion interactions required by tumor cells.

Although hyaluronan binds to receptor CD44, there is evidence hyaluronan degradation products transduce their inflammatory signal through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, or both TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages and dendritic cells. TLR and hyaluronan play a role in innate immunity.

There are limitations including the &quot;in vivo&quot; loss of this compound limiting the duration of effect.

=== Wound repair ===
As a major component of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronic acid has a key role in tissue regeneration, inflammation response, and angiogenesis, which are phases of wound repair. As of 2023, however, reviews of its effect on healing for chronic wounds including burns, diabetic foot ulcers or surgical skin repairs show either insufficient evidence or only limited positive clinical research evidence. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that hyaluronic acid may be beneficial for ulcer healing and may help to a small degree with pain control. Hyaluronic acid combines with water and swells to form a gel, making it useful in skin treatments as a dermal filler for facial wrinkles; its effect lasts for about 6 to 12 months, and treatment has regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

=== Granulation ===
Granulation tissue is the perfused, fibrous connective tissue that replaces a fibrin clot in healing wounds. It typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size it heals. HA is abundant in granulation tissue matrix. A variety of cell functions that are essential for tissue repair may attribute to this HA-rich network. These functions include facilitation of cell migration into the provisional wound matrix, cell proliferation, and organization of the granulation tissue matrix. Initiation of inflammation is crucial for the formation of granulation tissue; therefore, the pro-inflammatory role of HA as discussed above also contributes to this stage of wound healing.

=== Cell migration ===
Cell migration is essential for the formation of granulation tissue. The early stage of granulation tissue is dominated by a HA-rich extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a conducive environment for the migration of cells into this temporary wound matrix. HA provides an open hydrated matrix that facilitates cell migration, whereas, in the latter scenario, directed migration and control of related cell mechanisms are mediated via the specific cell interaction between HA and cell surface HA receptors. It forms links with several protein kinases associated with cell locomotion, for example, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, focal adhesion kinase, and other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. During fetal development, the migration path through which neural crest cells migrate is rich in HA. HA is closely associated with the cell migration process in granulation tissue matrix, and studies show that cell movement can be inhibited, at least partially, by HA degradation or blocking HA receptor occupancy.

By providing the dynamic force to the cell, HA synthesis has also been shown to associate with cell migration. Basically, HA is synthesized at the plasma membrane and released directly into the extracellular environment. This may contribute to the hydrated microenvironment at sites of synthesis, and is essential for cell migration by facilitating cell detachment.

=== Skin healing ===
HA plays an important role in the normal epidermis. HA also has crucial functions in the reepithelization process due to several of its properties. These include being an integral part of the extracellular matrix of basal keratinocytes, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function, and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration.

In normal skin, HA is found in relatively high concentrations in the basal layer of the epidermis where proliferating keratinocytes are found. CD44 is collocated with HA in the basal layer of epidermis where additionally it has been shown to be preferentially expressed on plasma membrane facing the HA-rich matrix pouches. Maintaining the extracellular space and providing an open, as well as hydrated, structure for the passage of nutrients are the main functions of HA in epidermis. A report found HA content increases in the presence of retinoic acid (vitamin A). The proposed effects of retinoic acid against skin photo-damage and photoaging may be correlated, at least in part, with an increase of skin HA content, giving rise to increased tissue hydration. It has been suggested that the free-radical scavenging property of HA contributes to protection against solar radiation, supporting the role of CD44 acting as a HA receptor in the epidermis.

Epidermal HA also functions as a manipulator in the process of keratinocyte proliferation, which is essential in normal epidermal function, as well as during reepithelization in tissue repair. In the wound healing process, HA is expressed in the wound margin, in the connective tissue matrix, and collocating with CD44 expression in migrating keratinocytes.

== Medical uses ==

Hyaluronic acid has been FDA-approved to treat osteoarthritis of the knee via intra-articular injection. A 2012 review showed that the quality of studies supporting this use was mostly poor, with a general absence of significant benefits, and that intra-articular injection of HA could possibly cause adverse effects. A 2020 meta-analysis found that intra-articular injection of high molecular weight HA improved both pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis.

Hyaluronic acid has been used to treat dry eye. Hyaluronic acid is a common ingredient in skin care products. Hyaluronic acid is used as a dermal filler in cosmetic surgery. It is typically injected using either a classic sharp hypodermic needle or a micro-cannula. Some studies have suggested that the use of micro-cannulas can significantly reduce vessel embolisms during injections. Currently, hyaluronic acid is used as a soft tissue filler due to its bio-compatibility and possible reversibility using hyaluronidase. Complications include the severing of nerves and microvessels, pain, and bruising. Some side effects can also appear by way of erythema, itching, and vascular occlusion; vascular occlusion is the most worrisome side effect due to the possibility of skin necrosis, or even blindness in a patient. In some cases, hyaluronic acid fillers can result in a granulomatous foreign body reaction.

Hyaluronic acid is used to displace tissues away from tissues which are going to be subjected to radiation, for instance in one treatment option for some prostate cancers.

== Sources ==

Hyaluronic acid is produced on a large scale by extraction from animal tissues, such as chicken comb, and from Streptococci.

== Structure ==
Hyaluronic acid is a polymer of disaccharides, which are composed of -glucuronic acid and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine, linked via alternating β-(1→4) and β-(1→3) glycosidic bonds. Hyaluronic acid can be 25,000 disaccharide repeats in length. Polymers of hyaluronic acid can range in size from 5,000 to 20,000,000 Da &quot;in vivo&quot;. The average molecular weight in human synovial fluid is 3–4 million Da, and hyaluronic acid purified from human umbilical cord is 3,140,000 Da; other sources mention average molecular weight of 7 million Da for synovial fluid. Hyaluronic acid also contains silicon, ranging 350–1,900μg/g depending on location in the organism.

Hyaluronic acid is energetically stable, in part because of the stereochemistry of its component disaccharides. Bulky groups on each sugar molecule are in sterically favored positions, whereas the smaller hydrogens assume the less-favorable axial positions.

Hyaluronic acid in aqueous solutions self-associates to form transient clusters in solution. While it is considered a polyelectrolyte polymer chain, hyaluronic acid does not exhibit the polyelectrolyte peak, suggesting the absence of a characteristic length scale between the hyaluronic acid molecules and the emergence of a fractal clustering, which is due to the strong solvation of these molecules.

== Biological synthesis ==
Hyaluronic acid is synthesized by a class of integral membrane proteins called hyaluronan synthases, of which vertebrates have three types: HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. These enzymes lengthen hyaluronan by repeatedly adding -glucuronic acid and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine to the nascent polysaccharide as it is extruded via ABC-transporter through the cell membrane into the extracellular space. The term fasciacyte was coined to describe fibroblast-like cells that synthesize HA.

Hyaluronic acid synthesis has been shown to be inhibited by 4-methylumbelliferone (hymecromone), a 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin derivative.
This selective inhibition (without inhibiting other glycosaminoglycans) may prove useful in preventing metastasis of malignant tumor cells. There is feedback inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by low-molecular-weight hyaluronan (&lt;500 kDa) at high concentrations, but there is stimulation by high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (&gt;500 kDa) when tested in cultured human synovial fibroblasts.

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; recently has been genetically modified to culture a proprietary formula to yield hyaluronans, in a patented process producing human-grade product.

=== Fasciacyte ===
A fasciacyte is a type of biological cell that produces hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrix and modulates the gliding of muscle fasciae.

Fasciacytes are fibroblast-like cells found in fasciae. They are round-shaped with rounder nuclei and have less elongated cellular processes when compared with fibroblasts. Fasciacytes are clustered along the upper and lower surfaces of a fascial layer.

Fasciacytes produce hyaluronan, which regulates fascial gliding.

== Biosynthetic mechanism ==
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear glycosaminoglycan (GAG), an anionic, gel-like, polymer, found in the extracellular matrix of epithelial and connective tissues of vertebrates. It is part of a family of structurally complex, linear, anionic polysaccharides. The carboxylate groups present in the molecule make it negatively charged, therefore allowing for successful binding to water, and making it valuable to cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.

HA consists of repeating β4-glucuronic acid (GlcUA)-β3-&quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) disaccharides, and is synthesized by hyaluronan synthases (HAS), a class of integral membrane proteins that produce the well-defined, uniform chain lengths characteristic to HA. There are three existing types of HASs in vertebrates: HAS1, HAS2, HAS3; each of these contribute to elongation of the HA polymer. For an HA capsule to be created, this enzyme must be present because it polymerizes UDP-sugar precursors into HA. HA precursors are synthesized by first phosphorylating glucose by hexokinase, yielding glucose-6-phosphate, which is the main HA precursor. Then, two routes are taken to synthesize UDP-n-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid which both react to form HA. Glucose-6-phosphate gets converted to either fructose-6-phosphate with &quot;hasE&quot; (phosphoglucoisomerase), or glucose-1-phosphate using &quot;pgm&quot; (α-phosphoglucomutase), where those both undergo different sets of reactions.

UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-n-acetylglucosamine get bound together to form HA via &quot;hasA&quot; (HA synthase).

=== Synthesis of UDP-glucuronic acid ===
UDP-glucuronic acid is formed from &quot;hasC&quot; (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) converting glucose-1-P into UDP-glucose, which then reacts with &quot;hasB&quot; (UDP-glucose dehydrogenase) to form UDP-glucuronic acid.

=== Synthesis of N-acetyl glucosamine ===
The path forward from fructose-6-P utilizes &quot;glmS&quot; (amidotransferase) to form glucosamine-6-P. Then, &quot;glmM&quot; (Mutase) reacts with this product to form glucosamine-1-P. &quot;hasD&quot; (acetyltransferase) converts this into n-acetylglucosamine-1-P, and finally, &quot;hasD&quot; (pyrophosphorylase) converts this product into UDP-n-acetylglucosamine.

=== Final step: Two disaccharides form hyaluronic acid ===
UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-n-acetylglucosamine get bound together to form HA via &quot;hasA&quot; (HA synthase), completing the synthesis.

== Degradation ==
Hyaluronic acid can be degraded by a family of enzymes called hyaluronidases. In humans, there are at least seven types of hyaluronidase-like enzymes, several of which are tumor suppressors. The degradation products of hyaluronan, the oligosaccharides and very low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, exhibit pro-angiogenic properties. In addition, recent studies showed hyaluronan fragments, not the native high-molecular weight molecule, can induce inflammatory responses in macrophages and dendritic cells in tissue injury and in skin transplant.

Hyaluronan can also be degraded via non-enzymatic reactions. These include acidic and alkaline hydrolysis, ultrasonic disintegration, thermal decomposition, and degradation by oxidants.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;hyaluronic acid&quot; is derived from &quot;hyalos&quot; (Greek for vitreous, meaning &#x27;glass-like&#x27;) and uronic acid because it was first isolated from the vitreous humour and possesses a high uronic acid content. The term &quot;hyaluronate&quot; refers to the conjugate base of hyaluronic acid. Since the molecule typically exists &quot;in vivo&quot; in its polyanionic form, it is most commonly referred to as &quot;hyaluronan&quot;.

== History ==
Hyaluronic acid was first obtained by Karl Meyer and John Palmer in 1934 from the vitreous body in a cow&#x27;s eye. The first hyaluronan biomedical product, Healon, was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Pharmacia, and approved for use in eye surgery (i.e., corneal transplantation, cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery, and surgery to repair retinal detachment). Other biomedical companies also produce brands of hyaluronan for ophthalmic surgery.

Native hyaluronic acid has a relatively short half-life (shown in rabbits) so various manufacturing techniques have been deployed to extend the length of the chain and stabilise the molecule for its use in medical applications. The introduction of protein-based cross-links, the introduction of free-radical scavenging molecules such as sorbitol, and minimal stabilisation of the HA chains through chemical agents such as NASHA (non-animal stabilised hyaluronic acid) are all techniques that have been used to preserve its shelf life.

In the late 1970s, intraocular lens implantation was often followed by severe corneal edema, due to endothelial cell damage during the surgery. It was evident that a viscous, clear, physiologic lubricant to prevent such scraping of the endothelial cells was needed.

The name &quot;hyaluronan&quot; is also used for a salt.

== Other animals ==
Hyaluronan is used in treatment of articular disorders in horses, in particular those in competition or heavy work. It is indicated for carpal and fetlock joint dysfunctions, but not when joint sepsis or fracture are suspected. It is especially used for synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis. It can be injected directly into an affected joint, or intravenously for less localized disorders. It may cause mild heating of the joint if directly injected, but this does not affect the clinical outcome. Intra-articularly administered medicine is fully metabolized in less than a week.

According to Canadian regulation, hyaluronan in HY-50 preparation should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat. In Europe, however, the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect, and edibility of the horse meat is not affected.

== Research ==
Due to its accumulation in airway epithelial cells in various respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19, cystic fibrosis, influenza, and sepsis, hyaluronic acid is under study as a possible mediator of lung inflammatory mechanisms, as of 2022.

The high biocompatibility of hyaluronic acid and its common presence in the extracellular matrix of tissues indicate its possible use as a biomaterial scaffold in tissue engineering. In particular, research groups have found hyaluronan&#x27;s properties for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may be improved with cross-linking, producing a hydrogel. Crosslinking may allow a desired shape, as well as to deliver therapeutic molecules into a host. Hyaluronan can be crosslinked by attaching thiols (see thiomers) (trade names: Extracel, HyStem), hexadecylamides (trade name: Hymovis), and tyramines (trade name: Corgel). Hyaluronan can also be crosslinked directly with formaldehyde (trade name: Hylan-A) or with divinylsulfone (trade name: Hylan-B). Hyaluronic acid can also be crosslinked with a bifunctional crosslinking agent 1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) using a ResonantAcoustic mixer over a period of time ranging from about 1 minute to about 10 minutes.

Due to its ability to regulate angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells to proliferate in vitro, hyaluronan can be used to create hydrogels to study vascular morphogenesis.

Research shows that abnormal hyaluronic acid (HA) metabolism is a major factor in tumor progression. HA and HA fragment-tumor cell interaction could activate the downstream signaling pathways, promoting cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion, and inducing angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stem cell-like property, and chemoradioresistance in digestive cancers.

<text>Teenager is a 1996 album by Jane Siberry.

It was her first release for Sheeba Records, the independent label she established for herself after the end of her contract with Reprise Records. The album is composed of songs that Siberry had written as a teenager, but had never subsequently released on record.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; called the album &quot;13 supple, unadorned songs,&quot; writing that &quot;lovely, reflective tunes like &#x27;Puppet City&#x27; and &#x27;Viking Heart&#x27; offer thrillingly adult looks at, respectively, emotional paralysis and the enticements of a handsome, attentive stranger.&quot;

<text>The Chagai Hills is a granite mountain range located in the Chagai District in Balochistan, Pakistan. The Chagai Hills face the border wall at the Durand Line– the official name of Afghanistan–Pakistan border. 

The highest peak, Malik Naru, at the Chagai Hills is measured at and is a site of volcanic Koh-i-Sultan.

==Overview==
===Location and topography===

During its time as part of the India under the British Queen Victoria, the British Geological Survey conducted the geological survey of the Chagai Hills, which was able to provide its coordinates lies between in 1908. The more precise coordinates were provided by the extensive geological survey by the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) which provided the coordinates at in 1983.

The Chagai Hills terrain is mostly consists of dry desert and located in the northernmost area of Chagai District at the international Durand Line– the official name of Afghanistan–Pakistan border. The region where Chagai Hills are located is reported by the extremely dry with no prospect of water, which the GSP conducted a survey in search of water in 1975.

The Chagai Hills are stretched over an area that is approximately and wide. The highest peak, &quot;Malik Naru&quot;, at the Chagai Hills is measured at and is a site of volcanic Koh-i-Sultan.

=== Geology ===
Since 1901, the geology of Chagai Hills have been studied first by the European geologists and later by Pakistani geologists since 1960. The Chagai Hills are mostly granite mountains, some with average height of 

The Pakistani investigations discovered the occurrences of copper, iron, zinc, molybdenum, sulfur, and limestones, the travertine, which is an interest of economic importance. The geological survey to explore uranium was also conducted in the region in 1957.

The Chagai Hills are continuous subject of interest of Volcanology which the Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) has commissioned its studies in a joint venture with the United States since 1997. The Koh-i-Sultan (lit. &quot;Mountain of the King&quot;) is a prominent site where its activity has provided scientific opportunity to the Pakistani seismologists and volcanologists. The fission carbon dating studies were first conducted on rocks and geological structure in 1997, which provided the age of Chagai Hills in Miocene-Late Pleistocene period.

==Climate==
The Chagai Hills lie in an arid dry zone, which is outside the main monsoon belt, and lies in a very remote area since the absence of the water. The Chagai Hills receives only an average of of rain annually. 

The temperature in Chagai Hills is noted to be extreme with summer being very hot and very cold winter. In 2019, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported the average minimum temperature in January, and the average maximum temperature is in July.

==Prominence==

The Chagai Hills were relatively unknown area of interests where only scientific studies on its geological structure was carried out by the Pakistan government until 1994. The Chagai Hills received its prominence and significant attention when it was &quot;incorrectly&quot; mentioned as nuclear test site in a text, &quot;Critical Mass&quot;, published by American authors William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem in 1994.

With Pakistani administrations following the policy of deliberate ambiguity, the Chagai Hills were continuously suspected as a nuclear test site by the Western media outlets. Despite widely international media reporting and the local anti–nuclear protests being staged, there has been no radioactivity nor any nuclear weapon test activity that has ever taken place in the Chagai Hills albeit scientific studies on volcanology and hydrology.

The Ras Koh Range is the official Ministry of Defense range and designated nuclear test site where the nuclear weapon testing took place in 1998. A structural depression actually separates the Ras Koh Hills from the Chagai Hills— the Ras Koh Hills are actually located on the border of Chagai District and the Kharan District. The confusion is attributed in reporting due to the Pakistan&#x27;s MoD codenamed the tests as &quot;Chagai&quot; to maintain secrecy at the actual weapon testing venues.

<text>Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band was the house band for Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s late-night talk show &quot;Conan&quot; from its debut on November 8, 2010 to the final episode of its 60-minute format October 4, 2018. Guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino is the group&#x27;s leader. The group was originally formed and led by drummer Max Weinberg in 1993, and played under the name The Max Weinberg 7 when it was the house band for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in New York through 2009. The band then played under Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band during their brief 2009–2010 stint on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in Los Angeles. They were then briefly known as The Legally Prohibited Band during their participation with O&#x27;Brien in the 2010 The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.

During The Max Weinberg 7 days, the band included Jimmy Vivino on guitar, Richie &quot;LaBamba&quot; Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark &quot;Love Man&quot; Pender on trumpet and acoustic guitar, and Jimmy&#x27;s older brother Jerry Vivino on woodwinds. When the group moved to Los Angeles to become The Tonight Show Band, they added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Wormworth had often substituted as drummer when Weinberg toured with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band, prior to being made a permanent fixture in the band; Jimmy Vivino had served as the band&#x27;s leader during those periods. Weinberg did not participate in the Legally Prohibited Tour and his departure from the group and from O&#x27;Brien was made official in September 2010.

The band&#x27;s final regular appearance on &quot;Conan&quot; was on the show&#x27;s last hour-long episode on October 4, 2018. With the show switching to a half-hour format, it was announced the band would not be returning in 2019. They appeared on four special episodes recorded at San Diego Comic-Con that year, and the final eight episodes of the program in 2021 as Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Four. 

==History==
===The Max Weinberg 7===
Max Weinberg was the drummer for Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band until its dissolution in 1989. Weinberg returned to college to finish his communications degree and contemplated law school, but soon desired to resume drumming. He auditioned to be the principal drummer for the Broadway show &quot;Tommy&quot;, but was selected as the second substitute. That night, Weinberg had a chance sidewalk meeting outside the Carnegie Deli with newly selected &quot;Late Night&quot; host Conan O&#x27;Brien, where Weinberg spoke about his ideas for music on the show. O&#x27;Brien agreed to give Weinberg an audition as bandleader for his forthcoming show. Weinberg quickly put together The Max Weinberg 7, recruiting musicians he had worked with during his career, and got the job.

Rosenberg and Pender had played with The Miami Horns, and had a long joint history with Weinberg from touring or recording together with Springsteen, Southside Johnny, Little Steven, Gary U.S. Bonds, and Darlene Love. In the early 1990s Weinberg and Pender were also in a band together called Killer Joe, which also featured Jimmy and Jerry Vivino. The Vivino brothers were experienced New York session musicians and had been members of various Broadway pit bands. They recruited the final two members of the band, Healy and Merritt, who had played together in various bands such as Jimmy Vivino &amp; The Black Italians and The Vivino Brothers Band. Fill-in James Wormworth was also a member of the Vivino bands, but was initially left out of the ensemble because there was no need for two drummers. 

Members of the band have participated in skits on &quot;Late Night&quot;, particularly fedoraed LaBamba—who rarely speaks on air and is often the punchline of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s jokes—and bald, bespectacled Mark Pender, who will often sing a tribute to one of the show&#x27;s guests only to invariably launch into hysterical shrieking as he climbs the scaffolding of the studio&#x27;s seating area. Pender was also told by O&#x27;Brien to imitate soccer player Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s famous World Cup headbutt due to both Pender and Zidane&#x27;s lack of hair. O&#x27;Brien would tease Wormworth because he drummed barefoot.

Weinberg was often involved in short, awkward, and/or humorous banter with O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien often made jokes about Weinberg&#x27;s supposedly perverse sexual habits. Rosenberg is often the butt of jokes for both his healthy sized mustache and his often awkward demeanor on air, and his sexual orientation is occasionally questioned by O&#x27;Brien through monologue jokes and other comedy bits. O&#x27;Brien often has Rosenberg participate in potentially humiliating skits, such as dressing up his mustache in Christmas lights, or shaving it off. Additionally, Rosenberg provided the falsetto interludes for the formerly regular skits &quot;In the Year 2000&quot; and &quot;In the Year 3000&quot;. A noted incident of ridicule occurred in 2007 when the camera, which had unexpectedly cut to the band for a reaction shot, caught LaBamba consulting his sheet music with a somewhat puzzled look on his face. This caused O&#x27;Brien to draw attention to Rosenberg&#x27;s goof, and to claim that LaBamba could not read music. The others are rarely used in sketches, although Mike Merritt takes part in sketches where O&#x27;Brien talks about race, to which Merritt&#x27;s supposed thoughts are used in a voice-over where he ridicules O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s lack of knowledge about African-American culture and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s own &quot;abnormally&quot; pale complexion.

The show often features a performance by a musical guest (a band or a solo artist) at the end, and some or even all members of The Max Weinberg 7 perform as backup musicians for the guests when needed, such as Weinberg performing the drums for the last half of the Death from Above 1979 song, &quot;Romantic Rights&quot; while singer and drummer Sebastien Grainger stands on the bass drum.

Weinberg has, in the past, taken long leaves of absence to tour with the E Street Band. During his absences, he has typically been replaced by James Wormworth, and the band is led by Jimmy Vivino, then referred to as &quot;Jimmy Vivino and The Max Weinberg 7&quot;. 

The band plays an eclectic selection of music on the show, including frequent performances of songs by The Clash, one of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s favorite bands. Examples of songs by The Clash performed by the group include &quot;Police on my Back&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;, &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot; and &quot;Train in Vain&quot;. 

The band will often play a song to match a holiday or event (&quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; on Valentine&#x27;s Day), or sometimes play a song that is irrelevant to the event, causing O&#x27;Brien to question their choice of song (&quot;Paint It Black&quot; during Christmas).

The band&#x27;s song &quot;R.C.4&quot; featured in the film &quot;Bewitched&quot; (2005).

Members of the band performed with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Super Bowl XLIII.

===Max Weinberg and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; Band===
When O&#x27;Brien relocated to Los Angeles to become host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, The Max Weinberg 7 relocated with him, and added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Jimmy Vivino and Weinberg reworked the &quot;Late Night&quot; theme into a &quot;less manic&quot; &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; theme. The backdrop used for the bandstand depicts the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building set within a Los Angeles skyline, in recognition of the &quot;Late Night&quot; roots.

As part of his preparation for the move, Weinberg consulted with Doc Severinsen, the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; band leader during the Johnny Carson days.

As was the case on &quot;Late Night&quot;, Weinberg temporarily left the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on occasion to tour with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Jimmy Vivino took over as bandleader in this instance, and Wormworth moved over to drums. Ronnie Gutierrez was also brought in to cover for Wormworth on percussion. In the open, announcer Andy Richter referred to the group as &quot;The Tonight Show Band&quot;, and the graphic was changed to acknowledge Weinberg&#x27;s absence.

Also, as a result, a skit was born that whenever Weinberg appears on his last show before leaving, O&#x27;Brien would note that Weinberg deserves a &#x27;proper send-off&#x27; and the band would start playing, as suddenly his pedestal would begin to drive itself outside the studio with Weinberg still playing. The pod would then move into the streets of Los Angeles where usually something absurd would happen such as Weinberg being pulled over or hit by a speeding truck.

The band left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; along with O&#x27;Brien after O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s last show as host, which aired January 22, 2010.

===The Legally Prohibited Band===
In April 2010, Conan O&#x27;Brien began his The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. While the rest of the group was part of the tour under the moniker The Legally Prohibited Band, Weinberg was not, though he did appear at the tour&#x27;s New York stop. Weinberg later revealed that he had undergone complex open heart valve repair surgery two weeks after the conclusion of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and had taken three months to recover from it.

===Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band===

It was initially unknown whether Weinberg would be joining O&#x27;Brien when his new late night show on TBS began in November 2010. Most or all of the rest of the band were expected to follow O&#x27;Brien, alongside his other non-musical staff and crew, to the TBS program. By September 2010, it was clear that Weinberg would not be part of the show, now named &quot;Conan&quot;. Jimmy Vivino was now the leader of the band, with Wormworth full-time on drums, and the band was firmly ensconced in Los Angeles as a base. Upon announcing Weinberg&#x27;s split from O&#x27;Brien in September 2010, O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;Max has been a huge part of my life for the past 17 years and he is an incredible band leader and musician.&quot; Weinberg said, &quot;my association with Conan, his staff, and crew has been a deeply rewarding experience for me. And, making music with Jimmy Vivino, Mark Pender, La Bamba, Scott Healy, Mike Merritt, and percussionist James Wormworth enabled me to become a better musician and bandleader. I thank them for their first-rate work on the bandstand. I wish Conan and his show the best and I do look forward to dropping by.&quot; Both looked forward to Weinberg occasionally stopping by to sit in on the new show. Weinberg said his health was better than ever but that the &quot;life-changing experience emotionally and spiritually&quot; of the surgery and a desire to remain in New Jersey with his family had played a chief role in his departure from the band and O&#x27;Brien.

On October 19, 2010, it was announced that the new band name for the &quot;Conan&quot; show would be Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band.

Weinberg made a cameo appearance in a monologue bit on the October 28, 2014 episode of &quot;Conan&quot;, briefly &quot;filling in&quot; on drums for regular drummer Wormworth, who had &quot;gone missing&quot; in the middle of the episode.

On October 4, 2018, with the announcement of the show’s switch to a half-hour format, it was announced that The Basic Cable Band would no longer appear regularly on the program. Members did reunite for four special episodes at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, and for the show&#x27;s final eight episodes (as Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Four) in June 2021.

<text>Dujiangyan () is a county-level city of Sichuan Province, Southwest China, it is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Chengdu. Its north-west region forms a border with southern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. It has an area of and had a population of 710,056 in 2020.

Dujiangyan was formerly a county named Guanxian or Guan County (). The county became a county-level city in 1988 and was renamed after the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, in the city&#x27;s northwest, famous for providing Chengdu with water for over two millennia, since around 250 BC.

==History==
Around 250 BC during the Warring States period, Li Bing, a governor of Shu (present Sichuan Province) in the Qin state with his son directed the construction of Dujiangyan. Li Bing gave up the old ways of dam building, which were simply directed at flood control, employing a new method of channeling and dividing the water of the Min River. He accomplished this by separating the project into two main parts: the headwork and the irrigation system. The whole system has functioned for 2,000 years, preventing floods and providing substantial irrigation and facilitating shipping and wood drifting. It has contributed greatly to the richness of Chengdu Plain with its reputation as &quot;The Land of Abundance&quot;.

On 12 May 2008, the city was the closest to the epicenter of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and the city suffered severe damage. Xinjian Primary School, Juyuan Middle School, and Xiang&#x27;e Middle School collapsed in the earthquake.

==Climate==
Dujiangyan has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) with cool, dry winters and hot, very wet summers.

==Administrative divisions==
Dujiangyan has 6 subdistricts and 5 towns:

* Kuiguangta Subdistrict 奎光塔街道

<text>Charles Emil Ruthenberg (July 9, 1882 – March 1, 1927) was an American Marxist politician who was the founder and first head of the American Communist Party (CPUSA). He is one of four Americans to be buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Charles Emil Ruthenberg was born July 9, 1882, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Wilhelmina (née Lau) and August Charles Ruthenberg. Ruthenberg&#x27;s parents were ethnic Germans and Lutherans who emigrated from Prussia in 1882. In America, young &quot;Charlie&#x27;s&quot; father first worked in America on the docks of the Cuyahoga River as a longshoreman. In later years the elder Ruthenberg went into business for himself with a son-in-law, tending bar at a saloon frequented evenings by those who worked on the docks.

Ruthenberg graduated from the local parochial Lutheran school in June 1896.

He went to work in a bookstore, attending Berkey and Dyke&#x27;s Business College in the evenings for a ten-month course in bookkeeping, accounting, and typing.

He entered Columbia University in 1903. During this time period he also worked as the bookkeeper and sales manager for the Selmar Hess Publishing Company, overseeing more than 30 salesmen throughout the Middle West. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1909.

==Political career==
===Socialist years (1908–1918)===
Ruthenberg&#x27;s first political attraction was to Tom L. Johnson, a Single Taxer and reform mayor of Cleveland from 1901 to 1909. Ruthenberg was drawn to more radical left-wing politics, and in mid-1908 began calling himself a socialist.

During his time at Columbia University, which he entered in 1903, he first became involved with anarchist groups. After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1909, he joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA). 
Ruthenberg was an organizer for and, later, secretary of Local Cuyahoga County from 1909 to 1919. In addition he was on the Ohio State Executive Committee of the SPA from 1911 to 1916, where he edited the newspapers &quot;The Cleveland Socialist&quot; (1911–1913) and &quot;Socialist News&quot; (1914–1919). He also contributed material to the official organ of the Socialist Party of Ohio, &quot;The Ohio Socialist.&quot; He was elected to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1915 but was defeated by Arthur LeSueur at the annual meeting for election to the party&#x27;s governing National Executive Committee.

During this time Ruthenberg traveled to many cities throughout the American Northeast and Midwest, speaking to labor groups, trade union organizations, and anti-war groups, building a network of contacts. He was associated with the far left so-called &quot;Impossibilist&quot; wing of the SPA, which had little hope for the efficacy of ameliorative reform, seeking instead revolutionary socialist transformation.

Ruthenberg was a frequent candidate on the ticket of the Socialist Party. His first electoral failure came in 1910, when he ran for Ohio&#x27;s state treasurer on the Socialist ticket. In 1911 he ran for mayor of Cleveland, in 1912 for Governor of Ohio, for U.S. Senate in 1914. In 1915 he ran again for mayor of Cleveland and in 1916 he ran for United States Congressman. In 1917 he made his third run for mayor of Cleveland (receiving 27,000 votes of 100,000 cast), followed by his second run for Congress in 1918. His final fourth and final run for mayor of Cleveland came in 1919.

Ruthenberg was a delegate to the seminal 1917 Emergency National Convention of the SPA. There he was elected to the Committee on War and Militarism and was one of three primary authors of the aggressively antimilitarist St. Louis program, along with Morris Hillquit and Algernon Lee.

After American entry into World War I, Ruthenberg continued to publicly attack the imperialist conflict and America&#x27;s participation in it. He was charged with violating the Espionage Act, accused of obstructing the draft in connection with a speech given at a rally on May 17, 1917. Also charged at the same time were Alfred Wagenknecht and Charles Baker. They were tried together in July 1917 and sentenced to one year in the Ohio State Penitentiary, a decision upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 15, 1918. Informed of this decision, issued a statement declaring

The Supreme Court has decided we must spend a year in jail. The crime for which we are convicted is truth telling. We believe in certain principles; we fought for those principles, and we go to jail ostensibly for inducing a certain Alphones Schue not to register. The charge is merely an excuse... The important fact is that the ruling class feared our message to the workers and tried to silence that message. That fact should make a hundred willing workers take up the work we lay down...
Ruthenberg, Wagenknecht, and Baker served almost 11 months of their sentence and were released on December 8, 1918.

===1919 Cleveland May Day Riot===
Freed from prison in December 1918, Ruthenberg dove in with both feet to the burgeoning left wing movement rocking the Socialist Party. May Day of 1919 was an event of enormous enthusiasm and great fear. A gigantic assembly was planned in Cleveland, in which four parades of marchers, many waving red flags, came together in the public square to hear speeches and rally for freedom for Eugene V. Debs and Tom Mooney and the adoption of the 6-hour day and the $1 minimum wage. As many as 20,000 people are said to have participated in the march, with 20 to 30,000 more people lining the streets to watch. Ruthenberg later described the events that followed:

When the head of the line was within a block of the Public Square the first trouble occurred. An officer in the uniform of the Red Cross jumped from a &quot;Victory&quot; Loan truck and endeavored to take a red flag which a soldier in uniform was carrying at the head of the procession. A scuffle followed in which other soldiers from the truck and some businessmen joined. During the scuffle one of these businessmen drew a revolver and wildly threatened the workers in the procession. In five minutes, however, the struggle was over. The lieutenant and his supporters were driven back to the sidewalk, the head of the line reformed, and with the red flag still flying, marched on to the Public Square.

Suddenly, the police made their appearance:

They came down Superior Ave., which divides the &quot;Square&quot; into northern and southern sections, headed by the mounted squad, followed by auto load after load. The newspapers later reported that 700 men had been concentrated at the Central Station, who now descended upon the marchers... The first thousand or so of workers marched onto the square and took possession of the &quot;Victory&quot; Loan speakers&#x27; stand, which had been built over the stone blocks placed on the Public Square for the use of speakers at public meetings... The chairman was about to introduce [me] as the first speaker when an officer and a few soldiers tried to climb to the platform, demanding that the soldier that held the red flag give it up... [Then], without warning, a squad of mounted police dashed into the audience, driving their horses over the assembled workers and clubbing them as they went.&quot;
A riot ensued, pitting the police and their supporters (backed by tanks) against the marchers. Two marchers were killed in the fighting, hundreds injured, and about 150 arrested in this Cleveland May Day Riot. Ruthenberg was charged for incitement to murder in connection with this event but no conviction was obtained.

===Formation of the CPUSA===
Ruthenberg was an early endorser of the Left Wing Manifesto written by Louis C. Fraina and around which the formal Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party congealed. He was a Left Wing-supported candidate for the Socialist Party&#x27;s governing National Executive Committee in the party election of 1919, the result of which was overturned by the outgoing NEC ostensibly on the grounds of election fraud carried out by some of the branches associated with the party&#x27;s language federations.

Ruthenberg was a delegate to the June 1919 Convention of the Left Wing Section and was elected there as a member of the faction&#x27;s governing National Council. He was initially supportive of the tactic of continuing to fight &quot;to win the Socialist Party for the Left Wing&quot; at its forthcoming 1919 Emergency National Convention in Chicago, but in the face of federation pressure for immediate formation of a Communist Party USA and the apparently hopeless task faced by Wagenknecht &amp; Co., he shifted his support to the Federations and their call for an immediate Communist Party.

Dominated as it was sure to be by the Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Latvian language federations, the anglophonic Ruthenberg was a valuable commodity to federation leaders like Alexander Stoklitsky, Nicholas Hourwich, and Joseph Stilson. Nor did Ruthenberg owe any allegiance to the idiosyncratic Socialist Party of Michigan, led by John Keracher and Dennis Batt. Therefore, the ambitious Ruthenberg made an ideal candidate to head the new organization, which was established in Chicago on September 1, 1919, as the Communist Party of America (CPA). While decisive authority on the floor of the convention and on the Central Executive Committee which it elected remained in the hands of the so-called &quot;Russian Federations,&quot; He was elected by the Chicago conclave as the first Executive Secretary of the new organization. Ironically, it was his old Ohio party comrade and prison mate, Alfred Wagenknecht, who was elected to head the rival Communist Labor Party of America in the aftermath of the failed effort to win control of the Socialist Party at its August 1919 Convention.

A period of bitter and acrimonious rivalry followed, in which both of the competing American communist organizations sought to win the favor (and financial support) of the Communist International (Comintern). Adding to the complexity of the situation, the Socialist Labor Party of America and the Socialist Party of America sought affiliation with the Comintern as well. The Comintern was adamant about its structure, however, and it sought one and only one centralized organization in each country. Merger between the CPA and CLP was demanded.

The fulfillment of the Comintern&#x27;s demand for unity proved to be no simple task, however, and the history of the next three years are a complex tale of splits, mergers, secret conventions, organized caucuses, and parallel organizations that lies outside of the scope of this presentation. In outline terms, a fight erupted among the leadership of the CPA in 1920 and Ruthenberg, together with a group of his English-speaking adherents such as Isaac Ferguson and Jay Lovestone as well as the Chicago-based section of the Russian federation, exited the organization (along with a major part of the group&#x27;s funds) in April 1920 and joined with the Communist Labor Party to form the United Communist Party (UCP) in May.

Wagenknecht headed this new joint organization with Ruthenberg placed in charge of the party press. This still left a divided Communist movement, however, with the major part of the old CPA, now headed by Charles Dirba still remaining in increasingly bitter opposition. It was not until the end of 1922 — after another merger, split, and merger — that this rift was finally resolved, with the establishment with a new unified Communist Party of America and its parallel &quot;Legal Political Party,&quot; the Workers Party of America (WPA).

During much of this complicated dance, Ruthenberg was in jail. In October 1920, he was tried together with his associate Isaac Ferguson in New York for alleged violation of the state&#x27;s criminal anarchism law, said to have been breached by the Left Wing Section when it published Fraina&#x27;s Left Wing Manifesto the previous year. The pair were tried and sentenced to five years&#x27; confinement in the State Penitentiary on October 29, 1920. The pair sat in Dannemora Prison until finally released on a $5,000 bond on April 24, 1922. Ruthenberg was immediately made Executive Secretary of the WPA upon his release on bail, with Abram Jakira in charge of daily operations of the parallel and underground CPA.

The above-ground WPA headed by Ruthenberg grew rapidly, boosted by the addition of the massive Finnish Federation to its ranks, while the underground party withered and died, put to bed for good in 1923. Thereafter he was the sole Executive Secretary of the American Communist Party (still calling itself the Workers Party of America) — a position which he retained for the rest of his life, despite spending much of the 1920s as a leader of a minority faction within the party.

The criminal anarchism convictions of Ruthenberg and Ferguson were ultimately overturned by the New York Supreme Court In July 1922, just in time for another round of prosecutions, this time related to ill-fate August 1922 Unity Convention of the CPA held at Bridgman, Michigan.

===1922 Bridgman Convention and its aftermath===

A secret conclave had been arranged at the Wolfskeel Resort on the wooded shore of Lake Michigan to finally unite the CPA with a parallel organization maintained by its dissident Central Caucus faction. The site was regarded as relatively safe, having previously been used for a secret convention of the United Communist Party in the spring of 1920. This time, however, an informant of the US Department of Justice had managed to win election to the gathering as a delegate and the authorities had been notified.

The forced merger did not, however, end the rivalries between the two groups. Ruthenberg and his supporter Jay Lovestone were at odds with a rival faction led by William Z. Foster, who had strong ties to organized labor and who wanted to direct the party&#x27;s work toward organizing within the American-born working class, and James P. Cannon, who led the International Labor Defense organization.

Ruthenberg ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio&#x27;s 20th congressional district (now abolished) as the candidate of the Workers Party of America, as the CPUSA&#x27;s legal organization was then known, on his return to the United States.

In 1925, Comintern representative Sergei Gusev ordered the majority Foster faction to surrender control to Ruthenberg&#x27;s faction; Foster complied. The factional infighting within the CPUSA did not end, however; the communist leadership of the New York locals of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union lost the 1926 strike of cloakmakers in New York City in large part because of intra-party factional rivalries, as neither group wanted to take the responsibility for accepting a strike settlement that appeared insufficiently revolutionary .

In 1926–27 his First Amendment case, &quot;Ruthenberg v. Michigan,&quot; was pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court had voted 7–2 (with Brandeis joined by Holmes dissenting) against Ruthenberg. But Ruthenberg died shortly before the Court rendered its ruling, rendering the case moot; thus the opinions in the case were never published.

==Personal life, and memorial plaque==

Ruthenberg married Rosaline &quot;Rose&quot; Nickel, also of German descent, in June 1904. In 1905 the couple had a son named Daniel, their only child. 

Ruthenberg died on March 1, 1927, in Chicago after undergoing surgery for acute peritonitis. He was cremated and an urn containing his ashes was transported to Moscow and carried in an April 26 Comintern funeral procession where it was placed in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, not far from the burial place of his former factional rival John Reed.

==Works==

As the head of the American Communist Party, Ruthenberg was essentially an administrator rather than a theoretician. His early journalism is scattered, he wrote relatively few pamphlets, and he published no books in his lifetime, save for a slim volume gathering his 1920 New York trial testimony with that of Isaac Ferguson, who also served as attorney in his case. A small volume of excerpts of speeches was also published by the Communist Party in 1928, shortly after his death. Nor has the CPUSA, despite Ruthenberg&#x27;s iconic status in party history, published any significant portion of his work in subsequent years. This paucity of available material has been mitigated to some extent in the internet age, with an appreciable slice of his journalism gradually becoming available online.

<text>In sports, a time-out (or timeout) is a halt in the play. This allows the coaches of either team to communicate with the team, e.g., to determine strategy or inspire morale, as well as to stop the game clock. Time-outs are usually called by coaches or players, although for some sports, TV timeouts are called to allow media to air commercial breaks. Teams usually call timeouts at strategically important points in the match, or to avoid the team being called for a delay of game-type violation, such as the five-second rule in basketball.

==List of time-out rules by sport==

===Association football===
With very few exceptions (such as the defunct North American Soccer League&#x27;s experimentation with TV timeouts) timeouts have never been permitted in association football. Moreover, the game clock runs continuously in each half, even if extenuating circumstances compel the referee to halt play for an extended period of time, unless and until the match is abandoned. However, the referee adds stoppage time at the end of each half to ensure roughly 45 minutes of actual play is completed in each half after accounting for the amount of time play is interrupted.

===Baseball===

Baseball players and managers of both the offense and defense can request time out for a number of purposes, such as for a batter to step out of the batter&#x27;s box to better prepare for a pitch, a foreign object entering a batter&#x27;s eye such as dust or a bug, for a manager to speak with a player or umpire, or to replace one player with another (for which a time-out is required by the rules), etc. The requested time out is not effective unless an umpire grants it verbally or by hand signal (both hands raised). The umpire also has the ability to call time out for his/her own purposes, or for purposes of the game, such as replacing a worn ball. Since there is no clock in baseball, the main effect of a time out is to temporarily prevent the defensive team from tagging base runners out or delivering a pitch as well as to prevent base runners from advancing. However, the catcher may also request timeout once the pitcher has stepped on the rubber, usually with the intention of either &quot;resetting&quot; the play, or to deliver some information to the pitcher via either signals or a visit to the mound. Under certain (uncommon) circumstances specified by the rules, umpires are required to call time out, even while a play is in progress, such as certain cases of interference. Unlike many other sports, the rules of baseball do not limit time outs, either by number or duration. The end of the time out is indicated by an umpire verbally declaring &quot;Play!&quot; and/or by pointing at the pitcher while he is holding the ball (these umpire signals are identical to those used to start a game or resume play after the ball has become &quot;dead&quot;, for example due to a half-inning ending). Since baseball provides natural breaks in the action when teams exchange offensive and defensive roles between half-innings (two minutes, five seconds normally; two minutes and twenty-five seconds for nationally televised games), TV timeouts are not necessary.

Other than coaching visits, which the umpires ensure stay brief, timeouts theoretically have no time limits. However, when no runners occupy a base, a pitcher must deliver the pitch within twelve seconds of receiving the ball from the catcher or else a &quot;delay of game&quot; is called, resulting in a ball. Also, any relief pitcher is limited to eight warm-up throws before play resumes, except in special circumstances (such as a pitcher substitution due to injury).

Though not officially recognized as a &quot;timeout&quot;, a stoppage in play can also be requested by the defense. This can be accomplished in several ways. First, once in his &quot;set&quot; position, the pitcher may stop play by stepping off the rubber prior to his windup. Secondly, the catcher may visit the pitcher at any point before he steps on the rubber. Finally, the manager or pitching coach may also visit the pitcher before he steps on the rubber (called a &quot;coaching visit&quot;). Under Major League Baseball (MLB) rules, a team is limited to one visit per inning and a maximum of three per game. Under NFHS (high school) rules, a team receives three mound visits for the game and can use more than one an inning. If a team exceeds the limit in either MLB or high school ball, the pitcher must be removed immediately.

===Basketball===
====NCAA====
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) uses four systems of timeouts. Regardless of the specific system, either players or coaches can call timeouts.

In men&#x27;s games that are not broadcast, each team is allowed four 75-second and two 30-second timeouts per regulation game.

In women&#x27;s games that are not broadcast, each team is allowed two 60-second and three 30-second timeouts per regulation game. Each team receives one extra 30-second timeout per overtime period.

In men&#x27;s games which are being broadcast, as of the 2015-16 season, each team is granted one 60-second timeout and three 30-second timeouts per game in addition to the media timeouts (at the first dead ball under 16, 12, 8 and 4 minutes remaining in each half). A maximum of two 30-second timeouts may carry over into the second half. Any called timeout that occurs within the 30 seconds prior to a scheduled media timeout break automatically takes the place of the upcoming media timeout, with the only exception to this rule being the first called timeout of the second half. A timeout cannot be called by a coach when the ball is live. Previously, under NCAA rules in prior seasons, teams had a total of five timeouts, and timeouts superseding media timeouts were only used in the women&#x27;s rules.

With the NCAA women&#x27;s game being played in quarters instead of halves, a separate system is used in women&#x27;s broadcast games. Each team receives one 60-second and three 30-second timeouts per game, in addition to media timeouts at the first dead ball on or after the 5-minute mark of each quarter. The first called timeout of each quarter, if taken before the 5-minute mark, replaces that quarter&#x27;s media timeout. Unlike the men&#x27;s game, all unused 30-second timeouts carry over to all subsequent periods. As in non-broadcast games, each team receives an extra 30-second timeout per overtime period.

====NFHS====
High school basketball allots five timeouts per game, with three 60-second and two 30-second timeouts. In overtime games, each team is given one additional 60-second timeout in each overtime period, and is allowed to carry over any unused timeouts from regulation or – if the case may be – previous overtimes. Media timeouts are typically reserved for televised state tournament games only.

Coaches and players can call timeouts. While the ball is live, only the team in control of the ball can request a timeout.

====NBA====
In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams are allowed seven timeouts, each of 1 minute, 15 seconds. There is no limit on substitutions. In overtime periods, each team is allowed two timeouts. A timeout can only be requested by a player in the game or the head coach, and only when the ball is dead or in control of the team making the request. If a request for a timeout is made with none remaining, the offending team is assessed a technical foul and loses possession. 

In each quarter, there are two mandatory timeouts. If no team has taken a timeout prior to 6:59 of the period, then the next time the ball is dead, the official scorer calls a timeout and charges it to the home team. If no subsequent timeouts have been taken prior to 2:59 of the period, the official scorer declares it and charges it to the team not previously charged. The first and second timeouts in a quarter are extended to 2:45 for locally televised games and 3:15 for nationally televised games, to accommodate advertising.

A team is limited to a maximum of four timeouts in the fourth quarter, losing any timeouts not yet taken. With three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, a team is limited to two timeouts. However, if one team has yet to be charged its mandatory timeout, then the limit applies after the mandatory timeout is taken.

With less than two minutes to go in the game or overtime period, if the offensive team takes a timeout prior to inbounding the ball or if it secures the ball from a rebound or turnover but prior to advancing it, the team may choose to inbound the ball at midcourt.

The rules were changed before the 2017-18 NBA season to eliminate the distinction between &quot;full&quot; and &quot;20-second&quot; timeouts (which were actually 60 seconds by rule) and eliminate a third mandatory timeout in the second and fourth quarters. The changes sped up the pace of play and addressed a common fan complaint that the last few minutes of a game dragged due to excessive timeouts. However, some coaches call several timeouts before the three-minute mark to avoid losing them.

====FIBA====

Under FIBA rules, each team is allowed two time-outs in the first half, three time-outs in the second half, and one time-out in each overtime period. Only two time-outs may be granted to each team during the last two minutes of the fourth quarter.

Unlike in most other rule sets, only coaches are allowed to call time-outs. A time-out request may be made to the scorer&#x27;s table at any time, but it may only be granted by a referee when the ball is dead and the game clock is not running. A time-out may also be granted after a scored goal, but only to the team that was scored upon. If a time-out is granted to the team in possession of the ball during the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or any overtime, the head coach of the team calling the time-out may choose to have the game resumed with a throw-in either from a designated line in the team&#x27;s frontcourt or from the place in the backcourt nearest to where the game was stopped.

In televised games, media time-outs may be used at the discretion of the game&#x27;s organizing body. They may be up to 100 seconds long. One of these time-outs will occur in each quarter, but no media time-outs are allowed during overtime. If a time-out is requested by either team during the first five minutes of a quarter, this time-out will be considered a media time-out and will also be charged to the appropriate team. If neither team has requested a time-out by the first dead ball after the five-minute mark in a quarter, a media time-out shall be taken. This time-out is not charged to either team.

===Beach volleyball===
In beach volleyball, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) stipulates one 30-second time-out allowed per team, per set. In FIVB World Competitions, there is an additional 30-second technical time-out in sets 1–2 when the sum of both scores is equal to 21.

===Cricket===
During the 2009 season of the Indian Premier League of T20 cricket, the halfway point of each innings contained a seven-and-a-half minute television timeout, two-thirds of which were devoted to additional advertising time. After complaints by viewers and players (criticizing its commercial purpose and for breaking the flow of the game), the following season replaced them with two sponsored and compulsory two-and-a-half minute &quot;strategic timeouts&quot; that must be taken by each side at certain points during the innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the 6th to 10th overs, and the batting team between the 13th to 16th overs.

===Floorball===
In floorball, each team is allowed one thirty-second time-out per game, which may only be taken during a normal stoppage of play. The time-out is measured from when all the players are gathered around the team benches.

===Gridiron football===

In gridiron football, either team may call for a timeout while the ball is dead. They can be called by players (typically the quarterback or a linebacker) or by the head coach. Importantly, the clock stops if it is running when the timeout is called. Both teams may call one timeout during the same dead ball period. In American football (National Football League (NFL), college, and high school), each team is given three timeouts per half. In Canadian football, each team is given two timeouts per half in amateur leagues and two per game in the Canadian Football League (CFL). Two CFL timeout rules are used only in that league. First, timeouts can be carried over between the first and second halves. Second, a team can call only one timeout after the three-minute warning in the fourth quarter. In the NFL, timeouts are two minutes in length unless the requisite number of commercial breaks in the quarter have been used, or it is the second timeout in the same dead ball period, in which cases the timeout is 30 seconds long. 

Common reasons for calling a timeout include:
*As part of the team&#x27;s clock management strategy, discussed in detail below.
*To prevent the team from being assessed a penalty such as delay of game (offense) or too many men on the field (defense)
*To prevent a play from taking place when the coach is not confident in their team&#x27;s play call

In the NFL, college football, and CFL, a timeout is assessed against a team if a head coach unsuccessfully challenges a play.

Because timeouts are such important parts of a team&#x27;s clock management strategy, calling timeouts for other reasons is often seen as unfavorable. An analysis of timeout usage by NFL head coaches conducted during the 2021 season showed that more than half of the head coaches on average used more &quot;unnecessary&quot; timeouts (i.e., those used to prevent a penalty or an unfavorable play, or lost coach&#x27;s challenges) per game than &quot;time-saving&quot; timeouts (i.e., those used to manage the game clock). 

====As clock management strategy====
The use and rationing of time-outs is a major part of clock management strategy; calling time-out stops the clock (which normally is running between plays except in the case of a penalty, an incomplete pass, officials requiring time to re-spot the ball and/or down markers, or when the ball is run out of bounds), extending the time a team has to score. Timeouts can be called by both players (typically the quarterback or a linebacker) and the head coach. If overtime is required in the NFL, each team is given two timeouts during a ten-minute regular season sudden-death period (overtime periods are fifteen minutes in the playoffs), while in college football each team gets one timeout per possession. In the CFL, overtime is untimed and teams receive no additional timeouts. If a timeout above these limits is called, it is usually ignored and no penalty is assessed (however, in many leagues, a coach attempting to call a timeout when he has no timeouts left can be assessed a 5-yard Delay of Game penalty).

Teams use several methods to stop the clock without exhausting a timeout. These include:
* Running out of bounds with the ball. In the NFL, this only stops the clock in the final two minutes of the first half and final five minutes of the second half; the rest of the time, the clock stops only temporarily, restarting when the ball is set for the next play. In arena football, the clock stops only for out-of-bounds plays in the final minute of the half.
* Throwing the ball out of bounds. This is an incomplete pass, and depending on the circumstances risks incurring an intentional grounding penalty, but sometimes, the team may choose to sacrifice a down to stop the clock.
* Spiking the ball. This act, likewise, is an incomplete pass and sacrifices a down, but when performed immediately after the snap is explicitly permitted without the risk of incurring an intentional grounding penalty.
* Waiting for the two-minute warning in the NFL and college football, three-minute warning in Canadian football, or one-minute warning in arena football if it is approaching. High school football does not have any of these stoppages, and college football did not adopt the two-minute warning until 2024.
* Committing an offense for which a minor penalty may be called. In some leagues, late in the game, a 10-second runoff is assessed to discourage such tactics.
* Feigning the injury of a player. If this occurs more than once in a game, a timeout may be charged, and/or a penalty may be assessed. In some leagues, if time is called because of an injury, the injured player may be ordered to sit out at least the next play as a way of discouraging the feigning of injury.

====Icing the kicker====

A common practice in gridiron football is to call a timeout right before a potential game-winning or game-tying field goal, a strategy known as &quot;icing the kicker&quot;. In theory, this strategy is based on the presumption that the kicker has prepared himself mentally to make the kick only to have the timeout break his concentration. While this strategy has seemingly worked on occasion, statistics suggest that not only is this an ineffective strategy, but is actually counterproductive because kickers are more likely to make a field goal after a timeout is called—possibly because they have come to expect a timeout to be called, if the opposing team still has one. There have also been times when the tactic has directly backfired; for example, in an NFL game played on November 19, 2007, between the Denver Broncos and Tennessee Titans, Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called a timeout to ice the kicker. It was difficult to hear the whistle and the play continued, with Titans kicker Rob Bironas badly shanking a 56-yard field goal. The play was restarted, this time without a timeout, and the kick was good. Since a team is not allowed to call multiple timeouts between plays, they are prohibited from trying to ice a kicker more than once on the same kick; attempting to do so results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the kicking team 15 yards and an automatic first down. It has only happened once in the NFL, in a 2007 game between the Buffalo Bills and the Washington Redskins, when Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs called a timeout just before Bills kicker Rian Lindell attempted a 51-yard field goal. The kick was good, but Gibbs was awarded the timeout. Gibbs then called a second timeout when Lindell was preparing to kick the ball again, because Gibbs was unaware of the rule. Gibbs was issued an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, which narrowed the attempt from 51 yards to 36 yards out. Lindell made the 36-yard field goal to win the game for the Bills, 18–17.

====Official timeouts====
Game officials also have the authority to call their own time-outs, which unlike the team time-outs are unlimited. Such official time-outs can be used for instant replay reviews, to tend to an injury, to measure the spot of the ball with the chain crew or (in televised contests) to insert television commercials into the telecast.

===Ice hockey===
In ice hockey, each team is allowed one thirty-second time-out per game, which may only be taken during a normal stoppage of play. In the National Hockey League (NHL), only one team is permitted a time out during stoppage. However, in the International Ice Hockey Federation rules, both teams are permitted a time out during the same stoppage, but the second team must notify the referee before the opponent&#x27;s time-out expires.

Since each team has only one time-out, they will often reserve it for special situations, such as sudden changes in momentum of the game, resting players who have been on the ice for an extended period of time, and needing to score a goal near the end of regulation time, allowing time to strategize and rest the team&#x27;s best players.

In the NHL, teams lose their time-out if they unsuccessfully challenge a goaltender interference call, and cannot challenge if they are already without their time-out.

Since the 2017–18 season, teams cannot utilize their time-out after an icing, except for the team who was not charged with the icing. In addition, they retain their timeout after every successful goaltender interference challenge; unsuccessful offside challenges result in a minor penalty for delay of game.

===Team handball===
In team handball, one sixty-second time-out per half per team is allowed. Time-outs are called by the head coach by handing a green time-out card to the match official, and can only be called when the team is in possession of the ball.

===Volleyball===
In volleyball, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) stipulates two 30-second time-outs allowed per team, per set. In FIVB World and Official Competitions, there are two additional 60-second technical time-outs in each set when the leading team reaches the 8th and 16th points, however there is no technical time-out in a tie-breaking set (5th set) (though there is a change of ends at 8 points).

===Water polo===
In water polo, each team is entitled two sixty-second time-outs in regular time, and one extra time-out in extra time. The time-out can only be called if the team is in possession of the ball.

==Criticism==
Time-outs have been criticized for slowing games down and thus diminishing their entertainment value.

<text>Sun Country Airlines is an ultra-low cost airline in the United States. Based at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport with headquarters on airport property, Sun Country operates to about 140 destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The airline also has significant charter operations and is a contract cargo operator for Amazon Air.

== History ==

=== Early years and bankruptcies (1983–2008) ===
Sun Country was incorporated on 2 July 1982. It received its certificate of public necessity and convenience from the Civil Aeronautics Board on January 17, 1983. The company began offering charter service and the first revenue flight was on January 20, 1983 from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas, using a Boeing 727 aircraft leased from Air Florida. The airline&#x27;s original staff consisted of sixteen pilots, sixteen flight attendants, three mechanics and one office person. A number of the original employees had previously worked for Braniff International Airways, which ceased operations on May 12, 1982. The company&#x27;s founder and first President/CEO was Captain Jim Olsen, who also acted as Chief Pilot. His wife, Joan Smith-Olsen, acted as Chief Flight Attendant and Head of Inflight Operations.

In 1988, its headquarters were located on the grounds of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. In 1995, Sun Country began offering scheduled flights from Minneapolis to several major cities throughout the United States. In 2001, the company suspended operations due to financial troubles. In July 2006, the airline was acquired by Petters Group Worldwide and Whitebox Advisors.

Following the replacement of interim CEO Jay Salmen by Stan Gadek, former CFO of AirTran Airways, Sun Country was nearly finished by the major recession of 2008 and the revelation that Petters Group Worldwide was operating a massive financial fraud, a $3.25 billion Ponzi scheme. The airline furloughed 45 of its 156 pilots and scaled back its summer schedule due to rising fuel costs. Sun Country indicated it had hoped to get up to $50 million in loans or other financial help from the state of Minnesota and the airports commission. In September 2008 the carrier reduced, and in some cases eliminated, flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles. It also began charging for the first checked bag. At the end of September 2008, Gadek called for a 50% pay-deferral to all remaining employees. Tom Petters resigned after an FBI probe discovered that the airline had suffered financial fraud on a massive scale. Following this, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time, on October 6, 2008.

=== Rebuilding and Davis brothers ownership (2011–2017) ===
In July 2011, Sun Country was bought out of bankruptcy for $34 million by the Davis family, owners of Cambria, a Minnesota-based countertop company. Marty Davis, CEO of Cambria, became chairman.

In 2015, the Sun Country board hired Zarir Erani as president and CEO. The airline had a net income of $27 million in 2015, followed by a 41% drop to $16 million in 2016.

In July 2017, after more than a year of missed monthly earnings projections, Davis replaced Erani as interim President and CEO, with Erani moving to other duties within the Davis family of companies. Jude Bricker, previously of Allegiant Air, was appointed as CEO one week after Erani stepped down. As part of its strategy, Sun Country had begun to move towards being a &quot;no frills&quot; airline.

=== Apollo Global Management ownership (2017–present) ===
On December 14, 2017, the Davis brothers announced they would be selling the airline to funds affiliated with New York Based Apollo Global Management for an undisclosed amount.

On December 17, 2019, Amazon Air bought a minority stake in Sun Country from Apollo, with plans for the airline to operate cargo flights under the Amazon Air brand. As Sun Country&#x27;s passenger model is heavily leisure focused, this deal is designed to help stabilize revenues during non-peak seasons. In December 2019 Sun Country announced they would begin operating cargo flights for Amazon. Sun Country will initially operate ten cargo jets for Amazon Air. The airline operated their first cargo flight for Amazon in May 2020.

On March 17, 2021, Sun Country became publicly listed and traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker SNCY.

As of June 2024, Sun Country&#x27;s cargo fleet operated under contract with Amazon Air has grown to 12 airframes. On June 20, 2024, Sun Country and Amazon Air announced an extension to their contract out to 2030. Under this new contract, Amazon Air will transfer an additional 8 737-800BCF aircraft to Sun Country, increasing the airline&#x27;s cargo fleet to 20 airframes.

Recent key figures for Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (which include the passenger operations of Sun Country Airlines and its cargo business for Amazon Air) are (years ending December 31):

=== Services ===

Sun Country now offers three variations of economy seats: Best, Exit Row, and Standard.

&quot;Sun Country Rewards&quot;, the airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program, was established in November 2018, and replaced an older program called &quot;Ufly&quot;. In 2023, Sun Country was named the best low cost carrier in North America at the Paris Airshow&#x27;s World Airline Rankings.

<text>The Beechcraft Musketeer is a family of single-engined, low-wing, light aircraft that was produced by Beechcraft. The line includes the Model 19 Musketeer Sport, the Model 23 Musketeer, Custom and Sundowner, the Model 23-24 Musketeer Super III, the retractable gear Model 24R Sierra and the military CT-134 Musketeer.

The Musketeer line was in production from model years 1963 to 1983, during which time a total of 4,366 were produced. The type certificate for the Musketeer family of aircraft has been owned by Hawker Beechcraft since March 26, 2007.

==Development==

===Model 23 Musketeer and Custom===

The first of the line was the Model 23. It was introduced under the &quot;Musketeer&quot; name as a 1963 model at an initial price of $13,300 and was powered by a Lycoming O-320-D2B engine of . The next year this engine was replaced by the Continental IO-346-A engine of . This engine was not a success and was in turn replaced by the Lycoming O-360-A4J engine of starting with the B23 Musketeer Custom of 1968. In 1970 the C23 version was introduced also under the name &quot;Musketeer Custom&quot;. In 1972 the C23 was renamed the &quot;Sundowner&quot;. When properly equipped, the B23 and C23 are approved for limited aerobatics.

A total of 2,331 Beechcraft 23s of all variants were manufactured by the time production was completed 20 years later in 1983.

===Model 19 Musketeer Sport===
The Beech 19 was introduced as a 1966 model year. Despite having a lower model number, it was a later variant and was a lower-powered trainer version of the Model 23. It lacked the 23&#x27;s third side window and had a Lycoming O-320-E2C powerplant of . The Sport was introduced in 1966 with a standard price of $11,500. When properly equipped, the A19, B19, and M19 Sports are approved for limited aerobatics.

The Model 19 was named the &quot;Musketeer Sport&quot; and a total of 922 were built over the 15 years of production which ended with the 1979 model year.

===Model 23-24 Musketeer Super III===

Along with the introduction of the lower-powered Model 19 in 1966, Beechcraft also introduced a higher-powered version of the Model 23 Musketeer and named it the Beechcraft 23–24 Musketeer Super III. This upgraded model, first flown on 19 November 1965, had a Lycoming IO-360 fuel injected powerplant which produced , more than the standard Model 23 Musketeer of that year. This model initially sold for a price of $16,350 in 1966.

In 1966 a single demonstration Model 23-24 was equipped with a constant speed propeller. In succeeding years approximately one third of production aircraft were delivered with the constant speed propeller.

The Super Musketeer typically has a useful load of 1050 to 1080 pounds – giving it one of the highest payloads of four-cylinder, fixed gear, simple single-engined aircraft available. Most Model 23-24s were produced in a four-seat configuration. A very small number were produced with a 4+2 configuration with the baggage area convertible to seat two children. This configuration option was more common on the Sierra models that followed the Model 23-24.

One of the few weaknesses of the Model 23-24 was that it had a simple heat distribution system that provided warm air via the firewall to the area under the instrument panel only. This meant heat to the rear seat passengers was less than optimal. Later aircraft featured increasingly better ducting designs that provided heat to all four seating positions.

The fixed-gear Model 23-24 was produced only between 1966 and 1969. A total of 369 Musketeer Super IIIs were completed before it was superseded by the Model 24 Sierra. These were serial numbered MA-1 to MA-369 and were the only models to have a &quot;MA&quot; serial number, making them easier to distinguish than other members of the Musketeer line. In the last few airframes of the series a new instrument panel with the same &quot;vertical tape&quot; gauges that were used in the early Sierras was introduced. These models were known as the A24 and are not to be confused with the first Sierras, which were designated A24R models. Other than the instrument panel these aircraft were mechanically identical to the earlier A23-24 model.

===Model 24 Sierra===


The Model 23-24 Musketeer Super III proved the utility of the engine in the Musketeer airframe, but the fixed-gear configuration prevented using full advantage of the extra power of the injected Lycoming. The obvious solution was retracting the landing gear and this resulted in the Model 24R.

The Musketeer Super R, A24R in 1970 was the first model year for the new retractable version of the Musketeer to compete with the Piper Arrow.

Renamed the &quot;Sierra&quot;, in 1972. The initial A24R Sierra was powered by a Lycoming IO-360-A1B of and sold for a standard price of $24,950. The Model 24R completed the Beech line between the fixed gear Musketeers and the much larger, faster, more complex and expensive Beechcraft Bonanza.

1974 saw the introduction of the improved B24R Sierra powered by the Lycoming IO-360-A1B6 engine and new propeller variant as a 1974 model year. The improved C24R in 1977 was powered by the same engine and larger propeller. Beech also did an aerodynamic cleanup on the &quot;C&quot; model making it 6 knots faster than the &quot;B&quot; model it replaced in 1977.

Sierra production ended at the same time as the Model 23 Sundowner assembly line was closed up, during the aviation economic downturn of 1983. A total of 744 Sierras were delivered.

The Musketeer design was further developed into a twin-engined aircraft, the Beechcraft Model 76 Duchess.

===CT-134 Musketeer===
The Canadian Forces purchased twenty-four 1971 model B23 Musketeers, with the first CT-134 arriving at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971. The initial batch of CT-134s was replaced in late 1981 with twenty-four 1982 model Beechcraft C23 Sundowners, which were designated by the CF as CT-134A Musketeer II.

==Design==

===Landing gear===

A significant difference between the Musketeer line and other similar light aircraft is the Musketeer&#x27;s landing gear. While the competitive Cessna 172s use spring-steel main gear, the Piper PA-28 Cherokees use oleo struts and the Grumman American AA-5s use fiberglass-sprung main gear, the Musketeer family use a trailing idler link gear system with compressed rubber pucks for shock absorption. This gives the aircraft quite different landing characteristics compared to the competition; light touchdowns are often accompanied by the idler links skipping and producing a landing that is less graceful than anticipated. Nevertheless, with practice, smooth landings are easy to accomplish.

As a result of this type of landing gear design, Beechcraft did not design or offer wheel fairings for the fixed gear models. Several aftermarket manufacturers have designed and tested wheel fairings for Musketeers.

==Operational history==

During their production years the Musketeer family of aircraft were popular trainers and were used by many flying schools. Most Musketeers are now privately owned.

<doc id="1241157" wikidata="Q7288756" url="?curid=1241157" title="Ramagupta">
<text>Ramagupta (IAST: Rāma-gupta; r. c. late 4th century CE), according to the Sanskrit play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, was an emperor of the Gupta dynasty of northern India. The surviving fragments of the play, combined with other literary evidence, suggest that he agreed to surrender his wife Dhruvadevi to a Shaka enemy: However, his brother Chandragupta II killed the Shaka enemy, and later dethroned him, marrying Dhruvadevi.

The official Gupta genealogy does not mention Ramagupta, and therefore, the historicity of the &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; narrative is debated. Several other sources refer to the events mentioned in the play, but these sources do not mention Ramagupta by name, and may be based on the play itself. Three undated inscriptions, written in a variety of the Gupta script and discovered in central India, mention a king called Ramagupta: this seems to attest the existence of a Gupta emperor named Ramagupta, although it does not conclusively prove the historicity of the &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; story. Some coins discovered in central India have also been attributed to Ramagupta, but this attribution has not been unanimously accepted by modern historians.

== Sources ==

Ramagupta&#x27;s name does not appear in the official records of the Gupta dynasty. According to the official Gupta genealogy, Samudragupta&#x27;s successor was Chandragupta II, whose queen was Dhruvadevi. It is possible that the records of Ramagupta&#x27;s successors omit his name from genealogical lists because he was not their ancestor.

Ramagupta is mentioned in the Sanskrit-language play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;. The original text of the play is now lost, but its extracts survive in other works. Several later literary and epigraphic sources corroborate the narrative of &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, although they do not mention Ramagupta by name (see ).

After the extracts of &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; were first discovered by Sylvain Levi and R. Saraswati in 1923, Ramagupta&#x27;s historicity became a matter of debate among historians. Some scholars, including Levi, dismissed &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; as unreliable for the purposes of history. Others, such as RD Banerji and Henry Heras argued that the additional literary evidence was too strong to dismiss Ramagupta as a fictional character, and hoped that his existence would be proved by discovery of his coins in future. Subsequently, some scholars such as K. D. Bajpai attributed a few copper coins discovered in central India to Ramagupta, but others, such as D. C. Sircar disputed this attribution (see Coinage) below. Later, three Jain statue inscriptions referring to &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; Ramagupta were discovered at Durjanpur, and have been cited as proof for the existence of the king mentioned in the &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; (see Inscriptions below).

== Reign ==

Based on the surviving passages of &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; and other supporting evidence, modern scholars theorize that Ramagupta was the elder son and successor of the Gupta emperor Samudragupta.

According to the play, Ramagupta decided to surrender his wife Dhruva-devi (or Dhruva-svamini) to a Shaka enemy, but his younger brother Chandragupta went to the enemy camp disguised as the queen, and killed the enemy. According to the &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; passage quoted in Bhoja&#x27;s &quot;Shringara-Prakasha&quot;, the enemy camp was located at Alipura. Bana&#x27;s &quot;Harsha-charita&quot; calls the place &quot;Aripura&quot; (literally &quot;enemy&#x27;s city&quot;); one manuscript of &quot;Harsha-charita&quot; calls the place &quot;Nalinapura&quot;.

The identity of Ramagupta&#x27;s &quot;Shaka&quot; (IAST: Śaka) enemy is not certain. Proposed identifications include:

* Historian V. V. Mirashi identified him with the Kushan king who ruled in Punjab, and who is referred to as &quot;Devaputra-Shahi-Shanushahi&quot; in Samudragupta&#x27;s Allahabad Pillar inscription.
* Historian A. S. Altekar identified him with Piro, a son of Kidara I, who controlled western and central Punjab. Altekar theorized that Piro invaded eastern Punjab, and Ramagupta attempted to check his advance, leading to a war.

Based on the Jain statue inscriptions (see #Inscriptions below), historian Tej Ram Sharma speculates that Ramagupta may have adopted &quot;a peaceful style of life&quot; after his humiliation by the Shaka enemy, which may explain his inclination towards Jainism.

Later, Chandragputa appears to have killed Ramagupta and married Dhruvadevi, who is mentioned as Chandragupta&#x27;s queen in the Gupta records.

== Historicity ==
The theory that Ramagupta was a historical person is supported by the following points:

* Inscriptions attributed to Ramagputa have been discovered in central India (see below). These inscriptions mention a king called Ramagupta who bore the imperial title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. Moreover, the inscriptions are in the Gupta Brahmi script of 4th-5th centuries CE, which proves that Ramagupta was a historical Gupta emperor.
* Dhruvadeva and Chandragupta, the two other main characters of the play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, are known to be historical persons. The official records of the Gupta dynasty mention Chandragupta II as an emperor. Dhruvadevi is attested by her royal seal which describes her as the wife of Chandragupta and the mother of Govindagupta.
* The Eran inscription of Samudragupta appears to mention that his queen Datta-devi had many sons and grandsons, although this cannot be said with certainty because the inscription is mutilated.
* In the official Gupta genealogy, the kings are described as &quot;meditating on the feet&quot; of their fathers. However, in a departure from this convention, Chandragupta II is described as having been &quot;accepted by his father&quot; in his Mathura stone pillar inscription as well as Bihar and Bhitari inscriptions of Skandagupta. Scholars who believe the play to have a historical basis argue that this is a covert way of stating that his accession to the throne was contested.
* Several later texts and inscriptions (see ) refer to the episode mentioned in the &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, although these sources may be based on the play itself, and therefore, cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence corroborating the play&#x27;s historicity.

=== Inscriptions ===

Two stone statues of Jain tirthankaras, discovered at Durjanpur (or Durjanpura) near Vidisha, bear inscriptions that mention &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; Ramagupta; the partially-damaged inscription on another similar statue also appears to mention his name. The statues were discovered while clearing a field with a bulldozer, and were partially damaged by the bulldozer.

Based on the reconstructed text, all three inscriptions appear to contain same text except the name of the tirthankara. They state that emperor Ramagupta caused the statues to be built at the behest of a mendicant. The mendicant was named Chella Kshamana or Chelu-kshamana (IAST: Celū-kṣamaṇa), who was a son Golakyanti and a pupil of &quot;Acharya&quot; Sarppasena-kshamana, who in turn, was a pupil&#x27;s pupil of Chandra-kshamana.

These inscriptions do not mention that Ramagupta belonged to the Gupta dynasty, and do not mention any date. However, following arguments can be made to date them to the 4th century, and to support the identification of the Ramagupta mentioned in these inscriptions as a Gupta emperor:

* According to epigraphist G. S. Gai, who edited the inscriptions, the inscriptions feature the so-called southern or western variety of the Gupta script: the alphabet clearly resembles the alphabet of the Eran inscription of Samudragupta (who must have been Ramagupta&#x27;s predecessor) and the Sanchi inscription of Chandragupta II (who must have been Ramagupta&#x27;s successor). The medial &#x27;i&#x27; character is different from the one featured in the Sanchi inscriptions, but such a character can also be found in earlier inscriptions, such as the Nandsa-Yupa inscriptions of the 3rd century. Thus, on palaeographic basis, the Ramagupta inscriptions can be assigned to the 4th century CE.
* According to Gai, the sculptural features and styles of the statues also suggest that they belong to the 4th century CE. The &quot;prabhavali&quot; (halo) is not as developed and stylized as in the 5th century Buddha images from Sanchi. The pedestals of the statues feature a &quot;chakra&quot; at the centre, instead of the characteristic &quot;lanchana&quot;s (traditional symbols) associated with the tirthankaras, which suggests that the images belong to an &quot;early stage in the development of the Jaina iconography&quot;.
* &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; is an imperial title, which indicates that Ramagupta was a historical Gupta emperor.

However, according to another theory, the Ramagupta of the Durjanpur inscriptions is a later Gupta king, not the brother of Chandragupta II. Historian D. C. Sircar has dated these records to a later period, based on a comparison of letters and signs that occur in these inscriptions and the Sanchi inscriptions of Chandragupta II.

=== Coinage ===

A few copper coins, bearing the legend &quot;Ramaguta&quot; (Prakrit form of &quot;Ramagupta&quot;) on the obverse, and the figure of a lion or a garuda on the reverse, have been found at Eran and Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh. Some scholars have attributed these coins to the Gupta ruler Ramagupta, but others believe him to be a distinct, local ruler. Since Garuda was the emblem of the imperial Gupta dynasty, numismatist K. D. Bajpai asserted that these coins were indeed issued by the Gupta emperor Ramagupta. Bajpai speculated that Samudragupta appointed his son Ramagupta as a governor of the eastern Malwa region in central India; Ramagupta was forced to stay there even after his father&#x27;s death because of the war with the Shakas, and the events depicted in &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot; happened there.

However, historian D. C. Sircar doesn&#x27;t find Bajpai&#x27;s theory convincing, and states that the issuer of these coins may have been a local chief of imitated Gupta coinage after the decline of the Gupta dynast in the late 5th century CE. Sircar points out that a non-Gupta ruler named Harigupta is known to have issued copper coins that feature a garuda, and imitate the gold coins of Chandragupta II. Coins of another such imitator, named Indragupta, have been discovered at Kumhrar. Sircar also notes that other Gupta emperors are known to have issued gold coins, but no gold coins issued by Ramagupta have been discovered.

<text>Wanstead () is a London Underground station in Wanstead in the London Borough of Redbridge, east London. It is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Leytonstone and Redbridge stations. The station is located in Travelcard Zone 4. It opened on 14 December 1947 as an extension of the Central line to form the new part of the Hainault loop.

== History ==
The extension of the Central line eastwards from Liverpool Street was first proposed in 1935 by the London Passenger Transport Board. The station at Wanstead George Green would be one of three stations in Tube tunnel between Leytonstone and Newbury Park.

Construction of the station began in the mid-1930s, but was delayed by the onset of World War II. The incomplete tunnels between Wanstead and Gants Hill to the east were used for munitions production by Plessey between 1942 and 1945. The station was finally opened on 14 December 1947. The building, like the other two below ground stations on the branch, was designed by architect Charles Holden. It kept its original wooden escalator until 2003, one of the last Tube stations to do so.

The station has been extensively refurbished since 2006, including the replacement of the original platform wall tiling, which had become badly damaged.

According to rumours, the site of William Penn&#x27;s Home in Wanstead was on that of the station.

==Connections==

The station is served by London Buses routes 66, 101, 145, 308, W12, W13 and W14, and also by night routes N8 and N55.

<text>State Route 118 (SR 118) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs west to east through Ventura and Los Angeles counties. It travels from State Route 126 at the eastern edge of Ventura immediately northwest of Saticoy, then through Saticoy, in Ventura County east to Interstate 210 near Lake View Terrace in Los Angeles. SR 118 crosses the Santa Susana Pass and the northern rim of the San Fernando Valley along its route.

==Route description==

SR 118 has two distinguishable sections, which connect at the intersection with State Route 23. The western section of SR 118 goes through the more rural areas of Ventura County. SR 118 begins at an intersection with SR 126 in Ventura as Wells Road and heads southeast, crossing the Santa Clara River as Los Angeles Avenue and intersecting SR 232 in unincorporated Ventura County. The highway continues southeast before intersecting Santa Clara Avenue, where Los Angeles Avenue turns east and passes north of Camarillo. In the community of Somis, SR 118 intersects SR 34. The road continues into Moorpark, where it intersects SR 23 and runs concurrently with that road. After about 1.25 miles, SR 118 and SR 23 come to a freeway interchange, where SR 118 continues north, and SR 23 continues south.

The eastern section is an urban freeway that starts in the cities of Moorpark and Simi Valley, and ends in Los Angeles. The SR 118 freeway initially travels north, but quickly turns east, passing near Moorpark College, before entering the Simi Valley city limits. SR 118 continues through Simi Valley before entering Corriganville Regional Park and crossing into Los Angeles County and the Los Angeles city limits. The freeway has an HOV lane between here and Interstate 5. In Los Angeles, SR 118 passes through Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park before passing through Chatsworth and interchanging with SR 27. SR 118 subsequently goes through Porter Ranch and Granada Hills before intersecting with I-405 and I-5. Following this, SR 118 goes through Pacoima before terminating at an interchange with the Foothill Freeway.

SR 118 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 118 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The freeway portion of Route 118 between Moorpark and Lake View Terrace was originally named the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway before it was designated as the Ronald Reagan Freeway in 1994. It was renamed in honor of Ronald Reagan, the 33rd Governor of California and the 40th President of the United States, due to the location of his presidential library in Simi Valley.

==History==

SR 118 used to extend past I-210 on Foothill Boulevard through Sunland-Tujunga, La Crescenta and La Cañada, then across the Arroyo Seco into Pasadena, where SR 118 ran on Lincoln Avenue and Fair Oaks Avenue, ending at Colorado Boulevard (US 66 Alternate). The original routing across the Arroyo Seco ran along La Cañada Verdugo Road (now Oak Grove Drive), which crossed the arroyo along the crest of Devil&#x27;s Gate Dam. In 1957, the first segment of the Foothill Freeway was completed between Montana and Cañada Streets in Pasadena and Foothill Blvd and Michigan Avenue in La Cañada. SR 118 ran along this short freeway until 1974, when the current Foothill Freeway alignment over the Arroyo Seco was completed further to the south. SR 118 was then truncated to its current terminus with I-210 near San Fernando.

Before the freeway was built, the route went through Simi Valley on Los Angeles Avenue and Kuehner Drive, then crossed into the San Fernando Valley on Santa Susana Pass Road. The eastern segment used Devonshire Street through the San Fernando Valley, then cut through San Fernando along Brand and Maclay Streets before joining Foothill Boulevard in Sylmar. During the 1932 Summer Olympics, it hosted part of the road cycling event. The SR 118 freeway began construction in 1968 and the last section of freeway opened in 1979. The segment of freeway between Balboa Boulevard and Tampa Avenue was one of the last freeway segments to be built in the Los Angeles area. As a result of the Northridge earthquake in January 1994, a section of the highway between I-405 and I-210 was closed for over one month while damage to an overpass was repaired. The Porter Ranch Drive interchange is relatively new; before it was constructed, that interchange connected to a closed Winnetka Avenue and a Park and Ride lot.

Route 118 from Route 23 to Route 210 was named the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 145, Chapter 185 in 1970. In December 1994, the portion of Route 118 constructed to freeway standards was renamed The Ronald Reagan Freeway. The original proposal for this name was introduced by Willie Brown on August 30, 1994 and amended August 31, 1994, as State Assembly Concurrent Resolution 156, however this version of the bill died on the desk in November 1994. The name was reintroduced by State Senators Lockyer, Maddy, and Wright as State Senate Resolution 7, amended and enrolled December 5, 1994. Since it was neither a concurrent resolution nor a joint resolution, it was not filed with the Secretary of State. The rationale for choosing this name for State Route 118 is that the western end of the highway, at the time the bill was passed, is very close to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

There is an additional unconstructed segment of SR 118, defined in 1959 in the California Streets and Highways Code, extending from its current terminus with I-210 to a planned SR 249, located within the Angeles National Forest. This appears to have been roughly planned to run primarily along Big Tujunga Canyon between Foothill Boulevard and Los Angeles County Route N3, Angeles Forest Highway, which is the current traversable routing for unconstructed SR 249.

<text>HMS &quot;Hecate&quot; (A137) was a Royal Navy deep ocean survey vessel of the . She was present at the &quot;presentation of fleet colours&quot; review in Torbay on 29 July 1969. The ship was decommissioned in 1990.
==Design and construction==
The &quot;Hecla&quot; class were designed as combined hydrographic and oceanographic survey ships, built to merchant ship standards and of similar design to . She was laid down at Yarrow Shipbuilders&#x27; Scotstoun shipyard on 26 October 1964, was launched on 31 March 1965 and was commissioned on 20 December 1965. She had the pennant number A137.

&quot;Hecate&quot; was long, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was light and full load, with a gross tonnage of 2,898. She had diesel-electric propulsion, with three Paxman Ventura 12-cylinder diesel engines rated at powering two electric motors, rated at a total of and driving one propeller shaft, giving a speed of . She had a range of at a speed of and at . The ship had a complement of 127 officers and other ranks. She was fitted with a hangar and helideck aft to allow operation of a single Westland Wasp helicopter, while two surveying launches were carried.

== History ==
On 21 April 1971, two launches attached to HMS &quot;Hecate&quot; were towed out to sea and bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army while the vessels were moored at Baltimore, Republic of Ireland. One of the launches, &quot;Stork&quot;, was wrecked, while the other boat, &quot;Puffin&quot;, survived with minor damage. HMS &quot;Hecate&quot; was carrying out a hydrographic survey in collaboration with the government of the Republic.

In the mid-1970s HMS &quot;Hecate&quot; was in the Persian Gulf surveying the entrance areas in the event of conflicts while based in Bandar Abbas, Iran.

In November 1981 while on a routine visit to Nantes, France, an attempt was made to sink the vessel using a bomb placed on the hull by divers. The detonator went off in the early hours of the morning, but the explosive failed to detonate. calling themselves &quot;the Bobby Sands Committee&quot; later claimed responsibility. Hecate was undamaged and conducted North Atlantic surveys for the next 4 months, visiting Gibraltar, Tangiers, Madeira and Lisbon.

In June 1982, during the Falklands War, while her sister ship were used as hospital ships, &quot;Hecate&quot; was painted grey and given an armament of two 20 mm guns and Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles. On 23 July, after the ceasefire had ended the fighting, &quot;Hecate&quot; was sent to the South Atlantic to relieve as Ice Patrol Ship while &quot;Endurance&quot; returned to Britain for a refit. &quot;Hecate&quot; conducted patrols and surveys in the South Atlantic. A survey was made at Mare Harbour in East Falkland, which later became the port facilities for RAF Mount Pleasant. A survey was also made of the Bay of Isles, South Georgia. &quot;Hecate&quot; visited British Antarctic Survey bases and spent Christmas in Grytviken, South Georgia, where the crew attended a candlelit Christmas mass in the settlement&#x27;s old whaling church. The New Year was spent at the Falkland Islands before &quot;Hecate&quot; became the first Royal Navy ship to visit South America following the hostilities. &quot;Hecate&quot; embarked a Chilean pilot at Punta Arenas before sailing to Talcahuano, Chile via the Patagonian Channel. Following a brief visit, &quot;Hecate&quot; took passage through the Panama Canal for a four-day visit to Antigua. &quot;Hecate&quot; returned to the UK in February, 1983.

<text>SULFA, short for Surrendered ULFA, refers to former members of the United Liberation Front of Assam that have surrendered to the Indian government.

Since 1990, the government of India has been attempting to capture members of ULFA. In 1992, a large group of high-ranking leaders and members surrendered to government authorities, which was the first time ex-ULFA members were referred to as &quot;SULFA&quot;. However, those that surrendered were disarmed by the government, leaving them without a means of defence against retaliation from their ex-associates. They were also offered bank loans to start a new life, in return for providing information to the government about the ULFA.

<doc id="1241165" wikidata="Q45206" url="?curid=1241165" title="Toba Tek Singh District">
<text>Toba Tek Singh District (, ) is a district of Faisalabad Division in the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is located between 30°33&#x27; to 31°2&#x27; Degree north latitudes and 72°08&#x27; to 72°48&#x27; Degree longitudes. It became a separate district in 1982.

==Etymology==
The city and district is named after a Sikh religious figure Tek Singh. Legend has it that Tek Singh, a kind-hearted man served water and provided shelter to the worn out and thirsty travelers passing by a small pond (&quot;Toba&quot; in Punjabi) which eventually was called Toba Tek Singh, and the surrounding settlement acquired the same name. There is also a park here named after Singh.

==History==

=== British Raj ===
Toba Tek Singh was developed by the British toward the end of the 19th Century when a canal system was built. People from all over the Punjab (from the current Pakistani and Indian Punjab) moved there as farmlands were allotted to them. Most of the people who migrated there belonged to Lahore, Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts.
The Imperial Gazetteer of India described the tehsil of Toba Tek Singh as follows:

Tehsil of the new Faisalabad District, Punjab, lying between 30°50&#x27; and 31°23&#x27; N. and 72° 20&#x27; and 72°54&#x27; E., with an area of . The population in 1906 was 148,984. It contains 342 villages, including Toba Tek Singh (population, 1,874), the headquarters, and Gojra (2,589), an important grain market on the Wazirabad-Khanewal branch of the North-Western Railway. The land revenue in 1905-6 amounted to Rupees 470,000. The tehsil consists of a level plain, wholly irrigated by the Chenab Canal. The soil, which is very fertile in the east of the tehsil, becomes sandy towards the west. The boundaries of the tehsil were somewhat modified at the time of the formation of the new District of Faisalabad (formerly called Lyallpur). 

The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Toba Tek Singh District.

=== After independence ===
During the 1970s, when many Pakistani cities were renamed to change names given after British Rulers to their original or native names, or to names more acceptable to the local population (for example, Montgomery was renamed to its old original name Sahiwal), Toba Tek Singh remained one of the very few cities to maintain its original name mainly because of noble reputation of Tek Singh. In 1982, Toba Tek Singh, formerly a subdivision, was separated from Faisalabad District and became a separate district.

in 1970, the historical Kisan Conference saw 200,000 Kisans (peasants) and progressive people from the whole country gathered in Toba Tek Singh. The conference had a great impact on the political history of Pakistan and led to the land reforms during the regime of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

== Demography ==
Toba Tek Singh is located in central Punjab and occupies 3252 square kilometers and is made up of large areas of lowlands that flood frequently during the rainy season; the floods originate from the Ravi River that runs along the southern and southeastern borders. During the British Raj, Toba Tek Singh had a sizeable Hindu and Sikh population, much of which migrated to India after the partition in 1947, while many Muslim refugees from present-day India settled in the Toba Tek Singh District.

As of the 2023 census, Toba Tek Singh district has 393,896 households and a population of 2,524,044. The district has a sex ratio of 105.49 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 71.38%: 76.37% for males and 66.13% for females. 621,491 (24.62% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. 563,525 (22.33%) live in urban areas.



At the time of the 2023 census, 96.20% of the population spoke Punjabi and 2.48% Urdu as their first language.

==Toba Tek Singh People==
As per University of Agriculture, Faisalabad research, after Karachi, Toba Tek Singh is the second hub of poultry products in Pakistan. Farmers grow orange (kinoo) gardens and have a major role in the export of oranges from Pakistan. Many Toba people are overseas Pakistanis and these make a major contribution to the Pakistani economy.

== Administration ==
The district of Toba Tek Singh is administratively subdivided into four tehsils and 82 Union Council.

The district is represented in the National Assembly by three elected MNAs who represent the following constituencies:

The district is represented in the provincial assembly by seven elected MPAs who represent the following constituencies:

<text>State Route 126 (SR 126) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that serves Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The route runs from U.S. Route 101 in Ventura to Interstate 5 at the Castaic Junction-Santa Clarita border through the Santa Clara River Valley. The highway is an important connector highway in Ventura County, and serves as an alternate route into the Santa Clarita Valley, and (via Interstate 5) the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and the High Desert of Antelope Valley.

==Route description==

SR 126 generally follows the Santa Clara River through the valley, passing through the towns of Fillmore and Santa Paula. The freeway portion of the highway, known as the Santa Paula Freeway, begins in Ventura at U.S. Route 101. It proceeds northeast through the city, interchanging with the western end of SR 118 at a grade-separated interchange. SR 126 then passes through areas of agriculture, orchards, and the Saticoy Oil Field to its northeast, continuing through Santa Paula, where it intersects SR 150, and the freeway portion terminates at Hallock Drive. SR 126 continues as a highway thereafter, known as Telegraph Road. This section extends through Fillmore as Ventura Street, where SR 126 meets SR 23. Following this, SR 126 as Telegraph Road encounters the community of Buckhorn, as well as the edge of Piru and the important historical Rancho Camulos.

The stretch of SR 126 between Santa Paula and the Los Angeles County line has seen an unusually high amount of traffic fatalities and other injurious accidents. Head-on collisions were very frequent on the older, curvy, two-laned sections, earning this portion of the road its nickname, &quot;Blood Alley&quot;. An article from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1996, noted 34 fatalities between 1990 and 1994. Though the highway has since been improved in most areas, traffic fatalities are still quite common.

In Los Angeles County, SR 126 is known as Henry Mayo Drive. The highway continues east to an interchange with I-5. At this interchange the SR 126 designation terminates, and the road continues into Santa Clarita as Newhall Ranch Road.

SR 126 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 126 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

==History==
===Original plans===
In 1958, the freeway was originally planned to follow the northern banks of the Santa Clara River, connecting US 101 to US 99 (I-5 today) and US 6 (SR 14 today) through what is now Santa Clarita. In the mid-1960s, construction of the 4-lane freeway began immediately northeast of Oxnard at US 101 and immediately east of Santa Clarita at US 6.

===Freeway revolts===
In the face of anti-development pressure from Ventura County citizens, and suffering from severe financial problems as a result of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the late-1970s California tax revolt, Caltrans abandoned its plans. The freeway, which by then had reached Santa Paula, terminates at a four-way intersection immediately east of the city. From there, a 4-lane undivided highway continues on toward I-5. The eastern approach of SR 126 was abandoned midway through the interchange&#x27;s construction at SR 14. Two long on-ramps and a large graded plateau are all that remain of the approach.

The only remnants of these plans are the two long ramps to and from SR 14 at the Sierra Highway interchange (exit 6A) in Santa Clarita, and Newhall Ranch Road, a six to eight-lane divided local road that continues from the current terminus of SR 126 at Interstate 5 and roughly follows the original 1958 route to just past Bouquet Canyon Road on the north side of the Santa Clara River. Newhall Ranch Road changes to Golden Valley Road 1.75 miles east of Bouquet Canyon Road, and continues to SR 14, roughly one mile south of the original planned terminus of SR 126.

===1984 Summer Olympics===
The 1984 Summer Olympics Organizing Committee was allowed to close the freeway portion between Ventura and Santa Paula for cycling practice for the 100 Kilometer Team Trials on two consecutive Thursdays.

===Cross Valley Connector===
On March 27, 2010, the City of Santa Clarita completed the decade-long Cross Valley Connector (CVC) project, which sought to connect SR 126 directly to SR 14 roughly along the original route alignment. The city-maintained route is named Newhall Ranch Road on the western segment, and Golden Valley Road on the eastern segment. The two segments meet at the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and Golden Valley Road, where Golden Valley Road turns and continues northeast.

===Commerce Center Drive===
In 2017, Caltrans began construction along the eastern end of SR 126, upgrading the 6-lane divided highway to an 8-lane freeway. A new interchange replaced the traffic signal at Commerce Center Drive. The interchange is sequentially numbered as exit 13, as exit 12 is away in Santa Paula near the eastern end of the Santa Paula Freeway section of SR 126. It is the only known instance of a sequential numbered exit in California. If the state&#x27;s normal exit numbering system had properly been applied, Commerce Center Drive should have been numbered as exit 39 instead, as it is approximately away from SR 126&#x27;s western terminus.

<doc id="1241200" wikidata="Q4678300" url="?curid=1241200" title="Ada Semantic Interface Specification">
<text>The [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) is a layered, open architecture providing vendor-independent access to the Ada Library Environment. It allows for the static analysis of Ada programs and libraries. It is an open, published interface library that consists of the Ada environment and their tools and applications.

As explained by the ASIS Working Group:

&quot;“ASIS is an interface between an Ada environment as defined by ISO/IEC 8652:1995 (the Ada Reference Manual) and any tool requiring information from this environment”&quot; (SIGAda, 2020)

It is exclusively used for programming language applications and static analysis on Ada programs, therefore giving the relevant information and access to Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) and applicable developers. ASIS also has the ability in utilizing the relevant software engineering tools whilst also embodying an easy understanding of the complexities of an Ada environment display. In addition, it provides procedures, functions and relevant information that can be significantly used to access exclusive information found in reference manuals and the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Which in return will advance ASIS to the capability of being portable to transport and retain information and terminology of Ada tools.

“ASIS consists of 21 packages, 2 are optional and within these packages define 349 queries”. ASIS will also consist of a package which within it includes child packages that include “Errors Compilation units, Ada environments, implementation, exceptions, elements, iterator, declarations, expressions, clauses, definitions, statements, text and Ids”.

Overall ASIS is simply a straightforward way to collect data from an ADA program and increases any of the Ada tools portability.

== Features of ASIS ==
Ada Semantic Interphase Specification under the ISO/IEC 8652 Ada 95 Reference Manual (Ada Language Referencing Manual, 1994) is defined as an interface amidst an Aria environment and other tools requiring information from the Aria environment.

Features of ASIS based tools could include:

* high quality code analysis
* automated code monitors
* browsers
* call tree tools
* code reformators
* coding standards compliance tools
* correctness verifiers
* debuggers
* dependency tree analysis tools
* design tools
* document generators
* metrics tools
* reverse engineering tools
* re-engineering tools
* style checkers
* test tools
* timing estimators
* translators

ASIS also provides limited approaches to the structural and semantic information that are found in the Ada library, it aims to provide and produce information that is similar if not exactly the same semantic level as the definition of Ada. This will greatly assist in providing the exact same definitions and information of the Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language (LRM) to interested individuals and clients (Ehrenfried).

===Main abstractions===
In ASIS, there are 3 main abstractions that exist in the Ada &#x27;private&#x27; types. This consists of Context, Compilation_Unit and Element. While there are additional types of abstractions also involved but the 3 mentioned are the fundamentals.
Context
The Context abstraction of ASIS consists of the definitions, terms and conditions that are available in ASIS enquiries. It is also used as a way and logical handle for the Ada environment.
Compilation_Unit
The Compilation Unit is also a logical handle for the Ada environment. This abstraction also defines the properties and characteristics which are further seen in the Ada Reference Manual. It uses Ada&#x27;s programming language implementation to convey compilation units through ASIS. As said by Adacore;

&quot;An ASIS codice_1 provides the ‘black-box’ view of a compilation unit, considering the unit as a whole. It may be decomposed into ASIS codice_2and then analyzed in ‘white-box’ fashion.&quot;

Examplies of these properties given can include:

# Time of last update
# Name of object containing unit&#x27;s source text

Element
Comparably the Element abstraction is also a logical handle to the Compilation Unit discussed above, this can either be explicit or implicit.

== Structure of ASIS ==
The ASIS application structure can be categorized into 3 categories; Setup ASIS Analysis, Process Compilation Units and Complete ASIS Analysis. This structure is to help in supporting various code analysis programs that appear in the Ada programming language.

=== Setup ASIS analysis ===
The first step to the structure of ASIS analysis is to set it up efficiently. During this step, various tasks and programs are initialised and established. For example, as identified by William Colket (1999), this step is when the ASIS program initializes ASIS, establishes ASIS context and state object, associates the ASIS Context with the analysis, opens the ASIS context, and performs any pre-processing needed to support the ASIS analysis. The first step is generally to get the ASIS analysis up and running and be ready to use efficiently and effectively.

=== Process compilation units ===
The setup is then followed by &quot;processing compilation units&quot;, during this time is when elements are sampled and analysed to fit into the ASIS Context that had been opened and associated with at the beginning of the ASIS structure. During this step, it mainly processes most of the ASIS application elements in correlation with the ASIS context, it also has the added capability to perform compilation units before and after processing has been done.

=== Complete ASIS analysis ===
The last and final stage of the ASIS structure is the completion of ASIS analysis. This is where everything is finalised and reviewed to perform any post processing to the ASIS analysis. The ASIS context is also closed and disassociated and ASIS is eventually finalised.

=== Design criteria ===
As ASIS continues to evolve similarly so does the evolution of its design criteria. The criteria for how ASIS can be designed can be sorted into 9 different categories; wide acceptance, transportability, uniformity and cohesiveness, implementability, state of technology, extensibility, ada terminology and style, performance and minimal set of interfaces.

==== 1. Wide acceptance ====
It must be designed according to this criterion so that a wide variety of tools can be used for ASIS. Designing it with this allows the interface library to be more flexible and available for tools across other platforms, Ada vendor implementations. It also allows for it to reduce training time for tool users and developers.

==== 2. Transportability ====
ASIS must also be designed so it has the capability to be transferred from one computer to another computer or another environment to another.

==== 3. Uniformity and cohesiveness ====
It should also be consistent in properties, concepts, types and operations but also be kept as a simple and coherent operation.

==== 4. Implementability ====
ASIS is also criticised so that it is &quot;implementable by any Ada Compiler Vendor with a reasonable effort&quot;. As well as maintaining consistency throughout the whole program.

==== 5. State of technology ====
The state of technology must always be updated and advanced to ensure no issues take place. Additionally, it should be ensured that all possible variations and versions of ASIS will be coherent and efficient.

==== 6. Extensibility ====
&quot;It should not preclude extensions that will make use of the ASIS design model and abstractions.&quot;

==== 7. Ada terminology and style ====
ASIS should also adapt to the terms and conditions of style and definitions to the Ada Reference Manual.

==== 8. Performance ====
&quot;ASIS design must allow for efficiency from both the client view and implementation view&quot;

==== 9. Minimal set of interfaces ====
&quot;It should allow clients to implement additional layered interfaces using the primitive operations provided.&quot;

== Uses of ASIS ==

=== ASIS for GNAT ===
ASIS has been used by Adacore to implement an ASIS standard in the utilisation of ASIS-for-GNAT applications. ASIS can be used for GNAT through typical applications such as: “Static Analysis (property verification), Code instrumentation, Design and document generation tools, Metric testing or timing tools, Dependency Tree Analysis Tools, Type Dictionary Generators, Coding standards Enforcement Tools, Language Translators, Quality Assessment Tools, Source Browsers and Formatters and Syntax Directed Editors” (ASIS for GNAT).

This methodology has also been used to develop numerous tools with the assistance of ASIS including;

# gnatelim
# gnatstub
# gnatcheck
# gnatpp 
# gnatmetric.

=== ASIS as insulator ===
Pace Drury (1999) utilises ASIS to create a code for his project named ‘SIDPERS-3’ where the code is used to identify intimate details and variations seen in Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) generated from data base interaction Drury used ASIS for his project where ASIS created a new layer of Ada code which successfully insulated the software developer from the same generated Ada code specifics.

Having written such a difficult code called ‘generate_db_support_code’ which majorly consisted of Ada code, the aim of it were to open 2 files, examine contents and create two new files based on the prior 2 files. ASIS had been used to examine the structure of the code efficiently, making it easier to store and link to a list containing Ada language. ASIS coherently completes what is asked to do and successfully gains constant and secure access to the data base information which meets the project’s needs.

=== AdaControl ===
AdaControl is a free (GMGPL) tool that detects the use of various kinds of constructs in Ada programs. Its uses include checking of coding standards, exploring the use of Ada features, making statistics, and more. It exploits all the power of ASIS, and can be considered as the most typical ASIS application.

<doc id="1241225" wikidata="Q3181640" url="?curid=1241225" title="John Greenwood (composer)">
<text>John Danforth Herman Greenwood (26 June 1889 – 15 April 1975), was an English composer best known for his film scores.

==Education and early career==
Greenwood was the son of New Zealander Alfred Greenwood (1842–1912) and his English-born wife Ottilie Rose Minna (1855–1932) née Schweitzer. He was named after his grandfathers: Herman Schweitzer, a Prussian born analytical chemist; and Dr. John Danforth Greenwood (1803–1890) from Sussex, England, a pioneering New Zealand physician and educationist, who had emigrated to New Zealand in 1842 after retiring from medicine due to ill health. Greenwood was born in London. He learned piano and viola from his parents and at 18 entered the Royal College of Music to study viola and horn, as well as composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. While there he won the Grove scholarship and Arthur Sullivan composition awards. For a short period he taught at Brighton and Hove Grammar School, and then made his living as a pianist, horn and viola player in various orchestras as well as conducting at the Queen&#x27;s Hall and in the provinces.

During the First World War Greenwood was a conscientious objector. At that time he was living at 39, Hillcrest Road, Acton Hill. Greenwood married Winifred Margaret Hicks in 1917 and a son, Alfred Michael Greenwood, was born a year later. 

==Composer==
Greenwood&#x27;s early concert works had their first performances from the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra under Henry Wood in the early 1920s. But he quickly became involved with writing music for the cinema, composing and editing music for silent films from the 1920s onwards. In 1929 he wrote a new score for the part-talkie film &quot;To What Red Hell&quot;. From the 1930s until the mid-1950s he worked on around 50 films, from &quot;Man of Aran&quot; (1934) to &quot;Grand National Night&quot; (1953). While he no doubt gained considerable satisfaction from these compositions – and access to a large audience – there were also frustrations as the film editing process frequently required the removal or addition of passages of music quite regardless of the overall form and themes of the piece.

Whether his compositions of incidental theatre music for Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (as staged by J.B. Fagan) were intrinsically more satisfying is not known. A &quot;Fantasy&quot; was extracted from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and performed separately.

His film credits also include scores for documentaries such as &quot;Berth 24&quot; (1950), portraying the life of the Hull docks, and &quot;The Lake District&quot; (1954), with narration by Michael Redgrave. His march &quot;The Eighth Army&quot; (from the film &quot;The Nine Men&quot;) written with Eric Coates, was recorded on 78.

The concert works, composed in parallel with his work for film and theatre, are now entirely forgotten. &quot;Salute to Gustav Holst&quot; was premiered at the Sir Henry Wood Promenade Concerts in 1936, conducted by the composer. His setting of &quot;Psalm 150&quot; for chorus and orchestra was broadcast in May 1936, conducted by Adrian Boult. On 24 January 1938 Constant Lambert conducted the BBC Orchestra in the first performance and broadcast of Greenwood&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Movement&quot;.

The Piano Quintet, composed around 1940, was performed by the Aeolian String Quartet and Kyla Greenbaum on 15 October 1953 at Queen Mary Hall, Great Russell Street, as part of a chamber concert that also included the String Quartet No 2 (1928) and the Flute Sonata (1943). On 14 September 1956 his Viola Concerto received its world premiere at the Proms, with Watson Forbes as the soloist, conducted by John Hollingsworth. 

The composer&#x27;s archives, held at McMaster University, contain documentation (including some manuscripts) of two symphonies, three piano sonatas and two orchestral ballet suites (&quot;The Silver Harlequin&quot;, 1917 and &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, 1953).

==Later life==
By the 1930s he was living at Roedean, Brighton. During the Second World War he worked on the staff of the BBC European Service as Assistant Music Supervisor. By the early 1950s, as his work on films drew to a close, he was living at Greenwoods, North End, Ditchling in Sussex. In 1969 his address was Guntsfield, 32 Beacon Road, Ditchling. He died at Ditchling, aged 85.

<text>Sir William Dobell (24 September 189913 May 1970) was an Australian portrait and landscape artist of the 20th century. Dobell won the Archibald Prize, Australia&#x27;s premier award for portrait artists on three occasions. The Dobell Prize is named in his honour.

== Career ==
Dobell was born in Cooks Hill, a working-class neighbourhood of Newcastle, New South Wales in Australia to Robert Way Dobell and Margaret Emma (née Wrightson). His father was a builder and there were six children.

Dobell&#x27;s artistic talents were evident early. In 1916, he was apprenticed to Newcastle architect, Wallace L. Porter and in 1924 he moved to Sydney as a draftsman. In 1925, he enrolled in evening art classes at the Sydney Art School (which later became the Julian Ashton Art School), with Henry Gibbons as his teacher. He was influenced by George Washington Lambert. He was also gay and consequently never married, while several of his works carried strong homoerotic overtones.

In 1929, Dobell was awarded the Society of Artists&#x27; Travelling Scholarship and travelled to England to the Slade School of Fine Art where he studied under Philip Wilson Steer and Henry Tonks. In 1930, he won first prize for figure painting at Slade and also travelled to Poland. In 1931 he moved on to Belgium and Paris, and after 10 years in Europe returned to Australia – taking with him a new Expressionist style of painting as opposed to his earlier naturalistic approach.

In 1939, he began as a part-time teacher at East Sydney Technical College. After the outbreak of war, he was drafted into the Civil Construction Corps of the Allied Works Council in 1941 as a camouflage painter; he later became an unofficial war artist. During his two years as a camouflage painter, he shared a tent with artist Joshua Smith.

In 1944, he had his first solo exhibition including public collection loans at the inauguration of the David Jones Art Gallery, Sydney.

In 1949, he visited New Guinea as a guest of Sir Edward Hallstrom with writers Frank Clune and Colin Simpson. The trip inspired a new series of tiny, brilliantly coloured landscapes. In 1950, he revisited New Guinea; on his return to Australia he continued to paint scenes of New Guinea, as well as portraits.

Between 1960 and 1963 &quot;TIME&quot; magazine commissioned Dobell to paint four portraits for covers, one per year, of: Sir Robert Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia; South Vietnam&#x27;s President Ngô Đình Diệm; Frederick G. Donner, the Chairman of General Motors; and Tunku Abdul Rahman, Prime Minister of Malaysia.

In 1964, Dobell exhibited in a major retrospective at the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the first monograph of his work was written by James Gleeson.

===The Archibald Prize controversy===
In 1943, Dobell&#x27;s portrait of Joshua Smith, titled &quot;Portrait of an artist&quot;, was awarded the Archibald Prize. This was contested in 1944 by two unsuccessful entrants (Mary Edwell-Burke and Joseph Wolinski), who brought a lawsuit against Dobell and the Gallery&#x27;s Board of Trustees in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on the grounds that the painting was a caricature and therefore not eligible for the prize. Public opinion was sharply divided, with most viewers puzzled by the unexpected portrait.

One art critic was highly laudatory:
:Creating a man in the simplicity of everyday existence, Dobell reaches profundity by his understanding of this life which, at this instant, is realised and merged with his own nature.
During his courtroom defense of the piece Dobell stated:&quot;Art fails to be Art if you fail to select for your design. All artists must do that and I did it.&quot;The claim was dismissed and the award was upheld, but the ordeal left Dobell emotionally disturbed and he retreated in 1945 to his sister&#x27;s home at Wangi Wangi on Lake Macquarie, where he began to paint landscapes. The Supreme Court opinion by Mister Justice Roper said:
: The picture in question is characterized by some startling exaggeration and distortion, clearly intended by the artist, his technique being too brilliant to admit of any other conclusion. It bears, nevertheless, a strong degree of likeness to the subject and is, I think, undoubtedly a pictorial representation of him. I find it a fact that it is a portrait within the meaning of the words in the will, and consequently the trustees did not err in admitting it to the competition.

== Death and legacy ==

Dobell was a very private man, known almost always as &quot;Bill&quot;. He died on 13 May 1970 at his home in the Lake Macquarie suburb of of hypertensive heart disease. He was cremated with Anglican rites and his ashes interred at Newcastle Memorial Park in Beresfield, New South Wales where his plaque incorrectly states his knighthood is a KBE whereas he was awarded a OBE in 1965 and his knighthood derives from being invested as a Knight Bachelor in 1966.

The sole beneficiary of his estate was the Sir William Dobell Art Foundation, which was founded on 19 January 1971 and awards the Dobell Australian Drawing Biennial, which is named in his honour. 

A film of Dobell&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Yours sincerely, Bill Dobell&quot; was made in 1981 by Brian Adams and Cathy Shirley for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the William Dobell Art Foundation. Brian Adams&#x27; book &quot;Portrait of an Artist – A biography of William Dobell&quot; was first published in 1983 by Hutchinson Publishing Group and revised in paperback in 1992 for Random House Australia.

A book on the life and art of William Dobell, &quot;William Dobell: An Artist&#x27;s Life&quot; by Elizabeth Donaldson, was compiled in 2010 with the support of the Sir William Dobell Art Foundation and Dobell House, in Wangi Wangi. It is published by Exisle Publishing.

A biography, &quot;Bill: The Life of William Dobell&quot;, was published in 2014 by Scott Bevan.

In November 2023 it was announced that Dobell was one of 14 people, places and events commemorated in the second round of blue plaques sponsored by the Government of New South Wales alongside Kathleen Butler, godmother of Sydney Harbour Bridge; Emma Jane Callaghan, an Aboriginal midwife and activist; Susan Katherina Schardt; journalist Dorothy Drain; writer Charmian Clift; Beryl Mary McLaughlin, one of the first three women to graduate in architecture from the University of Sydney; Grace Emily Munro, Syms Covington; Ioannis (Jack) and Antonios (Tony) Notaras; Ken Thomas of Thomas Nationwide Transport, Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club and the first release of myxomatosis.

<doc id="1241234" wikidata="Q32825" url="?curid=1241234" title="Blue (English group)">
<text>Blue are an English boy band consisting of members Simon Webbe, Duncan James, Antony Costa, and Lee Ryan. The group formed in 2000 and released three studio albums before announcing a hiatus in late 2004. 
In January 2011, the group reformed and represented their country at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest in Düsseldorf with the song &quot;I Can&quot;, coming in 11th place with 100 points. In 2013, it was confirmed that the group would be joining &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, in which six groups from the past (including Liberty X, Atomic Kitten and 5ive) reform for a one-off gig. On 27 March 2013, the group announced they would embark on their first headlining tour later on in the year, their first tour in nearly ten years.

In April 2015, Blue were dropped by their record label Sony due to the poor performance of their fifth album &quot;Colours&quot;. In 2022, Blue returned with singles &quot;Haven&#x27;t Found You Yet&quot; and &quot;Dance with Me&quot;, both from their sixth studio album &quot;Heart &amp; Soul&quot;, which was released on 28 October 2022.

Blue have sold 15 million records worldwide. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Blue has been certified for 3.6 million albums and 2.4 million singles in the UK.

==History==
===1999–2001: Formation and &quot;All Rise&quot;===
In May 1999, Lee Ryan and Antony Costa met at the ages of 15 and 17, respectively, when auditioning for a boy band on ITV&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot;, with Simon Cowell putting the group together. Ryan made it into the band, as did Will Young (who would go on to win the first series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in 2002), although Costa was not chosen. The boy band never took off, but Ryan and Costa remained friends following their meeting.

In 2000, Costa and another one of his friends, Duncan James, decided to form their own band, and they were soon joined by Ryan. Their manager Daniel Glatman said, &quot;Duncan came to see me with his friend, Antony Costa, who was also in the same position [wanted to be in the music industry], and they told me that they wanted to do something together. When I asked them if they had anyone in mind to work with, they said they had a friend, Lee Ryan, whom they wanted to invite to join their band. The three of them came in a couple of days later and I was completely blown away by the incredibly talented stars that stood before me.&quot; Ryan, Costa, James and Glatman all felt that something was missing and so they went on to audition for a fourth member, a position eventually filled by Ryan&#x27;s flatmate, Simon Webbe.

Blue started recording for their debut album following their new line-up. They released their debut single &quot;All Rise&quot; in May 2001 and it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. Their follow-up single &quot;Too Close&quot; was released in August 2001 and peaked at number one. Following this, the band went to New York City to film the &quot;If You Come Back&quot; music video, and while there, they witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Center. The following month, Blue were being interviewed by British newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; and Ryan commented that &quot;This New York thing is being blown out of proportion&quot; and asked &quot;What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that&#x27;s more important.&quot; The other members of the band tried to silence Ryan, but he went on. This caused a huge media backlash that resulted in Blue losing a record deal in the United States and campaigns to sack Ryan from the group. Despite the backlash, Blue went on to achieve a second number one in November with the ballad. The album &quot;All Rise&quot; was released in time for Christmas and reached number one, eventually selling in excess of 1.3 million copies in the UK. It peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 4× Platinum in the UK. The album spent 63 weeks on the UK top 75 Albums chart. The final single from the album, &quot;Fly By II&quot;, reached number six in March 2002.

The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Sharon Mawer of AllMusic gave the album three and half stars out of five and noted, &quot;The vocals were sung as if there was some real feeling, and that maybe is what separated Blue from their peers.&quot; Andre Paine of the &quot;NME&quot; gave the album five stars out of ten stating, when describing some of the tracks that &quot;All of these are fine, but so as not to alienate a single teenage girl, there&#x27;s also the traditional boyband slop; &#x27;If You Come Back&#x27; ...the ballads and various Backstreet Boys rip-offs. But at least Stargate &amp; Ray Ruffin know what they do. And Blue are young and talented enough to secure themselves a successful pop career.&quot;

===2002–2004: &quot;One Love&quot; and &quot;Guilty&quot;===
Blue&#x27;s second album, &quot;One Love&quot;, was released in October 2002, entering at number one on the UK Albums Chart and selling more than 150,000 copies. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;One Love&quot;, which peaked at number three, &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, featuring vocals from Elton John, which peaked at number one, and &quot;U Make Me Wanna&quot;, which peaked at number four. The song &quot;Supersexual&quot; was issued in parts of South America and Spain in order to promote the band in the region. The album peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart, where it stayed for one week. On 20 December 2003 it was certified 4× Platinum in the UK. In June 2003, Hugh and David Nicholson of 1970s Scottish band Blue took the group to court, attempting to sue them and their record label EMI for £5 million. The case was a high-profile High Court case over the rights to use the name Blue. After some negotiation, the two groups agreed to drop the case and were both allowed to continue to be known as Blue and to use the name commercially.

Their third album, &quot;Guilty&quot;, was released in autumn 2003, entering at number one on the UK Albums Chart and selling 100,000 copies on the week of release. The album spawned four singles, including the title track, &quot;Guilty&quot;, which peaked at number two, &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, featuring vocals from Stevie Wonder and Angie Stone, which peaked at number 11, &quot;Breathe Easy&quot;, which peaked at number four, and &quot;Bubblin&#x27;&quot;, which peaked at number nine.

===2004–05: &quot;Best of Blue&quot; and hiatus===

In November 2004, the band released &quot;Best of Blue&quot;, a greatest hits compilation. The album spawned the singles &quot;Curtain Falls&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in the UK, &quot;Get Down on It&quot; and &quot;Only Words I Know&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in France and Italy. The album peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and was awarded a double platinum certification. Following the release of &quot;Best of Blue&quot;, group members Simon Webbe and Antony Costa made the decision to release an album compiling a selection of the group&#x27;s B-sides, remixes and previously unreleased material. The album also includes three tracks only previously released in Japan: &quot;The Gift&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; and &quot;Elements&quot;. The album also includes band member Duncan James&#x27; duet single, &quot;I Believe My Heart&quot;. By the indication of the album booklet, a live version of &quot;Lonely This Christmas&quot; from &quot;CD:UK&quot; was intended to be track seven on the album, however, it was removed from the track listing for unknown reasons. The album was released in July 2005, becoming available in several European countries, as well as Japan, Thailand and China, but was not released in the UK. In 2005, the group announced that they would go into hiatus to devote themselves to solo careers for some time. In 2009, the band planned a return, but it never happened at the time.

===2011–2012: Return and Eurovision Song Contest===
 It was announced on 29 January 2011 that Blue would reunite and also represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011, with their entry &quot;I Can&quot;. It coincided with the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the band in 2001 and a one-hour documentary, &quot;&quot;, was broadcast in April 2011 celebrated their preparations for the final. It was the third time the group has Eurovision ambitions as group member Lee Ryan wrote and composed &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, Andy Scott-Lee&#x27;s song for the 2005 edition of &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot;. Furthermore, Antony Costa came second in the 2006 edition of the show with the song &quot;It&#x27;s A Beautiful Thing&quot;. Group member Duncan James was a panellist on all episodes of the &quot;&quot; series in 2009, which Jade Ewen won. He also announced the UK votes in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 final.

Blue became the first UK representatives since The Shadows in 1975 to have had multiple no.1 singles in the UK chart prior to appearing in Eurovision, and the first since Sonia in 1993 to have had a no.1 at all before entering the competition. The song &quot;I Can&quot; premiered on 11 March 2011, on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;. In the contest, they came 11th with 100 points. After the contest Blue said they were the victims of political voting, claiming they would have finished higher if countries had voted for the performance rather than their neighbours. It was later revealed that, when the European Broadcasting Union (who runs Eurovision) released the split Televote &amp; Jury results, Blue were in 5th place in the televote, with the final result down to finishing in 22nd place on the jury vote. Duncan James insisted that the result of their Eurovision bid won&#x27;t affect their UK comeback, adding: &quot;Should the worst happen, we&#x27;re still going to press ahead with the album. It won&#x27;t be the last of us – we&#x27;re all fully committed to this band again.&quot;

The band revealed during an interview that they had recorded a collaboration with American R&amp;B superstar Bruno Mars for their upcoming fourth studio album. Discussing the record with Digital Spy, Lee Ryan said: &quot;We&#x27;ve been writing with Ne-Yo, and I&#x27;ve written at least a couple of songs on my own that will probably make the album. We&#x27;ve also been working with Bruno Mars on a song called &quot;Black and Blue&quot; – he&#x27;s sending his parts over from a demo we recorded a while ago. It&#x27;s got some haunting notes on the chorus.&quot; They also revealed that three tracks on the album had been produced by RedOne and that they felt that the material was &quot;their best work to date&quot;. During February 2012, the band embarked on a small tour across Manila, performing with fellow boyband A1 and Jeff Timmons in three special concerts, two of which included the Smart Araneta Coliseum on 25 February 2012, and the Singapore Indoor Stadium on 28 February. The tour was billed as &quot;Boybands: The Greatest Hits Tour&quot;.

<doc id="1241238" wikidata="Q2165493" url="?curid=1241238" title="Pipeline (software)">
<text>In software engineering, a pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements (processes, threads, coroutines, functions, &quot;etc.&quot;), arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next. The concept is analogous to a physical pipeline. Usually some amount of buffering is provided between consecutive elements. The information that flows in these pipelines is often a stream of records, bytes, or bits, and the elements of a pipeline may be called filters. This is also called the pipe(s) and filters design pattern which is monolithic. Its advantages are simplicity and low cost while its disadvantages are lack of elasticity, fault tolerance and scalability. Connecting elements into a pipeline is analogous to function composition.

Narrowly speaking, a pipeline is linear and one-directional, though sometimes the term is applied to more general flows. For example, a primarily one-directional pipeline may have some communication in the other direction, known as a &quot;return channel&quot; or &quot;backchannel,&quot; as in the lexer hack, or a pipeline may be fully bi-directional. Flows with one-directional trees and directed acyclic graph topologies behave similarly to linear pipelines. The lack of cycles in such flows makes them simple, and thus they may be loosely referred to as &quot;pipelines&quot;.

==Implementation==
Pipelines are often implemented in a multitasking OS, by launching all elements at the same time as processes, and automatically servicing the data read requests by each process with the data written by the upstream process. This can be called a &quot;multiprocessed pipeline.&quot; In this way, the scheduler will naturally switch the CPU among the processes so as to minimize its idle time. In other common models, elements are implemented as lightweight threads or as coroutines to reduce the OS overhead often involved with processes. Depending on the OS, threads may be scheduled directly by the OS or by a thread manager. Coroutines are always scheduled by a coroutine manager of some form.

Read and write requests are usually blocking operations. This means that the execution of the source process, upon writing, is suspended until all data can be written to the destination process. Likewise, the execution of the destination process, upon reading, is suspended until at least some of the requested data can be obtained from the source process. This cannot lead to a deadlock, where both processes would wait indefinitely for each other to respond, since at least one of the processes will soon have its request serviced by the operating system, and continue to run.

For performance, most operating systems implementing pipes use pipe buffers, which allow the source process to provide more data than the destination process is currently able or willing to receive. Under most Unixes and Unix-like operating systems, a special command is also available, typically called &quot;buffer&quot;, that implements a pipe buffer of potentially much larger and configurable size. This command can be useful if the destination process is significantly slower than the source process, but it is desired that the source process complete its task as soon as possible. E.g., if the source process consists of a command which reads an audio track from a CD and the destination process consists of a command which compresses the waveform audio data to a format like MP3. In this case, buffering the entire track in a pipe buffer would allow the CD drive to spin down more quickly, and enable the user to remove the CD from the drive before the encoding process has finished.

Such a buffer command can be implemented using system calls for reading and writing data. Wasteful busy waiting can be avoided by using facilities such as poll or select or multithreading.

Some notable examples of pipeline software systems include:
* RaftLib – C/C++ Apache 2.0 License

==VM/CMS and z/OS==
CMS Pipelines is a port of the pipeline idea to VM/CMS and z/OS systems. It supports much more complex pipeline structures than Unix shells, with steps taking multiple input streams and producing multiple output streams. (Such functionality is supported by the Unix kernel, but few programs use it as it makes for complicated syntax and blocking modes, although some shells do support it via arbitrary file descriptor assignment).

Traditional application programs on IBM mainframe operating systems have no standard input and output streams to allow redirection or piping. Instead of spawning processes with external programs, CMS Pipelines features a lightweight dispatcher to concurrently execute instances of more than 200 built-in programs that implement typical UNIX utilities and interface to devices and operating system services. In addition to the built-in programs, CMS Pipelines defines a framework to allow user-written REXX programs with input and output streams that can be used in the pipeline.

Data on IBM mainframes typically resides in a record-oriented filesystem and connected I/O devices operate in record mode rather than stream mode. As a consequence, data in CMS Pipelines is handled in record mode. For text files, a record holds one line of text. In general, CMS Pipelines does not buffer the data but passes records of data in a lock-step fashion from one program to the next. This ensures a deterministic flow of data through a network of interconnected pipelines.

==Object pipelines==
Beside byte stream-based pipelines, there are also object pipelines. In an object pipeline, processing elements output objects instead of text. PowerShell includes an internal object pipeline that transfers .NET objects between functions within the PowerShell runtime. Channels, found in the Limbo programming language, are other examples of this metaphor.

==Pipelines in GUIs==
Graphical environments such as RISC OS and ROX Desktop also use pipelines. Rather than providing a save dialog box containing a file manager to let the user specify where a program should write data, RISC OS and ROX provide a save dialog box containing an icon (and a field to specify the name). The destination is specified by dragging and dropping the icon. The user can drop the icon anywhere an already-saved file could be dropped, including onto icons of other programs. If the icon is dropped onto a program&#x27;s icon, it is loaded and the contents that would otherwise have been saved are passed in on the new program&#x27;s standard input stream.

For instance, a user browsing the world-wide web might come across a .gz compressed image which they want to edit and re-upload. Using GUI pipelines, they could drag the link to their de-archiving program, drag the icon representing the extracted contents to their image editor, edit it, open the save as dialog, and drag its icon to their uploading software.

Conceptually, this method could be used with a conventional save dialog box, but this would require the user&#x27;s programs to have an obvious and easily accessible location in the filesystem. As this is often not the case, GUI pipelines are rare.

==Other considerations==
The name &quot;pipeline&quot; comes from a rough analogy with physical plumbing in that a pipeline usually allows information to flow in only one direction, like water often flows in a pipe.

Pipes and filters can be viewed as a form of functional programming, using byte streams as data objects. More specifically, they can be seen as a particular form of monad for I/O.

The concept of pipeline is also central to the Cocoon web development framework or to any XProc (the W3C Standards) implementations, where it allows a source stream to be modified before eventual display.

This pattern encourages the use of text streams as the input and output of programs. This reliance on text has to be accounted when creating graphic shells to text programs.

<doc id="1241242" wikidata="Q210718" url="?curid=1241242" title="Asia (Roman province)">
<text>Asia () was a Roman province covering most of western Asia Minor (Anatolia), which was created following the Roman Republic&#x27;s annexation of the Attalid Kingdom in 133 BC. After the establishment of the Roman Empire by Augustus, it was the most prestigious senatorial province and was governed by a proconsul. That arrangement endured until the province was subdivided in the fourth century AD.

The province was one of the richest of the Empire and was at peace for most of the Imperial period. It contained hundreds of largely self-governing Greek city-states, who competed fiercely with one another for status, through appeals to the Imperial authorities and the cultivation of prestigious cultural institutions such as festival games, religious cults, and oratory.

==Geography==
The province of Asia originally consisted of the territories of Mysia, the Troad, Aeolis, Lydia, Ionia, Caria, and the land corridor through Pisidia to Pamphylia. The Aegean islands, with the exception of Crete, were part of the province of Asia. The western part of Phrygia was added to Asia in 116 BC. Lycaonia was added before 100 BC, while the area around Cibyra was added in 82 BC. The southeast region of Asia province was later reassigned to the province of Cilicia. During the Empire, the province of Asia was bounded by Bithynia to the north, Lycia to the south, and Galatia to the east.

==History==
===Background===
The word &quot;Asia&quot; comes from the Greek word , originally only applied to the eastern shore of the Aegean Sea, which is attested in Mycenaean Greek texts as &quot;aswia&quot; and probably derives from Assuwa, the name of the region in the Bronze Age. After the Greco-Persian Wars of the early 5th century BC, Greek sources often use it to refer to the whole continent, 

The territory was ruled by various Macedonian kingdoms following the conquests of Alexander the Great. In 190 BC, the Romans crushed Antiochus III the Great at the battle of Magnesia. In the subsequent Treaty of Apamea (188 BC), he surrendered the entire territory to the Romans, who placed most of it under the control of the Attalid dynasty based at Pergamum. The western part of Phrygia was given to Mithridates V, King of Pontus, while Caria and Lycia were given to Rhodes.

===Annexation===
With no legitimate heir, King Attalus III of Pergamum, having been a close ally of Rome, chose to bequeath his kingdom to Rome. Upon his death in 133 BC, the pretender Eumenes III staged a rebellion. He defeated one of the consuls of 131 BC, Crassus Mucianus. The following year, the consul Marcus Perperna brought the war to a close by defeating Eumenes in the first engagement. He followed up his victory by laying siege to Stratonikeia, whither Eumenes had fled. The town was compelled by famine to surrender and the pretender fell into the consul&#x27;s hands. Manius Aquillius formally established the region as the province of Asia. The bequest of the Attalid kingdom to Rome presented serious implications for neighbouring territories. It was during this period that the Kingdom of Pontus rose in status under the rule of Mithridates VI. He would prove to be a formidable foe to Rome&#x27;s success in Asia and beyond.
===Mithridates and Sulla===

By 88 BC, Mithridates VI of Pontus had conquered virtually all of Asia. Capitalizing on the hatred of corrupt Roman practices, Mithridates instigated a mass revolt against Rome, ordering the slaughter of all Romans and Italians in the province. Contemporary estimates of casualties ranged from 80,000 up to 150,000.

Three years later, Lucius Cornelius Sulla defeated Mithridates in the First Mithridatic War and in 85 BC reorganized the province into eleven assize districts, each central to a number of smaller, subordinate cities. These assize centers, which developed into the Roman dioceses, included Ephesus, Pergamum - the old Attalid capital, Smyrna, Adramyttium, Cyzicus, Synnada, Apamea, Miletus, and Halicarnassus. The first three cities - Ephesus, Pergamum, and Smyrna - competed to be the dominant city-state in Asia province. Age-old inter-city rivalry continued to inhibit any sort of progress towards provincial unity.

===Augustus===
After Augustus came to power, he established a proconsulship for the province of Asia, embracing the regions of Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia. To its east, the province of Galatia was established. The proconsul spent much of his year-long term traveling throughout the province hearing cases and conducting other judicial business at each of the assize centers. Rome&#x27;s transition from the Republic to the early Empire saw an important change in the role of existing provincial cities, which evolved from autonomous city-states to Imperial administrative centers.

The beginning of the principate of Augustus also signaled the rise of new cities in Mysia, Lydia and Phrygia. The province grew to be an elaborate system of self-governing cities, each responsible for its own economics, taxes, and law in its territory. The reign of Augustus further signaled the start of urbanization of Asia province, as public building became the defining characteristic of a city.

===Decline===
The 3rd century AD marked a serious decline in Asia stemming in part from epidemic disease, beginning with the Antonine plague, the indiscipline of local soldiers and also the diminishing instances of voluntary civic generosity. The Gothic invasions of the 250s and 260s, part of the Crisis of the Third Century, contributed to failing feelings of security. Furthermore, as political and strategic emphasis shifted away from Asia proconsularis, it lost much of its former prominence.

In the 4th century, Diocletian divided Asia province into seven smaller provinces. During the 5th century and, until the mid-6th century the cities and provinces of western Anatolia experienced an economic renaissance. But after the great plague of 543 many cities towards the interior of the province declined to the point where they were indistinguishable from common villages by the time of the Persian and Arab invasions of the 7th century. On the other hand, leading cities from the early empire including Ephesus, Sardis, and Aphrodisias retained much of their former glory and came to serve as the new provincial capitals. Asia remained a center of the dominant Hellenistic culture in the east for centuries. The territory remained part of the (Eastern) Roman Empire until the end of the 14th century when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.
==Government==
===Taxation===
Rome had always been very reluctant to involve itself in matters to the east. It typically relied on allies to arbitrate in the case of a conflict. Very rarely would Rome send delegations to the east, much less have a strong governmental presence. This apathy did not change much even after the gift from Attalus in 133 BC. In fact, parts of the Pergamene kingdom were voluntarily relinquished to different nations. For example, Great Phrygia was given to Mithridates V of Pontus.

While the Senate was hesitant in involving itself in Asian affairs, others had no such reluctance. A law passed by Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC gave the right to collect taxes in Asia to members of the equestrian order. The privilege of collecting taxes was almost certainly exploited by individuals from the Republic.

In case a community was unable to pay taxes, they borrowed from Roman lenders but at exorbitant rates. This more often than not resulted in default on said loans and consequently led Roman lenders to seize the borrower&#x27;s land, their last remaining asset of value. In this way and by outright purchase, Romans dispersed throughout the province of Asia.

===Military presence===
Other than to quell occasional revolts, there was minimal military presence in Asia province, until forces led by Sulla set forth in their campaign against Mithridates VI. In fact, Asia province was unique in that it was one of the few ungarrisoned provinces of the empire. While no full legions were ever stationed inside the province, that is not to say that there was no military presence whatsoever.

Legionary detachments were present in the Phrygian cities of Apamea and Amorium. Auxiliary cohorts were stationed in Phrygian Eumeneia while smaller groups of soldiers regularly patrolled the mountainous regions. High military presence in rural regions around 3rd century AD caused great civil unrest in the province.

==Imperial cult==
Imperial cult was prevalent in provincial communities during the Roman empire. Soon after Augustus came to power, temples erected in his honor sprang up across Asia province. The establishment of provincial centers of imperial cult further spawned local cults. These sites served as models followed by other provinces throughout the empire.

Imperial cult served as a way for subjects of Asia province to come to terms with imperial rule within the framework of their communities. Religious practices were very much a public affair and involved citizens in all its aspects including prayer, sacrifice, and processions. Rituals held in honor of a particular emperor frequently outnumbered those of other gods. No other cult matched the imperial cult in terms of dispersion and commonality.

<doc id="1241249" wikidata="Q1752911" url="?curid=1241249" title="Dogmatix">
<text>Dogmatix () is a fictional white terrier dog who is a companion to Obelix in the &quot;Asterix&quot; comics. Dogmatix is a pun on the words dog and dogmatic. In the original French, his name is &quot;Idéfix&quot;, itself a pun on the French expression &quot;idée fixe&quot; (fixed idea) meaning an obsession.

On January 6, 2021, it was announced that the character would have his own animated television series titled &quot;Dogmatix and the Indomitables&quot;.

==Character synopsis==
Dogmatix is the only animal among the main characters of the series. His role is minor and funny in most of the stories, serving mainly as a &#x27;bone&#x27; of contention between Asterix and Obelix as to whether he should be allowed to accompany them on their adventures. However, he is often seen doing something interesting in the background and occasionally fulfills an important part of the plot. In the words of the authors, Dogmatix is the only known &quot;canine ecologist&quot;: he loves trees and howls in distress whenever one is damaged. Despite his small size, he is quite fearless. He has drunk the magic potion on a number of occasions, but his favourite treat is to &#x27;chew a bone&#x27;.

A dog similar to Dogmatix appeared in page 28 of Asterix &amp; the Golden Sickle. Dogmatix first appears in &quot;Asterix and the Banquet&quot;. Sitting outside a butcher&#x27;s shop in Lutetia, he observes Asterix and Obelix go in. He then follows them all around Gaul, appearing in nearly every panel of the remainder of the story. The two men do not notice him until the very end, when he finally attracts Obelix&#x27;s attention at the closing banquet and is given a pat on the head and a bone. He was meant to be a one-off character (hence his leaving the village in the final picture) but he was so effective it was decided to bring him back. &quot;Pilote&quot;, the magazine that published Asterix, held a contest to find a name for the dog. Hundreds of suggestions were received. The winning name, Idéfix, was submitted by Hervé Ambroise, Dominique and Anne Boucard, and Rémi Dujat.

In the next adventure, &quot;Asterix and Cleopatra&quot;, Dogmatix is given his name and plays a more active role. Asterix and Obelix argue about whether or not Dogmatix should accompany them to Egypt, but he proves his worth by following the Gauls into a pyramid in which they were lost and guiding them out safely.

Like many dogs, Dogmatix is protective of his master, especially when he falls for, or is shown affection by, beautiful young women. In &quot;Asterix the Legionary&quot; he makes clear his loathing for Panacea with whom Obelix had fallen in love. He shows the same attitude to Influenza in &quot;Asterix and Caesar&#x27;s Gift&quot; and Melodrama in &quot;Asterix and the Great Divide&quot;. However, despite his loyalty to his master, Dogmatix has been shown to side with Asterix in arguments on various occasions, such as in &quot;Asterix and the Soothsayer&quot; and &quot;Obelix and Co.&quot;

His friendship with Pepe in &quot;Asterix in Spain &quot; and &quot;Asterix in Corsica&quot; causes Obelix to become jealous. Likewise, Dogmatix is unimpressed by Obelix&#x27;s attraction towards Panacea in the earlier stages of &quot;Asterix the Legionary&quot; and is hostile and growls when his master asks her to look after him while he is away. However, Panacea kisses him straightaway, putting him into a lovestruck daze.

Like the other villagers, he does not like Cacofonix and his only dialogue (in a thought bubble) is in Asterix and the Magic Carpet where he comments on Cacofonix&#x27;s music skills, when Cacophonix was commenting on Wazizneim.

In &quot;Asterix and the Actress&quot;, he finds a mate and returns with a litter of puppies.

==Dogmatix books==

Dogmatix&#x27;s great popularity gave rise to a line of children&#x27;s books in 1973 featuring his &quot;adventures&quot;. These were in the form of text with illustrations and were not consistent with the &quot;Asterix&quot; stories.

# (Dogmatix the Athlete)
# (Dogmatix and the Little Girl)
# (Dogmatix at the Circus)
# (The Crazy Chase)
# (Dogmatix Makes a Friend)
# (Dogmatix and the Boar Hunt)
# (Dogmatix and the Storm)
# (The Well-Deserved Tea Party)

# (Dogmatix the Wizard) - not translated to English
# (Dogmatix and the Parrot)
# (Dogmatix goes to war) - not translated to English 
# (Dogmatix and the Little Rabbit) - not translated to English

Although they carry the Goscinny/Uderzo byline, these are licensed works aimed at the children&#x27;s market. They lack the style and sophistication of the main &quot;Asterix&quot; creative team, and have little or no editing for continuity. Although widely translated (not by the regular English translators of the &quot;Asterix&quot; comics), these comics did not become very popular and are mostly forgotten. The English editions of these works also contain many glaring mistakes. For example, the chief&#x27;s wife is referred to as &quot;Bacteria&quot;, while her usual name is Impedimenta; Bacteria is the name of Unhygenix’s wife.

In 1983, an attempt was made to revive the series with two new stories. These were translated by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell, the regular English language translators of the &quot;Asterix&quot; albums.

<text>Shatsk (, ; ; ) is a rural settlement in Volyn Oblast, Kovel Raion, north-western Ukraine. It is located to the north-west of Kovel. Population: 

The village is situated in a picturesque area in the western part of Volyn Woodlands, surrounded by lakes, which are sometimes called Shatsky (Velyke Chorne, Svitiaz, Pulemetske, Luka, Liutsymer, Somynets, Karasynets, Ozertse).

In 2017, a postage stamp featuring the coat of arms of Shatsk was released by Ukrposhta.

==History==
In Rus&#x27; sources, the town located in this area is mentioned twice, in 1255 and in 1287. In Polish sources the town is first mentioned in 1410.

Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was the battlefield of the Battle of Szack between Polish forces of general Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann and the Soviet 4th Army. Afterwards it was under Soviet occupation until 1941, and then German occupation until 1944. The Jewish population of the village at the beginning of the German occupation was probably around 300. Germans arrived in the village on June 30, 1941. In October 1941, the Jews of the town and surrounding villages were held captives in a ghetto. Shortly after, 319 Jews were shot by the Einsatzkommando and German police.
Until 2020 was an administrative centre of Shatsk Raion.

Until 26 January 2024, Shatsk was designated urban-type settlement. On this day, a new law entered into force which abolished this status, and Shatsk became a rural settlement.

<doc id="1241256" wikidata="Q4692313" url="?curid=1241256" title="Agha Hasan Abedi">
<text>Agha Hasan Abedi (), (14 May 1922 – 5 August 1995) was a Pakistani banker who founded Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and saw its collapse after one of the biggest banking fraud scandals in history was unearthed. Before his death, he was convicted by the United Arab Emirates court of fraud and sentenced to eight years in prison. Abedi also founded United Bank Limited. Abedi underwent a heart transplant operation in 1988, and died of a heart attack on 5 August 1995 in Karachi.

==Early life and education==

Agha Hasan Abedi was born in Lucknow, British India, to a Urdu Speaking middle class family with members who served as advisors and courtiers to the Nawab of Awadh. He received a master&#x27;s degree in English literature and a law degree from Lucknow University. Abedi migrated to Pakistan after the creation of Pakistan in 1947.

== Career ==
Abedi started his career at the age of 24 when he joined Habib Bank Limited.

In 1959, Abedi founded the United Bank Limited (UBL). He was the Founder and the first President. Under his stewardship, UBL became the second largest bank in Pakistan. Abedi introduced the concept of personalised service and banking support to trade and industry, paying particular attention to the bank&#x27;s overseas operations. One of the first to comprehend the opportunities offered by the oil boom in the Persian Gulf, Abedi pioneered close economic collaboration in the private sector between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE President, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, extended his patronage to UBL operations both in Pakistan and abroad. 

=== Bank of Credit and Commerce International ===
In 1972, Abedi started the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) initially with funding of only. For a decade, it was the fastest growing bank in the world. At its peak, it operated in more than seventy countries and had about 1.3 million depositors.

In 1988, he left because of poor health.

In July 1991, it was found by international regulators that the bank was involved in a massive fraud and money laundering for Colombian drug cartels, Abu Nidal Organization, and Central Intelligence Agency. Subsequently, its assets were seized.

Registered in Luxembourg, the BCCI began its operations from a two-room head office in London. It developed into a worldwide banking operation with branches in 72 countries and 16,000 employees. Abedi was personally responsible for inducing a large number of Pakistanis into the field of international banking and almost 80 per cent of the BCCI&#x27;s top executive positions at the head office and in branches in various countries were held by Pakistanis. &quot;It was founded by the charismatic Agha Hasan Abedi in 1972, backed by Middle Eastern investors and run mostly by the South Asians.&quot; Abedi severed his connection with BCCI in 1990 after suffering a heart attack and led a retired life in Karachi until his death due to heart failure at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi in 1995.

=== Philanthropy ===
Abedi founded charitable organisations in UK, India, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Pakistan.

The Infaq Foundation has only one office in Karachi, Pakistan. It has capital and reserves of over Rs. 2.50 billion, which in 2009 is equivalent to just over US$30 million. Major beneficiaries among the known institutions are, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation, National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Lady Dufferin Hospital and Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology in Karachi, and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Ghulam Ishaq Khan was the first Chairman of the Foundation from 1983 to 1995.

Abedi also founded BCCI FAST in 1980 with a donation of Rs. 100 million, to promote education in computer science. It is now the first multi-campus university of Pakistan, known as National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences. It has five campuses situated in Islamabad, Peshawar, Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad.

Abedi also contributed funds to establish Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology.

==Personal life==
Hasan Abedi was married to Rabia Abedi. The couple had a daughter named Maha. Although Abedi was born into a Shia Muslim family, he was a well-known Muslim mystic. During his speeches at the meetings of the BCCI Bank, he would spend hours sharing his mystical beliefs. He believed that BCCI was not only a bank, but a god-gifted entity that was directly connected to the universe.

<text>Alexandra Huntingdon Tydings is an American actress, director, writer, producer, and activist, best known for her role as Greek Goddess Aphrodite on the television series &quot;&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Alexandra Tydings was born in Washington, D.C. She has four half-sisters and one half-brother, and is the daughter of former Maryland U.S. Senator Joseph Tydings and his second wife, Terry Lynn Huntingdon Tydings and the granddaughter of former Maryland U.S. Senator Millard Tydings. She is a graduate of Sidwell Friends School and Brown University, with a degree in film and critical theory. She speaks English, French and Spanish.

Tydings counts Katharine Hepburn and Kevin Spacey among her favorite actors. She told Whoosh, a Xena fansite, that she most enjoys the research and collaborating process of acting and that auditioning is her least favorite part of theater arts. She competed in Irish dancing as a child, and performed with The Royal Ballet of London at the Kennedy Center. Dance led to performance of all kinds; in addition to acting, she was the singer and bassist of bands Annabelle Kickbox and She&#x27;s Seen You Naked. 

Whoosh points out that Tydings maintained a vegetarian diet for 14 years, and that she enjoys gardening.

== Career ==
After graduating from Brown University, Tydings moved to Hollywood to pursue an acting career. In her first major feature film, she played opposite Woody Harrelson in Oscar winner Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Sunchaser&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She has since performed in dozens of roles in film, television and theater, including six years as a series regular on &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; where she played Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of love.

In 2015, Tydings wrote and directed &quot;The Trial of Hanna Porn&quot;, a multi-media piece on abortion, which won the Best of Fringe award at the Charm City Fringe Festival. She then went on to write, direct and produce &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot;, an independent film about two women advocating for abortion in the United States.

<text>Craig Revel Horwood (born 4 January 1965) is an Australian-British author, dancer, choreographer, conductor, theatre director, and former drag queen in the United Kingdom. He is also a patron of the Royal Osteoporosis Society.

Horwood is a judge on the BBC dancing series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and has appeared in all but one edition since its inception. He is often seen performing ballroom and Latin dance routines.

==Early life and family==
Craig Revel Horwood was born on 4 January 1965 in Ballarat in Victoria, Australia. His father Phil was a former Royal Australian Navy Lieutenant whose alcoholism had &quot;torn their family apart&quot;. He started his career as a dancer in Melbourne, then moved to London to take advantage of the greater opportunities available there and to dance competitively. In 1989, he moved to the UK from Australia, and on 20 August 2011, he became a British citizen.

Revel is Horwood&#x27;s middle name; it is not double-barrelled. In his autobiography, Horwood reveals that at the age of 17, he made money by appearing as a drag queen in bars and clubs and that his relationship with an unnamed celebrity was akin to prostitution.

==Career==
===Theatre===

====West End and UK====
Horwood&#x27;s West End credits include &quot;Spend Spend Spend&quot; and &quot;My One and Only&quot;, both of which gained Laurence Olivier Award nominations for Best Choreography.

===Television===
====&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;====
Horwood has been a member of the judging panel on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; since its inception in 2004. He has a reputation for being the harshest of the judges and is often the recipient of jeering and booing from the studio audience; he also received criticism for his apparent bias towards Emma Bunton in the fourth series of the competition. Horwood is known for stringently applying rules, as for example when marking down for an &#x27;illegal lift&#x27; in some dances if the lady&#x27;s foot leaves the floor.

Horwood has given a score of &quot;1&quot; more times than any other judge, including as part of the lowest-ever total score of 8 for Quentin Willson, dancing a Cha-cha-cha, in 2004. The routine was also the only ever single-digit score and the only time more than one member of the panel has given a score of &quot;1&quot;.

Horwood has become known and imitated for his locutions, which often include exaggeratedly lengthened vowels, including: &#x27;It was a complete dahnce di-sah-ster, dahling&#x27; and &quot;Chah-Chah-Chah&quot;. These are available as ringtones through Horwood&#x27;s website, with profits going to the National Osteoporosis Society. Another common utterance is &#x27;Three words: Fab-u-lous!&#x27;, with the syllables of the word articulated as three separate words. Horwood similarly breaks up the syllables and throws the stress forward to the final syllable for &#x27;A-ma-zing!&#x27; To appreciate erotically charged routines, Horwood will declaim &#x27;absolute filth&#x27;, often immediately followed by &#x27;...and I &quot;loved&quot; it!&#x27; Passing judgment on Kimberley Walsh in 2012, Horwood said the dance was &#x27;indecent, improper, absolute filth&#x27;, and added: &#x27;I loved it.&#x27;

====&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;====
Horwood was a judge on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in New Zealand, along with Brendan Cole. He was also a judge on the Australian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for seasons 16 and 17, since its 2019 &#x27;revival&#x27;, along with Sharna Burgess and Tristan MacManus.

====&quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot;====
Horwood became a judge on &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; in 2005, along with Lesley Garrett and Richard Park. He and Garrett replaced vocal coaches David Grant and Carrie Grant on the panel; however, the pair still appeared as voice coaches on the series. He returned as a judge for the third series of the Comic Relief edition in 2007.

===Other television appearances===
 Horwood appeared in Episode 5 of Series 2 of &quot;Louis Theroux&#x27;s Weird Weekends&quot;, during which Theroux investigated the trials and tribulations of struggling New York City actors. In May and June 2007, Horwood appeared as a contestant on &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;, reaching the final alongside Nadia Sawalha and Midge Ure.

Horwood also appeared on CBBC&#x27;s television programme &quot;12 Again&quot;, talking about his life when he was 12 years old; on 22 February 2013, he appeared on Room 101.

Horwood won the reworked version of the 2008 BBC series Maestro, called &quot;Maestro at the Opera&quot;; he competed against Josie Lawrence, Marcus du Sautoy and Trevor Nelson. Also appearing were Mark Elder, Danielle de Niese, Alfie Boe and Kiri te Kanawa. The series was partly filmed at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, where Horwood, as eventual winner, conducted Act II of &quot;La Bohème&quot; in late 2012.

Horwood lent his vocals to a single released by other celebrities under tutorage of choirmaster Gareth Malone for the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity single of 2014; the choir performed a version of Avicii&#x27;s &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;. On 15 January 2016, he appeared as a panellist on a special edition of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot; (titled &quot;Loose Women and Men&quot;) alongside series regulars Andrea McLean and Nadia Sawalha and fellow special hosts Peter Andre and Chris Kamara. He also starred in an edition of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast on 13 July 2017, in which he learned about his ancestry and family history.

Horwood also voiced the snake Cornelius in animated series &quot;Sadie Sparks&quot;, which airs on Disney Channel; and was woken up by Michael McIntyre in the Christmas Midnight Gameshow on &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s Big Christmas Show&quot; which aired on Christmas Day 2019.

In 2021, Horwood appeared on &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot;, masked as Knickerbocker Glory in the Semi-Final; he was the seventh celebrity to be unmasked. In June that same year, it was announced that Horwood would be seen joining fellow dancer, judge, presenter and choreographer Bruno Tonioli in &quot;Craig and Bruno&#x27;s Great British Roadtrip&quot;; in the series of six half-hour episodes, made by RDF Television for ITV, the pair showcased routes and sights around Britain whilst indulging shared passions for fun, food, dance and classic cars.

In October 2020, Horwood released his first novel with Michael O&#x27;Mara Books, entitled &quot; Dances and Dreams on Diamond Street&quot;; the paperback edition was published in June 2021.

==Personal life==

Horwood was married to Jane Horwood from 1990 to 1992. In December 2014, Horwood informed a reporter from &quot;OK!&quot; magazine that &quot;I was bisexual for a long time. I flitted between men and women quite a lot between the ages of 17 and 26. My wife Jane left me for another man. Then I fell in love with a bloke. I have been gay ever since.&quot; His former partner Damon Scott had been a runner up on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

Since early 2018, Horwood has been in a relationship with horticulturist Jonathan Myring. In April 2020 Horwood and Myring announced their engagement. The pair, who met on Tinder, became engaged while in Tasmania.

Horwood became a patron of the Royal Osteoporosis Society in 2009. In this, he has found common ground with Queen Camilla, the Society&#x27;s Royal patron (whose mother, like his, had bone disease). The two of them danced the cha-cha-cha together, on a school visit to mark National Osteoporosis Day in 2009.

In January 2015, Horwood revealed on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot; that he suffered from anorexia and body dysmorphia as a teenager and young dancer, as a result of trying to make himself look like other young men, and other dancers in particular.

The 14th British series of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; featured Horwood&#x27;s ancestry in the second episode; in this, his family history research took him home to Australia, where he discovered that his family tree traces to Gloucestershire, Lancashire and Essex in England. Horwood found out that he is not the first dancer in his family, and that he is descended from gold prospectors who went bankrupt before becoming rich on finding a gold nugget. He also learned further that his great-great-grandfather, Moses Horwood, who is revealed in the programme to have been a petty criminal from England, was convicted at the Gloucestershire assizes and transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) in 1841. Criminal records identified by TheGenealogist include a transportation document for Moses Horwood, showing he departed England on 1 December 1841 on board a ship called the &quot;John Brewer&quot;.

In late 2021, Horwood moved to a seven-bedroom property dating back to 1867 in the Northamptonshire village of King&#x27;s Cliffe. Horwood and Myring plan to marry, in August 2025, at St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Normanton, at Rutland Water.

==Honours==
Horwood has a waxwork in Madame Tussauds Blackpool which has been on display since July 2018.

On 20 July 2021, Horwood was made an Honorary Doctor of Arts by the University of Winchester at Winchester Cathedral.

==History==
The settlement of São Luís began in 1857 with a ranch belonging to the Neto family. This was near a stream flowing near the São Luíz hills, where there were fertile lands that lent themselves to the cultivation of sugar cane and the raising of cattle. The founder, José Neto Cerqueira Leão Sobrinho gave the name of São Luíz de Montes Belos in honor of Saint Louis and the beautiful hills nearby. In 1948 it was raised to the category of district belonging to Goiás. In 1953 it became a municipality. The spelling of the name &quot;Luís&quot; is sometimes with &quot;z&quot; instead of &quot;s&quot; and is often without the accent on the letter &quot;i&quot;. Official spelling used by Seplan is São Luis de Montes Belos. The first mayor was &quot;Nenen de Brito&quot;, Deusdedit de Brito, his birth certificate name; respectful man who continually served the people of São Luis de Montes Belos as a representative for 28 years.

The first Mayor was &quot;Nenen de Brito&quot;, Deusdedit Brito.

<text>State Route 23 (SR 23) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that connects the Pacific coast and the Santa Monica Mountains to the Conejo and Santa Clara River valleys. It runs from Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) in Malibu in Los Angeles County to Ventura Street (State Route 126) in Fillmore in Ventura County.

==Route description==


SR 23 consists of three distinct sections. The southern section begins as Decker Canyon Road near Trancas in Malibu, where SR 23 intersects with the Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1), or &quot;PCH.&quot; This portion provides numerous vistas of the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean during the daytime, but extreme caution is advised, especially as the road nears PCH. It is a notoriously dangerous road, and the rusted chassis of cars that have gone over the side can still be seen. Philip Taylor Kramer, bassist with the rock band Iron Butterfly from 1974–1977, allegedly committed suicide by driving his van over the side along this route. Along its steep and winding path through the Santa Monica Mountains as an increasingly tight and twisting canyon road until its intersection with Potrero Road, SR 23 becomes Westlake Boulevard, where it departs Los Angeles County for Ventura County and heads roughly two miles northeast through the Westlake section of Thousand Oaks, a developed residential community. SR 23 then merges with Ventura Freeway (U.S. Route 101) and runs concurrently with it north to the Moorpark Freeway.

The middle section is a major route for traffic headed between Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. It starts in Thousand Oaks, splitting off from the concurrency with US 101 and heading north, with three lanes in both directions. This section terminates at the exit for Los Angeles Avenue when the freeway turns east to become the Ronald Reagan Freeway (State Route 118). Funding for widening of the freeway was approved August 18, 2005, with construction to begin in February 2006, to be completed in 2009. The widening was completed ahead of schedule in April 2008. However, traffic along this freeway during rush hour is extremely congested, particularly near the interchange with US 101.

The northernmost section begins at State Route 118 in Moorpark (called &quot;Los Angeles Avenue&quot; in Moorpark), and heads north as Grimes Canyon Road through orange groves and sandstone cliffs. In Fillmore, it terminates at State Route 126. The road in Fillmore actually continues past Route 126 up to the foot of the Los Padres National Forest.

On SR 23 from Tierra Rejada Road to Olsen Road (and vice versa) is a bike lane. After crossing Tierra Rejada Road (going north) and Olsen Road (going south), bicyclists are prohibited from crossing.

SR 23 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and the freeway portion is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 23 is known as the Military Intelligence Service Memorial Highway from US 101 to California Route 118, in honor of the Military Intelligence Service, the 100th Infantry Battalion, and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, composed entirely of Japanese Americans.

==History==
State Route 23 has been designated as such since 1934. However, at this time it was also designated as Legislative Route 155. The freeway portion of SR 23 opened in several phases between 1971 and 1994. Before then, SR 23 ran along Moorpark Road and intersected with U.S. 101 near Newbury Park, although it still ran concurrently with U.S. 101, which was then an expressway.

SR 23 was designated as part of the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959.

===Decker Freeway===

The Decker Freeway was an unbuilt north–south freeway that would connect SR 118, US 101, and SR 1. The freeway was part of a 1958 plan by the Metropolitan Engineering Board, but was later considered to be geographically improbable and the plans were abandoned.
The freeway&#x27;s southern portion, from SR 1 to US 101, follows the general alignment of Decker Canyon Road and Westlake Boulevard, a segment of SR 23. It would continue north before terminating at SR 118 near First Street.
