<text>Adolph Abramovich Joffe (; alternatively transliterated as Adolf Ioffe or Yoffe; 10 October 1883 – 16 November 1927) was a Russian revolutionary, Bolshevik politician and Soviet diplomat of Karaite descent.

==Biography==

===Revolutionary career===

Adolf Abramovich Joffe was born in Simferopol, Crimea, Russian Empire in a wealthy Karaite family. He became a social democrat in 1900 while still in high school, formally joining the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903. In 1904 Joffe was sent to Baku, which he had to flee to avoid arrest. He was then sent to Moscow, but had to flee again, this time abroad. After the events of Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905, Joffe returned to Russia and took an active part in the Russian Revolution of 1905. In early 1906 he was forced to emigrate and lived in Berlin until his expulsion from Germany in May 1906.

In Russia, Joffe was close to the Menshevik faction within the Russian Social Democratic Party. However, after moving to Vienna in May 1906, he became close to Leon Trotsky&#x27;s position and helped Trotsky edit &quot;Pravda&quot; from 1908 to 1912 while studying medicine and psychoanalysis with Alfred Adler. He also used his family&#x27;s fortune to support &quot;Pravda&quot; financially. During the course of his underground revolutionary activity Joffe adopted the party name &quot;V. Krymsky,&quot; the surname meaning &quot;The Crimean.&quot;

In 1912 Joffe was arrested while visiting Odessa, imprisoned for 10 months and then exiled to Siberia.

===1917 Revolution===

In 1917, Joffe, freed from the Siberian exile by the February Revolution, returned to the Crimea. Crimean social democrats sent him to the capital, Petrograd, to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it impossible for him to remain in an organization dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.

In May 1917, Joffe and Trotsky temporarily joined Mezhraiontsy who merged with the Bolsheviks at the VI Bolshevik Party Congress held between 26 July and 3 August 1917 (all dates are Old Style until February 1918). At the Congress, Joffe was elected a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee, but two days later, on 5 August, the Central Committee, some of whose members were in prison, in hiding or lived far from Petrograd and could not attend its meetings, made Joffe a member of its permanent (&quot;narrow&quot;) bureau. On 6 August Joffe was made an alternate member of the Central Committee Secretariat and on 20 August made a member of the editorial board of the Bolshevik newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; which was then temporarily called &quot;Proletary&quot; (&quot;Proletarian&quot;) for legal reasons.

Joffe headed the Bolshevik faction in the Petrograd Duma (city government) in the fall of 1917 and was one of the Duma&#x27;s delegates to the Democratic Conference between 14 and 22 September. Although Joffe, along with Lenin and Trotsky, opposed the Bolsheviks&#x27; participation in the consultative Pre-parliament created by the Democratic Conference, the motion was carried by the majority of Bolshevik deputies at the Democratic Conference and Joffe was made a Bolshevik member of the Pre-parliament. Two weeks later, on 7 October, once the more radical Bolshevik faction gained the upper hand, Joffe and other Bolsheviks walked out of the Pre-parliament.

In October 1917, Joffe supported Lenin&#x27;s and Trotsky&#x27;s revolutionary position against Grigory Zinoviev&#x27;s and Lev Kamenev&#x27;s more moderate position, demanding that the latter be expelled from the Central Committee after an apparent breach of party discipline. Joffe served as the Chairman of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee which overthrew the Russian Provisional Government on 25–26 October 1917. Immediately after the revolution, he supported Lenin and Trotsky against Zinoviev, Kamenev, Alexei Rykov and other Bolshevik Central Committee members who would have shared power with other socialist parties.

===Brest-Litovsk===

From 30 November 1917 until January 1918, Joffe was the head of the Soviet delegation that was sent to Brest-Litovsk to negotiate an end to the hostilities with Germany. On 22 December 1917 Joffe announced the following Bolshevik pre-conditions for a peace treaty:

*No forcible annexation of territories seized in the war
*Restore national independence where it was terminated during war
*National groups independent before the war should be allowed by referendum to decide question of independence
*Multi-cultural regions should be administered so as to allow all possible cultural independence and self-regulation
*No indemnities. Personal losses should be compensated out of international fund
*Colonial question should be decided according to points 1–4

Although Joffe had signed a ceasefire agreement with the Central Powers on 2 December 1917, he supported Trotsky in the latter&#x27;s refusal to sign a permanent peace treaty in February. Once the Bolshevik Central Committee decided to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 23 February 1918, Joffe remained a member of the Soviet delegation only under protest and in a purely consultative capacity. Grigory Sokolnikov, leader of the signatory team, signed on behalf of Russia.

Remembering Joffe&#x27;s presence with the Bolshevik delegation at Brest-Litovsk, Count Ottokar Czernin, the Austro-Hungarians&#x27; representative would later write:

The leader of the Russian delegation is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application of the right of self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: &#x27;I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...&#x27;

At the VII Extraordinary Congress of the Bolshevik Party between 6 and 8 March 1918, Joffe was re-elected to the Central Committee, but only as a candidate (non-voting) member. He remained in Petrograd when the Soviet government moved to Moscow later in March and worked as a member of the Petrograd Bureau of the Central Committee until he was appointed Soviet representative to Germany in April. He signed the Soviet-German Supplementary Treaty on 27 August 1918. On 6 November 1918, shortly before the Armistice and the German Revolution, the Soviet delegation in Berlin headed by Joffe was expelled from the country on charges of preparing a Communist uprising in Germany. Straight before Joffe left Berlin he rendered Oskar Cohn about 1 million Mark and a 10.5 million Russian ruble mandate for a bank account at Mendelssohn &amp; Co. After the delegation returned to Russia Joffe claimed to have paid this money to the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) to support the revolutionary activities and to purchase weapons. These payments led to the demission of Wilhelm Solf as German minister of Foreign affairs, who refused a further cooperation with the USPD.

===Diplomatic career===
In 1919–1920, Joffe was a member of the Council of Labor and Defense and People&#x27;s Commissar (minister) of State Control of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. He was not re-elected to the Central Committee at the VIII Party Congress in March 1919 and would never again occupy a major leadership position. He negotiated a ceasefire with Poland in October 1920 and peace treaties with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in late 1920. In 1921 he signed the Peace of Riga with Poland, ending the Polish-Soviet War of 1918-1921, and was made deputy chairman of the Turkestan Commission of the VTsIK and Sovnarkom.

Joffe was one of the Soviet delegates at the Genoa Conference in February 1922, an experience he described in a short book published later that same year. After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China (in office: 1922 to 1923 or 1924), as the Soviet troubleshooter (or Kuznetsov) of those days. In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with Sun Yat-Sen in Shanghai on aid to the Kuomintang on the assumption that the latter would cooperate with Chinese Communists, presumably with Lenin&#x27;s approval. While based in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations.
The negotiations proved long and difficult, and ended when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to Great Britain in 1924 and as Soviet representative in Austria in 1924–1926.

In 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He tried to concentrate on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his ill-health.

===Opposition and suicide===

Joffe remained a friend and loyal supporter of Leon Trotsky through the 1920s, joining him in the Left Opposition. By late 1927, he was gravely ill, in extreme pain and confined to his bed. After a refusal by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party to send him abroad for treatment and Trotsky&#x27;s expulsion from the Communist Party on 12 November 1927, he committed suicide on 16 November. He left a farewell letter addressed to Trotsky, but the letter was seized by Soviet secret police agents and later quoted by Stalinists to discredit both Joffe and Trotsky. Trotsky&#x27;s eulogy at Joffe&#x27;s funeral was his last public speech in the Soviet Union.

Joffe&#x27;s wife Maria Joffe was arrested as a left-oppositionist Trotskyist by Stalin&#x27;s security forces, yet she survived to write her memoirs &quot;One Long Night – A Tale of Truth&quot;.
Joffe&#x27;s daughter, Nadezhda Joffe, also an active Trotskyist, survived Stalin&#x27;s prisons and labor camps and published a memoir, &quot;Back in Time: My Life, My Fate, My Epoch&quot;.

<text>David Ranibok Waiau Adeang (born 24 November 1969) is a Nauruan politician, currently serving as President of Nauru. Adeang is the former Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, and Nauru&#x27;s Minister of Finance and Justice, as well as the Minister Assisting the President of Nauru.

==Background and early career==

David&#x27;s father Kennan Adeang, thrice served as President of Nauru. David Adeang began his political career as a lawyer. After all Ubenide seats had been vacated on 6 November 2001, Adeang won a seat in the following by-election, ousting Joseph Hiram while the other three previous MPs regained their seats. In the parliamentary elections of May 2003, amidst political and economic turmoil, the Naoero Amo won 3 of the 18 seats, and Adeang was one of the elected members. The Naoero Amo entered a coalition with Ludwig Scotty and his supporters. Scotty became president and Adeang minister of finance in May 2003. He was the finance minister and Minister Assisting the President of Nauru only for three months, however, as Scotty&#x27;s government fell in August 2003, and Kinza Clodumar became finance minister.

In April 2004, Adeang was charged with sedition along with Kieren Keke and Fabian Ribauw after a protest at Nauru&#x27;s airport. He was the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru from May 2004 to June 2004. In June 2004 Clodumar and the Naoero Amo united to re-elect Scotty as president. Clodumar remained finance minister, while Adeang became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Justice. Also, the charges against Adeang and the others were dropped. His appointment as foreign minister is interesting because he was the first foreign minister not to be the President of Nauru. That post had been given to the President since Nauru gained independence in 1968. Adeang was easily re-elected to Parliament from the Ubenide constituency in the October 2004 elections. Later that month, he left the position of justice minister, became finance minister, and retained the position of foreign minister.

He was a founding member of the Nauru First party, at one time the only political party on the island.

==Developments in 2007==

Adeang was easily reelected in the August 2007 parliamentary election. He received the most votes in the Ubenide constituency, which elects 4 seats.

===Praise of Cuba===

In September 2007, Adeang, as Foreign Minister, made a number of public statements deemed in the United States to be controversial. He extolled Cuba and criticized US foreign policy, during a visit to the Caribbean island.

===Report of criticism of Adeang by US State Department===

The US Department of State, referring to events investigated in 2007, reported criticism of Adeang in its Human Rights Report, issued for 2008. This criticism was included in the State Department&#x27;s report, despite the fact that police, having undertaken an investigation of allegations of wrongdoing, made no attempt to prosecute Adeang.

===Involvement with the demise of the Scotty government===

Allegations of misconduct on the part of Adeang and Scotty&#x27;s unwillingness to act against Adeang led to the resignation of several members of the government—Kieren Keke, Frederick Pitcher, and Roland Kun—and an unsuccessful motion of no-confidence against Scotty&#x27;s government on 13 November 2007. Although a majority of those voting supported the motion (eight in favor, seven opposed), it fell short of the necessary nine votes. However, another vote on 19 December was successful in ousting Scotty, and Marcus Stephen was elected president; Stephen named Kieren Keke to replace Adeang as Foreign Minister.

==Developments in 2008==

===Alliance with former President Rene Harris===

In an unusual alliance, in March 2008 Adeang and former President Rene Harris moved to attempt a motion of no confidence in President Marcus Stephen, which was, however, thwarted by the resignation of the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru. It was noted that Adeang had been a strong critic of Harris&#x27;s record in government.

===Appointment as Parliamentary Speaker===

Subsequently, in March 2008, Adeang was appointed Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, succeeding Riddell Akua. He entered office on 20 March 2008.

On 22 March, Adeang called a Parliamentary session, allegedly without informing government ministers, who therefore did not attend. Opposition MPs, Adeang included, constituted a majority of legislators present, and passed a ruling outlawing dual citizenship for Members of Parliament. The ruling, if applied, would affect senior Cabinet ministers Kieren Keke and Frederick Pitcher. Were they compelled to resign from Parliament, the Opposition would control a majority of seats in Parliament. The government rejected the legitimacy of the ruling, stating that it was unconstitutional because of the lack of parliamentary quorum. President Marcus Stephen accused Adeang and the Opposition of passing the ruling &quot;after dark on Easter Saturday&quot;, &quot;under candlelight&quot;. For his part, Adeang asserted that 22 March session of Parliament was valid.

===Claims of a coup d&#x27;état===

On 28 March, Adeang, as Speaker, ordered Keke and Pitcher to vacate their seats in Parliament. They refused to do so, and Adeang suspended the sitting.

On 31 March Adeang claimed that the government had mounted a coup: since the police refused to eject two government ministers from the chamber of Parliament, in accordance with his ruling of 28 March, the rule of Parliament no longer governed the police. The Government, in response, denied the claim, stating that they were awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on the issue.

The crisis continued into early April 2008, with Adeang stating that he would consider the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling as &quot;just an opinion&quot;, and Keke responding that the Supreme Court, not the Speaker, had the jurisdiction to determine a member of Parliament&#x27;s eligibility.

===Adeang questions Supreme Court ruling; suspends President Stephen and his ministers===

On 7 April, it was reported by the government that the Supreme Court had ruled in the government&#x27;s favour, apparently confirming that the law forbidding members of Parliament from holding dual nationality was anticonstitutional and invalid, due to lack of quorum. The Court also reportedly rejected Adeang&#x27;s claim that the courts have no jurisdiction over Parliament. Adeang said that he would seek legal advice before responding to the court&#x27;s ruling.

Relations between Adeang, as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, and the Stephen Administration, remained under severe strain following the ruling, and the Administration&#x27;s ministers continued to exercise executive powers without the support of Parliament.

Following 7 April release of the Supreme Court decision which ruled against the dual nationality law, with the passing of which Adeang was particularly identified, Adeang indicated that forty years of post-independence Parliamentary precedent had been set aside. For its part, the government of Marcus Stephen strongly welcomed the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling: whether or not for ideological and principled reasons also, it was seen as ensuring the immediate survival of the Administration.

On 10 April, following allegations of unruly behaviour in the chamber of the Parliament of Nauru, Adeang, as Speaker, suspended President Marcus Stephen from Parliament, along with all members who supported Stephen&#x27;s Administration. On 18 April, Stephen declared a state of emergency, dissolved Parliament, and announced fresh elections. In so doing, President Stephen claimed to be seeking a way out of the impasse which has characterized the relationship between the Government and the Parliament of Nauru, since the Stephen Administration lost a working majority there. For Adeang, the step was one which he had been advocating for several weeks.

===Replacement as Speaker===

Adeang was replaced as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru by Riddell Akua (who also preceded him as Speaker), following the elections of 26 April 2008, when President Marcus Stephen increased his support.

===Loss of ally===

With the death in July 2008 of former President Rene Harris, David Adeang lost an important ally with whom he had closely worked in the earlier part of 2008.

==Developments in 2013==

===Waqa Cabinet===

Following the 2013 parliamentary elections, in which he was re-elected, Adeang supported the election of Baron Waqa to the presidency. Adeang was appointed to the cabinet by Waqa, and was given the portfolios of Finance and Sustainable Development, Justice, and ministerial responsibility for the Eigigu Holdings Corporation and the Nauru Air Corporation. He was also appointed Minister Assisting the President of Nauru.

In July, as Waqa was out of the country, Adeang, as acting president, took the controversial decision of banning Nauruan media from broadcasting an interview in which Opposition MP Mathew Batsiua criticised the government&#x27;s sacking of the chief of police. This act of censorship drew international media attention, and was condemned by the Opposition.

A few days later, Adeang once more banned an interview from being aired - this time, an interview of Opposition MP Kieren Keke criticising an agreement between the Nauruan and Australian governments over the resettlement in Nauru of foreign refugees arriving by boat in Australia. Adeang saw to the broadcasting of an interview in which he himself gave the government&#x27;s position on the agreement, but did not allow the Opposition&#x27;s view to be aired. He explained: &quot;Kieren&#x27;s interpretation about the MOU [memorandum of understanding with Australia] does not necessarily match our interpretation of the MOU, and I think ours is the right one&quot;.

==Presidency==
On 25 October 2023, a vote of no-confidence passed through parliament against President Russ Kun. Following the vote, the parliament was unable to break a tie in their vote for president. On the next day of voting, 30 October, there was another vote for president, with a tie between MP Delvin Thoma and Adeang. In the next vote, Adeang won with ten votes to Thoma&#x27;s eight.

Adeang was sworn into office on 31 October. He announced his cabinet the same day.

<text>Hans Ledwinka (14 February 1878 – 2 March 1967) was an Austrian automobile designer.

== Youth ==
Ledwinka was born in Klosterneuburg (Lower Austria), near Vienna, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

He started his career as a mechanic, and later studied in Vienna. As a young man he worked for Nesselsdorfer-Wagenbau in Kopřivnice, then Nesselsdorf, in Moravia, the company that later became Tatra. He was first employed in the construction of railroad cars, and later involved in the production of the first cars made by this firm. He designed the 5.3-litre, six-cylinder Type U motor car. In the midst of World War I in May 1916 he accepted directorship at Steyr, initially working at home and moving there permanently in 1917.

== Chief designer at Tatra ==

Ledwinka returned to Tatra company (originally Nesselsdorfer-Wagenbau) in Kopřivnice (Nesselsdorf), then in Czechoslovakia, and between 1921 and 1937 he was their chief design engineer. He invented the frameless central tubular chassis (so-called &quot;backbone chassis&quot;) with swing axles, fully independent suspension and rear-mounted air-cooled flat engine. Another of Ledwinka&#x27;s major contributions to automobile design was the streamlined car body. Under him, Tatra brought the first mass-produced streamlined cars to market. With his son Erich, who became chief designer at Tatra, Ledwinka and Erich Übelacker, a German engineer also employed by Tatra, designed the streamlined Tatra models T77, T77a, T87, and T97, which had rear-mounted air-cooled engines.

== Final years ==
After WWII Ledwinka was accused of collaboration with the German occupation forces and jailed for five years in Czechoslovakia. After his release in 1951, he refused to work for Tatra, and retired to Munich, Germany where he died in 1967.

== The legacy ==
In 2007 Hans Ledwinka was inducted in the .

Ledwinka&#x27;s son Erich, was also a car designer. He designed the unique Haflinger for Steyr-Daimler-Puch, as well as the larger Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle. Both utilize tubular chassis and swing portal axles.

<doc id="785332" wikidata="Q44647" url="?curid=785332" title="Otfried Preußler">
<text>Otfried Preußler (; sometimes spelled Preussler; born Otfried Syrowatka; 20 October 1923 – 18 February 2013) was a German children&#x27;s books author. More than 50 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide and they have been translated into 55 languages. His best-known works are &quot;The Robber Hotzenplotz&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Mill&quot; (&quot;Krabat&quot;).

== Life and work ==
He was born in Liberec (Reichenberg), Czechoslovakia. His mother Erna Syrowatka, née Tscherwenka, and his father Josef Syrowatka were both teachers. They changed their family name from the Czech Syrowatka to the German Preußler in 1941 during the Nazi occupation of the country. After he graduated school in 1942, in the midst of World War II, he was drafted into the German Army. Although he survived the military action on the Eastern Front, he was taken prisoner as a 21-year-old lieutenant in 1944. He spent the next five years in various POW camps in the Tatar Republic.

After his release in June 1949, he found his displaced relatives and his fiancée, Annelies Kind in the Bavarian town of Rosenheim. They married that same year.

Between 1953 and 1970, he was initially a primary school teacher, then a school principal in Rosenheim. There his talents as a storyteller and illustrator were put to good use, and often the stories he told the children would later be written down and published.

He won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1972 for &quot;Krabat&quot;.

Preußler resided in Haidholzen, near Rosenheim.

Over 15.2 million copies of his books have been sold in the German language, and his works have been translated into over 55 other languages.

Having essentially retired from writing stories, which had become his main occupation, he undertook the relation of his experiences as a prisoner in the POW camps; those memoirs are to be published after his death.

==Legacy==
22 schools are named after him, e. g.
A Gymnasium (grammar school) is named after him (the &quot;Otfried Preußler Gymnasium Pullach&quot;, in Pullach, Bavaria, Germany) and a Grundschule (primary school) is named Otfried Preußler Schule in Bad Soden.

On 20 October 2017, Google celebrated his 94th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="785372" wikidata="Q2735638" url="?curid=785372" title="Christmas stocking">
<text>A Christmas stocking is an empty sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Saint Nicholas Day or Christmas Eve so that Saint Nicholas (or the related figures of Santa Claus and Father Christmas) can fill it with small toys, candy, fruit, coins or other small gifts when he arrives. These small items are often referred to as stocking stuffers or stocking fillers. The tradition of the Christmas stocking is thought to originate from the life of Saint Nicholas. In some Christmas stories, the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus; in other stories (and in tradition), some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree. Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece or pile of coal. Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep.

==History==

Christmas stockings were mentioned as an established American tradition as early as 1823 in the poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;. The origin of the Christmas stocking is thought to originate in the life of Saint Nicholas. While there are no written records of the origin of the Christmas stocking, there are popular legends that attempt to tell the history of the Christmas tradition. One such legend has several variations, but the following is a good example: Saint Nicholas was staying with a poor family and heard that the father was planning to sell his three daughters into prostitution to save them all from starvation. Saint Nicholas wanted to help but knew that the old man would not accept charity, so he decided to help in secret. When he left the house after dark he threw three bags of gold through an open window; one landed in a stocking. When the girls and their father woke up the next morning they found the bags of gold and were, of course, overjoyed. The girls were saved from their sad fate. Other versions of the story say that Saint Nicholas threw the three bags of gold directly into the stockings, which were hung by the fireplace to dry.

This led to the custom of children hanging stockings or putting out shoes, eagerly awaiting gifts from Saint Nicholas. Sometimes the story is told with gold balls instead of bags of gold; this variation is why three gold balls, sometimes represented as oranges, are one of the symbols for Saint Nicholas. This is also the origin of three gold balls being used as a symbol for pawnbrokers.

A tradition that began in a European country originally, children simply used one of their everyday socks, but eventually special Christmas stockings were created for this purpose. These stockings are traditionally used on Saint Nicholas Day although in the early 1800s, they also came to be used on Christmas Eve.

An unsubstantiated claim is that the Christmas stocking custom derived from the Germanic/Scandinavian figure Odin. According to Phyllis Siefker, children would place their boots, filled with carrots, straw, or sugar, near the chimney for Odin&#x27;s flying horse, Sleipnir, to eat. Odin would reward those children for their kindness by replacing Sleipnir&#x27;s food with gifts or candy. This practice, she claims, survived in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands after the adoption of Christianity and became associated with Saint Nicholas as a result of the process of Christianization. This claim is doubtful as there are no records of stocking-filling practices related to Odin until there is a merging of Saint Nicholas with Odin. Saint Nicholas had an earlier merging with the Grandmother cult in Bari, Italy, where the grandmother would put gifts in stockings. This merged Saint Nicholas would later travel north and merge with the Odin cults.

==Present day==

Today, stores carry a large variety of styles and sizes of Christmas stockings, and Christmas stockings are also a popular homemade craft. Many families create their own Christmas stockings with each family member&#x27;s name applied to the stocking so that Santa will know which stocking belongs to which family member.

<text>Crackerjack is a British children&#x27;s television series which was initially aired on the BBC Television Service between 14 September 1955 and 21 December 1984 (with no series in 1971). The series was a variety show featuring comedy sketches, singers and quizzes, broadcast live with an audience.

&quot;Crackerjack&quot; returned in 2020. It was hosted by Sam &amp; Mark, with an exclamation mark added to its original title, and aired on CBBC from 17 January. The second revived series aired from December 2020 to March 2021.

Its initial long run featured Eamonn Andrews, Max Bygraves, Leslie Crowther, Ed &quot;Stewpot&quot; Stewart, Jack Douglas, Stu Francis, Peter Glaze, Don Maclean, Michael Aspel, Little and Large, Jan Hunt, The Krankies, Basil Brush, Geoffrey Durham, Bernie Clifton, and Ronnie Corbett, amongst many others.

Performers who appeared as singers/dancers, assisting the host with games, included Sally Ann Triplett (Series 26), Julie Dorne-Brown (Series 27–28), and Ling Tai (Series 29).

==Format==

The shows were frantic, being broadcast live in front of an audience largely of children, originally at the King&#x27;s Theatre on Hammersmith Road, London, used by the BBC as the King&#x27;s Studio for live and recorded broadcasts until 1963, then at the BBC Television Theatre (since renamed the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire). The format of the programme included competitive games for teams of children, a music spot, a comedy double act, and a finale in which the cast performs a short comic play, adapting popular songs of the day and incorporating them into the action. The whole audience would shout &quot;Crackerjack!&quot; whenever anybody said the word.

One of the games was a quiz called Double or Drop, where each of three contestants was given a prize to hold for each question answered correctly, but given a cabbage if incorrect. They were out of the game if they dropped any of the items awarded or received a third cabbage. While the winner took his or her pick from a basket of toys, every runner-up won a much-envied marbled propelling pencil as a prize, which became so popular that in 1961 Queen Elizabeth II, who visited the programme, was presented with &quot;Crackerjack&quot; pencils for her children Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

During the early 1970s, high-profile pop guests included The Sweet, Mud, Gary Glitter and, on more than one occasion, Slade.

In 1982, in a bid to boost flagging ratings, &quot;Crackerjack&quot; introduced gunge into its games and launched a new game called Take a Chance in which the celebrity guests – one female, one male – could score extra points for the contestant they teamed up with by competing against Stu Francis in a quickfire question tie. A wrong answer or the opponent answering first would lead to Francis or the celebrity guest being covered in gunge. The gunge was always given a name relating to a random theme or to the celebrity guest (Howling Wind for Ian McCaskill, for example).

The format of the final Series 27-29 was revived in all but name by Francis in 1987 for Border Television series &quot;Crush A Grape&quot;. Francis also toured a live version of his era&#x27;s format for some time after the BBC cancellation, initially under the &quot;Crackerjack&quot; name but later as &quot;The All Star Laughter Show&quot;.

==Transmissions==
===Original===
Only 148 out of 451 episodes from the original 29 series of the show survive in the BBC archives. The earliest episode known to exist is Episode 12 of series 3 with Eamonn Andrews; of his tenure, Episode 16 of Series 6, Episode 2 of Series 7, Episode 3 of Series 8 and Episodes 1 and 17 of Series 9 also survive. None of the Leslie Crowther episodes are known to exist, and two episodes only (Episodes 12–13 of Series 18) of the Michael Aspel period survive. All of the Ed Stewart (Series 19–24) and Stu Francis (Series 25–29) periods remain.

<text>Jaime Elizabeth Pressly (born July 30, 1977) is an American actress and model. Known for her role as Joy Turner on the NBC sitcom &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; (2005–2009), she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and garnered nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She has appeared in such films as &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; (1998), &quot;Inferno&quot; (1999), &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), &quot;The Karate Dog&quot; (2004), and &quot;I Love You, Man&quot; (2009). For her portrayal of Jill Kendall on the CBS sitcom &quot;Mom&quot; (2014–2021), she was nominated for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Early life and modeling==
Pressly was born in Kinston, North Carolina, the daughter of Brenda Sue (née Smith), a dance instructor, and James Liston Pressly, a car salesman. In 1992, she moved with her family to Costa Mesa, California, where she spent the first semester of her high school sophomore year. She spent her childhood and early teenage years training as a gymnast, which led her to modeling jobs. At age 14, she appeared on her first cover, &quot;Teen Magazine&quot;, and became the spokesmodel for the International Cover Model Search. At 15, she dropped out of school and went to Japan on a modeling contract. She succeeded in having herself legally emancipated from her parents at 15 so she could travel to Japan, as neither of her parents could make the trip.

==Acting career==
===1997–2004: Career beginnings===
After making an uncredited appearance in &quot;Baywatch&quot; in 1995, followed by filming a cameo in the film &quot;Mercenary&quot; in 1996, Pressly starred as Violet, a vengeful seductress, in the 1997 direct-to-DVD film &quot;Poison Ivy: The New Seduction&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; series. After a small role in the teen cult classic &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot;, television appearances followed, with guest roles in the short-lived &quot;Push&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;. She went on to play one of the leads in &quot;Jack &amp; Jill&quot;, which aired for two seasons, from September 26, 1999, to April 15, 2001, on The WB. Pressly headlined the independent film &quot;Poor White Trash&quot; (2000), playing scheming gold-digger Sandy Lake, and appeared in three 2001 theatrical releases aimed at a teenage audience, which despite varying degrees of success, helped her receive more exposure. The parody film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, most notably, featured her as Priscilla, a high school cheerleader opposite Chris Evans, while she took on the roles of a young wife in the sex comedy &quot;Tomcats&quot; and that of a Southern love interest in the comedy &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, opposite David Spade.

In 2002, Pressly starred as a college student trapped in a haunted island in the independent horror film &quot;Demon Island&quot;. Felix Vasquez of &quot;Cinema Crazed&quot; regarded it as a guilty pleasure and stated: &quot;[She] does what she can with her character and comes off as a rather charming character&quot;. She next portrayed a crazed, motorcycle-riding criminal in the action thriller &quot;Torque&quot; (2004), alongside Ice Cube. In a profile, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, describing this phase of her career, asserted: &quot;She is typically cast on the strength of her looks and her Southern sassiness, and she has had girlfriend roles in several forgettable teensploitation flicks&quot;.

===2005–2009: Breakthrough===

Between 2005 and 2009, Pressly played Joy Turner, the pessimistic, cold-hearted, stubborn and vain ex-wife of a small-time thief, in the NBC sitcom &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, which was a success with critics and audiences. She garnered nominations for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award, and in 2007, she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on the show. Pressly once called her role her &quot;greatest release&quot; and thanked creator Greg Garcia for restoring her faith in the business. She remarked: &quot;[The series] came at a time when I was questioning whether this was the path I wanted to continue following. I was tired of living out of my suitcase, coming and going all the time. I wanted a little normalcy in my life.&quot;

During the early run of &quot;My Name is Earl&quot;, Pressly produced and took on the role of a homicidal magazine editor in the independent film &quot;Death to the Supermodels&quot; (2005), a role she compared to that of Reese Witherspoon in &quot;Election&quot;. In his review for the film, Scott Weinberg of DVDTalk.com, wrote: &quot;Jaime Pressly is a funny, funny woman. To those of you &quot;My Name is Earl&quot; fans who are just now discovering the juicy talents of the perpetually sneering, eye-rolling, attitude machine known as Jaime Pressly, I&#x27;d recommend you check out her work in flicks like &quot;Ringmaster&quot;, &quot;Tomcats&quot;, &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;, &quot;Torque&quot;, and &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. Basically, if we were giving out an award for &quot;the consistently best thing in a series of generally atrocious comedies,&quot; Jaime would be walking home with that prize, no sweat. Regardless of how bad the movie is [...] Jaime always seems like a kooky and kinetic cartoon character who somehow figured out how to become flesh &amp; blood. Yes, she&#x27;s sexy and all that, but Jaime Pressly is also funny, and that just amplifies all her other assets&quot;.

In &quot;&quot; (2006), a British-German martial arts action film based on a Japanese video game franchise of the same name, Pressly starred as one of four female fighters working together to uncover the secret that the organizer of an invitational martial arts contest is trying to hide. While the film was relatively successful on some markets, it only found a limited audience in North America. In 2006, she also hosted the first annual &quot;VH1 Rock Honors&quot;, and an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and guest-starred on &quot;MADtv&quot;, playing Hillary Clinton in a parody of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Dubya&quot;, in which George W. Bush (Frank Caliendo) makes a list of all the bad things he has done in the past and rectifies them one by one. She voiced a bird in the animated comedy film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008).

In &quot;I Love You, Man&quot; (2009), Pressly starred opposite Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, as the best friend of a bride-to-be and one half of a volatile married couple. The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing US$92 million worldwide. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found her &quot;terrific&quot; in her role, asserting: &quot;Her battles with [her on-screen husband] have genuine comic bite&quot;.

===2010–present: Continued television roles===
The ABC Family television film &quot;Beauty &amp; the Briefcase&quot; (2010), co-starring Hilary Duff, featured Pressly as a primary editor at &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. The premiere received 2.4 million viewers attracting a strong female audience that drove the network to an all-time high in viewers. &quot;Smoke Screen&quot;, another 2010 television film, saw her star as a reporter finding herself in the middle of a murder investigation when she wakes up next to a dead body. In 2010, Pressly also guest-starred in two episodes of the CBS comedy &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, as a possible surrogate mother for Jeff and Audrey (Patrick Warburton and Megyn Price).

In &quot;6 Month Rule&quot; (2011), an independent film released for limited theaters and digital markets, Pressly played what was described as a &quot;harridan of an ex-fiancée&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. She appeared in the interactive educational children&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure&quot; (2012), as a flamenco dancer riding a giant flying sombrero. Budgeted at US$20 million, the film only made US$445,000 in more than 2,000 screens during its opening weekend. Pressly next had regular roles in two short-lived series. The Fox sitcom &quot;I Hate My Teenage Daughter&quot; (2011–2012) saw her portray a mother fearing her daughter is turning into the kind of girl who tormented her in high school, while the TV Land comedy &quot;Jennifer Falls&quot; (2014) featured her as a single mother, who after being fired from a high-paying job, becomes a waitress in her brother&#x27;s bar.

Pressly obtained leading roles in three 2014 film releases. In &quot;A Haunted House 2&quot;, Pressly starred as a mother of two and one half of an interracial couple, alongside Marlon Wayans. She had known Wayans for 15 years prior filming and the project marked the first time they worked together. Describing the process, she said: &quot;It was a match made in heaven. It really was. We&#x27;re both high energy, and we both like to do something new every take, and when you do comedy like this, where you get to improv the majority of the time, it&#x27;s about trying to one-up each other, and that makes for a really great comedy&quot;. The film was panned by critics, but was a decent box office success. She starred opposite singer Robin Thicke in the romantic comedy &quot;Making the Rules&quot;, which was filmed in 2012. &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, a television horror film, saw Pressly play a divorced mother whose life is thrown into turmoil when her young daughter becomes obsessed with an evil doll left behind by the previous owners.

From 2014 to 2021, Pressly portrayed Jill Kendall, a wealthy socialite and alcoholic, in the CBS sitcom &quot;Mom&quot;. &quot;Mom&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim and ran for eight seasons. Created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre, the show followed a group of women recovering from addiction. On August 4, 2022, Fox announced that Pressly had joined the cast of the sitcom &quot;Welcome to Flatch&quot; as a series regular for the second season.

== Other ventures ==

=== Fashion ===
In 2003, Pressly launched a lingerie line, J&#x27;aime by Jaime Pressly, and expanded it to clothing and sleepwear. In 2007, &quot;People&quot; magazine called her spring/summer clothing line a &quot;sophisticated and star-studded fashion show&quot; and &quot;one of the biggest shows of L.A. Fashion Week.&quot; In spring 2008, she launched a second clothing line, J&#x27;aime Collection. &quot;I&#x27;ve always had an interest in design, and I have always loved creating things,&quot; Pressly said in an interview with &quot;Redbook&quot; in 2008. She ended her clothing lines in September 2008.

== In the media ==
In a 2008 interview with &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine, Pressly credited her success for &quot;lifelong willingness to defy convention.&quot;

Pressly&#x27;s appearance has often been the subject of media attention. She has appeared on several lists for world&#x27;s most beautiful or sexiest women. Her changing looks and style have received noteworthy praise from periodicals such as &quot;InStyle&quot;.

In 2000, she became a spokesmodel for Liz Claiborne Cosmetics and advertised the company&#x27;s fragrance &quot;Lucky You&quot;. In 2008, she appeared in an infomercial for Susan Lucci&#x27;s &quot;Youthful Essence&quot; personal microdermabrasion kit, and an advertisement for Axe in 2010. She has graced the covers of numerous magazines, including &quot;InStyle Weddings&quot;, &quot;Ocean Drive&quot;, &quot;Health&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Shape&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pressly has revealed in interviews that she briefly struggled with bulimia as a teenager.

In 2005, she began dating Eric Calvo. They were friends for more than nine years prior. On May 11, 2007, in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Pressly gave birth to their son. In November 2008, the couple announced their separation.

Nine months later, in July 2009, Pressly announced her engagement to entertainment lawyer Simran Singh. They married on September 26, 2009, at the Dick Clark estate, on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. On January 21, 2011, Pressly filed for divorce from Singh, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in November 2011.

In October 2017, Pressly gave birth to twin sons with her longtime boyfriend Hamzi Hijazi.

===Legal issues===
On January 5, 2011, two weeks before filing for divorce, Pressly was arrested in Santa Monica, California, for suspicion of driving under the influence. She eventually pleaded no contest and received three years of informal probation.

<text>Area codes 315 and 680 are telephone area codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the north-central area of the U.S. state of New York. Area code 315 was installed as one of the original North American area codes in 1947, while area code 680 was added to the numbering plan area (NPA) in an overlay plan in 2017.

The service area extends from the western side of Wayne County to Little Falls, north to the Canada–United States border, east to Massena and south to near Cortland. Most of the area&#x27;s population lives in Syracuse and its suburbs. Other major population areas include Utica and Watertown.

==History==
Area code 315 was one of the original North American area codes created in 1947, when it was assigned to a numbering plan area (NPA) in central New York state that extended from the Canadian border with Ontario and Quebec southward to the Pennsylvania state line, including Binghamton and Syracuse. During 1954, its southern portion, including Binghamton, was combined with the southeastern corner of numbering plan area 716 in an area code split that created area code 607.

New York State regulators announced that 315 was threatened by numbering exhaustion for the third quarter of 2010. The New York State Public Service Commission at the time weighed two options, an overlay plan or a split plan. A numbering plan area division would have included a north-south arrangement, dividing Oswego County and the north from 315, or an east-west division, with Oswego and Onondaga forming the boundary. Regulators met to discuss a second code in the 315 region. Due to economic conditions, assignable numbers were not depleted during the third quarter of 2010 as projected. The revised exhaustion was estimated for 2017. On March 11, 2017, area code 680 was introduced, creating the first overlay in the upstate region.

Since 2017, telephone callers must dial ten digits for local calls for using most telephone services including Verizon and Charter Spectrum. Attempts to make a seven-digit call with these services activates an intercept message reminding them of the new rule. As of January 12, 2021, there were still some smaller phone services whose customers were still able to use seven digit dialing within area code 315 and connect to the person they were dialing.

As of 2020, very few if any numbers in the 680 area code were in use.

On March 15, 2022, a proclamation by Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh and Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon declared recognition of &#x27;315 day&#x27;.

<doc id="785456" wikidata="Q4655458" url="?curid=785456" title="A Big Hunk o' Love">
<text>&quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot; is a song originally recorded by Elvis Presley and released as a single on June 23, 1959 by RCA Victor, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks.

The song was revived by Presley in 1972 during his engagements at the Las Vegas Hilton in February 1972 and was used regularly in his live shows until mid-1973. It was performed live for the last time on January 26, 1974. The song is included in the 1972 documentary &quot;Elvis On Tour&quot; and his 1973 show broadcast via satellite, &quot;Aloha from Hawaii&quot;. During this time period, it was played by the Elvis&#x27; TCB Band, and featured Glen D. Hardin and James Burton.

The song was written by Aaron Schroeder and Sidney Wyche, under the name Sid Jaxon and published by Elvis Presley&#x27;s company Gladys Music, Inc. Aaron Schroeder (along with Wally Gold), also wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot; and &quot;Good Luck Charm&quot;, both of which, like &quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot;, were originally recorded by American rock and roll icon Elvis Presley.

Syd Wyche is best known for writing the jazz standard &quot;Alright, Okay, You Win&quot;, whereas Aaron Schroeder co-wrote many hits in the rock`n`roll area, from &quot;Fools Hall of Fame&quot; (Pat Boone) to &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot; (Duane Eddy). In an interview conducted by Jan-Erik Kjeseth, he also revealed that in fact he worked with his partner Wally Gold in order to improve a song submitted by another writer, and the result was &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;, a big hit for Lesley Gore. Schroeder and Gold tossed a coin as to whose name should go on the record, and Gold &quot;won&quot;.

The song appeared on the 1959 compilation &quot;50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, the 2002 career retrospective &quot;ELV1S: 30#1 Hits&quot;, and the 2016 compilation &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;.

== Recording ==
&quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot;, a hard, driving rocker, was recorded at Elvis&#x27; first and only session during his two years of Army service. The session took place on June 10, 1958, in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the first session that did not include guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, who had both worked with Elvis since his first recordings for Sam Phillips at the Memphis Recording Service, which later became known as Sun Studios.

The recording featured Elvis&#x27; drummer D.J. Fontana and backing vocalists the Jordanaires, who would continue to work with Elvis until Elvis&#x27; appearance at the Hilton in Las Vegas. The rest of the musicians were noted Nashville session men, such as guitarist Hank Garland on a Gibson Byrdland guitar, Floyd Cramer on piano, Bob Moore on double bass, and Buddy Harman and D.J. Fontana on drums. The song was recorded in four takes, the released version is actually spliced from takes three and four.

==Personnel==
*Elvis Presley – lead vocals, rhythm guitar
*Chet Atkins – rhythm guitar
*Hank Garland – lead guitar
*Bob Moore – double bass
*D.J. Fontana, Buddy Harman – drums
*Floyd Cramer – piano
*Steve Sholes – producer
*Bob Ferris – engineer

== Release and chart performance ==
RCA Victor had paired &quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot; for release as a single with &quot;My Wish Came True&quot; as the B-side in both the United States and England. When the single was released on June 23, it was the third release to come from Elvis&#x27; army session after &quot;I Got Stung&quot; on October 21, 1958, and &quot;I Need Your Love Tonight&quot; b/w &quot;(Now and Then There&#x27;s) A Fool Such as I&quot; on March 10, 1959.

The A-side spent two weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 while the B-side peaked at No. 12. The single was less successful on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 with the A-side peaking at No. 2 and the B-side at No. 23. On the UK Singles Chart the A-side peaked at No. 4, while the B-side did not appear on the chart. The A-side also peaked at No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B Singles chart.

Presley&#x27;s next single was another Aaron Schroeder co-composition, &quot;Stuck on You&quot;. &quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot; was the first of four of Schroeder&#x27;s songs that became No. 1 hits for Presley.

&quot;A Big Hunk o&#x27; Love&quot; b/w &quot;My Wish Came True&quot; was Presley&#x27;s last commercially released Canadian 78 RPM. It was Elvis&#x27; first single to not receive a 78 RPM pressing in the United States.

<text>[[Magtymguly]] Pyragy ( &quot;Makhdumqoli Farāghi&quot;; ; ; , born Magtymguly, was an Iranian-Turkmen spiritual leader, philosophical poet, Sufi and traveller, who is considered the most famous figure in Turkmen literary history.

Magtymguly is the greatest representative of Turkmen literature, credited with the creation of Turkmen written literature, and whose literary form became a powerful symbol of the historical and the incipient national consciousness of the Turkmen people. He is part of a unique period in the cultural history of Central Asia, with his exceptional talent projecting his personal poetic synthesis onto the next generation of poets of the region. The poems of the Turkmen poet have been translated into many languages of the world, including English, Russian, Kyrgyz, Romanian.

In a wider context, Magtymguly is often placed alongside major figures of the Turkic literary world such as Hoja Ahmad Yasawi, Yunus Emre, Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i and Fizuli.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Magtymguly was born in Haji Qushan, a village near the city of Gonbad-e Qabus in the modern-day province of Golestan, Iran, the northern steppes of which are known as Turkmen Sahra (Turkmen steppes). It was part of the extensive Safavid Empire in the first half of the 18th century.

Magtymguly&#x27;s name, signifying &quot;slave of Magtym,&quot; derives from one of the revered lineages within the Turkmen community. In addition to his given name, the poet adopted a distinctive pen name or makhlas, &quot;Feraghi,&quot; in his literary works. It comes from Arabic and means &quot;the one separated from&quot; happiness, or union with his beloved.

Magtymguly&#x27;s father was , himself an educated poet. His father was also a local teacher and mullah, and was highly regarded by his people.

Magtymguly received his early education in the Turkmen, Persian and Arabic languages from his father. He also learned ancestral trades such as felt-making and, according to some sources, jewellery.

Magtymguly continued his studies in various madrassahs (religious school of higher learning), including Idris Baba madrassah in the village of , madrassah in Bukhara and madrassah in Khiva.
Magtymguly provided basic information about himself, his family and children in his poetry. In his poem &quot;&quot; (Known in the world), Magtymguly says: &quot;Tell those who enquire about me that I am a Gerkez, I hail from Etrek and my name is Magtymguly&quot;, identifying his homeland as the banks of the Etrek River and expressing his identity through his tribe.

=== Later life ===
Magtymguly traveled extensively during his lifetime, mostly to widen his erudition, with the territories of present-day Azerbaijan, India, Iran and Uzbekistan among the countries known to have been visited by him.

Not much is known about Magtymguly&#x27;s family life. He was unable to marry a woman he loved from his own village, , whom he dedicated a great deal of his love poems.

The following is the excerpt from Magtymguly&#x27;s (Separated) poem dedicated to (in original Turkmen and its English translation):
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
I am separated from my flower.
From my black-haired beauty,
From my nice-voiced nightingale,
I am separated from my sweet-talking love.&lt;/poem&gt;
Magtymguly died in 1807. His resting place is in the village of Aq Taqeh-ye Qadim, in Golestan Province, Iran. Nowadays, his tomb is the site of pilgrimages at which prayers and Sufi &quot;dhikrs&quot; are performed by members of different ethnic groups.

== Sufism and mysticism ==

A number of Magtymguly&#x27;s poems display Sufistic philosophical attitudes that stress certain teachings and practices of the Quran and the sunnah, describing ethical and spiritual goals.

A number of Magtymguly&#x27;s ghazals, however, when taken out of context, seem to make antinomian statements with regard to religion. Despite this, Magtymguly should not be compared to an Uzbek poet Mashrab, who was an antinomian heterodox Sufi and hanged in 1712, nor should he be compared to an Iraqi Turkmen poet Nesimi, who adopted self-deification stance. Antinomian heterodoxy appears not to be the major trend in Magtymguly&#x27;s poetry. His conventional stand, in fact, is the Sufi station of &quot;khajrat&quot; (bewilderment).

The following is an excerpt from Magtymguly&#x27;s poem is an exemplary work containing all of the familiar Sufi elements:
&lt;poem&gt;
.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Makhtumquli is drunk with love of You
His dazzled eye stares in amazement at his Friend
In the nine spheres above the seven earths,
Oh Lord, will I hear from You&lt;/poem&gt; 

The following verse is a call to follow the &quot;sunnah&quot;, where Magtymguly also uses the &quot;laqab&quot; of (Feraghi-in-love). Note: The first four lines is the original (Turkmen) language of the poem written using Arabic alphabet as in one of the earliest manuscripts, while next are in modern Turkmen alphabet; English translation is provided further down.

:1
:
:
: Feraghi-in-love will state his will,
: Our sacred duty is to pray and fast,

:2
:
: 
: We have this debt on our shoulders,
: Let&#x27;s return it before we leave!

In the poem below, called (I&#x27;d Like to Feel the Wind of Dawn), all three people Magtymguly wishes to have seen (known) are considered prominent figures in Sufism, with Bahauddin being the founder of one of the largest Sufi Sunni orders, the Naqshbandi.
&lt;poem&gt;
.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
I&#x27;d like to feel the wind of dawn,
On the hills of Dehestan,
I&#x27;d like to see Zengi Baba,
Bahauddin, Mirkulal.
&lt;/poem&gt; 
==Political ideals==
Magtymguly lived at a time when Turkmen tribes were displaced from their homeland, and plundered as a result of constant clashes with Iran and Khiva. He deeply resented it and expressed his feelings of repentance in his poems. Indeed, Magtymguly express strong social protest in his poems, but his political thought is mostly directed towards the unification of the Turkmen tribes and the establishment of an independent polity for Turkmens.

==Poetry==

Magtymguly was one of the first Turkmen poets to introduce the use of classical Chagatai, the court language of the Khans of Central Asia, as a literary language, incorporating many Turkmen linguistic features. His poetry exemplifies a trend towards increased use of Turkic languages rather than Persian; he is revered as the founder of Turkmen poetry, literature and language. Magtymguly&#x27;s poetry also gave start to an era litterateurs depict as the &quot;Golden age&quot; in Turkmen literature. His literary form became a powerful symbol of the historical and the incipient national consciousness of the Turkmen people.

Unlike his father and another prominent Turkmen poet of the era, Andalib, Magtymguly employed strophic form, usually quatrains (qoshuk) for his poems making them syllabic. Vast majority of his poems are in the form of folk Turkmen songs, &quot;qoshuk&quot; and &quot;aydish&quot;, with the latter being a form of musical contest usually involving two poets.

== Legacy ==
Magtymguly is part of a unique period in the cultural history of Central Asia; his exceptional talent projected his personal poetic synthesis onto the next generation of poets of the region.

Magtymguly is often placed alongside major figures of the Turkic literary world such as Hoja Ahmad Yasawi, Yunus Emre, Ali-Shir Nava&#x27;i and Fizuli.

27 June is celebrated in Turkmenistan as &quot;the Day of Workers of Culture and Arts and the poetry of Magtymguly Fragi&quot;.

The International Organization of Turkic Culture declared 2024 the &quot;Year of the Great Poet and Thinker of the Turkic World Magtymguly Pyragy&quot;, the anniversary of Magtymguly Pyragy is also included in the list of significant dates celebrated jointly with UNESCO in 2024-2025. In connection with the anniversary, a large-scale plan of festive events was approved in Turkmenistan and other countries, including Uzbekistan.

<text>&quot;Hound Dog&quot; is a twelve-bar blues song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Recorded originally by Big Mama Thornton on August 13, 1952, in Los Angeles and released by Peacock Records in late February 1953, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was Thornton&#x27;s only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&amp;B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;, ranked at 318 in the 2021 iteration of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013.

&quot;Hound Dog&quot; has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which ranked number 19 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004, but was excluded from the revised list in 2021 in favor of Thornton&#x27;s version; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Presley&#x27;s version, which sold about 10 million copies globally, was his best-selling song and &quot;an emblem of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll revolution&quot;. It was simultaneously number one on the US pop, country, and R&amp;B charts in 1956, and it topped the pop chart for 11 weeks—a record that stood for 36 years. Presley&#x27;s 1956 RCA recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1988, and it is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

&quot;Hound Dog&quot; has been at the center of controversies and several lawsuits, including disputes over authorship, royalties, and copyright infringement by the many answer songs released by such artists as Rufus Thomas and Roy Brown. From the 1970s onward, the song has been featured in numerous films.

==Background and composition==
On August 12, 1952, R&amp;B bandleader Johnny Otis asked 19-year-old songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to his home to meet blues singer Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton. Thornton had been signed by &quot;Diamond&quot; Don Robey&#x27;s Houston-based Peacock Records the year before, and after two failed singles, Robey had enlisted Otis to reverse her fortunes. After hearing Thornton rehearse several songs, Leiber and Stoller &quot;forged a tune to suit her personality—brusque and badass&quot;. In an interview in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in April 1990, Stoller said: &quot;She was a wonderful blues singer, with a great moaning style. But it was as much her appearance as her blues style that influenced the writing of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; and the idea that we wanted her to growl it.&quot; Leiber recalled: &quot;We saw Big Mama and she knocked me cold. She looked like the biggest, baddest, saltiest chick you would ever see. And she was mean, a &#x27;lady bear,&#x27; as they used to call &#x27;em. She must have been 350 pounds, and she had all these scars all over her face&quot; conveying words which could not be sung. &quot;But how to do it without actually saying it? And how to do it telling a story? I couldn&#x27;t just have a song full of expletives.&quot; In 1999, Leiber said, &quot;I was trying to get something like the Furry Lewis phrase &#x27;Dirty Mother Furya&#x27;. I was looking for something closer to that but I couldn&#x27;t find it, because everything I went for was too coarse and would not have been playable on the air.&quot; Using a &quot;black slang expression referring to a man who sought a woman to take care of him&quot;, the song&#x27;s opening line, &quot;You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a hound dog&quot;, was a euphemism, said Leiber The song, a Southern blues lament, is &quot;the tale of a woman throwing a gigolo out of her house and her life&quot;:

The song was written for a woman to sing in which she berates &quot;her selfish, exploitative man&quot;, and in it she &quot;expresses a woman&#x27;s rejection of a man – the metaphorical dog in the title&quot;. According to Iain Thomas, &quot;&#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; embodies the Thornton persona she had crafted as a comedienne prior to entering the music business&quot; by parading &quot;the classic puns, extended metaphors, and sexual double entendres so popular with the bawdy genre.&quot; R&amp;B expert George A. Moonoogian concurs, calling it &quot;a biting and scathing satire in the double-entendre genre&quot; of 1950s rhythm and blues.

Leiber and Stoller wrote the song &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in 12 to 15 minutes, with Leiber scribbling the lyrics in pencil on ordinary paper and without musical notation in the car on the way to Stoller&#x27;s apartment. Said Leiber, &quot;&#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; took like twelve minutes. That&#x27;s not a complicated piece of work. But the rhyme scheme was difficult. Also the metric structure of the music was not easy.&quot; According to Leiber, as soon as they reached the parking lot and Stoller&#x27;s 1937 Plymouth, &quot;I was beating out a rhythm we called the &#x27;buck dance&#x27; on the roof of the car. We got to Johnny Otis&#x27;s house and Mike went right to the piano… didn&#x27;t even bother to sit down. He had a cigarette in his mouth that was burning his left eye, and he started to play the song.&quot;

Leiber and Stoller along with Johnny Otis, also wrote a different version to the &quot;Hound Dog&quot; song structure on behalf of Big Mama Thornton, recorded with an alternative lyric entitled &quot;Tom Cat&quot;.

==Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s version (1952/53)==
Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; is credited with &quot;helping to spur the evolution of black R&amp;B into rock music&quot;. Brandeis University professor Stephen J. Whitfield, in his 2001 book &quot;In Search of American Jewish Culture&quot;, regards &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as a marker of &quot;the success of race-mixing in music a year before the desegregation of public schools was mandated&quot; in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Leiber regarded the original recording by the 350-pound &quot;blues belter&quot; Big Mama Thornton as his favorite version, while Stoller said, &quot;If I had to name my favorite recordings, I&#x27;d say they are Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; and Peggy Lee&#x27;s &#x27;Is That All There Is?&#x27;&quot;

In 1992, Leiber and Stoller recalled that during the rehearsal, Thornton sang the song as a ballad. Leiber said that this was not the way they planned and sang it for her, with Stoller on piano, as an example of the concept. Thornton agreed to try their recommendation.

According to Maureen Mahon, a music professor at New York University, Thornton&#x27;s version is &quot;an important [part of the] beginning of rock-and-roll, especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument&quot;.

===Recording===
Thornton recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; at Radio Recorders Annex in Los Angeles on August 13, 1952, the day after its composition. It subsequently became her biggest hit. According to &quot;Hound Dog: The Leiber and Stoller Autobiography&quot;, Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was the first record that Leiber and Stoller produced themselves, taking over from bandleader Johnny Otis. Said Stoller:
Otis played drums on the recording, replacing Ledard &quot;Kansas City&quot; Bell. As Otis was still signed exclusively to Federal Records, a subsidiary of Syd Nathan&#x27;s King Records as &quot;Kansas City Bill&quot; or perhaps with Mercury Records at this time, Otis used the pseudonym &quot;Kansas City Bill&quot; (after his drummer &quot;Kansas City&quot; Bell) on this record. Therefore, Otis, Louisiana blues guitarist Pete &quot;Guitar&quot; Lewis, and Puerto Rican bass player Mario Delagarde (some sources say erroneously it was Albert Winston) are listed as &quot;Kansas City Bill &amp; Orchestra&quot; on the Peacock record labels.

During the rehearsal, Leiber objected to Thornton&#x27;s vocal approach, as she was crooning the lyrics rather than belting them out. Although intimidated by her size and facial scarring, Leiber protested, to which Thornton responded with an icy glare and told him, White boy, don&#x27;t you be tellin&#x27; me how to sing the blues. After this exchange, Leiber sang the song himself to demonstrate how they wanted it done. After that, according to Stoller&#x27;s later recollection, Thornton understood the bawdy style they were looking for.

Speaking to music writer Ralph J. Gleason, Thornton recalled that she added a few interjections of her own, played around with the rhythm (some of the choruses have thirteen rather than twelve bars), and had the band bark and howl like hound dogs at the end of the song: &quot;I started to sing the words and join in some of my own. All that talkin&#x27; and hollerin&#x27;—that&#x27;s my own.&quot; Thornton interacts constantly in a call and response fashion during a one-minute long guitar &quot;solo&quot; by Lewis. These verbal interjections, sometimes called &quot;blues talk&quot;, are common in blues music. Years later Thornton helped launch a controversy over &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, claiming to have written it. When questioned further on the matter, Thornton explained that, while the song had been composed by Leiber and Stoller, she had transformed it: &quot;They gave me the words, but I changed it around and did it my way&quot;. In his book &quot;Race, Rock, and Elvis&quot;, Michael T. Bertrand says that Thornton&#x27;s explanation &quot;ingenuously stresses artist interpretation as the sole yardstick with which to measure authenticity&quot;.

Thornton recorded two takes of the song, and the second take was released. Habanera and mambo elements can be found in this recording. Puerto Rican bass player Mario Delagarde is credited with adding &quot;a jazz-based rhythm&quot;. Influenced by African-American musical cultures, its &quot;sounds range from the gravelly beginning of several phrases, to her spoken and howled interpolations, and the ending with dog sounds from the band.&quot; According to musicologist Robert Fink, Thornton&#x27;s delivery has flexible phrasing making use of micro-inflections and syncopations. Each has a focal accent which is never repeated. According to Maureen Mahon:
On September 9, 1952, the copyright application for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was lodged. On the application the words and music are attributed to Thornton and recording executive Don Robey, with the copyright claimants listed as: &quot;Murphy L. Robey (W) &amp; Willie Mae Thornton (A).&quot; It was renewed subsequently on May 13, 1980, with the same details.

===Release and reception===
In late February 1953, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was released by Peacock (Peacock 1612), with the song credited erroneously on the label to Leiber--Otis. Thornton recalled later that she learned her record was in circulation while she was on her way to a performance with the Johnny Otis Orchestra during this tour in Dayton, Ohio. &quot;I was going to the theater and I just turned the radio on in the car and the man said, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a record that&#x27;s going nationwide: &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; by Willie Mae Thornton.&#x27; I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s me!&#x27; [laughs] I hadn&#x27;t heard the record in so long. So when we get to the theater they was blasting it. You could hear it from the theater, from the loudspeaker. They were just playing &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; all over the theater. So I goes up in the operating room, I say, &#x27;Do you mind playing that again?&#x27; &#x27;Cause I hadn&#x27;t heard the record in so long I forgot the words myself. So I stood there while he was playing it, listening to it. So that evening I sang it on the show, and everybody went for it. &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; just took off like a jet.&quot;

On March 7, 1953, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was advertised in &quot;Billboard&quot;, and reviewed positively on March 14, 1953, as a new record to watch, described as &quot;a wild and exciting rhumba blues&quot; with &quot;infectious backing that rocks all the way&quot;. According to Johnny Ace biographer James M. Salem, &quot;The rawness of the sound combined with the overt sexuality of the lyric made &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; an immediate smash hit in urban black America from late March to the middle of July 1953.&quot; &quot;Hound Dog&quot; takes off immediately and looks like a national hit record. Rufus Thomas quickly records an answer song called &quot;Bear Cat&quot; on Sun 181. Thornton&#x27;s record is such a big seller that Peacock Records has three new pressing plants running full-time to try and keep up with demand. Debuting in the charts on March 28, 1953, it spent fourteen weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythm and Blues charts, seven of them at number one. By April 30, 1953, &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine listed the song as &quot;the nation&#x27;s top-selling blues record&quot;, and it topped the charts in New York, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco, Newark, Memphis, Dallas, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Los Angeles. &quot;By mid summer, it is obvious that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; will be the biggest seller in the history of Peacock Records.&quot; The song was named as the Best Rhythm and Blues song of 1953 by &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine, and was ranked number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Best Selling Rhythm &amp; Blues Chart for 1953.

Don Robey estimated that Thornton&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; sold between 500,000 and 750,000 copies, and would have sold more had its sales not been diluted by an abundance of cover versions and &quot;answer songs&quot;. The success of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; secured Peacock Record&#x27;s place as a major independent label. However, despite its success, neither the composers nor artist were compensated well for their efforts. According to Stoller, &quot;Big Mama&#x27;s &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; went to number one, sold a million copies, and did nothing for our bank statements. We were getting screwed.&quot; After suing Robey, &quot;We were given an advance check for $1,200,&quot; said Stoller, &quot;but the check bounced.&quot; As a result, Leiber and Stoller started their own label, Spark Records, and publishing company, Quintet Music. Those ventures were successful, but Leiber and Stoller would only earn substantial royalties from &quot;Hound Dog&quot; when it was covered by Elvis Presley (RCA 6604) in July 1956. Similarly, Thornton stated: &quot;That song sold over two million records. I got one check for $500 and never saw another.&quot; In 1984, she told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t get no money from them at all. Everybody livin&#x27; in a house but me. I&#x27;m just livin.&quot;

===Re-releases===
By July 1956, &quot;the rock &#x27;n roll age was upon the world, and as the new sensation Elvis Presley recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to international acclaim, Peacock re-released Thornton&#x27;s original&quot; by August 18, 1956, backing it with &quot;Rock-a-Bye Baby&quot; (Peacock 5–1612), but it failed to chart. In Australia and New Zealand, Prestige Records (founded in Auckland by 17 year-old Phil Warren and Bruce Henderson) released the same record on licence in 1956 (Prestige PSP-1004), but the composition is credited to Robey-Thornton-Leiber-Stoller. By early 1957 &quot;Willie Mae Thornton is seen as one who is out of the rock / pop mainstream and so her affiliation with Peacock Records ends... Thornton continues to make personal appearances and is always remembered for her original version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; which gets a spate of airplay during the summer of 1958 which leads to another re-release of the original.&quot; On October 7, 1965, Thornton&#x27;s live performance of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; with Eddie Boyd and Buddy Guy at American Folk Blues Festival &#x27;65 in Hamburg, Germany, was recorded and released subsequently by Fontana Records on an album &quot;American Folk Blues Festival &#x27;65&quot; (Fontana 681 529 TL) with other artists.

===Awards and accolades===
In February 2013, Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame. It has also received the following accolades:
* #36 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Fifty Essential Recordings from the Fifties&quot; (1990)
* Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;
* In 2017, Thornton&#x27;s recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.
* The original version was ranked No. 318 on the 2021 edition of &quot;Top 500 Songs of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine.

===Responses (1953–1955)===
====Cover versions====
Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was so popular that it spawned at least ten cover versions of the original before Elvis Presley recorded it in July 1956. One of the earliest covers of Thornton&#x27;s original was that of Little Esther, who recorded an R&amp;B cover on March 11, 1953 (b/w &quot;Sweet Lips&quot;) on Federal Records (Federal 12126) that was released by April. While Federal&#x27;s trade ads touted this release as the greatest record ever made by Little Esther, in its review on April 11, 1953, &quot;Billboard&quot; opined: &quot;It fails to build the same excitement of the original.&quot;

Within a month of the release of Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, the following six country cover versions of the song—all credited erroneously to Leiber-Stoller (or )-Otis—were released on several different labels by white artists:
* Jack Turner &amp; his Granger County Gang (RCA 20–5267; 47–5267) (actually Henry D. Haynes on vocals, with his Homer and Jethro partner Kenneth C. Burns on mandolin, with Chet Atkins on lead guitar, Charles Green on bass, and Jerry Byrd on steel guitar), recorded a rockabilly boogie or hillbilly country-western version on March 20, 1953, in New York City. After the success of Patti Page&#x27;s version of the Bob Merrill-penned &quot;(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?&quot;, as Homer and Jethro they recorded a parody version, &quot;(How Much Is) That Hound Dog in the Window&quot; (RCA Victor 47–5280) in March that went to number two on the US Country charts, and number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; national charts. &quot;Billboard&quot; noted: &quot;By coincidence or intent, the use of &#x27;hound dog&#x27; also recognizes the top r&amp;b record of the moment.&quot; After Elvis Presley released his version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in 1956, by early November Homer &amp; Jethro released a parody version, &quot;Houn&#x27; Dawg&quot; (RCA Victor 6706).
* Billy Starr (Imperial 8186) This version is described as &quot;a juke joint-honed blend of country and pre-rockabilly raunch&quot;.
* Eddie Hazelwood (Intro 6069) His version &quot;two-steps in honky-tonk style.&quot;
* Former Hollywood child actress and 1946 National Yodeling champion Betsy Gay (Intro 6070) recorded a hillbilly version with Joe Maphis and Merle Travis at Radio Recorders studio in Los Angeles on March 18, 1953. &quot;Billboard&quot; described her recording: &quot;She sings it well, shouting out the lyrics with occasional excitement, tho without the power the tune needs.&quot;
* Former Texas Playboy band Western swing vocalist Tommy Duncan and the Miller Bros. (Intro 6071) Duncan&#x27;s version is described as &quot;a smoother, jazzy reading featuring fine guitar and piano contributions&quot;.
*Cleve Jackson (Jackson Cleveland Toombs) &amp; His Hound Dogs (Herald 6000),

On February 24, 1954, The Cozy Cole All Stars recorded an instrumental version, &quot;Hound Dog Special&quot; (MGM 11794), a &quot; of Willie Mae Thornton&#x27;s&quot; version.

Bass player Al Rex, who joined Bill Haley and His Comets in the fall of 1955, told of performing the song when given the spotlight at live performances. &quot;I used to do &#x27;Hound Dog.&#x27; Haley would get mad at me if I&#x27;d do that. This was even before Presley did it. Haley didn&#x27;t like those guys from Philadelphia that wrote the song.&quot; As Leiber and Stoller were not from Philadelphia (and Haley recorded other Leiber and Stoller songs), Haley was probably referring to Freddie Bell and Bernie Lowe, of Philadelphia&#x27;s Teen Records.

In later years Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s version was covered by such artists as the Dirty Blues Band on their 1968 album &quot;Dirty Blues Band&quot;; Etta James; Robert Palmer; and Macy Gray.

====Answers and parodies====
By the end of 1953, at least six &quot;answer songs&quot; that responded to &#x27;Big Mama&#x27; Thornton&#x27;s original version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; were released. According to Peacock&#x27;s Don Robey, these songs were &quot;bastardizations&quot; of the original and reduced its sales potential.

=====&quot;Bear Cat&quot; (1953)=====
The first and most popular answer song to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was &quot;Bear Cat (The Answer To Hound Dog)&quot; (Sun 101), recorded at Sun Studios at 706 Union Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee on March 8, 1953, just two weeks after Thornton&#x27;s original version was released, and even before a review of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; had been published in &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;Bear Cat&quot; had new lyrics written by Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, in which he altered the gender of the singer, who bemoaned that his woman was a &quot;bear cat&quot;, a Jazz Age slang term for &quot;a hot-blooded or fiery girl&quot;. According to Phillips&#x27; biographer Peter Guralnick: 
:Sam was knocked out by Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; the first time he heard it. Performed with ripsaw gusto by the singer... and modified by a delicate Latin-flavored &quot;rhumba-boogie&quot; beat, the record struck a communal chord somewhere between low comedy and bedrock truth. It totally tickled Sam on both levels. &quot;I said, my God, it&#x27;s so true. You ain&#x27;t nothing but a hound dog. You ain&#x27;t met your responsibilities. You didn&#x27;t go to work like you [should].&quot; And it gave him an immediate idea for a follow-up – from the &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; point of view... &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, &quot;[i]n the time-honored tradition of answer songs, was a virtual carbon copy of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; with lyrics, chord progressions, and rhythmic structure all patterned directly on the original.

Looking for a suitable man to record this song, Phillips selected part-time local WDIA disk jockey Rufus Thomas, who adopted the nickname, &quot;Rufus &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; Thomas&quot; for this recording. &quot;With his gruff Louis Armstrong-influenced voice, quick wit, and eye-popping antics, he was the perfect candidate to reply to the harsh accusations Big Mama Thornton had thrown out in her song, this time leveling them at a &#x27;bossy woman&#x27;&quot;. Despite his reluctance to record the song and his reservations about the band assembled by Phillips, Thomas &quot;threw himself into the song with the same brash charm that he brought to all his performances, complete with yowls, growls, and fervent imprecations&quot;. The record&#x27;s spare electric guitar work by Memphis bluesman Joe Hill Louis was greatly influenced by that of Pete Lewis on the original. According to James M. Salem:
While &quot;the result was peppier than Big Mama&#x27;s version, with a more straight-ahead beat... [Phillips] was under no illusions about surpassing the original&quot;: &quot;Hell, we didn&#x27;t come close to being as good as Big Mama. She could have done that song a cappella and convinced me that, by God, you ain&#x27;t nothing but a damned hound dog!&quot; Thomas was dissatisfied with the result, especially Joe Hill Louis&#x27;s country-style blues guitar playing. In 1978, Robert Palmer wrote: &quot;Even today, Rufus takes perverse delight in pointing out the wrong notes in Louis&#x27;s solo.&quot;

Within two weeks, &quot;Bear Cat&quot; (Sun 181) was in stores, prompting &quot;Billboard&quot; to describe it on March 28 as &quot;the fastest answer song to hit the market&quot;. It became both Thomas&#x27; and Sun Records&#x27; first hit, More than 5,000 copies were ordered in the first days by distributors, and by mid-April it had charted nationally, eventually reaching number three on the R&amp;B charts. However, as Phillips claimed a writing credit for the song, a copyright-infringement suit ensued that nearly bankrupted Phillips&#x27; record label.

=====Other answer records=====
In the months after the release of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, a spate of answer records followed:
* On March 18, Blues shouter Roy Brown recorded &quot;Mr. Hound Dog&#x27;s in Town&quot; for King Records (45–4627). While it had the same melody and many of the same lyrics as the original, Brown is credited as the sole writer. Despite the threat of legal action, Brown&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Hound Dog&#x27;s in Town&quot; was still being advertised in &quot;Billboard&quot; on June 6, 1953.
* Vocalist Charlie Gore and guitarist Louis Innis recorded &quot;(You Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a Female) Hound Dog&quot; (King 45–1212) for King Records on March 22. This song was credited to Innis, Lois Mann (a pseudonym of King Records owner Syd Nathan, the latter his wife&#x27;s maiden name), and Johnny Otis.
* At the request of Leonard Chess, Blues guitarist John Brim wrote an answer song called &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; for Chess Records&#x27; Checker subsidiary. In March 1953, Brim and His Gary Kings recorded &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; (Checker 769) at Universal Recording in Chicago. &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; and &quot;It Was a Dream&quot; were backed by Little Walter on blues harp; Willie Dixon on string bass; Fred Below on drums; and Louis and Dave Myers on guitar. However, when Don Robey threatened an injunction against Sun Records for the similar &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, Leonard and Phil Chess, decided to not to release &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; at that time. In 1969 these songs were released officially on &quot;Whose Muddy Shoes&quot; (1969: Chess LP 1537) with songs by both Brim and Elmore James, and the backing musicians credited as &quot;his Stompers&quot;. 
* Jake Porter&#x27;s Combo Records released &quot;Real Gone Hound Dog&quot; (Combo 25), &quot;an obscure &#x27;answer&#x27; record to &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;&quot;, by Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones&#x27; with a vocal by Higgins&#x27; brother &quot;Daddy Cleanhead&quot;. The composition was credited to Higgins and Porter (as V. Haven).
* &quot;Call Me a Hound Dog&quot;, written by Bob Geddins, in which the hound dog states his case, was recorded by Blues singer Jimmy Wilson (as Jimmie Wilson) and His All Stars (with Hal &quot;King&quot; Solomon on piano) and released by Geddins&#x27; Big Town Records in May 1953 (Big Town Records 103). The review in the May 23 edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; describes this song as &quot;the latest, and possibly the last in the long line of answers to &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;, featuring Jimmy Wilson singing the tune okay style. Ork backs him in a blues manner but they could have added a stronger beat.&quot; 
* Former &quot;Our Gang&quot; child actor Eugene Jackson and actress Juanita Moore (backed by the Eugene Jackson Trio and All Stars) also recorded &quot;You Call Me a Hound Dog&quot; about this time which was released on John Dolphin&#x27;s Recorded In Hollywood label (421A). 
* &quot;New Hound Dog&quot; (Big Town 116) by Frank &quot;Dual Trumpeter&quot; Motley and His Motley Crew, with vocals provided by Curley Bridges was recorded in October 1954 for Big Town Records, a subsidiary of 4 Star Records, owned by Bob Geddins. Motley is credited as the sole composer, and &quot;King&quot; Herbert Whitaker plays tenor saxophone. This song is described as &quot;the first rocking rearrangement of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;&quot;. It was re-released in Canada in 1956 by Quality Records (Quality K1544).

When the dust settled, the publishing for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (in all variations) remained with Lion, and writing credit with Leiber and Stoller. In April, 1954, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Rolontz summed up the events thusly: &quot;The year 1953 saw an important precedent set in regard to answer tunes… since the &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; decision, few record firms have attempted to &#x27;answer&#x27; smash hits by other companies by using same tune with different lyrics.&quot;

====&quot;Rip offs&quot;====
Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton&#x27;s release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Play Girl&quot;, credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45–5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a &quot;stomping uptempo boogie rocker&quot;, it began: &quot;You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long&quot;. In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse &quot;Big &#x27;Tiny&#x27;&quot; Kennedy recorded &quot;Country Boy&quot; accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA&#x27;s Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to &quot;Hound Dog&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Country Boy&#x27; has a deceptively slouching flip on the &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; motif – this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he &#x27;ain&#x27;t nothing but a country boy&#x27;&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as &quot;Hound Dog&quot; called &quot;(You Ain&#x27;t Nuttin&#x27; But a) Juicehead&quot; on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips&#x27; brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored.
Philip H. Ennis sees &quot;Two Hound Dogs&quot;, which was recorded on May 10, 1955, by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets (Decca 29552), as a response to Thornton&#x27;s recording. While not an answer record in the traditional sense, the lyric characterized &quot;Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Blues&quot; as the titular &quot;Two Hound Dogs&quot;, an apparent testament to the stature of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;.

==Freddie Bell and the Bellboys&#x27; versions (1955–1956)==

By 1955 Philadelphia-based Teen Records co-founder Bernie Lowe suspected that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; could potentially have greater appeal, but knew it had to be sanitized for mainstream acceptance, and so asked popular Las Vegas lounge act Freddie Bell of Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, who had been performing songs with &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; humour as the band in residence at The Silver Queen Bar and Cocktail Lounge at The Sands Hotel and Casino soon after its opening in December 1952, to rewrite the lyrics for their first release on his label.

Bell removed innuendoes like &quot;You can wag your tail but I ain&#x27;t gonna feed you no more&quot; and replaced them with sanitized lyrics, changing a racy song about a disappointing lover into a song that was literally about a dog. Musically, he gave the song a rock and roll rhythm. Jerry Leiber, the original lyricist, found these changes irritating, saying that the rewritten words made &quot;no sense&quot;. Described as &quot;one of their trademark spoofs&quot;, the Bellboys version became a staple of their Las Vegas act.

In early 1955 this version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; became the first record released on Teen Records (TEEN 101), &quot;a subsidiary of the equally obscure Sound Records&quot;, that was owned by Lowe; jazz impresario Nat Segal, who owned Downbeat, the first integrated nightclub in Philadelphia; and partially by &quot;American Bandstand&quot;&#x27;s creator and first host Bob Horn. Their version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, which includes &quot;arf arf&quot; dog sounds made by the band throughout the song, also included the &quot;most overused rhythmic pattern&quot; of the 1950s, the three-beat Latin bass riff pioneered by Dave Bartholomew that was also used in Rufus Thomas&#x27; &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, a 1953 answer song to Thornton&#x27;s original recording, and subsequently in Presley&#x27;s 1956 recording. In June 1984 music researcher and historian George A. Moonoogian also &quot;found a stylistic similarity&quot; between Frank &quot;Dual Trumpeter&quot; Motley &amp; His Crew&#x27;s 1954 number &quot;New Hound Dog&quot; (Big Town 116) and Bell&#x27;s 1955 Teen Records release of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. On the single&#x27;s label, authorship is credited to and Stoller. No credit is given to Bell or anyone else for the revised lyrics. Their recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was a local hit in the Philadelphia area, and received &quot;lots of radio play on the east coast, and Bell found himself with a regional hit, that included Philadelphia, Cleveland, and New York. Despite &quot;Hound Dog&quot; spending 16 weeks at number one on the pre-Dick Clark &quot;Bandstand&quot;, it attracted no national attention. However, the regional popularity of this release, along with the group&#x27;s showmanship, yielded a tour; an appearance in the seminal pioneer Rock and Roll musical film &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in January 1956; and eventually a recording contract with Mercury Records&#x27; Wing Records subsidiary by February 1956.

In May 1956 (two months before Presley recorded his version), Bell and the Bell Boys recorded a more up &quot;tempo&quot; version of the song for Mercury that was over 20 seconds shorter, and that also omitted the comedic &quot;arf arf&quot; dog sounds of their 1955 Teen Records version. However, Mercury did not release this new version until after the success of Presley&#x27;s version. Initially released in France in late 1956 on an EP &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (Barclay 14159), it was released subsequently in 1957 in Australia (July 1957: Mercury Records 45152), Sweden (&quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Vol. 2&quot;; Mercury EP-1-3502), and Norway (Mercury EP MN5). As the legal dispute about its composition had not been resolved, authorship of the Mercury Records version is attributed to Leiber-Stoller-Otis. Mercury finally released Freddie Bell and the Bellboys&#x27; new version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in the USA on their debut album &quot;Rock &amp; Roll ... All Flavors&quot; (Mercury MG 20289) in January 1958, but now crediting Leiber &amp; Stoller only. Both the 1955 Teen Records (2:45) and the 1956 Mercury Records (2:22) versions of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; are included in the 1996 compilation album &quot;Rockin&#x27; Is Our Business &quot;(Germany: Bear Family Records BCD 15901).

==Elvis Presley&#x27;s version (1956)==
Elvis Presley and his band first encountered &quot;Hound Dog&quot; at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1956. Presley had been booked from April 23 through May 6, 1956 to appear at the Venus Room of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino as an &quot;extra added attraction&quot;, third on the bill to the Freddy Martin Orchestra and comedian Shecky Greene.

It was his first appearance in Las Vegas. However, &quot;because of audience dissatisfaction, low attendance, and unsavory behavior by underage fans&quot;, the booking was reduced to one week. Freddie Bell and the Bellboys were still the resident act at the Silver Queen Bar in the Sands, and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; remained a staple for them. Presley and his band attended a performance and loved their burlesque reworking of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. According to Paul W. Papa: &quot;From the first time Elvis heard this song he was hooked. He went back over and over again until he learned the chords and lyrics.&quot; When asked about &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, Presley&#x27;s guitarist Scotty Moore and his drummer D. J. Fontana agreed that Presley had borrowed the Bellboys version after seeing them perform the song live.

In 1992, Leiber and Stoller confirmed that Presley was familiar with Thornton&#x27;s record of the song but &quot;he didn&#x27;t do her version&quot;; he had learned the song from Freddie Bell &amp; The Bellboys. Presley first added &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to his live performances at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. Ace Collins indicates that &quot;Far from being the frenetic, hard-driving song that he would eventually record, Elvis&#x27; early live renditions of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; usually moved pretty slowly, with an almost burlesque feel.&quot; Presley modelled his performance, particularly his hip gyrations, on the Bellboys version, which was a Las Vegas-style comic burlesque.

Just weeks after they had seen Bell and the Bellboys perform, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; became Elvis and Scotty and Bill&#x27;s closing number for the first time on May 15, 1956, at Ellis Auditorium in Memphis, during the Memphis Cotton Festival before an audience of 7,000. The song remained his standard closer until the late 1960s. By the spring of 1956, Presley was fast becoming a national phenomenon and teenagers came to his concerts in unprecedented numbers, with the enthusiastic reaction – particularly to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; – causing riots at some performances. Presley researcher Guillermo F. Perez-Argüello contends that:

=== Response ===
Larry Birnbaum described Elvis Presley&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as &quot;an emblem of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll revolution&quot;. George Plasketes argues that Elvis Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; should not be considered a cover &quot;since [most listeners] … were innocent of Willie Mae Thornton&#x27;s original 1953 release&quot;. Michael Coyle asserts that &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, like almost all of Presley&#x27;s &quot;covers were all of material whose brief moment in the limelight was over, without the songs having become standards.&quot; While, because of its popularity, Presley&#x27;s recording &quot;arguably usurped the original&quot;, Plasketes concludes: &quot;anyone who&#x27;s ever heard the Big Mama Thornton original would probably argue otherwise.&quot; Presley was aware of and appreciated Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s original recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, and had a copy in his personal record collection. Ron Smith, a schoolfriend of Presley&#x27;s, says he remembers Presley singing along to a version by Tommy Duncan (lead singer for the classic lineup of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys). According to another schoolmate, Presley&#x27;s favorite r&#x27;n&#x27;b song was &quot;Bear Cat (the Answer to Hound Dog)&quot; by Rufus Thomas, a hero of Presley&#x27;s.

Agreeing with Robert Fink, who claims that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as performed by Presley was intended as a burlesque, &quot;troping off white overreactions to a black sexual innuendo&quot;, Freya Jarman-Ivens asserts that &quot;Presley&#x27;s version of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; started its life as a blackface comedy&quot;, in the manner of Al Jolson, but more especially &quot;African-American performers with a penchant for &#x27;clowning&#x27;Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Louis Jordan. It was Freddie Bell and the Bellboys&#x27; performance of the song (with Bell&#x27;s amended lyrics) that influenced Presley&#x27;s decision to perform, and later record and release, his own version: &quot;Elvis&#x27;s version of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; (1956) came about, not as an attempt to cover Thornton&#x27;s record, but as an imitation of a &quot;parody&quot; of her record performed by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys… The words, the tempo, and the arrangement of Elvis&#x27; &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; come not from Thornton&#x27;s version of the song, but from the Bellboys&#x27;.&quot; According to Rick Coleman, the Bellboys&#x27; version &quot;featured [Dave] Bartholomew&#x27;s three-beat Latin riff, which had been heard in Bill Haley&#x27;s &#x27;Shake, Rattle and Roll&#x27;.&quot; Just as Haley had borrowed the riff from Bartholomew, Presley borrowed it from Bell and the Bellboys. The Latin riff form that was used in Presley&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was known as &quot;Habanera rhythm&quot;, which is a Spanish and African-American musical beat form. After the release of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; by Presley, the Habanera rhythm gained much popularity in American popular music.

When asked if Bell had any objections to Presley recording his own version, Bell gave Colonel Tom Parker, Presley&#x27;s manager, a copy of his 1955 Teen Records&#x27; recording, hoping that if Presley recorded it, &quot;he might reap some benefit when his own version was released on an album&quot;. According to Bell, &quot;[Parker] promised me that if I gave him the song, the next time Elvis went on tour, I would be the opening act for him—which never happened.&quot; In another interview Bell said: &quot;I hope my career is more than giving &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; to Elvis&quot;. In May 1956, two months before Presley&#x27;s release, Bell re-recorded a more frantic version of the song for the Mercury label; however, it was not released as a single until 1957. It was later included on Bell&#x27;s 1957 album, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll…All Flavors&quot; (Mercury Records MG 20289).

===Television performances===
Presley first performed &quot;Hound Dog&quot; for a nationwide television audience on &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; on June 5, 1956. It was his second appearance on Berle&#x27;s program. At Berle&#x27;s request, Presley appeared without his guitar, the first time he had done so on national television. By this time, Presley&#x27;s band had added instrumental flourishes to the song: Scotty Moore had added a guitar solo, and D.J. Fontana had added a drum roll between verses. The performance started in an upbeat tempo in the style of the Bellboys, but dropped to a half tempo for the dramatic finish. Presley&#x27;s movements during the performance were energetic and sexually charged, especially his hip gyrations, and the reactions of young women in the studio audience were enthusiastic, as shown on the broadcast. According to Robert Fink, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as performed by Presley on Berle&#x27;s show was intended to be humorous, &quot;troping off white overreactions to a black sexual innuendo&quot;. Over 40,000,000 people saw the performance.

Unfortunately for Presley, the mainstream public did not find the sexually charged performance amusing, and controversy erupted. It was the first major controversy of Presley&#x27;s career. Letters of protest poured into the NBC mailroom, critics called the performance vulgar, moral watchdogs raised concerns about juvenile delinquency, and even the Catholic Church published an opinion piece entitled &quot;Beware Elvis Presley&quot;. The performance earned Presley the sobriquet &quot;Elvis the Pelvis&quot;. Ed Sullivan, host of a popular televised variety show, publicly stated that he would never feature Presley. Steve Allen, who had already booked Presley for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; on NBC, faced pressure from network executives to cancel the performance. Allen refused, insisting he would control the performance so it would not offend the public&#x27;s sensibilities.

Presley appeared on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; on July 1 that year. Steve Allen, who was notoriously contemptuous of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music and especially songs such as &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, ensured that the performance had a comedic bent, cracking jokes and presenting Presley with a signed prop toilet paper roll as a play on the name of the genre. Presley performed in a tuxedo while singing an abbreviated version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to an actual top hat-wearing Basset Hound. Presley was reportedly a good sport about the silliness while on the show, but Presley would later recall it as an extremely embarrassing moment. Scotty Moore later suggested that Presley&#x27;s anger about the way Allen orchestrated the performance drove the aggressive style that he recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in the very next day.

Although Ed Sullivan had publicly stated he would never invite Presley onto his show, the ratings success of Presley&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; convinced him to reconsider. Sullivan wound up paying $50,000 for Presley to appear on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; three times; &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was performed during each appearance. On September 9, 1956, with the song topping several U.S. charts, Presley&#x27;s set featured an abbreviated version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. During his second appearance on October 28, Presley jokingly introduced the song as &quot;one of the saddest songs we&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, before playing it in full. In the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed seven songs, including &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. This proved to be Presley&#x27;s last live performance on American television.

===Recording===
For 7 hours from 2:00 pm on July 2, 1956, the day after the &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot; performance, Presley recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; along with &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Any Way You Want Me&quot; for RCA Victor at RCA&#x27;s New York City studio with his regular band of Scotty Moore on lead guitar, Bill Black on bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, and backing vocals from the Jordanaires. Despite its popularity in his live shows, Presley had neither planned nor prepared to record &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, but agreed to do so at the insistence of RCA&#x27;s assigned producer Stephen H. Sholes, who argued that &quot;&#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; was so identified with Elvis that fans would demand a record of the concert standard.&quot; According to Ace Collins: &quot;Elvis may not have wanted to record &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;, but he had a definite idea of how he wanted the finished product to sound. Though he usually slowed it down and treated it like a blues number in concert, in the studio Elvis wanted the song to come off as fast and dynamic.&quot; While the producing credit was given to Sholes, the studio recordings reveal that Presley produced the songs himself, which is verified by the band members. Gordon Stoker, First Tenor of the Jordanaires, who were chosen to provide backup vocals, recalls: &quot;They had demos on almost everything that Elvis recorded, and we&#x27;d take it from the demo. We&#x27;d listen to the demo, most of the time, and we&#x27;d take it from the demo. We had (Big) Mama Thornton&#x27;s record on &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;, since she had a record on that. After listening to it we actually thought it was awful and couldn&#x27;t figure out why Elvis wanted to do that.&quot; However, what Stoker did not realize was that Presley wanted to record the version he saw in Las Vegas by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys that he had been performing since May. As session pianist Emidio &quot;Shorty Long&quot; Vagnoni left to work on a rehearsal for a stage show, Stoker plays piano on this recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. As Stoker was unable to also sing first tenor, &quot;the Jordanaires try to come up with a combined sound as best they can to cover it, and Gordon laughs as he states, &#x27;That&#x27;s one of the worst sounds we ever got on any record!&#x27; However Elvis insists on doing the song, and the results, albeit without Gordon singing tenor, will still do more than please the masses. Gordon also related that Elvis very much knew in his mind what he wanted the final results to be so they didn&#x27;t spend a lot of time working out tempos.&quot;
In response to journalist Dave Schwensen, who said: &quot;I remember reading an interview a few years ago with Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones... &quot;He was talking about the second guitar break on the recording of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; and said it sounded like you just took off your guitar, dropped it on the floor and it got the perfect sound. He said he&#x27;s never been able to figure out how you did that.&quot;, in 2002 Scotty Moore indicated: &quot;
Musicologist Robert Fink asserts that &quot;Elvis drove the band through thirty-one takes, slowly fashioning a menacing, rough-trade version quite different than the one they had been performing on the stage.&quot; The result of Presley&#x27;s efforts was an &quot;angry hopped-up version&quot; of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Citing Presley&#x27;s anger at his treatment on the &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot; the previous evening, Peter Nazareth sees this recording as &quot;revenge on Steve (&quot;you ain&#x27;t no friend of mine&quot;) Allen, and as a protest at being censored on national TV.&quot; In analyzing Presley&#x27;s recording, Fink asserts that 
In the end, Presley chose version 28, declaring: &quot;This is the one.&quot; During the day Presley&#x27;s manager Colonel Tom Parker told RCA vice president Larry Kananga that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; &quot;may become such a big hit that RCA may have to change its corporate symbol from the &#x27;Victor Dog&#x27; to the &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;.&quot; Although Presley knew about Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; the lyrics to his recording of the song were actually based on the Freddie and Bellboys 1955 version, which involved the lyrics being rewritten to make the song&#x27;s subject a dog rather than a man.

After this recording, Presley performed this &quot;angry hopped-up version&quot; of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in his concerts, and also on his performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on September 9 and October 28, 1956.

===Release and reception===
&quot;Hound Dog&quot; (G2WW-5935) was initially released as the B-side to the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; (G2WW-5936) on July 13, 1956. Soon after the single was re-released with &quot;Hound Dog&quot; first and in larger print than &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; on the record sleeve. Both sides of the record topped &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Best Sellers in Stores and Most Played in Jukeboxes charts alongside &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, while &quot;Hound Dog&quot; on its own merit topped the country &amp; western and rhythm &amp; blues charts and peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; main pop chart, the Top 100. Later reissues of the single by RCA in the 1960s designated the pair as double-A-sided. By August 18, 1956, Peacock Records had re-released Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s original recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, backing it with &quot;Rock-a-Bye Baby&quot; (Peacock 5–1612), but it failed to chart.

Stoller learned of the Presley cover from Leiber after returning from vacation in Europe. He expressed some disappointment in the success of the cover: &quot;It just sounded terribly nervous, too fast, too white. But you know, after it sold seven or eight million records it started to sound better.&quot; Leiber and Stoller tired of explaining that Presley had dropped most of their lyrics. For example, Leiber complained about Presley adding the line, &quot;You ain&#x27;t never caught a rabbit, and you ain&#x27;t no friend of mine&quot;, calling it &quot;inane… It doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me.&quot; Forty years later, Leiber told music journalist Rikky Rooksby that Presley had stamped the hit with his own identity: &quot;(A) white singer from Memphis who&#x27;s a hell of a singer—he does have some black attitudes—takes the song over… But here&#x27;s the thing: we didn&#x27;t make it. His version is like a combination of country and skiffle. It&#x27;s not black. He sounds like Hank Snow. In most cases where we are attributed with rock and roll, it&#x27;s misleading, because what we did is usually the original record—which is R&amp;B—and some other producer (and a lot of them are great) covered our original record.&quot;

In September 1956, Democratic congressman Emanuel Celler expressed disgusted at &quot;the bad taste that is exemplified by Elvis Presley&#x27;s &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; music, with his animal gyrations&quot;. In October 1956 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; critic Steve Race reacted negatively to Presley&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, saying that &quot;for sheer repulsiveness coupled with the monotony of incoherence, &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; hit a new low in my experience.&quot; Race later stated: &quot;it is a thoroughly bad record&quot;, lacking in &quot;tone, intelligibility, musicianship, taste [and] subtlety&quot;, and defying &quot;the decent limits of guitar amplification&quot;.

In 1957 Frank Sinatra supported US Senator George Smathers&#x27; crusade against &quot;inferior music&quot;, including &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, which Sinatra sarcastically referred to as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;. Oscar Hammerstein II had &quot;a particular loathing of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;&quot;. In 1960, Perry Como told &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;: &quot;When I hear &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; I have to vomit a little, but in 1975 it will probably be a slightly ancient classic.&quot; Albin J. Zak III, Professor of Music at the State University of New York, Albany, in his inaugural American Musicological Society/Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame lecture, &quot;&#x27;A Thoroughly Bad Record&#x27;: Elvis Presley&#x27;s &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; as Rock and Roll Manifesto&quot;, in October 2011 asserted: &quot;In retrospect… we can recognize defining moments of crystallization… The record was widely scorned by music industry veterans and high-pop aficionados, yet in its rude enthusiasm it represents an emphatic assertion of aesthetic principle at the dawn of rock and roll.&quot; In 1997 Bob Dylan indicated that Presley&#x27;s record influenced his decision to get into music: &quot;What got me into the whole thing in the beginning wasn&#x27;t songwriting. When &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; came across the radio, there was nothing in my mind that said, &#x27;Wow, what a great song, I wonder who wrote that?&#x27;… It was just… it was just there.&quot;

Presley&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; sold over 4 million copies in the United States on its first release. It was his best-selling single and, starting in July 1956, it spent eleven weeks at number one—a record not eclipsed until Boyz II Men&#x27;s &quot;End of the Road&quot; held at the top for 13 weeks in 1992. It stayed in the number one spot until it was replaced by &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, also recorded by Presley. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the number two song for 1956. &quot;Hound Dog&quot; would go on to sell 10 million copies worldwide, including 5 million in the United States alone. In 1958 the &quot;Hound Dog&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; single became just the third record to sell more than three million copies, following Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; and Gene Autry&#x27;s &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

Despite its commercial success, &quot;Elvis used to say that &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; was the silliest song he&#x27;d ever sung and thought it might sell ten or twelve records right around his folks&#x27; neighborhood.&quot; By the end of summer 1956, after Presley&#x27;s recording of the song was a million-seller, Freddie Bell, who had introduced his version of the song to Presley in April, told an interviewer: &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel bad about that at all. In fact, I encouraged him to record it.&quot; However, after the success of Presley&#x27;s recording, &quot;Bell sued to get some of the composer royalties because he had changed the words and indeed the song, and he would have made millions as the songwriter of Elvis&#x27;s version: but he lost because he did not ask Leiber &amp; Stoller for permission to make the changes and thereby add his name as songwriter.&quot;

Following Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; Lieber and Stoller would write numerous songs for Presley.

====Later notable performances====
Presley&#x27;s final performance on stage for almost 8 years was a benefit concert for the USS Arizona Memorial on Sunday, March 25, 1961, at the Bloch Arena in Pearl Harbor. During this concert, which raised nearly $65,000 for the USS Arizona Memorial building fund, Presley closed the concert singing &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Presley performed a high-energy version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in his legendary &quot;Comeback Special&quot; that aired on December 3, 1968, on the NBC television network. After the ratings success of this program, on July 31, 1969, Presley returned to perform in Las Vegas for the first time since his unsuccessful performances in April and May 1956. Booked for a four-week, fifty-seven show engagement at the International Hotel, which has just been built and has the largest showroom in the city, &quot;this engagement breaks all existing Las Vegas attendance records and attracts rave reviews from the public and the critics. It is a triumph.&quot; Presley&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Elvis in Person at the International Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada&quot; was recorded during this engagement and was soon released. During this concert, Presley introduced &quot;Hound Dog&quot; as his &quot;special song&quot;. &quot;Never one to take himself too seriously, Elvis joked with the crowd about the old days and the old songs. At one point, he decided to dedicate his next number to the audience and the staff at the International: &#x27;This is the only song I could think of that really expresses my feeling toward the audience&#x27;, he said in all earnestness, before bursting into &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;.&quot;

Presley performed &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in his historic &quot;Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite&quot; concert special that was the &quot;first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world,&quot; on January 14, 1973. Beamed via Globecam Satellite to Australia, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, South Vietnam and other countries, it was also seen on a delayed basis in around thirty European countries. An expanded version was broadcast on NBC in the USA on April 4, 1973, on NBC, attracting 51% of the television viewing audience, and was seen in more American households than the July 1969 Moon landing. Eventually it was seen in about forty countries by one billion to 1.5 billion people.

===Awards and accolades===
In 1988, Presley&#x27;s original 1956 RCA recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In December 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it No. 19 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the highest ranked of Presley&#x27;s eleven entries. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed Presley&#x27;s version at number 55 of &quot;Q&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Presley&#x27;s version is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

===Responses===
The commercial success of Presley&#x27;s 1956 RCA version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; precipitated a proliferation of cover versions, answer songs, and parodies. Additionally, &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was translated into several languages, including German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and even Bernese German.

===Other cover versions===
By 1964, Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; had been covered over 26 times, and by 1984, there were at least 85 different cover versions of the song, making it &quot;the best-known and most often recorded Rock &amp; Roll song&quot;. In July 2013 the official Leiber &amp; Stoller website listed 266 different versions of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, but acknowledged that its list is incomplete. Among the notable artists who have covered Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; are: Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps; Jerry Lee Lewis; Chubby Checker; Pat Boone; Sammy Davis Jr.; Betty Everett; Little Richard; The Surfaris; the Everly Brothers; Junior Wells; the Mothers of Invention; The Easybeats; Jimi Hendrix; Vanilla Fudge; Van Morrison; Conway Twitty; John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band; John Entwistle; Carl Perkins; Eric Clapton; James Taylor; and (in 1993) Tiny Tim (in his full baritone voice). In 1999 David Grisman, John Hartford, and Mike Seeger included &quot;Hound Dawg&quot; on their 1999 album &quot;Retrograss&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000.

Australian band Sherbet released &quot;Hound Dog&quot; in 1973 as a non-album single, backed with &quot;Can I Drive You Home?&quot;. It reached number 18 on the Kent Music Report and appeared at number 21 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; year-end chart.

====Beatles and John Lennon cover versions====
As Elvis Presley was a major seminal influence on Paul McCartney and John Lennon, and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was a favorite of the young Lennon and his mother, during The Beatles&#x27; early career &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was one of the songs Lennon and McCartney as the Quarrymen and later as the Beatles played from August 1957 through 1961. No recorded version is known to survive. On August 30, 1972, Lennon performed the song with the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band at Madison Square Garden, New York City, in one of his last charity concerts, and was released on his &quot;Live in New York&quot; album on January 24, 1986. John Lennon also recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; during his huge rehearsal of early Rock and Roll classics (for the Madison Square Garden concert) that was released on the unauthorized album &quot;S.I.R. John Winston Ono Lennon&quot;. Tony Sheridan (who was asked to join the young Beatles) also recorded the Presley version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;.

===Foreign-language versions===
Among those artists who have recorded non-English versions of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; are:
* Ralf Bendix (in German, as &quot;Heut Geh&#x27; Ich Nicht Nach Hause&quot;) (1957); (&quot;Today I&#x27;m Not Going Home&quot;)
* Die Rock and Rollers with the Johannes Fehring Orchestra (in German, as &quot;Das Ist Rock And Roll&quot;) (lyrics: Fini Busch) (1957);
* Dyno Y Los Solitarios (in Mexican Spanish, as &quot;Sabueso&quot;) (1960: Discos Audiomex). (&quot;Hound&quot;)
* Los Rogers (in Spanish, as &quot;El Twist Del Perro&quot;) (1961); (&quot;Dog Twist&quot;)
* Lucky Blondo (in French, as &quot;Un Vieux Chien de Chasse&quot;) on his album &quot;To Elvis from Nashville&quot; (1977: Philips) (&quot;An Old Hound&quot;)
* Angela Ro Ro (in Brazilian Portuguese, as &quot;Hot-Dog&quot;) (1984)
* Züri West (in Bernese German as &quot;Souhung&quot;) on their album &quot;Elvis&quot; (June 15, 1990: Black Cat at Sound Service)
* Aurelio Morata (in Spanish, as &quot;Perra Boba&quot;) &quot;Tributo Al Rey&quot; (1997: Picap)

===Parodies===
After the Presley version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; became a commercial success, Homer and Jethro parodied it as &quot;Houn&#x27; Dawg&quot; (RCA Victor 47–6706; 20–6706), including such lines as: &quot;You look like an Airedale, with the air let out&quot;. Several parodies emphasized the cross-cultural appeal of Presley&#x27;s record. Lalo &quot;Pancho Lopez&quot; Guerrero, the father of Chicano music, released a parody version in 1956 entitled &quot;Pound Dog&quot; (L&amp;M LM1002) about a chihuahua. In January 1957, Jewish American satirist Mickey Katz released a Yinglish novelty song version, &quot;You&#x27;re a Doity Dog&quot; (Capitol F3607), singing with a Yiddish accent, and having a klezmer break between verses. In this &quot;freilach&quot;-rock song, Katz sang &quot;You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a paskudnick&quot;. By March 1957, veteran country singer Cliff Johnson responded to the popularity of Presley&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; by recording his self-penned &quot;Go &#x27;Way Hound Dog (Let Me Sing My Blues)&quot; (Columbia 4-40865; Australia: Coronet Records KW-022), described in &quot;Billboard&quot; as &quot;rockabilly that professes satiation with rockabilly music.&quot; In 1991, Elvis &quot;translator&quot; El Vez, backed by The Memphis Mariachis, released &quot;(You Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a) Chihuahua&quot;, a &quot;Chicano Power parody&quot; that opens with: &quot;You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a Chihuahua/ Yapping all the time.&quot;

Encouraged by the 1994 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot; that &quot;ruled that… musicians do not have to obtain permission from the original artists to perform and record parodies of those compositions&quot;, other parodies of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; emerged subsequently. These include &quot;Found God&quot;, a self-acknowledged parody of Presley&#x27;s version by popular Christian band ApologetiX, which, using the original tune, opens with: &quot;I ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but I found God/It took quite a long time&quot;.

==Litigation==
Over the years &quot;Hound Dog&quot; &quot;has been the subject of an inordinate number of lawsuits&quot;, and &quot;would eventually become one of the most litigated songs in recorded music history&quot;.

===&quot;Lion Music Publishing Company v. Sun Records&quot; (1953)===
====Background====
On September 9, 1952, the copyright application for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was lodged. On the application the words &amp; music are attributed to Don Deadric Robey &amp; Willie Mae Thornton, with the copyright claimants listed as: &quot;Murphy L. Robey (W) &amp; Willie Mae Thornton (A). It was renewed subsequently on May 13, 1980, with the same details.

By the end of 1953 at least six &quot;answer songs&quot; that responded to &#x27;Big Mama&#x27; Thornton&#x27;s original version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; were released. According to Peacock Records&#x27;s Don Robey, these songs were &quot;bastardizations&quot; of the original and reduced its sales potential. These included: 
* &quot;Mr. Hound Dog&#x27;s in Town&quot; recorded on March 18 by Blues shouter Roy Brown for King Records (45–4627). While it had the same melody and many of the same lyrics as the original, Brown is credited as the sole writer.
* &quot;(You Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; But a Female) Hound Dog&quot; (King 45–1212) recorded by vocalist Charlie Gore and guitarist Louis Innis on March 22 for King Records on March 22. This song was credited to Innis, Lois Mann (a pseudonym of King Records owner Syd Nathan, the latter his wife&#x27;s maiden name), and Johnny Otis.
* &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; recorded by blues guitarist John Brim for Chess Records&#x27; Checker subsidiary with Little Walter on blues harp.
* &quot;Real Gone Hound Dog&quot; (Combo 25), &quot;an obscure &#x27;answer&#x27; record to &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;&quot;, recorded by Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones&#x27; with a vocal by Higgins&#x27; brother &quot;Daddy Cleanhead&quot; for Jake Porter&#x27;s Combo Records. The composition was credited to Higgins and Porter (as V. Haven).

However, the most popular of the answer songs to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was &quot;Bear Cat (The Answer To Hound Dog)&quot; (Sun 181) recorded by Memphis disc jockey Rufus Thomas (adopting the nickname, &quot;Rufus &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; Thomas&quot;) at Sun Studios at 706 Union Avenue, Memphis.on March 8, 1953, just two weeks after Thornton&#x27;s original version was released, and even before a review of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; had been published in &quot;Billboard&quot;, While retaining the same melody as &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, Sun founder Sam Phillips wrote new lyrics, in which he altered the gender of the singer, who bemoaned that his woman was a &quot;bear cat&quot;, a Jazz Age slang term for &quot;a hot-blooded or fiery girl&quot;. The record&#x27;s spare electric guitar work by Memphis bluesman Joe Hill Louis was greatly influenced by that of Pete Lewis on the original. According to James M. Salem:

By the end of March, &quot;Bear Cat&quot; was in stores, prompting &quot;Billboard&quot; to describe it as &quot;the fastest answer song to hit the market&quot;. It became both Thomas&#x27; and Sun Records&#x27; first hit, eventually reaching number three on the R&amp;B charts. However, as Phillips claimed a writing credit for the song, a copyright-infringement suit ensued that nearly bankrupted Phillips&#x27; record label.

On March 28, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that, &quot;In an effort to combat what has become a rampant practice by small labels—the rushing out of answers which are similar in melody and/or theme to ditties which have become smash hits—many pubbers are now retaining attorneys. Common practice, of course is to regard the answer as an original. Currently publishers are putting up a fight to protect their originals from unauthorised or infringing answers.&quot; In that same issue, Robey told &quot;Billboard&quot; he had notified the Harry Fox publishing agency &quot;to issue Sun a license on &#x27;Bear Cat&#x27; in order that Robey might collect a royalty&quot;.

On April 4, 1953, Robey wrote to Phillips that, &quot;unless contracts are signed and in the office of Mr. Harris Fox by Wednesday, April 8, 1953, I will be forced to take immediate steps with Court Actions&quot;, hoping &quot;this will not cause any unfriendly relations, but please remember that I have to pay when I intrude upon the rights of others, and certainly must protect my own rights.&quot; On April 11 Bob Rolontz reported in &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;The answers to r&amp;b tunes, which have become prolific with the many replies to such smash hits as &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Know&#x27;, &#x27;Mama&#x27; and &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; are being given a serious scrutiny by the original copyright holders of the tunes on the original hit waxings. It appears they do not think too highly of writing an answer to a hit unless a license is obtained and permission to write a parody is given by the publisher.&quot; On the prior page, Peacock Records placed an advertisement promoting Thornton&#x27;s release as &quot;The Original Version of &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27;&quot;, warning: &quot;Beware of Imitations – Follow the Leader for Good Results&quot; before reminding the reader: &quot;The Original – The Best&quot;. Two pages later, Intro Records touted the version by Tommy Duncan and the Miller Bros. as &quot;Best of them all!!!&quot;

====Proceedings====
Their requests for payment having been ignored, Robey and two other music publishers initiated unprecedented legal proceedings in April against the record companies that released these competing songs, alleging copyright infringement. As a result, Chess Records withdrew Brim&#x27;s &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; from sale. In the Memphis courts, Lion Publishing Co. sought royalties and treble damages, claiming &quot;Bear Cat&quot; was &quot;a dead steal&quot;. In May, Phillips responded: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of difference in the words. As for the tune, there&#x27;s practically no melody, but a rhythm pattern&quot;, adding that it is hard to differentiate between any two 12-bar blues songs. By June 1953 in a &quot;precedent-setting&quot; decision the Court ruled against Phillips, and upheld the charges of plagiarism, finding the tune and some of the lyrics of &quot;Bear Cat&quot; to be identical to those of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Phillips was ordered to pay 2% of all of the profits of &quot;Bear Cat&quot; plus court costs. As this amounted to $35,000 compensation, Phillips was reduced to near bankruptcy, ultimately forcing him to sell Elvis Presley&#x27;s Sun contract to RCA for $35,000 to raise the funds to settle his debts. On June 4, 1953, &quot;Jet&quot; reported that:
:&quot;The Sun Record Company of Memphis agreed to pay $2,080 to a Texas Recording firm because its blues tune, &quot;Bear Cat&quot;, is too similar to &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Lion Publishing Company of Houston, Tex., won the out-of-court settlement after contending in a court suit that &quot;Bear Cat&quot; was a &quot;conscious imitation&quot; of their own recording with &quot;only minor variations&quot;. Sam C. Phillips of Sun Record agreed to pay &quot;Hound Dog&quot; owners two cents per record for 79,000 waxings of &quot;Bear Cat&quot; already sold and two cents a record for future sales.

On July 8 Robey wrote to Phillips again, thanking him &quot;kindly for your co-operation in this matter&quot;, but Phillips still refused to purchase a mechanical license for Thomas&#x27; &quot;Bear Cat&quot;. Robey then instructed his company lawyer Irving Marcus to sue Phillips and Sun Records, hoping to use this as a test case to determine the legal status of all answer songs. While earlier pressings of Sun 181 bore the caption &quot;(The Answer To Hound Dog)&quot; above the A-side title, as a result of the legal action this was removed from all later pressings. In the 1980s, Sam Phillips conceded: &quot;I should have known better. The melody was exactly the same as theirs, but we claimed the credit for writing the damn thing&quot;.

===&quot;King Records vs Lion Publishing Co.&quot; and &quot;Lion Publishing Co. vs King Records &amp; Valjo Music&quot; (1953)===
In late July 1953 Syd Nathan, president of King Records, took Robey and his Lion Publishing Company to court. The August 1, 1953 &quot;Billboard&quot; reported: &quot;Lion [Music] itself was in court defending the contention of in Cincinnati that he had an interest in the song &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; and should have a fifty per cent share of its success.&quot; Nathan claimed that Valjo Music, one of King Records&#x27; publishing affiliates, had legal rights to the song as Johnny Otis, who claimed to be a co-author, was under exclusive contract to them at the time. An article entitled &quot;New Howl Goes Up Over &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; Infringement&quot; in &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; of August 8, 1953 reported:
:You ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a hound dog&quot; is becoming a battle cry faster than a pup can clean a bone. &quot;Hound Dog&quot; has been howling on the juke boxes for several months and all this time the record has been hounded by imitations and sundry other misfortunes. One thing is sure: this is the most profitable hound dog since Eliza slid across the ice. This is the latest episode: King Records joined the pack this week in the legal hassle over who&#x27;s gonna get the profits from the current rhythm Dog.&quot; ... Valjo, meanwhile, is complaining that one of the writers of the tune, Johnny Otis, was under exclusive contract to them when he wrote the tune in collaboration with others and they are claiming 50 per cent of the publisher&#x27;s share of the tune. At any rate, on it goes and the big problem now seems to be, how much Is that &quot;Hound Dog&quot; In the juke box worth?

In response, Robey counter-sued both King Records and Valjo Music over Roy Brown&#x27;s answer record, and also over Little Esther&#x27;s cover record (King 12126). When the dust settled, the publishing for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (in all variations) remained with Lion, and writing credit with Leiber and Stoller. In April, 1954, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Rolontz summed up the events thusly: &quot;The year 1953 saw an important precedent set in regard to answer tunes … since the &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; decision, few record firms have attempted to &#x27;answer&#x27; smash hits by other companies by using same tune with different lyrics.&quot;

===&quot;Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v. Elvis Presley Music&quot; (1956–1957)===
The most protracted lawsuit involving &quot;Hound Dog&quot; was &quot;Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v. Elvis Presley Music&quot; that was initiated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in October 1956, after the commercial success of Elvis Presley&#x27;s version of the song, and concluded in December 1957. It would be the first &quot;legal spat&quot; for Presley&#x27;s publishing company, Elvis Presley Music.

====Background====
Leiber and Stoller were introduced to Otis in July 1952 by Federal Records&#x27; Ralph Bass when Otis needed songs for artists he was recording for Federal, including Little Esther, Little Willie Littlefield, and Bobby Nunn of The Robins. In exchange for Otis using their songs, Leiber and Stoller gave Otis a one-third interest in those songs and assigned the publishing to Otis&#x27; company, Valjo Music Publishing Company. Similarly, on August 30, 1952, Leiber and Stoller signed a contract with Spin Music Inc.—another publishing company in which Otis held an interest—assigning it certain rights to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and some other songs in exchange for royalties to be divided equally between Leiber, Stoller, and Otis. When the song was copyrighted initially on September 9, 1952, words and music were credited to Don Deadric Robey and Willie Mae Thornton, with Lion Publishing Co. identified as the registered publisher. However, on March 26, 1953, it was credited to Leiber, Stoller, and Otis; and Valjo Music—not Spin—was the registered publisher.

According to the findings of the court in &quot;Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v. Elvis Presley Music&quot;: &quot;Thereafter Otis, in apparent disregard of the contracts both with Spin Music Inc. and plaintiff, arranged to have &#x27;Hound Dog&#x27; published by Lion Music Publishing Company of Houston, Texas, and released by its affiliate Peacock Records. Otis executed a writer-publisher contract on October 10, 1952, with Lion Music Publishing Company in which Leiber, Otis and Stoller were described as the writers of &#x27;Hound Dog.&#x27;&quot; Thus, Otis received a co-writing credit with Leiber and Stoller on Thornton&#x27;s Peacock Records release and on all of the 1953 cover versions. The court also noted: &quot;Otis signed not only his name but also signed—or perhaps forged—the names of Stoller and Leiber to it. The president or proprietor of Lion Music Publishing Company noted the similarity of the handwriting of the signatures and made contact with Leiber and Stoller who advised him that Otis had no authority to sign their names to the agreement and that Otis was not a co-author of the song, although he was entitled to receive one-third of the royalties. Lion then arranged for a contract with Leiber and Stoller alone for the publishing rights.&quot; In order for Leiber and Stoller to execute the contract with Lion—&quot;which, because we were underage, had to be signed by our mothers&quot;—a court appointed Mary Stein (for Leiber) and Adelyn Stoller (for Stoller) as their legal guardians in late April 1953. The contract assigned the publishing for &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to Lion. Otis&#x27; credit was omitted from all subsequent records. Following on the popularity of Elvis&#x27; live and televised performances of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, Elvis Presley Music made the acquisition of half the publishing for the song from Lion Music a precondition to issuing a recording, to which Robey assented.

====Proceedings====
In October 1956, the success of Presley&#x27;s version (sales at that time exceeded 2 million copies) prompted Valjo to sue Leiber and Stoller and Elvis Presley Music (an affiliate of Hill &amp; Range Songs) for an accounting of profits and for damages and to have Otis restored as co-writer and recover damages for lost royalties. In &quot;Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v. Elvis Presley Music&quot;, Otis as plaintiff alleged that he was the co-author of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; along with two defendants, Leiber and Stoller. The defendants denied that Otis wrote any part of the song. On August 26, 1956, Otis signed a release of any claims to the song in exchange for $750. In court, Otis claimed that he had done so because he had learned that the defendants were legally infants at the time of the original contracts in 1952, and would, therefore, disaffirm any contract that they had with him. This made no sense to the United States Southern District of Court of New York: &quot;Otis was a man who had many years experience in the music business. He must have realized that even though Leiber and Stoller were infants they could not disaffirm his co-authorship of a song, if in fact he had been a co-author.&quot; Further, while Leiber and Stoller acknowledged that they had given Otis one-third of the mechanical rights for the original Thornton recording, they denied giving him one-third authorship credit. On December 4, 1957, Federal Court Judge Archie O. Dawson dismissed Valjo&#x27;s claim in the New York Federal Court, on the basis that Otis was &quot;unworthy of belief&quot;, that he admitted forging Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s signatures on a declaration to third-party publisher Lion Music, that Leiber and Stoller were underage at the time, and that Otis had signed a release to any claims for $750. As the evidence would not sustain Valjo&#x27;s contention that Otis had collaborated in the writing of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, the Court voided Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s contract, ordered Otis to pay the legal costs of the defendants, and awarded 46.25% of the song to Leiber and Stoller, with Lion Music receiving 28.75% and Elvis Presley Music receiving the final 25%.

Despite the Court&#x27;s findings, Otis continued to claim that he wrote the third verse and rewrote some of the lyrics in the second verse—including adding &quot;You made me feel so bad. You make me weep and moan. You ain&#x27;t looking for a woman. You&#x27;re looking for a home&quot;—and edited out what he described later as &quot;derogatory crap&quot;. In 2000, Otis claimed: &quot;Leiber and Stoller brought me the song, &#x27;Hound Dog,&#x27;&quot; Otis recalls, of the time he produced Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s recording of what was to become an R&amp;B, and then rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, classic. &quot;Parts of it weren&#x27;t really acceptable. I didn&#x27;t like that reference to chicken and watermelon, said &#x27;Let&#x27;s get that crap out of there.&#x27;... This came out and was a big smash, and everything was all right. I had half the publishing rights and one third of the song-writing. Then Elvis Presley made it a mega hit, and they got greedy. They sued me in court. They won, they beat me out of it. I could have sent my kids to college, like they sent theirs,&quot; Otis said. &quot;But, oh well, if I dwell on that I get quite unhappy, so we try to move on.&quot; However, Leiber and Stoller maintained consistently and emphatically that Otis was &quot;&quot;not&quot; a writer of the song&quot; (emphasis theirs).

As he had provided lyrics for the version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; recorded by Presley, Freddie Bell &quot;sued to get some of the composer royalties because he had changed the words and indeed the song, and he would have made millions as the songwriter of Elvis&#x27; version: but he lost because he did not ask Leiber &amp; Stoller for permission&quot; to make those changes.

==In popular culture==
* The song was included in the 1996 stage musical, &quot;Hound Dog: A Hip hOpera&quot;, a musical send-up that was written, and produced by Jeff Rake, that ran for three months at Hollywood&#x27;s Hudson Theatre, receiving five &quot;LA Weekly&quot; Theatre Award nominations, including Musical of the Year.
* In 2022 Big Mama Thornton was featured as a character in &quot;Elvis&quot;, a biopic about Elvis Presley. In the movie, Thornton (played by Shonka Dukureh in her only film role, as she died shortly after the film&#x27;s release) is shown as the original singer of the song &quot;Hound Dog&quot; and appears in the movie singing the song. Presley (played by Austin Butler) hears Thornton sing the song at a concert and decides to record a cover version. Dukureh&#x27;s performance of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; is included in full on the movie soundtrack.
* The AGM-28 Hound Dog missile&#x27;s name is inspired by Presley&#x27;s version of the song. The missiles were air-launched supersonic missiles designed to destroy heavily defended ground targets. Almost 700 AGM-28s were built.

<doc id="785483" wikidata="Q4939604" url="?curid=785483" title="2004 Bolivian gas referendum">
<text>A referendum on natural gas reserves was held in Bolivia on 18 July 2004. Voters were asked five questions on the government&#x27;s policy on natural gas, with all five approved.

==Background==
Holding a referendum on the use of the country&#x27;s gas reserves was one of the first promises made by President Carlos Mesa upon assuming the presidency in the aftermath of the Bolivian Gas War of October 2003 that saw his predecessor, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, forced to resign and to flee the country.

The referendum was largely intended to quell the political unrest seen during the Gas War. Fears of an uprising led the Bolivian government to take measures essentially forcing the population to vote (announcing fines and other penalties for those who refused or boycotted) and warned that protesters against the referendum would be imprisoned.

==Results==
Do you agree that the Hydrocarbons Law (No. 1689), enacted by Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, should be repealed?

Do you agree that the Bolivian State should recover ownership over all hydrocarbons at the wellhead?

Do you agree that Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos should be re-established, reclaiming state ownership of the Bolivian people&#x27;s stakes in the part-privatized oil companies, so that it can take part in all stages of the hydrocarbon production chain?

Do you agree with President Carlos Mesa&#x27;s policy of using gas as a strategic recourse to achieve a sovereign and viable route of access to the Pacific Ocean?

Do you or do you not agree that Bolivia should export gas as part of a national policy framework that ensures the gas needs of Bolivians; encourages the industrialization of gas in the nation&#x27;s territory; levies taxes and/or royalties of up to 50% of the production value of oil and gas on oil companies, for the nation&#x27;s benefit; and earmarks revenues from the export and industrialization of gas mainly for education, health, roads, and jobs?

<doc id="785488" wikidata="Q507792" url="?curid=785488" title="The Singing Ringing Tree">
<text>The Singing Ringing Tree () is a 1957 children&#x27;s fantasy film from East German studio DEFA. Directed by Francesco Stefani, the screenplay by Anne Geelhaar is based on a variation of &quot;The Dwarf, the Fox and the Princess (Hurleburlebutz)&quot; story published in Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales (1843) by the Brothers Grimm.

==Plot summary==
The story concerns a beautiful but selfish and haughty princess who rejects the proposal of a wealthy prince. She scorns the gifts he offers her, and says that she will marry him only if he brings her the mythical &quot;singing ringing tree&quot;. The prince locates the tree in the territory of an evil dwarf, who offers to give him the enchanted tree, on the understanding that, if the princess still rejects him, he will be in the dwarf&#x27;s power and will be turned into a bear. Because the tree will only sing and ring when the princess falls in love with the prince, she is disappointed in it and continues to reject the prince. The prince is forced to return to the dwarf&#x27;s lair and is turned into a bear.

The princess sends her father to find the singing ringing tree for her, but he is met by the prince, in the guise of a bear, who gives him the tree on condition that the king returns with the first thing the king sees on his return. This turns out to be the princess, who is now delivered into the hands of the dwarf. The dwarf, seeing the princess&#x27;s self-centred behaviour, casts a spell to make her ugly. The bear tells her that she will regain her beauty only if she changes her ways. Gradually she is won over by the bear and becomes beautiful again. Despite the dwarf&#x27;s attempts to keep her and the prince apart, she eventually falls in love with him and the singing ringing tree finally lives up to its name.

==Cast==
In credits order.
* Christel Bodenstein as the haughty princess
* Charles Hans Vogt as the king
* Eckart Dux as the handsome prince/bear
* Richard Krüger as the dwarf
* Dorothea Tiesing as the nurse
* Günther Polensen as the captain of the guard
* Fredy Barton as the minister
* Egon Vogel as captain and master of ceremonies
* Paul Knopf as the guardian
* Paul Pfingst as Bauer
* Friedrich Teitge as the gardener
* Maria Besendahl (Anna-Maria Besendahl) as the herbalist
* Tony Bilbow (English narration) as Antony Bilbow

==Production==
The film was shot in colour entirely in the studio in Potsdam, Brandenburg, East Germany. There was later confusion as to whether the actor who played the dwarf was named Richard Krüger and died in Strasbourg, or was Hermann Emmrich who died in 1995 and is buried in Prenzlau in north eastern Germany. It is now thought that they were one and the same person.

==Release==
&quot;The Singing Ringing Tree&quot; was theatrically released in East Germany in 1957, where it sold 5,901,141 tickets in the country of about 17 million. The film was then purchased by the BBC and cut into three parts to create a mini-series with an English-language voice-over track where the original soundtrack was simply faded up and down as opposed to being dubbed. According to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; entries in BBC Genome Project, it was first broadcast on BBC 1 on 19 and 26 November, and 3 December 1964 as part of the &quot;Tales from Europe&quot; strand. It was then repeated in March 1966, November 1969, October 1971, September 1976, April 1977 and August 1980.

The original film version has been released in many countries on VHS, DVD and streaming services, and on Blu-ray in Germany by Icestorm Entertainment and the UK by Network Distributing. Both Blu-rays have the film in both its original widescreen theatrical and 1.33:1 television aspect ratios. They also have the original German-language soundtrack with optional voice-over tracks in English, French and Spanish, and various extra features.

== UK reactions ==
The TV series, partly due to its foreignness as both fairy tale and for the unfamiliarity of its German production, was &#x27;indelibly carved on the psyches&#x27; as &#x27;one of the most frightening things ever shown on children&#x27;s television&#x27;. The release of the film on home video also spurred renewed interest. A &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 2004 voted this programme the 20th spookiest TV show ever.

===&quot;The Fast Show&quot; parody===
A spoof of the series was created as a sketch in the last season of &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, entitled, &quot;The Singing Ringing Binging Plinging Tinging Plinking Plonking Boinging Tree&quot;.

<doc id="785499" wikidata="Q3990089" url="?curid=785499" title="The Wonder of You">
<text>&quot;The Wonder of You&quot; is a song written by Baker Knight. It was originally recorded by Vince Edwards in 1958, but this recording has never been released.
In an interview with a DJ from Chattanooga, Tennessee, Ray Peterson told the story of how Baker Knight confided that &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; was originally written as a gospel song.

==Ray Peterson recording==
In 1959, &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; was first released by Ray Peterson as a single. The song became a Top 40 hit for him on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at #25, and it briefly re-entered the Hot 100 peaking at #70, in 1964. The 1959 Ray Peterson recording also reached #23 on the UK Singles Chart and Canada.

==Elvis Presley version==
Elvis Presley had a No. 1 hit in the UK and a Top 10 hit in the U.S. with his 1970 live version of &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; recorded in Las Vegas, Nevada in February 1970 and released on his live album &quot;On Stage&quot;. The song was released as a single on April 20, 1970, backed by the song &quot;Mama Liked the Roses&quot;. In the United States, both songs charted at #9 together during 27 June - 11 July 1970. The song reached #7 in Canada. &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; was one of his most successful records in the UK ever, topping the UK Singles Chart for six weeks in the summer of that year. It has sold over 400,000 equivalent units in the UK, qualifying the single for a gold sales certification in 2022. It also stayed at number one in the Irish Singles Chart for three weeks that same year. This was the 59th Top 40 hit of his career. Presley&#x27;s version also reached number 37 on the US Country Singles chart, and number one on the easy listening chart.

&quot;The Wonder of You&quot; was one of about thirty-five songs Presley would regularly perform at concerts.

According to Peterson, &quot;He [Elvis] asked me if I would mind if he recorded &#x27;The Wonder of You.&#x27; I said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t have to ask permission; you&#x27;re Elvis Presley.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Yes, I do. You&#x27;re Ray Peterson.&#x27;&quot;

In 2016, a version of the song featuring the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released together with other orchestral versions of Elvis songs in the album &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;.

==Other recordings==
*Also in 1959, it was recorded by Ronnie Hilton. His version was also a hit reaching #22 on the UK Singles Chart. The song later appeared on the 2017 second season episode &quot;Matrimonium&quot; of the TV series &quot;The Crown&quot;. 
*In the early 1960s, the Platters also recorded this song, which appeared on a 1970s compilation &quot;The Platters – 30 Golden Hits&quot;.
*In 1969, The Sandpipers recorded an album of the same name including the song.
*An album of instrumentals of the same name by Nelson Riddle was also released in 2000.
*In 2017, Conor O&#x27;Brien recorded the song for &quot;Big Little Lies&quot; that was sung by Ed Mackenzie (played by Adam Scott) in the first-season finale &quot;You Get What You Need&quot;.
*Uruguayan punk/rockabilly band Rudos Wild recorded the song for their debut album &quot;Psychos With Wax.&quot;

==Popularity in association football==
The song has been adopted by English Association football club Port Vale, which runs out to the song at the start of its home matches, while the club&#x27;s fans sing the song throughout their matches, periodically with altered lyrics. Arsenal Football Club also adopted the song as their opening anthem upon their move to the Emirates Stadium.

Scottish club Ross County have also adopted the song as an anthem at the end of home matches.

<text>Angoulême (&quot;L&#x27;Angoumois&quot;) in western France was part of the Carolingian Kingdom of Aquitaine. Under Charlemagne&#x27;s successors, the local count of Angoulême was independent and the county was not united with the French crown until 1308. By the terms of the Treaty of Brétigny (1360) the Angoumois, then ruled by the counts of Angoulême, was ceded to King Edward III of England. In 1371 it became a fief of Duke John of Berry and then passed to Duke Louis I of Orleans, both of whom were cadets of the French royal family. From then on it was held by cadets of the Valois House of Orleans, until Francis of Angoulême, became king of France in 1515. Angoumois was definitively incorporated into the French crown lands, as a duchy.

<doc id="785505" wikidata="Q2138196" url="?curid=785505" title="Starkenburg">
<text>Starkenburg is an historical region in the State of Hesse, Germany, comprising the area south of the Main River and east of the Rhine, around the regional capital Darmstadt.

==Geography==

The region is named after Starkenburg Castle, above Heppenheim on the historic Bergstraße Route. Beside the cities of Darmstadt and Offenbach, it consists of the modern districts (&quot;kreise&quot;):
* Bergstraße
* Darmstadt-Dieburg
* Groß-Gerau
* Odenwaldkreis
* Offenbach
The area comprises about , roughly equivalent to the German state of Saarland.

==History==

Starkenburg Castle was erected about 1065 to protect the estates around Lorsch Abbey, which itself were held by the Prince-Archbishopric of Mainz from the 13th century onwards. Upon the German mediatisation of 1803, the southern territories of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt—including the former Mainz lands on the Bergstraße—were incorporated into the newly established Principality (from 1816: Province) of Starkenburg. Elevated to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1806, the possessions in Starkenburg, as well as in the provinces of Upper Hesse in the north and Rhenish Hesse in the west were confirmed by resolution of the 1815 Vienna Congress.

From 1832 the administration was subdivided into seven districts (&quot;kreise&quot;):
* Bensheim 
* Heppenheim, with the exclave of Wimpfen
both districts were merged into Bergstraße in 1938
* Erbach, renamed Odenwaldkreis in 1972
* Darmstadt, divided into an urban and a rural district in 1938
* Dieburg, merged with the Darmstadt rural district in 1977
* Groß-Gerau 
* Offenbach, from 1874 with the Upper Hessian exclave of Steinbach, divided into an urban and a rural district in 1938.
With the establishment of the present State of Hesse, Wimpfen and Steinbach were separated from the Starkenburg region; in turn, the Bischofsheim and Ginsheim-Gustavsburg quarters of the City of Mainz, located east of the Rhine River, passed to the Groß-Gerau district. A former administrative union of the Starkenburg districts was dissolved in 2007.

==Economy==
Today the Starkenburg Economic Development Agency run in cooperation with the Darmstadt chamber of commerce as a registered association coordinates the efforts of the government units in marketing the region to technology companies. Among the main issues are the development within the Frankfurt Rhine-Main metropolitan area and the construction of the Frankfurt–Mannheim high-speed railway.</text><links>

<text>&quot;Way Down&quot; is a song recorded by Elvis Presley. Recorded in October 1976, it was his last single released before his death on August 16, 1977. The song was written by Layng Martine Jr. and recorded by Presley at his home studio in Graceland on 29 October 1976.

Released as a single (with &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; on the B-side) on June 6, 1977, it was his latest single at the time of his death. It initially peaked at No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart dated August 6, 1977 and had fallen to No. 53 on the chart for the week ending August 27, 1977. Thereafter, it reversed direction and reached an even higher peak at No. 18 on 24 September – 1 October 1977. &quot;Way Down&quot; reached No. 1 on the American Country chart the week he died. The single was certified platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA in 1999. 

On the UK Singles Chart, after having climbed only four places to number 42 the week before Presley&#x27;s death, the track rose to number four the following week and then hit number one in the week ending 3 September and stayed there for five weeks, just over seven years after his previous 16th UK number one single, &quot;The Wonder of You&quot;, in August 1970. His previous single, &quot;Moody Blue&quot;, had been a number one hit on the US Country charts earlier in 1977. &quot;Way Down&quot; was reissued in April 2005 and reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart.

The recording also featured J.D. Sumner singing the words &quot;way on down&quot; at the end of each chorus down to the note low C (C2). At the end of the song, this phrase is octaved, reaching a double low C (C1, three octaves below middle C). This note was first accomplished by Sumner in a 1966 recording of the hymn &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;.

<doc id="785568" wikidata="Q407206" url="?curid=785568" title="Air and Space Training Ribbon">
<text>The Air and Space Training Ribbon (ASTR) is the lowest military award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, ranking only above foreign military awards.

The Air and Space Training Ribbon was authorized as the Air Force Training Ribbon by the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force on 12 October 1980. It is awarded to U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force service members on completion of initial accession training after 14 August 1974. Initial accession training in USAF is defined as Basic Military Training (BMT) for enlisted personnel, Basic Cadet Training (BCT) at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), or commissioning through Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), Officer Training School (OTS) or other specialized USAF officer accession programs.

In December 1986, the criteria expanded and authorized the ribbon to anyone who was on active duty in December 1986, regardless of when they completed initial accession training. The ribbon was designed by the Institute of Heraldry. The ribbon has a wide center stripe of red, flanked on either side by a wide stripe of dark blue and a narrow yellow stripe edged by a narrow dark blue stripe.

On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Training Ribbon was renamed to the Air and Space Training Ribbon by the Secretary of the Air Force.
== Devices and subsequent awards ==

The Air and Space Training Ribbon may not be awarded for completing flight training, technical training, career development courses, professional military education (PME) and other services&#x27; basic training or officer training. USAF or USSF enlisted personnel who initially accessed through BMT who later complete USAF or USSF officer accession training (i.e., OTS, AFROTC, USAFA and so forth) are entitled to a subsequent award denoted by a bronze oak leaf cluster.

Officers who complete Air Force or Space Force officer accession training, but completed their enlisted training in the Army, receive the Air and Space Training Ribbon on the basis of their officer accessions and wear it in addition to the Army Service Ribbon.

Authorized Device: Oak Leaf Cluster

== Sister service equivalents ==

The United States Army grants the Army Service Ribbon in a manner similar to the Air and Space Training Ribbon.

The United States Navy and United States Coast Guard do not have an award corresponding to the Air and Space Training Ribbon. The ribbon is prohibited on all USN and USCG uniforms worn by former USAF or USSF personnel.

The United States Marine Corps does not have an equivalent ribbon, but instead awards their trademark Eagle, Globe &amp; Anchor insignia upon completion of Recruit Training or Officer Candidate School, or at commissioning for those Marine Corps officers accessed via the United States Naval Academy (USNA), Naval ROTC (NROTC) Marine Corps Option or USMC Platoon Leaders Class (PLC). Like the Navy and the Coast Guard, wear of the Air and Space Training Ribbon is also prohibited on all USMC uniforms worn by former USAF or USSF personnel.

<doc id="785584" wikidata="Q4583001" url="?curid=785584" title="Barry Farber">
<text>Barry Morton Farber (May 5, 1930 – May 6, 2020) was an American conservative radio talk show host, author, commentator and language-learning enthusiast. In 2002, industry publication &quot;Talkers magazine&quot; ranked him the 9th greatest radio talk show host of all time. He also wrote articles appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. He was the father of journalist Celia Farber and singer-songwriter Bibi Farber.

==Early life and language learning==
Farber was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Sophie (Marcus) and Raymond Farber, who both worked on the family&#x27;s Jay-Ray Sportswear line. Farber was Jewish and grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina.

After nearly failing Latin in the ninth grade, that summer Farber started reading a Mandarin Chinese language-learning book. A trip to Miami Beach, Florida, to see his grandparents, coincidentally put him in the midst of a large number of Chinese navy sailors in training there. His Chinese rapidly improved.

Back in Greensboro, he took up Italian, Spanish, and French on his own before summer vacation was over. He started taking French and Spanish classes in his sophomore year and also learned Norwegian on his own while in high school. He graduated in 1948 from Greensboro Senior High School (see Grimsley High School).

He then attended the University of North Carolina, where he learned Russian. As a delegate from the National Student Association to what he later called a &quot;Tito propaganda fiesta called the Zagreb Peace Conference&quot;, he found other Slavic languages were closely related to Russian. A 16-day boat trip back to the United States with Yugoslavs allowed him to practice his Serbo-Croatian. After covering the 1952 Summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, he learned Indonesian on another boat trip back to the U.S.

As a newspaper reporter in 1956, Farber was invited by the United States Air Force to cover the airlift of Hungarian refugees from the uprising in Hungary that year. In an Austrian border village, Farber later wrote, he so impressed a Norwegian man, Thorvald Stoltenberg, with knowledge of the man&#x27;s native tongue that he was allowed to go on one of the covert missions smuggling Hungarians into Austria.

Farber had knowledge of more than 25 languages, including the ones mentioned above. He published a book titled &quot;How to Learn Any Language&quot; that detailed his method for self-study. It employed a multi-track study of the language, the use of memory aids for vocabulary, and the utilization of &quot;hidden moments&quot; throughout the day.

Farber preferred to say that he was a student of a certain number of languages, rather than saying that he spoke them. Of the languages he studied, half he &quot;dates&quot; and the other half he &quot;marries&quot;. According to Farber: &quot;By languages I date, I mean no grammar and no script, languages like Bengali.&quot;

Aside from Bengali, the 25 foreign languages he studied include these 19 (&quot;marriage&quot; or &quot;dating&quot; specified, when known): Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish (marriage), Swedish and Yiddish, as well as Bulgarian and Korean. Barry could speak and read some Albanian, and was enthusiastic about expanding his vocabulary of the language.

Farber&#x27;s book, &quot;How to Learn any Language&quot; never specifies all of the 25 languages that his publicity materials say he studied. He said in the book that when he was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1952, he was &quot;tested and qualified for work in fourteen different languages&quot; and since learned more in some of those languages as well as the others. He mentioned in the 2005 interview that he still constantly learned bits and pieces of new language—some Albanian phrases or a new phrase each time he went into a grocery store where a Tibetan woman works.

==Radio career==
His radio career began in New York City, working as the producer for the Tex and Jinx (Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg) interview program. It was a live remote from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, broadcast over 660 WNBC in the mid-1950s from 10:30 PM to midnight, Monday through Friday.

William Safire hired Farber as a producer. Farber eventually hosted his own show on 1010 WINS.

Begun in 1960, his first talk show was called &quot;Barry Farber’s WINS Open Mike&quot;. It was the only talk show on what was then a rock n’ roll station and was on weeknights at 11. He left that job for an evening talk show on WOR in 1962, and then became an all-night host in 1967.

In November 1977, Kaiser Broadcasting debuted a weekly talk show hosted by Farber as a replacement to its program hosted by Lou Gordon, who died earlier that year, but it was short-lived.

Farber then joined 570 WMCA for an afternoon drive time talk show, which lasted until 1989 when WMCA changed its format to Christian radio.

In 1990, he became a national talk-show host on the ABC Radio Network, which was trying to build a group of nationwide talk shows at the time. Lynn Samuels, a liberal, was forced to share her local 770 WABC show with Farber which led to on-air confrontations, and resulted in her departure from the station. ABC&#x27;s project later was abandoned, and Farber, Michael Castello, and Alan Colmes got together and quickly formed their own independent network called Daynet. He eventually joined Talk Radio Network as a weekend and fill-in host until that network ceased operations in 2017.

Farber then moved to CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks, hosting a one-hour weekday show.

Early in the 1970s, Farber was an adjunct professor of journalism at St. John&#x27;s University in New York. Often, his former students were heard calling his radio program with admiring words and memories.

On the radio, Farber became easily identifiable by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved his ability to deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always sounded like he truly believed in the product.

In 1991 he was named &quot;Talk Show Host of The Year&quot; by the National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts.

In 2008 Farber married Sara Pentz, a television news reporter and journalist.

Farber was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Political philosophy and career==

In his youth, Farber fell in love with Norway, marrying Norwegian national Ulla Fahre. He embraced the Social Democracy popular in that Scandinavian nation. During the 1960s, his political commentary combined militant opposition to Soviet Communism with lavish praise for the achievements of Social Democracy, which he patriotically hoped America would one day adopt. But when the long-incumbent Swedish Social Democrats faced defeat at the polls, he began to re-examine his beliefs and would come to advocate the liberal economics popular among those called conservatives in America.

At one time a Democrat, in 1970 he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York City&#x27;s 19th district as the candidate of the Republican and Liberal parties, in a lively uphill race. His main opponent was Liberal Democrat Bella Abzug, the victor. In 1977, Farber left his talk-radio career for a time to run for Mayor of New York City as the candidate of the Conservative party, receiving almost as many votes as the Republican candidate, but vastly fewer than winner Democrat Ed Koch.

==Death==
Farber, who vowed never to completely retire from broadcasting, remained active on his CRN show until the day before his death, appearing to celebrate his 90th birthday. The day after, on May 6, 2020, Farber died at his home. He had been in declining health following a series of falls.

<text>The Mexican War of Independence (, 16 September 1810 – 27 September 1821) was an armed conflict and political process resulting in Mexico&#x27;s independence from the Spanish Empire. It was not a single, coherent event, but local and regional struggles that occurred within the same period, and can be considered a revolutionary civil war. It culminated with the drafting of the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire in Mexico City on September 28, 1821, following the collapse of royal government and the military triumph of forces for independence.

Mexican independence from Spain was not an inevitable outcome of the relationship between the Spanish Empire and its most valuable overseas possession, but events in Spain had a direct impact on the outbreak of the armed insurgency in 1810 and the course of warfare through the end of the conflict. Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s invasion of Spain in 1808 touched off a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule, since he had placed his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne after forcing the abdication of the Spanish monarch Charles IV. In Spain and many of its overseas possessions, the local response was to set up juntas, ruling in the name of the Bourbon monarchy. Delegates in Spain and overseas territories met in Cádiz—a small corner of the Iberian Peninsula still under Spanish control—as the Cortes of Cádiz, and drafted the Spanish Constitution of 1812. That constitution sought to create a new governing framework in the absence of the legitimate Spanish monarch. It tried to accommodate the aspirations of American-born Spaniards (&quot;criollos&quot;) for more local control and equal standing with Peninsular-born Spaniards, known locally as peninsulares. This political process had far-reaching impacts in New Spain during the independence war and beyond. Pre-existing cultural, religious, and racial divides in Mexico played a major role in not only the development of the independence movement but also the development of the conflict as it progressed.

The conflict had several phases. The first uprising for independence was led by parish priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who issued the Cry of Dolores on 16 September 1810. The revolt was massive and not well organized. Hidalgo was captured by royalist forces, defrocked from the priesthood, and executed in July 1811. The second phase of the insurgency was led by Father José María Morelos, who was captured by royalist forces and executed in 1815. The insurgency devolved into guerrilla warfare, with Vicente Guerrero emerging as a leader. Neither royalists nor insurgents gained the upper hand, with military stalemate continuing until 1821, when former royalist commander Agustín de Iturbide made an alliance with Guerrero under the Plan of Iguala in 1821. They formed a unified military force rapidly bringing about the collapse of royal government and the establishment of independent Mexico. The unexpected turn of events in Mexico was prompted by events in Spain. When Spanish liberals overthrew the autocratic rule of Ferdinand VII in 1820, conservatives in New Spain saw political independence as a way to maintain their position. The unified military force entered Mexico City in triumph in September 1821 and the Spanish viceroy Juan O&#x27;Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba, ending Spanish rule.

Following independence, the mainland of New Spain was organized as the First Mexican Empire, led by Agustín de Iturbide. This ephemeral constitutional monarchy was overthrown and a federal republic was declared in 1823 and codified in the Constitution of 1824. After some Spanish reconquest attempts, including the expedition of Isidro Barradas in 1829, Spain under the rule of Isabella II recognized the independence of Mexico in 1836.

== Prior challenges to crown rule ==
There is evidence that even from an early period in post-conquest Mexican history, some began articulating the idea of a separate Mexican identity, though at the time this would have occurred only among elite Creole circles. Despite these murmurings of independence, serious challenges to Spanish imperial power before 1810 were rare and relatively isolated.

One early challenge to crown authority came after the introduction of the New Laws in 1542 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Under these laws, the grants of the &quot;encomenderos&quot; were to be ended following the deaths of the current grant holders. The &quot;encomenderos&quot;&#x27; conspiracy included Don Martín Cortés, son of Hernán Cortés, who was exiled, with other conspirators executed.

Another challenge to crown authority occurred in 1624 when elites ousted the reformist Viceroy Diego Carrillo de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Gelves, who sought to break up crime rackets from which the elites profited and curtail opulent displays of clerical power. The viceroy was removed following an urban religious riot of Mexico City commoners in 1624 stirred up by the elites. The crowd, which was mostly Catholic, was reported to have shouted, &quot;Long live the King! Long live Christ! Death to bad government! Death to the heretic Lutheran [Viceroy Gelves]! Arrest the viceroy!&quot; The attack was specifically against Gelves, seen as a bad representative of the crown, rather than against the monarchy or colonial rule itself.

In 1642, there was a brief conspiracy to unite American-born Spaniards, blacks, Indians and castas against the Spanish crown and proclaim Mexican independence. The man seeking to bring about independence called himself Don Guillén Lampart y Guzmán, an Irishman with the birthname William Lamport. Lamport&#x27;s conspiracy was discovered, and he was arrested by the Inquisition in 1642 and executed fifteen years later for sedition. Today, there is a statue of Lamport in the mausoleum at the base of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City.

In 1692, there was a major riot in Mexico City, where a plebeian mob attempted to burn down the viceroy&#x27;s palace and the archbishop&#x27;s residence. A painting by Cristóbal de Villalpando shows the damage of the &quot;tumulto&quot;. Unlike the riot in 1624, in which elites were involved and the viceroy ousted with no repercussions against the instigators, the 1692 riot was instigated by plebeians alone and had an additional racial component. The rioters attacked key symbols of Spanish power and shouted political slogans, such as, &quot;Kill the [American-born] Spaniards and the &quot;Gachupines&quot; [Iberian-born Spaniards] who eat our corn! We go to war happily! God wants us to finish off the Spaniards! We do not care if we die without confession! Is this not our land?&quot; The viceroy attempted to address the cause of the riot, a hike in maize prices that affected the urban poor. But the 1692 riot &quot;represented class warfare that put Spanish authority at risk. Punishment was swift and brutal, and no further riots in the capital challenged the Pax Hispanica.&quot;

Food shortages almost a century later, due to a growing population and severe droughts, led to two food riots in 1785 and 1808. The first riot was more severe, but both culminated in violence and anger at officials of the colonial regime. However, there is no direct link between these riots and the independence movement of 1810, although the 1808–1809 food shortage may have been a contributory factor for popular resentment at the political regime.

Various indigenous rebellions in the colonial era occurred but were generally local in nature, attempting to redress perceived wrongs of immediate authorities rather than throw off crown rule more broadly. They were not a broad independence movement as such. However, during the War of Independence, issues at the local level in these rural areas were so widespread as to constitute what some historians have called &quot;the other rebellion&quot;.

Finally, before the events of 1808 upended the political situation in New Spain, there was an isolated and abortive 1799 event called the Conspiracy of the Machetes, perpetrated by a small group in Mexico City seeking independence.

== Age of Revolution, Spain and New Spain ==
In the early 19th century, the Age of Revolution was already underway when the 1808 Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian Peninsula destabilized not only Spain but also Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions. In 1776, the Anglo-American Thirteen Colonies and the American Revolution successfully gained their independence in 1783, with the help of both the Spanish Empire and Louis XVI&#x27;s French monarchy. Louis XVI was toppled in the French Revolution of 1789, with the aristocrats and the king himself losing his head in revolutionary violence. The rise of military strongman Napoleon Bonaparte brought some order within France, but the turmoil there set the stage for the black slave revolt in the French sugar colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) in 1791. The Haitian Revolution obliterated the slavocracy and gained independence for Haiti in 1804.

=== Political and economic instability ===
Tensions in New Spain were growing after the mid-eighteenth-century Bourbon reforms. With the reforms the crown sought to increase the power of the Spanish state, decrease the power of the Catholic church, rationalize and tighten control over the royal bureaucracy by placing peninsular-born officials rather than American-born, and increase revenues to the crown by a series of measures that undermined the economic position of American-born elites. The reforms were an attempt to revive the political and economic fortunes of the Spanish empire, but many historians see the reforms as accelerating the breakdown of its unity. This involved often removing large quantities of wealth that had been obtained in Mexico, before exporting to other parts of the empire to fund the many wars the Spanish were fighting.

The crown removed privileges (&quot;fuero eclesiástico&quot;) from ecclesiastics that had a disproportionate impact on American-born priests, who filled the ranks of the lower clergy in New Spain. A number of parish priests, most famously Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, subsequently became involved in the insurgency for independence. When the crown expelled the Jesuits from Spain and the overseas empire in 1767, it had a major impact on elites in New Spain, whose Jesuit sons were sent into exile, and cultural institutions, especially universities and colleges where they taught were affected. In New Spain there were riots in protest of their expulsion.

Colonial rule was not based on outright coercion, until the early nineteenth century, since the crown did not have sufficient personnel and firepower to enforce its rule. Rather, the crown&#x27;s hegemony and legitimacy to rule was accepted and ruled through institutions acting as mediators between competing groups, many organized as corporate entities. These were ecclesiastics, mining entrepreneurs, elite merchants, as well as indigenous communities. The crown&#x27;s creation of a standing military in the 1780s began to shift the political calculus since the crown could now use an armed force to impose rule. To aid building a standing military, the crown created set of corporate privileges (&quot;fuero&quot;) for the military. For the first time, mixed-race castas and blacks had access to corporate privileges, usually reserved for white elites.

Silver entrepreneurs and large-scale merchants also had access to special privileges. Lucrative overseas trade was in the hands of family firms based in Spain with ties to New Spain. Silver mining was the motor of the economy of New Spain, but also fueled the economies of Spain and the entire Atlantic world. That industry was in the hands of peninsula-born mine owners and their elite merchant investors. The crown imposed new regulations to boost their revenues from their overseas territories, particularly the consolidation of loans held by the Catholic Church. The 1804 Act of Consolidation called for borrowers to immediately repay the entire principal of the loan rather than stretch payments over decades. Borrowers were criollo land owners who could in no way repay large loans on short notice. The impact threatened the financial stability of elite Americans. The crown&#x27;s forced extraction of funds is considered by some a key factor in Creoles considering political independence.

=== Religious, racial, and cultural tensions ===
Within the Spanish Empire there was an unofficial yet apparent racial hierarchy which affected the social mobility of those not at the top of society. White, Spanish-born Peninsulares were at the top where many occupied the highest levels of government. This was followed by Mexican-born pure Spanish descendants, who also occupied most government positions, and Creoles. Below this were indigenous groups, African Mexicans and mixed race Mexicans. Many Creole elites deeply resented the lack of social mobility this brought as only Peninsular-born Spaniards could occupy the highest levels of government. This contributed to their reasoning behind backing the move for independence, to achieve power. They did not wish to overthrow the status quo entirely, as this would threaten their lucrative position in Mexican society. Instead, they wished to move up the social ladder, unable to under the unspoken racial hierarchy of the regime.

Religious tension is arguably one of the biggest contributions to tension before the French invasion of Spain in 1808. Many Creoles, Mexican Spaniards and the majority of indigenous, mixed and African groups in Mexico practiced Mexican Catholicism while the ruling Peninsulares preferred Modern Catholicism. Mexican or traditional Catholicism often worshiped through the use of relics, symbols and artifacts where they believe the Holy Spirit existed in the physical form of the artifact, and was a mix of traditional indigenous forms of worship and Catholicism. This contrasted with the view of modern Catholicism that many Peninsulares shared, where God was worshiped through divine artifacts and relics, but there was no religious presence within the physical artifact. Laws prohibiting Lay preachers, a major part of Mexican Catholicism, from preaching and restrictions on villagers to engage in processions around communal land to protect from unwanted spirits caused much outcry and prompted a multitude of legal battles between indigenous groups and the colonial regime through the separate indigenous courts. Not only this, but new laws essentially forcing indigenous groups to learn Spanish in schools and the taxation of Cofradias or Confraternities negatively affected the literacy and living standards in villages.

The ruling white Spanish elite and the majority of the country had very different views not only in culture and religion but on the role of government and social relations, with many elites viewing the government as a tool for progressing their own power, while indigenous groups saw the government as a communal vessel.

Leading up to the crisis in 1808 both Creole and Mexican-born Spaniards, and indigenous and mixed groups had come to dislike the colonial regime for different reasons.

== French invasion of Spain and political crisis in New Spain, 1808–1809 ==
The Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian Peninsula destabilized not only Spain but also Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions. The viceroy was the &quot;king&#x27;s living image&quot; in New Spain. In 1808 viceroy José de Iturrigaray (1803–1808) was in office when Napoleon&#x27;s forces invaded Iberia and deposed the Spanish monarch Charles IV and Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph was declared the monarch. This turn of events set off a crisis of legitimacy.  Viceroy Iturrigaray had been appointed by Charles IV, so his legitimacy to rule was not in doubt. In Mexico City, the city council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;), a stronghold of American-born Spaniards, began promoting ideas of autonomy for New Spain, and declaring New Spain to be on an equal basis to Spain.
Their proposal would have created a legitimate, representative, and autonomous government in New Spain, but not necessarily breaking from the Spanish Empire. Opposition to that proposal came from conservative elements, including the peninsular-born judges of the High Court (&quot;Audiencia&quot;), who voiced Peninsular interests. Iturrigaray attempted to find a compromise between the two factions, but failed. Upon hearing the news of the Napoleonic invasion some elites suspected that Iturrigaray intended to declare the viceroyalty a sovereign state and perhaps establish himself as head of a new state. With the support of the archbishop, Francisco Javier de Lizana y Beaumont, landowner Gabriel de Yermo, the merchant guild of Mexico City (&quot;consulado&quot;), and other members of elite society in the capital, Yermo led a coup d&#x27;état against the viceroy. They stormed the Viceregal Palace in Mexico City, the night of 15 September 1808, deposing the viceroy, and imprisoning him along with some American-born Spanish members of the city council.

The peninsular rebels installed Pedro de Garibay as viceroy. Since he was not a crown appointee, but rather the leader of a rebel faction, creoles viewed him as an illegitimate representative of the crown. The event radicalized both sides.  For creoles, it was clear that to gain power they needed to form conspiracies against Peninsular rule, and later they took up arms to achieve their goals. Garibay was of advanced years and held office for just a year, replaced by Archbishop Lizana y Beaumont, also holding office for about a year. There was a precedent for the archbishop serving as viceroy, and given that Garibay came to power by coup, the archbishop had more legitimacy as ruler. Francisco Javier Venegas was appointed viceroy and landed in Veracruz in August, reaching Mexico City 14 September 1810. The next day, Hidalgo issued his call to arms in Dolores.

Immediately after the Mexico City coup ousting Iturrigaray, juntas in Spain created the Supreme Central Junta of Spain and the Indies, on 25 September 1808 in Aranjuez. Its creation was a major step in the political development in the Spanish empire, once it became clear that there needed to be a central governing body rather than scattered juntas of particular regions. Joseph I of Spain had invited representatives from Spanish America to Bayonne, France for a constitutional convention to discuss their status in the new political order. It was a shrewd political move, but none accepted the invitation. However, it became clear to the Supreme Central Junta that keeping his overseas kingdoms loyal was imperative. Silver from New Spain was vital for funding the war against France. The body expanded to include membership from Spanish America, with the explicit recognition that they were kingdoms in their own right and not colonies of Spain. Elections were set to send delegates to Spain to participate in the Supreme Central Junta.

Although in the Spanish Empire there was not an ongoing tradition of high level representative government, found in Britain and British North America, towns in Spain and New Spain had elected representative ruling bodies, the &quot;cabildos&quot; or &quot;ayuntamientos&quot;, which came to play an important political role when the legitimate Spanish monarch was ousted in 1808. The successful 1809 elections in Mexico City for delegates to be sent to Spain had some precedents.

== The Hidalgo revolt, 1810–1811 ==
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla is now considered the father of Mexican independence. His uprising on 16 September 1810 is considered the spark igniting the Mexican War of Independence. He inspired tens of thousands of ordinary men to follow him, but did not organize them into a disciplined fighting force or have a broad military strategy, but he did want to destroy the old order. Fellow insurgent leader and second in command, Ignacio Allende, said of Hidalgo, &quot;Neither were his men amenable to discipline, nor was Hidalgo interested in regulations.&quot; Hidalgo issued a few important decrees in the later stage of the insurgency, but did not articulate a coherent set of goals much beyond his initial call to arms denouncing bad government. Only following Hidalgo&#x27;s death in 1811 under the leadership of his former seminary student, Father José María Morelos, was a document created that made explicit the goals of the insurgency, the &quot;Sentimientos de la Nación&quot; (&quot;Sentiments of the Nation&quot;) (1813). One clear point was political independence from Spain. Despite its having only a vague ideology, Hidalgo&#x27;s movement demonstrated the massive discontent and power of Mexico&#x27;s plebeians as an existential threat to the imperial regime. The government focused its resources on defeating Hidalgo&#x27;s insurgents militarily and in tracking down and publicly executing its leadership. But by then the insurgency had spread beyond its original region and leadership.

Hidalgo was a learned priest who knew multiple languages, had a significant library, and was friends with men who held Enlightenment views. He held the important position of rector of the Seminary of San Nicolás, but had run afoul of the Inquisition for unorthodox beliefs and speaking against the monarchy. He had already sired two daughters with Josefa Quintana. Following the death of his brother Joaquín in 1803, Hidalgo, who was having money problems due to debts on landed estates he owned, became curate of the poor parish of Dolores. He became member of a group of well-educated American-born Spaniards in Querétaro. They met under the guise of being a literary society, supported by the wife of crown official (&quot;corregidor&quot;) Miguel Domínguez, Josefa Ortíz de Domínguez, known now as &quot;La Corregidora&quot;. Instead the members discussed the possibility of a popular rising, similar to one that already had recently been quashed in Valladolid (now Morelia) in 1809 in the name of Ferdinand VII.

Hidalgo was friends with Ignacio Allende, a captain in the regiment of Dragoons in New Spain, who was also among the conspirators. The &quot;Conspiracy of Querétaro&quot; began forming cells in other Spanish cities in the north, including Celaya, Guanajuato, San Miguel el Grande, now named after Allende. Allende had served in a royal regiment during the rule of José de Iturrigaray, who was overthrown in 1808 by peninsular Spaniards who considered him too sympathetic to the grievances of American-born Spaniards. With the ouster of the viceroy, Allende turned against the new regime and was open to the conspiracy for independence. Hidalgo joined the conspiracy, and with Allende vouching for him rose to being one of its leaders. Word of the conspiracy got to crown officials, and the corregidor Domínguez cracked down, but his wife Josefa was able to warn Allende who then alerted Hidalgo. At this point there was no firm ideology or action plan, but the tip-off galvanized Hidalgo to action. On Sunday, 16 September 1810 with his parishioners gathered for mass, Hidalgo issued his call to arms, the &quot;Grito de Dolores&quot;. It is unclear what Hidalgo actually said, since there are different accounts. The one which became part of the official record of accusation against Hidalgo was &quot;Long live religion! Long live Our Most Holy Mother of Guadalupe! Long live Fernando VII! Long live America and down with bad government!&quot;
From a small gathering at the Dolores church, others joined the uprising including workers on local landed estates, prisoners liberated from jail, and a few members of a royal army regiment. Many estate workers&#x27; weapons were agricultural tools now to be used against the regime. Some were mounted and acted as a cavalry under the direction of their estate foremen. Others were poorly armed Indians with bows and arrows. The numbers joining the revolt rapidly swelled under Hidalgo&#x27;s leadership, they began moving beyond the village of Dolores. Despite rising tensions following the events of 1808, the royal regime was largely unprepared for the suddenness, size, and violence of the movement.

The religious character of the movement was present from the beginning, embodied in leadership of the priest, Hidalgo. The movement&#x27;s banner with image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, seized by Hidalgo from the church at Atotonilco, was symbolically important. The &quot;dark virgin&quot; was seen as a protector of dark-skinned Mexicans, and now seen as well as a liberator. Many men in Hidalgo&#x27;s forces put the image of Guadalupe on their hats. Supporters of the imperial regime took as their patron the Virgin of Remedios, so that religious symbolism was used by both insurgents and royalists. There were a number of parish priests and other lower clergy in the insurgency, most prominently Hidalgo and José María Morelos, but the Church hierarchy was flatly opposed. Insurgents were excommunicated by the clergy and clerics preached sermons against the insurgency.

They were not organized in any formal fashion, more of a mass movement than an army. Hidalgo inspired his followers, but did not organize or train them as a fighting force, nor impose order and discipline on them. A few militia men in uniform joined Hidalgo&#x27;s movement and attempted to create some military order and discipline, but they were few in number. The bulk of the royal army remained loyal to the imperial regime, but Hidalgo&#x27;s rising had caught them unprepared and their response was delayed. Hidalgo&#x27;s early victories gave the movement momentum, but &quot;the lack of weapons, trained soldiers, and good officers meant that except in unusual circumstances the rebels could not field armies capable of fighting conventional battles against the royalists.&quot;

The growing insurgent force marched through towns including San Miguel el Grande and Celaya, where they met little resistance, and gained more followers. When they reached the town of Guanajuato on 28 September, they found Spanish forces barricaded inside the public granary, Alhóndiga de Granaditas. Among them were some &#x27;forced&#x27; Royalists, creoles who had served and sided with the Spanish. By this time, the rebels numbered 30,000 and the battle was horrific. They killed more than 500 European and American Spaniards, and marched on toward Mexico City.

The new viceroy quickly organized a defense, sending out the Spanish general Torcuato Trujillo with 1,000 men, 400 horsemen, and two cannons—all that could be found on such short notice. The crown had established a standing military in the late eighteenth century, granting non-Spaniards who served the &quot;fuero militar&quot;, the only special privileges for mixed-race men were eligible. Indians were excluded from the military. Royal army troops of the professional army were supplemented by local militias. The regime was determined to crush the uprising and attempted to stifle malcontents who might be drawn to the insurgency.

Ignacio López Rayón joined Hidalgo&#x27;s forces whilst passing near Maravatío, Michoacan while en route to Mexico City and on 30 October, Hidalgo&#x27;s army encountered Spanish military resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. As the Hidalgo and his forces surrounded Mexico City, a group of 2,500 royalist women joined under Ana Iraeta de Mier, to create and distribute pamphlets based on their loyalty towards Spain and help fellow loyalist families. Hidalgo&#x27;s forces continued to fight and achieved victory. When the cannons were captured by the rebels, the surviving Royalists retreated to the city.
Despite apparently having the advantage, Hidalgo retreated, against the counsel of Allende. This retreat, on the verge of apparent victory, has puzzled historians and biographers ever since. They generally believe that Hidalgo wanted to spare the numerous Mexican citizens in Mexico City from the inevitable sacking and plunder that would have ensued. His retreat is considered Hidalgo&#x27;s greatest tactical error and his failure to act &quot;was the beginning of his downfall.&quot; Hidalgo moved west and set up headquarters in Guadalajara, where one of the worst incidents of violence against Spanish civilians occurred, a month of massacres from 12 December 1810 (the Feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe) to 13 January 1811. At his trial following his capture later that year, Hidalgo admitted to ordering the murders. None &quot;were given a trial, nor was there any reason to do so, since he knew perfectly well they were innocent.&quot; In Guadalajara, the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe suddenly disappeared from insurgents&#x27; hats and there were many desertions.

The royalist forces, led by Félix María Calleja del Rey, were becoming more effective against disorganized and poorly armed of Hidalgo, defeating them at a bridge on the Calderón River, forcing the rebels to flee north towards the United States, perhaps hoping they would attain financial and military support. They were intercepted by Ignacio Elizondo, who pretended to join the fleeing insurgent forces. Hidalgo and his remaining soldiers were captured in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of Baján (&quot;Norias de Baján&quot;). When the insurgents adopted the tactics of guerrilla warfare and operated where it was effective, such as in the hot country of southern Mexico, they were able to undermine the royalist army. Around Guanajuato, regional insurgent leader for a time successfully combined insurgency with banditry. With the capture of Hidalgo and the creole leadership in the north, this phase of the insurgency was at an end.

The captured rebel leaders were found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, except for Mariano Abasolo, who was sent to Spain to serve a life sentence in prison. Allende, Jiménez, and Aldama were executed on 26 June 1811, shot in the back as a sign of dishonor. Hidalgo, as a priest, had to undergo a civil trial and review by the Inquisition. He was eventually stripped of his priesthood, found guilty, and executed on 30 July 1811. The heads of Hidalgo, Allende, Aldama, and Jiménez were preserved and hung from the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas of Guanajuato as a grim warning to those who dared follow in their footsteps.

== Insurgency in the South under Morelos, 1811–1815 ==
Warfare in the northern Bajío region waned after the capture and execution of the insurgency&#x27;s creole leadership, but the insurgency had already spread to other more southern regions, to the towns of Zitácuaro, Cuautla, Antequera (now Oaxaca) towns where a new leadership had emerged. Priests José María Morelos and Mariano Matamoros, as well as Vicente Guerrero, Guadalupe Victoria, and Ignacio López Rayón carried on the insurgency on a different basis, organizing their forces, using guerrilla tactics, and importantly for the insurgency, creating organizations and creating written documents that articulated the insurgents&#x27; goals.

Following the execution of Hidalgo and other insurgents, leadership of the remaining insurgent movement initially coalesced under Ignacio López Rayón, a civilian lawyer and businessman. He had been stationed in Saltillo, Coahuila with 3,500 men and 22 cannons. When he heard of the capture of the insurgent leaders, he fled south on 26 March 1811 to continue the fight. He subsequently fought the Spanish in the battles of Puerto de Piñones, Zacatecas, El Maguey, and Zitácuaro.In an important step, Rayón organized the &quot;Suprema Junta Gubernativa de América&quot; (Supreme National Governing Junta of America), which claimed legitimacy to lead the insurgency. Rayón articulated &quot;Elementos constitucionales&quot;, which states that &quot;Sovereignty arises directly from the people, resides in the person of Ferdinand VII, and is exercised by the &quot;Suprema Junta Gubernativa de América&quot;. The Supreme Junta generated a flood of detailed regulations and orders. On the ground, Father José María Morelos pursued successful military engagements, accepting the authority of the Supreme Junta. After winning victories and taking the port of Acapulco, then the towns Tixtla, Izúcar, and Taxco, Morelos was besieged for 72 days by royalist troops under Calleja at Cuautla. The Junta failed to send aid to Morelos. Morelos&#x27;s troops held out and broke out of the siege, going on to take Antequera, (now Oaxaca). The relationship between Morelos and the Junta soured, with Morelos complaining, &quot;Your disagreements have been of service to the enemy.&quot;

Morelos was a real contrast to Hidalgo, although both were rebel priests. Both had sympathy for Mexico&#x27;s downtrodden, but Morelos was of mixed-race while Hidalgo was an American-born Spaniard, so Morelos experientially understood racial discrimination in the colonial order. On more practical grounds, Morelos built an organized and disciplined military force, while Hidalgo&#x27;s followers lacked arms, training, or discipline, an effective force that the royal army took seriously. Potentially Morelos could have taken the colony&#x27;s second largest city, Puebla de los Angeles, situated halfway between the port of Veracruz and the capital, Mexico City. To avert that strategic disaster, which would have left the capital cut off from its main port, viceroy Venegas transferred Calleja from the Bajío to deal with Morelos&#x27;s forces. Morelos&#x27;s forces moved south and took Oaxaca, allowing him to control most of the southern region. During this period, the insurgency had reason for optimism and formulated documents declaring independence and articulating a vision for a sovereign Mexico.Morelos was not ambitious to become leader of the insurgency, but it was clear that he was recognized by insurgents as its supreme military commander. He moved swiftly and decisively, stripping Rayón of power, dissolving the Supreme Junta, and in 1813, Morelos convened the Congress of Chilpancingo, also known as the Congress of Anáhuac. The congress brought together representatives of the insurgency together. Morelos formulated his Sentiments of the Nation, addressed to the congress. In point 1, he clearly and flatly states that &quot;America is free and independent of Spain.&quot;On 6 November of that year, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America. In addition to declaring independence from Spain, the Morelos called for the establishment of Catholicism as the only religion (but with certain restrictions), the abolition of slavery and racial distinctions between and of all other nations,&quot; going on in point 5 to say, &quot;sovereignty springs directly from the People.&quot; His second point makes the &quot;Catholic Religion&quot; the only one permissible, and that &quot;Catholic dogma shall be sustained by the Church hierarchy&quot; (point 4). The importance of Catholicism is further emphasized to mandate December 12, the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe, as a day to honor her. A provision of key importance to dark-skinned plebeians (point 15) is &quot;That slavery is proscribed forever, as well as the distinctions of caste [race], so that all shall be equal; and that the only distinction between one American and another shall be that between vice and virtue.&quot;. Also important for Morelos&#x27;s vision of the new nation was equality before the law (point 13), rather than maintaining special courts and privileges (fueros) to particular groups, such as churchmen, miners, merchants, and the military.The Congress elected Morelos as the head of the executive branch of government, as well as supreme commander of the insurgency, coordinating its far-flung components. The formal statement by the Congress of Chilpancingo, the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence, is an important formal document in Mexican history, since it declares Mexico an independent nation and lays out its powers as a sovereign state to make war and peace, to appoint ambassadors, and to have standing with the Papacy, rather than indirectly through the Spanish monarch. The document enshrines Roman Catholicism the sole religion.

Calleja restructured the royal army in an attempt to crush the insurgency, creating commands in Puebla, Valladolid (now Morelia), Guanajuato, and Nueva Galicia, with experienced peninsular military officers to lead them. American-born officer Agustín de Iturbide was part of this royalist leadership. Brigadier Ciriaco de Llano captured and executed Mariano Matamoros, an effective insurgent. After the dissolution of the Congress of Chilpancingo, Morelos was captured 5 November 1815, interrogated, was tried and executed by firing squad. With his death, conventional warfare ended and guerrilla warfare continued uninterrupted.

== Insurgency under Vicente Guerrero, 1815–1820 ==
With the execution of Morelos in 1815, Vicente Guerrero emerged as the most important leader of the insurgency. From 1815 to 1821, most of the fighting for independence from Spain was by guerrilla forces in the &quot;tierra caliente&quot; (hot country) of southern Mexico and to a certain extent in northern New Spain. In 1816, Francisco Javier Mina, a Spanish military leader who had fought against Ferdinand VII, joined the independence movement. Mina and 300 men landed at &quot;Rio Santander&quot; (Tamaulipas) in April, in 1817 and fought for seven months until his capture by royalist forces in November 1817.

Two insurgent leaders arose: Guadalupe Victoria (born José Miguel Fernández y Félix) in Puebla and Vicente Guerrero in the village of Tixla, in what is now the state of Guerrero. Both gained allegiance and respect from their followers. Believing the situation under control, the Spanish viceroy issued a general pardon to every rebel who would lay down his arms. Many did lay down their arms and received pardons, but when the opportunity arose, they often returned to the insurgency. The royal army controlled the major cities and towns, but whole swaths of the countryside were not pacified. From 1816 to 1820, the insurgency was stalemated, but not stamped out. Royalist military officer, Antonio López de Santa Anna led amnestied former insurgents, pursuing insurgent leader Guadalupe Victoria. Insurgents attacked key roads, vital for commerce and imperial control, such that the crown sent a commander from Peru, Brigadier Fernando Miyares y Mancebo, to build a fortified road between the port of Veracruz and Jalapa, the first major stopping point on the way to Mexico City. The rebels faced stiff Spanish military resistance and the apathy of many of the most influential criollos.The period 1816–1820 is often considered a period of military stalemate, unable to delivery a knockout blow. Insurgents often settled into guerrilla warfare with some banditry, while royalist forces became increasingly demoralized. Spain sent insufficient reinforcements, although a number of senior officers arrived. By 1814, the Peninsular War against Napoleon was won and Ferdinand VII became the monarch, initially as a constitutional ruler under the Spanish constitution of 1812, but once in power, reneged on promises to have constitutional limits on his power. Crown resources did not go toward funding the war against the insurgents, so that many expeditionary soldiers were not paid and left to their own devices in territory largely controlled by insurgents. Rather than risk life and limb fighting insurgents, they avoided risky operations and stayed close to fortified garrisons. Since money to pay and supply soldiers was not forthcoming from the crown, royal forces pressed local populations for supplies. As for high officers, many saw the hopelessness of the situation and decided to make the best of it by creating what one historian has called &quot;veritable satrapies&quot;, becoming wealthy from confiscated insurgent properties, and taxing local merchants.

In what was supposed to be the final government campaign against the insurgents, in December 1820, Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist Colonel Agustín de Iturbide, to defeat Guerrero&#x27;s army in Oaxaca. Iturbide, a native of Valladolid (now Morelia), had gained renown for his zeal against Hidalgo&#x27;s and Morelos&#x27;s rebels during the early independence struggle. A favorite of the Mexican church hierarchy, Iturbide symbolized conservative creole values; he was devoutly religious and committed to the defense of property rights and social privileges. He also resented his lack of promotion and failure to gain wealth.

== Guerrero, Iturbide, and the Plan of Iguala ==
Iturbide&#x27;s assignment to the Oaxaca expedition in 1820 coincided with a successful military coup in Spain against the monarchy of Ferdinand VII. The coup leaders, part of an expeditionary force assembled to suppress the independence movements in the Americas, had turned against the autocratic monarchy. They compelled the reluctant Ferdinand to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 that created a constitutional monarchy. When news of the liberal charter reached New Spain, Iturbide perceived it both as a threat to the status quo and a catalyst to rouse the creole elites to gain control of Mexico. Independence was achieved when conservative Royalist forces in the colonies chose to rise up against the liberal regime in Spain; it was an about-face compared to their previous opposition to the peasant insurgency.The royalist army was demoralized and the insurgents were unable to oust them. With the re-imposition of the Spanish Constitution, the relationship between newly elected town councils (&quot;ayuntamientos&quot;) and the military meant that councils could put limits on taxation and many voted to cease exacting taxes to support the royalist army. Commanders lost their financial support and could no longer compel men to join militias. Militias were demobilized and men who had served outside of their native areas went home. The insurgents no longer felt the continuous pressure of the royalist military. Militia men abandoned areas where insurgents were active.

With the situation changed in part because of the Spanish Constitution, Guerrero realized that creole elites might move toward independence and exclude the insurgents. For that reason, his reaching an accommodation with the royalist army became a pragmatic move. From the royalist point of view, forging an alliance with their former foes created a way forward to independence. If creoles had declared independence for their own political purposes without coming to terms with the insurgency in the south, then an independent Mexico would have to contend with rebels who could threaten a new nation. Iturbide initiated contact with Guerrero in January 1821, indicating he was weighing whether to abandon the royalist cause. Guerrero was receptive to listening to Iturbide&#x27;s vague proposal, but was not going to commit without further clarification. Iturbide replied to Guerrero&#x27;s demand for clarity, saying that he had a plan for a constitution, one apparently based on the 1812 Spanish liberal constitution. Guerrero responded that the failure of that constitution to address the grievances of many in New Spain, and particularly objected to that constitution&#x27;s exclusion of Afro-Mexicans from citizenship, while according it to European whites, Indians, and mestizos.

The question of equality for all races was a key matter for Guerrero and other insurgents, many of whom had African ancestry. Iturbide accepted that important change. The two men negotiated about how the merging of the old insurgent forces and the former royalist army would occur. Iturbide wrote the final draft of the Plan of Iguala, named for the place where it was proclaimed on 24 February 1821. Iturbide proclaimed three principles, or &quot;guarantees&quot;, for Mexican independence from Spain. Mexico would be an independent monarchy governed by King Ferdinand, another Bourbon prince or some other conservative European prince; creoles would be given equal rights and privileges to &quot;peninsulares&quot;; and the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico would retain its privileges and position as the established religion of the land.

To reach an accord that both sides would accept, the plan explicitly laid out the terms of equality. For people of mixed race, point 12 made explicit &quot;All inhabitants of New Spain, without distinction to their being Europeans, Africans, or Indians, are citizens of this Monarchy with the option to seek all employment according to their merits and virtues.&quot; For European whites, their privileged place in Mexico was to be maintained, guaranteeing their place in existing positions in government. &quot;All branches of the government service will remain without alteration, and that all those presently employed in politics, the church, civilian business, or the military will retain the same positions held at present.&quot; Racial designations of Mexicans and distinctions between creole and peninsular Spaniards were abolished.

After convincing his troops to accept the Plan of Iguala, Iturbide persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of this conservative independence movement. A new army, the Army of the Three Guarantees, was placed under Iturbide&#x27;s command to enforce the plan. The plan was so broadly based that it appealed both patriots and loyalists. The goal of independence and the protection of Roman Catholicism brought together most factions. To symbolize these three guarantees of unity, religion, and independence, Iturbide adopted a green, white, and red flag; these colors are still used in the modern Mexican flag.

Although the alliance of Iturbide and Guerrero resulted in the Plan of Iguala, there was not universal acclaim of the accord. A number of important insurgents, including Juan Álvarez, and rejected it. Guzmán articulated his objection to the plan, saying that it guaranteed the privileges of the elites, welcomed opportunists who supported independence late in the struggle, and cast doubt on the clause that was to guarantee racial equality. He focused on the final words that guaranteed rights &quot;according to their merits and virtues&quot;. Álvarez, Ascencio and Guzmán declined to join the Army of the Three Guarantees, the military force created by Iturbide and Guerrero, but did continue to fight the royalists.

== Collapse of imperial rule and independence ==
Iturbide persuaded royalist officers to change sides and support independence as well as the mixed race old insurgent forces. For some royalist commanders, their forces simply left, some of them amnestied former insurgents. The high military command in Mexico City deposed the viceroy, Juan Ruiz de Apodaca in July 1821, replacing him with an interim viceroy, royalist general Francisco Novella. By the time that Juan O&#x27;Donojú became the new viceroy, practically the whole country supported the Plan of Iguala. Most soldiers had defected to Iturbide&#x27;s Army of the Three Guarantees and the Spanish cause was lost. On 24 August 1821, representatives of the Spanish crown, including the new viceroy Juan O&#x27;Donojú and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which recognized Mexican independence under the Plan of Iguala. O&#x27;Donojú then resigned as viceroy. The Spanish government denied that O&#x27;Donojú had the authority to sign the treaty, but events on the ground saw Iturbide and the Army of Three Guarantees march into Mexico City in triumph on 27 September 1821. The next day, the Mexican independence was proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire. The Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba had rapidly brought about an alliance of insurgents and former royalists turned autonomists resulting in the rapid achievement of independence virtually without further military conflict. Once independence was achieved, the fissures between different interests rapidly re-emerged.

== Creation of the First Mexican Empire ==
On 27 September 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City, and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire, as New Spain was henceforth to be called. The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes. Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown. Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide&#x27;s followers.

On the night of 18 May 1822, a mass demonstration led by the Regiment of Celaya, which Iturbide had commanded during the war, marched through the streets and demanded their commander-in-chief to accept the throne. The following day, the Congress declared Iturbide Emperor of Mexico. On 31 October 1822, Iturbide dissolved Congress and replaced it with a sympathetic junta.

== Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico ==
Despite the creation of the Mexican nation, the Spanish still managed to retain control of San Juan de Ulúa, a fortress complex overlooking the port of Veracruz, until it surrendered to Mexican forces on 23 November 1825. Spanish attempts to re-establish control over Mexico culminated in the 1829 Battle of Tampico, during which a Spanish invasion force was surrounded in Tampico and forced to surrender.

On 28 December 1836, Spain recognized the independence of Mexico under the Santa María–Calatrava Treaty, signed in Madrid by the Mexican Commissioner Miguel Santa María and the Spanish state minister José María Calatrava. Mexico was the first former colony whose independence was recognized by Spain; the second was Ecuador on 16 February 1840.

== Legacy ==

In 1910, as part of the celebrations marking the centennial of the Hidalgo revolt of 1810, President Porfirio Díaz inaugurated the monument to Mexico&#x27;s political separation from Spain, the Angel of Independence on Avenida Reforma. The creation of this architectural monument is part of the long process of the construction of historical memory of Mexican independence.

Although Mexico gained its independence in September 1821, the marking of this historical event did not take hold immediately. The choice of date to celebrate was problematic, because Iturbide, who achieved independence from Spain, was rapidly created Emperor of Mexico. His short-lived rule from 1821 to 1823 ended when he was forced by the military to abdicate. This was a rocky start for the new nation, which made celebrating independence on the anniversary of Iturbide&#x27;s Army of the Three Guarantees marching into Mexico City in triumph a less than perfect day for those who had opposed him. Celebrations of independence during his reign were marked on 27 September. Following his ouster, there were calls to commemorate Mexican independence along the lines that the United States celebrated in grand style its Independence Day on 4 July. The creation of a committee of powerful men to mark independence celebrations, the &quot;Junta Patriótica&quot;, organized celebrations of both 16 September, to commemorate Hidalgo&#x27;s grito and the start of the independence insurgency, and 27 September, to celebrate actual political independence.

During the Díaz regime (1876–1911), the president&#x27;s birthday coincided with the 15/16 September celebration of independence. The largest celebrations took place and continue to do so in the capital&#x27;s main square, the zócalo, with the pealing of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City&#x27;s bells. In the 1880s, government officials attempted to move the bell that Hidalgo rang in 1810 to gather parishioners in Dolores for what became his famous &quot;grito&quot;. Initially the pueblo&#x27;s officials said the bell no longer existed, but in 1896, the bell, known as the Bell of San José, was taken to the capital. It was renamed the &quot;Bell of Independence&quot; and ritually rung by Díaz. It is now an integral part of Independence Day festivities.

Plans were drawn up for the commemoration of independence in 2021, as well as the establishment of the Mexican republic in 2024. The 2021 event was termed the &quot;Consummation of Independence&quot;.

<doc id="785595" wikidata="Q953879" url="?curid=785595" title="Human rights in Russia">
<text>Russia has consistently been criticized by international organizations and independent domestic media outlets for human rights violations. Some of the most commonly cited violations include deaths in custody, the systemic and widespread use of torture by security forces and prison guards, the existence of hazing rituals within the Russian Army—referred to as &quot;dedovshchina&quot; (&#x27;reign of grandfathers&#x27;)—as well as prevalent breaches of children&#x27;s rights, instances of violence and prejudice against ethnic minorities, and the targeted killings of journalists.

As the successor state to the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation is beholden to the same human rights agreements that were signed and ratified by its predecessor, such as the international covenants on civil and political rights as well as economic, social, and cultural rights. In the late 1990s, Russia also ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (with reservations), and from 1998 onwards the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg became a last court of appeal for Russian citizens from their national system of justice. According to Chapter 1, Article 15 of the 1993 Constitution, these embodiments of international law take precedence over national federal legislation.

As a former member of the Council of Europe and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, Russia carried international obligations related to the issue of human rights. In the introduction to the 2004 report on the situation in Russia, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe noted the &quot;sweeping changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union undeniable&quot;.

However, starting from Vladimir Putin&#x27;s second presidential term (2004–2008), there were increasing reports of human rights violations. Following the 2011 State Duma elections and Putin&#x27;s subsequent return to the presidency in spring 2012, there has been a legislative onslaught on many international and constitutional rights, e.g. Article 20 (Freedom of Assembly and Association) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is embodied in Articles 30 and 31 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation (1993). In December 2015, a law was enacted that empowers the Constitutional Court of Russia to determine the enforceability or disregard of resolutions from intergovernmental bodies, such as the European Court of Human Rights. As of 16 March 2022, Russia is no longer a member state of the Council of Europe.

==Background==
Human rights were severely restricted within the Soviet Union. From 1927 to 1953, it was ruled as a totalitarian regime, and until 1990, it was also ruled as a single-party state. The government commonly silenced freedom of speech and it also used harsh measures against all dissenters. No independent political organizations, including labor unions, private businesses, churches, and opposing political parties, were tolerated. Citizens&#x27; movement was strictly controlled both within the country and internationally, and private property rights were heavily limited.

In practice, the Soviet government significantly curtailed many of the principles of the rule of law, civil liberties, legal protections, and property rights, considering them representative of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot;, according to the Soviet legal thinker Andrey Vyshinsky. Despite officially signing human rights agreements, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973, these documents were mostly unknown and unavailable to people living under Communist rule. Furthermore, the Communist authorities showed little respect for these commitments. Human rights activists in the Soviet Union consistently faced harassment, suppression, and arrest.

==The Putin presidency==

===Ratings===
During Putin&#x27;s first term as President (2000–2004), Freedom House rated Russia as &quot;partially free&quot; with poor scores of 4 on both political rights and civil liberties (1 being most free, and 7 least free). In the period from 2005 to 2008, Freedom House rated Russia as &quot;not free&quot; with scores of 6 for political rights and 5 for civil liberties according to its Freedom in the World reports.

In 2006, &quot;The Economist&quot; published a democracy rating, which placed Russia at 102nd among 167 countries and defined it as a &quot;hybrid regime with a trend towards curtailment of media and other civil liberties&quot;.

According to the Human Rights Watch 2016 report, the human rights situation in the Russian Federation continues to deteriorate.

By 2016, four years into Putin&#x27;s third term as president, the Russian Federation had sunk further on the Freedom House rating:

[T]he Kremlin continued a crackdown on civil society, ramping up pressure on domestic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and branding the U.S.-based National Endowment for Democracy and two groups backed by billionaire philanthropist George Soros as &#x27;undesirable organizations&#x27;. The regime also intensified its tight grip on the media, saturating the information landscape with nationalist propaganda while suppressing the most popular alternative voices.

Reportedly in 2019, with France and Germany’s constant efforts in saving Moscow from being expelled from the Europe&#x27;s human rights watchdog, Russia might retain its seat if it resumes its membership fees payment.

===Overview of issues===
International monitors and domestic observers have listed numerous, often deeply-rooted problems in the country and, with their advocacy, citizens have directed a flood of complaints to the European Court of Human Rights since 1998. By 1 June 2007, 22.5% of its pending cases were complaints against the Russian Federation by its citizens. This proportion had risen steadily since 2002 as in 2006 there were 151 admissible applications against Russia (out of 1,634 for all the countries) while in 2005 it was 110 (of 1,036), in 2004 it was 64 (of 830), in 2003 it was 15 (of 753) and in 2002 it was 12 (of 578).

Chechnya posed a separate problem and during the Second Chechen War, which lasted from September 1999 to 2005, there were numerous instances of summary execution and forced disappearance of civilians there. According to the ombudsman of the Chechen Republic, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, the most complex and painful problem as of March 2007 was to trace over 2,700 abducted and forcefully held citizens; analysis of the complaints of citizens of Chechnya shows that social problems were ever more frequently coming to the foreground; two years earlier, he said, complaints mostly concerned violations of the right to life.

====NGOs====
The Federal Law of 10 January 2006 changed the rules affecting registration and operation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Russia. The Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, among others, was closed. A detailed report by Olga Gnezdilova demonstrated that small, genuinely volunteer organisations were disproportionately hit by the demands of the new procedures: for the time being, larger NGOs with substantial funding were not affected.

Following Putin&#x27;s re-election in May 2012 for a third term as president, a new Federal Law was passed, requiring all NGOs in receipt of foreign funding and &quot;engaged in political activities&quot; to register as &quot;foreign agents&quot; with the RF Ministry of Justice. By September 2016 144 NGOs were listed on the Register, including many of the oldest, most well-known and respected organisations, both internationally and domestically. Government can brand NGOs as &quot;undesirable&quot; to fine and shut them down. Members of &quot;undesirable organisations&quot; can be fined and imprisoned.

====Assassinations====

The deepest concern was reserved for the periodic unsolved assassinations of leading opposition politicians, lawmakers, journalists, and critics of the government, at home and sometimes abroad. According to a BuzzFeed News report in 2017, current and former US and UK intelligence agents told the outlet that they believe that Russian assassins, possibly on government orders, could be linked to 14 deaths on British soil that were dismissed as not suspicious by police.

In 1998, human rights advocate Galina Starovoitova was shot dead in St. Petersburg at the entrance of her apartment. In 2003, Yuri Schekochikhin mysteriously died from illness, causing speculation into his death, such as poisoning. In 2003, the liberal politician Sergei Yushenkov was shot dead. In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium and died. A British inquiry concluded that President Putin had &quot;probably&quot; approved his murder. In 2006, investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead. In 2009, human rights advocate Stanislav Markelov and journalist Anastasia Baburova were shot dead in Moscow. In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead near the Kremlin. In 2017, journalist Nikolay Andrushchenko was beaten to death.

====Political prisoners====
The numbers reliably considered to be political prisoners have risen sharply in the last four years. In May 2016, the Memorial Human Rights Centre put the total at 89. By May 2017, Memorial considered there were at least 117 political prisoners or prisoners of conscience (66 accused of belonging to the Muslim organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami which has been banned in Russia since 2010). Among these prisoners is also human rights defender Emir-Usein Kuku from Crimea who was accused of belonging to Hizb ut-Tahrir although he denies any involvement in this organization. Amnesty International has called for his immediate liberation.

At various times those imprisoned have included human rights defenders, journalists such as Mikhail Trepashkin, and scientists such as Valentin Danilov. Since 2007, loosely-worded laws against &quot;extremism&quot; or &quot;terrorism&quot; have been used to incarcerate the often youthful activists who have protested in support of freedom of assembly, against the alleged mass falsification of elections in 2011 and, since 2014, against the occupation of Crimea, the conflict in eastern Ukraine and corruption in the highest echelons of the government and State. Political prisoners are often subjected to torture in prisons and penal colonies.

On 10 May 2014, Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov was arrested in Simferopol, Crimea. He was taken to Russia, where he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for alleged terrorist activities. Amnesty International considered the trial unfair and called for the release of Sentsov. Human Rights Watch described the trial as a political show trial calling for the liberation of the filmmaker. On 7 September 2019 Sentsov was released in a prisoner swap.

In May 2018 Server Mustafayev, the founder and coordinator of the human rights movement Crimean Solidarity was imprisoned by Russian authorities and charged with &quot;membership of a terrorist organisation&quot;. Amnesty International and Front Line Defenders demand his immediate release.

There were cases of attacks on demonstrators organized by local authorities.

With the passing of time some of these prisoners have been released or, like Igor Sutyagin, exchanged with other countries for Russian agents held abroad. Nevertheless, the numbers continue to mount. According to some organisations there are now more than 300 individuals who have either been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in Russia, or are currently detained awaiting trial (in custody or under home arrest), or have fled abroad or gone into hiding, because of persecution for their beliefs and their attempts to exercise their rights under the Russian Constitution and international agreements.

In April 2019, an Israeli citizen who carried 9.6 grams of hashish was detained in Russia and sentenced to more than seven years in prison in October 2019. This sentence had political reasons. She was pardoned in January 2020.

On 22 June 2020, Human Rights Organization along with Amnesty International wrote a joint-letter to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, Igor Viktorovich Krasnov. In their letter, they asked for the release of six human rights defender who were convicted and sentenced in November 2019 to prison terms ranging from seven to 19 years on groundless terror-related charges.

On 17 January 2021, Amnesty International declared Alexei Navalny to be a prisoner of conscience following his detention after returning to Russia and called on the Russian authorities to release him.

 per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political prisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or indirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245 prosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that are banned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e. more than 20% of the total, are residents of Crimea.

Russia has been accused of hostage diplomacy and has exchanged prisoners with the United States.

On 4 March 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who publish &quot;knowingly false information&quot; about the Russian armed forces and their operations, leading to some media outlets in Russia to stop reporting on Ukraine or shutting their media outlet. As of December 2022, more than 4,000 people were prosecuted under &quot;fake news&quot; laws in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In early 2024, Ksenia Karelina was arrested in Yekaterinburg and charged with treason by the Russian government for sending $51.80 to Razom, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that sends humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Her trial began on June 20, 2024 and she admitted guilt on August 7. On August 15, 2024, she was sentenced by the regional courts of Sverdlovsk and Yekaterinburg to 12 years in prison.

On 17 January 2025, three lawyers—Igor Sergunin, Alexei Lipster, and Vadim Kabez—from the opposition party of Alexei Navalny were found guilty by a Russian court and sentenced to a total of five years in prison. They were accused of helping Navalny execute illegal activities outside jail.

==Judicial system==
The judiciary of Russia is subject to manipulation by political authorities according to Amnesty International. According to Constitution of Russia, top judges are appointed by the Federation Council, following nomination by the President of Russia. Anna Politkovskaya described in her book &quot;Putin&#x27;s Russia&quot; stories of judges who did not follow &quot;orders from the above&quot; and were assaulted or removed from their positions. In an open letter written in 2005, former judge Olga Kudeshkina criticized the chairman of the Moscow city court O. Egorova for &quot;&quot;recommending&quot; judges to make &quot;right&quot; decisions&quot;, which allegedly caused more than 80 judges in Moscow to retire in the period from 2002 to 2005.

In the 1990s, Russia&#x27;s prison system was widely reported by media and human rights groups as troubled. There were large case backlogs and trial delays, resulting in lengthy pre-trial detention. Prison conditions were viewed as well below international standards. Tuberculosis was a serious, pervasive problem. Human rights groups estimated that about 11,000 inmates and prison detainees die annually, most because of overcrowding, disease, and lack of medical care. A media report dated 2006 points to a campaign of prison reform that has resulted in apparent improvements in conditions. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation has been working to reform Russia&#x27;s prisons since 1997, in concert with reform efforts by the national government.

The rule of law has made very limited inroads in the criminal justice since the Soviet time, especially in the deep provinces.
The courts generally follow the non-acquittals policy; in 2004 acquittals constituted only 0.7 percent of all judgments. Judges are dependent on administrators, bidding prosecutorial offices in turn. The work of public prosecutors varies from poor to dismal. Lawyers are mostly court appointed and low paid. There was a rapid deterioration of the situation characterized by abuse of the criminal process, harassment and persecution of defense bar members in politically sensitive cases in recent years. The principles of adversariness and equality of the parties to criminal proceedings are not observed.

In 1996, President Boris Yeltsin pronounced a moratorium on the death penalty in Russia. However, the Russian government still violates many promises it made upon entering the Council of Europe. According to Politkovskaya, citizens who appeal to European Court of Human Rights are often prosecuted by Russian authorities.

The court system has been widely used to suppress political opposition as in the cases of Pussy Riot, Alexei Navalny, Zarema Bagavutdinova, and Vyacheslav Maltsev and to block candidatures of Kremlin&#x27;s political enemies.

A 2019 report by Zona Prava NGO titled &quot;Violence by Security Forces: Crime Without Punishment&quot; highlighted disproportionately large number of acquittals and dropped cases against law enforcement officers when compared to overall rate of acquittals in Russian courts. The latter is only 0.43%, while in case of law enforcement and military officials accused of violent abuse of power, including ending in death of the suspect, it&#x27;s almost 4%. At the same time those convicted also receive disproportionately lenient convictions—almost half of them were suspended sentences or fines.

In 2021, a massive cache of videos from Russian prisons and penal colonies were published by NGO &quot;Gulagu.net&quot; with thousands of hours of first-hand recordings of torture of inmates by prison officials, involving rape and other forms of sexual assault such as penetration with sticks. The videos cover years 2015–2020 and were exfiltrated by a former inmate Sergei Savelyev who was put in charge of the video recording system prison authorities as an IT specialist. Russian authorities fired a few prison officials incriminated in these videos and also placed Savelyev on wanted list for &quot;illegally accessing sensitive information&quot;. The abuse was described as part of systematic and countrywide technique for extortion of money and false witness statements by the FSB and law enforcement.

==Torture and abuse==
The Constitution of Russia forbids arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. Chapter 2, Article 21 of the constitution states, &quot;No one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other harsh or humiliating treatment or punishment.&quot; However, in practice, Russian police, Federal Security Service and prison and jail guards are regularly observed practicing torture with impunity—including beatings with many different types of batons, sticks and truncheons, water battles, sacks with sand etc., the &quot;Elephant Method&quot;, which is beating a victim wearing a gas mask with cut airflow, and the &quot;Supermarket Method&quot;, which is the same but with a plastic bag on head, electric shocks including to genitals, nose, and ears, binding in stress positions, cigarette burns, needles and electric needles hammered under nails, prolonged suspension, sleep deprivation, food deprivation, rape, penetration with foreign objects, asphyxiation—in interrogating arrested suspects. Another torture method is the &quot;Television&quot;, which involves forcing the victim to stand in a mid-squat with extended arms in front of them holding a stool or even two stools, with the seat facing them. Former serviceman Andrei Sychev had to have both legs and genitals amputated after this torture due to gangrene caused by cut bloodflow. Other torture methods include the &quot;Rack&quot; or &quot;Stretch&quot;, which involves hanging a victim on hands tied behind the back, the &quot;Refrigerator&quot;, which involves subjecting a naked victim, sometimes doused in cold water, to subzero temperatures, the &quot;Furnace&quot;, where the victim is left in heat in a small space, and &quot;Chinese torture&quot;, where the feet of the victim laying on a tabletop are beaten with clubs. In 2000, human rights Ombudsman Oleg Mironov estimated that 50% of prisoners with whom he spoke claimed to have been tortured. Amnesty International reported that Russian military forces in Chechnya engage in torture.

Torture at police stations, jails, prisons and penal colonies is common and widespread. Doctors and nurses sometimes also take part in torturing and beating prisoners and suspects.

Russian police is known to be using torture as a means to extract forced confessions of guilt.

Sometimes police or jail guards employ trusted inmates to beat, torture and rape suspects in order to force confessions of guilt. This torture method is called &quot;Pressing Room&quot; or &quot;Press Hut&quot;. Those trustees receive special prison privileges for torturing other prisoners.

In the most extreme cases, hundreds of innocent people from the street were arbitrarily arrested, beaten, tortured and raped by special police forces. Such incidents took place not only in Chechnya, but also in Russian towns of Blagoveshensk, Bezetsk, Nefteyugansk, and others. In 2007, Radio Svoboda (&quot;Radio Freedom&quot;, part of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) reported that an unofficial movement &quot;Russia the Beaten&quot; was created in Moscow by human rights activists and journalists who &quot;suffered from beatings in numerous Russian cities&quot;.

In June 2013, construction worker Martiros Demerchyan claimed that he was tortured by Sochi police. Demerchyan, who spent seven weeks constructing housing for the 2014 Winter Olympics, was accused by his supervisor of stealing wiring. Demerchyan denied the allegations, but when the victim returned to work to collect his pay, he was met by several police officers who beat him all night, breaking two of his teeth and sexually assaulted him with a crow bar. He was treated in hospital, but doctors told his family they had found no serious injuries on his body.

Torture and humiliation are also widespread in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The term &quot;dedovshchina&quot; refers to systematic abuse of new conscripts by more long-serving soldiers. Many young men are killed, raped or commit suicide every year because of it. It is reported that some young male conscripts are forced to work as prostitutes for &quot;outside clients&quot;. Union of the Committees of Soldiers&#x27; Mothers of Russia works to protect rights of young soldiers.

==Crime==

In the 1990s, the growth of organized crime (see Russian mafia and Russian oligarchs) and the fragmentation and corruption of law enforcement agencies in Russia coincided with a sharp rise in violence against business figures, administrative and state officials, and other public figures. The second President of Russia Vladimir Putin inherited these problems when he took office, and during his election campaign in 2000, the new president won popular support by stressing the need to restore law and order and to bring the rule of law to Russia as the only way of restoring confidence in the country&#x27;s economy.

According to data by Demoscope Weekly, the Russian homicide rate showed a rise from the level of 15 murders per 100,000 people in 1991, to 32.5 in 1994. Then it fell to 22.5 in 1998, followed by a rise to a maximum rate of 30.5 in 2002, and then a fall to 20 murders per 100,000 people in 2006. Despite positive tendency to reduce, Russia&#x27;s index of murders per capita remains one of the highest in the world with the fifth highest of 62 nations.

With a prison population rate of 611 per 100,000 population, Russia was second only to the United States (2006 data). Furthermore, criminology studies show that for the first five years since 2000 compared with the average for 1992 to 1999, the rate of robberies is up by 38.2% and the rate of drug-related crimes is higher by 71.7%.

===Domestic violence===
Russia has a high rate of domestic violence compared to other European countries such as the UK. Russia decriminalized first-offense domestic violence in 2017, making the maximum penalty an administrative fine for an injury that did not result in hospitalization. Victims describe difficulties in getting protection from police that have resulted in severe mutilation or death, and cultural conservatism which considers domestic violence a family rather than a government matter, and denies the concept of marital rape. The Russian Orthodox Church helped defeat a 2019 bill that would have introduced restraining orders for the first time in Russia, and adding prison sentences for first-offence domestic abuse. The church called the law &quot;antifamily&quot; and blamed it on &quot;radical feminist ideology&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, some women were fined for breaking quarantine rules when they fled their abusers, leading to changes in the regulations. In 2020, the government cut funding for anti-domestic violence efforts by 88% from the previous year. Any anti-domestic violence organization that receives international funding is subject to registration with the government and must label all of its materials &quot;foreign agent&quot;. The advertising agency Room 485 in 2020 launched a campaign against the popular sentiment &quot;if he beats you, it means he loves you&quot;.

===Discrimination===
On December 7, 2011, discrimination without the use of official position was decriminalized. Discrimination through the use of official position remains formally criminalized, but Article 136 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation is practically not applied.

==Political freedom==

===Elections===
Russia held elections on 4 December 2011. European Parliament called for new free and fair elections and an immediate and full investigation of all reports of fraud. According to MEPs Russia did not meet election standards as defined by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The preliminary findings of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) report on procedural violations, lack of media impartiality, harassment of independent monitors and lack of separation between party and state.

===Persecution of scientists===
There were several cases where the FSB accused scientists of allegedly revealing state secrets to foreign nationals, while the defendants and their colleagues claimed that the information or technology was based on already published and declassified sources. Although the cases often garnered public reaction, the cases themselves were in most cases held in closed chambers, with no press coverage or public oversight.

The scientists in question are:
* Igor Sutyagin (sentenced to 15 years).
* Evgeny Afanasyev and Svyatoslav Bobyshev, (sentenced to 12 and a half and 12 years).
* Scientist Igor Reshetin and his associates at the Russian rocket and space researcher TsNIIMash-Export.
* Physicist Valentin Danilov (sentenced to 14 years).
* Physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev (held under a written pledge not to leave city from 2006. In May 2007 the case against him was closed by FSB for &quot;absence of body of crime&quot;. In July 2007 prosecutors publicly apologized to Korobeinichev for &quot;the image of spy&quot;).
* Academic Oskar Kaibyshev (given a 6-year suspended sentence and a fine of $132,000).

Ecologist and journalist Alexander Nikitin, who worked with the Bellona Foundation, was likewise accused of espionage. He published material exposing hazards posed by the Russian Navy&#x27;s nuclear fleet. He was acquitted in 1999 after spending several years in prison (his case was sent for re-investigation 13 times while he remained in prison). Other cases of prosecution are the cases of investigative journalist and ecologist Grigory Pasko, sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment and later released under a general amnesty, Vladimir Petrenko who described dangers posed by military chemical warfare stockpiles and was held in pretrial confinement for seven months, and Nikolay Shchur, chairman of the Snezhinskiy Ecological Fund who was held in pretrial confinement for six months.
Viktor Orekhov, a former KGB captain who assisted Soviet dissidents and was sentenced to eight years of prison in the Soviet era, was sentenced in 1995 to three years of prison for alleged possession of a pistol and magazines. After one year he was released and left the country.

Vil Mirzayanov was prosecuted for a 1992 article in which he has claimed that Russia was working on chemical weapons of mass destruction, but won the case and later emigrated to the United States

Vladimir Kazantsev who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms was arrested in August 1995, and released at the end of the year, however the case was not closed. Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was sentenced in May 2004 to four years of prison.

On 9 January 2006, journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov was sentenced for alleged defamation of the President in his article &quot;Putin as phallic symbol of Russia&quot; to fine of 20,000 roubles (about 695 USD).

Political dissidents from the former Soviet republics, such as authoritarian Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, are often arrested by the FSB and extradited to these countries for prosecution, despite the protests from international human rights organizations. The special security services of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also kidnap people in Russian territory, with the implicit approval of the FSB.

Many people were also held in detention to prevent them from demonstrating during the G8 Summit in 2006.

==Business-related human rights abuses==
There has been a number of high-profile cases of human rights abuses connected to business in Russia. Among other abuses, this most obviously involves abuse of article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These include the case of the former heads of the oil company Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Platon Lebedev whom Amnesty International declared prisoners of conscience, and the case of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, whose efforts to expose a conspiracy of criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials earned him sustained abuse in prison which led to his death. An analogous case was the death in custody of the businesswoman Vera Trifonova, who was in jail for alleged fraud. Cases such as these have contributed to suspicion in other countries about the Russian justice system, which has manifested itself in the refusal to grant Russian extradition requests for businessmen fleeing abroad. Notable instances of this are the cases of the tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former Yukos vice president Alexander Temerko in the UK, the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky in Spain and Greece, Leonid Nevzlin in Israel and Ivan Kolesnikov in Cyprus. A case that will test the attitude of the French authorities to this issue is that of the shipping magnate Vitaly Arkhangelsky. The WikiLeaks revelations indicated the low level of confidence other governments have in the Russian government on such issues. Cases involving major companies may gain coverage in the world media, but there are many further cases equally worthy of attention: a typical case involves the expropriation of assets, with criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials collaborating to bring false charges against businesspeople, who are told that they must hand over assets to avoid criminal proceedings against them. A prominent campaigner against such abuses is Yana Yakovleva, herself a victim who set up the group Business Solidarity in the aftermath of her ordeal.

==Suspicious killings==

Some Russian opposition lawmakers and investigative journalists are suspected to be assassinated while investigating corruption and alleged crimes conducted by state authorities or FSB: Alexei Navalny, Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, Alexander Litvinenko, Galina Starovoitova, Anna Politkovskaya, Paul Klebnikov.

USA and UK intelligence services believe Russian government and secret services are behind at least fourteen targeted killings on British soil.

==Situation in Chechnya==

The Russian Government&#x27;s policies in Chechnya are a cause of international concern. It has been reported that Russian military forces have abducted, tortured, and killed numerous civilians in Chechnya, but Chechen separatists have also committed abuses and acts of terrorism, such as abducting people for ransom and bombing Moscow metro stations. Human rights groups are critical of cases of people disappearing in the custody of Russian officials. Systematic illegal arrests and torture conducted by the armed forces under the command of Ramzan Kadyrov and Federal Ministry of Interior have also been reported. There are reports about repressions, information blockade, and atmosphere of fear and despair in Chechnya.

According to Memorial reports, there is a system of &quot;conveyor of violence&quot; in Chechen Republic, as well as in neighbouring Ingushetiya. People are suspected in crimes connected with activity of separatists squads, are unlawfully detained by members of security agencies, and then disappear. After a while some detainees are found in preliminary detention centers, while some allegedly disappear forever, and some are tortured to confess to a crime or/and to slander somebody else. Psychological pressure is also in use. Known Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya compared this system with Gulag and claimed the number of several hundred cases.
A number of journalists were killed in Chechnya purportedly for reporting on the conflict. List of names includes less and more famous: Cynthia Elbaum, Vladimir Zhitarenko, Nina Yefimova, Jochen Piest, Farkhad Kerimov, Natalya Alyakina, Shamkhan Kagirov, Viktor Pimenov, Nadezhda Chaikova, Supian Ependiyev, Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev, Vladimir Yatsina, Aleksandr Yefremov, Roddy Scott, Paul Klebnikov, Magomedzagid Varisov, Natalya Estemirova and Anna Politkovskaya.

As reported by the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Thomas Hammarberg in 2009, &quot;prior military conflicts, recurrent terrorist attacks (including suicide bombings), as well as widespread corruption and a climate of impunity have all plagued the region&quot;.

According to the Human Rights Centre Memorial, the total number of alleged abductions in Chechnya was 42 during the entire year 2008, whereas already in the first four months of 2009 there were 58 such cases. Of these 58 persons, 45 had been released, 2 found dead, 4 were missing and 7 had been found in police detention units. In the course of 2008, 164 criminal complaints concerning acts by the security forces were made, 111 of which were granted. In the first half of 2009, 52 such complaints were made, 18 of which were granted.

On 16 April 2009 the counter-terrorism operation (CTO) regime in Chechnya was lifted by the federal authorities. After that, the Chechen authorities bear primary responsibility for the fight against terrorism in the Republic. However, the lifting of the CTO regime has not been accompanied by a diminishment of activity of illegal armed groups in Chechnya.

There are reports on practices of collective punishment of relatives of alleged terrorists or insurgents: punitive house-burning has continued to be among the tactics against families of alleged insurgents. Chechen authorities confirmed such incidents and pointed out that &quot;such practices were difficult to prevent as they stemmed from prevalent customs of revenge&quot;, however, educational efforts are undertaken to prevent such incidents, with the active involvement of village elders and Muslim clerics, and compensation had been paid to many of the victims of punitive house burnings.

===2010s===
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov rules the Chechen Republic through despotism and repression. There are gay concentration camps in Chechnya where homosexuals are tortured and executed. In September 2017 Tatyana Moskalkova, an official representative of government on human rights, met with Chechnen authorities to discuss a list of 31 people recently extrajudicially killed in the republic.

==Non-governmental organizations==

The lower house of the Russian parliament passed a bill by 370-18 requiring local branches of foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to re-register as Russian organizations subject to Russian jurisdiction, and thus stricter financial and legal restrictions. The bill gives Russian officials oversight of local finances and activities. The bill has been highly criticized by Human Rights Watch, Memorial organization, and the INDEM Foundation for its possible effects on international monitoring of the status of human rights in Russia. In October 2006 the activities of many foreign non-governmental organizations were suspended using this law; officials said that, &quot;the suspensions resulted simply from the failure of private groups to meet the law&#x27;s requirements, not from a political decision on the part of the state. The groups would be allowed to resume work once their registrations are completed.&quot; Another crackdown followed in 2007.

The year 2015 saw the dissolution of several NGOs following their registration as foreign agents under the 2012 Russian foreign agent law and the shutdown of NGOs under the 2015 Russian undesirable organizations law.

In March 2016, Russia announced the closure of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Moscow.

==Freedom of religion==

The Constitution of Russia guarantees freedom of religion and the equality of all religions before the law as well as the separation of church and state. Vladimir Putin claimed in his 2005 Ombudsman&#x27;s report that, &quot;the Russian state has achieved significant progress in the observance of religious freedom and lawful activity of religious associations, overcoming a heritage of totalitarianism, domination of a single ideology and party dictatorship.&quot; However, reports of religious abuse continue to come out of Russia. According to International Christian Concern, during 2021 &quot;crackdowns on religious freedom have intensified in Russia&quot;. During June 2021, Forum 18 highlighted that &quot;twice as many prisoners of conscience are serving sentences or are in detention awaiting appeals for exercising freedom of religion or belief as in November 2020&quot;. Many religious scholars and human right organizations have recently spoken up about the abuses taking place in Russia against minorities. The U.S. State Department considers Russia one of the worlds&#x27; &quot;worst violators&quot; of religious freedom.

Alvaro Gil-Robles emphasized the amount of state support provided by both federal and regional authorities varies for the different religious communities. In harmony with that, Catholics are not always heeded as well as other religions by federal and local authorities.

Vladimir Lukin noted back in 2005, that citizens of Russia rarely experience violations of freedom of conscience (guaranteed by the article 28 of the Constitution) then. The Commissioner&#x27;s Office annually accepted between 200 and 250 complaints dealing with violations of rights, usually from worshipers, who represent various confessions: Orthodox (but not belonging to the Moscow patriarchy), Old-believers, Muslim, Protestant and others. Anna Politkovskaya described cases of prosecution and even murders of Muslims by Russia&#x27;s law enforcement bodies at the North Caucasus. However, there are plenty of Muslims in higher government, Duma, and business.

Additional concerns over restrictions of citizens&#x27; right to association (article 30 of the Constitution) have arisen. As Vladimir Lukin noted over 15 years ago, that the number of registered religious organizations were constantly growing (22,144 in 2005), however presently an increasing number of religious organization fail to achieve legal recognition or are striped of the legal recognition previously given: e.g. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and others.

In response, the Duma passed a new, restrictive, and potentially discriminatory law in October 1997. The law is very complex, with many ambiguous and contradictory provisions. The law&#x27;s most controversial provisions separates religious &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;organizations&quot; and introduces a 15-year rule, which allows groups that have existed for 15 years or longer to obtain accredited status. According to Russian priest and dissident Gleb Yakunin, new religion law &quot;heavily favors the Russian Orthodox Church at the expense of all other religions, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism&quot;, and it is &quot;a step backward in Russia&#x27;s process of democratization&quot;. Since 2017, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have faced persecution for unclear reasons.

The claim to guarantee &quot;the exclusion of any legal, administrative and fiscal discrimination against so-called non-traditional confessions&quot; was adopted by PACE in June 2005.

==Freedom of movement==

More than four million employees tied to the military and security services were banned from traveling abroad under rules issued during 2014.

In September 2022, Vladimir Putin signed a decree introducing prison terms of up to 15 years for wartime acts, including voluntary surrender and desertion during mobilization or war.

==Media freedom==
Reporters Without Borders put Russia at 147th place in the World Press Freedom Index (from a list of 168 countries). According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 47 journalists have been killed in Russia for their professional activity, since 1992 (as of 15 January 2008). Thirty were killed during President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s reign, and the rest were killed under the president Vladimir Putin. According to the Glasnost Defence Foundation, there were 8 cases of suspicious deaths of journalists in 2007, as well as 75 assaults on journalists, and 11 attacks on editorial offices. In 2006, the figures were 9 deaths, 69 assaults, and 12 attacks on offices. In 2005, the list of all cases included 7 deaths, 63 assaults, 12 attacks on editorial offices, 23 incidents of censorship, 42 criminal prosecutions, 11 illegal layoffs, 47 cases of detention by militsiya, 382 lawsuits, 233 cases of obstruction, 23 closings of editorial offices, 10 evictions, 28 confiscations of printed production, 23 cases of stopping broadcasting, 38 refusals to distribute or print production, 25 acts of intimidation, and 344 other violations of Russian journalist&#x27;s rights.

Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, famous for her criticisms of Russia&#x27;s actions in Chechnya, and the pro-Kremlin Chechya government, was assassinated in Moscow. Former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky believes that the murders of writers Yuri Shchekochikhin (author of &quot;Slaves of KGB&quot;), Anna Politkovskaya, and Aleksander Litvinenko show that the FSB has returned to the practice of political assassinations, practised in the past by the Thirteenth Department of the KGB.

Opposition journalist Yevgenia Albats in interview with Eduard Steiner has claimed, &quot;Today the directors of the television channels and the newspapers are invited every Thursday into the Kremlin office of the deputy head of administration, Vladislav Surkov to learn what news should be presented, and where. Journalists are bought with enormous salaries.&quot;

According to Amnesty International during and after the 2014 Winter Olympics the Russian authorities adopted an increasingly attacking anti-Western and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, which was widely echoed in the government-controlled mainstream media. This was followed by the Russo-Ukrainian War and the imposition of international sanctions.

On 28 May 2020, seven journalists and a writer were detained during a peaceful protest. They were holding single person pickets in support of the journalists who had previously been detained. On 29 May 2020, the Moscow police arrested 30 more people, including journalists, activists and district council representatives.

On 6 July 2020, journalist Svetlana Prokopyeva was sentenced by Russian court on fake terrorism charges. She was fined with 500,000 rubles (approximately US$7000). She works for the Echo of Moscow and Radio Free Europe. In her November 2018 radio broadcast on suicide bomber attack on Federal Security Service (FSB) building in Arkhangelsk, she criticized the government on its repressive policies and crackdown on free assembly &amp; free speech that has made peaceful activism impossible. In July 2019, she was listed as &quot;terrorists and extremists&quot; and the authority freezes her assets. In September 2019, she was formally accused of &quot;propaganda of terrorism&quot; that was completely based on her Radio broadcast.

The Russian censorship apparatus &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; ordered media organizations to delete stories that describe the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as an &quot;assault&quot;, an &quot;invasion&quot;, or a &quot;declaration of war&quot;. &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; launched an investigation against the &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot;, Echo of Moscow, inoSMI, MediaZona, &quot;New Times&quot;, TV Rain, and other Russian media outlets for publishing &quot;inaccurate information about the shelling of Ukrainian cities and civilian casualties in Ukraine as a result of the actions of the Russian Army&quot;. On 1 March 2022, Russian authorities blocked access to Echo of Moscow and TV Rain, Russia&#x27;s last independent TV station, claiming that they were spreading &quot;deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; threatened to block access to the Russian Wikipedia in Russia over the article &quot;Вторжение России на Украину (2022)&quot; (&#x27;Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine (2022)&#x27;), claiming that the article contains &quot;illegally distributed information&quot;, including &quot;reports about numerous casualties among service personnel of the Russian Federation and also the civilian population of Ukraine, including children&quot;.

On 4 March 2022, &quot;Roskomnadzor&quot; blocked access to several foreign media outlets, including BBC News Russian, Voice of America, RFE/RL, Deutsche Welle and Meduza, as well as Facebook and Twitter.

On 4 March 2022, President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up to 15 years for those who publish &quot;knowingly false information&quot; about the Russian military and its operations, leading to some media outlets to stop reporting on Ukraine. More than 1,000 Russian journalists have fled Russia since February 2022. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said that, &quot;These new laws are part of Russia’s ruthless effort to suppress all dissent and make sure the [Russian] population does not have access to any information that contradicts the Kremlin’s narrative about the invasion of Ukraine.&quot; In February 2023, Russian journalist was sentenced to six years in prison for publishing information about the Mariupol theatre airstrike.

In March 2022, Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov wrote to the Chairman of Russia&#x27;s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin that Russia&#x27;s 2022 war censorship laws violate the freedom of speech provisions of the Constitution of Russia. The Russian Constitution expressly prohibits censorship in Article 29 of Chapter 2, Rights and Liberties of Man and Citizen. As of December 2022, more than 4,000 people were prosecuted under &quot;fake news&quot; laws.

On 13 July 2022, the United Nations’ human rights experts condemned Russia’s continued and heightened crackdown on civil society groups, human rights defenders and media outlets. Most independent Russian media outlets were closed down to avoid prosecution, or had been blocked along with dozens of foreign media. Of the many thousands of Russians who protested peacefully against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 16,000 of them, including many human rights defenders, have been detained.

On 5 September 2022, Russian journalist Ivan Safranov was sentenced to 22 years in prison in relation to the &quot;treason&quot; charges. Russian daily newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; called the charges of treason &quot;absurd&quot;. In June 2019, &quot;Kommersant&quot; was accused in Russian courts with disclosing state secrets; according to &quot;BBC News&quot;, the case was based on an article co-authored by Safronov about Russian sales of fighter jets to Egypt.

==Freedom of assembly==

Russian Constitution (1993) states of the Freedom of assembly that citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to gather peacefully, without weapons, and to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches and pickets.

According to Amnesty International (2013 report) peaceful protests across Russia, including gatherings of small groups of people who presented no public threat or inconvenience, were routinely dispersed by police, often with excessive force. The day before the inauguration of President Putin, peaceful protesters against elections to Bolotnaya Square in Moscow were halted by police. 19 protesters faced criminal charges in connection with events characterized by authorities as &quot;mass riots&quot;. Several leading political activists were named as witnesses in the case and had their homes searched in operations that were widely broadcast by state-controlled television channels. Over 6 and 7 May, hundreds of peaceful individuals were arrested across Moscow. According to Amnesty International police used excessive and unlawful force against protestors during the Bolotnaya Square protest on 6 May 2012. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested.

According to a Russian law introduced in 2014, a fine or detention of up to 15 days may be given for holding a demonstration without the permission of authorities and prison sentences of up to five years may be given for three breaches. Single-person pickets have resulted in fines and a three-year prison sentence.

On 9 June 2020, a feminist blogger Yulia Tsvetkova was charged with &quot;pornography dissemination&quot;. She runs a social media group that encourages body positivity and protested against the social taboos related to women. She was put under a 5-month house arrest and banned from traveling. On 27 June 2020, 50 Russian media outlets organized a &quot;Media Strike for Yulia&quot;, appealing the government to drop all charges against Yulia. During the campaign, the activists were peacefully protesting against the government in a single person pickets. The police detained 40 activists for supporting Yulia Tsvetkova. Human Rights Watch urged the authorities to drop all the charges against Yulia for being a feminist and an activist of LGBTQ people.

On 10 July 2020, Human Rights Watch said, several journalists in Russia were detained in a crackdown on peaceful protests and are facing fines. HRW urges Russian authorities to drop the charges against the protesters, journalists and end attacks on freedom of expression.

On 4 August 2020, Human Rights Watch urged the Russian authorities to drop the charges against Yulia Galyamina, a municipal assembly member, who is accused of organizing and participating in unauthorized demonstrations, although they were peaceful. Her prosecution violated respect for freedom of assembly.

On 12 August 2021, report &quot;RUSSIA: NO PLACE FOR PROTEST&quot; from &quot;Amnesty International&quot; in which stated that Russian authorities made it almost impossible for protesters to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. The organization also accused Russia of suppressing peaceful protests using heavy-handed police tactics and by deploying the use of restrictive laws.

==Ethnic minorities==
Russian Federation is a multi-national state with over 170 ethnic groups designated as nationalities, population of these groups varying enormously, from millions in the case of Russians and Tatars to under ten thousand in the case of Nenets and Samis. Among 83 subjects which constitute the Russian Federation, there are 21 national republics (meant to be home to a specific ethnic minority), 5 autonomous okrugs (usually with substantial or predominant ethnic minority) and an autonomous oblast. However, as Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Gil-Robles noted in a 2004 report, whether or not the region is &quot;national&quot;, all the citizens have equal rights and no one is privileged or discriminated against on account of their ethnic affiliation.

As Gil-Robles noted, although co-operation and good relations are still generally the rule in most of regions, tensions do arise, whose origins vary. Their sources include problems related to peoples that suffered Stalinist repressions, social and economic problems provoking tensions between different communities, and the situation in Chechnya and the associated terrorist attacks with resulting hostility towards people from the Caucasus and Central Asia, which takes the form of discrimination and overt racism towards the groups in question.

Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in May 2007 expressed concern that Russia still has not adopted comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, and the existing anti-discrimination provisions are seldom used in spite of reported cases of discrimination.

As Gil-Robles noted in 2004, minorities are generally represented on local and regional authorities, and participate actively in public affairs. Gil-Robles emphasized the degree of co-operation and understanding between the various nationalities living in the same area, as well as the role of regional and local authorities in ethnic dialogue and development. Along with that, Committee of Ministers in 2007 noted certain setbacks in minority participation in public life, including the abrogation of federal provisions for quotas for indigenous people in regional legislatures.

Although the Constitution of the Russian Federation recognises Russian as the official language, the individual republics may declare one or more official languages. Most subjects have at least two—Russian and the language of the &quot;eponymous&quot; nationality. As Ministers noted in 2007, there is a lively minority language scene in most subjects of the federation, with more than 1,350 newspapers and magazines, 300 TV channels and 250 radio stations in over 50 minority languages. Moreover, new legislation allows usage of minority languages in federal radio and TV broadcasting.

In 2007, there were 6,260 schools which provided teaching in 38 minority languages. Over 75 minority languages were taught as a discipline in 10,404 schools. Ministers of the Council of Europe have noted efforts to improve the supply of minority language textbooks and teachers, as well as greater availability of minority language teaching. However, as Ministers have noted, there remain shortcomings in the access to education of persons belonging to certain minorities.

There are more than 2,000 national minorities&#x27; public associations and 560 national cultural autonomies, however the Committee of Ministers has noted that, in many regions, the amount of state support for the preservation and development of minority cultures is still inadequate. Alvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004 that there is a significant difference between &quot;eponymous&quot; ethnic groups and nationalities without their own national territory, as resources of the latter are relatively limited.

Russia is also home to a particular category of minority peoples, i.e. small indigenous peoples of the North and Far East, who maintain very traditional lifestyles, often in a hazardous climatic environment, while adapting to the modern world. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation passed legislation to protect the rights of small northern indigenous peoples. Gil-Robles has noted agreements between indigenous representatives and oil companies, which are to compensate for potential damage to people&#x27;s habitats due to oil exploration. As the Committee of Ministers of Council of Europe noted in 2007, despite some initiatives for development, the social and economic situation of numerically small indigenous peoples was affected by recent legislative amendments at the federal level, removing some positive measures as regards their access to land and other natural resources.

Alvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004 that, like many European countries, the Russian Federation is also host to many foreigners who, when concentrated in a particular area, make up so-called new minorities, who experience troubles e.g. with medical treatment due to the absence of registration. Those who are registered encounter other integration problems because of language barriers.

The Committee of Ministers noted in 2007 that, despite efforts to improve access to residency registration and citizenship for national minorities, those measures still have not regularised the situation of all concerned.

==Foreigners and migrants==

In October 2002 the Russian Federation has introduced new legislation on legal rights of foreigners, designed to control immigration and clarify foreigners&#x27; rights. Despite this legal achievement, as of 2004, numerous foreign communities in Russia faced difficulties in practice (according to Álvaro Gil-Robles).

As of 2007, almost 8 million migrants were officially registered in Russia, while some 5-7 million migrants do not have legal status.

Most of foreigners arriving in Russia are seeking jobs. In many cases they have no preliminary contracts or other agreements with a local employer. A typical problem is the illegal status of many foreigners (i.e., they are not registered and have no identity papers), what deprives them of any social assistance (as of 2004) and often leads to their exploitation by the employer. Despite that, foreigner workers still benefit, what with seeming reluctance of regional authorities to solve the problem forms a sort of &quot;modus vivendi&quot;. As Gil-Robles noted, it&#x27;s easy to imagine that illegal status of many foreigners creates grounds for corruption. Illegal immigrants, even if they have spent several years in Russia may be arrested at any moment and placed in detention centres for illegal immigrants for further expulsion. As of 2004, living conditions in detention centers are very bad, and expulsion process lacks of funding, what may extend detention of immigrants for months or even years. Along with that, Gil-Robles detected a firm political commitment to find a satisfactory solution among authorities he spoke with.

There&#x27;s a special case of former Soviet citizens (currently Russian Federation nationals). With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian Federation declared itself a continuation of the Soviet Union and even took the USSR&#x27;s seat at the UN Security Council. Accordingly, 1991 Nationality Law recognised all former Soviet citizens permanently resident in the Russian Federation as Russian citizens. However, people born in Russia who weren&#x27;t on the Russian territory when the law came into force, as well as some people born in the Soviet Union who lived in Russia but weren&#x27;t formally domiciled there weren&#x27;t granted Russian citizenship. When at 31 December 2003 former Soviet passports became invalid, those people overnight become foreigners, although many of them considered Russia their home. The majority were deprived their de facto status of Russian Federation nationals, they lost their right to remain in Russian Federation, they were even deprived of retirement benefits and medical assistance. Their morale has also been seriously affected since they feel rejected.

Another special case are Meskhetian Turks. Victims of both Stalin deportation from South Georgia and 1989 pogroms in the Fergana valley in Uzbekistan, some of them were eventually dispersed in Russia. While in most regions of Russia Meskhetian Turks were automatically granted Russian citizenship, in Krasnodar Krai some 15,000 Meskhetian Turks were deprived of any legal status since 1991. Unfortunately, even measures taken by Alvaro Gil-Robles in 2004 didn&#x27;t make Krasnodar authorities to change their position; Vladimir Lukin in the 2005 report called it &quot;campaign initiated by local authorities against certain ethnic groups&quot;. The way out for a significant number of Meskhetian Turks in the Krasnodar Krai became resettlement in the United States. As Vladimir Lukin noted in 2005, there was similar problem with 5.5 thousand Yazidis who before the disintegration of the USSR moved to the Krasnodar Krai from Armenia. Only one thousand of them were granted citizenship, the others could not be legalized.

In 2006 Russian Federation after initiative proposed by Vladimir Putin adopted legislation which in order to &quot;protect interests of native population of Russia&quot; provided significant restrictions on presence of foreigners on Russian wholesale and retail markets.

There was a short campaign of frequently arbitrary and illegal detention and expulsion of ethnic Georgians on charges of visa violations and a crackdown on Georgian-owned or Georgian-themed businesses and organizations in 2006, as a part of 2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that, &quot;[In 2005] some 300,000 people were fined for immigration violations in Moscow alone. [In 2006], according to Civil Assistance, numbers are many times higher.&quot;

A journalist for The Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich, was arrested in March 2023 in Russia on allegations of espionage. The Biden administration identified at least 2 US citizens who are wrongfully detained in Russia.

==Racism and xenophobia==
As Álvaro Gil-Robles noted in 2004, the main communities targeted by xenophobia are the Jewish community, groups originating from the Caucasus, migrants and foreigners. 

In his 2006 report, Vladimir Lukin had noted rise of nationalistic and xenophobic sentiments in Russia, as well as more frequent cases of violence and mass riots on the grounds of racial, nationalistic or religious intolerance.

Human rights activists point out that 44 people were murdered and close to 500 assaulted on racial grounds in 2006. According to official sources, there were 150 &quot;extremist groups&quot; with over 5000 members in Russia in 2006.

The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has noted in 2007, that high-level representatives of the federal administration have publicly endorsed the fight against racism and intolerance, and a number of programmes have been adopted to implement these objectives. This has been accompanied by an increase in the number of convictions aimed at inciting national, racial or religious hatred. However, there has been an alarming increase in the number of racially motivated violent assaults in the Russian Federation in four years, yet many law enforcement officials still often appear reluctant to acknowledge racial or nationalist motivation in these crimes. Hate speech has become more common in the media and in political discourse. The situation of persons originating in the Northern Caucasus is particularly disturbing. 

Vladimir Lukin noted that inactivity of the law enforcement bodies may cause severe consequences, such as September 2006 inter-ethnic riot in the town in the Republic of Karelia. Lukin noted provocative role of the so-called Movement Against Illegal Immigration. As the result of the Kondopoga events, all heads of the &quot;enforcement bloc&quot; of the republic were fired from their positions, several criminal cases were opened.

According to nationwide opinion poll carried by VCIOM in 2006, 44% of respondents consider Russia &quot;a common house of many nations&quot; where all must have equal rights, 36% think that &quot;Russians should have more rights since they constitute the majority of the population&quot;, and 15% think &quot;Russia must be the state of Russian people&quot;. However, the question is also what exactly does the term &quot;Russian&quot; denote. For 39% of respondents Russians are all who grew and were brought up in Russia&#x27;s traditions; for 23% Russians are those who works for the good of Russia; 15% respondents think that only Russians by blood may be called Russians; for 12% Russians are all for who Russian language is native; for 7% Russians are adepts of Russian Christian Orthodox tradition.

According to statistics published by Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 2007 in Russia foreign citizens and people without citizenship has committed 50,1 thousand crimes, while the number of crimes committed against this social group was 15985.

As reported by the Associated Press, in 2010 SOVA Center noted a significant drop of racially motivated violence in Russia in 2009, related to 2008: &quot;71 people were killed and 333 wounded in racist attacks last [2009] year, down from 110 killed and 487 wounded in 2008.&quot; According to a SOVA Center report, the drop was mostly &quot;due to police efforts to break up the largest and most aggressive extremist groups in Moscow and the surrounding region&quot;. Most of the victims were &quot;dark-skinned, non-Slavic migrant laborers from former Soviet republics in Central Asia ... and the Caucasus&quot;. As Associated Press journalist Peter Leonard commended, &quot;The findings appear to vindicate government claims it is trying to combat racist violence.&quot;

Under serious police pressure, the number of racist acts started to decline in Russia from 2009.

In 2016, it was reported that racism in Russia has seen &quot;impressive&quot; decrease in hate crimes.

==Sexual orientation and gender identity==
Neither same-sex marriages nor civil unions of same-sex couples are allowed in Russia. Article 12 of the Family Code de facto states that marriage is a union exclusively between a man and woman.

In June 2013, parliament unanimously adopted the Russian gay propaganda law, banning promotion among children of &quot;propaganda of nontraditional sexual relationships&quot;, meaning lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) relationships. Violators risk stiff fines, and in the case of foreigners, up to 15 days&#x27; detention and deportation. Beginning in 2006, similar laws outlawing &quot;propaganda of homosexuality&quot; among children were passed in 11 Russian regions. Critics contend the law makes illegal holding any sort of public demonstration in favour of gay rights, speak in defence of LGBT rights, and distribute material related to LGBT culture, or to state that same-sex relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships.

Also in June, parliament passed a law banning adoption of Russian children by foreign same-sex couples and by unmarried individuals from countries where marriage for same-sex couples is legal. In September, several deputies introduced a bill that would make a parent&#x27;s homosexuality legal grounds for denial of parental rights. It was withdrawn later for revision.

Homophobic rhetoric, including by officials, and rising homophobic violence accompanied debate about these laws. Three homophobic murders were reported in various regions of Russia in May 2013.

Vigilante groups, consisting of radical nationalists, and neo-Nazis, lure men or boys to meetings, accuse them of being gay, humiliate and beat them, and post videos of the proceedings on social media. For example, in September 2013 a video showed the rape of an Uzbek migrant in Russia who was threatened with a gun and forced to say he was gay. A few investigations were launched, but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution.

In a report issued on 13 April 2017, a panel of five expert advisors to the United Nations Human Rights Council—Vitit Muntarbhorn, Sètondji Roland Adjovi, Agnès Callamard, Nils Melzer and David Kaye—condemned the wave of torture and killings of gay men in Chechnya.

==Psychiatric institutions==

There are numerous cases in which people who are problematic for Russian authorities have been imprisoned in psychiatric institutions during the past several years.

Little has changed in the Moscow Serbsky Institute where many prominent Soviet dissidents had been incarcerated after having been diagnosed with sluggishly progressing schizophrenia. This Institute conducts more than 2,500 court-ordered evaluations per year. When war criminal Yuri Budanov was tested there in 2002, the panel conducting the inquiry was led by Tamara Pechernikova, who had condemned the poet Natalya Gorbanevskaya in the past. Budanov was found not guilty by reason of &quot;temporary insanity&quot;. After public outrage, he was found sane by another panel that included Georgi Morozov, the former Serbsky director who had declared many dissidents insane in the 1970s and 1980s. Serbsky Institute also made an expertise of mass poisoning of hundreds of Chechen school children by an unknown chemical substance of strong and prolonged action, which rendered them completely incapable for many months. The panel found that the disease was caused simply by &quot;psycho-emotional tension&quot;.

==Disabled people and children&#x27;s rights==
Currently, an estimated 2 million children live in Russian orphanages, with another 4 million children on the streets. According to a 1998 Human Rights Watch report, &quot;Russian children are abandoned to the state at a rate of 113,000 a year for the past two years, up dramatically from 67,286 in 1992. Of a total of more than 600,000 children classified as being &#x27;without parental care&#x27;, as many as one-third reside in institutions, while the rest are placed with a variety of guardians. From the moment the state assumes their care, orphans in Russia – of whom 95 percent still have a living parent – are exposed to shocking levels of cruelty and neglect.&quot; Once officially labelled as retarded, Russian orphans are &quot;warehoused for life in psychoneurological institutions. In addition to receiving little to no education in such institutions, these orphans may be restrained in cloth sacks, tethered by a limb to furniture, denied stimulation, and sometimes left to lie half-naked in their own filth. Bedridden children aged five to seventeen are confined to understaffed lying-down rooms as in the baby houses, and in some cases are neglected to the point of death.&quot; Life and death of disabled children in the state institutions was described by writer Rubén Gallego.

==Human trafficking==

The end of communism and collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. Russia is a country of origin for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Russia is also a destination and transit country for persons trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation from regional and neighbouring countries into Russia and beyond. Russia accounted for one-quarter of the 1,235 identified victims reported in 2003 trafficked to Germany. The Russian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticised for failing to develop effective measures in law enforcement and victim protection.

<text>The Polish-Russian Peace Treaty of 1686, officially known as Treaty of Perpetual Peace , , but also known in Polish tradition Grzymułtowski Peace, ) was concluded between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to finally end the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). It was signed in Moscow on 6 May 1686 by Polish–Lithuanian envoys Krzysztof Grzymułtowski, Voivode of Poznań and Marcjan Ogiński, Chancellor of Lithuania, as well as the Russian &quot;knyaz&quot; Vasily Vasilyevich Golitsyn. These parties were incited to cooperate after a major geopolitical intervention in Ukraine on the part of the Ottoman Empire.

The treaty confirmed the earlier Truce of Andrusovo of 1667. It consisted of a preamble and 33 articles. The treaty secured Russia&#x27;s possession of Left-bank Ukraine plus the right-bank city of Kiev. 146,000 rubles were to be paid to Poland as compensation for the loss of the Left Bank. The region of Zaporizhian Sich, Siverian lands, cities of Chernihiv, Starodub, Smolensk and its outskirts were also ceded to Russia, while Poland retained Right-bank Ukraine. Both parties agreed not to sign a separate treaty with the Ottoman Empire. By signing this treaty, Russia became a member of the anti-Turkish coalition, which comprised Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Holy Roman Empire and Venice. Russia pledged to organize a military campaign against the Crimean Khanate, which led to the Russo-Turkish War (1686–1700).

The treaty was a major success for Russian diplomacy. Strongly opposed in Poland-Lithuania, it was not ratified by the Sejm (parliament of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) until 1710. The legal legitimacy of its ratification has been disputed. According to Jacek Staszewski, the treaty was not confirmed by a resolution of the Sejm until the Convocation Sejm (1764).

The borders between Russia and the Commonwealth established by the treaty remained in effect until the First Partition of Poland in 1772.

<text>The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R is a motorcycle in the Ninja sport bike series made by Kawasaki from 2000 through 2006. The inline-four engine produced at low speed, and increased to at high speed due to its ram-air intake, making it the most powerful production motorcycle up to 2006 and the release of the ZX-14. It was a contender to be the fastest production motorcycle, and played a role in bringing to a truce the escalating competition to build an ever-faster motorcycle. Its top speed was electronically limited to , tying it with the Suzuki Hayabusa and Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14 as the fastest production motorcycle on the market, after the 1999 Hayabusa was replaced with a speed-limited version as part of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between motorcycle manufacturers that lasted until the 2007 MV Agusta F4 R 312.

Usually 1,200 cc Kawasaki sportbike was called ZZ-R1200 in some markets and ZX-12R in others, but the ZX-12R only went by one name. The 2002–2005 Kawasaki ZZ-R1200 touring motorcycle did use this scheme, going by either ZZ-R1200 or ZX-12C. The ZX-12R&#x27;s R designation followed the race-replica Kawasaki ZX-6R, ZX-7R, ZX-9R, ZX-10R.

==Top speed limited by agreement==

Apart from the first year of production ZX-12R, the 2000 model year was unrestricted, 2001 onwards its top speed was restricted by a motorcycle manufacturer gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that was started in late 1999. This was due to a voluntary gentlemen&#x27;s agreement that included BMW Motorrad and the Japanese manufacturers, amid fears of government regulation of motorcycle speeds mainly in Europe. Prior to the agreement, with rumors of going 200-mph Kawasaki had planned a world press event to launch their answer to Suzuki&#x27;s Hayabusa, but the event was abruptly cancelled, and instead the ZX-12R with a revised engine control unit that limited speed to about 300 km/h was released with no fanfare or comment by Kawasaki.

==Performance==
At its introduction the ZX-12R was Kawasaki&#x27;s flagship sport bike and a competitor to the Suzuki Hayabusa. Its handling and braking matched the power of the engine resulting in a motorcycle that was docile at low speeds and very easy to handle in heavy traffic, but had strong acceleration. The displacement engine generated at the rear wheel. &quot;Cycle World&quot; tested the ZX-12R&#x27;s acceleration at 2.59 seconds. They found an electronically limited top speed of , a braking distance of , and fuel economy of . They tested the time at 10.04 seconds, reaching . The 1/4 mile result &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; reported was 9.87 seconds at , and &quot;Sport Rider&quot; found 9.95 seconds at .

==Monocoque aluminum frame==
While most sport bikes use an aluminum perimeter frame, the ZX-12R uses a unique monocoque aluminum frame. Described by &quot;Cycle World&quot; in 2000 as a &quot;monocoque backbone...a single large diameter beam&quot; and &quot;Fabricated from a combination of castings and sheet-metal stampings&quot;, this was the first use of this type of frame on a mass-produced production motorcycle. This design surpasses the level of chassis strength and stiffness associated with conventional aluminum perimeter frames. Its intention was also to make the bike narrower, and there by more aerodynamic. The design saves space by housing the battery and incorporating an efficient airbox and a cartridge-type air filter that slides into the frame. It was fuel-injected with four Mikuni 46 mm throttle bodies and was Kawasaki&#x27;s first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981–1985 GPZ1100.

==Model history==
The 2002 model was updated with 140 changes. While some of those changes made the bike easier to launch- such as a heavier crankshaft, a reshaped flywheel, and fuel mapping changes- it had less than the 2000 and 2001 models&#x27; . It had a revised suspension with stiffer front fork springs and a softer rear shock spring. The front fender had cosmetic changes, and panels were added to the inner fairing below the instruments and bars. The centrally-located ram-air intake scoop protruding from the fairing that takes advantage of the higher front air pressure was revised. This intake is integrated into a wider and shorter front cowling from Kawasaki Aerospace Company division, lowering the drag coefficient by one point from 33 to 32. The last update was in 2004, with the addition of radial brakes and more fuel injection changes. The ZX-12R was discontinued in 2006, and was followed by the 2006ZX-14 (ZZR1400) which had a similar monocoque frame.

<doc id="785698" wikidata="Q907234" url="?curid=785698" title="French protectorate in Morocco">
<text>The French protectorate in Morocco, also known as French Morocco, was the period of French colonial rule in Morocco that lasted from 1912 to 1956. The protectorate was officially established 30 March 1912, when Sultan Abd al-Hafid signed the Treaty of Fez, though the French military occupation of Morocco had begun with the invasion of Oujda and the bombardment of Casablanca in 1907.

The French protectorate lasted until the dissolution of the Treaty of Fez on 2 March 1956, with the Franco-Moroccan Joint Declaration. Morocco&#x27;s independence movement, described in Moroccan historiography as the Revolution of the King and the People, restored the exiled Mohammed V but it did not end the French presence in Morocco. France preserved its influence in the country, including a right to station French troops and to have a say in Morocco&#x27;s foreign policy. French settlers also maintained their rights and property.

While the agreements with France had provided for interdependent foreign relations, Franco-Moroccan relations quickly worsened following Mohammed V&#x27;s outspoken support for Algerian independence including at the United Nations. The number of French settlers declined constantly, especially after their agricultural holdings were nationalized. Relations with France were to improve once the last French troops finally left Morocco in November 1961.

The French protectorate existed alongside the Spanish protectorate, which was established and dissolved in the same years; its borders consisted of the area of Morocco between the Corridor of Taza and the Draa River, including sparse tribal lands. The official capital was Rabat.

==Prelude==
Despite the weakness of its authority, the &#x27;Alawi dynasty distinguished itself in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by maintaining Morocco’s independence while other states in the region succumbed to French or British domination. However, in the second part of the nineteenth century, Morocco’s weakness and instability invited European intervention to protect threatened investments and to demand economic concessions. Following the Hispano-Moroccan War of 1859–1860, Spain obtained the recognition by Morocco of its perpetual sovereignty over Ceuta, Melilla and the Chafarinas Islands as well as of the territory of Ifni. The first years of the twentieth century witnessed a rush of diplomatic maneuvering through which the European powers, France in particular, furthered their interests in North Africa.

French activity in Morocco began at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1904, the French government was trying to establish a protectorate over Morocco and had managed to sign two bilateral secret agreements with Britain (8 April 1904, see Entente cordiale) and Spain (7 October 1904), which guaranteed the support of the powers in question in this endeavor. That same year, France sponsored the creation of the Moroccan Debt Administration in Tangier. France and Spain secretly partitioned the territory of the sultanate, with Spain receiving concessions in the far north and south of the country.

===First Moroccan Crisis: March 1905 – May 1906===
The First Moroccan Crisis took place owing to the imperial rivalries of the great powers, in this case, between Germany on one side and France, with British support, on the other. Germany took immediate diplomatic action to block the new accord from going into effect, including the dramatic visit of Wilhelm II to Tangier on 31 March 1905. Kaiser Wilhelm tried to get Morocco&#x27;s support if they went to war with France or Britain, and gave a speech expressing support for Moroccan independence, which amounted to a provocative challenge to French influence in Morocco.

In 1906, the Algeciras Conference was held to settle the dispute. Germany accepted an agreement in which France agreed to yield control of the Moroccan police, but otherwise retained effective control of Moroccan political and financial affairs. Although the Algeciras Conference temporarily solved the First Moroccan Crisis it only worsened international tensions between the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente.

===French invasion===

The French military conquest of Morocco began in the aftermath of Émile Mauchamp&#x27;s assassination in Marrakesh on 19 March 1907. In the French press, his death was characterized as an &quot;unprovoked and indefensible attack from the &quot;barbarous natives&quot; of Morocco.&quot; Hubert Lyautey seized his death as a pretext to invade Oujda from the east.

In the summer of 1907, tribes of the Chaouia led a revolt against the application of terms of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras in Casablanca, killing nine European laborers working on the rail line between the port and a quarry in Roches Noires. The French responded with a naval bombardment of Casablanca from 5–7 August, and went on to occupy and &quot;pacify&quot; Casablanca and the Chaouia plain, marking the beginning of the French invasion from the west.

===Hafidiya===

Sultan Abdelaziz did virtually nothing in response to French aggressions and occupation of Oujda and Chaouia. As a result, there was growing pressure for a jihad in defense of Morocco, particularly from Muhammad al-Kattani and the people of Fes. After the southern aristocrats pledged support to the sultan&#x27;s brother, Abd al-Hafid, the people of Fes also pledged their support, though qualified by an unprecedented Conditional Bay&#x27;ah. France supported Abdelaziz and promoted him in their propaganda newspaper &quot;Es-Saada&quot; (). After defeating Abdelaziz in battle in 1908, Abd al-Hafid became the recognized leader of Morocco in 1909.

===Agadir Crisis===


In 1911, a rebellion broke out against Abd al-Hafid. By early April 1911, the Sultan was besieged in his palace in Fez and the French prepared to send troops to help suppress the rebellion under the pretext of protecting European lives and property. The French dispatched a flying column at the end of April 1911 and Germany gave approval for the occupation of the city. Moroccan forces besieged the French-occupied city. Approximately one month later, French forces brought the siege to an end. On 5 June 1911 the Spanish occupied Larache and Alcazaquibir (Ksar-el-Kebir). On 1 July 1911, the German gunboat Panther arrived at the port of Agadir. There was an immediate reaction from the French, supported by the British.

==History==
===French protectorate (1912–1956)===


France officially established a protectorate over Morocco with the Treaty of Fes, ending what remained of the country&#x27;s de facto independence. From a legal point of view, the treaty gave the legislative power to France, alongside the control of military defense, foreign policy and jurisdiction. The Moorish government exercised authority solely in Moroccan or Islamic affairs. Sultan Abdelhafid abdicated in favour of his brother Yusef after signing the treaty. On 17 April 1912, Moroccan infantrymen mutinied in the French garrison in Fez, in the 1912 Fes riots The Moroccans were unable to take control of the city and were defeated by a French relief force. In late May 1912, Moroccan forces again unsuccessfully attacked the enhanced French garrison at Fez.

In establishing their protectorate over much of Morocco, the French had put behind them the experience of the conquest of Algeria and of their protectorate over Tunisia; they took the latter as the model for their Moroccan policy. There were, however, important differences. First, the protectorate was established only two years before the outbreak of World War I, which brought with it a new attitude toward colonial rule. Rejecting the typical French assimilationist approach to culture and education as a liberal fantasy, Morocco&#x27;s conservative French rulers attempted to use urban planning and colonial education to prevent cultural mixing and to uphold the traditional society upon which the French depended for collaboration. Second, Morocco had a thousand-year tradition of independence and had never been subjected to Ottoman rule, though it had been strongly influenced by the civilization of Muslim Iberia.

Morocco was also unique among North African countries in possessing a coast on the Atlantic, in the rights that various nations derived from the Conference of Algeciras, and in the privileges that their diplomatic missions had acquired in Tangier (including a French legation). Thus the northern tenth of the country, with both Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, were excluded from the French-controlled area and treated as a Spanish protectorate.

Although being under protectorate, Morocco retained -&quot;de jure&quot;- its personality as a state in international law, according to an International Court of Justice statement, and thus remained a sovereign state, without discontinuity between pre-colonial and modern entities. In fact, the French enjoyed much larger powers.

Under the protectorate, French civil servants allied themselves with the French colonists and with their supporters in France to prevent any moves in the direction of Moroccan autonomy. As pacification proceeded, the French government promoted economic development, particularly the exploitation of Morocco’s mineral wealth, the creation of a modern transportation system, and the development of a modern agriculture sector geared to the French market. Tens of thousands of colonists entered Morocco and bought up large amounts of the rich agricultural land. Interest groups that formed among these elements continually pressured France to increase its control over Morocco.

====World War I====
France recruited infantry from Morocco to join its &quot;troupes coloniales&quot;, as it did in its other colonies in Africa and around the world. Throughout World War I, a total of 37,300–45,000 Moroccans fought for France, forming a &quot;Moroccan Brigade.&quot; Moroccan colonial troops first served France in the First Battle of the Marne, September 1914, and participated in every major battle in the war, including in Artois, Champagne, and Verdun. Historians have called these Moroccan soldiers &quot;heroes without glory&quot; as they are not and have not been given the consideration they merited through valor and sacrifice in the war. Brahim El Kadiri Boutchich identified the participation of Moroccan soldiers in the service of France in WWI as &quot;one of the most important moments in the shared history of Morocco and France.&quot;

====Lyautey and the Protectorate (1912–1925)====
Hubert Lyautey, the first Resident-General of the Protectorate, was an idealistic yet pragmatic leader with royalist leanings, who made it his mission to develop Morocco in every sector under French influence. Unlike his compatriots, Lyautey didn&#x27;t believe that France should directly annex Morocco like French Algeria, but rather remodel and re-educate Moroccan society. He promised that, in this process, he would:

Lyautey&#x27;s vision was ideological: A powerful, pro-French, Westernized monarchy that would work with France and look to France for culture and aid. Unlike in Algeria, where the entire nobility and government had been displaced, the Moroccan nobility was included in Lyautey&#x27;s plans. He worked with them, offering support and building elite private schools to which they could send their children; one notable attendee of these schools was Thami El Glaoui.

Lyautey allowed the Sultan to retain his powers, both nominal and practical: He issued decrees in his own name and seal and was allowed to remain the religious leader of Morocco; he was further allowed an all-Arab court. Lyautey once said this:

Walter Burton Harris, a British journalist who wrote extensively on Morocco, commented upon French preservation of traditional Moroccan society:

Lyautey served his post until 1925, in the middle of the failed revolt of the Republic of the Rif against the Franco-Spanish administration and the Sultan.

====Economic exploitation====

=====Agriculture=====
Learning from experiences in Algeria, where imprudent land appropriation, as Professor Susan Gilson Miller puts it, &quot;reduced much of the native peasantry to a rootless proletariat,&quot; Lyautey solicited a select group of 692 &quot;gentlemen-farmers&quot;—instead of what he called the &quot;riff-raff&quot; of southern Europe—capable of serving as &quot;examples&quot; to and imparting French influence in the rural colonization of Morocco from 1917 to 1925. The objective was to secure a steady supply of grain for Metropolitan France and to transform Morocco once again into the &quot;granary of Rome&quot; by planting cereals primarily in the regions of Chaouia, Gharb, and Hawz—despite the fact that the region is prone to drought. After a period of minimal profits and a massive locust swarm in 1930, agricultural production shifted toward irrigated, higher-value crops such as citrus fruits and vegetables. The industrialization of agriculture required capital that many Moroccan farmers did not have, leading to a rural exodus as many headed to find work in the city.

=====Infrastructure=====
The Compagnie franco-espagnole du chemin de fer de Tanger à Fez built a standard gauge railroad connecting Fes and Tangier, while Compagnie des chemins de fer du Maroc (CFM) built standard gauge railways connecting Casablanca, Kenitra, and Sidi Kacem, and Casablanca and Marrakech, completed in 1928. Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Maroc Oriental created narrow-gauge railroads east of Fes.

&quot;La Compagnie de Transports au Maroc&quot; (CTM) was founded in 30 November 1919 with the goal of accessing &quot;all of Morocco.&quot; Its services ran along a new colonial road system planned with the aim of linking all major towns and cities. It continues to offer intercity bus services nationwide.

=====Natural resources=====
The (OCP) was created in 1920 to mine phosphates out of Khouribga, which was connected to the Port of Casablanca by a direct rail line. In 1921, 39,000 tons of phosphate were extracted, while almost 2 million tons were extracted in 1930. The Moroccan laborers working in the mines did not benefit from any social protections, were forbidden from unionizing, and earned a tiny fraction of what Europeans earned.

=====Industry=====
Industry during the early period of the protectorate focused on food processing for local consumption: there were canneries, a sugar refinery (Compagnie Sucriere Marocaine, COSUMA), a brewing company (Société des Brasseries du Maroc, SBM), and flour mills. Manufacturing and heavy industry, however, were not embraced for fears of competing with Metropolitan France.

==Opposition to French control==

===Zaian War===

The Zaian confederation of Berber tribes in Morocco fought a war of opposition against the French between 1914 and 1921. Resident-General Louis-Hubert Lyautey sought to extend French influence eastwards through the Middle Atlas mountains towards French Algeria. This was opposed by the Zaians, led by Mouha ou Hammou Zayani. The war began well for the French, who quickly took the key towns of Taza and Khénifra. Despite the loss of their base at Khénifra, the Zaians inflicted heavy losses on the French.

With the outbreak of the First World War, France withdrew troops for service in Europe, and they lost more than 600 in the Battle of El Herri. Over the following four years, the French retained most of their territory despite the Central Powers&#x27; intelligence and financial support to the Zaian Confederation and continual raids and skirmishes reducing scarce French manpower.

After Armistice with Germany in November 1918, significant forces of tribesmen remained opposed to French rule. The French resumed their offensive in the Khénifra area in 1920, establishing a series of blockhouses to limit the Zaians&#x27; freedom of movement. They conducted negotiations with Hammou&#x27;s sons, persuading three of them, along with many of their followers, to submit to the French rule. A split in the Zaian Confederation between those who supported submission and those still opposed led to infighting and the death of Hammou in Spring 1921. The French responded with a strong, three-pronged attack into the Middle Atlas that pacified the area. Some tribesmen, led by Moha ou Said, fled to the High Atlas and continued a guerrilla war against the French well into the 1930s.

===Rif War===
Sultan Yusef&#x27;s reign, which lasted from 1912 to 1927, was turbulent and marked with frequent uprisings against Spain and France. The most serious of these was a Berber uprising in the Rif Mountains, led by Abd el-Krim, who managed to establish a republic in the Rif. Though this rebellion began in the Spanish-controlled area in the north, it reached the French-controlled area. A coalition of France and Spain finally defeated the rebels in 1925. To ensure their own safety, the French moved the court from Fez to Rabat, which has served as the capital ever since.

===Nationalist parties===
Amid the backlash against the Berber Decree of 16 May 1930, crowds gathered in protest and a national network was established to resist the legislation. Dr. Susan Gilson Miller cites this as the &quot;seedbed out of which the embryonic nationalist movement emerged.&quot; In December 1934, a small group of nationalists, members of the newly formed Moroccan Action Committee (, – CAM), proposed a Plan of Reforms () that called for a return to indirect rule as envisaged by the Treaty of Fes, admission of Moroccans to government positions, and establishment of representative councils. The moderate tactics used by the CAM to obtain consideration of reform included petitions, newspaper editorials, and personal appeals to French.

===World War II===

During World War II, the badly divided nationalist movement became more cohesive, and informed Moroccans dared to consider the real possibility of political change in the post-war era. The Moroccan Nationalist Movement () was emboldened by overtures made by Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States during the 1943 Anfa Conference during World War II, expressing support for Moroccan independence after the war. Nationalist political parties based their arguments for Moroccan independence on such World War II declarations as the Atlantic Charter.

However, the nationalists were disappointed in their belief that the Allied victory in Morocco would pave the way for independence. In January 1944, the Istiqlal Party, which subsequently provided most of the leadership for the nationalist movement, released a manifesto demanding full independence, national reunification, and a democratic constitution. Sultan Muhammad V approved the manifesto before its submission to the French resident general Gabriel Puaux, who answered that no basic change in the protectorate status was being considered.

===Struggle for independence===
The innovative fact about Moroccan nationalists is that they globalized the Moroccan question through transnational activism. This way they created a vibrant and wide global coalition of supporters who advocated their cause. This way they also managed to make their concerns global ones. Among their active international supporters was Robert E. Rodes who fought actively in the US Congress for gaining support for the Moroccan cause.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, with political and nonviolent efforts proving futile, the Moroccan struggle for independence became increasingly violent, with massacres, bombings, and riots, particularly in the urban and industrial center, Casablanca.

====Tangier Speech and Casablanca Tirailleurs Massacre====

In 1947, Sultan Muhammad V planned to deliver a speech in what was then the Tangier International Zone to appeal for his country&#x27;s independence from colonialism and for its territorial unity.

In the days leading up to the sultan&#x27;s speech, French colonial forces in Casablanca, specifically Senegalese &quot;Tirailleurs&quot; serving the French colonial empire, carried out a massacre of working class Moroccans. The massacre lasted for about 24 hours from 7–8 April 1947, as the &quot;tirailleurs&quot; fired randomly into residential buildings in working-class neighborhoods, killing 180 Moroccan civilians. The conflict was instigated in an attempt to sabotage the Sultan&#x27;s journey to Tangier, though after having returned to Casablanca to comfort the families of the victims, the Sultan then proceeded to Tangier to deliver the historic speech, in the garden of the Mendoubia palace, on 9 April.

====Murder of Farhat Hached====
The assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by &quot;La Main Rouge&quot;—the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence—sparked protests in cities around the world and riots in Casablanca from 7–8 December 1952. Approximately 100 people were killed. In the aftermath of the riots, French authorities arrested Abbas Messaadi, who would eventually escape, found the Moroccan Liberation Army, and join the armed resistance in the Rif.

===Revolution of the King and the People===
==== Glaoui&#x27;s attempted coup ====
In 1953, Thami El Glaoui attempted to orchestrate a coup against Sultan Muhammad V with the support of the French protectorate. The 1953 Oujda revolt broke out ten days after his &quot;electoral&quot; campaign passed through the city.

====Exile of Sultan Muhammad====
The general sympathy of the sultan for the nationalists had become evident by the end of the war, although he still hoped to see complete independence achieved gradually. By contrast, the residency, supported by French economic interests and vigorously backed by most of the colonists, adamantly refused to consider even reforms short of independence. Official intransigence contributed to increased animosity between the nationalists and the colonists and gradually widened the split between the sultan and the resident general.

Muhammad V and his family were transferred to Madagascar in January 1954. His replacement by the unpopular Mohammed Ben Aarafa, whose reign was perceived as illegitimate, sparked active opposition to the French protectorate both from nationalists and those who saw the sultan as a religious leader. By 1955, Ben Aarafa was pressured to abdicate. Consequently, Ben Aarafa fled to Tangier where he formally abdicated.

The French executed 6 Moroccan nationalists in Casablanca on 4 January 1955. The aggressions between the colonists and the nationalists increased from 19 August – 5 November 1955, and approximately 1,000 people died

Facing a united Moroccan demand for the sultan’s return, a rising violence in Morocco, as well as the deteriorating situation in Algeria, Muhammad V returned from exile on 16 November 1955, and declared independence on 18 November 1955. In February 1956 he successfully negotiated with France to enforce the independence of Morocco, and in 1957 took the title of King.

====1956 independence====
In late 1955, Muhammad V successfully negotiated the gradual restoration of Moroccan independence within a framework of French-Moroccan interdependence. Further negotiations for full independence culminated in the French-Moroccan Agreement signed in Paris on 2 March 1956.

However, provisions in the &quot;protocole annexe&quot; of the March agreement as well the Cooperation Agreement of 28 May 1956, which stipulated among other things that each country should refrain from adopting policies that were incompatible with the interests of the other, constituted an impediment to full independence, as was the right of France to maintain troops in Morocco during a transitional period of unspecified duration. The outspoken support of the Moroccans and Muhammad V for Algerian independence brought about the rapid collapse of these agreements and the worsening of Franco-Moroccan relations, especially after the Meknès riots of 23–28 November 1956 in the course of which several hundred Moroccans and more than 50 Europeans were killed. From a high of 350,000 in 1955, the number of European settlers dropped to 150,549 in 1963, and 25,343 in 1990. French-ownership of agricultural land was gradually eliminated following the nationalization decrees of 1959, 1963 and 1973. Following unrelenting diplomatic pressure by Morocco, the last French troops were finally withdrawn 1 November 1961.

The internationalized city of Tangier was reintegrated with the signing of the Tangier Protocol on 29 October 1956. The abolition of the Spanish protectorate and the recognition of Moroccan independence by Spain were negotiated separately and made final in the Joint Declaration of 7 April 1956. Through these agreements with Spain in 1956 and 1958, Moroccan control over certain Spanish-ruled areas was restored, though attempts to claim other Spanish possessions through military action were less successful.

In the months that followed independence, Muhammad V proceeded to build a modern governmental structure under a constitutional monarchy in which the sultan would exercise an active political role. He acted cautiously, having no intention of permitting more radical elements in the nationalist movement to overthrow the established order. He was also intent on preventing the Istiqlal Party from consolidating its control and establishing a one-party state. In August 1957, Muhammad V assumed the title of king.

==Monetary policy==

The French minted coinage for use in the Protectorate from 1921 until 1956, which continued to circulate until a new currency was introduced. The French minted coins with denomination of francs, which were divided into 100 centimes. This was replaced in 1960 with the reintroduction of the dirham Morocco&#x27;s current currency.

The Algeciras Conference gave concessions to the European bankers, ranging from a newly formed State Bank of Morocco, to issuing banknotes backed by gold, with a 40-year term. The new state bank was to act as Morocco&#x27;s Central Bank, but with a strict cap on the spending of the Sherifian Empire, with administrators appointed by the national banks that guaranteed the loans: the German Empire, United Kingdom, France and Spain.

== Repression ==
Hubert Lyautey established the Native Policy Council () which oversaw colonial rule in the protectorate. Under the protectorate, Moroccans were prevented from attending large political gatherings. This was because colonial forces deemed they might &quot;hear things beyond their capacity to understand.&quot;

French authorities also forbade Arabic-language newspapers from covering politics, which sparked claims of censorship. Under the French protectorate, entire articles were censored from the Istiqlal Party&#x27;s Arabic &quot;Al-Alam&quot; newspaper, which was printed with blocks of missing text.

== Postal history ==
A French postal agency had sent mail from Tangier as early as 1854. However, the formal beginning of the system was in 1892, when the Sultan of Morocco Hassan established the first organized state owned postal service called Sharifan post, by opening several post offices throughout the country. This initiative aimed to limit the foreign or local private postal services. After the establishment of the protectorate in 1912, the offices issued postage stamps of France surcharged with values in pesetas and centimos, at a 1–1 ratio with the denominations in French currency, using both the Type Sage issues, and after 1902, Mouflon issue inscribed &quot;MAROC&quot; (which were never officially issued without the surcharge). In 1911, the Mouflon designs were overprinted in Arabic.

The first stamps of the protectorate appeared 1 August 1914, and were just the existing stamps with the additional overprint reading &quot;PROTECTORAT FRANCAIS&quot;. The first new designs were in an issue of 1917, consisting of 17 stamps in six designs, denominated in centimes and francs, and inscribed &quot;MAROC&quot;.

==Railways==
Morocco had from 1912–1935 one of the largest gauge networks in Africa with total length of more than 1,700 kilometres. After the treaty of Algeciras, the representatives of Great Powers agreed not to build any standard gauge railway in Morocco until the standard gauge Tangier–Fez Railway was completed. The French had begun to build military gauge lines in their part of Morocco.

==Legacy==
French colonialism had a lasting impact on society, economy, language, culture, and education in Morocco. There are also lingering connections that have been described as neocolonial. As a francophone former colony of France in Africa, Morocco falls into the cadre of &quot;Françafrique&quot; and &quot;la Francophonie&quot;. In 2019, 35% of Moroccans speak French—more than Algeria at 33%, and Mauritania at 13%.

There are approximately 1,514,000 Moroccans in France, representing the largest community of Moroccans outside of Morocco. The INSEE announced that there are approximately 755,400 Moroccan nationals residing in France as of October 2019, representing 20% of France&#x27;s immigrant population.

The former Residence-general, designed for Lyautey by architect Albert Laprade and completed in 1924, is now the seat of the Moroccan Ministry of Interior.

<text>5-Methoxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DiPT, sometimes called foxy methoxy or simply foxy) is a psychedelic tryptamine and the methoxy derivative of diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT).

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism that produces the purported hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 5-MeO-DiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT2A receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) may be involved also. The strongest receptor binding affinity for 5-MeO-DiPT is at the 5-HT1A receptor.

5-MeO-DiPT is neurotoxic in rats.

==Overdose==
Excessive doses have caused clinical intoxication, characterized by nausea, vomiting, agitation, hypotension, mydriasis, tachycardia and hallucinations, in a number of young adults. A number of these overdoses are attributed to the drug’s extended onset of action, where first time users, who were unfamiliar with the drug, administered a second dose after initially feeling no effects. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure occurred in one young man and another one died 3–4 hours after an apparent rectal overdose. At least one death has been attributed to consumption of 5-MeO-DiPT.

==Drug prohibition laws==
===China===
As of October 2015 5-MeO-DiPT is a controlled substance in China.

===Denmark===
Illegal since February 2004.

===Germany===
Illegal since September 1999.

===Greece===
Illegal since February 2003.

===Japan===
Illegal since April 2005.

===Singapore===
Illegal since early 2006.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 5-MeO-DiPT as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 5-metoxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (5-MeO-DIPT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===United States===
On April 4, 2003, the United States DEA added both 5-MeO-DiPT and alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) to Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act under &quot;emergency scheduling&quot; procedures. The drugs were officially placed into Schedule I on September 29, 2004. Prior to its prohibition in the U.S., 5-MeO-DiPT was sold online alongside psychoactive analogues such as DiPT, and DPT, neither of which have yet been expressly outlawed.

<doc id="785839" wikidata="Q7753709" url="?curid=785839" title="The New People">
<text>The New People is a 1969 American television series on ABC that focused on a group of young college students who were returning from a trip in Southeast Asia when their plane crashed on an island in the south Pacific Ocean. This program is an extremely rare example of a regularly scheduled network television series with 45-minute-long episodes (which ABC did to try and counteract the competition in the 8:00-9:00 slot, which included &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;); it aired at 8:15 (ET), immediately after &quot;The Music Scene&quot;, another 45-minute program. Less than four months after its premiere, ABC canceled the show.

==Plot==

A plane is shown carrying a number of college students back to the United States after a trip to Southeast Asia for a goodwill tour arranged by the State Department goes awry when they become outspoken about being used as a tool of goodwill that leads to the tour being called off. However, the plane crashes on an island, leaving only a select number of students alive, with the only surviving adult dying from his wounds not long after the crash. The surviving students are the only human life remaining on the island with no radio. The island, soon learned to be named Bomano, is discovered to be unusual in that it was built up as a site for a potential above-ground nuclear test which never took place, leaving all of the buildings and supplies untouched and ready for use by the survivors. 
&quot;The New People&quot; reflected the youth-oriented counterculture of the 1960s. All people over 30 were now dead, and it was up to the young people to start a new society on the island, which would see bouts of sexism and racism in the fight to establish order. The pilot episode was written by Rod Serling, credited as &quot;John Phillips.&quot;

==Production==
When asked about his involvement in the show, Rod Serling stated it was Aaron Spelling&#x27;s show, as &quot;He brought me the idea and I wrote the pilot script. Beyond that, I have nothing to do with it. The show is somewhere between &quot;Gilligan’s Island&quot; and San Francisco State. It may work. But not with me.&quot; A 51-minute unaired pilot was screened at UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive with a full Serling credit in 2012.

==Similar programs==
The concept of having all the adults killed off leaving only the young people to survive was not a new one, nor was this to be its last appearance. This concept had also been used in William Golding&#x27;s 1954 novel and subsequent film, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and in the 27 October 1966 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Miri&quot;.

In 2004, ABC premiered the hit series &quot;Lost&quot; which also featured a group of plane crash survivors stranded on a strange island. Producer Damon Lindelof later joked that if he had heard of the series, he would have used the name New People for the band of character Charlie Pace. In October 2005, NBC began broadcasting a Saturday morning series with a similar premise, &quot;Flight 29 Down&quot;.

==Episodes==

==Original paperback novel tie-in==
&quot;They Came from the Sea&quot;, an original tie-in novel based on the TV series was published in 1969 by Tempo Books, the young adult paperback imprint of Grosset &amp; Dunlap. The author was the prolific tie-in specialist William Johnston, writing under the pseudonym &quot;Alex Steele.&quot;

<doc id="785912" wikidata="Q700859" url="?curid=785912" title="Crimean campaigns (1687–1689)">
<text>The Crimean campaigns (1687–1689) (, ) were two military campaigns of the Tsardom of Russia against the Crimean Khanate. They were a part of the Russo-Turkish War (1686–1700) and Russo-Crimean Wars. These were the first Russian forces to come close to Crimea since 1569. They failed due to poor planning and the practical problem of moving such a large force across the steppe but nonetheless played a key role in halting the Ottoman expansion in Europe. The campaigns came as a surprise for the Ottoman leadership, spoiled its plans to invade Poland and Hungary and forced it to move significant forces from Europe to the east, which greatly helped the League in its struggle against the Ottomans.

Having signed the Eternal Peace Treaty with Poland in 1686, Russia became a member of the anti-Turkish coalition (&quot;Holy League&quot; — Austria, the Republic of Venice and Poland), which was pushing the Turks south after their failure at Vienna in 1683 (the major result of this war was the conquest by Austria of most of Hungary from Turkish rule). Russia&#x27;s role in 1687 was to send a force south to Perekop to bottle up the Crimeans inside their peninsula.

==First campaign==
On 18 May 1687, a Russian army of about 90,610 soldiers, led by knyaz Vasily Golitsyn, left Okhtyrka on the Belgorod Line. On 2 June they were joined by 50,000 Left Bank Cossacks under hetman Ivan Samoilovich at the mouth of the Samora River where the Dnieper turns south. In the heat of summer, 140,000 men, 20,000 wagons and 100,000 horses set out down the east bank of the Dnieper. The huge force, which started too late and was perhaps poorly organized, could only travel about 10 km per day. When the Russians reached the Konskiye Vody river on the west-flowing part of the Dnieper, they found that the Tatars has set fire to the steppe (they had planned to use steppe grass to feed their horses). After a few days of marching over burnt land, their horses were exhausted, they were short of water, and 130 miles from their goal at Perekop. However, Golitsyn built the Novobohorodytska Fortress at the junction of the Dnieper and the Samara. On 17 June they decided to turn back. (Ivan Samoilovich was made a scapegoat and replaced by Ivan Mazepa.)

==Second campaign==
In February 1689, 112,000 Russian troops and 350 guns set out. On 20 April they were joined at Novobogoroditskoye by 30–40,000 Cossacks under Mazepa. They followed the 1687 route, but marched in six separate columns and made much better time. By 3 May they were at the point where the 1687 expedition had turned back. On 15 and 16 May they were attacked by Crimean Tatars near Zelenaya Dolina and Chernaya Dolina. The Crimeans did fairly well but were driven back by the Russian&#x27;s tabor defense and artillery. On 20 May they reached the isthmus of Perekop. Golitsyn was dismayed to find that all the grass in the area had been trampled down and that there was no source of drinking water north of the peninsula, thereby making a long siege or blockade impossible. Further on, the Tatars had dug a 7 km ditch which made moving the artillery forward impossible. The next day, Golitsyn ordered his army to turn back.

The Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689 diverted some of the Ottoman and Crimean forces in favour of Russia&#x27;s allies. They also led to the end of the alliance between the Crimean Khanate, France and Imre Thököly signed in 1683. However, the Russian army didn&#x27;t reach the goal of stabilizing Russia&#x27;s southern borders. The unsuccessful outcome of these campaigns was one of the reasons the government of Sophia Alekseyevna collapsed.

<text>The Columbia Icefield is the largest ice field in North America&#x27;s Rocky Mountains. Located within the Canadian Rocky Mountains astride the Continental Divide along the border of British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, the ice field lies partly in the northwestern tip of Banff National Park and partly in the southern end of Jasper National Park. It is about in area, in depth and receives up to of snowfall per year.

==History==

The Columbia Icefield was formed during the Great Glaciation, or Illinoisan period (238,000 to 126,000 BCE). The initial advancement of the ice field ended during the latter millennia of the Early Wisconsinan period (73,000 to 62,000 BCE), around the time &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; began to appear on the earth. The next major advance of the ice field occurred during the Late Wisconsinan period (18,000 to 9,000 BCE), which marked the end of the major intercontinental land mass bridges. During the Crowfoot Glacier advance (9,000 to 7,000 BCE), humans were beginning to learn farming along the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile rivers. The last major period of advance occurred during the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1200 AD to 1900 AD. Around 1800, the Athabasca Glacier peaked, then went through a period of recession, and then advanced again until 1840, when it began receding until the present day.

The Columbia Icefield was one of the last major geological features in western Canada to be visited and recorded by Europeans, due to its isolation and harsh weather conditions. In April 1827, Scottish botanist David Douglas was crossing Athabasca Pass—a major trading route located north of the Icefield—when he climbed one of the adjacent mountain peaks. He reported his first ascent in his journal, describing it to be in height. In the summer of 1884, geology professor Arthur Philemon Coleman explored the Great Divide from Banff to Jasper in search of Douglas&#x27; giant peak. While unsuccessful, he did discover the route that would become the Icefield Parkway. In July 1898, British explorer J. Norman Collie and his friends Hugh Stutfield and Herman Wooley set off in search of Douglas&#x27; giants, equipped by the famous Banff outfitter Bill Peyto. On the morning of August 18, Collie and Wooley climbed the east side of Mount Athabasca, moved up the glacier when the ridge gave way to crumbling rock, and made their way to the summit, where they discovered an ice field that extended to almost every horizon. Collie later wrote:

In 1900, former British clergyman James Outram came to the Canadian Rockies to recover his health after a nervous breakdown. The following year he made the first ascent of Mount Assiniboine (), then considered the &quot;Matterhorn of the Rockies&quot;. In 1902, Outram made ten first ascents of peaks over and discovered four new mountain passes in the Columbia Icefield area. Two of his first ascents in 1902 were Mount Columbia () and Mount Bryce (), one of the most dangerous and difficult summits in the Rocky Mountains.

Following World War I, other mountaineering firsts occurred. In 1923, American climbers James Munroe Thorington and W. S. Ladd joined Austrian guide Conrad Kain to summit the daunting North Twin Peak (), Mount Columbia, and Mount Saskatchewan () in five days. The following year, another American expedition led by William O. Field and guide Edward Feuz climbed both the North Twin Peak and the South Twin Peak () in twenty-four hours—a combined distance of about . In 1927, A. J. Ostheimer discovered a new route to the North Peak Summit, made first ascents of Stutfield Peak () and Mount Kitchener (), and became the first climber to traverse the Snow Dome () in 36 hours. During his 63-day visit to the Columbia Icefield, Ostheimer and his two companions walked over a and climbed thirty peaks—twenty-five of which were first ascents.

In March 1932, three men undertook a remarkable skiing journey from Jasper to Banff that covered about . When Cliff White, Joe Weiss, and Russell Bennet reached the Columbia Icefield, they climbed to the summit of Snow Dome, and then made a downhill run descent of almost which lasted for —the longest continuous ski run in Canadian history up to that point. Their accomplishment played a major role in generating worldwide interest in the Canadian Rockies. Today, mountaineers and skiers from around the world come to the Columbia Icefield to explore some of the classic routes discovered by these early pioneers of mountaineering.

==Glaciers==

The icefield feeds six major glaciers:
* Athabasca Glacier
* Castleguard Glacier
* Columbia Glacier
* Dome Glacier
* Stutfield Glacier
* Saskatchewan Glacier

Parts of the Columbia Icefield and part of other icefields and glaciers are visible from the Icefields Parkway.

The icefield was first reported in 1898 by J. Norman Collie and Hermann Woolley after they had completed the first ascent of Mount Athabasca.

The Athabasca River and the North Saskatchewan River originate in the Columbia Icefield, as do tributary headwaters of the Columbia River. As the icefield is atop a triple Continental Divide these waters flow ultimately north to the Arctic Ocean, east to Hudson Bay (and thence to the North Atlantic Ocean), and south and west to the Pacific Ocean. Hudson Bay, in some watershed divisions, is considered to be in the Arctic watershed, in which case this would arguably not be a &quot;triple&quot; continental divide point.

==Mountains==
Some of the highest mountains in the Canadian Rockies are located around the edges: 
* Mount Alberta ()
* Mount Andromeda () 
* Mount Athabasca ()
* Mount Bryce ()
* Mount Castleguard ()
* Mount Columbia ()
* Mount King Edward ()
* Mount Kitchener ()
* North Twin Peak ()
* South Twin Peak ()
* Snow Dome ()
* Stutfield Peak ()

== Climate ==

Columbia Icefield has an alpine climate (Köppen: &quot;ETf&quot;), because the weather station is located at an altitude of . The average annual temperature is . The month of July is the warmest with an average temperature of .

<text>Black Vulcan is an African-American superhero on the animated series &quot;Super Friends&quot; and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; by Hanna-Barbera, voiced in the former by Buster Jones and the latter by Phil LaMarr.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Super Friends&quot;===
Black Vulcan debuted in &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; in September 1977. He was created to replace Black Lightning, who could not be used due to disputes between DC and the character&#x27;s creator Tony Isabella. Vulcan was designed by cartoonist Alex Toth, responsible for the look of most Hanna-Barbera superheroes.

In the final incarnation of the series, &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot;, Black Vulcan is replaced by fellow black superhero Cyborg.

===DC Comics===
Comic book artist and &quot;Super Friends&quot; fan Alex Ross intended to create a modernized version of Black Vulcan for his rejected Captain Marvel series. The title would have had the character reimagined as Vulcan, an African-American child who could become an adult superhero after accidentally gaining the wizard Shazam&#x27;s powers.

Black Vulcan makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;DC One Million 80-Page Giant&quot; special as a member of an alternate universe Justice League.

===&quot;Harvey Birdman&quot;===
====&quot;Attorney at Law&quot;====
Black Vulcan appears in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, voiced by Phil LaMarr. This version describes his powers as &quot;pure electricity... in my pants&quot;, which becomes a running gag throughout the series, and originally went by the codename &quot;Supervolt&quot; before calling himself Black Vulcan at Aquaman&#x27;s suggestion. In his most notable appearance in the episode &quot;Very Personal Injury&quot;, Black Vulcan and Apache Chief, among other superheroes, form the &quot;Multicultural Pals&quot;.

====&quot;Attorney General&quot;====
Black Vulcan returns in &quot;Harvey Birdman: Attorney General&quot;, again voiced by LaMarr. Depicted as the 46th President of the United States preceding Phil Ken Sebben, who, on awakening amnesiac to find that he is now the 46.5th president, without having any memory of being elected, goes on to appoint his former employee and ghostwriter Harvey Birdman to the rank of attorney corporal to help him be removed from office, and instate Black Vulcan again in his place.

==Powers and abilities==
Black Vulcan&#x27;s powers include the ability to project bolts of electricity from his hands. By charging his lower body with energy, he can fly at superhuman speeds. On a few occasions, he exhibited capabilities such as converting his physical form into pure energy and traveling through light speed (in an unsuccessful attempt to escape a black hole). He was able to open a rift in spacetime via energy fluctuation. Black Vulcan is capable of spot/welding microelectronics.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A character inspired by Black Vulcan named Juice appears in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, voiced by an uncredited CCH Pounder. He is an electrokinetic, genetically engineered superhero created by Project Cadmus to serve as a member of their Ultimen and operate independently of the Justice League, though the former group are led to believe that they are metahumans. Additionally, due to his powers, Juice speaks with a raspy voice that causes him to sound like he is speaking through a low-quality speaker or radio. In the episode &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, the Ultimen discover the truth behind their creation and that they are suffering from cellular breakdown. They attack their manager Maxwell Lord in an attempt to find Cadmus member Amanda Waller, only to be thwarted by the League and taken back into Cadmus&#x27; custody. In the episode &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot;, Cadmus utilizes an army of Ultimen clones in their siege on the League&#x27;s Watchtower.
* Black Vulcan serves as inspiration for &quot;Young Justice&quot;″s incarnation of Static, voiced by Bryton James.

===Film===
* Black Vulcan makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon&quot;.
* Black Vulcan makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.

===Merchandise===
* Black Vulcan received a figure in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; tie-in toyline as part of a three-pack with Apache Chief and Samurai.
* A 6&quot; Black Vulcan action figure was released in Wave 18 of Mattel&#x27;s DC Universe Classics line.
* Black Vulcan received an 8&quot; action figure by Figures Toy Company.
* Black Vulcan received a Lego minifigure in Series 2 of &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; collectible minifigure line.

== Personal life ==
Peck was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and moved to San Francisco at age eight after his parents divorced. He briefly attended Santa Monica High School where he played football as a linebacker on the fresh/sophomore team in 1986–1987. He left school to pursue acting and did not graduate from Santa Monica in 1989. He began modeling and appeared in magazines &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;.

In June 2010, Peck and his former &quot;As the World Turns&quot; co-star Terri Conn officially came out as a couple at the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. Their relationship was covered in the February 15, 2011, and March 8, 2011, issues of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; magazine. The February Valentine&#x27;s Day issue included an interview with Peck, covering his move to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, along with his relationship with Conn. The issue includes two candid photos of the couple, as well as a cover shot with the caption, &quot;Exclusive: Real-Life Loves Reunite.&quot;

<doc id="785980" wikidata="Q1028408" url="?curid=785980" title="Camden, New South Wales">
<text>Camden is a historic town and suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, located 65 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district. Camden was the administrative centre for the local government area of Camden Council until July 2016 and is a part of the Macarthur region.

==History==

===Indigenous people===
The area now known as Camden was originally at the northern edge of land belonging to the Gandangara people of the Southern Highlands, who called it Benkennie, meaning &#x27;dry land&#x27;. North of the Nepean River were the Muringong, the southernmost of the Darug people, while to the east were the Tharawal people. They lived in extended family groups of 20–40 members, hunting kangaroos, possums and eels and gathering yams and other seasonal fruit and vegetables from the local area. They were described as &#x27;short, stocky, strong and superbly built&#x27; and generally considered peaceful. However, as British settlers encroached on their land and reduced their food sources, they turned to armed resistance which ended in 1816 after many of their number were massacred.

===European settlement===
Explorers first visited the area in 1795 and named it &#x27;Cowpastures&#x27; after a herd of cattle that had disappeared was discovered there. In February 1805, Governor King instructed (apparently reluctantly) a surveyor to measure for John Macarthur at Cowpastures, where Macarthur had been promised land by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Lord Camden. Macarthur named his property Camden Park in honour of his sponsor.

As Macarthur&#x27;s wool industry thrived, local citizens began pushing for the establishment of a town in the area to support the industry. Surveyor-General Major Thomas Mitchell suggested Macarthur surrender of his land for the purpose to which he refused. Following his death in 1834, his children decided to subdivide the land and the first lots in the new town of Camden went on sale in 1840. Camden Post Office opened on 1 May 1841, the day after the nearby Elderslie office (open from 1839) closed. By 1883, the population had grown to over 300 and a movement began to establish a local council which held its first meeting in 1889.

The council consists of nine councillors; three for each of the three wards; North Ward (consisting of Bringelly, Rossmore, Leppington, Cobbitty, Oran Park, Catherine Field and Harrington Park), Central Ward (consisting of Gledswood Hills, Gregory Hills, Smeaton Grange, Currans Hill, Narellan Vale and Mount Annan) and South Ward (consisting of Ellis Lane, Narellan, Grasmere, Camden, Elderslie, Spring Farm, Bickley Vale, Cawdor and Camden South). Lara Symkowiak was elected mayor in 2012.

The federal member for Macarthur is Mike Freelander, first elected in 2016 and the federal member for Hume is Angus Taylor, first elected in 2013. Taylor is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia while Freelander is a member of the Australian Labor Party.

===Planning issues===
On 27 May 2008 Camden Council rejected plans from the Quranic Society to build a 1,200-student Islamic school in the nearby suburb of Cawdor on planning grounds. The site was south of the centre of Camden adjacent to the Camden General Cemetery and north of the then recently relocated Camden High School. The issue received national and international media coverage. The proposal was opposed from within the local community, many expressing fear and hatred about the presence of Muslims in an area where relatively few Muslims live. There were angry comments by a number of residents in Camden that were viewed as racist and Islamophobic. The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) opposed the proposal. Speaking at a public meeting in December 2007, CDP leader Fred Nile (present alongside Robert Balzola) said he opposed the school &quot;because Islam opposed Christianity&quot;. A spokesman for the Quranic Society said it was &quot;absurd&quot; to claim that Muslims are anti-Christian.

In making its decision several council members, including Mayor Chris Patterson, said the school was inappropriate for the semi-rural area of Camden and likely to cause parking, traffic and other problems. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd indicated before the council decision that he wouldn&#x27;t support the school on planning grounds. The Quranic Society said it will appeal the council&#x27;s decision in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales.

In September 2008, a proposal to build a private Catholic school received media attention for not provoking the same sort of outcry as the previous proposal. Some residents who were not supportive of the Islamic school now welcomed the Catholic school proposal.

On 2 June 2009, The Land and Environment Court passed down the decision to reject the appeal by the Quranic Society, with the court stating that the &quot;development application was not suitable for the rural nature of the land.&quot;

However, on 17 May 2021, it was announced that A-League team Macarthur FC had acquired of the planning grounds to construct a football precinct to house the team&#x27;s future W-League squad, as well as the National Premier Leagues NSW squads.

<text>Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible (also known as the Middle English Bible MEB], Wycliffite Bibles, or Wycliffian Bibles) is a sequence of orthodox Middle English Bible translations from the Latin Vulgate which appeared over a period from approximately 1382 to 1395.

Two different but evolving translation branches have been identified: mostly word-for-word translations classified as Early Version (EV) and the more sense-by-sense recensions classified as Later Version (LV). They are the earliest known literal translations of the entire Bible into English (Middle English); however, several other translations, probably earlier, of most New Testament books and Psalms into Middle English are extant.

The authorship, orthodoxy, usage, and ownership has been controversial in the past century, with historians now downplaying the certainty of past beliefs that the translations were made by controversial English theologian John Wycliffe of the University of Oxford directly or with a team including John Purvey and Nicholas Hereford to promote Wycliffite ideas, used by Lollards for clandestine public reading at their meetings, or contained heterodox translations antagonistic to Catholicism.

The term &quot;Lollard Bible&quot; is sometimes used for a version of Wycliffite Bible with inflamatory Wycliffite texts added. At the Oxford Convocation of 1408, it was solemnly voted that in England no new translation of the Bible should be made without prior approval.

==Manuscripts and Owners==
Wycliffite Bible texts are the most common manuscript literature in Middle English that still exist. (The second-most common manuscript is Nicholas Love&#x27;s &quot;Meditations on the Life of Christ&quot; which Bishop Arundel promoted as an alternative to Wycliffite lives of Christ.)
Over 250 so-called Wycliffite manuscripts survive; only 20 of these are or were complete bibles; two thirds have New Testament material only, with no additional material. Other manuscripts are gospel harmonies, concordances, lectionaries and collections: some of these books contain other material, usually orthodox, but occasionally Wycliffite or Lollard works, sometimes sanitised.

40 percent of manuscripts were illuminated intended for presentation or aristocratic use; copies are known for the Duke of Gloucester, by the brother of Henry V, by Henry VI, Henry VII, and so on. Others had fancy or rubricated initial letters. Some of these have extensive commentary in marginalia.

In the first half of the 15th century, production moved to London, and produced smaller, more practical formats in textura hand. Many of these manuscripts have apparatus to link to the Sarum liturgical calendar and were apparently commissioned by clerical or religious patrons for professional use: about 40% have tables of lections (lists of Scripture readings) indicating the books were used in conjunction with the Mass or preparation of sermons. 

Modern scholars have questioned previous beliefs that the Wycliffite manuscripts were primarily made for or used by lay Lollards. Historian Elizabeth Solopova notes &quot;in spite of many polemical claims that the translation would benefit the ‘poor’, ‘simple’ and ‘illiterates’, at the time when the production of WB had peaked in the first half of the 15th century the conditions for a wide use of the vernacular Bible by the laity were not yet fully established. And on the contrary, it appears that in spite of censorship there was scope for a legitimate and sophisticated use of the vernacular translations by the clergy and in religious institutions. The traditional view of the vernacular as the language of the laity and a medium that typified the ‘unlearned’ may need to be modified.&quot;

Many of the Middle English vernacular primers (or Book of Hours) of the time, books associated with aristocratic nuns, provided versions of Wycliffite text for their Psalms or scripture readings. 

One copy sold at auction on 5 December 2016 for US$1,692,500.

==Text Versions==

Surviving copies of Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible fall into two broad textual families, the Early Version(s) (EV) and the Later Version(s) (LV). 

There exist only a very few copies with EV texts. The EV was likely aimed toward the less-learned members of the clergy or the common folk seeking to understand the Vulgate while the later more coherent version may have been aimed toward all literates and for public reading. Both versions are characterized by a close regard to the word order and syntax of the Latin base text: the word order being traditionally suspected of being divinely inspired. The later versions give some indication of being revised in the direction of idiomatic Middle English. A wide variety of Middle English dialects are represented.

The number of LV manuscripts is much larger than the number of EV manuscripts. Some manuscripts mix books of the Bible from the earlier version with other books of the later version. Some scholars speculate that the EV may have been meant as a rough draft that was gradually improved by various scholars into the somewhat better English of the second version.

The translators worked from the Vulgate, the Latin Bible that was the standard Biblical text of Western Christianity, using the standard Paris Bible, and without reference to or knowledge of Greek or Hebrew. The manuscripts of complete bibles included the deuterocanonical books (called the biblical apocrypha by most Protestants) and also included the noncanonical 3 Esdras (which is now called 2 Esdras) and Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Laodiceans.

===Examples===
The LV, though somewhat improved, still retained a number of infelicities of style, some of which may reflect the contemporary transitions in Middle English grammar, as in its version of Genesis 1:3 below. Orthography was in flux as well.

* Vulgate – Latin:
* Wycliffe EV – Middle English:
* Wycliffe LV – Middle English:
* Douay–Rheims NT – Early Modern English:
** &quot;And God said: Be light made. And light was made&quot;

The familiar verse of John 3:16 is rendered in various English versions as:

* Vulgate – Latin:
* Rushworth Manuscript () – Old English (Mercian):
* Wessex Gospels () – Old English (West Saxon):
* Wycliffe EV () – Middle English:
* Wycliffe LV (1394) – Middle English:
* Tyndale (1530s) – Early Modern English
** &quot;For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe.&quot;
* King James Version (1611) – Early Modern English:
** &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;

===Early Version===
The first translations (EV) are rigid and literal translations of the Vulgate.

The existing manuscripts of the EV vary considerably from one another, showing revision. 

The EV may have begun as a Middle English &quot;gloss&quot; on the Latin text, similar to the Vespasian Psalter. It typically kept the order of individual words unchanged from the Latin, which could lead to confusion or meaninglessness in English. It has been described as unintelligible without reference to the original Latin Vulgate. For example, the phrase &quot;&quot; in 1 Samuel 2:10 was translated as &quot;The Lord shulen drede the aduersaries of him&quot; in the first version, then revised to &quot;Aduersaries of the Lord schulen drede him&quot; in the second version. John Stacey points out that &quot;The scribe&#x27;s desire to keep the words in their original order was stronger at this point than his regard for the rules of grammar.&quot;

The manuscript often taken as the original was written by five different people and ends at Baruch 3:20. These authors used different forms of words, such as &quot;loving&quot; vs &quot;lufand&quot; or &quot;luvend&quot;, making it unlikely that they were merely different scribes performing dictation. The finished first translation contains a noticeable change in style after Baruch 3:20. Two surviving manuscripts mark this verse with notes: one reads &quot;Explicit translacionem Nicholay de herford&quot; and another &quot;Here endith the translacioun of N, and now bigynneth the translacioun of J and of othere men&quot;. Hereford fled England for Rome in 1382, returning in 1391, and the &quot;J&quot; who took over may have been John Trevisa or John Purvey. These notes suggest that Wycliffe did not personally produce this entire translation, and may not have written any of it.

For example, Psalm 6:2,3 in one EV version (closer to modern orthography) is:

&lt;poem&gt;
Lord, in thi wodnesse (anger, rage) undernim (rebuke) thou not me;
 Ne in thi wrathe chastise thou me.
Have mercy of me, Lord, for I am syk;
 Hele me, Lord, for disturbid ben alle my bonys.&lt;/poem&gt;

And in another EV version:

&lt;poem&gt;
Lord, in thi woodnesse (anger, rage) undernyme (rebuke) nouȝt me;
 Ne in thi wraththe blame nat me.
Have mercy of me lord for y am syyk;
 Hele me lord, for alle my bones been trowbled.&lt;/poem&gt;

===Later Version===
The Later Version (LV) was issued 8 to 12 years after Wycliffe&#x27;s death. This version has been subsequently attributed to John Purvey. It is generally more idiomatic English and takes more liberties with the Vulgate text. Nevertheless, the translation itself was never attacked for misleading word choices the way that William Tyndale&#x27;s early translations were. 

For example, Psalms 6:1,2 is

&lt;poem&gt;
Lord repreve thou not me in thy strong veniaunce (vengeance):
 neither chastise thou me in thin(e) ire.
Lord have mercy of me for I am sijk 
 make thou me hool: for alle my boness be troblid. 
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Associated works==
Historian Mary Raschko attributes to Wycliffites three primary forms of gospel literature:

* &quot;close translation of the Vulgate,
* close translation interpolated with exegetical commentary, and
* harmonization of the four gospels into a single narrative&quot; (i.e., the &quot;Lives of Christ&quot; &quot;One of Four&quot; and the &quot;Glossed Gospels&quot;.)

===Wycliffe&#x27;s commentaries===
Wycliffe&#x27;s early &quot;Postilla super totam Bibliam&quot; were brief commentaries or notes on the whole Bible.

Wycliffe later wrote several long exegetical commentaries on Revelation and the four Gospels which included Middle English translations of the passages being discussed. To these were added translations of most of the Catholic Epistles. As well, some of his English tracts or works included translations.

One theory of the production of Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible is that these passages were extracted, collated, and completed by others to form the basis of the EV.

===Glossed Gospels===
After the EV was completed, John Purvey (attrib.) supplemented its translation of the Gospels with extensive commentary. Some of this commentary was original, but most was translated from earlier commentaries, especially Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Catena Aurea&quot;. The complete version, known as the &quot;Glossed Gospels&quot;, consisted of more than 90 percent commentary. Following medieval idiom, the glosses characterize &quot;multiple, often figurative meanings as integral to the text&quot;: &quot;It asserts that scripture is always more than what the basic text immediately communicates.&quot;

Only one supposedly heretical teaching has been identified; in one copy, the commentary on Luke 17:19 purportedly promotes a doctrine like salvation by faith alone. Despite this, Queen Anne of Bohemia received a copy and submitted it to Thomas Arundel, then Archbishop of York, who approved it. Arundel publicly reiterated his approval at Anne&#x27;s funeral in 1394.

===&quot;Oon of Foure&quot; gospel harmony===
The &quot;Oon of Foure&quot; was a gospel harmony in Middle English, a translation of Clement of Llanthony&#x27;s 12th century Latin work &quot;Concordia quattuor evangelistarum&quot;, itself a collection of mainly patristic exegetical fragments whose extracted biblical passages often deviate from the Vulgate.

A scholar has suggested the translation represents an intermediate translation project between the literalisms of the EV and the modernisms of the LV. In most manuscripts, the &quot;One of Four&quot; was followed by Wycliffite Middle English epistles or works by Wycliffe.

There may be some confusion here with the &quot;Monotesseron&quot; gospel harmony, whose translation is sometimes attributed to Wycliffe, but which otherwise may have been based on Jean Gerson&#x27;s 1420 work of that name.

===Trevisa&#x27;s Gospels===
The preface to the King James Version of 1611 mentions that &quot;even in our King Richard the second&#x27;s days, John Trevisa translated them [the Gospels] into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen that divers translated, as it is very probable, in that age.&quot; William Caxton in 1482 also mentioned a translation of the bible into English by Trevisa.

However, no such Gospels or Scriptures now exist; it may be a mistake, they may have been lost to time, or be the texts now known as the Wycliffian Early Version. Trevisa also translated Scriptures into Anglo-Norman French, the tongue of his aristocratic patron Lord Berkeley. Some confusion also exists that he translated scriptures into Cornish.

===General Prologue or Four and Twenty Books===
Ten LV manuscripts begin with a so-called &quot;General Prologue&quot; (GP, also known as &quot;Four and Twenty Books&quot;) written by &quot;Simple Creature&quot; that has also subsequently been attributed to Purvey from either 1395 or 1396. This prologue, analogous to the Prologus Galeatus, advocates reading the Old Testament, summarizes its books and relevant moral lessons, and explains the medieval four senses of Scripture and the interpretation rules of Augustine of Hippo and Isidore of Seville.

The reliability of the GP has been questioned because its statements do not square well with other evidence.

The writer of the prologue also explains the purported methodology of translating holy scriptures. He describes four rules all translators should acknowledge:

This method does not mention the EV at all, nor does it mention other translators, leading to scholarly doubts about either the connection of the LV with the EV, or the connection of the GP and the LV: &quot;Simple Creature, far from being a major participant in the translation project, was a wannabe.&quot; One suggested resolution is that the GP relates to a now lost revision between the EV and LV. Another is that it was an introduction to the Old Testament translation only.

The GP also contains polemical anti-clerical material that seems to relate to the restrictions of a later period: &quot;for though greedy clerks (clergy) are wooden by simony, heresy, and many other sins, and despise and stop holy writ, as much as they can, yet the commoners cry after holy writ, to know it, and keep it, with great cost and peril of their lives.&quot;

==History==
There are three alternative narratives about the so-called Wycliffite translations:

* The oldest narrative is that John Wycliffe, as the &quot;Morning Star of the Reformation&quot;, and his household created the first translation of the Bible into English, with a view of making it available to laymen and to break the power of the church, with copies primarily circulating among Latin-illiterate Lollards.
* The more recent scholarly opinion is that while Wycliffe or Wycliffites may have instigated or boosted the initial effort, it was conducted by multiple scholars at Oxford, not necessarily all Wycliffites, with its novelty coming from its more systematic and academic basis, and intended for orthodox, academic and clerical use. Wycliffe is seen as part of a broader revival of English academic exegesis &quot;in the last quarter&quot; of the 14th century, including Oxford theologians such as Richard Ullerston and William of Woodford. According to historian Mary Dove, there has been a neglected culture of medieval English biblicism outside Wycliffite circles.
* A revisionist Catholic narrative, starting from Thomas More, is that there was already an independent history of English translations (of books, verses, phrases and words), which were supplanted by or re-worked into the so-called Wycliffite texts; these older or independent versions were, to some extent, mis-identified as Wycliffite productions for Catholic then Protestant polemical purposes. Most of these older manuscripts have been lost or destroyed, e.g., during the Lollard suppression, the Tudor reformation, and the Puritan revolution. There are no unorthodox translations in the scriptural portions of the manuscripts that can be attributed to the ideas of Wycliffe or Lollardy.

===Historical context===
In the Middle Ages, most Western Christians encountered the scriptures primarily in the form of oral versions of scriptures, verses and homilies in Latin (other sources were mystery plays, usually performed in the vernacular, public preaching by traveling friars, and popular iconography).

The native Anglo-Saxon writing system, runes, was designed for inscribing on wood and stone, not for books, and eventually contributed to the English Latin alphabet, allowing the writing of Old and Middle English.

The earliest written-English versions of scripture were not translations but &quot;glosses&quot; on portions of the Latin Vulgate, such as the Vespasian Psalter. These glosses translated individual words and were used to help student monks to understand the primary Latin, but the word-for-word Old English annotations were not intended to necessarily form coherent sentences and sometimes could not be meaningfully read aloud or understood independently of the Latin.

The Venerable Bede translated the Gospel of John into Old English (Anglo-Saxon) in 735 (now lost), which John Purvey would later cite as precedent when Wycliffe&#x27;s version was challenged by the church. Other precursor translations include the Wessex Gospels, written in the 10th Century: copies were still being made up to 1175.

Ælfric of Eynsham adapted various Old Testament books into Old English, including the Old English Hexateuch, but they were often abridged and summarized. By modern standards, they were more akin to adaptations or paraphrases than translations. A primary Anglo-Saxon genre was the memorized epic poem suited for lengthy recitation by specialist declaimers, so attempts were made to render biblical histories as poetry, rather than prose, such as the Old English Junius manuscript, the Early Middle English Ormulum, the Middle English Metrical Paraphrase of the Old Testament and the Metrical Paraphrase of the Gospels (1300).

In the same century as Wycliffe, Richard Rolle translated the Psalms into the Middle English, using the same word-for-word literal style which would characterize Wycliffe&#x27;s first translation (EV). John of Thoresby translated the catechism into Middle English, which likely helped inspire Wycliffe&#x27;s project.

At the time of Wycliffe&#x27;s translation, most people mainly heard scripture readings and &quot;ad hoc&quot; oral translations at church: the general level of literacy was low (though literacy rates—for reading rather than writing—was rapidly increasing among male townsfolk, to as high as 50% by 1500), and Bibles were costly (before the printing press). It is certain though that the Bible itself was familiar even to laymen in the fourteenth century and that the whole of the New Testament at least could be read in translations.

For most of the previous 300 years, England had been trilingual, with the aristocracy and secular courts using dialects of Old French; lawyers, intellectuals, doctors and religious conducting their male affairs in Latin, the older language of record; and with the general and rural population usually speaking dialects that were still transitioning from the four major dialects of Old English to the incoming Middle English, or Cornish; the linguistic upheaval from the Anglo-Norman injection being enough that the writer of the so-called General Prologue noted that now no-one could understand the old translations (i.e., the Old English.)

Recent medieval scholarship disputes a sharp divide between a fully literate elite who understood Latin, and a completely illiterate, monolingual populace with no understanding of letters and latinities, a common assertion in previous years. For example, the godparent system created a duty for laypeople to ensure that their godchildren had been taught and explained the Latin of the common prayers and meaning of the liturgy, independent of the clergy or schooling.

Latin manuscripts of scriptures were usually of selections of books: especially books of Psalms (Psalters, Book of Hours or breveries), or Gospel books: lay biblical material was designed for devotional and liturgical purposes, not theological disputation; similarly, few manuscripts of the Wycliffian translations are complete bibles. A complete vernacular Bible did exist in Anglo-Norman French, but it was likely rare, as only three manuscripts survive. As well, several Gospel harmonies were popular: for example, the so-called Magdalene Gospel is a summary and paraphrase of the four Gospel with a large number of direct quotes.

An analysis of London wills from before Wycliffe&#x27;s time suggests that only 1% of the laity owned and bequeathed a single book, and only five laypeople in England are known to have owned a complete Vulgate Bible between 1348 and 1368. Even after the Wycliffian translations, the illiterate and poor still usually lacked the access to the Scripture: the full translation originally may have cost four marks and forty pence. As with the Vulgate Latin scriptures, most Middle English Bible manuscripts contain selected books of the bible only, and decoration varied.

===Non-Wycliffite Bibles===

Historian James Morey, looking at &quot;all Middle English poetry and prose that consisted largely of biblical material&quot; wrote that &quot;when taken as a whole nearly all of the Old and New Testaments exist in Middle English before the Wycliffites began their project in the 1380s,&quot;  though &quot;these contents are idiosyncratic and eclectic.&quot; For Morey, &quot;the Wycliffites are &#x27;first&#x27; in their coordinated efforts to produce a complete scholarly English Bible&quot; and their project was characterized by &quot;care, prestige, and organization&quot;  rather than operating in a vernacular vacuum.

====Paues&#x27; Middle English New Testament====
In 1904, Anna Paues published manuscripts of an unknown third translation of the New Testament (missing most of the Gospels) in Northern and Southern Middle English, including two sets of translations of the Catholic epistles from ca. 1388.

====Powell&#x27;s Gospels and Epistles====
Margaret Joyce Powell (1916) edited the non-Wycliffite Middle English commentary and translation of the Gospels of Mark and Luke, and the Pauline epistles, in Northern Midland Middle English dating them to the late 1300s. According to scholar of English Andrew Kraebel, &quot;Nothing about these works indicates that they are Lollard productions.&quot;

====Middle English Glossed Matthew====
Also with Northern features, this is Middle English glosses of the Vugate Matthew.

====Primer Psalms====
Primers were English vernacular prayer books (or Book of Hours) to assist lay or clergy preparation for the Use of Sarum Latin Mass. About half of these have Psalms derive from the LV, but the other half have Psalms with translations from some other source(s), now lost, but perhaps owing something to the EV.===Authorship===
In the 15th Century, the translations were believed to have been made under the direction or instigation of English theologian John Wycliffe of the University of Oxford: Catholic source said Wycliffe &quot;devised a plan of translation of the Holy Scriptures into the mother tongue&quot;. Wycliffe is said to have supported vernacular translations, purportedly saying &quot;it helpeth Christian men to study the Gospel in that tongue in which they know best Christ&#x27;s sentence&quot;. However, it has since become generally accepted by scholars that Wycliffe showed little interest in vernacular use until the end of his life and that quotations attributed to him strongly advocating such a position are from English writings no longer accepted as his authentic work.

From the 16th century, it was generally believed that Wycliffe himself made the translation. Starting in the 19th century, scholars generally believed them to be the work of several hands, all of whom were also priests, with Wycliffe having an increasingly small role. Nicholas of Hereford is said to have translated a part of the text, although this once certain attribution has come into question in recent times; John Purvey and perhaps John Trevisa are names that have been mentioned as possible authors. However, historian Anne Hudson has disputed the degree of evidence for Hereford, Purvey, or Trevisa having any involvement.

The association between the Wycliffian Bibles (sometimes with a radical-in-parts prologue) and Lollardy, a sometimes-violent pre-Reformation movement that rejected many of the distinctive teachings of the Catholic Church, caused the Kingdom of England and the established Catholic Church in England to undertake a drastic campaign to suppress it, although the reality or legal basis of this suppression of the Middle English Bible translations has been disputed.

===John Wycliffe===

John Wycliffe was ordained as a priest in 1351. Between 1372 and 1374 he composed a postil (a Biblical summary and commentary). This was unusual, as postils were typically written by friars, not priests.

Wycliffe advocated a doctrine known as &quot;Dominion by Grace&quot;, under which everyone has a direct responsibility to God and his law. Priests and bishops who did not live in evangelical poverty were committing a mortal sin; bishops, kings, priests and magistrates who were in mortal sin had no legitimate authority over Christians not in mortal sin.

In 1377, Wycliffe published &quot;De Civili Dominio&quot;, which harshly criticized the church&#x27;s wealth and argued that the king should confiscate ecclesiastical property. Pope Gregory XI responded with a series of five bulls against Wycliffe, and Archbishop Simon Sudbury ordered Wycliffe to appear on trial for his beliefs in March 1378. Joan of Kent, the queen mother, intervened and prevented his arrest.

Wycliffe believed that scripture was the ultimate source of truth, superseding even Aristotle&#x27;s system of logic, and associated the words of scripture with the divine Word of Christ (see John 1:1). He believed that preaching the gospel was vastly more important than performing sacraments.

 He promoted an early version of Luther&#x27;s priesthood of all believers, conceiving of &quot;the church&quot; as the collection of elect Christians rather than the ecclesiastical hierarchy overseen by the Pope, and argued that the Pope had no authority to excommunicate believers. Beginning in 1380, Wycliffe wrote a series of texts denying transubstantiation. He argued that Pope Innocent III&#x27;s interpretation of the doctrine was not founded in scripture and contradicted the views of Jerome and Augustine, and therefore constituted apostasy. This rejection of papal authority further worsened Wycliffe&#x27;s relationship with the church.

He believed that the requirements for salvation could be directly understood by everyone, provided they had access to the words of Scripture in a language they understood. On the subject of Bible translation he wrote &quot;Christ and his apostles taught the people in that tongue that was best known to them. Why should men not do so now?&quot; He believed every Christian should study the Bible.

===Alternative attribution===
In 1894, Irish Benedictine historian Dom Aidan Gasquet challenged the conventional attribution of the Middle English Bible to Wycliffe and his circle. He had reviewed the EV and LV from a Catholic doctrinal perspective and found no translation errors that could have made the scriptural parts heretical. 21st century historians have further noted &quot;there is no direct evidence to connect any of the 250 surviving manuscripts of the MEB to heterodox users.&quot;

The pamphlet &quot;Four and Twenty Books&quot; attached to a few of the manuscripts (and treated in later decades as a General Prologue (GP)) did have some unorthodox content, however that content did not seem to contain the specific errors that were later (1458) deemed heretical, suggesting that the GP had been added later and evolved.

Gasquet found no convincing material that connected the EV and the LV to Wycliffe and his circle; for example one manuscript does mention Purvey, but the oldest manuscript does not and the name&#x27;s presence in a later manuscript could refer to Purvey&#x27;s ownership. Wycliffe had never mentioned a translation effort, and his endorsements of the vernacular came towards the end of his life only.

More recent scholars have provided several alternative creation sequences, that would also fit the evidence: for example that there was a previous existing Catholic EV that was glossed at Oxford University by e.g. scholars influenced by Wycliffe&#x27;s biblicism, and re-translated as the LV (and the Paues Middle English New Testament) though not as a mammoth project; one of those involved later added the GP, as the project was hijacked by Wycliffite/Lollard radicals. This would make more credible Thomas More&#x27;s statement that he had seen older English translations in aristocratic libraries that were not Wycliffite (i.e., were the EV or LV without the GP.) Historian Henry Kelly has suggested the evidence for a direct involvement by Wycliffe even as instigator is so slight, that the weaker &quot;Wycliffian bible&quot; rather than &quot;Wycliffite bible&quot; should be the preferred term.

Historian Richard Marsden notes that the records of early Wycliffite sermons do not use the Wycliffite bible translations but made their own from the Vulgate, suggesting that Wycliffite preachers were not the consumers of the so-called Wycliffite Bibles.

===Lollardy and censorship===
Lollard Bibles, Wycliffean versions of the Bible where a Wycliffite/Lollard preface had been added to the otherwise orthodox translation, were condemned by the Catholic Church .

In 1381, Archbishop Simon Sudbury was killed in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. The revolt was largely inspired by John Ball, who was sympathetic to Wycliffe, but likely not connected with him directly. Nonetheless, many in the church blamed Wycliffe and his Lollard followers for galvanizing the public against the church.

Sudbury was succeeded as Archbishop of Canterbury by William Courtenay, who had long opposed Wycliffe&#x27;s teachings. Courtenay convened the Earthquake Synod, named because it was initially delayed by an earthquake that Wycliffe himself believed symbolised &quot;the judgement of God&quot;. At this synod, Wycliffe&#x27;s writings (Biblical and otherwise) were quoted and denounced as heresy.

As a result of the synod&#x27;s findings, King Richard II banned Wycliffe&#x27;s teachings. Wycliffe left Oxford in the summer of 1381, and his fellow scholars denounced his beliefs under threat of excommunication.

In early 1395, the Lollards presented the Twelve Conclusions to parliament and published the accompanying polemic Ecclesiae Regimen. The second translation was finished within the next two years and quoted the &quot;Regimen&quot; in its &quot;General Prologue&quot;.

Thomas Arundel succeeded Courtenay as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1397. Although Arundel had previously approved the &quot;Glossed Gospels&quot; in his role as Archbishop of York, he now began to oppose Middle English translations of the Bible. Historian Margaret Deanesly speculated this change of heart was a reaction against the Lollards for these 1395 writings.

Deansley noted the early &quot;episcopal policy to try to win over the scholarly Lollards by argument and benignancy&quot; which won over Nicholas Hereford. John Purvey himself recanted his heresies in February 1401.

The association between Wycliffite Bibles and Lollardy caused the Kingdom of England and the established Catholic Church in England to undertake a drastic campaign to suppress Lollard bibles. In the early years of the 15th century Henry IV (in his 1401 statute &quot;De haeretico comburendo&quot;), Archbishop Thomas Arundel, and Henry Knighton published criticism and enacted some of the severest religious censorship laws in Europe at that time. Even twenty years after Wycliffe&#x27;s death, at the Oxford Convocation of 1407, it was solemnly voted that no new translation of the Bible should be made without prior approval.

Between 1407 and 1409, Bishop Arundel&#x27;s Constitution &quot;Periculosa&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;Constitutions of Oxford&quot;) took effect. These prohibited new literal translations of any scripture, including individual texts, without authorization from the bishop on penalty of excommunication, including possessing or reading them in public. The Constitutions also specifically forbade the public reading (i.e., aloud, in schools, halls, hospices, etc.) of &quot;any tract of John Wycliffe, or any other tract made in his time&quot; that was not explicitly approved by the university. The ban did not apply to translations as poetry (particularly the Psalms) or paraphrase: such as the Middle English Metrical Paraphrase of the Old Testament.

Although he did not authorize any fresh translations of the Bible itself—it is not known whether Arundel was ever presented with any applications to make new translations—Arundel did authorize a Middle English translation of Meditations on the Life of Christ in 1410: Nicholas Love&#x27;s The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ, an expansive paraphrase of the harmonized Gospels. This translation, which became &quot;the orthodox reading-book of the devout laity,&quot; included newly written passages that explicitly denounced Lollard beliefs.

The base text translated in the Wycliffean and non-Wyciffean Bibles was the Latin Vulgate. Plain English scripture manuscripts without illegal Wycliffite/Lollard prefaces or glosses (especially if explicitly marked as dating before 1409) could not be distinguished as Wycliffite texts, and were, on the face of it, legal. These circulated freely and were widely used by clergy and laity. Historian Peter Marshall commented &quot;It seems implausible that so many manuscripts of the Wycliffite bible could have survived…if bishops had really been determined to suppress it in all circumstances.&quot; 

Catholic commentators of the 15th and 16th centuries such as Thomas More believed these manuscript Middle English English Bibles to represented an anonymous earlier orthodox translation: subsequent scholars relied on a lack of evidence for such a tradition, until the re-discovery of various non-Wycliffean scripture manuscripts in the 20th century, such as the Paues manuscripts and Holkam Hall misc. 40, which pairs non-Wycliffite translations of the Epistles and Acts with the Wycliffite EV Gospels.

The Suppression of Heresy Act 1414 specifically ordered that possession of heretical material must be treated as information in any investigation not as evidence of heresy &quot;per se&quot;.

Manuscripts of Middle English vernacular scriptures had thus been effectively suppressed though not, for private use without Wycliffite paratexts by orthodox readers, actually prohibited, though this was primarily enforced against heretical members of the lower classes, not the aristocracy. According to historian Henry Ansgar Kelly, it was not until 1458, following the odd case of Richard Hunne that systematic efforts at prohibition took effect, however even partisan Elizabethan historian John Foxe noted the dubious legal basis of what became assumed, for centuries, was a blanket ban.

This strict enforcement of religious orthodoxy may have constrained the development of Middle English literature and religious thought over the next century. David Daniell suggests that &quot;had he written after 1409, his anti-clericalism would have led Chaucer himself to be investigated as a heretic&quot; and David Lawton claims that the Constitutions made it unsafe to write works like Piers Plowman. Bishop Reginald Pecock attempted to rebut Lollardy on Wycliffe&#x27;s own terms, writing in the vernacular and relying on scripture and reason instead of church authority. Stephen Lahey argues that these responses &quot;may be the first genuine philosophical literature in the English language.&quot; Despite arguing in favor of the Catholic church, Pecock&#x27;s approach led to his own charges of heresy.

==Influence==
===Influence on subsequent English Bibles===
While the Middle English Bible translations were based on the Latin Vulgate, the Reformation era translations by William Tyndale (Tyndale Bible) and Miles Coverdale (Great Bible) also used the original Greek and Hebrew. Tyndale does not credit Wycliffe as a source, but he was almost certainly familiar with Wycliffian Bibles, and his translation sometimes seems to overlap with them. He may have been influenced by hearing the Wycliffian versions read aloud, but the degree of influence is unclear and actively debated.

Despite being written more than a century later, Tyndale&#x27;s translation came to overshadow Wycliffe&#x27;s. According to the Cambridge History of the Bible, &quot;The Bible which permeated the minds of later generations shows no direct descent from the Wycliffite versions... Tyndale&#x27;s return to the original languages meant that translations based on the intermediate Latin of the Vulgate would soon be out of date.&quot; Consequently, it was generally ignored in later English Protestant biblical scholarship. Herbert Brook Workman argues that &quot;In later years the existence of Wyclif&#x27;s version seems to have been forgotten&quot;, pointing out that John Wesley incorrectly identified Tyndale&#x27;s Bible as the first English translation.

However, surviving manuscripts of Wycliffian Bibles without Lollard/Wycliffite additions were commonly accepted as works of an unknown Catholic translator; so these manuscripts continued to circulate among 16th-century English Catholics, and many of its renderings of the Vulgate into English were or became established idiom and were adopted by the translators of the Rheims New Testament, one of the bases of the King James Version.

===Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible in print===
The earliest printed edition, of the New Testament only, was by John Lewis in 1731.

In 1850, Forshall and Madden published a four-volume critical edition of the Wycliffian Bibles containing the text of the earlier and later versions in parallel columns. Forshall and Madden&#x27;s edition retains the letter yogh (ʒ) but replaces thorn (þ) with the digraph &quot;th&quot;.

===In popular culture===
* Jorge Luis Borges mentions Wycliffite Bibles in his short story &quot;The Book of Sand&quot;, where he calls it the &quot;Black-letter Wyclif&quot;, in reference to the Blackletter script used to write the publication.

<text>An executive information system (EIS), also known as an executive support system (ESS), is a type of management support system that facilitates and supports senior executive information and decision-making needs. It provides easy access to internal and external information relevant to organizational goals. It is commonly considered a specialized form of decision support system (DSS).

EIS emphasizes graphical displays and easy-to-use user interfaces. They offer strong reporting and drill-down capabilities. In general, EIS are enterprise-wide DSS that help top-level executives analyze, compare, and highlight trends in important variables so that they can monitor performance and identify opportunities and problems. EIS and data warehousing technologies are converging in the marketplace.

The term EIS lost popularity in favor of business intelligence (with the sub areas of reporting, analytics, and digital dashboards).

== History ==

Traditionally, executive information systems were mainframe computer-based programs. The purpose was to package a company&#x27;s data and to provide sales performance or market research statistics for decision makers, such as, marketing directors, chief executive officer, who were not necessarily well acquainted with computers. The objective was to develop computer applications that highlighted information to satisfy senior executives&#x27; needs. Typically, an EIS provides only data that supported executive level decisions, not all company data.

Today, the application of EIS is not only in typical corporate hierarchies, but also at lower corporate levels. As some client service companies adopt the latest enterprise information systems, employees can use their personal computers to get access to the company&#x27;s data and identify information relevant to their decision making. This arrangement provides relevant information to upper and lower corporate levels.

== Components ==
EIS components can typically be classified as:
* Hardware
* Software
* User interface
* Telecommunications

=== Hardware ===
When talking about computer hardware for an EIS environment, we should focus on the hardware that meets the executive&#x27;s need. The executive must be put first and the executive&#x27;s needs must be defined before the hardware can be selected. The basic hardware needed for a typical EIS includes four components: 
# Input data-entry devices. These devices allow the executive to enter, verify, and update data immediately
# The central processing unit (CPU), which is the most important because it controls the other computer system components
# Data storage files. The executive can use this part to save useful business information, and this part also helps the executive to search historical business information easily
# Output devices, which provide a visual or permanent record for the executive to save or read. This device refers to the visual output device such as monitor or printer

In addition, with the advent of local area networks (LAN), several EIS products for networked workstations became available. These systems require less support and less expensive computer hardware. They also increase EIS information access to more company users.

=== Software ===
Choosing the appropriate software is vital to an effective EIS. Therefore, the software components and how they integrate the data into one system are important. A typical EIS includes four software components:
# Text: handling software—documents are typically text-based
# Database: heterogeneous databases on a range of vendor-specific and open computer platforms help executives access both internal and external data
# Graphic base: graphics can turn volumes of text and statistics into visual information for executives. Typical graphic types are: time series charts, scatter diagrams, maps, motion graphics, sequence charts, and comparison-oriented graphs (i.e., bar charts)
# Model base—EIS models contain routine and special statistical, financial, and other quantitative analysis

=== User interface ===
An EIS must be efficient to retrieve relevant data for decision makers, so the user interface is very important. Several types of interfaces can be available to the EIS structure, such as scheduled reports, questions/answers, menu driven, command language, natural language, and input/output.

=== Telecommunication ===
As decentralizing is becoming a trend in companies, telecommunications plays a pivotal role in networked information systems. Transmitting data from one place to another has become crucial for establishing a reliable network. In addition, telecommunications within an EIS can accelerate the need for access to distributed data. It can be both by scientific and business means.

== Applications ==
EIS helps executives find data according to user-defined criteria and promote information-based insight and understanding. Unlike a traditional management information system presentation, EIS can distinguish between vital and seldom-used data, and track different key critical activities for executives, both which are helpful in evaluating if the company is meeting its corporate objectives. After realizing its advantages, people have applied EIS in many areas, especially, in manufacturing, marketing, and finance areas.

=== Manufacturing ===
Manufacturing is the transformation of raw materials into finished goods for sale, or intermediate processes involving the production or finishing of semi-manufactures. It is a large branch of industry and of secondary production. Manufacturing operational control focuses on day-to-day operations, and the central idea of this process is effectiveness.

=== Marketing ===
In an organization, marketing executives&#x27; duty is managing available marketing resources to create a more effective future. For this, they need make judgments about risk and uncertainty of a project and its impact on the company in short term and long term. To assist marketing executives in making effective marketing decisions, an EIS can be applied. EIS provides sales forecasting, which can allow the market executive to compare sales forecast with past sales. EIS also offers an approach to product price, which is found in venture analysis. The market executive can evaluate pricing as related to competition along with the relationship of product quality with price charged. In summary, EIS software package enables marketing executives to manipulate the data by looking for trends, performing audits of the sales data, and calculating totals, averages, changes, variances, or ratios.

=== Financial analysis ===
Financial analysis is one of the most important steps to companies today. Executives needs to use financial ratios and cash flow analysis to estimate the trends and make capital investment decisions. An EIS integrates planning or budgeting with control of performance reporting, and it can be extremely helpful to finance executives. EIS focuses on financial performance accountability, and recognizes the importance of cost standards and flexible budgeting in developing the quality of information provided for all executive levels.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Advantages of ESS ===
* Easy for upper-level executives to use, extensive computer experience is not required in operations
* Provides strong drill-down capabilities to better analyze the given information.
* Information that is provided is better understood
* EIS provides timely delivery of information. Management can make decisions promptly.
* Improves tracking information
* Offers efficiency to decision makers

=== Disadvantages of ESS ===
* System dependent
* Limited functionality, by design
* Information overload for some managers
* Benefits hard to quantify
* High implementation costs
* System may become slow, large, and hard to manage
* Need good internal processes for data management
* May lead to less reliable and less secure data
* Excessive cost for small company

== Future trends ==

This trend frees executives from learning different computer operating systems, and substantially decreases implementation costs. Because this trend includes using existing software applications, executives don&#x27;t need to learn a new or special language for the EIS package. 

Interactive visualizations are trending. 3D visualizations in a VR/AR environment looks like a possibility already. Also, predictive analytics open the doors for (machine) learning what is going to be next based on data from the past. While the data processing can be done in many ways, learning is not completely unsupervised. There is still a good deal of classification using expert personnel analysis. In near realtime scenarios, latencies while doing ML can be a barrier. Optimizing data models, size and processing path/time are ongoing work. As more data is captured at different data stages in not only EIS apps but also other enterprise apps, audio and video tagging can catalyse data discovery.

<doc id="786020" wikidata="Q161521" url="?curid=786020" title="1,4-Butanediol">
<text>1,4-Butanediol, also called Butane-1,4-diol (other names include 1,4-B, BD, BDO and 1,4-BD), is a primary alcohol and an organic compound with the formula HOCH2CH2CH2CH2OH. It is a colorless viscous liquid first synthesized in 1890 via acidic hydrolysis of N,N&#x27;-dinitro-1,4-butanediamine by Dutch chemist Pieter Johannes Dekkers, who called it &quot;tetramethylene glycol&quot;.

==Synthesis==
In one industrial chemical synthesis, acetylene reacts with two equivalents of formaldehyde to form butyne-1,4-diol. Hydrogenation of butyne-1,4-diol gives butane-1,4-diol. It is also made on an industrial scale from maleic anhydride in the Davy process, which is first converted to the methyl maleate ester, then hydrogenated. Other routes are from butadiene, allyl acetate and succinic acid.

A biological route to BD has been commercialized that uses a genetically modified organism. The biosynthesis proceeds via 4-hydroxybutyrate.

==Industrial use==
Butane-1,4-diol is used industrially as a solvent and in the manufacture of some types of plastics, elastic fibers and polyurethanes. In organic chemistry, 1,4-butanediol is used for the synthesis of γ-butyrolactone (GBL). In the presence of phosphoric acid and high temperature, it dehydrates to the important solvent tetrahydrofuran. At about 200 °C in the presence of soluble ruthenium catalysts, the diol undergoes dehydrogenation to form butyrolactone. It is used to synthesize 1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether which is then used as a reactive diluent for epoxy resins.

1,4-Butanediol is used in the production of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) plastic.

World production of butane-1,4-diol was claimed to be about one million metric tons per year and market price is about 2,000 (€1,600) per ton (2005). In 2013, worldwide production was claimed to be billions of pounds (consistent with approximately one million metric tons).

Almost half of it is dehydrated to tetrahydrofuran to make fibers such as Spandex. The largest producer is BASF.

==Use as a recreational drug==

Butane-1,4-diol is also used as a recreational drug known by some users as &quot;Bute&quot;, &quot;One Comma Four&quot;, &quot;Liquid Fantasy&quot;, &quot;One Four Bee&quot; or &quot;One Four B-D-O&quot;.

Some federal courts in the USA have stated that 1,4-butanediol exerts effects similar to its metabolite, GABA analogue gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), but several other federal courts have ruled that it does not.

1,4-butenediol (CAS 110-64-5) may be incorrectly sold as 1,4-butanediol but should not be confused with it.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Butane-1,4-diol is rapidly converted into GHB acid by the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, and differing levels of these enzymes may account for differences in effects and side effects between users. While co-administration of ethanol and GHB already poses serious risks, co-administration of ethanol with 1,4-butanediol will interact considerably and has many other potential risks. This is because the same enzymes that are responsible for metabolizing alcohol also metabolize 1,4-butanediol so there is a strong chance of a dangerous drug interaction. Emergency room patients who overdose on both ethanol and 1,4-butanediol often present with symptoms of alcohol intoxication initially and as the ethanol is metabolized the 1,4-butanediol is then able to better compete for the enzyme and a second period of intoxication ensues as the 1,4-butanediol is converted into GHB.
===Pharmacodynamics===
Butane-1,4-diol seems to have two types of pharmacological actions. The major psychoactive effects of 1,4-butanediol are because it is metabolized into GHB; however there is a study suggesting that 1,4-butanediol may have potential alcohol-like pharmacological effects on its own. The study arrived at this conclusion based on the finding that butane-1,4-diol coadministered with ethanol led to potentiation of some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. However, potentiation of ethanol&#x27;s effects may simply be caused by competition for the alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes with co-administered 1,4-butanediol. The shared metabolic rate-limiting steps thus leads to slowed metabolism and clearance for both compounds including ethanol&#x27;s known toxic metabolite acetaldehyde.

Another study found no effect following intracerebroventricular injection of butane-1,4-diol in rats. This contradicts the hypothesis of butane-1,4-diol having inherent alcohol-like pharmacological effects.

Like gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, butane-1,4-diol is safe only in small amounts. Adverse effects in higher doses include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sedation, vertigo, and potentially death if ingested in large amounts. Anxiolytic effects are diminished and side effects increased when used in combination with alcohol.

===Legality===
While butane-1,4-diol is not currently scheduled federally in the United States, a number of states have classified 1,4-butanediol as a controlled substance. Individuals have been prosecuted for possession of 1,4-butanediol under the Federal Analog Act as substantially similar to GHB. A federal case in New York in 2002 ruled that 1,4-butanediol could not be considered an analog of GHB under federal law, but that decision was later overturned by the Second Circuit. A jury in Federal District Court in Chicago found that 1,4-butanediol was not an analog of GHB under federal law, which was not disputed on the case&#x27;s appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, however this finding did not affect the outcome of the case. In the United Kingdom, 1,4-butanediol was scheduled in December 2009 (along with another GHB precursor, gamma-butyrolactone) as a Class C controlled substance. In Germany, the drug is not explicitly illegal, but might also be treated as illegal if used as a drug. It is controlled as a Schedule VI precursor in Canada.

===2007 contamination of Bindeez toy===

A toy called &quot;Bindeez&quot; (&quot;Aqua Dots&quot; in North America) was recalled by the distributor in November 2007 because of the presence of butane-1,4-diol. The toy consists of small beads that stick to each other by sprinkling water. Butane-1,4-diol was detected by GC-MS. The production plant seems to have intended to cut costs by replacing less toxic pentane-1,5-diol with butane-1,4-diol. ChemNet China listed the price of butane-1,4-diol at between about US$1,350–2,800 per metric ton, while the price for 1,5-pentanediol is about US$9,700 per metric ton.

===2021 poisoning at Darmstadt Technical University===
In August 2021, several people fell severely ill after consuming drinks at building L2.01 at the Lichtwiese Campus of Darmstadt Technical University, Germany. Seven showed severe symptoms, two were transported to a hospital in Frankfurt am Main, and a 30-year-old person was, for a time, in a critical state. Butane-1,4-diol had been detected in milk packages, as well as in water filters. At the location, detectives also found bromophenols and dicyclohexylamine.

<doc id="786056" wikidata="Q105999" url="?curid=786056" title="Cargo ship">
<text>A cargo ship or freighter is a merchant ship that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world&#x27;s seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built of welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped.

== Definitions ==


The words &quot;cargo&quot; and &quot;freight&quot; have become interchangeable in casual usage. Technically, &quot;cargo&quot; refers to the goods carried aboard the ship for hire, while &quot;freight&quot; refers to the act of carrying of such cargo, but the terms have been used interchangeably for centuries.

Generally, the modern ocean shipping business is divided into two classes:
# Liner business: typically (but not exclusively) container vessels (wherein &quot;general cargo&quot; is carried in 20- or 40-foot containers), operating as &quot;common carriers&quot;, calling at a regularly published schedule of ports. A common carrier refers to a regulated service where any member of the public may book cargo for shipment, according to long-established and internationally agreed rules.
# Tramp-tanker business: generally this is private business arranged between the shipper and receiver and facilitated by the vessel owners or operators, who offer their vessels for hire to carry bulk (dry or liquid) or break bulk (cargoes with individually handled pieces) to any suitable port(s) in the world, according to a specifically drawn contract, called a charter party.

Larger cargo ships are generally operated by shipping lines: companies that specialize in the handling of cargo in general. Smaller vessels, such as coasters, are often owned by their operators.

=== Types ===

Cargo ships/freighters can be divided into eight groups, according to the type of cargo they carry. These groups are:
# Feeder ship
# General cargo vessels
# Container ships
# Tankers
# Dry bulk carriers
# Multi-purpose vessels
# Reefer ships
# Roll-on/roll-off vessels.

==== Rough synopses of cargo ship types ====
# General cargo vessels carry packaged items like chemicals, foods, furniture, machinery, motor- and military vehicles, footwear, garments, etc.
# Container ships (sometimes spelled containerships) are cargo ships that carry all of their load in truck-size intermodal containers, in a technique called containerization. They are a common means of commercial intermodal freight transport and now carry most seagoing non-bulk cargo. Container ship capacity is measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU).
# Tankers carry petroleum products or other liquid cargo.
# Dry bulk carriers carry coal, grain, ore and other similar products in loose form.
# Multi-purpose vessels, as the name suggests, carry different classes of cargo – e.g. liquid and general cargo – at the same time.
# A Reefer, Reefer ships (or Refrigerated) ship is specifically designed and used for shipping perishable commodities which require temperature-controlled, mostly fruits, meat, fish, vegetables, dairy products and other foodstuffs.
# Roll-on/roll-off (RORO or ro-ro) ships are designed to carry wheeled cargo, such as cars, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers, and railroad cars, that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels.
# Timber (Lumber) carriers that transport lumber, logs and related wood products.

==== Specialized cargo ship types ====
Specialized types of cargo vessels include container ships and bulk carriers (technically tankers of all sizes are cargo ships, although they are routinely thought of as a separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-run-cargo line.

=== Size categories ===
Cargo ships are categorized partly by cargo or shipping capacity (tonnage), partly by weight (deadweight tonnage DWT), and partly by dimensions. Maximum dimensions such as length and width (beam) limit the canal locks a ship can fit in, water depth (draft) is a limitation for canals, shallow straits or harbors and height is a limitation in order to pass under bridges. Common categories include:

* Dry cargo
** Small Handy size, carriers of 20,000–
**Seawaymax, the largest vessel that can traverse the St Lawrence Seaway. These are vessels less than in length, wide, and have a draft less than and a height above the waterline no more than .
** Handy size, carriers of 28,000–
** Handymax, carriers of 40,000–
** Panamax, the largest size that can traverse the original locks of the Panama Canal, a length, a width, and a draft as well as a height limit of . Average deadweight between and , with cargo intake limited to .
** Neopanamax, upgraded Panama locks with length, beam, draft, 
** Capesize, vessels larger than Suezmax and Neopanamax, and must traverse Cape Agulhas and Cape Horn to travel between oceans, dimension: about 170,000 DWT, 290 m long, 45 m beam (wide), 18m draught (under water depth).
** Chinamax, carriers of 380,000– up to draft, beam and length; these dimensions are limited by port infrastructure in China
** Baltimax, limited by the Great Belt. The limit is a draft of 15.4 metres and an air draft of 65 metres (limited by the clearance of the east bridge of the Great Belt Fixed Link). The length can be around 240 m and the width around 42 m. This gives a weight of around 100,000 metric ton.

* Wet cargo
**Aframax, oil tankers between 75,000 and . This is the largest size defined by the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) scheme.
** Q-Max, liquefied natural gas carrier for Qatar exports. A ship of Q-Max size is long and measures wide and high, with a shallow draft of approximately . 
** Suezmax, typically ships of about , maximum dimensions are a beam of , a draft of as well as a height limit of can traverse the Suez Canal
** VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier), supertankers between 150,000 and .
*** Malaccamax, ships with a draft less than that can traverse the Strait of Malacca, typically . 
** ULCC (Ultra Large Crude Carrier), enormous supertankers between 320,000 and 

The TI-class supertanker is an Ultra Large Crude Carrier, with a draft that is deeper than Suezmax, Malaccamax and Neopanamax. This causes Atlantic/Pacific routes to be very long, such as the long voyages south of Cape of Good Hope or south of Cape Horn to transit between Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

Lake freighters built for the Great Lakes in North America differ in design from sea water–going ships because of the difference in wave size and frequency in the lakes. A number of these ships are larger than Seawaymax and cannot leave the lakes and pass to the Atlantic Ocean, since they do not fit the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

== History ==
The earliest records of waterborne activity mention the carriage of items for trade; the evidence of history and archaeology shows the practice to be widespread by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, and as early as the 14th and 15th centuries BC small Mediterranean cargo ships like those of the 50 foot long (15–16 metre) Uluburun ship were carrying 20 tons of exotic cargo; 11 tons of raw copper, jars, glass, ivory, gold, spices, and treasures from Canaan, Greece, Egypt, and Africa. The desire to operate trade routes over longer distances, and throughout more seasons of the year, motivated improvements in ship design during the Middle Ages.

Before the middle of the 19th century, the incidence of piracy resulted in most cargo ships being armed, sometimes quite heavily, as in the case of the Manila galleons and East Indiamen. They were also sometimes escorted by warships.

== Piracy ==

Piracy is still quite common in some waters, particularly in the Malacca Straits, a narrow channel between Indonesia and Singapore / Malaysia, and cargo ships are still commonly targeted. In 2004, the governments of those three nations agreed to provide better protection for the ships passing through the Straits. The waters off Somalia and Nigeria are also prone to piracy, while smaller vessels are also in danger along parts of the South American coasts, Southeast Asian coasts, and near the Caribbean Sea.

==Vessel prefixes==

A category designation appears before the vessel&#x27;s name. A few examples of prefixes for naval ships are &quot;USS&quot; (United States Ship), &quot;HMS&quot; (Her/His Majesty’s Ship), &quot;HMCS&quot; (Her/His Majesty&#x27;s Canadian Ship) and &quot;HTMS&quot; (His Thai Majesty&#x27;s Ship), while a few examples for prefixes for merchant ships are &quot;RMS&quot; (Royal Mail Ship, usually a passenger liner), &quot;MV&quot; (Motor Vessel, powered by diesel), &quot;MT&quot; (Motor Tanker, powered vessel carrying liquids only) &quot;FV&quot; Fishing Vessel and &quot;SS&quot; (Screw Steamer, driven by propellers or screws, often understood to stand for Steamship). &quot;TS&quot;, sometimes found in first position before a merchant ship&#x27;s prefix, denotes that it is a .

==Famous cargo ships==
Famous cargo ships include the 2,710 Liberty ships of World War II, partly based on a British design. Liberty ship sections were prefabricated in locations across the United States and then assembled by shipbuilders in an average of six weeks, with the record being just over four days. These ships allowed the Allies in World War II to replace sunken cargo vessels at a rate greater than the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s U-boats could sink them, and contributed significantly to the war effort, the delivery of supplies, and eventual victory over the Axis powers. Liberty ships were followed by the faster Victory ships. Canada built Park ships and Fort ships to meet the demand for the Allies shipping. The United Kingdom built Empire ships and used US Ocean ships. After the war many of the ships were sold to private companies. The &quot;Ever Given&quot; is a ship that was lodged into the Suez Canal from March 25 to 28, 2021, which caused a halt on maritime trade. The &quot;MV Dali,&quot; which collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, on 26 March 2024, causing a catastrophic structural failure of the bridge that resulted in at least 6 deaths.

== Pollution ==
Due to its low cost, most large cargo vessels are powered by bunker fuel, also known as heavy fuel oil, which contains higher sulphur levels than diesel. This level of pollution is increasing: with bunker fuel consumption at 278 million tonnes per year in 2001, it is projected to be at 500 million tonnes per year in 2020. International standards to dramatically reduce sulphur content in marine fuels and nitrogen oxide emissions have been put in place. Among some of the solutions offered is changing over the fuel intake to clean diesel or marine gas oil, while in restricted waters and cold ironing the ship while it is in port. The process of removing sulphur from the fuel impacts the viscosity and lubricity of the marine gas oil though, which could cause damage in the engine fuel pump. The fuel viscosity can be raised by cooling the fuel down. If the various requirements are enforced, the International Maritime Organization&#x27;s marine fuel requirement will mean a 90% reduction in sulphur oxide emissions; whilst the European Union is planning stricter controls on emissions.

== Environmental impact ==
Cargo ships have been reported to have a possible negative impact on the population of whale sharks. Smithsonian Magazine reported in 2022 that whale sharks, the largest species of fish, have been disappearing mysteriously over the past 75 years, with research pointing to cargo ships and large vessels as the likely culprits. A study involving over 75 researchers highlighted the danger posed to whale sharks by shipping activities in various regions, including Ecuador, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, Oman, Seychelles, and Taiwan.

<text>The NW 39th Street Enclave, also known as &quot;The Strip,&quot; &quot;The Gayborhood,&quot; &quot;May-Penn,&quot; &quot;39th &amp; Penn&quot; or simply &quot;39th Street&quot; is a prominent lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) district in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The area is located along NW 39th Street in the city&#x27;s northwest quadrant, one block west of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Northwest 39th Street Enclave is home to many of Oklahoma&#x27;s most popular gay and lesbian bars and nightclubs, in addition to a number of retail stores, eateries, and apartment complexes catering to Oklahoma City&#x27;s LGBT community. While Oklahoma City&#x27;s openly gay population is relatively average for a city of its size, the NW 39th Street Enclave is widely regarded as the largest gay and lesbian district in the Great Plains and central regions of the United States, and one of the largest in the South.

The NW 39th Street district attracts large numbers of gay and lesbian tourists, particularly on weekends, from elsewhere in Oklahoma and from the surrounding states of Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Texas. The neighborhood is also a popular stopping point for cross-country LGBT travelers.

Most of the district&#x27;s attractions are concentrated around or near the District Hotel (which had a long history as the Habana Inn before being briefly rebranded as the Hotel Habana). This hotel, promoted as &quot;Oklahoma City’s renowned wonderland for adults&quot; and &quot;a multi-venue experience,&quot; features a variety of guest rooms, a lounge bar, nightclub, billiards, darts and two pools, and also promotes a forthcoming restaurant and business center. The hotel, which requires all guests to be 21 years or older to be on its property, hosts various LGBT events and gatherings.

<doc id="786064" wikidata="Q1330018" url="?curid=786064" title="Prevailing winds">
<text>In meteorology, prevailing wind in a region of the Earth&#x27;s surface is a surface wind that blows predominantly from a particular direction. The dominant winds are the trends in direction of wind with the highest speed over a particular point on the Earth&#x27;s surface at any given time. A region&#x27;s prevailing and dominant winds are the result of global patterns of movement in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. In general, winds are predominantly easterly at low latitudes globally. In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds are dominant, and their strength is largely determined by the polar cyclone. In areas where winds tend to be light, the sea breeze-land breeze cycle (powered by differential solar heating and night cooling of sea and land) is the most important cause of the prevailing wind. In areas which have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes dominate the wind pattern. Highly elevated surfaces can induce a thermal low, which then augments the environmental wind flow. Wind direction at any given time is influenced by synoptic-scale and mesoscale weather like pressure systems and fronts. Local wind direction can also be influenced by microscale features like buildings.

Wind roses are tools used to display the history of wind direction and intensity. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction in coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, but the flight of birds is less dependent on it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes.

==Wind rose==
A wind rose is a graphic tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location. Presented in a polar coordinate grid, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions. The length of each spoke around the circle is related to the proportion of the time that the wind blows from each direction. Each concentric circle represents a different proportion, increasing outwards from zero at the center. A wind rose plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind speed ranges. Wind roses typically show 8 or 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions.

==Climatology==
===Trades and their impact===

The trade winds (also called trades) are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics near the Earth&#x27;s equator, equatorward of the subtropical ridge. These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. The trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over world&#x27;s oceans, guiding their path westward. Trade winds also steer African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea, as well as portions of southeast North America.

===Westerlies and their impact===

The westerlies or the prevailing westerlies are the prevailing winds in the middle latitudes (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees latitude), which blow in areas poleward of the high pressure area known as the subtropical ridge in the horse latitudes. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extra-tropical cyclones in this general direction. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, such as when the polar cyclone is strongest, and weakest during the summer when the polar cyclone is weakest and when pressures are higher over the poles.

Together with the trade winds, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as the westerlies lead to the development of strong ocean currents in both hemispheres. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are called the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, within the Southern Hemisphere. The westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.

The westerlies explain why coastal Western North America tends to be wet, especially from Northern Washington to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the Sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture-rich air flowing east from the Pacific Ocean, causing frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast Ranges, and the Cascade, Sierra Nevada, Columbia, and Rocky Mountains causes a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal Western North America in the highest latitude experiences dry summers, despite vast rainfall in the winter.

===Polar easterlies===

The polar easterlies (also known as Polar Hadley cells) are the dry, cold prevailing winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at the North and South Poles towards the low-pressure areas within the westerlies at high latitudes. Like trade winds and unlike the westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Due to the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an outflow of air toward the equator; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.

==Local considerations==

===Sea and land breezes===
In areas where the wind flow is light, sea breezes and land breezes are important factors in a location&#x27;s prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater specific heat. The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land&#x27;s surface. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it. The warm air is less dense and so it rises. This rising air over the land lowers the sea level pressure by about 0.2%. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards the land into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast.

The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an off-shore wind of exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop. At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean due to differences in their specific heat values, which forces the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. If the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.

===Circulation in elevated regions===

Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any lows which would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind can change direction and accelerate parallel to the wind obstruction. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow is more severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Wind direction changes due to the contour of the land. If there is a pass in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed due to the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes.

Daytime heating and nighttime cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night variations in the airflow, similar to the relationship between sea breeze and land breeze. At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. This is known a mountain breeze. If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the mountain breeze will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.

==Effect on precipitation==
Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains. It is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see foehn wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.

In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.

==Effect on nature==
Insects are swept along by the prevailing winds, while birds follow their own course. As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. In the Great Plains, wind erosion of agricultural land is a significant problem, and is mainly driven by the prevailing wind. Because of this, wind barrier strips have been developed to minimize this type of erosion. The strips can be in the form of soil ridges, crop strips, crops rows, or trees which act as wind breaks. They are oriented perpendicular to the wind in order to be most effective. In regions with minimal vegetation, such as coastal and desert areas, transverse sand dunes orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, while longitudinal dunes orient themselves parallel to the prevailing winds.

<text>Zuleika Dobson, full title Zuleika Dobson, or, an Oxford love story, is the only novel by English essayist Max Beerbohm, a satire of undergraduate life at Oxford published in 1911. It includes the famous line &quot;Death cancels all engagements&quot; and presents a corrosive view of Edwardian Oxford.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Zuleika Dobson&quot; 59th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

The book largely employs a third-person narrator limited to the character of Zuleika (pronounced &quot;Zu-lee-ka&quot;), then shifting to that of the Duke, then halfway through the novel suddenly becoming a first-person narrator who claims inspiration from the Greek Muse Clio, with her all-seeing narrative perspective provided by Zeus. This allows the narrator to also see the ghosts of notable historical visitors to Oxford, who are present but otherwise invisible to the human characters at certain times in the novel, adding an element of the supernatural.

Robert Mighall in his Afterword to the New Centenary Edition of &quot;Zuleika&quot; (Collector&#x27;s Library, 2011), writes: &quot;Zuleika is of the future ... [Beerbohm] anticipates an all-too-familiar feature of the contemporary scene: the D-list talent afforded A-list media attention.&quot;

Beerbohm began writing the book in 1898, finishing in 1910, with Heinemann publishing it on 26 October 1911. He saw it not as a novel, but rather as &quot;the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative idea.&quot; Sydney Castle Roberts wrote a parody, &quot;Zuleika in Cambridge&quot; (1941).

==Plot==
Zuleika Dobson—&quot;though not strictly beautiful&quot;—is a devastatingly attractive young woman of the Edwardian era, a true femme fatale, who is a prestidigitator by profession, formerly a governess. Zuleika&#x27;s current occupation (though, more importantly, perhaps, her enrapturing beauty) has made her something of a small-time celebrity and she manages to gain entrance to the privileged, all-male domain of Oxford University because her grandfather is the Warden of Judas College (based on Merton College, Beerbohm&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;). There, she falls in love for the first time in her life with the Duke of Dorset, a snobbish, emotionally detached student who—frustrated with the lack of control over his feelings when he sees her—is forced to admit that she too is his first love, impulsively proposing to her. As she feels that she cannot love anyone unless he is impervious to her charms, however, she rejects all her suitors, doing the same with the astonished Duke. The Duke quickly discovers that Noaks, another Oxford student, also claims to have fallen in love with her, without ever having even interacted with her. Apparently, men immediately fall in love with her upon seeing her. As the first to have his love reciprocated by her (for however brief a time) the Duke decides that he will commit suicide to symbolise his passion for Zuleika and in hopes that he will raise awareness in her of the terrible power of her bewitching allure, as she innocently goes on crushing men&#x27;s affections.

Zuleika is able to interrupt the Duke&#x27;s first suicide attempt from a river boat, but seems to have a romanticised view of men dying for her, and does not oppose the notion of his suicide altogether. The Duke, instead pledging to kill himself the next day—which Zuleika more or less permits—has dinner that night with his social club where the other members also affirm their love for Zuleika. Upon telling them of his plan to die, the others unexpectedly agree also to commit suicide for Zuleika. This idea soon reaches the minds of all Oxford undergraduates, who inevitably fall in love with Zuleika upon first sight.

The Duke eventually decides that the only way he can stop all the undergraduates from killing themselves is by not committing suicide himself, hoping they will follow his example. By an ancient tradition, on the eve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the battlements of Tankerton Hall, the family seat; the owls remain there hooting through the night and at dawn they fly away to an unknown place. After debating whether to follow through with his suicide, while seeming to decide at last to embrace his life as just as valuable as Zuleika&#x27;s, the Duke receives a telegram from his butler at Tankerton, reporting the portentous return of the owls. The Duke promptly interprets the omen as a sign that the gods have decreed his doom. He proudly tells Zuleika that he will still die, but no longer for her; she agrees as long as he makes it appear that he is dying for her by shouting her name as he jumps into the river. Later the same day, a thunderstorm overwhelms the Eights Week boat races while the Duke drowns himself in the River Isis, wearing the robes of a Knight of the Garter. Every fellow undergraduate, except one, promptly follows suit.

All of the Oxford undergraduates now dead, including, with some delay, the cowardly Noaks, Zuleika discusses the ordeal with her grandfather, who reveals that he too was enamoured by all when he was her age. While Oxford&#x27;s academic staff barely notice that nearly all of their undergraduates have vanished, Zuleika decides to order a train for the next morning... bound for Cambridge.

<text>Anna Catherine Stanley (née Rowberry, born 31 March 1976 in Christchurch, New Zealand) is a New Zealand netballer, who captained the national team (the Silver Ferns), to win the 2003 Netball World Championships in Jamaica.

She led the Silver Ferns to a drought-breaking series win over Australia (the first since 1989) in the winter of 2004, and played for the Auckland Diamonds in the National Bank Cup national league in 2004 and 2005.

==Early life==
The daughter of a former New Zealand player, Stanley had not played senior provincial netball when she was sent to her international debut against Jamaica in 1994. Her career dipped to its lowest point when sidelined by selectors for 18 months, but she was recalled in 2002.

Stanley is renowned in netball circles as an outstanding athlete and for her speed through court and trademark bullet pass.

==Career==
Stanley represented Otago, Canterbury and Auckland in New Zealand&#x27;s top netball league. In 2004, she suffered a knee injury during the Silver Ferns&#x27; clean sweep series win over arch-rivals Australia. In 2005, after several months of rehabilitation, she returned to the court for the Auckland Diamonds. She returned to the Silver Ferns in October of that year, and was a member of the Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning team of March 2006.

Only a few weeks into the 2006 National Bank Cup season, she announced that she was pregnant and would be retiring from netball to concentrate on her family life, thus ending a fluctuating but successful career on the court. Stanley was named in the Waikato-Bay of Plenty Magic squad in New Zealand&#x27;s top netball league in 2007, however she did not play this season for the team in the league.

Instead Stanley devoted time to motherhood, and in 2007 became an Ambassador for Rett New Zealand, an organisation to assist children and their families that suffer from Rett syndrome. In 2008 with the start of the ANZ Championship, Stanley has been a television presenter and netball commentator with Sky Sports. She also co-hosts the weekly netball magazine style show &quot;On Court&quot; with Kathryn Harby-Williams and Tania Dalton. She finished her international career with 91 caps.

==Personal life==
Stanley is married to medical surgeon and former Auckland and All Black rugby union player, Jeremy Stanley. They have a daughter, Jaya and a son, Nico and on 20 January 2011, eight days after their baby&#x27;s due date, they became parents to Zac, who weighed in at . While pregnant with their first child, Jaya, Stanley and her husband relocated from her Mount Maunganui base to Whangarei.

==Honours==
Anna Stanley was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to netball in the 2004 New Year Honours.

<text>USS &quot;Beale&quot; (DD-40), a served in the United States Navy during World War I and later with the United States Coast Guard. She was the first ship of the Navy to be named for Edward Fitzgerald Beale.

&quot;Beale&quot; was launched on 30 April 1912 and was commissioned on 30 August 1912. She served in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea until 1915 and with the Atlantic Fleet from 1916 until being decommissioned in 1919. She was transferred to the United States Coast Guard in 1924. From 1924 to 1930 she operated to prevent rum-runners from illegally bringing alcoholic beverages into the United States. &quot;Beale&quot; was scrapped in 1934.

==World War I==

&quot;Beale&quot; was launched on 30 April 1912 by William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company of Philadelphia. She was sponsored by Mrs. John R. McLean, daughter of Lieutenant Beale. She was commissioned on 30 August 1912.

&quot;Beale&quot; joined the 5th Group, Torpedo Flotilla of the Atlantic Fleet, and cruised along the Atlantic coast and in Mexican and Caribbean waters until placed in reserve on 13 December 1915. She was reactivated with a reduced crew on 5 January 1916 and served on Neutrality Patrol along the Atlantic coast until placed in full commission on 22 March 1917. She joined the Atlantic Destroyer Force and arrived at Queenstown, Ireland on 5 February 1918.

&quot;Beale&quot; operated out of Queenstown on convoy and patrol duty until the end of World War I. She returned to the United States in December 1918 and served with the Atlantic Fleet until placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 October 1919.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Beale&quot; was reactivated in 1924 and transferred to the Coast Guard on 28 April 1924 for use in enforcing the Volstead Act, which prohibited the sale or import of alcoholic beverages in the United States. In Coast Guard service she was assigned hull number CG-9. She was returned to the Navy on 18 October 1930 and was laid up at Philadelphia Navy Yard until she was scrapped in 1934.

<doc id="786191" wikidata="Q312410" url="?curid=786191" title="Epicharmus of Kos">
<text>Epicharmus of [[Kos]] or Epicharmus Comicus or Epicharmus Comicus [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusanus]] (), thought to have lived between c. 550 and c. 460 BC, was a Greek dramatist and philosopher who is often credited with being one of the first comedic writers, having originated the Doric or Sicilian comedic form.

==Literary evidence==
Most of the information about Epicharmus comes from the writings of Athenaeus, &quot;Suda&quot; and Diogenes Laërtius, although fragments and comments come up in a host of other ancient authors as well. The standard edition of his fragments was made by Kaibel (1890) to which there has been various additions and emendments. There have also been some papyrus finds of longer sections of text, but these are often so full of holes that it is difficult to make sense of them. Plato mentions Epicharmus in his dialogue &quot;Gorgias&quot; and in &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. In the latter, Socrates refers to Epicharmus as &quot;the prince of Comedy&quot;, Homer as &quot;the prince of Tragedy&quot;, and both as &quot;great masters of either kind of poetry&quot;. Aristotle (&quot;Poetics&quot; 5.1449b5) writes that he and Phormis invented comic plots (μῦθοι, &quot;muthoi&quot;).

The 12th-century philosopher Constantine of Nicaea cites Epicharmus.

==Life==
All of his biographical information should be treated as suspect. Epicharmus&#x27; birthplace is not known, but late and fairly unreliable ancient commentators suggest a number of alternatives. The &quot;Suda&quot; (E 2766) records that he was either Syracusan by birth or from the Sikanian city of Krastos. Diogenes Laërtius (VIII 78) records that Epicharmus was born in Astypalea, the ancient capital of Kos on the Bay of Kamari, near modern-day Kefalos. Diogenes Laërtius also records that Epicharmus&#x27; father was the prominent physician Helothales, who moved the family to Megara in Sicily, when Epicharmus was just a few months old. Although raised according to the Asclepiad tradition of his father, as an adult Epicharmus became a follower of Pythagoras.

It is most likely that sometime after 484 BC, he lived in Syracuse, Magna Graecia, and worked as a poet for the tyrants Gelo and Hiero I. The subject matter of his poetry covered a broad range, from exhortations against intoxication and laziness to such unorthodox topics as mythological burlesque, but he also wrote on philosophy, medicine, natural science, linguistics, and ethics. Among many other philosophical and moral lessons, Epicharmus taught that the continuous exercise of virtue could overcome heredity, so that anyone had the potential to be a good person regardless of birth. He died in his 90s (according to a statement in Lucian, he died at ninety-seven).

Diogenes Laërtius records that there was a bronze statue dedicated to him in Syracuse, by the inhabitants, for which Theocritus composed the following inscription:As the bright sun excels the other stars,&quot;&quot;As the sea far exceeds the river streams:&quot;&quot;So does sage Epicharmus men surpass,&quot;&quot;Whom hospitable Syracuse has crowned.Theocritus&#x27; Epigram 18 (AP IX 60; Kassel and Austin Test. 18) was written in his honour.

The cosmopolitan scientist and traveler Alexander von Humboldt turned Epicharmus into the protagonist of the only literary text he ever published; it appeared 1795 in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s journal Horen under the title &quot;Die Lebenskraft oder der Rhodische Genius&quot; [&quot;The Vital Force or the Rhodian Genius&quot;]. Epicharmos figures here as a natural philosopher and interpreter of art.

==Works==
Epicharmus wrote between thirty-five and fifty-two comedies, though many have been lost or exist only in fragments. Along with his contemporary Phormis, he was alternately praised and denounced for ridiculing the great mythical heroes. At the time it would have been dangerous to present comedies in Syracuse like those of the Athenian stage, in which attacks were made upon the authorities. Accordingly, the comedies of Epicharmus are calculated not to give offence to the ruler. They are either mythological travesties or character comedies.

His two most famous works were &quot;Agrōstīnos&quot; (&quot;The Country-Dweller,&quot; or &quot;Clodhopper&quot;), which dealt humorously with the rustic lifestyle, and &quot;Hebes Gamos&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of Hebe&quot;), in which Heracles was portrayed as a glutton. He also depicted Odysseus as an unheroic figure of burlesque by parodying the Homeric image for comic effect in his &quot;Odysseùs Autómolos&quot; (Ulysses the Deserter). Additional works include

Reproducing a mid-4th century BC accusation from Alcimus, Diogenes Laërtius in his &quot;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&quot; conserves a late opinion that Plato plagiarized several of Epicharmus&#x27;s ideas. &quot;[H]e [Plato] derived great assistance from Epicharmus the Comic poet, for he transcribed a great deal from him, as Alcimus says in the essays dedicated to Amyntas [of Heraclea]...&quot; Laërtius then lists, in , the several ways that Plato &quot;employs the words of Epicharmus.&quot; There were also some works believed by the ancients to have been spuriously attributed to him, but actually written by the forger Axiopistus.

==Quotations==
*&quot;A mortal should think mortal thoughts, not immortal thoughts.&quot;
*&quot;The best thing a man can have, in my view, is health.&quot;
*&quot;The hand washes the hand: give something and you may get something.&quot;
*&quot;Then what is the nature of men? Blown-up bladders!&quot;
*&quot;Don&#x27;t forget to exercise incredulity; for it is the sinews of the soul.&quot;

<text>The Mocambo was a nightclub in West Hollywood, California, at 8588 Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip. It was owned by Charlie Morrison and Felix Young.

==History==
The Mocambo opened on January 3, 1941, and it became an immediate success. The club&#x27;s Latin American-themed decor was designed by Tony Duquette and cost $100,000 (). Along the walls were glass cages holding live cockatoos, macaws, seagulls, pigeons, and parrots. With big band music, the club became one of the most popular dance-till-dawn spots in town. On any given night, one might find the room filled with the leading men and women of the motion picture industry. In 1943, when Frank Sinatra became a solo act, he made his Los Angeles debut at the Mocambo.

On March 15, 1955, Ella Fitzgerald opened at the Mocambo, after Marilyn Monroe lobbied the owner for the booking. The booking was instrumental in Fitzgerald&#x27;s career. The incident was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer in 2005. It has been widely reported that Fitzgerald was the first Black performer to play the Mocambo, following Monroe&#x27;s intervention, but this is not true. African-American singers Herb Jeffries, Eartha Kitt, and Joyce Bryant all played the Mocambo in 1953, according to stories published at the time in &quot;Jet&quot; magazine.

The club&#x27;s main stage was replicated on the TV series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as the &quot;Tropicana&quot; Club. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were frequent guests at the Mocambo and were close friends of Charlie Morrison.

The Mocambo was also parodied mercilessly in the 1947 Bugs Bunny cartoon, &quot;Slick Hare&quot;. According to a commentary track on the DVD with this cartoon, the animators managed to get into the kitchen and drew the kitchen exactly as they saw it, complete with dripping grease on the refrigerator and vegetables lying around the ground.

Early in 1957, club operator and co-owner Charlie Morrison died at his Beverly Hills, California, home. The Mocambo remained in business for one final year, before closing its doors on June 30, 1958. The building was then sold, reopened as a supper club called The Cloister, and eventually demolished.

<text>Alfonso Gagliano (; 25 January 1942 – 12 December 2020) was a Canadian accountant and politician.

==Early life and family==
Born in Siculiana, Italy, Gagliano immigrated to Montreal in 1958. His political career began in 1977 when he ran for a seat on the then Jérôme-LeRoyer school board, which no longer exists and used to cover the East End of Montreal Island.

In 1965, Gagliano married Ersilia Gidaro and with her bore three children; Vincenzo, Maria and Immacolata.

==Political career==
In the 1984 federal election, he ran for Parliament for Saint-Léonard—Anjou narrowly defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate. It was one of the few ridings that the Liberals retained, as they were swept out of power in a massive Conservative landslide. He was re-elected in the 1988 and 1993 elections representing Saint-Léonard, and in the 1997 and 2000 elections representing Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel.

From 1996 to 2002, he served in various cabinet posts including Minister of Labour, Deputy House leader and the Minister responsible for Communications Canada, Canada Post, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Royal Canadian Mint and Canada Lands Company Ltd. His most controversial positions were as Minister of Public Works and Government Services and as political minister for Quebec.

Following his career as a cabinet minister, Gagliano was appointed as the Canadian ambassador to Denmark after having been rejected by the Vatican for a similar posting. However, he was dismissed from this position on February 10, 2004 by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham, amidst widespread speculation that during his time as public works minister he was actively involved in the sponsorship scandal.

==Aftermath==
On May 27, 2004, Gagliano filed a more than $4.5-million lawsuit against Prime Minister Paul Martin and the government. The suit accused the defendants of deliberately attacking Gagliano&#x27;s reputation and alleged that he was illegally and unjustly fired. He sought compensation for wrongful dismissal, damage to his reputation and lost income. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed.

Justice John Gomery&#x27;s initial report on the sponsorship scandal places much of the blame on Gagliano, making him the highest ranking Liberal to be charged with deliberate dishonesty, rather than negligence. Following the initial report, Paul Martin expelled him from the Liberal Party for life.

On November 17, 2004, an article in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; alleged that Gagliano was associated with the Bonanno crime family of New York City. In the article, former capo Frank Lino, turned informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, is quoted as saying Gagliano was first introduced to him during a meeting with other mob members in Montreal in the early 1990s. Lino also stated that Gagliano was a made man of the Mafia. It was not the first time Gagliano&#x27;s name has been linked to organized crime. In April 1994, &quot;La Presse&quot; reported that Gagliano was the accountant for Agostino Cuntrera, cousin of cocaine baron Alfonso Caruana, also a native of Siculiana, who was convicted in the gangland slaying of Paolo Violi in Montreal in 1978. Gagliano denied any links to the Mafia. Since August 2008, Gagliano resided with his family on a vineyard in Dunham, Quebec he purchased.

In September 2006, he argued that Liberal leadership candidate Joe Volpe was the victim of the same kind of anti-Italian sentiment that ended his own political career.

<text>The Bass Highway is a highway in Tasmania, Australia. It connects the three cities across the north of the state – Burnie, Devonport and Launceston. The road was named due to its proximity to the Bass Strait. It is a part of the National Highway, designated as National Highway 1, together with the Midland and Brooker highways in Tasmania.

The highway passes through or past the following localities:

*[[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]
* Prospect and other Launceston suburbs
* Hadspen
* Carrick
* Hagley
* Westbury
* Exton
*Deloraine
* Elizabeth Town
* Sassafras
* Latrobe
*[[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]]
* Forth
* Ulverstone
* Penguin
*[[Burnie]]

From here, the highway ceases to be part of the National Highway, but continues as the Bass Highway (A2) through the following towns:

* Somerset
* Wynyard
* Smithton
* Marrawah

==Upgrades==
The name &quot;Bass Highway&quot; was in use by 1938. Since the mid-1970s the highway has undergone significant upgrades that have included bypasses and deviations, duplications and grade separations, particularly between Burnie and Launceston. On 30 March 1977, &#x27;stage A&#x27; of the &#x27;Burnie Highway System&#x27; was opened to traffic. This stage connected the Bass Highway east of the town with Alexander Street by an elevated roadway over the port access road and rail lines. Shortly after, on 19 April 1977, the bypass of Devonport was completed with the opening of the final section between Middle Road, Devonport and Don, referred to in that year&#x27;s Main Roads Annual Report as the &#x27;Devonport to Don Freeway&#x27;. This section was an extension of the earlier Victoria Bridge project. Three years later, the Ulverstone bypass was completed and opened to traffic in August 1980. The duplication of the highway from Wivenhoe, east of Burnie, to Chasm Creek was completed during the 1983–84 financial year, and was followed in May 1984 with the opening of 500 metres of &#x27;stage B&#x27; of the Burnie Highway System. This section duplicated the highway along North Terrace. In September 1986, all four lanes over the complete length of &#x27;stage B&#x27; of the &#x27;Burnie Expressway&#x27; (&#x27;Burnie Highway System&#x27;) were brought into operation.
Throughout 1986 and 1987, sections of the highway were progressively duplicated and opened to traffic between Don (Devonport) and the Forth River, with the last section completed in June 1987. This was followed by completion of duplication between Forth River and Ulverstone in late 1987. In 1988, at the eastern terminus of the Bass Highway, a new alignment was opened to connect directly to the then new Launceston Southern Outlet, which itself had opened to traffic in 1985. Known as the Prospect bypass, this alignment was opened to traffic on 23 January 1988. 
West of Burnie, the Smithton bypass was opened to traffic in May 1988. The Deloraine Bypass was opened on 8 June 1990. The project was carried out over five years and cost a total of A$19 million. The bypass opening was performed by the Federal and State ministers for Land Transport and Roads and Transport respectively.

Other bypasses have included Carrick and Hadspen in the late 1980s and the longest stretch of highway, the Hagley–Westbury bypass, which was completed in 2001. The &#x27;old&#x27; highway alignment between Deloraine and Hadspen is now known as Meander Valley Road, and is promoted as a tourist route.

The Bass Highway is, like Bass Strait, named for explorer George Bass.

<doc id="786283" wikidata="Q276170" url="?curid=786283" title="Alejandro Sanz">
<text>Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro, better known as Alejandro Sanz (; born 18 December 1968), is a Spanish musician, singer and composer. He has won 22 Latin Grammy Awards and four Grammy Awards. He has received the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times. The singer is notable for his flamenco-influenced ballads, and has also experimented with several other genres including pop, rock, funk, R&amp;B and jazz.

Born in Madrid to parents from Andalusia, Sanz began playing guitar at age seven, taking influence from his family&#x27;s flamenco roots. Sanz released his debut album at age nineteen, although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release, &quot;Viviendo Deprisa&quot; (1991). His next two records, &quot;Si Tú Me Miras&quot; (1993) and &quot;3&quot; (1995) also fared well commercially, but it was his 1997 breakthrough album &quot;Más&quot; that garnered international success. &quot;El Alma al Aire&quot; followed in 2000, selling more than a million copies in its first week. In 2002, he became the first Spanish artist to record an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album.

His collaboration with Shakira on the 2005 single &quot;La Tortura&quot; reached number one on several charts worldwide. He experimented with more diverse styles of music with the albums &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot; (2003) and &quot;El Tren de los Momentos&quot; (2006), while his 2009 release, &quot;Paraíso Express&quot; served as a return to form for the musician. Sanz signed to Universal Music Group in 2011 and released his tenth studio album, &quot;La Música No Se Toca&quot;, in 2012, followed by &quot;Sirope&quot; in 2015.

==Early life==
Sanz was born on 18 December 1968, the youngest son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez. He grew up in the neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid. Sanz recalled that &quot;Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was a bit like the group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. That kept me out of a lot of trouble.&quot; Sanz&#x27;s father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument. He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.

He was exposed to traditional flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents&#x27; native Andalusia in southern Spain. Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, &quot;Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. If you lose the rhythm, they toss you out with, &#x27;You&#x27;re no good, boy!&#x27; They&#x27;re very strict and very cruel. But it&#x27;s also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else.&quot; He felt that he could not compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a &quot;lifestyle&quot; better suited to others.

==Recording career==

===1989–96: First four albums===
As a teenager, Sanz performed in various venues in his hometown. He became acquainted with Miguel Ángel Arenas, a music industry executive who had signed several popular Spanish groups such as Mecano. Arenas helped Sanz find work, eventually leading to a record deal with the Spanish label Hispavox. In 1989 Sanz released his debut album, &quot;Los Chulos Son Pa&#x27; Cuidarlos&quot; under the name of Alejandro Magno (Spanish for &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;). The record, which fused techno and flamenco, was met with critical and commercial indifference, and today Sanz views the record to be &quot;insignificant&quot;. However, the album is now considered to be a collector&#x27;s item. In an attempt to promote &quot;Los Chulos Son Pa&#x27; Cuidarlos&quot;, he performed at strip clubs, playing short sets between acts. This proved to be unsuccessful and Sanz took a break from music, choosing to study business administration. He also took a job at a recording studio in which he wrote material for other artists. He persuaded Arenas to send demos of his songs to record companies, which led to being signed by Warner Music Latina. At this time, he began performing under his current name.

Sanz&#x27;s rise to fame began in 1991, when he released his first album from Warner, &quot;Viviendo Deprisa&quot;. The record and the songs &quot;Pisando Fuerte&quot; and &quot;Se le Apagó la Luz&quot; helped him gain a dedicated fan base in Spain. In 1993, he released &quot;Si Tú Me Miras&quot; shortly followed by a live album, titled &quot;Básico&quot;. That same year, he recorded a song entitled &quot;Mi Primera Canción&quot; with flamenco pioneer Paco de Lucía, whom Sanz idolized as a child. He released his third studio album since changing his stage name, &quot;3&quot;, in 1995. In addition to Spanish, &quot;3&quot; was also released in Italian and Portuguese. &quot;La Fuerza del Corazón&quot;, the first single released from &quot;3&quot;, was his first song to chart internationally. All three albums proved to be successful, reaching multi-platinum status in Spain.

===1997–2002: &quot;Más&quot;, &quot;El Alma al Aire&quot;, and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;===

Sanz spent two years in Milan, Italy to work on a follow-up for &quot;3&quot;. For the album, he wished to create a &quot;true fusion&quot; of many different sounds, and began studying the saxophone and piano in addition to guitar. In 1997, Sanz released his fifth studio album, &quot;Más&quot;, a record containing ballads strongly influenced by flamenco, pop, and tropical rhythms. Driven by the singles &quot;Corazón Partío&quot;, &quot;Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?&quot;, &quot;Amiga Mía&quot;, &quot;Aquello Que Me Diste&quot;, and &quot;Siempre Es de Noche&quot;, &quot;Más&quot; sold more than two million copies in Spain and was certified 22× Platinum in the country, making it the best-selling album in Spanish history. The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Albums chart for 74 weeks, and one year after the record&#x27;s release, Sanz was granted an Ondas Award for Best Song for &quot;Corazón Partío&quot;. According to David Cazares of the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot;, the album &quot;made Sanz an international star on the strength of the pop-salsa hit &#x27;Corazón Partío&#x27;, a song on the lips of fans from Spain to Cuba and the United States.&quot; Following the success of the album, Sanz began touring in United States for the first time.

His fifth album, &quot;El Alma al Aire&quot;, released 26 September 2000, featured Sanz exploring a wider array of musical genres, including jazz, R&amp;B, soul and tango. In Spain, the album sold more than one million copies in the first week, breaking the record of one million copies sold in four months, also set by Sanz with his previous album, &quot;Más&quot;. At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards, Sanz walked away with four awards: Best Pop Male Vocal Album and Album of the Year for &quot;El Alma al Aire&quot;, and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the title track from the album. Later that year, &quot;El Alma al Aire&quot; was released in a special edition including Sanz&#x27;s duets with Irish band The Corrs. In October 2001, Sanz collaborated with Michael Jackson and various other artists on the Spanish version of the charity single &quot;What More Can I Give&quot;, which benefited the victims of the September 11 attacks.

In 2002, Sanz recorded &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, Florida. He was the first Spanish artist to record and release an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album. For Sanz, the recording of the album &quot;changed the way I do my music. It was a rediscovery of how to perform, and also how to record, music with live musicians. That was the spirit of the music in its pure form, though [it is ironic] that the more people who are playing, the more simple it is.&quot; With the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, he garnered three Latin Grammy Awards (Album of the Year, Recording of the Year and Song of the Year for &quot;Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte&quot;). At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Sanz performed &quot;Quisiera Ser&quot; as a duet with Destiny&#x27;s Child, with both Spanish lyrics and English lyric adaptation &quot;I&#x27;d Like To Be Your Laughter&quot;.

===2003–07: &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot; and &quot;El Tren de los Momentos&quot;===
On 2 September 2003, Sanz released his sixth studio album, &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot;. On this record, Sanz took a more political approach than he had on previous releases. The song &quot;Sandy a Orilla do Mundo&quot; discusses oil spills on the Spanish coast, while &quot;Labana&quot; tells the story of people fleeing from Cuba on makeshift rafts. The album won four awards at the 2004 Latin Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Sanz was unable to attend the event and his awards were accepted by presenters and colleagues. Also in 2004, he became the first Spanish musician to give a lecture at Harvard University, speaking about Hispanic culture at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
In 2005, Sanz collaborated with Shakira on her song &quot;La Tortura&quot;. Co-written by Sanz, the song became an international hit, breaking the record for the most weeks at the number one spot on the Hot Latin Songs chart. The song exposed Sanz to a more diverse audience, and helped build anticipation for his next release. The first single from the album &quot;El Tren de los Momentos&quot;, &quot;A la Primera Persona&quot;, became his first song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 100 on the chart. The record was also noted for its guest appearances, which featured Shakira, Juanes, Alex González of Maná, and Residente of Calle 13.

In the spring of 2007, Sanz suffered a mental breakdown and took two months off in the middle of a world tour at the request of his doctor. The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life, including the death of his father in 2005, his separation with Mexican model and actress Jaydy Michel, and his announcement that he had a three-year-old son outside of his marriage with Michel. He commented on the situation, saying &quot;You have to put things in perspective. It was stress, something that had never affected me, but this time, yes, it did. So I had to pay. A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely.&quot; Sanz spent time in therapy, a time which &quot;helped [him] a lot&quot; and gave him &quot;more power&quot; to perform.

In a press conference in late 2007, he criticized Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, calling him &quot;undemocratic&quot; in the wake of a petition made by Venezuelan citizens to prevent Chávez from running for re-election. Sanz further stated &quot;If they gave me 3 million signatures to stop singing, I would stop singing immediately.&quot; Supporters of Chávez subsequently gathered 230,000 signatures in response to Sanz&#x27; comments.

===2008–2012: &quot;Paraíso Express&quot; and &quot;La Música no se Toca&quot;===

To promote his new record, &quot;Paraíso Express&quot;, Sanz started a campaign in which fans could create a video about their definition of paradise and upload it to his YouTube channel. Artists such as Shakira, Laura Pausini and Paulina Rubio also participated. On 10 November 2009, Sanz released &quot;Paraíso Express&quot;. This record was described as a return to form for Sanz, focusing more on melody as opposed to the experimentation he pursued on his previous two albums. He commented that &quot;On this album, I first composed the melody and then the lyrics. It is more of a rock album than my past releases, with more elegant and positive lyrics and a happier and more rhythmic spirit.&quot; The bilingual single &quot;Looking for Paradise&quot; featuring Alicia Keys reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart. At the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards, the album was nominated Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Album, while the single &quot;Desde Cuándo&quot; received both Record and Song of the Year nominations.

On 15 February 2011, Sanz announced that he would be signing with Universal Music Group after twenty years with Warner. In the same year, Sanz received the Latin Heritage Award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in recognition of his contributions to Latin music. On 2 September 2012, the singer unveiled the official artwork of his upcoming ninth studio album, &quot;La Música No Se Toca&quot; on his official site. Sanz released &quot;La Música No Se Toca&quot;, featuring the single &quot;No Me Compares&quot; and based on the opening theme song in the telenovela &quot;Amores Verdaderos&quot;, on 25 September 2012. On 21 August 2012, Sanz released his new single &quot;Irrepetível (Me Sumerjo)&quot;, a duet with Brazilian singer-songwriter Ana Carolina. The song is a Portuguese-Spanish song and it&#x27;s only available in Brazil&#x27;s iTunes. On 17 September, he released the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Se Vende&quot;. In 2013, Sanz was recognized as the Pop Male Artist of the Year and was the recipient of the Excellence Award at the 26th Lo Nuestro Awards for his achievements in the music industry.

===2013–present: &quot;Sirope&quot; and &quot;#ElDisco&quot;===
On 6 November 2013, Sanz received an honorary doctor of music degree from Berklee College of Music. &quot;It is a great honor for me to receive this doctorate degree from one of the most prestigious music schools in the world,&quot; Sanz said of the Berklee recognition. &quot;I will continue to work every day of my life to deserve this honor.&quot; Sanz released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Sirope&quot;, featuring the single &quot;A Que No Me Dejas&quot;, a collaboration with Alejandro Fernandez and used as the opening theme song in the telenovela &quot;A Que No Me Dejas&quot;, on 4 May 2015. The album took a year and one month to record, and features an &quot;eclectic sound&quot; in Sanz&#x27;s words, containing elements of flamenco, R&amp;B, and folk music. He worked with producer Sebastian Krys, who helped him &quot;enrich what was there but [not lose] the essence&quot; of the songs. In November 2017, Alejandro Sanz was honored as the Latin Recording Academy&#x27;s Person of the Year.

In April 2019, he released his album &quot;ElDisco&quot;. The album was recorded in Miami and features collaborations Camila Cabello, Nicky Jam, Residente, and Catalan singer-songwriter Judit Neddermann. In May 2020, Sanz announced the new dates for his La Gira tour, which was originally slated to begin in June 2020 but was rescheduled to June 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour will begin on 12 June 2021, in Valencia.

In July 2021, he was one of several artists singing &quot;Imagine&quot; as a part of the 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, representing Europe. On 29 October 2020, Sanz appeared alongside Argentine singer TINI on &quot;Un Beso en Madrid&quot;, the eighth single from her third album &quot;Tini Tini Tini&quot;.

==Musical style==
Early in his career, Sanz&#x27; music generally consisted of romantic ballads. However, in the late 1990s, his collaborations with other artists greatly expanded his musical style. On &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot;, he experimented with rock, salsa, and hip hop. While recording the album, Sanz noted that he often entered the studio with a rough idea for a song and the guest artists would &quot;contaminate it with their rhythms...in a good way.&quot; &quot;El Tren de los Momentos&quot; continued this pattern of musical experimentation, featuring diverse genres such as funk, jazz, and country. Despite this, Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic described his musical evolution by saying &quot;Even as Sanz broadened his style over the years, he never ventured far from his strength: romantic songs, generally ballads, tinged with flamenco and sung wholeheartedly with his distinct voice.&quot;

Sanz is known for his distinctive raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence. His song &quot;Sí, He Cantado Mal&quot; (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot; references this, with Sanz saying &quot;I&#x27;m laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things. Sometimes, I&#x27;m harder on myself than any music critic can be. I&#x27;m laughing at that.&quot; Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio, referring to himself as a &quot;heavy metal radical&quot;. He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style, where &quot;Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the cajón, knows how to sing. When the family comes together we start to sing. In a way it&#x27;s not just music, it&#x27;s culture.&quot;

==Personal life==

Sanz married Mexican fashion model and actress Jaydy Michel in Bali on 30 December 1999, but this marriage was never legally recognized in either of their home countries. Sanz felt that having a legally recognized marriage was unnecessary: &quot;My wife is my wife and I am her husband. For me, that has enough validity...I am married with the heart.&quot; Their daughter, Manuela Sánchez Michel, was born on 28 July 2001. The couple separated in 2005. Sanz later had a son named Alexander with Valeria Rivera, a Puerto Rican fashion designer.

Sanz married his former assistant, Raquel Perera, on 23 May 2012, in a private ceremony held in Sabadell, Barcelona. They have two children: a son, Dylan, born in 2011 in New York, and a daughter, Alma, born in 2014 in Madrid. The couple separated in July 2019.

The late Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía was the godfather of Sanz&#x27;s son, and Sanz and his wife are godparents to David Bisbal&#x27;s daughter, Ella.

In addition to music, Sanz enjoys painting, which he often does while trying to create ideas for new songs. He explains that painting &quot;teaches you that taking risks rarely leads to failure. In fact, from the moment you assume a risk, you have succeeded.&quot;

In 2016, Sanz gave an interview to a women&#x27;s magazine, where he shared his support for efforts taken against violence against women saying that the man who &quot;beats a woman, beats the whole humanity&quot;. He also wore make-up in an expression of support for women.

In January 2019, Sanz expressed support for Juan Guaidó during the Venezuelan presidential crisis during a livestreamed Instagram interview. During the interview, Sanz recognized Guaidó as interim President of Venezuela.

In October 2021, Sanz had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame inaugurated corresponding to the Recording category. The ceremony took place at 1750 Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building. He was accompanied by his partner, Cuban artist Rachel Valdés, who he mentioned in his speech: &quot;To Rachel, a woman whose hands hold the dreams of my heart. I love you very much&quot;.

<text>Hollywood Screen Test is an American talent show that aired on ABC from 1948 to 1953. This program holds the distinction as the first regularly broadcast television series by the American Broadcasting Company.

== Format ==
Debuting on April 15, 1948, and hosted first by Bert Lytell and then Neil Hamilton, &quot;Hollywood Screen Test&quot; sought to give exposure to many up-and-coming actors who were looking for their big break. The relatively unknown actors would be picked to guest star on the show, then they would have half-hour scenes of dialogue with established stage and screen actors.

Actors who appeared on &quot;Hollywood Screen Test&quot; included Grace Kelly, Jack Klugman, Pernell Roberts, Jack Lemmon, Michael Strong, Tommy Rettig, Susan Cabot, and Ralph Clanton.

Martha Wayne and Robert Quarry were assistants on the program. Ted Campbell was the announcer. Lester H. Lewis created the program. He and his wife, Juliette Lewis were the producers. Directors were Frederic Carr and Alton Alexander.

In 1951, participants on the program were selected via regional talent searches, such as a June 5, 1951, session in Detroit in which Jessica Landau, a Universal-International representative, chose a winner from 10 contestants. That was one of 11 searches over six weeks in a cooperative effort between Universal and the program.

==Schedule==
This program was the first network series telecast on ABC, which began regular broadcasting in April 1948.

==Reception and lawsuit==
Jack Gould, in a review of the February 2, 1953, episode in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the show as &quot;a program that in its own quiet way often does more real experimentation in drama than many of its more publicized counterparts.&quot; He complimented the presentation of &quot;With Malice Toward None&quot; as &quot;creative TV, with a point of view and imagination and made for an absorbing thirty minutes&quot;.

In January 1949, Screen Test, Incorporated, sued ABC and the show&#x27;s producers for $500,000, charging that their idea had been stolen. The plaintiffs had a &quot;Screen Test&quot; radio program and said that existence of &quot;Hollywood Screen Test&quot; had cost them an opportunity to sell their show. A Supreme Court justice in New York City refused to issue a permanent injunction against &quot;Hollywood Screen Test&quot; when he put the case on the court&#x27;s docket.

==Episodes==
Six episodes are in the collection of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

<doc id="786328" wikidata="Q3413999" url="?curid=786328" title="Queen Anne, Seattle">
<text>Queen Anne is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington. Queen Anne covers an area of , and has a population of about 28,000. It is bordered by Belltown to the south, Lake Union to the east, the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the north and Interbay to the west.

The neighborhood is built on a hill, now named Queen Anne Hill, which became a popular spot for the city&#x27;s early economic and cultural elite to build their mansions. Its name is derived from the Queen Anne architectural style in which many of the early homes were built.

==Geography and history==

===Location and borders===

Queen Anne is bounded on the north by the Fremont Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, beyond which is Fremont; on the west by 15th and Elliott Avenues West, beyond which is Interbay, Magnolia, and Elliott Bay; on the east by Lake Union and Aurora Avenue North, beyond which is Westlake. As a neighborhood toponym, &quot;Queen Anne&quot; may include Lower Queen Anne, also known as &quot;Uptown&quot;, the area at the southern base of the hill, just north and west of Seattle Center. Whether or not Lower Queen Anne is considered a separate neighborhood matters in setting Queen Anne&#x27;s southern boundary, which is either West Mercer Street or Denny Way.

Queen Anne can be reached from Interstate 5 via the Mercer Street Exit (Exit 167). The neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfares are Gilman Drive West, 3rd Avenue West, Queen Anne Avenue North, Boston Street, and a set of streets, collectively known as Queen Anne Boulevard, that loop around the crown of the hill and reflect a comprehensive boulevard design in the style of the Olmsted Brothers architectural firm. The design was never fully executed, but it remains part of the Seattle Parks System.

While Queen Anne stands out in Seattle geography due to its proximity to downtown and three television broadcast towers, the highest point in the city, above sea level, is in West Seattle. Queen Anne slopes are home to seven of the twenty steepest streets in the city and 120 pedestrian staircases.

===Demographics===

Including the sub-neighborhoods of &quot;North Queen Anne&quot;, &quot;West Queen Anne&quot;, &quot;East Queen Anne&quot; and &quot;Lower Queen Anne&quot; (or &quot;Uptown&quot;), Queen Anne has approximately 19,000 households and a total population of about 36,000. Queen Anne is disproportionately populated by unmarried, white, young adults. The population is more racially homogeneous than Seattle as a whole.

===Significant events===
The Vashon Glacier carved Queen Anne Hill&#x27;s topography more than 13,000 years ago, and human habitation in the area began some 3000 years ago. When white settlers arrived in the mid-19th century, the Duwamish tribe maintained a seasonal presence in and around Queen Anne.
White settlement of Queen Anne stemmed from the arrival of the Denny Party at West Seattle″s Alki Point in November 1851. In 1853, David Denny staked a claim to of land the Duwamish called &quot;baba&#x27;kwoh&quot;, prairies, known today as Lower Queen Anne, and bounded by Elliott Bay to the west, Lake Union to the east, Mercer Street to the north, and Denny Way to the south. Denny called the area &quot;Potlach Meadows&quot;. Development of the hill, called at various times North Seattle, Galer Hill, and Eden Hill, was slow. Then an 1875 windstorm flattened thousands of trees on Queen Anne, making the previously dense forest more appealing for settlement. The hill began to be called &quot;Queen Anne&quot; by 1885, after the Queen Anne style houses that dominated the area. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway (1883) and the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (1887), the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, and the opening of three cable car lines to the top of the hill starting in 1890, including the Queen Anne Counterbalance, further encouraged residential and business development.

The 1917 opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and the Fremont and Ballard Bridges over it, made the area more appealing for maritime and timber industries, and connected Queen Anne with communities to the north. On the south side of the hill, the 1927 completion of a Civic Center (with auditorium, ice arena and football field) on David Denny&#x27;s Potlach Meadows land brought residents from all over the city to Queen Anne for concerts and sporting events.

The first television broadcast in the Pacific Northwest originated from the hill in November 1948, when KRSC-TV (now KING-TV) signed-on from its transmitting tower at Third Avenue North and Galer Street. KOMO-TV installed its own tower nearby, on Galer Street and Orange Place North, and began operations from there in December 1953, and KIRO-TV went on the air in February 1958 from a tower adjacent to its original studios on Queen Anne Avenue.

&quot;The 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair was perhaps the most transformational single event in the history of Queen Anne&quot;, according to historians Florence K. Lentz and Mimi Sheridan. Named the Century 21 Exposition, the fair expanded on existing Civic Center infrastructure on the old &quot;baba&#x27;kwoh&quot; swale. After the fair, the grounds became the Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, Experience Music Project, Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame, the north terminal of the Seattle monorail and KeyArena.

The Seattle SuperSonics began playing at the then-Seattle Center Coliseum in 1967. The Seattle Thunderbirds hockey team began play next door at the Mercer Street Arena in 1977. The Seattle Storm basketball team began play at KeyArena in 2000.

As late as 1964, the area had a large enough population of families with children to motivate opening McClure Middle School, but by 1981 a decline in such families led the school system to close Queen Anne High School, North Queen Anne Elementary School, and West Queen Anne Elementary School.

Assistant United States Attorney Thomas C. Wales was shot in his home in the Queen Anne neighborhood on October 11, 2001, dying the next day of his wounds. The murder remains unsolved.

===Landmarks===
Queen Anne is home to 29 official Seattle landmarks, including 12 historic houses. A group of residences on 14th Avenue West, built between 1890 and 1910, include one of the few remaining Queen Anne style houses on the hill. The North Queen Anne Drive Bridge, built in 1936 across Wolf Creek, is a parabolic steel arch bridge, declared a historic landmark for its unique engineering style. One of the oldest wooden-hulled tugboats still afloat, the &quot;Arthur Foss&quot;, is moored near the base of Queen Anne. Queen Anne Boulevard, which circles the crown of the hill, and some of the original retaining walls complete with decorative brickwork, balustrades, and street lights, are also designated landmarks. Although not located at Queen Anne and no longer located west of present-day Seattle Center, the Denny Cabin was built by David Denny in 1889 as a real-estate office and was made from trees cut down on Queen Anne Hill.

===Library===

The Queen Anne branch of the Seattle Public Library is housed in a 1914 building funded by Andrew Carnegie and built in late Tudor Revival architecture style. The structure, renovated in 2007, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been named a landmark by Seattle&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Board.

===Parks and cemeteries===
The Seattle Parks and Recreation department maintains 24 parks on Queen Anne. Kerry Park, located on Highland Drive, covers a mere , but boasts one of the most attractive views of the city, with downtown at the center of focus along with the Space Needle, and on clear days, Mount Rainier in the background. From this point there are also views of Elliott Bay and West Seattle. Kinnear Park, with of woodland and grass, is Queen Anne&#x27;s largest park, offering views of the grain elevator at Pier 86. Rachel&#x27;s Park, formerly Soundview Terrace, is a play area on the west slope of the hill named after Rachel Pearson, a 6-year-old girl who died on Alaska Airlines Flight 261 in 2000. Queen Anne Bowl, adjacent to the 9.2 David Rodgers Park on the north slope of Queen Anne, has a dirt running track and synthetic surface soccer pitch. Bhy Kracke Park in East Queen Anne, features &quot;one of the best views in the city,&quot; a playground, picnic shelter, several small grassy areas, and a paved walking path connecting the different levels of the park.
