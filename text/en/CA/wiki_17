<text>The Catalan phonology (or Valencian phonology) has a certain degree of dialectal variation. Although there are two standard varieties, one based on Central Eastern dialect and another one based on South-Western or Valencian, this article deals with features of all or most dialects, as well as regional pronunciation differences.

Catalan is characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition, and voicing assimilation; a set of 7 to 8 phonemic vowels, vowel assimilations (including vowel harmony), many phonetic diphthongs, and vowel reduction, whose precise details differ between dialects.

== Consonants ==

Phonetic notes:
* , are laminal denti-alveolar , . After , they are laminal alveolar , .
* , are velar but fronted to pre-velar position before front vowels. In some Majorcan dialects, the situation is reversed; the main realization is palatal , , but before liquids and rounded back vowels they are velar , .
* , , are apical front alveolar , , , but the first two are laminal denti-alveolar , before , . In addition, is postalveolar or alveolo-palatal before , , , , velar before , and labiodental before , (), where it merges with . It also merges with (to ) before , .
* , , are apical back alveolar , , , also described as postalveolar.
* , are apical alveolar , . They may be somewhat fronted, so that the stop component is laminal denti-alveolar, while the fricative component is apical post-dental. is rare and may not be phonemic (see below).
* , are laminal &quot;front alveolo-palatal&quot; , .
* There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of , , , and ; while and describe them as &quot;back alveolo-palatal&quot;, implying that the characters would be more accurate, they (and all literature on Catalan) use the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives while using for alveolo-palatal sounds in examples in other languages like Polish or Chinese. Otherwise, sources, like generally describe them as &quot;postalveolar&quot;.

=== Obstruents ===
Obstruents assimilate to the voicing of the following consonant. Voiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing so that (&#x27;cold&#x27;, m. s.) is pronounced with (, , ) while (&#x27;cold&#x27;, f. pl.) is pronounced with (, , ).

Table with minimal pairs:

==== Plosives ====
Voiced plosives (also called stops) become lenited to fricatives or approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: → , → , → .

* Exceptions include after lateral consonants (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;oeil-de-boeuf&#x27;) and after labiodentals (, ), e.g. (E) / (W) (&#x27;really good pen&#x27;).
* In non-betacist dialects (those who do not merge with ), remains unlenited ( (B) / (V) &#x27;oeil-de-boeuf&#x27;).
* In some dialects, e.g. many Valencian accents, initial (that is, in all environments except after a nasal) can be lenited: (&#x27;cat&#x27;).
* In the coda position, these sounds are always realized as stops; except in some Valencian dialects, where they might be lenited.

In Catalan and Balearic (not in Valencian), labial and , and velar stops and may be geminated in intervocalic position before (e.g. &#x27;village, people&#x27;, &#x27;rule&#x27;).

Intervocalic is dropped (particularly in participles) in regular speech in Valencian, with compensatory lengthening of vowel ; e.g. (&#x27;afternoon&#x27;).

In Majorcan varieties, velar stops and become and word-finally and before front vowels, in some of these dialects, this has extended to all environments except before liquids and back vowels; e.g. (&#x27;blood&#x27;).

* The dorso-palatal may occur in complementary distribution with , only in Majorcan varieties that have dorso-palatals rather than the velars found in most dialects: (&#x27;war&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;the war&#x27;).

In the Valencian dialects final voiceless plosives () may be lenited before a vowel: (&#x27;all this&#x27;).

The preposition &quot;amb&quot; (&#x27;with&#x27;) in Central Catalan is usually pronounced , but in careful speech when it is before a vowel sound or an is pronounced .

==== Affricates ====
The phonemic status of affricates is dubious; after other consonants, affricates are in free variation with fricatives, e.g. (E) / (W) (&#x27;hair parting&#x27;) and may be analyzed as either single phonemes or clusters of a stop and a fricative.

* Alveolar affricates, and , occur the least of all affricates.
** only occurs intervocalically: (E) / (W) (&#x27;toxic substances&#x27;).
*** In Valencian, many instances of (especially the -&quot;itzar&quot; suffix) are deaffricated to : (&#x27;to use&#x27;).
** Instances of arise mostly from compounding; the few lexical instances arise from historical compounding. For instance, (E) / (W) (&#x27;maybe&#x27;) comes from (&#x27;may&#x27;) + (&#x27;be&#x27; inf). As such, does not occur word-initially; other than some rare words of foreign origin (e.g. &#x27;tsar&#x27;, &#x27;tsuga&#x27;), but it may occur word-finally and quite often in cases of heteromorphemic (i.e. across a morpheme boundary) plural endings: (&#x27;everybody&#x27;). Several linguists claim is not a phoneme on its own, but a simple combination of and , in the same way that the in English &#x27;cats&#x27; is not phonemic.
* The distribution of alveolo-palatal affricates, and , depends on dialect:
**In most of Valencian and southern Catalonia, most occurrences of correspond to the voiced fricative in Standard Eastern Catalan: (&#x27;ice&#x27;).
** In Standard Eastern Catalan, word-initial is found only in a few words of foreign origin (e.g. &#x27;Czech&#x27;, &#x27;Tchaikovsky&#x27;) while being found freely intervocalically (e.g. &#x27;arrow&#x27;) and word-finally: (E) / (W) (&#x27;office&#x27;).
** Standard Eastern Catalan also only allows in intervocalic position (e.g. &#x27;medic&#x27;). Phonemic analyses show word-final occurrences of (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;skew ray&#x27;), but final devoicing eliminates this from the surface: (&#x27;ray&#x27;).
** In various other dialects (as well as in emphatic speech), including Valencian and its standard variety, occurs word-initially and after another consonant to the exclusion of (although there are exceptions). These instances of word-initial seem to correspond to in other dialects, including the standard (Eastern Catalan) on which the orthography is based: (&#x27;bedbug&#x27;), pronounced in Standard Catalan, is in these varieties (including Standard Valencian).

There is dialectal variation in regards to affricate length, with long affricates occurring in both Eastern and Western dialects such as in Majorca and few areas in Southern Valencia. Also, intervocalic affricates are predominantly long, especially those that are voiced or occurring immediately after a stressed syllable (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;medic&#x27;). In Modern Valencian and have merged into , except in some parts of Southern Valencian. 

In Aragonese Catalan (especially Ribagorçan) and Central Valencian (the so called accent), voiced fricatives and affricates are missing (i.e. has merged with , has merged with , with only voiceless realizations occurring).

==== Fricatives ====
The labiodental fricative () occurs in Balearic, as well as in Alguerese, Standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. Everywhere else (including parts of Valencian, like its central dialect), it has merged with historic so that and occur in complementary distribution.
* In Valencian, is realised as an approximant after continuants: (&#x27;advance&#x27;).
* In Majorcan, and are in complementary distribution, with occurring before vowels (e.g. &#x27;blue&#x27; f. vs. &#x27;blue&#x27; m.).
* In other varieties that have both sounds, they are in contrast before vowels, with neutralization in favor of before consonants.

In Majorcan and Minorcan, undergoes total assimilation to a following consonant (just as stops do): (&#x27;large puff&#x27;).

The dental fricative only appears in Ribagorçan and Lower Aragon, in contrast with . Spanish loanwords with this sound may be replaced by in both Catalan and Valencian.

The velar fricative is found in Spanish interferences, especially in Aragon and Southern Valencia.

The glottal fricative is found in loanwords and interjections, although is usually replaced by in loanwords.

=== Sonorants ===

==== Laterals ====
Laterals assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant (see &quot;Assimilations&quot; below). The lateral may be geminated in careful speech (e.g. &#x27;illusion&#x27;). A geminated may also occur (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;line&#x27;).

* While &quot;dark (velarized) l&quot;, , may be a positional allophone of in most dialects (such as in the syllable coda; e.g. &#x27;ground&#x27;), is dark irrespective of position in Eastern dialects like Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan (e.g. ). For simplicity dark l is not transcribed in this article.
* In Aragonese Catalan (including Ribagorçan), is palatalized to in consonant clusters; e.g. &#x27;it rains&#x27;.
* In Alguerese and Ribagorçan word-final is depalatized to : (&#x27;rooster&#x27;).

==== Nasals ====
Nasals assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant (see &quot;Assimilations&quot; below). In careful speech, and may be geminated (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;unnecessary&#x27;, (E) / (W) &#x27;to store&#x27;). 
* In Alguerese and Ribagorçan word-final is depalatized to : (&#x27;year&#x27;).

==== Rhotics ====
The distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Wheeler analyzes intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme: (E) / (W) &#x27;saw, mountains&#x27; (this is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics).
* Between vowels, the two contrast (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;myrrh&#x27; vs. (E) / (W) &#x27;he or she looks&#x27;), but they are otherwise in complementary distribution. appears in the onset, except in word-initial position ( &#x27;donkey&#x27;), after , , and ( &#x27;lining&#x27;, &#x27;honour&#x27;, &#x27;Israel&#x27;), and in compounds ( &#x27;infrared&#x27;), where is used.
** Majorcan contrasts and in word final position, e.g. (&#x27;I speak&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;he or she dies&#x27;).
** In Majorcan final + can be assimilated to (e.g. &quot;carn&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27;).
* Different dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda, with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects like those of Barcelona or Girona featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears ( (W), (E) &#x27;for&#x27;, but (E) &#x27;for you&#x27;).
* There is free variation in word-initially, after , , and , and in compounds (if is preceded by consonant), wherein is pronounced or , the latter being similar to English &quot;red&quot;: (&#x27;donkey&#x27;).
** In Northern Catalonia and in some accents of Majorcan (e.g. in the town of Sóller), a uvular trill or approximant can be heard instead of the alveolar trill; e.g. (&#x27;to run&#x27;).

== Vowels ==

Phonetic notes:
* The vowel ( in General Catalan) is further back and open than the Castilian counterpart in North-Western and Central Catalan (i.e. it approaches in isolation or in a neutral environment), it is slightly fronted and closed in Valencian and Ribagorçan (), and further fronted and closed () in Majorcan.
** Stressed can be further retracted to in contact with velar consonants (including the velarised ), and fronted to in contact with palatals. This is not transcribed in the article.
*** The palatal pronunciation of may merge with by some speakers.
* The central vowel in stressed position is found in Majorcan and part of Minorcan, in the Balearic Islands.
** The realization of the reduced vowel varies from mid to near-open , with the latter variant being the most usual in the Barcelona metropolitan area, where the distinction between and is less pronounced than in other varieties that maintain the distinction.
* The open-mid and are lower in Majorcan, Minorcan and Valencian.
** is slightly more open and centralised before liquids and in monosyllabics.
** is most often a back vowel. In some dialects (like Majorcan and Southern Valencian) can be unrounded.
* and can be realised as mid vowels in some cases. This occurs more often with .
** In Northern Catalan, Modern Alguerese and some places bordering the Spanish-speaking areas, open-mid and close-mid vowels may merge into mid vowels; and .
* The close vowels are more open than in Castilian. Unstressed are centralized.
** In Valencian and most Balearic dialects are further open and centralized, especially in unstressed position .
* Northern Catalan sometimes adds two loan rounded vowels, and , from French and Occitan (e.g. &#x27;aim&#x27;, &#x27;leaves&#x27;).
** Similarly French and (and ) are mostly adapted with (e.g. ) and (), respectively .
* Phonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal; e.g. (E) / (W) (&#x27;Sunday&#x27;).
* Vowels can be lengthened in some contexts.

=== Stressed vowels ===

Most varieties of Catalan contrast seven stressed vowel phonemes. However, some Balearic dialects have an additional stressed vowel phoneme (); e.g. (&#x27;dry, I sit&#x27;). The stressed schwa of these dialects corresponds to in Central Catalan and in Western Catalan varieties (that is, Central and Western Catalan dialects differ in their incidence of and , with appearing more frequently in Western Catalan; e.g. Central Catalan vs. Western Catalan (&#x27;dry, I sit&#x27;).

Contrasting series of the main Catalan dialects:





=== Reduced vowels ===
In Eastern Catalan, vowels in unstressed position reduce to three : , , (phonetically in Barcelona); , , ; remains unchanged. However there are some dialectal differences: Alguerese merges , and with ; and in most areas of Majorca, can appear in unstressed position (that is, and are usually reduced to ).

In Western Catalan (which includes Valencian and North-Western Catalan), vowels in unstressed position reduce to five: , ; , ; remain unchanged. However, in some Western dialects reduced vowels tend to merge into different realizations in some cases:

* Unstressed may merge with before a nasal or sibilant consonant (e.g. &#x27;anvil&#x27;, &#x27;swarm&#x27;), in some environments before any consonant (e.g. &#x27;earthy&#x27;), and in monosyllabic clitics. This sounds almost the same as the Barcelonian open schwa . Likewise, unstressed may merge into when in contact with palatal consonants (e.g. &#x27;lord&#x27;).
* Unstressed may merge with before a bilabial consonant (e.g. &#x27;covered&#x27;), before a stressed syllable with a high vowel (e.g. &#x27;rabbit&#x27;), in contact with palatal consonants (e.g. &#x27;Joseph&#x27;), and in monosyllabic clitics.
* Besides vowel harmony or vowel assimilation (see below), unstressed and may be found sporadically in compounds like (&#x27;seventeen&#x27;) and (or ) (&#x27;nineteen&#x27;).

==== Vowel harmony ====
The harmony of Valencian is a clear example of harmony conditioned by a strong element: in some Valencian dialects, word-final post-tonic becomes and when the preceding syllable contains tonic open-mid (or near-open) vowels and ; that is, and propagate the palatal and labial features, respectively, to the final vowel , as the examples. The articulatory features extend from a phonologically privileged position—the stressed syllable—to a weak position—an unstressed syllable—a perceptual asymmetry emphasized by the fact that the harmony trigger belongs to the radical while the assimilated segment is normally an inflectional affix.
:
:
In the most widespread system of harmony, both open-mid vowels cause assimilation; in other systems, distributed over the harmonic territory quite randomly, only one of the vowels triggers the change. For example, in Cullera only the front vowel causes assimilation, while in Borriana the labial vowel is the only one that allows harmony. However, in both the broadest and the narrowest versions, and even in the sporadic cases of two-way harmony that are presented here, the pattern of strong → weak extension remains constant.

In the harmonic phenomenon just described, articulatory features spread from left to right. However, there is no shortage of assimilations in which the features spread to the left of the prominent position. This occurs in Majorcan when pretonic is closed to in words that contain a close tonic vowel, e.g. &quot;c&#x27;nill&quot;, &quot;c&#x27;sí&quot;, &quot;c&quot;&quot;mú&quot; (cf. ). The change involves the extension of the height feature again in the direction dictated by the strong → weak saliency relationship. Similar closures are documented in various Western languages; among these, Tortosan stands out, where the phenomenon, quite variable and often limited to the elderly, presents the peculiarity that height does not only propagate from tonic vowels, but can also do so from unstressed ones (cfr. ). In general terms, and in accordance with the data collected by (in prep.), a pretonic mid vowel may become close under the influence of a close vowel with the same point of articulation—palatal or labial—in a following syllable; in this way, vowel sequences of the type &quot;e...i&quot; and &quot;o...u&quot; become &quot;i...i&quot; a) and u...u b), respectively. The assimilation of mid vowels to a high vowel of a different point of articulation is possible, but in the sequence &quot;e...u&quot; it is reduced to some words c), and in the sequence &quot;o...i&quot; it is usually limited to fossilized cases, so that the disharmonious alternatives in d) reflect only copied pronunciations of the orthography.
:
:
:
:
Of the phenomena presented above, the most common and systematic is the change &quot;e...i&quot; → &quot;i...i&quot;. As in the examples, becomes when it precedes a stressed or unstressed . Closure can even affect a series of two pretonic vowels. Assimilation never affects stressed vowels and there is also no harmony when and do not occupy adjacent syllables.

With certain restrictions, the phenomenon can modify the final vowel of the first element of a compound and proclitic elements such as numerals or unstressed pronouns. In the last case, when the vowel of the pronoun is not strictly adjacent to the syllable that triggers the harmony, there is no assimilation; according to (in prep.), the lack of spread is related to the fact that groups of pronouns generate a secondary accent, which would protect the original quality of the vowel.

 also reports some examples of rightward (regressive) assimilation between weak elements; that is, cases where an unstressed sequence &quot;i...e&quot; becomes &quot;i...i&quot;. Harmony to the right is documented only between vowels that are in pretonic position; therefore, the inflectional elements and the post-tonic vowels belonging to the radical are excluded from the change.

General Valencian is another variety in which the extension of features is limited to the main metric foot: in plain words, the final post-tonic, which is part of the main foot, is affected by harmony a); on the other hand, in proparoxytone words (&quot;esdrúixoles&quot;) the final does not belong to the main foot and is, therefore, beyond the scope of assimilation b). In Valencian from the south of Alicante, the harmony affects an intermediate layer between the main metrical foot and the clitic group: the prosodic word (PPr) (cfr. , , ).

Harmony in General Valencian:



Harmony from Southern Valencian (Alicante):

In the harmony of Valencian, Majorcan and, mostly, Tortosan, the features extend from a strong element to a weak element. In the other possible model, on the other hand, the features are spread in the reverse direction, that is, from positions that are not prominent to positions that are stronger from the perceptual point of view. The trigger for change is in this case a weak element (cf. ). Central Catalan provides an example of harmony—with considerable geographical and idiolectal variation—conditioned by segments located in weak positions. In this dialect, stressed mid vowels in words from other languages tend to be adapted as open mids, as in the paroxytones in example a), with regular reduction in the unstressed syllable, that is, with the vowels , and in this position. Borrowings also have the peculiarity that they tend to block the neutralization of the unstressed middle vowels e and o, which are realized as and , respectively. In principle, these two trends should not be mutually exclusive; however, if the post-tonic sound is close-mid, the tonic mids are usually also realized as close, as shown by the plain words in example b), in which the levelling between the two vowels is almost universal. Therefore, the quality of the most prominent vowel is determined by the features of the following vowel, since the appearance of close-mid vowels in tonic position depends on the presence of vowels of the same pitch in the post-tonic syllable.
:
:
In proparoxytones there is greater variability. In the variety analyzed by &quot;esdrúixol&quot; words (i.e. words with stressed on the antepenultimate syllable) are generally subject to the same restrictions and the presence of a close mid in post-tonic position implies the presence of close mids in tonic position a); the syllabic adjacency between the two vowels is key to harmony, since words like &quot;Sòcrates&quot; or &quot;Hèrcules&quot; are usually presented without assimilation despite the presence of an unreduced post-tonic e. In the variety described by , on the other hand, post-tonic vowels do not condition the realization of the tonic vowel in &quot;esdrúixols&quot; b). On the other hand, and in accordance with the interpretation of the aforementioned authors, the adaptation of tonic vowels as open mids is compatible in all varieties with the appearance of unreduced mid vowels in pre-tonic syllables.

==== Vowels in contact ====
One of the most unique features of Catalan and Valencian is the treatment of vowels that come into contact within the speech chain. When a word-final vowel meets an initial vowel there are two possible reactions: lengthening (if both vowels are the same) or weakening/elision of one of the vowels (if they are different). In general terms, two consecutive vowels diphthongize more frequently in Valencian, North Western Catalan and Alguerese. Some examples (in Valencian):

;Lengthening
* Unstressed followed by , e.g. &quot;platges i illots&quot; (&#x27;beaches and islets&#x27;).
* Unstressed followed by , e.g. &quot;escrit o oral?&quot; (&#x27;written or oral?&#x27;).

;Elision
* Unstressed followed by stressed → , e.g. &quot;quina hora és?&quot; or (&#x27;what time is it?&#x27;).
* Stressed followed by unstressed → , e.g. &quot;mà esquerra&quot; or (&#x27;left hand&#x27;).
* Unstressed followed by unstressed → , e.g. &quot;agarra el gos&quot; (&#x27;take the dog&#x27;).
* Stressed followed by stressed → , e.g. &quot;què has fet?&quot; (&#x27;what have you done?&#x27;).
* Unstressed followed by → , e.g. &quot;este home&quot; (&#x27;this man&#x27;).
* Stressed followed by unstressed → , e.g. &quot;no els volen&quot; (&#x27;they don&#x27;t want them&#x27;).

=== Diphthongs and triphthongs ===
There are also a number of phonetic diphthongs and triphthongs, all of which begin and/or end in or .

In Standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with or ) are only possible in the following contexts:
* in word-initial position, e.g. (&#x27;yoghurt&#x27;).
* The semivowel ( or ) occurs between vowels as in (&#x27;he or she was doing&#x27;) or (&#x27;they say&#x27;).
* In the sequences or plus vowel, e.g. (&#x27;glove&#x27;), (&#x27;quota&#x27;), (&#x27;question&#x27;), (&#x27;penguin&#x27;); these exceptional cases even lead some scholars to hypothesize the existence of rare labiovelar phonemes and .

== Processes ==
There are certain instances of &quot;compensatory diphthongization&quot; in Majorcan so that (&#x27;logs&#x27;) (in addition to deleting the palatal stop) develops a compensating palatal glide and surfaces as (and contrasts with the unpluralized ). Diphthongization compensates for the loss of the palatal stop (segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization compensates for the loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in (&#x27;year&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;years&#x27;).

The dialectal distribution of compensatory diphthongization is almost entirely dependent on the dorsal stop () and the extent of consonant assimilation (whether or not it is extended to palatals).

Voiced affricates are devoiced after stressed vowels in dialects like Eastern Catalan where there may be a correlation between devoicing and lengthening (gemination) of voiced affricates: → (&#x27;medic&#x27;). In Barcelona, voiced stops may be fortified (geminated and devoiced); e.g. &#x27;village, people&#x27;).
In (Majorcan) Catalan is known the historical process of erasing the vowel (the nucleus) of unstressed final syllables. (cited by ) and , have proposed similar theories, in that one or more &#x27;extrasyllabic&#x27; final consonants represent the opening of a syllable with null vowel (Burzio) or empty nucleus (Kaye). However, in the case of Catalan, such a structure is fundamentally the one that has been proposed (e.g. in ) to trigger vowel epenthesis in cases such as the followings:

* → (&#x27;I wide&#x27;)
* → (&#x27;I ?&#x27;)
* → (&#x27;I stake&#x27;, )
* → (&#x27;I run&#x27;)

=== Assimilations ===

Catalan denti-alveolar stops can fully assimilate to the following consonant, producing gemination; this is particularly evident before nasal and lateral consonants: e.g. (&#x27;week&#x27;), (&#x27;rind&#x27;), , (&#x27;roll&#x27;). Learned words can alternate between featuring and not featuring such assimilation (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;atlas&#x27;, (E) / (W) &#x27;to submit&#x27;, ~ &#x27;ethnic&#x27;).

There is dialectal variation regarding words with . While Central and North-Western Catalan tend to innovate with a palatalised pronunciation , Valencian and Balearic maintain the traditional pronunciation without palatalisation , i.e. , in most cases (e.g. vs &#x27;almond&#x27;).

Valencian dialects (especially Central Valencian) features simple elision in many of these cases (e.g &#x27;week&#x27;, &#x27;roll&#x27;) and learned words might not exhibit either assimilation or elision: and .

== Prosody ==

=== Stress ===
Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word (e.g. (E) / (W) &#x27;compass&#x27;, &#x27;punishment&#x27;, (E) / (W) &#x27;fool&#x27;).

Compound words and adverbs formed with may have a syllable with secondary stress (e.g. (E) (W) &#x27;willingly&#x27;; (E) (W) &#x27;lightning conductor&#x27;) but every lexical word has just one syllable with main stress.

=== Phonotactics ===
The structure of the syllable shows a mandatory nucleus, and the optional presence of a margin before and/or behind the nucleus. Core and margin contrast articulatory due to the fact that the core is emitted with a higher degree of oral opening than the margin. In Catalan and Valencian, the core position is occupied by a vowel and the margin position by one or more consonants. Depending on the number of consonants that make up the margin and the location of the margin in relation to the core, syllabic structures of the type V, CV, VC, CVC, CCV, CCVC, CCVCC, VCC, VCCC, CVCC, CVCCC, etc. are possible. The margin that precedes the nucleus is called &quot;explosive&quot;, and the one that follows it, &quot;implosive&quot;, syllables can be classified as &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; by virtue of the absence or presence of a margin postnuclear, respectively.

Any consonant, as well as and may be an onset. Clusters may consist of a consonant plus a semivowel (C, C) or an obstruent plus a liquid. Some speakers may have one of these obstruent-plus-liquid clusters preceding a semivowel, e.g. (&#x27;watermelon&#x27;); for other speakers, this is pronounced (i.e. the semivowel must be syllabic in this context).

Word-medial codas are restricted to one consonant + ( (E) / (W)). In the coda position, voice contrasts among obstruents are neutralized. Although there are exceptions (such as &#x27;future&#x27;), syllable-final rhotics are often lost before a word boundary or before the plural morpheme of most words: (E) / (W) (&#x27;color&#x27;) vs. (E) / (W) (&#x27;bright color&#x27;).

In Central Eastern (and North-Western Catalan), obstruents fail to surface word-finally when preceded by a homorganic consonant (e.g. ). Complex codas simplify only if the loss of the segment doesn&#x27;t result in the loss of place specification.

When the suffix is added to it makes , indicating that the underlying representation is (with subsequent cluster simplification), however when the copula is added it makes . The resulting generalization is that this underlying will only surface in a morphologically complex word. Despite this, word-final codas are not usually simplified in most of Balearic and Valencian (e.g. ).

Word-initial clusters from Graeco-Latin learned words tend to drop the first phoneme: (&#x27;gnome&#x27;), (E) / (W) (&#x27;mnemotechnical&#x27;), (E) / (W) (&#x27;pneumatic&#x27;), (E) / (W) (&#x27;pseudonym&#x27;), (E) / (W) (&#x27;pterodactylus&#x27;).

Word-final obstruents are devoiced; however, they assimilate voicing of the following consonant, e.g. (E) / (W) (&#x27;silkworm&#x27;). In regular and fast speech, stops often assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant producing phonetic gemination: (&#x27;all good&#x27;).

Word-final fricatives (except ) are voiced before a following vowel; e.g. (E) / (W) (&#x27;huge bus&#x27;).

== Dialectal variation ==

The differences in the vocalic systems outlined above are the main criteria used to differentiate between the major dialects:
Wheeler distinguishes two major dialect groups, western and eastern dialects; the latter of which only allow , , and to appear in unstressed syllables and include Northern Catalan, Central Catalan, Balearic, and Alguerese. Western dialects, which allow any vowel in unstressed syllables, include Valencian and North-Western Catalan.

Regarding consonants, betacism and fricative–affricate alternations are the most prominent differences between dialects.

Other dialectal features are:

;Vowels
* In a number of dialects unstressed can merge with (Eastern dialects) or (Western dialects) according to the previous or following vowel (i.e. through assimilation when these vowels are high or dissimilation when they are mid or low). This merger is especially common in words with the prefix or .
* In Southern Valencian subvarieties, especially in Alicante Valencian, the diphthong (phonetically in Valencian) has become : (&#x27;bulls&#x27;).
* In regular speech in both Eastern and Western Catalan dialects, word-initial unstressed — or —may be diphthongized to (Eastern Catalan) or (Western Catalan): (E) (W) &#x27;to drown, suffocate&#x27;.

;Consonants
* Varying degrees of &quot;L-velarization&quot; among dialects: is dark irrespective of position in Balearic and Central Catalan and might tend to vocalization in some cases. In Western varieties like Valencian, this dark l contrasts with a clear l in intervocalic and word-initial position; while in other dialects, like Alguerese or Northern Catalan, is never velarized in any instance.
* (also known as &quot;historic &quot;) in regular speech in most of Majorcan, Northern Catalan and in the historic comarca of Vallès (Barcelona), Latin-derived words that had intervocalic + yod (--, --) or velar + (--, --) developed (e.g. &#x27;straw&#x27;) from Latin ), rather than as in the majority of other regions. Accents with traditional &quot;ieisme&quot; use only in words where this sound developed from Latin initial - (as in &#x27;moon&#x27;) or intervocalic -- (as in &#x27;she&#x27;).
* In northern and transitional Valencian, word-initial and postconsonantal (Eastern Catalan and ) alternates with intervocalically; e.g. &#x27;game&#x27;, but &#x27;worse&#x27;, &#x27;crazy&#x27; (Standard Valencian , ; ; Standard Catalan , and ).
* In northern Valencia and southern Catalonia has merged with realizations of after a high front vocoid; e.g. (&#x27;pottery&#x27;), (&#x27;I insist&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;to pee&#x27;), (&#x27;to leave&#x27;). In these varieties is not found after other voiced consonants, and merges with after consonants; e.g. (&#x27;thorn&#x27;).
* In some Valencian dialects (e.g. Northern Valencian), and are auditorily similar such that neutralization may occur in the future. That is the case of Northern Valencian where is depalatalized to as in (&#x27;box&#x27;). Central Valencian words like (&#x27;half&#x27;) and (&#x27;ugly&#x27;) have been transcribed with rather than the expected , and Southern Valencian &quot;has been reported to undergo depalatalization without merging with &quot;, as in (&#x27;small steps&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;stroll, avenue&#x27;)

== Historical development ==
Catalan shares features with neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, Italian, Sardinian, French, Spanish).

* Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.
* Lenition of voiced stops as in Galician and Spanish.
* Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.
* Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.
* Abundance of and occurring at the end of words, as for instance (&quot;wet&quot;) and (&quot;year&quot;), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.

In contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like (&#x27;male friend&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;female friend&#x27;).

<text>J. Craig Wright (June 21, 1929 – February 3, 2010) was a former Republican justice of the Ohio Supreme Court who served in that office from 1985 to 1996.

Wright was born June 21, 1929, in Chillicothe, Ohio to Harry Jr. and Marjorie Riddle Wright and grew up in Lima, Ohio. He graduated from Woodberry Forest School in 1947, received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Kentucky in 1951 and graduated from Yale Law School in 1954. From 1955 through 1956, he served as a special agent in the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps. Upon completion of his military service, he entered private practice with the law firm of Wright, Gilbert and Jones in Columbus, Ohio.

His judicial career began with his election to the Franklin County Common Pleas Court in 1970, where he served as a judge in the general division for 14 years.

He defeated incumbent Justice James P. Celebrezze in November 1984 to win election to his first term on the Ohio State Supreme Court and was re-elected in 1990. He was replaced by Evelyn Lundberg Stratton after retiring from the Supreme Court in 1996.

Following his retirement, Wright entered private practice in Columbus, Ohio. He retired from private practice in 2003 and served by assignment of the Chief Justice on the Ohio Court of Claims through 2009.

In addition to his judicial and legal activities, Wright was appointed by Governor Bob Taft to serve on the Ohio Chemical Dependency Professionals Board from 2003 to 2006 and, at the time of his death, he was serving on the Ohio Public Defender Commission pursuant to an appointment from the Supreme Court.

Wright&#x27;s legacy includes participation with other lawyers and judges in establishing one of the first efforts in the nation to address substance abuse in the legal profession. This effort was a precursor to the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program that has provided drug and alcohol dependency and mental illness treatment services to thousands of Ohio judges, lawyers, and law students since 1991.

&quot;Craig Wright was an extraordinary jurist,&quot; said Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer. &quot;His intellect and his years of experience in the law served him well as a trial judge and justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Craig&#x27;s work in the field of alcohol and chemical addiction extended and improved the lives of hundreds of people. I have lost a good friend.&quot;

Wright is survived by two daughters, Marjorie Jane and Alice Ann, three grandchildren, a sister, Patricia Wright Klitgaard and a brother, Michael Wright. He was preceded in death by his wife, the former Jane LaFollette and his two brothers: Thornton and Harry Wright III.

<text>Norman Rufus Colin Cohn FBA (12 January 1915 – 31 July 2007) was a British academic, historian and writer who spent 14 years as a professorial fellow and as Astor-Wolfson Professor at the University of Sussex.

==Life==
Cohn was born in London, to a German Jewish father and a Catholic mother. He was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School and Christ Church, Oxford. According to the Italian scholar Lorenzo Ferrari, &quot;Cohn grew up feeling &#x27;a man between all worlds&#x27; with his German-Jewish surname, his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith (although she never had him baptised), and his numerous German relatives&quot;. He was a scholar and research student at Christ Church between 1933 and 1939, taking a first-class degree in Modern Languages in 1936 (French) and in 1939 (German). He served for six years in the British Army, being commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment in 1939 and transferring to the Intelligence Corps in 1944, where his knowledge of modern languages found employment.

In 1941, he married Vera Broido, with whom he had a son, the writer Nik Cohn. In the immediate post-war period, he was stationed in Vienna, ostensibly to interrogate Nazis, but he encountered many refugees from Stalinism, and the similarities in persecutorial obsessions evinced both by Nazism and Stalinism fueled his interest in the historical background for these ideologically opposed, yet functionally similar movements. After his discharge, he taught successively in universities in Scotland, Ireland, England, the United States and Canada.

In 1962, Cohn was approached by &quot;Observer&quot; editor David Astor after Astor gave a speech on the psychopathological roots of extremism. Cohn became the head of the Centre for Research in Collective Psychopathology (later, Columbus Centre), which was set up and initially financed by Astor to look into the causes of extremism and persecution. In 1966, the Centre was formally set up as a research project at the University of Sussex. From 1973 to 1980, Cohn was Astor-Wolfson Professor of History at Sussex.

Following the death of his wife Vera, in December 2004 he married Marina Voikhanskaya, a psychiatrist of Russian origin who had protested in the 1970s against the forcible detainment of political dissidents in the Soviet Union. Norman Cohn died on 31 July 2007, in Cambridge, England, at the age of 92, from a degenerative heart condition.

==Career==
Cohn&#x27;s work as a historian focused on the problem of the roots of that persecutorial fanaticism which became resurgent in modern Europe at a time when industrial progress and the spread of democracy had convinced many that modern civilisation had stepped out forever from the savageries of earlier historical societies. In his &quot;The Pursuit of the Millennium&quot;, an influential work translated into more than eleven languages, he traced back to the distant past the pattern of chiliastic upheaval that marred the revolutionary movements of the 20th century. Likewise, in &quot;Europe&#x27;s Inner Demons&quot; he tracked the historical sources of the mania for scapegoating minorities which, within Christendom, culminated in the Great European witchhunt.

His book &quot;Warrant for Genocide&quot; criticizes the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, an antisemitic forgery purporting to describe a Jewish conspiracy for world domination. He argued that this conspiracy theory motivated its supporters to seek the of the Jewish people and became a major psychological factor in the Nazi Holocaust.

In &quot;Cosmos, Chaos and the World to Come&quot; (1993), he sought to trace the source of millennial religious themes in ancient civilizations. Cohn, with his background in dealing with totalitarian regimes and the sufferings of his relatives during the Holocaust, described all his work as studies on the phenomena that sought &quot;to purify the world through the annihilation of some category of human beings imagined as agents of corruption and incarnations of evil&quot;.

His work was honoured by his election as a Fellow of the British Academy, for which he was nominated by Isaiah Berlin. His &quot;The Pursuit of the Millennium&quot; was ranked as one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century in a survey conducted by &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

As Ferrari pointed out, &quot;the writings of Norman Cohn have gone on to influence entire generations of readers and scholars, from all sorts of backgrounds and vocations. Through their works, historians Stuart Clark (&quot;Thinking with Demons&quot;, 1997), Michael Burleigh (&quot;The Third Reich&quot;, 2000; &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;, 2005; &quot;Sacred Causes&quot;, 2006), Daniel Pick (&quot;The Pursuit of the Nazi Mind&quot;, 2012), philosophers Pierre-André Taguieff (&quot;L’imaginaire du complot mondial&quot;, 2006), John Nicholas Gray (&quot;Black Mass&quot;, 2007) and novelists William Gibson and Ian McEwan have evidenced their intellectual debt to Cohn, who—in the words of psychiatrist Anthony Storr—dedicated his entire life to ‘the important parts of history other historians do not reach: the collective myths that underpin the assumptions, prejudices and beliefs which shake and shape human societies’&quot;.

<text>Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866 – June 3, 1936) was an American chemist, inventor and educator, born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, son of Amos and Anna Page Noyes, née Andrews. He received a PhD in 1890 from Leipzig University under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald.

He served as the acting president of MIT between 1907 and 1909 and as professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology from 1919 to 1936. &quot;Although [the Noyes] laboratory at MIT was like an institute in its intramural funding (from Carnegie Institute of Washington and Noyes&#x27;s patent royalties), Noyes recruited many of his disciples as undergraduates and took a deep interest in undergraduate engineering education, both at MIT and later at Caltech. Roscoe Gilkey Dickinson was one of his famous students.

Noyes was a major influence both on the educational philosophy of the core curriculum of Caltech as well as in the negotiations leading to the creation of the National Research Council along with George Ellery Hale and Robert Millikan. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, between 1921 and 1927.

Noyes was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Noyes–Whitney equation==

Along with Willis Rodney Whitney, he formulated the Noyes–Whitney equation in 1897, which relates the rate of dissolution of solids to the properties of the solid and the dissolution medium. It is an important equation in pharmaceutical science. The relation is given by:

:formula_1

Where:
*formula_2 is the rate of dissolution.
*A is the surface area of the solid.
*C is the concentration of the solid in the bulk dissolution medium.
*formula_3 is the concentration of the solid in the diffusion layer surrounding the solid.
*D is the diffusion coefficient.
*L is the diffusion layer thickness.

He studied at Uppsala University and joined the Swedish Army during the Nine Years&#x27; War, participating in the Battle of Fleurus in 1690. After the battle, he was appointed lieutenant colonel, entered Holy Roman service as Adjutant General, and married Eva Magdalena Oxenstierna, daughter of statesman Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna. Returning to Swedish service he received colonelcy of a regiment in Wismar, and later became colonel of the Kalmar and then Dalarna regiments.

During the Great Northern War, Stenbock served under King Charles XII in his military campaigns in the Baltic and Polish fronts. As director of the General War Commissariat, Stenbock collected substantial funds and supplies for the maintenance of the Swedish army, earning the admiration of Charles XII. In 1705, he was appointed general of the infantry and Governor General of Scania. As acting governor, Stenbock displayed his administrative skills and organized Scania&#x27;s defense against an invading Danish army, which he defeated at the Battle of Helsingborg in 1710. In 1712, he conducted a campaign in northern Germany and defeated a Saxon-Danish army at the Battle of Gadebusch, which earned him his field marshal&#x27;s baton. His career plummeted after his merciless destruction of the city of Altona in 1713. Surrounded by overwhelming allied troops, Stenbock was forced to surrender to King Frederick IV of Denmark during the siege of Tönning. During his captivity in Copenhagen, the Danes revealed Stenbock&#x27;s escape attempt and imprisoned him in Kastellet. There he was the subject to a defamation campaign conducted by Frederick IV and died in 1717 after years of harsh treatment.

Besides his military and administrative professions, Stenbock was regarded as a skilled speaker, painter and craftsman. His military successes contributed to the creation of a heroic cult in Sweden. During the age of romantic nationalism he was consistently praised by Swedish historians and cultural personalities, such as Carl Snoilsky in his poem &quot;Stenbock&#x27;s courier&quot;. His name has inspired streets in several Swedish cities and in 1901 an equestrian statue of Stenbock was unveiled outside Helsingborg city hall.

==Early life==


Magnus Stenbock was born on 22 May 1665 in the parish of Jakob, Stockholm. He was the sixth child of Gustaf Otto Stenbock, member of the Privy Council and Field Marshal, and Christina Catharina De la Gardie, daughter of the Lord High Constable Jacob De la Gardie and sister of the Lord High Chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. Magnus Stenbock was born a count, since Gustaf Otto Stenbock and his brothers Fredrik and Erik were made counts by Queen Christina in 1651. The Stenbock family originates from the Middle Ages. De la Gardie descended from the French-born General Pontus De la Gardie, who became a Swedish nobleman and Baron during the 1570s.

Magnus Stenbock spent much of his childhood with his siblings in the pleasure palace Runsa in Uppland; in the winters they moved to Bååtska Palace on Blasieholmen in Stockholm. When he was 10 years old, his father Gustaf Otto was deposed as Lord High Admiral after being considered to have failed in his mission and was forced to pay the extended fleet reparation of up to 200,000 daler. Gustaf Otto appeased King Charles XI, who decided to halve his fine and appointed him Admiral and commander of Western Sweden during the Scanian War. After the war, Gustaf Otto faced additional financial bills as a result of Charles XI&#x27;s reductions and his breakdown of the old authority of the Privy Council. Gustaf Otto and Christina Catharina solved their financial hardships, but were forced to pay huge sums of money to the crown. They sold large parts of the family&#x27;s properties and estates, retaining only Runsa, Torpa stenhus in Västergötland and Vapnö Castle in Halland. Gustaf Otto had disgraced the Stenbock name and injured the King&#x27;s confidence towards the family. His family&#x27;s disgrace impacted Magnus Stenbock on a personal level and motivated him to try to restore the Stenbock name.

==Education and military service==
Magnus Stenbock was tutored at home from 1671. Haquin Spegel taught him Christianity, and reading and writing in both Swedish and Latin. After Spegel, Stenbock was lectured by theology expert Erik Frykman. Frykman was succeeded by Uppsala student Olof Hermelin, who taught Stenbock between 1680 and 1684, and had a great influence on his linguistic and intellectual development. From Hermelin, Stenbock received practical oratory exercises and was lectured on leading cultural languages such as German and French, ancient history, geography, political science, law, and physical exercises such as fencing, dancing and equitation. Stenbock developed a strong interest in geometry, especially in the field of fortification, and according to Hermelin, displayed great rhetorical and linguistic talent at an early stage.

In the autumn of 1682 Stenbock entered Uppsala University, where he and Olof Hermelin attended lectures with Olof Gardman, professor of Roman law, and Olof Rudbeck, professor of medicine. To complete his master&#x27;s degree, Stenbock conducted an extensive educational voyage in Western Europe. Stenbock traveled in the spring of 1684 with a small company, partly financed by Queen Ulrika Eleonora, with Hermelin serving as host. The first destination was Amsterdam, where Stenbock practiced his language skills and took classes in turning. Inspired by the Dutch painters, Stenbock used his spare time to learn how to paint realistic birds. The next destination was Paris, where Stenbock took private lectures in mathematics from Jacques Ozanam. In 1685 Hermelin left Stenbock after Christina Catharina De la Gardie withdrew her financial support.

In the spring of 1685, Stenbock returned to the Netherlands. With the help of his cousin, Countess Maria Aurora von Königsmarck, he attained an audience with Count Gustaf Carlsson, who was commander of a Dutch regiment, and applied for a commission as ensign in his regiment. The following year Stenbock obtained a Dutch commission from William of Orange, which marked the start of his military career and the end of his travels. In 1687 Stenbock served in Stade, in the Swedish province of Bremen-Verden, as captain of an enlisted German regiment under the command of Stade&#x27;s commandant, Colonel Mauritz Vellingk.

==Nine Years&#x27; War (1689–1695)==

In September 1688 Stenbock was appointed major in the Swedish auxiliary corps led by General Nils Bielke in the Nine Years&#x27; War against France. At that time Sweden was in an alliance with the Netherlands. In January 1689 Stenbock and the Swedish auxiliary corps, under the command of lieutenant colonel Johan Gabriel Banér, were sent to the garrison of Nijmegen. Stenbock stayed in Nijmegen while large parts of the Swedish troops were sent back to the Swedish provinces in Germany, due to tensions between Denmark and the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. The duchy lay south of Denmark, and was allied with Sweden. In early June Stenbock and his regiment were sent to the garrison of Maastricht. In September he was granted permission by Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck to volunteer in the allied army. He experienced no battles, and when the army established winter quarters Stenbock traveled home to Stockholm.

Stenbock returned to Maastricht in April 1690, and was immediately commissioned to the front lines in Wallonia in the Spanish Netherlands, where the Swedish auxiliary corps united with the 30,000-strong allied army of Prince Waldeck. On 29 June of the same year Waldeck was briefed that a French army of 40,000 men under the Duke of Luxembourg was positioned at the town of Fleurus, which came as a huge surprise in the allied field camp. The next day Waldeck&#x27;s army marched towards the Sambre river, and on 1 July the bloody battle of Fleurus took place. Stenbock stood with the Swedish auxiliary corps on the right wing of the allied army, and witnessed the defeat of Waldeck&#x27;s army at the hands of Luxembourg. During the retreat Stenbock took over the command of a Swedish battalion, which he brought to safety from the battlefield, taking some French prisoners and a French standard. Waldeck suffered heavy losses, with the Swedish relief corps effectively destroyed.

After the battle, King Charles XI appointed Stenbock lieutenant colonel in Mauritz Vellingk&#x27;s regiment in Stade. There he worked on administrative and disciplinary tasks for the regiment. In the spring of 1692, a new Swedish auxiliary corps was sent to Heidelberg to support the German troops at the Rhine. Hundreds of men from Vellingk&#x27;s regiment were assigned to the corps, including Stenbock. Stenbock was commissioned to apply for a transit permit from the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Charles I. At the beginning of July 1692 the commander of the allied troops at the Rhine, Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, decided to cross the river to face Field Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges in open battle. The Margrave commissioned Stenbock to take command of a battalion of 300 men and two cannon, and bring a transport fleet via the river route from the town of Gersheim, south of Mainz, to the allied headquarters at Ladenburg near the Neckar&#x27;s inflow into the Rhine. The journey to Gersheim was carried out without hindrance, however, halfway on the way back Stenbock was bombarded by French artillery batteries positioned at Westhofen, Mannheim and Worms. With minor casualties and several damaged ships, Stenbock was able to return to the allied camp and his operation was hailed as a success.

At the end of August the allied army crossed the Rhine to face the French troops at the fortified town of Speyer. After two days of heavy bombardment from French cannons, the allied troops were forced to retreat, and Stenbock ended up among the troops securing the retreat. In June 1693, Stenbock returned to Heidelberg and enlisted with Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, with whom he participated in the relief of Heilbronn. Stenbock searched for commissions in Celle, Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, and was encouraged by Louis William to court Emperor Leopold I in Vienna, to obtain imperial employment. In September Stenbock was appointed colonel of the imperial army, but without a regiment, and was forced to recruit by himself. On the other hand, Stenbock was also promised a position as adjutant general in Louis William&#x27;s army, which was participating in numerous operations around the Electoral Palatinate. In the spring of 1695, Stenbock was sent by the Emperor to Stockholm to present the Emperor&#x27;s demand for Swedish auxiliary troops to King Charles XI, but, due to the King&#x27;s indignation regarding imperial military operations in his own duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken, Stenbock returned empty-handed. In September 1696 Stenbock parted ways with the Margrave and the imperial army.

===Marriage and family===
During his stay in Stockholm in 1686, Stenbock courted Eva Magdalena Oxenstierna, daughter of Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna, President of the Privy Council Chancellery, and Magdalena Stenbock, a politically active countess. Magnus and Eva exchanged letters during his garrison service in Stade and in the Netherlands. Their affections were conveyed, on behalf of Stenbock, by his mother, and on behalf of Eva Oxenstierna, by both her parents and her older brother Bengt. He sent her a written proposal of marriage on 11 January 1689. As part of the arrangement, Stenbock sent his first self-portrait to her on 29 March 1689. Eva accepted his proposal in late spring, when Stenbock received the portrait of Eva from her brother Bengt. In November Stenbock traveled to Stockholm to meet his future wife. The wedding took place on 23 March 1690, with the members of the Privy Council and the royal family participating. Stenbock became a favorite of Charles XI, and particularly of Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Stenbock&#x27;s parents-in-law would assist him in his future career, including his imperial employment and his appointments as colonel in several Swedish regiments. Bengt Oxenstierna also used him for diplomatic assignments, to secure his influence on Swedish foreign affairs.

Magnus Stenbock and Eva Oxenstierna were married for twenty-seven years, but because of Stenbock&#x27;s military service, the couple only lived together for seven years. Nevertheless, they maintained a regular correspondence and Eva visited Stenbock several times in army camps. During the first ten years of their marriage they lived off Stenbock&#x27;s poor officers&#x27; salary, but during the early 18th century, Stenbock was able to collect a fortune. He sent the money, along with expensive interior decors, to Eva, which she used to buy and decorate several estates. As a landowner in Sweden, she supervised the family&#x27;s finances and the children&#x27;s upbringing.

They had eleven children, of which five sons and two daughters reached adulthood:
* Gösta Otto Stenbock (1691–1693)
* Ulrika Magdalena Stenbock (1692–1715)
* Bengt Ludvig Stenbock (1694–1737)
* Fredrik Magnus Stenbock (1696–1745)
* Johan Gabriel Stenbock (1698–1699)
* Carl Fredrik Stenbock (1700)
* Carl Magnusson Stenbock (1701–1746)
* Erik Magnusson Stenbock (1706)
* Johan Magnusson Stenbock (1709–1754)
* Eva Charlotta Stenbock (1710–1785)
* Gustaf Leonard Stenbock (1711–1758)
The oldest daughter, Ulrika Magdalena, married Admiral Carl Wachtmeister, while the youngest, Eva Charlotta, married Christian Barnekow, the governor of Kristianstad County. Stenbock&#x27;s four oldest sons pursued military careers, while the youngest, Gustaf Leonard, became a judge and vice governor of Kronoberg County. The older sons, Bengt Ludvig and Fredrik Magnus, made their joint peregrination from the Netherlands to Paris in 1712 and were presented to King Louis XIV by the Duke of Noailles and Erik Sparre. Bengt Ludvig left his military career when he inherited and moved to the Kolk estate in Estonia, where he became a noble councillor. Contemporary descendants of Magnus Stenbock originate from his sons Fredrik Magnus and Gustaf Leonard.

==Regimental commander (1695–1700)==

During his military service, Stenbock suffered from growing economic problems. He was forced to support the needs of his family in Frankfurt by sending money exchanges. Stenbock visited Kassel, where he was invited to a princely masquerade ball and received gifts from Landgrave Charles I and his son, Prince Frederick. The Landgrave offered Stenbock a commission as equerry and colonel for a Hessian infantry regiment, but Stenbock rejected the Landgrave&#x27;s offer for fear of his position with Charles XI. In January 1697 Stenbock courted Elector Frederick III at his court in Berlin to collect an old debt sent by his father to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1655. After Stenbock&#x27;s audience with the Elector half of the debt was repaid, and Stenbock received the remaining 6,000 riksdaler as a deposit for a later time. He sent most of his compensation to Berlin as a money exchange to his wife. He then returned to Stade to prepare for the family&#x27;s arrival, but due to sickness and economic problems, the family was forced to remain in Frankfurt.

Charles XI died in April 1697 and was succeeded on the Swedish throne by his son, Charles XII. At the end of May 1697, the young king appointed Stenbock to succeed Jakob von Kemphen as regimental colonel and commandant in Wismar. After redeeming a wage claim of 3,000 riksdaler at the imperial court in Vienna, Stenbock could pay his family&#x27;s debts to creditors in Frankfurt and in August the family moved into the commandant&#x27;s residence in Wismar. As commandant, Stenbock was responsible for the repair of Wismar&#x27;s defenses. His regiment in the city consisted of about 1,000 German infantry recruits. Stenbock also spent time writing a war manual called &quot;Den svenska knekteskolan&quot; (The Swedish Soldier&#x27;s School), which described different infantry tactics, march techniques, the use of military barriers, and basic fortification; he never published it. On 2 January 1699 Stenbock was appointed colonel of the Kalmar Regiment. A few weeks later, Stenbock and his family moved to the colonel&#x27;s residence of Kronobäck in Småland. On 16 February 1700, Stenbock was appointed colonel of the Dalarna Regiment by the King. This was made possible thanks to Count Carl Piper, after his wife Christina Piper&#x27;s recommendation, when Magdalena Stenbock gave Christina a pair of precious earrings. Before Stenbock was able to move into his new colonel&#x27;s residence in Näs Kungsgård, close to the Dalälven, his regiment received orders to mobilize and march south to Scania, at the start of the Great Northern War.

==Great Northern War (1700–1713)==
===Campaign in Denmark and the Baltics===

The Great Northern War began on 12 February 1700, when the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, August II, besieged the city of Riga in Swedish Livonia. Simultaneously, King Frederick IV of Denmark ordered his Danish troops to invade Holstein-Gottorp. Russia entered the war on August the same year, and on September, Russian troops under Tsar Peter I invaded Swedish Ingria and besieged the outpost of Narva in Estonia.

Stenbock was ordered to immediately join his regiment that was marching towards Scania. He arranged field equipment in Stockholm and joined his regiment in Köping. Stenbock bid farewell to his family in Växjö, and his regiment arrived at Landskrona in July to await embarkation for further transport to Zealand. On 25 July Swedish troops led by the King landed at Humlebæk, where the Danish defenders were quickly routed, and the Swedes established a bridgehead on Zealand. Two weeks after the landing, Stenbock and the Dalarna Regiment arrived on Zealand, strengthening the Swedish force there to about 10,000 men. This forced Frederick IV to withdraw from the war on 8 August 1700 with the treaty of Traventhal. Stenbock and his regiment were shipped back to Scania in late August.

In early October, Stenbock sailed with the Dalarna Regiment to Pernau, and joined Charles XII and the Swedish main army marching towards Narva. On 20 November, the Swedish army arrived at the outskirts of Narva. Through reconnaissance the Swedes learned that the Russians, who were about 30,000 strong including thousands of camp followers, had built a fortification system in a semicircle between the north and south sides of the city. Lieutenant general Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld took command of the army. He drafted a battle plan where two Swedish columns would attack and break through the fortification line, and each column would then move to the south and north along the line and roll up the Russian defense so that the Russian army would be trapped in two pockets against the Narva River. Rehnskiöld himself commanded the left column while General Otto Vellingk commanded the right column. Within Rehnskiöld&#x27;s column, Stenbock was appointed to command an advance guard of 516 men, consisting of about fifty grenadiers, a battalion of dalcarlians (soldiers of the Dalarna Regiment) and a supporting battalion from a Finnish regiment. Stenbock and his troops spearheaded the first wave of Swedish attacks.

The Battle of Narva took place on the afternoon of 20 November. The two Swedish columns, hidden by a heavy snowstorm that blew directly into the eyes of the Russians, breached the Russian fortifications. The breakthroughs caused panic among the Russian troops, and after a wild rout the Russian army surrendered and were allowed to withdraw back to Russia. About 9,000 Russian soldiers died during the battle, and their entire command was captured, while the Swedish casualties were estimated to be around 1,900. Among Stenbock&#x27;s troops, about 60 were killed and 149 were severely wounded; Stenbock himself was hit in the leg by a musket ball. The commander of the Russian army, Duke Charles Eugène de Croÿ, and several senior officers surrendered themselves to Stenbock, who personally brought them to the King&#x27;s camp as prisoners of war.

Stenbock was bedridden for two weeks after the battle. Just a few days later, Charles XII visited his sickbed, congratulated Stenbock for his bravery and promoted him to major general of infantry. During December, the main Swedish army overwintered outside the town of Dorpat and the dilapidated Laiuse Castle. On the way to the castle, Stenbock accompanied the state secretary Carl Piper in his wagon, which meant that Stenbock now stood in the King&#x27;s innermost circle. On 25 December Charles XII ordered Stenbock to take 600 men and four cannons into Russian territory, with the aim of occupying the city of Gdov on the other side of Lake Peipus. On 29 December Stenbock started his march with 300 Finnish cavalry units and an equal number of infantry units, mostly dalcarlians travelling on sleds with five men each. After five days they encountered an advance guard of about 300 Russian dragoons. With the help of his field artillery, Stenbock repelled the Russian attacks and continued his march. During the night after the battle, Stenbock and his troops were hit by a blizzard. The combination of overwhelming Russian troops deployed around them and the persistent cold weather forced Stenbock to retreat to Estonian soil. He burned down villages in the area surrounding Gdov and, after several skirmishes with Russian troops, returned to the main Swedish army on 6 January 1701. Upon return to the royal camp, only 100 of his 600 men were combat effective.

Throughout the winter and spring of 1701 Stenbock courted Charles XII and maintained his regiment. On 28 January the Swedish army command gathered in Stenbock&#x27;s quarters at the Laisholm estate, where Stenbock and his regiment arranged a large feast and a theater performance, with songs celebrating Charles XII and his victory at Narva. At this time, Stenbock was nicknamed &quot;Måns Bock&quot; (Måns the buck), &quot;Måns Lurifax&quot; (Måns the sly dog) and &quot;Bocken&quot; (billy goat) by Charles XII. On 8 March Stenbock arranged a snowball fight where hundreds of soldiers fought against each other in a simulated siege, later concluding with Stenbock exercising his dalcarlians in front of the King. Stenbock&#x27;s ventures were highly appreciated by the King, who awarded him with a magnificent horse and appointed him general drill instructor to every infantry regiment during the winter break. His drills laid the foundation for a new infantry regulation issued during the spring of 1701. Stenbock was also praised by Bengt Oxenstierna, who in letters to Stenbock urged him to offer advice to the King, and to persuade him to commence peace talks with the hostile states to sustain the balance of power in Europe.

===Campaign in Poland===
With reinforcements from the Swedish mainland, the Swedish main army broke camp in June and marched south towards Riga to confront King Augustus II&#x27;s Saxon and Russian troops. By 7 July the army was outside Riga. Charles XII and Rehnskiöld planned to cross the Daugava river right next to the city and assault Augustus II troops on the opposite shore. In the Swedish battle plan, drafted by Rehnskiöld, Carl Magnus Stuart and Erik Dahlbergh, the troops were ordered to collect landing boats near Riga and construct floating batteries. The batteries would convey infantry units across the river to establish a bridgehead. During the operation on 9 July, Stenbock assisted in the construction of a floating bridge to allow the cavalry to cross the river. However, strong currents caused the floating bridge to be destroyed, and by the time it was repaired it was too late to influence the outcome of the battle. The main army occupied Courland and overwintered at the castle of Würgen outside of Libau.

Since Charles XII failed to defeat Augustus II during the Daugava operation, he decided to carry out a military campaign on Polish territory to defeat Augustus&#x27; army, and secure his own back before attacking Russia. Stenbock received a memorandum regarding the war situation and Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy from Bengt Oxenstierna, who shortly before his death, entrusted Stenbock to present it to Charles XII and persuade the King to end his campaign against Augustus II and instead direct his attention towards the Russian border. However, Charles XII went his own way and, by the end of January 1702, the Swedish main army had entered the Lithuanian part of Poland. Charles XII marched against Warsaw with the bulk of his army, while Stenbock and the Dalarna Regiment were sent to Vilnius in March along with major general Carl Mörner and the Östergötland Cavalry Regiment. Stenbock and Mörner was tasked with hunting down the troops of Grzegorz Antoni Ogiński and Michał Serwacy Wiśniowiecki, and with collecting contributions for the main army&#x27;s maintenance. Vilnius was taken during late March, and the Swedish garrison was subsequently reinforced. During the Battle of Vilnius on 6 April the garrison was overwhelmed by Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s troops. However, following vicious fighting inside the city, the attackers were repelled with the loss of 100 men, while the Swedish garrison lost 50 men.

Mörner and Stenbock were ordered to bring their 4,000 troops from Vilnius to Warsaw. The march across central Poland was obstructed by skirmishes against Wiśniowiecki&#x27;s troops and wide rivers. On several occasions Stenbock used his engineering skills to build bridges, and the Dalarna Regiment served as sappers both in Stenbock&#x27;s and Charles XII&#x27;s marches. In July 1702 Charles XII and his main army caught up with Augustus II at the village of Kliszów, northeast of Kraków. Mörner and Stenbock reunited with the main army on the evening of 8 July. On the following morning Charles XII attacked Augustus II&#x27;s Saxon and Polish troops. Stenbock was stationed with the infantry on the center of the first line of attack, under the command of lieutenant general Bernhard von Liewen. When Saxon and Polish cavalry attacked the Swedish left wing, Charles XII reinforced it with some cavalry squadrons and with Stenbock and the Dalarna Regiment. The cavalry attack was repulsed, and the Swedish main forces advanced into the Saxon camp, took control of the Saxon artillery, and threatened to encircle the Saxon center. Augustus II was forced to retreat, and lost about 4,000 men, while the Swedish losses were estimated at 1,100. Later, Stenbock recalled the battle as the most difficult he had ever experienced.

After the battle of Kliszów, Charles XII spread his troops around Kraków to cut off Augustus II&#x27;s line of retreat. But since Augustus II was already far away from the area, Charles XII decided to take Kraków. He sent Stenbock with a contingent of dalcarlians and cavalry units from the Småland Cavalry Regiment to scout the city, and ordered Stenbock to persuade its commandant, starost Franciszek Wielopolski, to open the city gates. During Stenbock&#x27;s advance on 1 August, his troops were bombarded by cannon from the city walls, killing six of his cavalry. A squad managed to reach the city gate, and Stenbock negotiated with Wielopolski, who refused to give up Kraków. Charles XII arrived with a contingent of Life Guards. After a short battle, Charles XII and Stenbock broke into the city, killing its sentries, and captured Wielopolski.

As a token of appreciation, Stenbock was appointed Commandant of Kraków. He was commissioned to collect a contribution of 60,000 riksdaler from its citizens. In two days Stenbock&#x27;s patrols collected the entire amount, including large amounts of cattle and grain. Pleased with his effort, Charles XII donated 4,000 riksdaler from the contribution to Stenbock as a personal gift and assigned him the role of &quot;le Diable de la Ville&quot; (the Devil of the city). Stenbock was installed at the Wawel Castle and became the highest Swedish representative in Kraków. During his stay, Stenbock maintained a fitting banquet for the King, his generals and foreign envoys, and sent regular deliveries of spoils and gifts back to his wife in Stockholm.

====Director of the General War Commissariat====
On 18 August 1702 Stenbock was appointed to succeed Anders Lagercrona as director of the newly established General War Commissariat, and became responsible for the main army&#x27;s food supply. With the help of war commissary Jöran Adlersteen, Stenbock decentralized the maintenance of the Swedish troops by appointing a commissary to each regiment, to monitor and record the collection of supplies. On 19 October Stenbock was ordered to personally command a contingent of 3,000 men to Galicia southeast of Kraków. His task was to collect substantial contributions, and to force the local magnate Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski and other Polish nobles to renounce their allegiance to Augustus. He sent war commissars with proclamations about his collection to the villages and cities around Galicia, but when several commissars returned empty handed, Stenbock took severe measures. On 28 October he set an example by burning down the city of Pilzno. Between November and December the villages of Dębica, Wysoka, Wesola and Dub were burned on Stenbock&#x27;s orders, acknowledged by Charles XII in their letter correspondence. In December Stenbock executed an expedition south to Krosno, but he soon returned to Reschow and travelled on to Jarosław. In January 1703, he continued across Oleszyce and Uhniv to Belz, and in February he passed Tyszowce and arrived at the fortified city of Zamość. Since he lacked troops and siege artillery to attack the city, he continued to Chełm and rejoined the main army in Warsaw on 28 February. From Galicia, Stenbock collected over 300,000 riksdaler, including seventy wagons loaded with grain, slaughtered cattle and clothes. Stenbock filled his own coffers with church silver, which he sent with personal greetings to churches and friends in Sweden. Stenbock&#x27;s expedition led to a strong anti-Swedish sentiment amongst the Galician nobility, a mood which over the years continued to grow throughout Poland.

On 21 April 1703 Stenbock participated, along with Charles XII, in the Battle of Pułtusk against the Saxon Field Marshal Adam Heinrich von Steinau. On May of that year, Charles XII laid siege to Thorn on the Weichsel river. Since he lacked siege artillery, Charles XII ordered cannons and equipment from Riga and Stockholm, which had to pass through Danzig at the mouth of the Weichsel. Stenbock was sent incognito to Danzig to negotiate with the city&#x27;s magistrate free passage for the Swedish transport vessels. At the end of July the transport fleet from Riga arrived at Danzig with 4,000 Swedish and Finnish recruits. Even though Stenbock was granted a contribution of 100,000 riksdaler, the city refused to open its harbor barriers for the Swedish vessels and Stenbock was forced to transport the siege artillery by land. He arrived at the Swedish field camp at Thorn with the artillery at the end of August. The city was bombarded during the autumn and, on 3 October, the city&#x27;s garrison surrendered to Charles XII. In December a new conflict with Danzig was triggered by Stenbock attempting to recruit troops around the area, even though freedom from enlistment was one of Danzig&#x27;s privileges. However, Charles XII demanded that recruitment must be allowed, and the city submitted to his demands in January 1704. Subsequently, the King further demanded a refund of 15,000 silver marks which the exiled Charles VIII of Sweden offered to the city nearly 250 years earlier in return for fishing revenue from Putzig. Members of the Gyllenstierna family had already presented the demands as heirs to Charles VIII the previous year, and Stenbock and the King returned to Danzig to press Gyllenstierna&#x27;s demands. Eventually the city relented and paid 136,000 riksdaler in exchange for a letter of safe conduct from Charles XII.

In 1704 Stenbock was commissioned to set up his own dragoon regiment of 600 men, which was expanded to 1,000 men in 1707. At the end of August 1704 Stenbock accompanied the King during the occupation and plundering of Lemberg in southeast Poland. During Charles XII&#x27;s continued campaign against Augustus II, Stenbock commanded the King&#x27;s vanguard, comprising the Dalarna Regiment and other regiments. He was also tasked with collecting contributions and establishing supply depots. On the way to Warsaw, he burned down the city of Krasnystaw. The main army overwintered around Rawicz near the border of Silesia, where Stenbock was responsible for accommodation and provisioning. On 4 November Stenbock was promoted to lieutenant general of infantry, which he regarded as an important acknowledgment. On 15 November Stenbock&#x27;s mother Christina Catharina died and he inherited Vapnö Castle.

During the winter months between 1705 and 1706, Stenbock accompanied Charles XII and the main army in the blockade of Grodno in Polish Livonia, which was occupied by a Russian army under the command of Georg Benedict von Ogilvy. In August 1706, Stenbock marched with Charles XII and the main army into Saxony for a final resolution with Augustus II. On 14 September the treaty of Altranstädt was signed. Augustus II was forced to break all ties with his allies, renounce his claims to the Polish crown, and accept Stanisław I Leszczyński as the new King. The Swedish army stayed in Saxony for a year, where Charles XII prepared and mobilized his army to go east and fight against Russia, though this time without Stenbock. Earlier in July Stenbock had been promoted to general of infantry and had succeeded Carl Gustav Rehnskiöld as Governor-General of Scania on 25 December 1705. In April 1707 he held his last audience with Charles XII; on his way home to Sweden he visited the health resort of Karlsbad in Bohemia to treat his kidney stone disease.

===Governor-General of Scania===
On 4 June 1707, Stenbock arrived in Malmö and reunited with his family at Rånäs Manor, which his wife acquired in 1704. He entered the governor&#x27;s post on 18 September. At that time, the province was severely crisis-ridden, partly because it was close to Denmark and was depleted of able-bodied men throughout the war, and partly because of administrative mismanagement. Stenbock&#x27;s predecessor, Rehnskiöld, had remained outside of the province since the outbreak of the war in 1700, and hence Scania&#x27;s administration had passed over to the deputy-governor, Axel von Faltzburg. von Faltzburg was considered an invisible leader due to his weakness, corruption and disinterest, so administrative responsibilities were distributed between various bailiffs and officials, who spent their time in turf wars, despoilments and arbitrary exercises of power, which angered the Scanian peasantry.

Stenbock&#x27;s first act was to inspect the provincial office reports, where he discovered that the financial accounting was in disarray and that the urbaria had not been updated for over 20 years. He replaced von Faltzburg with his own family companion and accountant, Peter Malmberg. In October and November 1707 Stenbock undertook an extended inspection tour across Scania, to obtain fresh recruits and form an opinion of the situation in the province. He was told that the peasants were pressured to pay unreasonably high taxes by the officials, whose ruthless conduct had caused over a thousand rural settlements to lay desolated. Stenbock reported on the situation to the Privy Council in Stockholm, suggesting that a state commission of inquiry should be assigned in Scania to investigate accusations of corruption. The Privy Council approved his proposal in February 1708, which resulted in several corrupt officials being discharged and arrested. In addition to his work within the commission of inquiry, which occupied much of his time, Stenbock combated shifting sand afflicting coastal farms, erected milestones on the royal highways, planted trees to resolve the growing shortage of wood, and hired land surveyors for the necessary provincial measurement.

Stenbock spent his time with his family in various properties and estates: in the governor&#x27;s residence in Malmö which was used for representation; in the crown&#x27;s property of Börringe in Scania; in Rånäs, where the couple controlled a huge farm and built a new mansion; and in Vapnö, where Stenbock spent his time with artistic activities and his wife took care of the daily operation of the estate and its stud farm, and established a wallpaper printing house where they produced wallpaper for sale. The couple congregated with Scanian landlords during dinners and hunting parties. Stenbock visited the mineral spa in the village of Ramlösa, which was inaugurated as a health resort on 17 June 1707 by the provincial physician of Scania, Johan Jacob Döbelius. Since the source of the well, according to Döbelius, had a medicinal effect, Stenbock saw a personal incentive to support it, since he suffered from kidney stone disease. Stenbock supported ground clearance around the spa and its decoration.

On the late summer of 1709, Stenbock received recurring reports from Envoy Anders Leijonkloo regarding a rapid increase of Danish military activity in Copenhagen, with Danish warships being loaded with troops and supplies. These signs suggested that the Danes were preparing for an invasion.

===War in Skåneland===

News of the disastrous defeat of Charles XII at the hands of Peter I and his army at the battle of Poltava in Ukraine, on 28 June 1709, spread across the Swedish empire throughout that summer. Charles XII escaped across the border to the Ottoman Empire, accompanied by roughly 1,000 men, but the remnants of his army surrendered at the village of Perevolochna near the Dnieper river. The defeats at Poltava and Perevolochna resulted in the deaths of 7,000 Swedish soldiers and the capture of 23,000 soldiers and non-combatants. With the Swedish main army destroyed, Denmark and Saxony returned to the war, forming a new coalition against Sweden. Saxon troops entered Poland to recapture the royal crown of Augustus II, whilst Danish-Norwegian troops under Frederick IV invaded Scania and Bohuslän.

After receiving Leijonkloo&#x27;s reports of Danish rearmament, Stenbock summoned a meeting with several dignitaries from Malmö. He urged that the city&#x27;s defenses must be strengthened and food and reinforcements acquired in preparation for a siege, since Malmö formed a strategic key point for the dominion of Scania and the defense of the Swedish mainland. Landskrona was also in need of reinforcement, and Stenbock appealed that a provisional fortress should be built in Kristianstad to prevent the Danes from moving into Blekinge. However, the fortifications of Helsingborg were dilapidated to the extent that the city was deemed impossible to defend. The coastal guard was reinforced, and beacons were erected at Barsebäck, Råå and other exposed stretches along the Öresund coast, where Stenbock expected the Danes would land. Apart from the fortress garrisons, Stenbock had only a few regiments at his disposal, and most of their men were poorly equipped. On 22 August Stenbock reported the Danish threat to the Defense Commission. The commission agreed to send three cavalry regiments from Västergötland to Scania&#x27;s defense, and in October, they reassembled both the Northern and Southern Scanian cavalry regiments, who previously been wiped out at Poltava. Stenbock himself mustered 3,000 fresh troops. In September he issued a general declaration calling the people of Scania to fidelity to the Swedish King, to prevent pro-Danish guerrilla organization and collaboration. On 27 September 1709, Stenbock made an inspired speech to the citizens of Malmö, dispelling their concerns about the loss at Poltava and reminding them of their duty to their King and fatherland. Addressing the people of Scania as brethren, he was prepared to die by their side.

====Danish campaign in Scania and Blekinge====

The Privy Council in Stockholm received the Danish declaration of war on 18 October. By then the fortifications along the Öresund coast had been made moderately defensible, especially in Malmö where the garrison had been expanded to 3,550 men. Three cavalry regiments were positioned along the Öresund coast under Colonel Göran Gyllenstierna&#x27;s command, and both Malmö and Landskrona had enough ammunition and supplies to withstand a six-month siege. On 31 October more than 250 transport vessels sailed from Copenhagen, escorted by 12 warships led by Admiral Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve. The Danish invasion army consisted of 15,000 men with Christian Ditlev Reventlow as commanding general. Stenbock discovered the fleet from Malmö Castle on 1 November, and a signal shot from Landskrona reported that the Danish armada had anchored at Råå. The cavalry regiments marched towards the site and positioned themselves at the villages of Raus, Katslösa and Rya; Stenbock establishing his headquarters at the latter. Upon discovering elite Danish troops at Råå, covered by Danish warships, Stenbock decided to retreat to the southeast, destroying all the bridges along the way. By 5 November the invasion army was in full force, and took Helsingborg without resistance.

In November the Danes occupied central Scania and established supply routes from Ängelholm to Ringsjön. At the end of November, Malmö was blockaded by a Danish contingent of 2,000 men, while Landskrona was encircled in early December. Since the Danes lacked siege artillery, their plan was to starve out the Swedish garrisons. Stenbock was ordered by the Defense Commission to leave Malmö on 9 December to take command of a newly organized Swedish field army, which would march south towards the assembly point at Loshult. The defense of Malmö was handed over to major general Carl Gustaf Skytte and Stenbock left the city on 1 December escorted by a small company. On 7 December he established his headquarters in Kristianstad. Due to problems with supply chains, Stenbock wanted to carry out a rapid campaign to prevent the Danes from establishing a safe base of operations in southern Sweden, but he was ordered by the Defense Commission to hold his positions in northern Scania before the arrival of the Swedish field army. On 3 January 1710 Reventlow began his march towards Kristianstad with a contingent of 6,000 men and eight guns, under orders from Frederick IV to capture Karlskrona and burn the Swedish battle fleet. On Epiphany, Stenbock was briefed of this and ordered his troops from Kristianstad to transport army supplies to Karlshamn and to various villages in Småland. While he organized defenses in Karlshamn with General admiral Hans Wachtmeister and the governors of Blekinge and Kronoberg counties, he handed over the command of the troops to Göran Gyllenstierna, who positioned the troops at fords and strategic points along the Helge River. The position at Torsebro was attacked by Danish troops on 13 January. Gyllenstierna was forced to retreat, and his rearguard fought against Danish cavalry units at Fjälkinge. After the battle, about 60 Swedes were killed and an entire battalion from the Saxon infantry regiment was captured. Eastern Scania and several Swedish food stores ended up in Danish hands.

Stenbock gathered his remaining troops and established his headquarters in Mörrum. There he received permission from the Defense Commission to organize levy recruits on 17 January, and received free rein to attack when the opportunity was favorable. The troops gathered in Ronneby on 18 January, whence the infantry was sent to Karlskrona&#x27;s defense. Gyllenstierna was assigned a cavalry contingent and was ordered to destroy bridges and obstruct Danish movements in Blekinge. On 20 January Stenbock went to Växjö to assemble the field army, since Loshult was considered an insecure assembly point. On 19 January, Reventlow entered Blekinge and conquered Karlshamn, seizing supplies and 12,000 riksdaler from its citizens. The Danes withdrew on 24 January and established winter quarters from Ängelholm to Sölvesborg. On 21 January, Stenbock arrived in Växjö, where he met with lieutenant general Jacob Burensköld, some companies from Östergötland Infantry Regiment, and 150 levies from Småland. Reinforcements arrived in stages during the next few days, consisting of the newly assembled Uppland, Kronoberg, Jönköping, Kalmar, and Östergötland and Södermanland infantry regiments, as well as Adelsfanan, Horse Life Regiment, Småland and Östergötland cavalry regiments. The army was well-equipped but was short of swords and several soldiers lacked basic uniforms. On 31 January, Stenbock broke camp and a few days later his army encamped at Osby. On 8 February, major general Christian Ludvig von Ascheberg joined the army along with the Älvsborg Regiment, Saxon Infantry Regiment and Queen Dowager of the Realm&#x27;s Horse Life Regiment, as well as bringing field guns and several ammunition wagons. On 11 February, Gyllenstierna arrived with his three cavalry regiments from Blekinge. Stenbock was now in command of 19 regiments and about 16,000 men.

====Swedish counteroffensive and the Battle of Helsingborg====

On 12 February, the army broke camp at Osby and marched south. The same day Swedish troops met with a Danish reconnaissance patrol of 200 cavalry units under lieutenant general Jørgen Rantzau in the forests of Hästveda. After a short and confused battle, the Danes withdrew with the loss of forty soldiers, while the Swedes lost between three and ten. When Reventlow was informed, he decided to retreat with his troops to Vä and later to Skarhult. Stenbock&#x27;s movements were a diversion, as he had divided his field army into two columns that marched towards Hästveda and Glimminge, to trick Reventlow by threatening his headquarters in Kristianstad and force him to retreat to Helsingborg. Reventlow, however, marched south to Barsebäck, where the Danes had a good retreat route across the strait and could continue their encirclement of Malmö and control the southern plains of Scania. During a night-time reconnaissance at Ringsjön, Reventlow caught a severe cold and high fever, and he appointed lieutenant general Rantzau as his deputy on 17 February.

On 18 February, Stenbock crossed the River Rönne at Forestad and Hasslebro. At Trollenäs Castle, the Uppland cavalry regiment encountered 300 Danish dragoons, who withdrew after a short battle. The next day, Rantzau positioned his army at Roslöv north of Flyinge, and ordered the troops besieging Malmö to withdraw immediately. After an emergency meeting with his generals on 19 February, Rantzau ordered his troops to return to Helsingborg. When Stenbock was informed that the Danes had passed Stora Harrie, he decided to pursue them and divided his army into five columns. On 20 February, Stenbock&#x27;s cavalry encountered the Danish rearguard at Asmundtorp, but Stenbock called them off and withdrew to Annelöv and Norrvidinge, since the cover of darkness and Danish shelling halted the Swedish advance. Stenbock himself galloped to Malmö to resupply, and on 24 February he returned to the army with food, reinforcements and 24 artillery pieces. He was informed that the Danes had made battle preparations at Helsingborg and, following a council of war with the high command, Stenbock decided to seek a confrontation with the Danes. His troops decamped from Norrvidinge on 26 February and made an evasive movement towards the heights north of Helsingborg, setting up camp at Fleninge Church the following day. Stenbock established his headquarters in Hjälmshults kungsgård a few kilometers west. The troops prepared to march at midnight and carried out an evasive movement south through Ödåkra and Pilshult.

On the morning of 28 February Rantzau and the Danish army of 14,000 men and 32 guns were positioned on a front which stretched north to south from Pålsjö forest and the Ringstorp Height to Husensjö. The troops were protected by impassable semi-frozen marshlands. Stenbock&#x27;s army of 14,000 men and 36 guns was formed in a line between Senderöd and Brohuset. To get past the marshlands, Stenbock made a very time-consuming maneuver that finally placed the Swedish left wing between Brohuset and Filborna. Stenbock&#x27;s maneuver succeeded in causing the Danes to leave their favorable position to avoid encirclement. Rantzau ordered the Danish right wing to advance, which started a furious cavalry fight. The Swedish cavalry suffered heavy casualties, but since the Danish right wing advanced too quickly, the Danish infantry and artillery fell behind. When they subsequently formed a new line of attack, confusion arose among the ranks, and Stenbock discovered a gap between the Danish right wing and center. He ordered an attack against the Danish center, and after heavy resistance the Danish line fell apart. During the battle&#x27;s final stages, the Danes fled to Helsingborg&#x27;s fortifications with Swedish cavalry units in pursuit. After three hours of battle, Danish losses amounted to 1,500 dead, 3,500 wounded and 2,700 prisoners. Among Stenbock&#x27;s troops, 900 were dead and 2,100 were wounded. Lieutenant general Burensköld was captured but was exchanged a few weeks later, and Stenbock injured his back when he fell from his horse in a swamp.

The Danes entrenched themselves in Helsingborg and transported the wounded soldiers, together with the city&#x27;s women and children, to Helsingør. Rantzau handed over command to major general Frantz Joachim von Dewitz. Stenbock refrained from storming the city and on 1 March he installed a battery at Pålsjö beach, which bombarded Danish ship traffic. On 3 March, Stenbock began the bombardment of Helsingborg, destroying much of the city. Frederick IV ordered von Dewitz to evacuate the city immediately and transport the troops to Zealand, and the Danish evacuation began the following day under intense Swedish artillery fire. The Danes burned their carriages, threw away their food stores and slaughtered thousands of horses which they left in the streets, basements and wells of the city. On 5 March, von Dewitz was the last Dane to leave Scania on a boat. At the entrance of the reclaimed city, Stenbock was forced to command farmers to dispose of the horse carcasses, which were buried in mass graves or dumped in the sea. Stenbock left the city on 9 March and reunited with his family in Malmö.

After Stenbock&#x27;s victory at Helsingborg, a heroic cult began to grow around him in the Swedish empire. He received personal congratulations from the Queen Dowager Hedvig Eleonora, Princess Ulrika Eleonora, Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, King Stanisław Leszczyński and the Duke of Marlborough. Stenbock&#x27;s victory was celebrated with tributes and artistic works, and a general thanksgiving ceremony was held on 18 March, where Stenbock&#x27;s name was praised. In April, Stenbock traveled to Stockholm to inform the Privy Council about the new strategic situation. On arrival, he was hailed by the citizens of Stockholm and he held several victory speeches before the clergy and peasant estates. The Riksdag of the Estates offered him the Bååtska palace, and on 21 May the Privy council appointed him field marshal, sending the letter of appointment to Charles XII in Bender for the King&#x27;s signature.

===Plague outbreak===
Stenbock&#x27;s field army garrisoned in the Scanian cities and villages, to defend against Danish marines, who looted the coastal villages between Kullen and Barsebäck during the spring. In the summer of 1710 Sweden had a bad harvest, and starving soldiers in Scania were forced to steal food from the peasants. Stenbock could not maintain their discipline and demanded food deliveries from other parts of the Kingdom. At the same time, he received news from Stockholm and Blekinge about strange deaths. On 10 September the Privy Council sent a message to all governors that Stockholm was suffering from a severe infection that was killing people by the hundreds. The Collegium Medicum determined that the epidemic in Stockholm was the bubonic plague, that had ravaged the southern and eastern coasts of the Baltic Sea since autumn 1708. These signs forced Stenbock to isolate the entire Scanian region to keep the epidemic at bay. On 28 October armed barricades were placed on the major highways to Scania from Halland, Småland and Blekinge, and sentries were posted at Margretetorp, Markaryd and Kivik. Smoking stations were erected at the barricades and travelers to Scania were forced to present a valid bill of health and to allow their belongings to be fumigated with cleansing herbs before they could enter. Letters from postal offices were also fumigated. Between 1710 and 1713, 100,000 people in Sweden succumbed to the plague, of which 20,000 were in Stockholm. Thousands of people died in Scania, mainly in Göinge and the northeastern parts of the region, while neighboring villages were free from plague-related deaths.

===Royal Councillor===
In February 1711 Stenbock received a royal order from Charles XII to resign from his governor post and install himself in Stockholm as Royal Councillor and member of the Privy Council. His letter of appointment as field marshal was omitted and Burensköld was appointed as the new governor. Stenbock regarded this as an insulting downgrade, partly because, due to the Kingdom&#x27;s poor economic state, he would now receive an uncertain salary as royal councillor compared to his stable income and benefits as Scanian governor, and partly because, unlike his subordinate generals, he was not promoted after the victory at Helsingborg. However, Stenbock would still be responsible for Scania&#x27;s border defense, and received a royal order to build fortifications outside Barsebäck, Höganäs and Mölle, as well as a mound at Råå. Between 1711 and 1712 Stenbock was appointed chancellor of Lund University.

In Bender, Charles XII made revenge plans against Russia, and convinced the Ottoman government in the Sublime Porte to ally with Sweden. He gave orders to the Privy Council to send a field army to Pomerania, which would enter Poland from the west, while Charles XII would march from the south in command of an Ottoman army. The united armies would once again dethrone Augustus II, march against Moscow, and force Denmark to an unfavorable peace treaty. Council President Arvid Horn and Field Marshal Nils Gyllenstierna opposed the King&#x27;s plans and, in spring 1710 ratified a declaration of neutrality with the Western powers of Europe in The Hague, favoring the Swedish dominions in Germany. Since Charles XII regarded Horn as unreliable, he entrusted Stenbock with putting together and overseeing a new field army. In his first council session in April 1711 Stenbock pleaded for the King&#x27;s order, which was criticized by Horn and several other council members. Stenbock was supported in this matter by Hans Wachtmeister and Stanisław Leszczyński, who had sought protection in Swedish Pomerania, and was granted an annual appanage by the King, a decision which angered the council. When Denmark, Russia and Saxony learned of Charles XII&#x27;s dismissive attitude towards the declaration of neutrality, a Danish army of 30,000 men entered Pomerania through Mecklenburg in August 1711, while Saxon troops marched from the south. Frederick IV and Augustus II converged outside of Stralsund, to which they later laid siege. King Stanisław traveled to Sweden, met with Stenbock in Kristianstad, and went to the Privy Council to ask for reinforcements.

The Privy Council agreed to send four infantry regiments of 4,000 men to Stralsund&#x27;s defense. With the council&#x27;s approval, Stenbock traveled to Karlskrona in October to assist Wachtmeister with the preparations and execution of the troop transport. The transport fleet sailed on 24 November and a few days later the troops were debarked at Perd on the island of Rügen. Stralsund&#x27;s commandant, lieutenant general Carl Gustaf Dücker, regarded these reinforcements as less than he had hoped for, since he was informed that the Danes and the Saxons would carry out a major offensive the following year. Stenbock returned to Karlskrona in early December, and at Christmas received a royal order to guard the Swedish west coast, while lieutenant general Gustaf Adam Taube would lead Scania&#x27;s defense in Stenbock&#x27;s absence.

===Order of mobilization===

In Gothenburg, on 19 May 1712, Stenbock received a new order from Charles XII, this time that he would immediately transport a field army to Pomerania. He was authorized to carry out the transport independently of the Privy Council. He would also submit to King Stanisław Leszczyński and consult with Mauritz Vellingk, who was now governor of Bremen-Verden and commanding general of the Swedish troops in Germany. Stenbock and King Stanisław were to organize the transport in consultation with Wachtmeister and the Admiralty in Karlskrona.

In mid-June 1712 Stenbock spoke with King Stanisław and the council members Horn and Gyllenstierna in Vadstena, where he presented the financial requirements from Karlskrona for a contribution of 200,000 daler silver coins and 1,500 experienced sailors. Horn and Gyllenstierna were able to obtain only a quarter of the requested amount, citing the Kingdom&#x27;s general distress and shortage of funds. Stenbock accompanied them to Stockholm and together with Gustaf Cronhielm, Stenbock spoke with the head of the Agency for Public Management to find out about the Kingdom&#x27;s financial situation. Together they set up a financing proposal that would address the population with appeals for money loans, mainly from the wealthier subjects. Throughout July, Stenbock undertook his borrowing campaign by sending letters to the Swedish governors and magistrates, and holding speeches and banquets in Stockholm. He appealed to the bourgeoisie for money and cargo vessels to bring the King back to Sweden, as well as to improve the badly damaged Swedish foreign trade. In a short time, Stenbock and his helpers collected 400,000 daler and a loan of nine double-decked bulk carriers. With this contribution, the Swedish high command was able to send decampment orders to the regiments, purchase grain, muster sailors and assemble a transport fleet in Karlskrona at the end of July, while the war fleet was made combat-ready.

Stenbock left Stockholm and spent a week in Vapnö to say goodbye to his family. In August, Wachtmeister sailed with a fleet of 27 warships from Karlskrona. Stenbock joined the transport fleet at anchor in Karlshamn on 23 August, and set sail for Rügen. The following day, Wachtmeister chased off a Danish fleet led by Admiral Gyldenløve, who retreated to Copenhagen, while Wachtmeister dropped anchor in Køge Bugt.

===Campaign in Northern Germany===

On 25 August Stenbock landed at Wittow on the north coast of Rügen and toured for the next few days between Stralsund and various places on Rügen. On 14 September the rest of the transport fleet anchored at Wittow, and two days later, 9,500 men and twenty guns disembarked from the ships. Most of the troops were accommodated on Rügen, while some were sent to Stralsund. On the night between 18 and 19 September, the transport fleet that was anchored at Langkenhoff suffered a surprise attack from Gyldenløve&#x27;s fleet, who bypassed Wachtmeister&#x27;s battle fleet. Over 50 Swedish transport ships were lost during the attack, half of which were captured by the Danes, and most of the winter storages were lost.

The loss of the transport fleet was a major logistical problem for Stenbock and the Swedish troops in Germany. Stenbock sent a message to the Privy Council to send a new transport fleet with fresh winter supplies and 4,000 cavalry units that had not yet been transported from Sweden. Meanwhile, Stenbock was ordered by King Stanisław to begin secret negotiations with the Saxon Field Marshal Jacob Heinrich von Flemming to investigate the possibility of a separate peace with King Augustus II. The meeting took place on 11 October in Pütte, west of Stralsund, where Stenbock, together with major generals Georg Reinhold Patkul and Fredrik von Mevius, negotiated with Flemming and his companions, the Russian Master-General of the Ordnance Jacob Bruce and the Danish colonels Bendix Meyer and Poul Vendelbo Løvenørn. Because Flemming rejected King Stanisław&#x27;s demands regarding Lithuania the negotiations were inconclusive. Stenbock held a council of war with his generals and colonels to decide by which route they should march. Since the road to Poland was devastated and blocked by between 20,000 and 30,000 Russian and Saxon troops, Stenbock decided to go west to Mecklenburg where the troops could establish reliable supply lines.

On 1 November, 16,000 men marched out of Stralsund under Stenbock&#x27;s direct command. They moved parallel to the enemy lines, which were concentrated south of Stralsund. They crossed the Recknitz river at Damgarten on 4 November, and entered Rostock without a fight ten days later. Stenbock set up headquarters in Schwaan, south of Rostock, and established communications with Wismar. In Mecklenburg, the contribution collection commenced under the command of General War Commissar Peter Malmberg, and the Swedes confiscated significant quantities of food, wagons and horses. At the same time, Danish troops remained around Hamburg and Danish Holstein, while Saxon and Russian troops advanced from the east. On 5 November Stenbock and King Stanisław negotiated with Flemming. Stanisław announced his thoughts on giving up the Polish crown, which created opportunities for an armistice. On 24 November Stenbock was ordered by King Stanisław to discuss a three-month armistice with the enemy alliance. The negotiations, between Stenbock and major general Carl Gustaf Mellin on one side and Flemming, the Russian commander Prince Alexander Menshikov and Colonels Meyer and Løvenørn on the other, took place a few days later in Lüssow. Stenbock was also given the opportunity to discuss directly with Augustus II, who was not a participant at the talks, but as a guest of the widowed duchess Magdalena Sibylla in Güstrow. The parties agreed to a two-week ceasefire, starting on 1 December, which allowed the Swedes to collect food reserves and gave them more time to assemble a new transport fleet. On 29 November, King Stanisław departed towards Bender to inform Charles XII about the negotiations. Stenbock remained in Wismar for two weeks due to severe colic attacks. He was informed that a transport fleet under Admiral Gustaf Wattrang had assembled in Karlskrona and tried to sail to Wismar, but due to frequent storms, the fleet failed three times.

====Battle of Gadebusch====

At the end of the truce, Stenbock was informed that a large Danish army had broken into Mecklenburg from the west and attacked Malmberg&#x27;s supply troops. To prevent the Danes from joining the other allies, Stenbock decided to prepare his army to march. On 15 December, the Swedes destroyed the bridges across the Warnow river, securing the army&#x27;s rear and flanks, and the army moved west the following morning. Two days later, they stopped at Karow, where Stenbock was informed that the Danes encamped at Gadebusch and that Saxon cavalry regiments were about to join them. 16,000 Danish troops had set up camp outside Gadebusch&#x27;s walls under the command of lieutenant general Jobst von Scholten, while King Frederick IV established headquarters in the city&#x27;s castle. On 18 December Stenbock marched against Gadebusch and divided his army into columns. He camped at the Lütken Brütz mansion, east of Gadebusch, on 19 December, where his troops were discovered by Scholten&#x27;s reconnaissance units after midnight. At daybreak the Danish and Swedish troops prepared for combat.


On the morning of 20 December, the Danes took up defensive positions at Wakenstädt, south of Gadebusch, in anticipation of a Swedish attack. In the meantime Flemming arrived with Saxon reinforcements. A total of 16,000 Danes and 3,500 Saxons stood before Stenbock&#x27;s army, which numbered about 14,000. At the advice of the artillery commander Carl Cronstedt, Stenbock let his artillery play an important role in the battle. It was placed in front of the infantry under the protection of one infantry battalion. At from the enemy ranks, the Swedish guns bombarded the Danish line; then they were pulled forward with horses and a new bombardment started. At the beginning of the battle, the Swedish cavalry on the right wing surrounded the Danish cavalry on the left wing. The Danes began to flee backwards, but when they received Saxon reinforcements, the Swedish advance was stopped. The breakthrough left the Danish infantry on the left unprotected. The Swedish infantry advanced in columns and, only when in the immediate vicinity of the enemy, formed a line and opened fire. The Swedish infantry was successful, especially on the right where they penetrated the unprotected Danish cavalry. The Danish infantry sustained heavy losses, but through Saxon reinforcements, the Danish right wing managed to repel the Swedish attacks. The battle faded during dusk and the remaining Danish and Saxon troops withdrew to Holstein. The Swedish cavalry were too exhausted to pursue them. Danish losses amounted to 2,500 dead and injured, while the Saxon losses were between 700 and 900 killed and injured. In addition, 2,500 Danes and 100 Saxons were taken prisoners. Swedish losses came to 550 killed and 1,000 injured.

The exhausted Swedish troops were quartered at various locations between Gadebusch and Wismar, while Stenbock went to Wismar with his prisoners and wounded soldiers. Stenbock&#x27;s victory was celebrated across Sweden, and he received letters of congratulations from the Queen Dowager and Princess of Sweden, Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and King Frederick Wilhelm I of Prussia. In addition, King Louis XIV mentioned Stenbock in his New Year&#x27;s speech before his court in Versailles, and Charles XII ratified Stenbock&#x27;s appointment as Field Marshal. The letter of appointment was issued in January 1713 and arrived with Stenbock in July the same year.

====Burning of Altona====
On 30 December, Stenbock marched across the Trave river into Holstein, to support his troops from there. From his headquarters in Schwartau, he sent proclamations regarding contributions to both the Danish and Ducal parts of Holstein, as well as to the Hanseatic City of Lübeck. He sent orders to Governor General Mauritz Vellingk requesting large quantities of clothing for his troops. Vellingk was posted in Hamburg since September 1712, following the occupation of Stade and Bremen-Verden by Danish troops. As Vellingk wanted to avenge the Danes for their destruction of Stade, he advised Stenbock to march into the Danish part of Holstein to destroy the Danish city of Altona on the Elbe river. On 7 January 1713 Stenbock established his headquarters in Pinneberg, north of Hamburg, while Colonels Ulrich Carl von Bassewitz and Johan Carl Strömfelt were sent to Altona with 200 cavalry and 800 dragoon units. On the following morning Stenbock arrived in Altona and arrested the city&#x27;s provisional bourgeois commission, causing the citizens to negotiate a ransom of 36,000 riksdaler. When Stenbock discussed the matter with Vellingk in Hamburg later that day, the latter argued that Altona must be burned, since the city and its large quantities of food posed a strategic interest for the Allies. Stenbock, however, argued that the city&#x27;s destruction would cause retaliatory action in Swedish Pomerania and Bremen, and that he had promised the people of Holstein that they were safe if they stayed calm and paid contributions. Vellingk warned Stenbock that unless the city was set on fire, he would suffer unpleasant consequences. Stenbock returned to Altona that evening, threatening its citizens that he would burn the city to the ground if they could not give him 100,000 riksdaler before midnight. Even though Bassewitz persuaded Stenbock to reduce the ransom to 50,000 riksdaler, the citizens were unable to collect the sum in such a short time. They panicked and pleaded with Stenbock to spare their lives. Nevertheless, Stenbock left Altona and ordered Strömfelt to burn it down.

On the night between 8 and 9 January the citizens of Altona were dragged out of their homes by Stromfelt&#x27;s dragoons, who then ignited the houses. By the morning of 9 January Altona was transformed into a smoldering ghost town, and hundreds of the citizens died in the flames or froze to death. Only a few hundred of the city&#x27;s 2,000 houses survived the fire. After the destruction, Stenbock sent a letter to government official Ditlev Vibe, stating that he found himself compelled by &quot;justification and an inevitable necessity&quot; to burn down Altona. The Allies sharply criticized Stenbock&#x27;s action. He received a personal letter from Flemming and Scholten expressing their disgust. Stenbock&#x27;s act of violence was difficult to defend since Altona&#x27;s citizens were defenseless and of the same Lutheran-evangelical denomination as the Swedes. He now became a target of anti-Swedish propaganda and a notorious, bloodthirsty arsonist. His actions became widely known as &quot;der Schwedenbrand&quot; (the Swedish Bonfire) or &quot;die Schwedische Einäscherung&quot; (the Swedish Cremation).

In mid-January Danish and Saxon troops approached Hamburg, and a Russian army under Tsar Peter I marched from Mecklenburg towards Holstein. On 18 January, Stenbock and his army crossed the Eider Canal, marched into Schleswig and set up camp in Husum. Cavalry divisions under Bassewitz and Strömfelt were sent to Flensburg and Aabenraa. From there, they reported that the northern roads, following heavy rainfalls, were turned into mud and that the villages and farms in the surrounding area were abandoned and emptied of food and valuables. On 22 January, Stenbock held a council of war, where they agreed to occupy the Eiderstedt peninsula and establish food stores under the protection of Holstein-Gottorp&#x27;s main fortress, Tönning. Following the destruction of Altona Stenbock had entered negotiations with secret envoys from Holstein-Gottorp, which was ruled by Christian August. When the duchy was threatened with destruction by Denmark and its allies, Christian August wanted to use Stenbock&#x27;s army to defend it. A secret treaty, in which the Swedes were guaranteed Tönning&#x27;s protection while they in return would ensure the protection of the Duchy during future peace negotiations with Denmark, was signed by Stenbock, Christian August and Geheimräte Henrik Reventlow, Johan Claesson Banér, and Georg Heinrich von Görtz.

The allied troops crossed the Eider Canal on 23 January, and a few days later Stenbock&#x27;s troops clashed with Russian troops at the bridge of Hollingstedt between Husum and the city of Schleswig. Afterwards Stenbock marched to Eiderstedt, spread his troops around the peninsula, and built small redoubts at strategic locations. At the beginning of February, Danish and Saxon troops commenced their attack from Husum while Russian troops advanced across Friedrichstadt and Koldenbüttel. Stenbock retreated towards Tönning and lost several cannons and food stores to the Allies. The Swedish vanguard entered Tönning on 14 February, and were followed by the rest of the infantry, about 2,000 sick soldiers, and the cavalry, who camped on the plains outside the fortress. Stenbock delegated command of the army to major general Georg Reinhold Patkul and Stackelberg, and, together with the cavalry, Stenbock tried to cross the Eider Canal with boats and obtain reinforcements from Sweden. The ship transport failed due to heavy winds, and Tsar Peter moved towards the Swedish bridgehead with 10,000 Russian troops. Stenbock sounded the retreat and half of his cavalry surrendered to the Russians, while the rest slaughtered their horses and escaped to Tönning.

====Surrender at Tönning====
Inside Tönning&#x27;s walls, 12,000 Swedes were crowded with soldiers and citizens from Holstein. The fortress lacked firewood, food and drinkable water. The Privy Council rejected Stenbock&#x27;s cries of distress, referring to the Kingdom&#x27;s critical situation. From the sea, Tönning was blocked by Danish warships, and Stenbock could not expect any help from Charles XII, since he had been informed by Vellingk that the King had been transferred to Demotika following the skirmish at Bender. The Ottomans could no longer trust Swedish arms when Stenbock, instead of breaking into Poland, chose to negotiate with the enemy. Stenbock began to feel depressed on account of his setbacks, often quarreling with the fortress Commandant Zacharias Wolf, and locked himself in his chamber. He wrote angry letters to the Privy Council and several defensive statements regarding his actions in the campaign. Afterwards, Stenbock reluctantly held an audience with Baron von Görtz, who said that the fortress only had supplies for three months, that the allied troops had started their advance towards the fortress walls, and suggested that Stenbock consider &quot;an honorable capitulation&quot;. When Stenbock&#x27;s troops entered Tönning, the Danes considered the formerly neutral duchy to be a warring nation. Between 16 and 18 February Danish troops occupied the ducal parts of Schleswig, sent the duchy&#x27;s troops to Rendsburg as prisoners of war, and replaced the ducal officials with Danish counterparts, while Christian August fled to Hamburg.


Baron von Görtz&#x27;s goal was to re-establish Holstein-Gottorp as a sovereign principality, and through Flemming he received an audience with Frederick IV. Görtz succeeded in convincing the King that Christian August was unaware of the events surrounding Tönning. After several meetings with Flemming, Vibe and other dignitaries, Görtz received a letter promising that Holstein-Gottorp would regain its fiefs and rights if Görtz convinced the Swedes to surrender. Görtz returned to Tönning on 16 April. At that time, 2,000 Swedish soldiers had died inside the fortress, diseases spread, and discipline was impossible to maintain, resulting in the desertion of several soldiers. The fortress was surrounded by 30,000 allied troops, who dug trenches outside the walls and brought forth heavy siege artillery. Stenbock convened with his subordinate officers regarding a probable surrender, and the officers agreed to begin negotiations, with Görtz acting as an intermediary. A Swedish delegation was sent to Simonsberg to negotiate with the Danish representatives, and on 21 April a Danish ultimatum was presented to the Swedish army. The ultimatum, bearing Frederick IV&#x27;s signature, required the Swedes to surrender their firearms, colors and artillery. Stenbock rejected the proposal and sent back Görtz, who claimed that he could procure a better agreement. However, Frederick IV became tired of Görtz, and on 3 May Stenbock learned that the Danes canceled all negotiations. Shortly thereafter, a Danish colonel informed the Swedes that they had 24 hours to consider the King&#x27;s ultimatum. Otherwise, the siege artillery would begin their bombardment.

Stenbock received a passport and an invitation to Oldenswort for direct negotiations with Frederick IV and the allied commanders. He headed a delegation consisting of two major generals and four colonels. The negotiations, which were held in Prince Menshikov&#x27;s quarters, lasted for over a week. The final agreement still forced the Swedes to hand over their firearms, horses, artillery and colors, but they were permitted to keep their luggage and uniforms, as well as letters and documents. Transport of the troops back to Sweden would also be allowed in due course, after exchange of prisoners. Tönning would remain in the hands of the duchy, and Flemming and Menshikov assured that the siege would be lifted as soon as the Swedes exited the fortress. After a final council of war with his officers in Tönning, Stenbock was persuaded to accept the terms, and the surrender agreement was signed in Oldenwort on 16 May. Stenbock proclaimed his surrender in a letter to Charles XII. On 20 May, around 9,000 Swedish soldiers and 1,000 officers marched out of Tönning and were taken to Danish prison camps. Stenbock accompanied Frederick IV to Oldenswort as guest of honor at the King&#x27;s table.

==Captivity (1713–1717)==
===Letter correspondence===

During the captivity, General War Commissar Malmberg was responsible for prisoner exchange talks, while Stenbock paid 8,000 riksdaler out of his own pocket for the prisoners&#x27; needs. By Christmas of 1713, about half of the 10,000 Swedish prisoners had died of hunger and exhaustion, escaped, or entered Danish service. In his quarters in Flensburg, Stenbock devoted his time to his artistic interests, and wrote new defensive statements in which he blamed Vellingk, Görtz and the Privy Council in Stockholm for his surrender. Colonel Carl Cronstedt and major general Carl Gustaf Wulfrath were sent to Sweden to carry out fundraising and assemble means of transport, and at the same time, they visited Vapnö to give presents and letters from Stenbock to Eva and their children. In June, Wulfrath was able to transfer 100,000 riksdaler to Vellingk in Hamburg, and a smaller Swedish transport fleet was sent to Åbenrå. However, the sum of money was first reduced by a poor rate of exchange in Hamburg, then Vellingk used some of the money for Wismar&#x27;s rearmament, on the orders of the Privy Council. The remaining amount was not enough to free the prisoners, and on 18 August Vellingk was told that the Privy Council had given up hope of procuring the prisoners&#x27; release, and that Sweden&#x27;s remaining resources must be used for the defense of the kingdom&#x27;s borders.

On 20 November, Stenbock was brought with his servants to Copenhagen and moved into the Marsvin Estate, a palace located at Højbro Plads not far from Strøget. Four Danish grenadiers were posted outside the palace windows, and two Danish colonels were Stenbock&#x27;s personal wardens. In the company of the colonels, Stenbock was able to move freely in Copenhagen, and the Danes reviewed all his letters and books. Immediately after his arrival, Stenbock began to write yet another defensive statement, this time directed at Görtz and Frederick IV, and addressed to all &quot;revered brothers, loving and highly honored Swedish compatriots&quot;. Stenbock&#x27;s stay in Marsvin Estate attracted people from Copenhagen&#x27;s richer circles, who wanted to see and exchange words with him, including Frederick IV&#x27;s councillors Ditlev Vibe, Christian Christophersen Sehested, and Valentin von Eickstedt, as well as foreign envoys such as Prince Vasily Lukich Dolgorukov and Poussin, an envoy from France. The latter received direct orders from Versailles to assist the Swedish Crown&#x27;s interests in Copenhagen. Poussin&#x27;s benevolence and respect helped to make Stenbock&#x27;s captivity more bearable, and from Poussin, Stenbock received rumors and gossip from Frederick IV&#x27;s court. With this information, Stenbock sent letters with Poussin&#x27;s seal to the Privy Council and Princess Ulrika Eleonora.

Alongside Poussin, Stenbock made some contacts that helped him with confidential deliveries. One of these was Aron Goldzier, a merchant who supplied his home with groceries daily, and whom Stenbock used to send and receive letters unnoticed. Another contact was Johan Lyth, who owned a diner in the adjoining floor at Marsvin Estate and, through the cracks of the wall, conveyed secret mail between Lyth and Stenbock&#x27;s servants. Stenbock used various pseudonyms in his letters, such as Mattias Maas, Zacharias Hinder and Catharina Hinder, and several of them were compiled in ciphered form. He exchanged several letters with Eva, who, through her network of contacts, gave Stenbock information from the Privy Council, as well as small money exchanges and gifts.

===Planned escape===

After his arrival at Marsvin Estate, Stenbock received a letter from Malmberg, in which he inquired about the opportunities to escape from captivity. Initially, Stenbock rejected a plan of escape, since a failed attempt would seriously harm his reputation. But when the prospect of a release became unrealistic, and Stenbock&#x27;s surveillance tightened, he reluctantly changed his attitude. On 1 May 1714 Stenbock sent a letter to Charles XII discussing a potential escape. Shortly thereafter, he gave Malmberg approval to rent a ship to transfer him to Sweden during the summer of 1714. In Lübeck, on 5 July, Malmberg signed a formal contract with Prussian skipper Christian Rötke. The escape plan was that Rötke and his crew would sail to Copenhagen under Prussian flag to deposit a cargo of firewood from Stralsund. The skipper would then visit Stenbock, smuggle him out of his home, and put him ashore on the Scanian coast. However, Stenbock sent a letter to Malmberg on 13 July calling off the project, as he thought the plan was too risky and unclear. On 27 July, he informed Malmberg that Marsvin Estate was patrolled at night by over three guards, and that the guards strip-searched all who went in or out of the building. On the same day, he wrote a letter to the city commandant Hans Christoph von Schönfeldt, in which he complained about the harsh surveillance and that, as a man of honor, he was unaccustomed to seek escape. At the same time, he helped his secretary Andreas Peter Wiingren to burn the drafts of all his letters and notes from the past six months, and with Poussin&#x27;s help, he smuggled sensitive documents to Hamburg.

A few days later Stenbock received a reply from Schönfeldt, with a royal order to confine Stenbock into two interior rooms in Marsvin Estate and separate him from all but two of his servants. Schönfeldt appointed seven colonels to take turns guarding Stenbock, and the guard force was increased to ten posts. On 6 August Christian Rötke arrived in Copenhagen and explored the possibilities for Stenbock&#x27;s escape. A few days later, Rötke and his crew were arrested by Danish soldiers and imprisoned at Holmen. Frederick IV was aware of Stenbock&#x27;s escape plan thanks to his royal post spy, the postal inspector Christian Erlund. He had controlled Stenbock&#x27;s secret correspondence and had deciphered his encrypted correspondence with Malmberg. Later, Erlund learned how to plagiarize the different cursive methods in the letters to be able to manipulate the mail to and from Marsvin Estate. Erlund was then able to tip a Danish Vice Admiral posted at Prøvestenen about Rötke&#x27;s ship, trace Stenbock&#x27;s secret documents in Hamburg, and seize Stenbock&#x27;s field archive, which had been placed, along with secret documents, in a coffin at the Swedish agent Herman Fock&#x27;s hideout in Lübeck. The coffin was presented to Frederick IV and his councillors; it contained 45 folders of letters from, among others, Charles XII, King Stanisław, Christian August and the ministers of the Ducal Holstein, the Swedish Privy Council, and Vellingk. The biggest find for the Danes was Stenbock&#x27;s treaty with Christian August regarding the entry of the Swedish army into Tönning. As evidence, the secret agreement constituted a significant propaganda tool against Stenbock, Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp. Frederick IV presented the information to the emissaries from the Holy Roman Empire, England, The Netherlands, Prussia and Russia. When the commission of inquiry interrogated Stenbock&#x27;s servants, his secretary Wiingren and the kitchen scribe Johan Anton Bon revealed that they were responsible for the encryption and security of Stenbock&#x27;s letters.

===Imprisonment and defamation===

On 17 November 1714 Stenbock was transferred in a covered wagon to Citadellet Frederikshavn, also known as Kastellet, where Commandant Jacob Peter von Bonar received him and declared that he could no longer communicate with the outside world. Stenbock was accommodated with two chamber servants in Bonar&#x27;s house. The dwelling had a tiled stove and Stenbock received four to five daily meals with wine and bread from the Commandant&#x27;s kitchen. Upon arriving at Kastellet, Stenbock immediately begun a new petition to Frederick IV, wherein he accused Malmberg of producing the escape plan and denied that it was his intention to escape. On 20 November the petition was sent to the king at Christiansborg Palace. At the same time, Stenbock completed two secret letters addressed to Charles XII and Ulrika Eleonora, in which he blamed the Danes for their rudeness and espionage. When he tried to send the letters through one of his chamber servants, they were seized by a Danish guard, who handed the letters over to Bonar. Stenbock learned about this the same day, and quickly wrote an anxious letter to Bonar in which he appealed to the commandant not to report the matter further. Stenbock&#x27;s letter had no effect, and on 4 December Bonar was ordered to arrange a special prison for Stenbock.

Stenbock was moved into the residence of the fortress chaplain, which was converted into a high-status prison, with barred windows and exterior doors. The residence had stoves in each room for heating and Stenbock could furnish it as he pleased. However, the rooms were darkly lit, and the whole residence lacked floor insulation, tormenting Stenbock since moisture and odors came up from the basement. Frederick IV appointed a new commission against Stenbock and his servants and collaborators. The commission began to question Stenbock on 20 December 1714. The commissioners showcased his correspondence with Malmberg, revealing their escape plan. Three days later, his secret treaty with the ministers of Holstein was revealed, along with his field archive with all his secret documents. Stenbock was frightened by the Danes&#x27; discovery, since his reputation was at stake. On 25 January 1715 Stenbock was questioned for the second and last time by the commissioners. They explained that Stenbock&#x27;s documents were now the property of Frederick IV and that his servants had been released. Stenbock, on the other hand, was accused of committing espionage and defaming the Danish regent, thus being guilty of lese-majeste. Stenbock quickly wrote a detailed appeal to Frederick IV, confessing his correspondence and implored the King to not brand him as a spy.

It took over a year for Frederick IV to reply to Stenbock&#x27;s appeal. During 1715 the King entrusted historian Christoph Heinrich Amthor with compiling his public accusation against Stenbock, using examples from Stenbock&#x27;s own letters to describe his planned secret escape to Scania, his forbidden correspondence with the King&#x27;s enemies, and his mocking letters about the King, his councillors and the Danish nation as a whole. Stenbock&#x27;s appeals to Frederick IV were also used in the script, where Amthor made them appear false and opportunistic, and characterized Stenbock as not living up to his own criteria of being an honorable man. In the spring of 1716, Amthor&#x27;s script was presented to Stenbock. Several months earlier, Stenbock had begun to write a long defensive statement, explaining his failed campaign in Germany, that Vellingk forced him to burn Altona, that Görtz tricked him into surrendering Tönning, and that Frederick IV violated the surrender agreement and treated Stenbock and the Swedish prisoners of war as &quot;wicked criminals&quot;. Stenbock also lamented his own failures, especially the destruction of Altona, and his lack of time and love for his family. He wrote that he was ready to die and wished that God would give &quot;a quick, gentle and gracious end upon my current misery.&quot; He completed the script on his twenty-sixth wedding anniversary, 23 March 1716.

During Stenbock&#x27;s last years of life his health deteriorated steadily: he had permanent kidney and joint pains and, from 1716, a visual impairment. He was forced to dismiss two of his chamber servants who stole valuables from him, and eventually the food served to him by Commandant Bonar&#x27;s wife became so inedible that Stenbock could only eat bread and drink wine. In August 1716 Stenbock received an unexpected visit from Tsar Peter I, during which he complained about his harsh captivity and inedible food. Peter I passed these complaints to Frederick IV, and soon afterwards Bonar was dismissed and a new Commandant made sure that Stenbock received better meals. At some point in 1716, Stenbock received news that his daughter Ulrika Magdalena had died during her first labor, on 21 January 1716 at the age of 22. This loss severely damaged his will to live.

==Death and funeral==

Stenbock died on 23 February 1717 in his cell at Kastellet. The cause of death has not been determined with certainty, but it was probably due to his long illness and lifestyle-related fragility. His defense script, along with other belongings, were hidden in a double-bottomed coffin that was brought to Sweden, and it took several decades before his writings came to public knowledge. On Frederick IV&#x27;s orders, Stenbock&#x27;s effects were registered and sealed, and his residence was draped in black velvet. Stenbock lay in state for a few days until he was buried &quot;with all the conventional military honors&quot; in the Garrison Church in Copenhagen. His coffin was later transported from Helsingør to Helsingborg in November 1719 and then, after a solemn procession across the city, taken to Vapnö Castle Church. Stenbock laid there until the death of his wife on 11 May 1722, when they were interred side by side in the Oxenstierna family crypt in Uppsala Cathedral.

==Legacy==

Stenbock is one of the few figures in the history of Sweden to be described as a hero by Swedish historians and become a figure in Swedish folklore. Through his open letters, speeches and defense scripts, Stenbock was able to defend his reputation and spread the image of a bold and far-sighted military leader in 18th-century Europe. The mystique around Stenbock continued to spread throughout the emergence of romantic nationalism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. He was called &quot;the great Carolean&quot; by historians such as Erik Gustaf Geijer, Anders Fryxell, Claes Annerstedt, and Carl Grimberg. Among romantic nationalistic cultural personalities, Stenbock has been portrayed in Gustaf Cederström&#x27;s historical paintings and in Carl Snoilsky&#x27;s poems &quot;Stenbock&#x27;s courier&quot; and &quot;By the Lathe&quot;, as well as in the poem &quot;Stenbock&quot; by Oscar Patric Sturzen-Becker and in the play &quot;Magnus Stenbock&quot; by Arnold Munthe. The opinion of Stenbock has been less positive abroad. Polish historians called him a war criminal and in Schleswig-Holstein, he was associated with the burning of Altona. However, Danish historians such as Knud Fabricius, August Tuxen, and Palle Lauring have written more positively about Stenbock; Lauring wrote: &quot;at that time in Denmark, we had not a single man who possessed the skill, intelligence and human carat of Stenbock&quot;. The Swedish memory of Stenbock faded after the Second World War and the long period between 1932 and 1976 when the Swedish Social Democratic Party were in power.

Some of Stenbock&#x27;s writings were assembled in 1721 by Joachim Christoph Nemeitz in French called . Stenbock has been the subject of several biographies. The first was written by Samuel Loenbom on behalf of Stenbock&#x27;s son, Gustaf Leonard Stenbock, and was printed between 1757 and 1765 in four parts of 1,200 pages in total. Subsequent biographies and memoirs have been written by Anders Magnus Strinnholm in 1821, Emilie Risberg in 1866, Claes Annerstedt in 1906, Samuel Ebbe Bring in 1910, Sven Wikberg in 1931, Ingvar Eriksson in 2007, and Andreas Marklund in 2008.

An equestrian statue of Magnus Stenbock was unveiled on 3 December 1901 at Stortorget in Helsingborg, with large festivities gathering thousands of people. It was rumored that King Oscar II declined to attend the inauguration, claiming that only members of the royal family should be allowed to be depicted on equestrian statues. However, the king sent a telegram for the inauguration, which read: &quot;Although prevented from attending today&#x27;s memorable feast, I am pleased to say that henceforth, Stenbock&#x27;s memorial shall adorn Helsingborg&#x27;s town square, always reminding all descendants to serve and protect this beloved motherland just as he did. Oscar.&quot; It is one of very few non-royal equestrian statues in Sweden. The statue was created by sculptors John Börjeson and Carl Johan Nilsson in Otto Meyer&#x27;s foundry in Stockholm. Börjeson&#x27;s original proposal for the statue was that Stenbock would raise his hand against Denmark, but this was changed since the gesture was considered an unnecessary provocation. For traffic reasons, the statue was moved on 14 May 1959, about to the right close to Helsingborg&#x27;s city hall. The statue is highly debated among Helsingborg&#x27;s municipal politicians. By tradition the city&#x27;s newly graduated students walk seven laps around the statue every June.

Stenbock is honored in several other ways in Helsingborg. Among other things, a former school, a church and a mall have been named after him. Ferdinand Edvard Ring made a statue of Stenbock, which is in Höganäs. One of Skånetrafiken&#x27;s pågatågen (interurban trains) has been named &quot;Magnus Stenbock&quot;. Streets have been named after him in up to 30 cities in Sweden.

<doc id="761892" wikidata="Q1390604" url="?curid=761892" title="Alfred Noyes">
<text>Alfred Noyes CBE (16 September 188025 June 1958) was an English poet, short-story writer and playwright.

==Early years==
Noyes was born in Wolverhampton, England the son of Alfred and Amelia Adams Noyes. When he was four, the family moved to Aberystwyth, Wales, where his father taught Latin and Greek. The Welsh coast and mountains were an inspiration to Noyes.

== Early career ==
In 1898, he left Aberystwyth for Exeter College, Oxford, where he distinguished himself at rowing, but failed to get his degree because he was meeting his publisher to arrange publication of his first volume of poems, &quot;The Loom of Years&quot; (1902), on a crucial day of his finals in 1903. On publication, &quot;The Loom of Years&quot; was lauded by W. B. Yeats and George Meredith. Noyes&#x27; poetry also proved popular with the book-buying public, and for the first two decades of his career his books sold well. 

=== &quot;The Barrel-Organ&quot; and &quot;The Highwayman&quot; ===
Noyes published five more volumes of poetry from 1903 to 1913, among them &quot;The Flower of Old Japan&quot; (1903) and &quot;Poems&quot; (1904). &quot;Poems&quot; included &quot;The Barrel-Organ&quot;. &quot;The Highwayman&quot; was first published in the August 1906 issue of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and included the following year in &quot;Forty Singing Seamen and Other Poems&quot;. In a nationwide poll conducted by the BBC in 1995 to find Britain&#x27;s favourite poem, &quot;The Highwayman&quot; was voted the nation&#x27;s 15th favourite poem. This poem was also the inspiration for name of the American folk music revival group, The Highwaymen.

=== &quot;Drake&quot; ===
Another major work in this phase of his career was &quot;Drake&quot;, a 200-page epic in blank verse about the Elizabethan naval commander Sir Francis Drake, which was published in two volumes (1906 and 1908). The poem shows the clear influence of Romantic poets such as Tennyson and Wordsworth, both in style and subject. Both volumes of &quot;Drake&quot; were the subjects of articles in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. 
=== &quot;Sherwood&quot; ===
Noyes&#x27; only full-length play, &quot;Sherwood&quot;, was published in 1911; it was reissued in 1926, with alterations, as &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. One of his most popular poems, &quot;A Song of Sherwood&quot;, also dates from 1911. Eventually, one of the more popular ballads dating from this period, &quot;Bacchus and the Pirates&quot;, was set to music for two voices and piano by Michael Brough, and first performed at the Swaledale Festival in 2012.

== Views on Literature ==
Noyes stated that Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Samuel Johnson and Alfred, Lord Tennyson were the greatest writers in the English language. Noyes modelled his poetry after Tennyson&#x27;s, and published a critical study of Tennyson in 1932. Noyes also admired the work of William Morris; his study of that writer was published in 1908. It was praised by Andrew Lang and later by C. S. Lewis.

By contrast, Noyes disliked most works of literary modernism. Noyes disdained the poetry of T. S. Eliot, regarding it as abstruse and pretentious. Noyes expressed contempt for Arnold Bennett, H. L. Mencken and Marcel Proust in his book &quot;The Edge of the Abyss&quot;, describing their works as salacious, irreligious and harmful to society as a whole. Noyes also had a special hatred for the work of James Joyce, calling it &quot;filth&quot;. Noyes decried Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, claiming that the novel was obscure and gratuitously vulgar. In a 1922 article for the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;, Noyes called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;Literary Bolshevism&quot; and &quot;the foulest book that has ever found its way into print.&quot; When Lord Birkenhead died in 1930, Noyes, in collaboration with Lord Darling, obtained the withdrawal of a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; (at that time, banned in the UK) from the auction sale of Birkenhead&#x27;s effects.

==First marriage and America==
In 1907, Noyes married Garnett Daniels, youngest daughter of US Army Colonel Byron G. Daniels, a Civil War veteran who was for some years U.S. Consul at Hull. Noyes first visited America in February 1913, partly to lecture on world peace and disarmament and partly to satisfy his wife&#x27;s desire that he should gather fresh experiences in her homeland. His first lecture tour lasted six weeks, extending as far west as Chicago. It proved so successful that he decided to make a second trip to the US in October and to stay six months. In this trip, he visited the principal American universities, including Princeton, where the impression he made on the faculty and undergraduates was so favourable that in February 1914 he was asked to join the staff as a visiting professor, lecturing on modern English literature from February to June. He accepted, and for the next nine years he and his wife divided their year between England and the US. At Princeton, Noyes&#x27; students included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edmund Wilson and John Peale Bishop. He resigned his professorship in 1923, but continued to travel and lecture throughout the United States for the rest of his life. Noyes&#x27; work proved to be popular in the United States. His writings were praised by the American reviewers Thomas Bailey Aldrich and William Lyon Phelps, and his poems were reprinted in numerous US newspapers and magazines. His wife died in 1926 at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, where she and Noyes were staying with friends.

==War==

Noyes is often portrayed by hostile critics as a militarist and jingoist. Actually, he was a pacifist who hated war and lectured against it, but felt that, when threatened by an aggressive and unreasoning enemy, a nation could not but fight. On this principle, he opposed the Boer War, but supported the Allies in both the World Wars. In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called &quot;The Wine Press&quot;. One American reviewer wrote that Noyes was &quot;inspired by a fervent hatred of war and all that war means&quot;, and had used &quot;all the resources of his varied art&quot; to depict its &quot;ultimate horror&quot;. The poet and critic Helen Bullis found Noyes&#x27; &quot;anti-militarist&quot; poem &quot;remarkable&quot;, &quot;passionate and inspiring&quot;, but, in its &quot;unsparing realism&quot;, lacking in &quot;the large vision, which sees the ultimate truth rather than the immediate details&quot;. In her view, Noyes failed to address the &quot;vital questions&quot; raised, for example, by William James&#x27; observation that for modern man, &quot;War is the &quot;strong&quot; life; it is life &quot;&quot;&quot;, or by Shakespeare&#x27;s invocation in &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; of war as the &quot;great corrector&quot; that heals and cures &quot;sick&quot; times. Bullis, a Freudian (unlike Noyes, for whom psychoanalysis was a pseudo-science), thought war had deeper roots than Noyes acknowledged. She saw looming &quot;the great figures of the Fates back of the conflict, while Mr Noyes sees only the &#x27;five men in black tail-coats&#x27; whose cold statecraft is responsible for it&quot;. In 1915, Upton Sinclair included some striking passages from &quot;The Wine Press&quot; in his anthology of the literature of social protest, &quot;The Cry for Justice&quot;.

During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front. Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the Foreign Office, where he worked with John Buchan on propaganda. He also did his patriotic chore as a literary figure, writing morale-boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England&#x27;s military past and asserting the morality of her cause. These works are now forgotten, apart from two ghost stories, &quot;The &quot;Lusitania&quot; Waits&quot; and &quot;The Log of the &quot;Evening Star&quot;&quot;, which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny. &quot;The &quot;Lusitania&quot; Waits&quot; is a ghost revenge story based on the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; by a German submarine in 1915 – although the tale hinges on an erroneous claim that the submarine crew had been awarded the Goetz medal for sinking the ship.

He aided pacifist causes financially, by conrtibuting the whimsical poem &quot;A Spell for a Fairy&quot; to &quot;Princess Mary&#x27;s Gift Book&quot; (ca 1915). The illustrations for this, by C.H.Shepperson, formed the templates for the Cottingley Fairies, controversially accepted, for instance by Arthur Conan Doyle as genuine evidence for psychic phenomena.

During World War II, Noyes wrote the same kind of patriotic poems, but he also wrote a much longer and more considered work, &quot;If Judgement Comes&quot;, in which Hitler stands accused before the tribunal of history. It was first published separately (1941) and then in the collection, &quot;Shadows on the Down and Other Poems&quot; (1945). The only fiction Noyes published in World War II was &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1940), a science fiction novel whose message could hardly be more anti-war. In the first chapter, a global conflict wipes out almost the entire human race.

Noyes&#x27; best-known anti-war poem, &quot;The Victory Ball&quot; (aka &quot;A Victory Dance&quot;), was first published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1920. He wrote it after attending a ball held in London soon after the Armistice, where he found himself wondering what the ghosts of the soldiers who had died in the war would say if they could observe the thoughtless frivolity of the dancers. The message of the poem lies in the line, &quot;Under the dancing feet are the graves.&quot; A brief passage about a girl &quot;fresh from school&quot; who &quot;begs for a dose of the best cocaine&quot; was replaced by something innocuous in the &quot;Post&quot; version, but reinstated when the poem appeared in a collection of Noyes&#x27; verse. &quot;The Victory Ball&quot; was turned into a symphonic poem by Ernest Schelling and into a ballet by Benjamin Zemach. In 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, Congressman H. R. Gross, indignant at a White House dinner dance that went on until 3 a.m. while American soldiers were giving their lives, inserted Noyes&#x27; poem in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; as bearing &quot;directly on the subject matter in hand&quot;.

==Middle years==
In 1918, Noyes&#x27; short story collection, &quot;Walking Shadows: Sea Tales and Others&quot;, came out. It included both &quot;The &quot;Lusitania&quot; Waits&quot; and &quot;The Log of the &quot;Evening Star&quot;&quot;. In 1924 Noyes published another collection, &quot;The Hidden Player&quot;, which included a novella, &quot;Beyond the Desert: A Tale of Death Valley&quot;, already published separately in America in 1920.

For the Pageant of Empire at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, Noyes wrote a series of poems set to music by Sir Edward Elgar and known as &quot;Pageant of Empire&quot;. Among these poems was &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;.

In 1929, Noyes published the first of his three novels, &quot;The Return of the Scare-Crow&quot; (US title: &quot;The Sun Cure&quot;). A light-hearted story combining adventure, satire and comedy, it is about an earnest young clergyman named Basil. During a walk on the South Downs, Basil comes across a ruined cottage, where he decides to try sunbathing naked, as recommended by a friend. His clothes vanish, and he has to battle his way back to them through a series of mental hazards – all the latest intellectual fads and follies – and ends up rather less naïve than before.

==Second marriage and Catholicism==
In 1927, the year after his first wife&#x27;s death, Noyes married Mary Angela &quot;née&quot; Mayne (1889–1976), widow of Lieutenant Richard Shireburn Weld-Blundell, a member of the old recusant Catholic Weld-Blundell family, who had been killed in World War I. Later that year, Noyes himself converted to Catholicism. He gives an account of his conversion in his autobiography, &quot;Two Worlds for Memory&quot; (1953), but sets forth the more intellectual steps by which he was led from agnosticism to the Catholic faith in &quot;The Unknown God&quot; (1934), a widely read work of Christian apologetics which has been described as &quot;the spiritual biography of a generation&quot;. In 1929, Noyes and Mary Angela settled at Lisle Combe, on the Undercliff near Ventnor, Isle of Wight. They had three children: Hugh (1929–2000), Veronica and Margaret. Noyes&#x27; younger daughter married Michael Nolan (later Lord Nolan) in 1953.

==&quot;The Torch-Bearers&quot;==
Noyes&#x27; ambitious epic verse trilogy &quot;The Torch-Bearers&quot; – comprising &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot; (1922), &quot;The Book of Earth&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1930) – deals with the history of science. In the &quot;Prefatory Note&quot; to &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;, Noyes expresses his purpose in writing the trilogy:
===&quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;===
Noyes adds that the theme of the trilogy had long been in his mind, but the first volume, dealing with &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;, began to take definite shape only on the night of 1/2 November 1917, when the 100-inch reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory was first tested by starlight. George Ellery Hale, the man who conceived and founded the observatory, had invited Noyes, who was then in California, to be his guest on this momentous occasion, and the prologue, subtitled &quot;The Observatory&quot;, gives Noyes&#x27; detailed description of that &quot;unforgettable...night&quot;. In his review of &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;, the scholar and historian of science Frederick E. Brasch writes that Noyes&#x27; &quot;journey up to the mountain&#x27;s top, the observatory, the monastery, telescopes and mirrors, clockwork, switchboard, the lighted city below, planets and stars, atoms and electrons all are woven into...beautiful narrative poetry. It seems almost incredible that technical terms and concepts could lend themselves for that purpose.&quot;

After the prologue come seven long poems, each of which depicts salient episodes in the career of a major scientist, so as to bring out both the &quot;intensely human drama&quot; (&quot;Prefatory Note&quot;) of his life and his contribution to astronomy. Noyes&#x27; seven scientists are Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and William and John Herschel – though due mention is also made of the contribution of Caroline Herschel, sister to William and aunt to John. In the epilogue, Noyes meditates once more upon the mountain in the morning, before bringing his narrative to a close in the form of a prayer.

In his review, Frederick E. Brasch writes that Noyes&#x27; &quot;knowledge of the science of astronomy and its history...seems remarkable in one who is so entirely unrelated to the work of an observatory&quot;. &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot;, he adds, will no doubt appeal to the layman &quot;for its beauty and the music of its narrative verse, broken and interspersed with epic poetry. But it remains for the astronomer and other scholars in science to enjoy it to the fullness which is adequate to Noyes&#x27; ability as a poet.&quot;

===&quot;The Book of Earth&quot;===
&quot;The Book of Earth&quot; is the second volume in the trilogy. In eight sections framed by a meditative prologue and epilogue, it follows the discoveries of scientists in their struggles to solve the mysteries of the earth, of life forms, and of human origins. Starting in ancient Greece with Pythagoras and Aristotle, it then moves to the Middle East for Al-Farabi and Avicenna. The scene then shifts successively to Italy for Leonardo da Vinci, France for Jean-Étienne Guettard, Sweden for Carl Linnaeus, France again for Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Jean Baptiste Lamarck, Antoine Lavoisier, and Georges Cuvier, and then Germany for Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, before ending in England with Charles Darwin. Reviewing &quot;The Book of Earth&quot; for &quot;Nature&quot;, F. S. Marvin wrote, &quot;It deals with a much more difficult subject from the point of view of poetic presentation, namely biology, or rather geology as a preface to zoology and evolution as crowning geology.&quot; Nevertheless, it does not &quot;belie the...expectations&quot; raised by its predecessor. By contrast, Edgell Rickword in the September 1925 issue of &quot;The Calendar of Modern Letters&quot; gave a negative review of &quot;The Book of Earth&quot;. Rickword stated: &quot;If ‘science’ had really meant anything, poetically, to Mr. Noyes, it would have altered his universe; would have created metaphors. As it is, he sails his pretentious kite with rags of literature and superstition in its tail.&quot; Rickword&#x27;s article on Noyes was reprinted in the book &quot;Towards Standards of Criticism&quot; by the literary critic F. R. Leavis in 1933. In his introduction to that book, Leavis described Noyes&#x27; poetry as &quot;intrinsically uninteresting work&quot;. Because of Rickword and Leavis&#x27; prominence as literary critics, Noyes&#x27; literary reputation began to decline in the 1920s.

===&quot;The Last Voyage&quot;===
Before Noyes had begun proper work on the final volume in the trilogy, &quot;The Last Voyage&quot;, two events occurred which were to influence it greatly: his first wife&#x27;s death and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. Death is a major theme in &quot;The Last Voyage&quot;, as its very title suggests. The tone, more sombre than that of its predecessors, is also more religious – though religion was hardly absent from the earlier volumes – and, as might be expected, more specifically Catholic.

&quot;The Last Voyage&quot; begins at night in mid-Atlantic, where an ocean liner, &quot;a great ship like a lighted city&quot;, is battling through a raging storm. A little girl is mortally ill. The ship&#x27;s surgeon prepares to operate, but with little hope of success, for the case is complicated and he is no specialist. Luckily, the captain knows from the wireless news that a top specialist from Johns Hopkins Hospital is on another liner 400 miles away – within wireless range. The ship&#x27;s surgeon will be able to consult him, and stay in touch with him throughout the operation. Suddenly, the little girl&#x27;s chances of survival are much improved. In a manner of speaking, all the scientific discoveries and inventions of the past are being brought to bear in the attempt to save her life. When the poet asks a casually-met fellow-passenger, &quot;You think they&#x27;ll save her?&quot; the stranger replies, &quot;&quot;They&quot; may save her&quot;, and then adds enigmatically, &quot;But who are &quot;They&quot;?&quot;

Reflecting, the poet realises that &quot;They&quot; are all the seekers and discoverers of scientific truths through the ages – people like William Harvey, Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister in the field of medicine or Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell and Heinrich Hertz in the development of the wireless. Nevertheless, despite the united efforts of all, the little girl dies, and in the darkness of that loss the poet finds that only in Faith can a flicker of light be found. Science cannot defeat death in the long run, and sometimes, as in the little girl&#x27;s case, not even in the short run, but if &quot;Love, not Death&quot; is the ultimate reality, death will not have the final word. Of course, the &quot;last voyage&quot; of the title is not just that of the little girl or of Noyes&#x27; wife – though there are lyrics mourning her in Section XIII and another in the Dedication at the end – but of everyman and everywoman.

F. S. Marvin, who reviewed all three volumes of &quot;The Torch-Bearers&quot; for &quot;Nature&quot;, wrote that &quot;the third volume is certainly the best from the artistic point of view. It contains one well-conceived and highly interesting incident, around which the author&#x27;s pictures of the past and incidental lyrics are effectively grouped, and it leads up to a full and eloquent exposition of the religious synthesis with which the history of science inspires him.&quot;

==&quot;The Last Man&quot;==
In 1940 Noyes published a science fiction novel, &quot;The Last Man&quot; (US title: &quot;No Other Man&quot;), in which the human race is almost wiped out by a powerful death ray capable of killing everyone, friend or foe, unless they are in a steel chamber deep under the surface of the sea. The inventor&#x27;s chief assistant unscrupulously sells the plans to the leading nations of the world, who declare they will use the ray only as a &quot;last resort&quot;. When events spiral out of control, however, they all activate it, killing everyone living on the earth.

When the death ray strikes, a 29-year-old Englishman named Mark Adams is trapped in a sunken submarine. Managing to escape, he finds himself the only survivor in Britain. He travels to Paris in the hope of finding another survivor. There he discovers a clue which gives him hope. His search leads him to Italy, where he finally finds the other survivor, an American girl named Evelyn Hamilton. At the time when the death ray struck, she was in a diving bell deep below the surface of the Mediterranean, where, under the guidance of Mardok, an immensely wealthy magnate and scientific genius, she was engaged in photographing the floor of the sea. Her companion turns out to be the villain of the story. Knowing the power of the ray, for whose development he had been largely responsible, he had made sure that, at the time of its activation, he was safely out of its reach, along with an attractive young woman with whom he could later begin the repopulation of the planet. Evelyn, however, finds him repulsive, and the arrival of the upstanding, handsome young Englishman further upsets Mardok&#x27;s plan. In the ensuing competition between the two men for the girl, Mark Adams&#x27; surname is a clear hint at which of the two is better fitted to be Adam to Evelyn&#x27;s Eve. The two young people fall in love, but Mardok kidnaps Evelyn. After her escape and Mardok&#x27;s death, the novel concludes with the young couple&#x27;s discovery of some other survivors at Assisi.

For Charles Holland, reviewing the novel in the 1940s, Noyes&#x27; combination of &quot;such elements of human interest as apologetics, art, travel and a captivating love story&quot; mean that the reader of &quot;The Last Man&quot; is assured of both &quot;an intellectual treat and real entertainment&quot;. Eric Atlas, writing in an early science fiction fanzine, found the novel, despite some flaws, &quot;well worth the reading – perhaps twice&quot;. The philosophico-religious theme, he wrote, &quot;detracts in no way from the forceful characterizations...of Mark and Evelyn&quot;. Besides, most of the novel is set &quot;in Italy, where Noyes&#x27; descriptive powers as a poet come to the fore&quot;. &quot;The Last Man&quot; seems to be the novel which introduced the idea of a doomsday weapon. It is thought to have been among the influences on George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1940, Noyes returned to North America, where he lectured and advocated the British war position. The following year, he gave the Josiah Wood lectures at Mount Allison University, New Brunswick, Canada. Titled &quot;The Edge of the Abyss&quot;, they were first published in Canada in 1942 and then, in a revised version, in the United States the same year and in Britain two years later. In &quot;The Edge of the Abyss&quot;, Noyes ponders the future of the world, attacking totalitarianism, bureaucracy, the pervasive power of the state, and the collapse of moral standards. George Orwell reviewed the book for &quot;The Observer&quot; and, like &quot;The Last Man&quot;, it is considered a probable influence on &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

In his review, Orwell wrote that &quot;The Edge of the Abyss&quot; &quot;raises a real problem,&quot; paraphrasing Noyes&#x27; premise as a question of &quot;decay in the belief in absolute good and evil,&quot; with the result that the &quot;rules of behaviour on which any stable society has to rest are dissolving&quot; and &quot;even the prudential reasons for common decency are being forgotten.&quot; Indeed, in Orwell&#x27;s view, Noyes &quot;probably even underemphasises the harm done to ordinary common sense by the cult of &#x27;realism&#x27;, with its inherent tendency to assume that the dishonest course is always the profitable one.&quot; Orwell, however, finds Noyes&#x27; suggested remedy, a return to Christianity, &quot;doubtful, even from the point of view of practicality.&quot; He agrees that the &quot;problem of our time is to restore the sense of absolute right and wrong&quot; but this is at a time when its foundation, a belief in personal immortality, has been &quot;destroyed.&quot; While Orwell names &quot;faith&quot; as what would be needed in this restoration, he also notes that focusing on Christian faith as Noyes does would exclude wide swaths of Asia and imply a &quot;good life&quot; could only be lived on the &quot;fringes of the Atlantic.&quot; Orwell concludes Noyes &quot;is probably wrong in imagining that the Christian faith, as it existed in the past, can be restored even in Europe.&quot; Orwell does not expound further on what his broader concept of &quot;faith&quot; entails.

An anonymous review of &quot;The Edge of the Abyss&quot; in the American magazine &quot;Free World&quot; was more critical. The review focuses on Noyes&#x27; claim that literary Modernism is a symptom of the problems of the world, and concluded: &quot;The point is debatable, the argument high-pitched and inconclusive, and the remedies proposed vague and unsatisfactory.&quot;

Noyes remained in retirement in California for some years. In 1943, he published &quot;The Secret of Pooduck Island&quot;, a children&#x27;s story set off the coast of Maine. It features a family of squirrels threatened by natural enemies (skunks, weasels) and humans, the ghost of a Native American man who suffered a terrible sorrow in the colonial era, and a teenage boy who has ambitions to be an artist and who is able to help both the squirrels and the ghost. It is, however, far more profound and terrible than the lighthearted accounts of animal behaviour seem on the surface to indicate; a mysterious voice keeps whispering words of mystery to the artist Solo, and most of the characters turn out to be incarnations of the various follies and stupidities of mankind: the fierce lonely boy-artist (who is nearly locked up as insane by the petty spiteful villagers) and the pudgy but wise priest, as well as the solemn ghost of Squando, being the only exceptions against which the others are contrasted. The entire &quot;secret&quot; of Pooduck Island consists in the gleams of the supernatural that blaze through the canopy of the material world, like a glimpse of the ocean through an arch in the woods that Solo names the &quot;Eye&quot; of the island. The mysterious Voice, who is hinted to be Glooskap himself, appears indirectly as an invisible model for a portrait of the Squirrel family, who think they are seated on a stump: but the picture records him.

In 1949, Noyes returned to his home on the Isle of Wight. As a result of increasing blindness, he dictated all his subsequent works. In 1952 he brought out another book for children, &quot;Daddy Fell into the Pond and Other Poems&quot;. The title poem has remained a firm favourite with children ever since. In 2005, it was one of the few poems that featured in both of two major anthologies of poetry for children published that year, one edited by Caroline Kennedy, the other by Elise Paschen.

In 1955, Noyes published the satirical fantasy novel &quot;The Devil Takes A Holiday&quot;, in which the Devil, in the guise of Mr Lucius Balliol, an international financier, comes to Santa Barbara, California, for a pleasant little holiday. He finds however, that his work is being so efficiently performed by humankind that he has become redundant. The unwonted soul-searching this leads him to is not only painful but also – owing to a tragicomic twist at the end – ultimately futile. Brian Stableford has described &quot;The Devil Takes A Holiday&quot; as &quot;comic affair&quot; and &quot;an interesting example of English &quot;Literary Satanism.&quot;&quot;

Noyes&#x27; last book of poetry, &quot;A Letter to Lucian and Other Poems&quot;, came out in 1956, two years before his death by polio.

==&quot;The Accusing Ghost&quot;==
In 1957, Noyes published his last book, &quot;The Accusing Ghost, or Justice for Casement&quot; (US title: &quot;The Accusing Ghost of Roger Casement&quot;). In 1916, the renowned human rights campaigner Roger Casement was hanged for his involvement in the Irish Nationalist revolt in Dublin known as the Easter Rising. To forestall calls for clemency, the British authorities showed public figures and known sympathizers selected pages from some of Casement&#x27;s diaries – known as the &quot;Black Diaries&quot; – that exposed him as a promiscuous homosexual. As a consequence the expected protests and petitions for Casement&#x27;s reprieve failed to materialise.

Among those who read these extracts was Noyes, who was then working in the News Department of the Foreign Office and who described the pages as a &quot;foul record&quot; of &quot;the lowest depths that human degradation has ever touched&quot;. Later that year in Philadelphia, when Noyes was about to give a lecture on the English poets, he was confronted by Casement&#x27;s sister, Nina, who denounced him as a &quot;blackguardly scoundrel&quot; and cried, &quot;Your countrymen hanged my brother Roger Casement.&quot;

Worse was to come. After Casement&#x27;s death, the British authorities held the diaries in conditions of extraordinary secrecy, arousing strong suspicions among Casement&#x27;s supporters that they were forged. In 1936, there appeared a book by an American doctor, William J. Maloney, called &quot;The Forged Casement Diaries&quot;. After reading it, W. B. Yeats wrote a protest poem, &quot;Roger Casement&quot;, which was published with great prominence in &quot;The Irish Press&quot;. In the fifth stanza of the poem, Yeats named Alfred Noyes and called on him to desert the side of the forger and perjurer. Noyes immediately responded with a letter to &quot;The Irish Press&quot; in which he explained why he had assumed the diaries were authentic, confessed he might have been misled, and called for the setting up of a committee to examine the original documents and settle the matter. In response to what he called Noyes&#x27; &quot;noble&quot; letter, Yeats amended his poem, removing Noyes&#x27; name.

Over twenty years later, Casement&#x27;s diaries were still being held in the same conditions of secrecy. In 1957, therefore, Noyes published &quot;The Accusing Ghost, or Justice for Casement&quot;, a stinging rebuke of British policy in which, making full amends for his previous harsh judgement, he argued that Casement had indeed been the victim of a British Intelligence plot.

In 2002, a forensic examination of the &quot;Black Diaries&quot; concluded that they were authentic.

==Death==

Noyes&#x27; last poem, &quot;Ballade of the Breaking Shell&quot;, was written in May 1958, one month before his death. He died at the age of 77, and is buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery at Totland, Isle of Wight.

<text>The Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (abbreviated as EPS or simply Encyclopaedia; , EPW, translated as Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Basic Outline) by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (first published in 1817, second edition 1827, third edition 1830), is a work that presents an abbreviated version of Hegel&#x27;s systematic philosophy in its entirety, and is the only form in which Hegel ever published his entire mature philosophical system. The fact that the account is exhaustive, that the grounding structures of reality are ideal, and that the system is closed makes the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; a statement par excellence of absolute idealism.

Intended as a pedagogical aid for attendees of his lectures, Hegel revised and extended the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; over more than a decade, but stressed its role as a &quot;textbook&quot; in need of elucidation through oral commentary. The 1830 text is widely available in various English translations with copious additions (&quot;Zusätze&quot;) added posthumously by Hegel&#x27;s students, deriving from their lecture notes. These additions expand on the text with examples and illustrations, and while scholars do not take the &quot;Zusätze&quot; to be verbatim transcription of Hegel&#x27;s lectures, their more informal and non-technical style make them good stand-ins for the &quot;necessary oral commentary&quot;.

Part I of the work is sometimes referred to as the Lesser Logic (or Shorter Logic) to distinguish it from the &quot;Greater Logic&quot;, the moniker given to Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Science of Logic&quot;.

== Structure ==
The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; has three main parts, each of which is further subdivided, which together purport to cover all the fundamental aspects of reality, and form a closed systematic unity.
# Science of Logic 
## Being
## Essence
## Concept (&quot;Begriff,&quot; or notion)
# Science of Nature
## Mechanics
## Physics
## Organics
# Science of Geist
## Subjective
## Objective
## Absolute Spirit
Hegel is careful to methodically derive each category of reality (&#x27;thought-determination&#x27;) from its predecessor notion, with the completed system bringing the circle to a close, demonstrating its unity.

==Overview==
The work describes the pattern of the Idea as manifesting itself in dialectical reasoning.

While some believe that the philosophy of nature and mind are applications of the logic, this is a misunderstanding. The purpose of the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; is descriptive: to describe how the idea (or reason) develops itself and not to apply the dialectical method to all areas of human knowledge, but the Idea is in process of growing, like a seed growing into a mature tree: it passes through stages. The first stage of the idea&#x27;s development is described in the Logic. Thus the Logic presents the categories of thought as they are in themselves; they are the minimal conditions for thinking anything at all, the conceptions that run in the background of all our thinking. For Hegel, unlike Kant, reason is not just &quot;for us&quot;, but rather it is immanent within being. The rational alone is real, and is the substrate of all things. In order to get at what a thing &quot;is&quot;, we must think about it. No amount of observing will bring us to the essence of things. Thinking and being are equivalent, and so logic and metaphysics are equivalent as well. 

As the idea works itself out more fully, it reaches the point where it simply cannot remain as it is; it is incomplete, and therefore it &quot;others&quot; itself; this is where the philosophy of nature emerges. When this stage of its development is completed, the idea &quot;returns&quot; to itself, which is the emergence of the philosophy of mind, or Geist, out of nature. Spirit is reason become self-conscious of itself as reason. 

Hegel used the term &quot;diamond net&quot; in the book. He said, “the entire range of the universal determinations of thought… into which everything is brought and thereby first made intelligible.” In other words, the diamond net of which Hegel speaks are the logical categories according to which we understand our experience, thus making our empirical observations intelligible.

==English translations==
English translations of all three parts are available from Oxford University Press (Part One: &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Logic&quot;, 1975; Part Two: &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Nature&quot;, 2004; Part Three: &quot;Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Mind&quot;, 1970), with each part bound as a separate book.

An English translation of the first part is also available from Cambridge University Press: &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Basic Outline, Part I: Science of Logic&quot;, translated by Klaus Brinkmann, Daniel O. Dahlstrom (Cambridge University Press, 2010).

<doc id="761899" wikidata="Q1314426" url="?curid=761899" title="Sayings of Jesus on the cross">
<text>The sayings of Jesus on the cross (sometimes called the Seven Last Words from the Cross) are seven expressions biblically attributed to Jesus during his crucifixion. Traditionally, the brief sayings have been called &quot;words&quot;.

The seven sayings are gathered from the four canonical gospels. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus cries out to God. In Luke, he forgives his killers, reassures the penitent thief, and commends his spirit to the Father. In John, he speaks to his mother, says he thirsts, and declares the end of his earthly life. This is an example of the Christian approach to the construction of a gospel harmony, in which material from different gospels is combined, producing an account that goes beyond each gospel.

Since the 16th century, these sayings have been widely used in sermons on Good Friday, and entire books have been written on theological analysis of them. The Seven Last Words from the Cross are an integral part of the liturgy in the Catholic, Protestant, and other Christian traditions. Several composers have set the sayings to music.

== Overview ==
In the following table, the seven sayings are arranged according to their traditional order. However, all seven sayings cannot be found in any one account of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. The ordering is a harmonisation of the texts from each of the four canonical gospels. Three of the sayings appear only in Luke and three only in John. One other saying appears both in Matthew and Mark, and another (&quot;It is finished&quot;) is only directly quoted in John but alluded to in Matthew and Mark.

The sayings form part of the Stations of the Cross, a Christian meditation that is often used during Lent, Holy Week and Good Friday.

The Dominican author Timothy Radcliffe sees the number seven as significant, as the number of perfection in the Bible. He writes that as God created the world in seven days, &quot;these seven words belong to God&#x27;s completion of that creation&quot;.

===Historicity===
James Dunn considers the seven sayings weakly rooted in tradition and sees them as a part of the elaborations in the diverse retellings of Jesus&#x27; final hours. He does, however, argue in favour of the authenticity of the Mark/Matthew saying, in which Jesus seems to describe himself as forsaken by God. This would have been an embarrassment to the early Church, and hence would likely not have been invented. Leslie Houlden suggests that Luke may have deliberately excluded this saying from his gospel because it did not fit in with the model of Jesus he was presenting.

Michael Licona suggests that John has redacted Jesus&#x27; authentic statements as recorded in Matthew, Mark and Luke. Where Matthew and Mark have Jesus quote Psalm 22:1, John records that &quot;in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled, Jesus said, &#x27;I am thirsty&#x27;.&quot; Jesus&#x27; final words as recorded in Luke are simplified in John into &quot;It is finished.&quot;

==The seven sayings==
=== 1. Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do ===
This first saying of Jesus on the cross is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Forgiveness&quot;. It is theologically interpreted as Jesus&#x27; prayer for forgiveness for the Roman soldiers who were crucifying him and all others who were involved in his crucifixion.

Some early manuscripts do not include this sentence in Luke 23:34. Biblical scholars such as Bart Ehrman have argued that it was omitted by some scribes because of anti-Judaic sentiment around the second century.

=== 2. shalt thou be with me in paradise ===

This saying is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Salvation&quot;. According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was crucified between two thieves (traditionally named Dismas and Gestas), one of whom supports Jesus&#x27; innocence and asks him to remember him when he comes into his kingdom. Jesus replies, &quot;Verily I say unto thee...&quot; (), followed with the only appearance of the word &quot;Paradise&quot; in the gospels (, originally from Persian , &quot;paradise garden&quot;).

A seemingly simple change in punctuation in this saying has been the subject of doctrinal differences among Christian groups, given the lack of punctuation in the original Greek texts. Catholics and most Protestant Christians usually use a version which reads &quot;today you will be with me in Paradise&quot;. This reading assumes a direct voyage to Heaven and has no implications of purgatory. On the other hand, some Protestants who believe in soul sleep have used a reading which emphasizes &quot;I say to you today&quot;, leaving open the possibility that the statement was made today, but arrival in Heaven may be later.

=== 3. Woman, behold, thy son! Behold, thy mother! ===
 

This statement is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Relationship&quot; and in it Jesus entrusts Mary, his mother, into the care of &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;.

Jesus also addresses his mother as &quot;woman&quot; in John 2:4. Although this sounds dismissive in English, the Greek word is a term of respect or tenderness. Catholic commentators, on the basis of these two passages, often connect Mary with the &quot;woman&quot; of Genesis 3:15, and the &quot;woman clothed with the sun&quot; in Revelation 12, and therefore see this title of &quot;woman&quot; as a justification for the veneration of Mary as a second Eve.

===4. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?===


This is the only saying which appears in more than one gospel. In both accounts, the words spoken by Jesus have been transliterated from Aramaic into Greek, and there are slight differences between the two versions (Mark: ; Matthew: ). In both cases, σαβαχθανί seems to be the Greek transliteration of Aramaic שבקתני &quot;šəḇaqtanī,&quot; meaning &quot;forsaken me&quot;. 

Both versions can be said to be in Aramaic rather than in closely related Hebrew because of the verb (&quot;šbq&quot;) &quot;abandon&quot;, which exists only in Aramaic. The Hebrew counterpart to this word, (&quot;zb&quot;), is seen in the second line of the Old Testament&#x27;s Psalm 22, which the saying appears to quote. Thus, Jesus is not quoting the canonical Hebrew version (&quot;ēlī ēlī lāmā &#x27;azabtānī&quot;), attributed in some Jewish interpretations to King David himself, but rather the version in an Aramaic Targum (translation of the Bible). Surviving Aramaic Targums do use the verb &quot;šbq&quot; in their translations of the Psalm 22.

In the next verse, in both accounts, some who hear Jesus&#x27; cry imagine that he is calling for help from Elijah (&quot;Ēlīyā&quot; in Aramaic).

The Aramaic word form שבקתני &quot;šəḇaqtanī&quot; is based on the verb &quot;šǝḇaq&quot;/&quot;šāḇaq&quot;, &#x27;to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake&#x27;, with the perfect tense ending &quot;-t&quot; (2nd person singular: &#x27;you&#x27;), and the object suffix &quot;-anī&quot; (1st person singular: &#x27;me&#x27;).

In Hebrew, the saying would be &quot;&quot; (&quot;ēlī ēlī, lāmā &#x27;azabtānī&quot; in Biblical Hebrew, &quot;eli eli lama azavtani&quot; in Modern Hebrew pronunciation), while the Syriac-Aramaic phrase according to the Peshitta would be (Matthew 27:46) or (Mark 15:34).

This saying is taken by some as an abandonment of the Son by the Father. Another interpretation holds that at the moment when Jesus took upon himself the sins of humanity, the Father had to turn away from the Son because the Father is &quot;of purer eyes than to see evil and cannot look at wrong&quot; (ESV). Other theologians understand the cry as that of one who was truly human and who felt forsaken. Put to death by his foes, very largely deserted by his friends, he may have also felt deserted by God.

Others see these words in the context of Psalm 22 and suggest that Jesus recited these words, perhaps even the whole psalm, &quot;that he might show himself to be the very Being to whom the words refer; so that the Jewish scribes and people might examine and see the cause why he would not descend from the cross; namely, because this very psalm showed that it was appointed that he should suffer these things.&quot;

===5. I thirst===
This statement is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Distress&quot; and is compared and contrasted with the encounter of Jesus with the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4.

Only John records this saying, but all four gospels relate that Jesus was offered a drink of sour wine (possibly posca). In Mark and Matthew, a sponge was soaked in the wine and lifted up to Jesus on a reed; John says the same, but states that the sponge was affixed to a hyssop branch. This may have been intended as symbolically significant, as hyssop branches are often mentioned in the Old Testament in the context of the use of sacrificial blood for ritual purification.

This statement of Jesus is interpreted by John as fulfilment of the prophecy given in Psalm 69:21, &quot;in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink&quot;; hence the quotation from John&#x27;s gospel includes the comment &quot;that the scripture might be fulfilled&quot;. The Jerusalem Bible cross-references Psalm 22:15: &quot;my palate is drier than a potsherd, and my tongue is stuck to my jaw&quot;.

===6. It is finished===

This statement is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Triumph&quot; and is theologically interpreted as the announcement of the end of the earthly life of Jesus, in anticipation for the Resurrection.

The Greek word translated &quot;It is finished&quot; is (). The verse has also been translated as &quot;It is consummated.&quot; 

The utterance after consuming the beverage and immediately before death is mentioned, but not explicitly quoted, in Mark 15:37 and Matthew 27:50 (both of which state that Jesus &quot;cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost&quot;).

=== 7. Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit ===

From Psalm 31:5, this saying, which is an announcement and not a request, is traditionally called &quot;The Word of Reunion&quot; and is theologically interpreted as the proclamation of Jesus joining God the Father in Heaven.

The words of Luke 23:46, or the fuller Psalm 31:5, have subsequently been attributed as last words of famous people, especially those considered pious Christians, such as martyrs or saints. These include 
Philip the Apostle (died AD 80), Basil the Great (AD 379), Charlemagne (died 814), Ansgar (865), Thomas Becket (1170), Jan Hus (1415), Christopher Columbus (1506), Ludovica Albertoni (1533), Martin Luther (1546), George Wishart (1546), Lady Jane Grey (1554), her father Henry, Duke of Suffolk (1555), Thomas of Villanova (1555), Mary, Queen of Scots (1587), Aloysius Gonzaga (1591), Torquato Tasso (1595), Turibius of Mogrovejo (1606), John Bruen (1625), George Herbert (1633), Covenanters including Hugh Mackail (1666) and James Renwick (1688), and Christian Friedrich Schwarz (1798).

<doc id="761902" wikidata="Q222890" url="?curid=761902" title="Novatian">
<text>Novatian (Greek: Νοβατιανός, Latin: Novatianus, ) was a scholar, priest, and theologian. He is considered by the Catholic Church to have been an antipope between 251 and 258. Some Greek authors give his name as Novatus, who was an African presbyter.

He was a noted theologian and writer, the first Roman theologian who used the Latin language, at a time when there was much debate about how to deal with Christians who had lapsed and wished to return, and the issue of penance. Consecrated as pope by three bishops in 251, he adopted a more rigorous position than the established Pope Cornelius. Novatian was shortly afterwards excommunicated: the schismatic church which he established persisted for several centuries (see Novatianism).

==Life==
Few details are known as to his life. He was a man of learning and had been trained in literary composition.

Pope Cornelius, in a letter to Fabius of Antioch, states that a catechumen called Novatian was possessed by Satan for a whole season. &quot;A deep and settled melancholy had fastened on his mind; and the Christians who knew him said that an evil spirit had got possession of him, and that if he would profess Christ the evil spirit would go out of him; so, from a hope of recovering his health, he professed Christianity.&quot; Exorcists attended him, but he fell into a sickness from which imminent death was expected; he was, therefore, given baptism by affusion as he lay on his bed. The rest of the rites were not supplied on his recovery, nor was he confirmed by the bishop. &quot;How then can he have received the Holy Ghost?&quot; asked Cornelius.

For his profound learning, Cornelius sarcastically defined him as &quot;that creator of dogmas, that champion of ecclesiastical culture&quot;, but his eloquence impressed Saint Cyprian of Carthage and Pope Fabian made him a priest despite the protests of the clergy that one who had been baptised only and had not been confirmed could not become a priest.

The story told by Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, that Novatian was an archdeacon of Rome consecrated a priest by the pope in order to prevent his succeeding to the papacy, is contradicted by Cornelius and is based on a later state of affairs in which Roman deacons were statesmen rather than religious ministers.

Novatian became a leading presbyter of the Roman Church, and one of the most noted personages in the Church of the 3rd century. Saint Cyprian of Carthage later accused Novatian of striking his pregnant wife in the stomach and causing an abortion.

==Decian persecution==
On 20 January 250, during the Decian persecution, Pope Fabian was martyred and the persecution was so fierce that it proved impossible to elect a successor, with the papal seat remaining vacant for a year. During this period the church was governed by several priests, including Novatian. In a letter the following year, Cornelius speaks of his rival whose cowardice and love of his own life made him deny to the persecutors that he was a priest and refuse to comfort his brothers in danger. The deacons urged him to come out of hiding, but he told them that he was in love with another philosophy and thus did not want to be a priest any longer. The anonymous work &quot;Ad Novatianum&quot; (XIII) states that Novatian, &quot;so long as he was in the one house, that is in Christ&#x27;s Church, bewailed the sins of his neighbours as if they were his own, bore the burdens of the brethren, as the Apostle exhorts, and strengthened with consolation the backsliding in heavenly faith&quot;.

Novatian wrote two letters during the persecution in the name of the Roman clergy to Saint Cyprian. These letters look at the question of those who had lapsed from the faith and the Carthaginians&#x27; demands for them all to be allowed back into the church without penance. The Roman clergy agreed with Cyprian that the question had to be treated with moderation and balance by a council at the earliest possible opportunity, after the election of a new bishop. In any case, they held that they had to maintain the just church discipline that had marked the Roman church since the time of Saint Paul, without being cruel to those who were penitent. These letters use strong expressions but show that the Roman clergy did not think the readmission of lapsed Christians to communion was entirely impossible.

Novatian disagreed with this viewpoint and believed that reconciling those who had lapsed would compromise the integrity of the Church. Arguing that idolatry was an unforgivable sin and that the church had no right to readmit lapsed members to communion, Novatian argued that the church could admit the penitent to penitence-for-life, but only God could grant forgiveness. Such a position was not completely new, as Tertullian had criticised Pope Callixtus I&#x27;s introduction of pardons for adultery. Even Saint Hippolytus was inclined towards severity, and laws were promulgated in many places and at various times to punish determined sinners with excommunication ending at the hour of death or even refusing them communion in the hour of death.

According to Cyprian, the gravity of this position was not in its cruelty or injustice but in the negation of the church&#x27;s power in such cases to give absolution. Cyprian (Letter LXXV) conceded that Novatian affirmed the baptismal question: &quot;Do you believe in the remission of sins and in the life eternal, through the Holy Church?&quot; However, because Novatian refused to recognize Cornelius as the rightful successor to Peter&#x27;s throne, Cyprian argued that Novatian was a schismatic; and to Cyprian, who had to contend with a comparably lenient faction in Carthage, schismatics who compromised the unity of the Church were worse than apostates.

==Papal candidacy and excommunication==
In March 251, with the emperor Decius&#x27;s death, the persecution began to subside and the Roman community seized the opportunity to nominate a successor to Fabian. Although Novatian was the pre-eminent theologian in Rome, and had a hand in running the Church after the death of Fabian, the moderate Roman aristocrat Cornelius was elected. Those who supported a more rigorist position had Novatian consecrated bishop and refused to recognize Cornelius as Bishop of Rome.

Cornelius and Novatian each sent messengers out to the churches to announce their elections and seek support. Saint Cyprian&#x27;s correspondence tells of an accurate investigation carried out at the end of the Council of Carthage (251), which resulted in the whole African episcopate backing Cornelius. Even Saint Dionysius of Alexandria sided with Cornelius and with this influential support, he soon consolidated his position. However, for some time the church was divided between the two competing popes. Saint Cyprian writes that Novatian &quot;took over&quot; (Letter LXIX, 8) and sent new epistles to many cities to get them to accept his election. Although all the provinces and all the cities held bishops of venerable age, pure faith and proven virtue, who had been proscribed during the persecution, Cyprian writes (Letter LV, 24) that Novatian dared to replace them with new bishops he had created himself.

Meanwhile, in October 251, Cornelius had called a council of 60 bishops (probably all those from Italy and the neighbouring territories) in which Novatian was excommunicated. The bishops unable to attend added their signatures to the council&#x27;s closing document, which was sent to Antioch and all the other main churches. However, Novatian still found supporters among Christians still in prison, such as Maximus, Urbanus and Nicostratus. Dionysius and Cyprian, however, wrote to them and convinced them to support Cornelius. At the beginning of the dispute between Novatian and Cornelius, it took the form of a simple question of a schism, the argument of Cyprian&#x27;s first letters about Novatian (XLIV-XLVIII, 1) focusing on who was the legitimate occupant of St. Peter&#x27;s throne. After a couple of months, this changed, with Cyprian (Letter LIV) finding it necessary to send his book &quot;De lapsis&quot; and letter LV to Rome, with the latter being the first document to speak of the &quot;heresy of Novatian&quot;. Several theologians have subsequently viewed Novatian as a proto protestant.

Novatian died in 258, probably during Valerian&#x27;s persecutions, in the same year as his opponent Cyprian.

<doc id="761904" wikidata="Q669512" url="?curid=761904" title="Reef triggerfish">
<text>The reef triggerfish (Rhinecanthus rectangulus), also known as the rectangular triggerfish, wedgetail triggerfish or by its Hawaiian name  (, meaning &#x27;triggerfish with a snout like a pig&#x27;, also spelled humuhumunukunukuapua&#x27;a or just humuhumu for short), is one of several species of triggerfish. It is found in coral reefs in the entirety of the Western Pacific Ocean from North to South and Eastern Central Pacific. It is also found it the Indian Ocean from East to West and the Southeast Atlantic Ocean. It exists in 0 to 50 meters in depth.
==Description==

It has a small second dorsal spine which is used to lock its main spine into an upright position. When sheltering in a small crevice, this locking helps protect the fish against extraction by a predator.

The reef triggerfish is characterized by having a noticeably large snout and blue lips that resemble that of a pig’s snout. It has strong teeth and a terminal mouth which help aid in scraping food off surfaces. Along the dorsal side and anterior end of the fish, it has an orange-brown coloration and a white belly. The reef triggerfish has 3 dorsal spines, 22–25 dorsal rays, no anal spines, and 20–22 anal soft rays. The soft dorsal fins, anal fins, and pectoral fins have a pale white coloration to it. The caudal fin has a cloudy murky color.

The reef triggerfish is commonly confused with its two closest living relatives the lagoon triggerfish and picasso triggerfish.

==Feeding==

The reef triggerfish has a terminal mouth that sits directly at the end of its snout. It has heavy teeth and incisors, and most of its food content is algae that is scraped off surfaces. It also feeds on crustaceans such as isopods from the sandy ocean floors. When foraging for food it remains close to its home or forages in shallow reefs away from living coral. This fish is considered a facultative omnivore because while it eats plants and animals it can sustain itself on a diet of either or.

==Sounds==

The reef triggerfish is recorded to make three distinct sounds that have been categorized as grinding, drumming, grunting, and snapping. Attached is a recording of what drumming sounds are.

The grinding sounds are heard when eating. This is thought to be a signal used to indicate to other reef triggerfish that the territory is theirs. It is also believed that it is used to advertise their territories to attract females.

Drumming sounds occur by flapping the pelvic fins from the sonic membrane creating a vibration connection to the swim bladder. The swim bladder acts as a chamber to produce low and high-frequency sounds. Drum rates increase when there are predators around which can serve as an antipredation function. These drumming sounds are similar to grunting sounds which both involve the use of the swim bladder. Grunts are identical to that of a pig grunt and are mostly audible and recorded when physically holding the fish.

Snaps occur by the rapid extensions and retraction of the jaw. Audibly there are no real differences between a snap and a grinding sound however they occur at different frequencies and settings. The snaps are most observed during conspecific interactions such as territorial conflict. Although the true meaning of the snaps remains a mystery reef triggerfish show no signs of kin selection.

==Swimming==

Fish in the Balistidae family, like the reef triggerfish, have unique and adaptive swimming motions. Triggerfish are thought to have low swimming maneuvers to compensate for such behavior there are morphological adaptations. These fish have thick skin to aid in predation evasion. While swimming at low speeds their flexibility in dorsal and anal fins makes it capable for them to exhibit balistiform locomotion. Within these fins, they are also able to independently move them and generate their own thrust allowing them to move in all sorts of directions including backwards and hover in place.

The muscle of reef triggerfish are red which are ideal for fish that are constantly on the move, much like this species of triggerfish. Since this fish is always hunting for prey, foraging, and defending its territory. They also have white muscle that is effective in quick bursts of movement and helps aid them in complex maneuvers.

==Life History==

While there is limited direct information on reproductive modes and strategies for the reef triggerfish behaviors within triggerfish overlap one another. Examining the reproductive behavior of the picasso triggerfish one conclusion that can be drawn is that reef triggerfish exhibit similar behaviors.

Both female and male picasso triggerfish are territorial in space for foraging and egg spawning. While the female’s criteria is based on the amount of food resources, low predation, and space that is available, a male’s territory is determined by dominance. In the male’s case, a haremic mating system is placed where the more dominant males have more access to female mates. This is meant to increase the reproductive success of males however, while defending a female it can leave other females vulnerable to other males decreasing the reproductive success of the original male.

Males will generally invest more energy and resources in physical growth rather than reproduction. Females will invest more in reaching sexual maturity than halting physical growth. The difference in these life strategies reveals that females are smaller in size compared to males, but also an age difference.

==Conservation Status==

Currently under the IUCN Red List, the reef triggerfish is listed as least concern. Although because the reef triggerfish is found to live in coral reefs there are still many threats that may present themselves in the future. Currently one major threat is that of global warming and its effects on coral reefs which decrease oxygen levels and can increase hypoxia in reef triggerfish. However, one study found that reef triggerfish can tolerate high levels of hypoxia.

==Hawaii state fish==
The reef triggerfish was designated the official fish of Hawaii in 1985, but due to an expiration of a Hawaiian state law after five years, it ceased to be the state fish in 1990. On April 17, 2006, bill HB1982 was presented to the Governor of Hawaii, which permanently reinstated the reef triggerfish () as the state fish of Hawaii. The bill passed into law on May 2, 2006.

The reef triggerfish also holds cultural values to the Hawaii natives although it is not endemic to the Hawaiian waters. This triggerfish is thought to be connected to the Hawaiian pig god Kamapua’a. Kamapua’a was notorious for his violent behaviors, he ended up marrying fire goddess Pele but because of his behavior, they began fighting. Pele fought with lava and Kamapua’a with control over the ocean waters. Pele requested the help of the underworld and other gods, and together they drove Kamapua’a over a cliff where he fell into the ocean water becoming the reef triggerfish.

<text>The Catalan and Valencian [[orthography|orthographies]] encompass the spelling and punctuation of standard Catalan (set by the IEC) and Valencian (set by the AVL). There are also several adapted variants to the peculiarities of local dialects of Insular Catalan (Alguerese and the Balearic subdialects).

==History==
The history of the Catalan and Valencian orthographies shows a singularity in regard to the other Romance languages. These have been mostly developed from Latin, adapting them to their own phonetic particularities. It had been a gradual and slow process through centuries until the creation of the Academies in the 18th century that fixed the orthography from their language dominant variety.

In the case of Catalan and Valencian, the mediaeval orthography had a noticeable homogeneity. The Royal Chancellery set a unitary written model in several fields. Thus, Ramon Muntaner expressed in his Chronicle (1325–1328) that the Catalans are the largest group with a single language, since all the Romance-speaking regions had very divided languages like the difference that exists between Catalans and Aragonese.

In the 16th century, just after the Golden Age, the split of Catalans started. With the isolation of the Royal Court and several political events, the unitary linguistic consciousness and the shared cultural tradition broke off. The production became more dialectal.

In the 19th century, the recovery of the unity emerged, beginning with the orthography. Institutions like the &quot;Acadèmia de Bones Lletres&quot; or the Floral Games were in the middle of several orthographic dilemmas.

The orthographic norms of Catalan were first defined officially in the First Internationals Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona in October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot; (IEC, founded in 1911) published the &quot;Normes ortogràfiques&quot; in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. Despite some opposition, the spelling system was adopted immediately and became widespread enough that, in 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló to make a formal adoption of the so-called &quot;Normes de Castelló&quot;, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra&#x27;s Catalan language norms.

In 1917, Fabra published an Orthographic Dictionary following the orthographic norms of the IEC. In 1931–1932 the &quot;Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana&quot; (General Dictionary of the Catalan language) appeared.  In 1995, a new normative dictionary, the Dictionary of the Catalan Language of the Institute of Catalan Studies (DIEC), marked a new milestone in the orthographic fixation of the language, in addition to the incorporation of neologisms and modern uses of the language.
On the 24th October 2016, the IEC published a new orthography for Catalan, the , which outlined several modifications, including a reduced number of monosyllabic words that take an acute or grave diacritic for reasons of disambiguation. Thus, the disyllabic word is now generally spelled ; the monosyllabic words (&quot;dry&quot;, pronounced in Central Catalan) and (&quot;fold, wrinkle&quot;, pronounced ) are both written after the reform. Discretionary use of a diacritic is possible if the context is not sufficient for disambiguation.

==Alphabet==
Like those of many other Romance languages, the Catalan and Valencian alphabet derives from the Latin alphabet and is largely based on the respective language&#x27;s phonology.

The Catalan and Valencian alphabet consists of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet:

The following letter-diacritic combinations are used, but they do not constitute distinct letters in the alphabet: &quot;À à&quot;, &quot;É é&quot;, &quot;È è&quot;, &quot;Í í&quot;, &quot;Ï ï&quot;, &quot;Ó ó&quot;, &quot;Ò ò&quot;, &quot;Ú ú&quot;, &quot;Ü ü&quot; and &quot;Ç ç&quot; (though the Catalan keyboard includes the letter &quot;Ç&quot; as a separate key). &quot;K k&quot; and &quot;W w&quot; are used only in loanwords. Outside loanwords, the letters &quot;Q q&quot; and &quot;Y y&quot; appear only in the digraphs &quot;qu&quot;, &quot;qü&quot; and &quot;ny&quot;. However, &quot;Y&quot; was used until the official orthography was established in 1913, when it was replaced with &quot;I&quot;, except in the digraph &quot;ny&quot; and loanwords. Some Catalan surnames conserve the letter &quot;y&quot; and the word-final digraph &quot;ch&quot; (pronounced ), e. g. , .

The following table shows the letters and their names in Standard Catalan (IEC) and Standard Valencian (AVL):

The names &quot;efa&quot; (), &quot;ela&quot; (), &quot;ema&quot; (), &quot;ena&quot; (), &quot;erra&quot; (), and &quot;essa&quot; () are also used in certain speeches of Valencian.
The names &quot;be alta&quot; (&quot;high b&quot;) and &quot;ve baixa&quot; (&quot;low v&quot;) are used by speakers who do not distinguish the phonemes and . Speakers that do distinguish them use the simple names &quot;be&quot; and &quot;ve&quot;.
==Spelling and pronunciation==

Catalan is a pluricentric language; the pronunciation of some of the letters is different in Central Eastern Catalan (IEC) and Valencian (AVL). Apart from those variations, the pronunciation of most consonants is fairly straightforward and is similar to French, Occitan or Portuguese pronunciation.

===Spelling-to-sound correspondences===
The following lists includes a quick pronunciation of letters in standard Catalan and Valencian, for an in-depth view see attached main article on top of this section.

===Sound-to-spelling correspondences===
The following lists include most sound-to-spelling correspondences in Catalan and Valencian. It also includes gemination as well as more foreign spellings than previous lists (as it is easier to represent them in the charts). 

==The letters==

===The representation of the sounds [ɡ] and [k]===
The voiced stop sound {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (or the corresponding fricative variant {{IPA|[ɣ]}}) is represented by the spellings {{lang|ca|g}} and {{lang|ca|gu}}, and the voiceless stop sound {{IPA|[k]}}, by the spellings {{lang|ca|c}}, {{lang|ca|q}}, {{lang|ca|qu}} and, sporadically, {{lang|ca|g}} and {{lang|ca|k}}.

At the beginning of a syllable, the sounds {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}:

:a) They are represented by {{lang|ca|g}} and {{lang|ca|c}}, respectively, before the vowels {{lang|ca|a}}, {{lang|ca|o}}, {{lang|ca|u}}, or when they are followed by the liquid consonants {{lang|ca|l}}, {{lang|ca|r}}: {{lang|ca|gat}} (&#x27;cat&#x27;), {{lang|ca|govern}} (&#x27;government&#x27;), {{lang|ca|gust}} (&#x27;taste&#x27;), {{lang|ca|glop}} (&#x27;gulp&#x27;), {{lang|ca|groc}} (&#x27;yellow&#x27;); {{lang|ca|casa}} (&#x27;house&#x27;), {{lang|ca|colom}} (&#x27;pigeon&#x27;), {{lang|ca|acurtar}} (&#x27;to shorten&#x27;), {{lang|ca|clam}} (&#x27;clamor&#x27;), {{lang|ca|cremar}} (&#x27;to burn&#x27;).

:b) They are represented by {{lang|ca|gu}} and {{lang|ca|qu}}, respectively, before the vowels {{lang|ca|e}}, {{lang|ca|i}}: {{lang|ca|guerra}} (&#x27;war&#x27;), {{lang|ca|seguir}} (&#x27;to follow&#x27;); {{lang|ca|quimera}} (&#x27;chimera&#x27;), {{lang|ca|paquet}} (&#x27;package, parcel&#x27;).

In the case of the sound {{IPA|[k]}}, in addition:

:c) It is represented by {{lang|ca|q}} when it precedes a rising diphthong: {{lang|ca|conseqüència}} (&#x27;consequence&#x27;), {{lang|ca|quota}} (&#x27;share, fee&#x27;).
:d) The spelling {{lang|ca|k}} is used only in certain words from non-Romance languages: {{lang|ca|kàiser}} (&#x27;kaiser&#x27;), {{lang|ca|kantisme}} (&#x27;Kantianism&#x27;), {{lang|ca|kurd}} (&#x27;Kurdish&#x27;).

At the end of a syllable, in the inner or final position of the word, the opposition between the unvoiced and the voiced consonant is neutralized, to the extent that it ceases to be distinctive. Regardless of the pronunciation, which can be unvoiced or voiced depending on the phonic context, the use of the spellings {{lang|ca|c}} or {{lang|ca|g}} conforms to the following rules:

:e) Within a word, {{lang|ca|c}} is written before {{lang|ca|c}}, {{lang|ca|t}}, {{lang|ca|s}}; instead, {{lang|ca|g}} is written before {{lang|ca|d}}, {{lang|ca|m}}, {{lang|ca|n}}: {{lang|ca|acció}} (&#x27;action&#x27;), {{lang|ca|actriu}} (&#x27;actress&#x27;), {{lang|ca|dacsa}} (&#x27;corn&#x27;); {{lang|ca|amígdala}} (&#x27;tonsil&#x27;), {{lang|ca|fragment}} (&#x27;fragment&#x27;), {{lang|ca|magnitud}} (&#x27;magnitude&#x27;).

:f) At the end of an acute word (oxytone), {{lang|ca|c}} is written after a vowel: {{lang|ca|alifac}} (&#x27;infirmity&#x27;), {{lang|ca|batec}} (&#x27;beat&#x27;), {{lang|ca|pessic}} (&#x27;pinch&#x27;), {{lang|ca|albercoc}} (&#x27;apricot&#x27;), {{lang|ca|caduc}} (&#x27;caducous&#x27;) and the first person of the present indicative of certain verbs of the second conjugation ({{lang|ca|bec}} &#x27;I drink&#x27;, {{lang|ca|dec}} &#x27;I owe&#x27;, {{lang|ca|dic}} &#x27;I say&#x27;, {{lang|ca|trac}} &#x27;I take out&#x27;, etc.).

Instead, {{lang|ca|g}} or {{lang|ca|c}} is written, depending on the spelling of the derivatives, at the end of an acute word after another consonant or at the end of a plain word after a vowel:

::{{lang|ca|fang}} (&#x27;mud&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|fangar}} (&#x27;place full of mud&#x27;)
::{{lang|ca|llarg}} (&#x27;long&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|llargària}} (&#x27;length&#x27;)
::{{lang|ca|pròdig}} (&#x27;prodigal&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|prodigar}} (&#x27;to waste, to lavish&#x27;)

::{{lang|ca|blanc}} (&#x27;white&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|blancor}} (&#x27;whiteness&#x27;)
::{{lang|ca|arc}} (&#x27;arch&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|arcada}} (&#x27;arcade, retching&#x27;)
::{{lang|ca|pràctic}} (&#x27;practical&#x27;) ↔ {{lang|ca|practicar}} (&#x27;to practice&#x27;)

:EXCEPTIONS: It is written {{lang|ca|c}}, despite having derivatives with {{lang|ca|g}}, in some plain or grave words (paroxytones), like {{lang|ca|aràbic}} &#x27;Arabic&#x27;, {{lang|ca|bròfec}} (&#x27;sullen, scorched&#x27;), {{lang|ca|càrrec}} (&#x27;charge, position [work]&#x27;), {{lang|ca|espàrrec}} (&#x27;asparagus&#x27;), etc.

:NOTE: In the past, the digraph {{lang|ca|ch}} was used in final position, to represent the sound {{IPA|[k]}}, spelling that is still preserved in some lineages: {{lang|ca|Doménech}} &#x27;Doménech&#x27;, {{lang|ca|March}} &#x27;March&#x27;, {{lang|ca|Pitarch}} &#x27;Pitarch&#x27;, {{lang|ca|Estruch}} &#x27;Estruch&#x27;, etc.

===The spellings b and v===
Although some Valencian speakers differentiate the voiced occlusive bilabial sound {{IPA|[b]}} from the voiced labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}}, to avoid confusion in the use of the spellings {{lang|ca|b}} and {{lang|ca|v}} it is necessary to take into account that {{lang|ca|b}} is written in the following cases:

:a) Before {{lang|ca|l}} and {{lang|ca|r}}: {{lang|ca|bleda}} (&#x27;chard, a passive person&#x27;), {{lang|ca|bromera}} (&#x27;froth, lather&#x27;).

===The spellings d and t===
The voiced occlusive dental sound {{IPA|[d]}} (or the corresponding fricative variant {{IPA|[ð]}}) is represented by the spelling {{lang|ca|d}}, and its voiceless correlate {{IPA|[t]}}, by the spelling {{lang|ca|t}}: {{lang|ca|donar}} (&#x27;to give&#x27;), {{lang|ca|banda}} (&#x27;side, band&#x27;), {{lang|ca|badar}} (&#x27;to open [up], to be careless&#x27;); {{lang|ca|tallar}} (&#x27;to cut&#x27;), {{lang|ca|contar}} (&#x27;to tell, to say&#x27;), {{lang|ca|gaiato}} (&#x27;shepherd&#x27;s crook&#x27;).

At the end of a syllable, in internal or word-final position, the opposition between voiceless and voiced consonants is neutralized.

==Diacritics==

===Accentuation===
====Acute and grave accents====
Catalan and Valencian also use the acute and grave accents to mark stress or vowel quality. An acute on {{angbr|é ó}} indicates that the vowel is stressed and close-mid ({{IPA|/e o/}}), while grave on {{angbr|è ò}} indicates that the vowel is stressed and open-mid ({{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}}). Grave on {{angbr|à}} and acute on {{angbr|í ú}} simply indicate that the vowels are stressed. Thus, the acute is used on close or close-mid vowels, and the grave on open or open-mid vowels. For example:
* &quot;també&quot;: {{IPA|/təmˈbe/}} or {{IPA|/tamˈbe/}} (&#x27;also&#x27;)
* &quot;èxtasi&quot;: {{IPA|/ˈɛkstəzi/}} or {{IPA|/ˈɛkstazi/}} (&#x27;ecstasy&#x27;)
* &quot;córrer&quot;: {{IPA|/ˈkorə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkoreɾ/}} (&#x27;to run&#x27;)
* &quot;pròxim&quot;: {{IPA|/ˈpɾɔksim/}} (&#x27;nearby&#x27;)
* &quot;ànima&quot;: {{IPA|/ˈanimə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈanima/}} (&#x27;soul&#x27;)
* &quot;pastís&quot;: {{IPA|/pəsˈtis/}} or {{IPA|/pasˈtis/}} (&#x27;pie&#x27;)
* &quot;fúcsia&quot;: {{IPA|/ˈfuksiə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈfuksia/}} (&#x27;fuchsia&#x27;)

Standard rules governing the presence of accents are based on word endings and the position of the stressed syllable. In particular, accents are expected for:
* Oxytones ending in a syllabic vowel, a vowel + -{{angbr|s}}, or -{{angbr|en}}/{{angbr|in}}, examples:
**&quot;parlà&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈla/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈla/}} (&#x27;he spoke&#x27;)
**&quot;parlés&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈles/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈles/}} (&#x27;that he spoke&#x27; past subjunctive)
**&quot;entén&quot; {{IPA|/ənˈten/}} or {{IPA|/enˈten/}} (&#x27;he understands&#x27;)
:This does not occur in words like &quot;parleu&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈlɛw/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈlɛw/}} (&#x27;you are speaking&#x27; plural), or &quot;parlem&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈlɛm/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈlɛm/}} (&#x27;we are speaking&#x27;).
* Paroxytones with any other ending, including non-syllabic -{{angbr|i}}, -{{angbr|u}}, examples:
**&quot;parlàveu&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈlabəw/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈlavew/}} (&#x27;you were speaking&#x27; plural)
**&quot;parlàvem&quot; {{IPA|/pəɾˈlabəm/}} or {{IPA|/paɾˈlavem/}} (&#x27;we were speaking&#x27;)
:This does not occur in words like &quot;parla&quot; {{IPA|/ˈpaɾlə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpaɾla/}} (&#x27;he is speaking&#x27;), &quot;parles&quot; {{IPA|/ˈpaɾləs/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpaɾles/}} (&#x27;you are speaking&#x27; singular), or &quot;parlen&quot; {{IPA|/ˈpaɾlən/}} or {{IPA|/ˈpaɾlen/}} (&#x27;they are speaking&#x27;).
* Any proparoxytones, examples:
**&quot;química&quot; {{IPA|/ˈkimikə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkimika/}} (&#x27;chemistry&#x27;)
**&quot;ciència&quot; {{IPA|/siˈɛnsiə/}} or {{IPA|/siˈɛnsia/}} (&#x27;science&#x27;)

Since there is no need to mark the stressed syllable of a monosyllabic word, most of them do not have an accent. Exceptions are those with a diacritical accent differentiating words that would otherwise be homographic. Example: &quot;es&quot; {{IPA|/əs/}} or {{IPA|/es/}} (&#x27;it&#x27; impersonal) vs &quot;és&quot; {{IPA|/ˈes/}} (&#x27;is&#x27;), &quot;te&quot; {{IPA|/tə/}} or {{IPA|/te/}} (&#x27;you&#x27; clitic) vs &quot;té&quot; {{IPA|/ˈte/}} (&#x27;s/he has&#x27;), &quot;mes&quot; {{IPA|/ˈmɛs/}} or {{IPA|/ˈmes/}} (&#x27;month&#x27;) vs &quot;més&quot; {{IPA|/ˈmes/}} (&#x27;more&#x27;), &quot;dona&quot; {{IPA|/ˈdɔnə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈdɔna/}} (&#x27;woman&#x27;) vs &quot;dóna&quot; {{IPA|/ˈdonə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈdona/}} (&#x27;s/he gives&#x27;). In most cases, the word bearing no accent is either unstressed (as in the case of &#x27;es&#x27; and &#x27;te&#x27;), or the word without the accent is more common, usually a function word.

The different distribution of &quot;open e&quot; {{IPA|/ɛ/}} vs &quot;closed e&quot; {{IPA|/e/}} between Eastern Catalan and Western Catalan is reflected in some orthographic divergences between standard Catalan and Valencian norms, for example: {{Lang|ca|anglès}} {{IPA|/əŋˈɡlɛs/}} (Catalan) vs {{Lang|ca|anglés}} {{IPA|/aŋˈɡles/}} (Valencian) (&#x27;English&#x27;). In the Balearic Islands, open e {{IPA|/ɛ/}} tends to be a centralised e ({{IPA|/ə/}}) in the same cases where &quot;open e&quot; contrasts with &quot;closed e&quot; in Catalan and Valencian. The cases where the difference of pronunciation of &quot;e&quot; can have graphical repercussions are the followings:
*Words ending with the demonym -&quot;es&quot; (&quot;anglès&quot; / &quot;anglés&quot; &#x27;English&#x27;, &quot;francès&quot; / &quot;francés&quot; &#x27;French&#x27;), the past participles (&quot;admès&quot; / &quot;admés&quot; &#x27;admitted&#x27;, &quot;compromès&quot; / &quot;compromés&quot; &#x27;committed&#x27;) and adjectives (&quot;cortès&quot; / &quot;cortés&quot; &#x27;courteous&#x27;).
*The ordinal numerals ending in stressed &quot;e&quot;: &quot;cinquè&quot; / &quot;cinqué&quot; (&#x27;fifth&#x27;), &quot;sisè&quot; / &quot;sisé&quot; (&#x27;sixth&#x27;).
*The ending of the third person of the plural of indicative -&quot;en&quot; of some verbs of the 2nd conjugation (&quot;aprèn&quot; / &quot;aprén&quot; &#x27;learn&#x27;, &quot;comprèn&quot; / &quot;comprén&quot; &#x27;comprehend&#x27;, &quot;depèn&quot; / &quot;depén&quot; &#x27;depend&#x27;), except in the cases where this ending is preceded by the consonant &quot;t&quot; or &quot;c&quot;, where it is pronounced with a closed &quot;e&quot; in all speeches (&quot;atén&quot; &#x27;attend&#x27;, &quot;entén&quot; &#x27;understand&#x27;, &quot;pretén&quot; &#x27;pretend&#x27;, &quot;encén&quot; &#x27;switch on&#x27;).
*The infinitives ending in -&quot;eixer&quot; (&quot;conèixer&quot; / &quot;conéixer&quot; &#x27;to know&#x27;, &quot;merèixer&quot; / &quot;meréixer&quot; &#x27;to deserve&#x27;, &quot;parèixer&quot; / &quot;paréixer&quot; &#x27;to seem&#x27;, but uniquely &quot;créixer&quot; &#x27;to grow&#x27;) and -&quot;encer&quot; (&quot;vèncer&quot; / &quot;véncer&quot; &#x27;to win&#x27;, &quot;convèncer&quot; / &quot;convéncer&quot; &#x27;to convince&#x27;).
*The second and third person of the plural of the simple past tense of indicative with accent on the radical: &quot;fèiem&quot; / &quot;féiem&quot; &#x27;we did&#x27;, &quot;fèieu&quot; / &quot;féieu&quot; &#x27;you pl. did&#x27;.

====Circumflex====
The circumflex is rarely used in modern Catalan and Valencian, nonetheless it has been used in the beginning of the 19th century by Antoni Febrer i Cardona to represent schwa in the Balearic subdialects. According to the &quot;Diccionari català-valencià-balear&quot;, in modern times there are some cases where the circumflex can be used to indicate silent etymological sounds (similar to French) or a contraction. Contrary to the restrictions of the acute and grave accent, the circumflex can be used with all vowels {{angbr|â ê î ô û}}, the most common, especially in Valencian, being {{angbr|â}} (i.e. due to the elision of {{IPA|/d/}}), e.g. &quot;mascletâes&quot; (instead of &quot;mascletades&quot; &#x27;pyrotechnic festivals&#x27;), &quot;anâ&quot; (instead of &quot;anar&quot; &#x27;to go&#x27;), &quot;témê&quot; (instead of &quot;témer&quot; &#x27;to fear&#x27;), &quot;sortî&quot; (instead of &quot;sortir&quot; &#x27;to exit&#x27;), &quot;pâ&quot; (&#x27;to&#x27;, preposition in colloquial Valencian).

===Diaeresis===
The diaeresis has two different uses: to mark hiatus over {{angbr|ï, ü}}, and to mark that {{angbr|u}} is not silent in the groups {{angbr|gü, qü}}.

If a diaeresis appears over an {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|u}} that follows another vowel, it denotes a hiatus, examples: 
*&quot;raïm&quot; {{IPA|/rəˈim/}} or {{IPA|/raˈim/}} (&#x27;grape&#x27;)
*&quot;taüt&quot; {{IPA|/təˈut/}} or {{IPA|/taˈut/}} (&#x27;coffin&#x27;)
This diaeresis is not used over a stressed vowel that already should have an accent. Examples: &quot;suís&quot; {{IPA|/suˈis/}} (&#x27;Swiss&#x27; masculine), but &quot;suïssa&quot; {{IPA|/suˈisə/}} or {{IPA|/suˈisa/}} (&#x27;Swiss&#x27; feminine), &quot;suïs&quot; {{IPA|/ˈsuis/}} (&#x27;that you sweat&#x27; subjunctive) (without the diaeresis, this last example would be pronounced {{IPA|/ˈsui̯s/}}, i.e. as only one syllable, like &quot;reis&quot; {{IPA|/ˈrei̯s/}} &#x27;kings&#x27;).

Certain verb forms of verbs ending in &quot;-uir&quot; do not receive a diaeresis, although they are pronounced with separate syllables. This concerns the infinitive, gerund, future and conditional forms (for example &quot;traduir&quot;, &quot;traduint&quot;, &quot;traduiré&quot; and &quot;traduiria&quot;, all with bisyllabic {{IPA|/u.i/}}). All other forms of such verbs do receive a diaeresis on the &quot;ï&quot; according to the normal rules (e.g. &quot;traduïm&quot;, &quot;traduïa&quot;).

In addition to this, {{angbr|ü}} represents {{IPA|/w/}} between a velar consonant {{IPA|/ɡ/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} and a front vowel ({{angbr|gu}} and {{angbr|qu}} are used to represent a hard (i.e. velar) pronunciation before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}}).
*&quot;ungüent&quot; {{IPA|/uŋˈɡwen(t)/}} (&#x27;ointment&#x27;)
*&quot;qüestió&quot; {{IPA|/kwəstiˈo/}} or {{IPA|/kwestiˈo/}} (&#x27;topic&#x27;)

Forms of the verb &quot;argüir&quot; represents a rare case of the sequence {{IPA|/ɡu.i/}}, and the rules for {{IPA|/gu/}} and {{IPA|/ui/}} clash in this case. The ambiguity is resolved by an additional rule, which states that in cases where diaereses would appear on two consecutive letters, only the second receives one. This thus gives &quot;arguïm /arguˈim/, i.e.&quot; and &quot;arguïa /arguˈia/,&quot; but &quot;argüir /arˈgwir/,&quot; &quot;argüint /arˈgwint/&quot; and &quot;argüiré&quot; &quot;/argwiˈre/&quot; as these forms don&#x27;t receive a diaeresis on the &quot;i&quot; normally, according to the exception above.

===&quot;Ce trencada&quot; (c-cedilla)===
Catalan and Valencian &quot;ce trencada&quot; (Ç ç), literally in English &#x27;broken cee&#x27;, is a modified {{angbr|c}} with a cedilla mark ( ¸ ). It is only used before {{angbr|a u o}} to indicate a &quot;soft c&quot; {{IPA|/s/}}, much like in Portuguese, Occitan or French (e.g. compare &quot;coça&quot; {{IPA|/ˈkosə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkosa/}} &#x27;kick&#x27;, &quot;coca&quot; {{IPA|/ˈkokə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkoka/}} &#x27;cake&#x27; and &quot;cosa&quot; {{IPA|/ˈkɔzə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkɔza/}} &#x27;thing&#x27;). In Catalan and Valencian, &quot;ce trencada&quot; also appears as last letter of a word (e.g. &quot;feliç&quot; {{IPA|/fəˈlis/}} or {{IPA|/feˈlis/}} &#x27;happy&#x27;, &quot;falç&quot; {{IPA|/ˈfals/}} &#x27;sickle&#x27;), but then {{angbr|ç}} may be voiced to {{IPA|[z]}} before vowels and voiced consonants, e.g. &quot;feliçment&quot; {{IPA|/fəˌlizˈmen(t)/}} or {{IPA|/feˌlizˈmen(t)/}} (&#x27;happily&#x27;) and &quot;braç esquerre&quot; {{IPA|/ˈbɾaz əsˈkɛrə/}} or {{IPA|/ˈbɾaz esˈkɛre/}} (&#x27;left arm&#x27;).

==Capitalization==
Catalan and Valencian do not capitalize the days of the week, months, or national adjectives.{{sfn|Swan|2001|p=97}}
::&quot;dilluns&quot;, &quot;setembre&quot;, &quot;anglès&quot;
::&#x27;Monday&#x27;, &#x27;September&#x27;, &#x27;English&#x27;

==Punctuation==
Catalan and Valencian punctuation rules are similar to English, with some minor differences.{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=620}}
*Guillemets (&quot;cometes baixes&quot;) &quot;« »&quot; are frequently used instead of double inverted commas. They are used to mark titles of works, or phrases used as proper names.{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=620}}
*In texts containing dialogue, quoted speech is usually set off with dashes, rather than inverted commas.{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=620}}
::—&quot;Què proposes, doncs?&quot;
::—&quot;El que hauríem de fer —s&#x27;atreví a suggerir— és anar a...&quot;
::&#x27;What do you propose, then?&#x27;
::&#x27;What we should do&#x27; she ventured to suggest &#x27;is go to and ...&#x27;
*Questions are ended with &quot;?&quot;, as in English.{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=620}} Before 1993, questions could be enclosed with &quot;¿...?&quot;, as in Spanish, but this is no longer recommended by the IEC.{{sfn|Wheeler|Yates|Dols|1999|p=620}}

===&quot;Punt volat&quot; (middot)===
The &quot;punt volat&quot; or middot is only used in the sequence {{angbr|ŀl}} (called &quot;ela&quot; or &quot;el(e) geminada&quot;, &#x27;geminate el&#x27;) to represent a geminated sound {{IPA|/lː/}} (often simplified to {{IPA|/l/}}, especially in Valencian), as the digraph {{angbr|ll}} is used for the palatal lateral {{IPA|/ʎ/}}. This usage of the middot sign dates to the beginning of twentieth century; in medieval and modern Catalan, before Fabra&#x27;s standardization, it was sometimes used to note certain elisions, especially in poetry. The only (and improbable) possibility of ambiguity in the whole language is the pair &quot;ceŀla&quot; {{IPA|/ˈsɛlːa/}} (&#x27;cell&#x27;) vs &quot;cella&quot; {{IPA|/ˈseʎa/}} (&#x27;eyebrow&#x27;).

===Hyphen===
The hyphen (called a &quot;guionet&quot;) is used in Catalan and Valencian to separate a verb and the combination of pronouns that follow them (e.g. &quot;menjar-se-les&quot;), to separate certain compounds (e.g. &quot;vint-i-un&quot; and &quot;para-sol&quot;), and to split a word at the end of a line of text for the purpose of maintaining page margins.

Compounds are hyphenated in cases that involve numerals (e.g. &quot;trenta-sis&quot;, and &quot;trenta-sisè&quot;/&quot;é&quot;); cardinal points (e.g. &quot;sud-americà&quot;); repetitive and expressive compounds (&quot;xup-xup&quot;); those compounds in which the first element ends in a vowel and the second starts with {{angbr|r}}, {{angbr|s}}, or {{angbr|x}} (e.g. &quot;penya-segat&quot;); and those compounds in which the combination of the two elements can lead to wrong reading (e.g. &quot;pit-roig&quot;). There are also compound terms in which the first element carries a grave accent (&quot;mà-llarg&quot;), the construction &quot;no&quot; plus substantive{{clarify|date=September 2021}} (but not &quot;no&quot; plus adjective, &quot;no-violència&quot; but the &quot;nacions no violentes&quot;) and certain singular constructions like &quot;abans-d&#x27;ahir&quot; and &quot;adéu-siau&quot;.

Since 1996, the normative set that in the none mentioned cases in the previous paragraph do not carry hyphen. Thus, the general norm set that the prefixed forms, aside from the cited exceptions, are written without hyphen (the only normative option, then, is to write &quot;arxienemic&quot; and &quot;fisicoquímic&quot;).{{clarify|date=September 2021}}

In regard to numbers, hyphen is set according to the D-U-C rule (&quot;Desenes-Unitats-Centenes&quot;, &#x27;Tens-Units-Hundreds&#x27;), thus, a hyphen is placed between tens and units (&quot;quaranta-dos&quot;) and between units and hundreds (&quot;tres-cents&quot;). For example, the number 35,422 is written &quot;trenta-cinc mil quatre-cents vint-i-dos&quot;.

In the case of the separation of a term at the end of line, syllable boundaries are maintained. Still, there are digraphs that can be separated and others that cannot. The digraphs that can be separated are those that, when splitting them, they result in two graphs the corresponding sound from which they share a phonetic trait with the sound of the digraph. (Thus, the digraph rr, for example it corresponds with the nearest sound of a rhotic alveolar trill. &quot;Cor-randes&quot;, &quot;calit-ja&quot; and &quot;as-sas-sí&quot; are words with digraphs that can be split). The digraphs that cannot be separated are those in which the two graphs correspond to sounds that they are not related with the sound of the digraph. (For example, the digraph &quot;ny&quot; cannot be separated.)

To orthographic effects, the syllabic separation of words follow the following norms:

* The following digraphs and combination of letters can be separated:
:: ix (&quot;quei-xa&quot;), rr (&quot;car-rer&quot;), ss (&quot;pas-sar&quot;), sc (&quot;es-ce-na&quot;), l·l (&quot;vil-la&quot;), tj (&quot;jut-jat&quot;), tg (&quot;fet-ge&quot;), tx (&quot;pit-xer&quot;), tl (&quot;vet-la&quot;), tll (&quot;rot-llo&quot;), tm (&quot;rit-me&quot;), tn (&quot;cot-na&quot;), ts (&quot;pot-ser&quot;), tx (&quot;despat-xar&quot;), tz (&quot;set-ze&quot;), mm (&quot;im-mens&quot;), nn (&quot;in-no-cent&quot;)
* The following digraphs cannot be separated:
:: gu (&quot;jo-guet&quot;), ny (&quot;pe-nya&quot;), qu (&quot;pa-quet&quot;), ig (&quot;ba-teig&quot;), ll (&quot;pe-lle-ter&quot;)
* The constituents of a compound, or the prefix of a prefixed word, can be separated:
:: &quot;ad-herir&quot;, &quot;in-expert&quot;, &quot;ben-estar&quot;, &quot;mil-hòmens&quot;, &quot;des-encolar&quot;, &quot;vos-altres&quot;
* Letters cannot be left on their own at the end or beginning of a line:
:: &quot;d&#x27;a-mor&quot;, &quot;aber-rant&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;a-plicació&quot;, &quot;histò-ria&quot;

===Apostrophe===
Catalan and Valencian follow some apostrophization rules that serve to determine whether it is necessary to use an apostrophe (&#x27;) with an article, preposition or pronoun or not if the word that follows it or precedes it begins or finishes in a vowel, respectively.

;Article
The masculine singular article (&quot;el&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, and dialectally also &quot;lo&quot;, in Continental Catalan, and &quot;es&quot; and &quot;so&quot; in Balearic, the so called salted article, with &quot;s&quot;) is apostrophized before all words of masculine gender that begin with a vowel, e.g. &quot;l&#x27;avió&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;encant&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;odi&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;Albert&quot;, &quot;s&#x27;arbre&quot;; with a silent &quot;h&quot;, e.g. &quot;l&#x27;home&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;ham&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;Hug&quot;, &quot;s&#x27;home&quot;; with a liquid &quot;s&quot;, e.g. &quot;l&#x27;spa&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;Stuttgart&quot;. It is not apostrophized before of words that begin with a consonantic i or u (with or without h), &quot;el iogurt&quot;, &quot;el iode&quot; (or dialectally &quot;lo iogurt&quot;, &quot;lo iode&quot;).

In case of apostrophization, the specific forms &quot;al&quot; (dial. &quot;as&quot;), &quot;del&quot; (dial. &quot;des&quot;), &quot;pel&quot; (dial. &quot;pes&quot;), &quot;cal&quot; (dial. &quot;cas&quot;) and &quot;can&quot; are broken and become a &quot;l&#x27;&quot; (dial. &quot;a s&#x27;&quot;), &quot;de l&#x27;&quot; (dial. &quot;de s&#x27;&quot;), &quot;per l&#x27;&quot; (dial. &quot;per s&#x27;&quot;), &quot;ca l&#x27;&quot; (dial. &quot;ca s&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;ca n&#x27;&quot; respectively.

The feminine singular article (&quot;la&quot;, &quot;na&quot; and dialectally &quot;sa&quot;) are apostrophized in the following cases: When the following word start with a vowel: &quot;l&#x27;emoció&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;ungla&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;aigua&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;Elena&quot;; when the word start with a silent &quot;h&quot;: &quot;l&#x27;heura&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;holografia&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;Hermínia&quot;, &quot;s&#x27;horabaixa&quot;. It is not apostrophized in the following cases: When it goes before word that starts with a consonantic &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (with &quot;h&quot; or not): &quot;la hiena&quot;; when it goes before a word that begins with unstressed &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (with &quot;h&quot; or not): &quot;la humitat&quot;, &quot;la universitat&quot;, &quot;la imatge&quot;; before some specific terms like &quot;la una&quot; (when referring to the time), &quot;la ira&quot;, &quot;la host&quot;, &quot;la Haia&quot; (toponym); before the name of the letters (&quot;la i&quot;, &quot;la hac&quot;, &quot;la essa&quot;); before a word that start with s followed by a consonant, &quot;la Scala de Milà&quot;.

Traditionally, to avoid ambiguities, words beginning with the negative prefix a- did not take an apostrophe. Nowadays, general apostrophized rules are followed in written text: 
&quot;l&#x27;anormalitat&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;amoralitat&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;atipicitat&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;asimetria&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;asèpsia&quot;, etc. The &quot;Diccionari de l&#x27;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot; (DIEC) of 1995 started to apply the new criteria; however, it was never formulated explicitly. In the same way, the introduction of DIEC writes about the abnormality of the situation, and the outline of the new normative grammar that prepares the IEC already does not collect that traditional exception.

;Preposition &quot;de&quot;
The preposition &quot;de&quot; takes the apostrophe before a vowel (with silent h, or without): &quot;d&#x27;aigua&quot;, &quot;d&#x27;enveja&quot;, &quot;d&#x27;humitat&quot;. It does not apostrophize however before the following cases: words that start with a consonantic &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (with silent h or without); &quot;de iode&quot;, &quot;de ioga&quot;, &quot;de uombat&quot;, &quot;de iogurt&quot;, &quot;de Utah&quot;, &quot;de ouija&quot;; before names of letters; &quot;de a&quot;, &quot;de hac&quot;. In general it does not apostrophize in case of metalanguage: &quot;el plural de alt és alts&quot;; before a liquid &quot;s&quot;: &quot;de Stalin&quot;.

;Weak pronouns
Weak pronouns take the apostrophe in the following cases:

Before a verb that starts with a vowel, using its elided form: &quot;m&#x27;agrada&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;abastava&quot;, &quot;s&#x27;estimaran&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;aconseguiria&quot;. At the end of a verb that finishes in a vowel, using the reduced form: &quot;menja&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;trenca&#x27;l&quot;, &quot;fondre&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;compra&#x27;ns&quot;. When there are two, the second if the orthographic rules allow it: &quot;me&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;li&#x27;n&quot; , &quot;se&#x27;m&quot;, &quot;te&#x27;ls&quot;, &quot;la&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;n&#x27;hi&quot;; if it is possible, it takes the apostrophe with the following word, like &quot;me n&#x27;ha dut tres&quot;. The apostrophe always goes the further to the right possible: &quot;te l&#x27;emportes&quot;, not *&quot;te&#x27;l emportes&quot;.

Does not take the apostrophe:

The pronouns &quot;us&quot;, &quot;vos&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, &quot;les&quot;: &quot;us el dono&quot; or &quot;vos el done&quot;, &quot;se us esperava&quot; or &quot;se vos esperava&quot;. Like in the case of the article, the pronoun before words that start by unstressed &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; (with silent &quot;h&quot; or without): &quot;la ignora&quot;, &quot;la hi pren&quot;, &quot;la humitejarem&quot;, &quot;la usàvem&quot;. It also does not take the apostrophe the first weak pronoun in the forms &quot;la hi&quot; and &quot;se us&quot;.

==Other conventions==
The distribution of the two rhotics {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset, an alveolar trill, {{IPA|[r]}}, appears unless preceded by a consonant; different dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring an alveolar tap, {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, and Central Catalan dialects like those of Barcelona or Girona featuring a weakly trilled {{IPA|[r]}} unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case {{IPA|[ɾ]}} appears.

In Eastern Catalan and North Western Catalan, most instances of word-final {{angbr|r}} are silent, but there are plenty of unpredictable exceptions (e.g. in Central Eastern Catalan {{Lang|ca|por}} {{IPA|[ˈpo]}} &#x27;fear&#x27; but {{Lang|ca|mar}} {{IPA|[ˈmɑɾ]}} &#x27;sea&#x27;). In Central Eastern Catalan monosyllabic words with a pronounced final {{angbr|r}} get a reinforcement final consonant {{IPA|[t]}} when in absolute final position (e.g. final {{angbr|r}} of {{Lang|ca|cor}} (&#x27;heart&#x27;) in {{Lang|ca|reina del meu cor}} {{IPA|/ˈrejnə dəl ˈmew ˈkɔrt/}} &#x27;queen of my heart&#x27; vs {{Lang|ca|el cor es mou}} {{IPA|/əl ˈkɔɾ əz ˈmɔw/}} &#x27;the heart is moving&#x27;).

In Valencian, most instances of word-final {{angbr|r}} are pronounced.

<doc id="761912" wikidata="Q668039" url="?curid=761912" title="Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)">
<text>Brave New World is the twelfth studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 29 May 2000. It was their first studio release since the return of longtime lead singer Bruce Dickinson (who left in 1993) and guitarist Adrian Smith (who left in 1990) in 1999, as well as the band&#x27;s first studio recording as a six-piece, as Janick Gers, who replaced Smith in 1990, remained with the band.

The album artwork and title song are references to the novel of the same name written by Aldous Huxley. The upper half of the artwork was created by Derek Riggs, with the bottom half by digital artist Steve Stone.

The songs &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; were both released as singles. The promotional radio release of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; featured extra vocals in the chorus not present in any other versions of the song.

The Brave New World Tour was the tour in support of the album, during which the show at Rock in Rio was recorded and later released as a live album and video.

&quot;Brave New World&quot; peaked at No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart, and has since been certified Gold. In the United States, it debuted at No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and registered over 307,000 sales on the Nielsen SoundScan system in 2008.

==Songs, composition and live performances==
Most of the songs were written before The Ed Hunter Tour and were later recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris. It was the first album the band would record with producer Kevin Shirley, and the first that they would record live in the studio.

According to an interview with Adrian Smith, &quot;The Nomad&quot;, &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot;, and &quot;The Mercenary&quot; were originally written for 1998&#x27;s &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, and former vocalist Blaze Bayley claimed to have provided some lyrics for &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot;, but was not credited. According to Steve Harris, work had also begun on &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; during that period, but it was not completed at the time.

&quot;Brave New World&quot; was the release&#x27;s only song to reappear on the Dance of Death World Tour, the next tour in support of a studio release. None of the tracks from the album were played during the A Matter of Life and Death Tour, although many returned throughout The Final Frontier World Tour, with &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; being played during the 2010 leg. &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; returned for The Book of Souls World Tour and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; also returned for the Legacy of the Beast World Tour.

The song &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, written by Steve Harris for his late father, was dedicated to Ronnie James Dio throughout the 2010 leg of The Final Frontier World Tour, following his death on 16 May. On the 2011 leg of the tour starting in Australia, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; would then be dedicated to the victims and friends and family of the band members and audience who were affected by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on 22 February. As the tour progressed, the song was also dedicated to the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, as well as the revolts in Egypt and Libya and, later, the victims of the 2011 Norway attacks. A live performance of the song from 2012&#x27;s &quot;En Vivo!&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance on 6 December 2012.

==Critical reception==
Reviews for the album were generally positive. Critics were especially warm towards the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith to the band compared to the previous two releases which featured Blaze Bayley on vocals. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described it as &quot;truly towering. Majestic. Bombastic. Titanic. So gloriously in-yer-face you can almost feel its hot breath up your nostrils.&quot; Sputnikmusic described it as &quot;one of the band&#x27;s top albums; alongside the likes of &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, and &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;&quot; and &quot;definitely the easiest album to get into since the band&#x27;s glory days.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; stated that, while &quot;it may not take too many strides forward,&quot; it &quot;certainly succeeds in reeling back the years to Iron Maiden&#x27;s heyday.&quot;

AllMusic were slightly more critical of the album, describing it as &quot;no &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;&quot;. The website went on to say that &quot;as comeback albums go, its excellence was undeniable&quot;; likewise, they gave the album a positive rating.

&quot;NME&quot; were extremely unfavourable towards the release, arguing that the band&#x27;s past &quot;dismissal of the outside world, which kept them safe all those years, now leaves them looking rather obsolete&quot;. The magazine also compared the band to more contemporary acts such as Korn and Slipknot and felt Iron Maiden were &quot;no longer the high priests of the black arts, and seem almost innocent by comparison&quot;. Blabbermouth.net were also negative, stating that the band sound &quot;tired and uninspired&quot;, and concluding that &quot;[&quot;Brave New World&quot;] will fail to leave a lasting mark on the face of the current metal scene.&quot;

In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

<text>Michele Novaro (; 23 December 1818 – 20 October 1885) was an Italian composer.

Novaro was born on 23 December 1818 in Genoa, where he studied composition and singing at the Scuola Gratuita di Canto (now the Genoa Conservatory). Novaro is mostly known as the composer of the music of the Italian national anthem, &quot;Il Canto degli Italiani&quot; (lyrics by Goffredo Mameli), better known in Italy as &quot;Inno di Mameli&quot; (Mameli&#x27;s Hymn).

Novaro was a convinced liberal and offered his compositional talents to the unification cause without deriving any personal benefits. He died poor on 20 October 1885, after a life riddled with financial and health difficulties. He was buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa.

<text>The Henry Holland Buckman Bridge carries I-295 West Beltway traffic over the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. It was named for Henry Holland Buckman, a prominent legislator and attorney who was instrumental in establishing the Florida state road system.

==History==

Before the opening of the bridge (1970), road travel across the St. Johns River from Orange Park to Mandarin was longer and more complex. One route involved driving north to downtown Jacksonville, crossing the Fuller Warren Bridge, then driving south, a distance of nearly and an hour of travel time. Another option was to drive south to Green Cove Springs and across the wooden planks of the Shands Bridge, almost twice the distance of the northern route.

The first public hearing about the bridge was held in July 1963. In April 1964, after intense discussion, the decision was made to place the bridge in Duval County, just north of the Clay County line. Construction began, but the first concrete pilings exploded days after they were poured. Investigation revealed that the heat generated from the curing concrete increased Anaerobic digestion by bacteria in the brackish water and generated methane gas. The engineers were forced to change their construction method.

==Details==

The bridge is of beam-type construction, approximately in length, and travels roughly east–west. The eastbound (carrying I-295 South traffic) and westbound (carrying I-295 North traffic) lanes are built on separate bridge structures. Average daily traffic in 1996 was estimated at 78,000 vehicles. In 1995, the bridge was expanded from two lanes in each direction with partial breakdown lanes to four lanes in each direction with full breakdown lanes. A Florida Department of Transportation study in September 1997 counted 110,743 vehicles. With busy exits within a of either end of the bridge, rush-hour backups are typical. Downtown Jacksonville and Naval Air Station Jacksonville are visible from the bridge to the north. On a clear day, the Seminole Electric power plant in Palatka can be seen to the south of the bridge.
==Closings==
While rarely closed for weather, two situations have made shutdown necessary: Tropical Storm Fay and prolonged freezing conditions. During tropical storms or hurricanes, sustained winds of over are considered hazardous and warrant closure. On December 23, 1989 the temperature dropped to 26° and precipitation changed from rain to sleet to snow, which lasted for several days. All the bridges in Jacksonville were impassable and closed for more than 24 hours, except for the original St. Elmo W. Acosta Bridge, which was first opened to traffic in 1921.

<text>Edwin Griswold Nourse (May 20, 1883 – April 7, 1974) was an American economist who served as the first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1946 to 1949. 

==Early life and education==
Nourse was born in Lockport, New York, Nourse moved to a western suburb of Chicago at the age of four months, and considered himself a Midwesterner. His father worked in the city as a supervisor of public school music. His sister, Alice Tisdale Hobart, went on to become a bestselling novelist. In high school Nourse enjoyed English and history, and after spending a year at the Louis Institute, went on to Cornell University with an interest in civil engineering. In 1903, he was caught in a wave of typhoid fever that hit campus; upon his return he decided to simply get his A.B., but also took several classes at the College of Agriculture.

==Career==
Following college, Nourse taught for two years in high school, spent a year on graduate studies, and then taught at the Wharton School, where he conceived of agricultural economics. From there he transited through the University of South Dakota, the University of Arkansas, Iowa State College, and on to the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1915 for the dissertation &quot;The Chicago Produce Market: A Study of Market Mechanism as a Factor in Price Determination&quot;. He continued to study and write about agricultural cooperation.

Nourse was a friend of Harold Moulton, the first president of the Brookings Institution, and in 1923 he convinced Nourse to come work on the agriculture side of the Institute of Economics. He remained there until 1946, moving from the head of the agriculture division to director of Institute of Economics in 1929 and then vice president in 1942.

Two years later in July he met President Harry S. Truman for the first time by way of Charles Griffith Ross to speak about becoming member of the newly created Council of Economic Advisors; Nourse subsequently resigned from Brookings to become its first chairman, with Leon Keyserling as his vice-chairman and John D. Clark as a member.

Nourse was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

== Selected publications ==

<doc id="761929" wikidata="Q215996" url="?curid=761929" title="James Francis Edward Keith">
<text>James Francis Edward Keith (in later years &quot;Jakob von Keith&quot;; 11 June 1696 – 14 October 1758) was a Scottish soldier and &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; of the Royal Prussian Army. As a Jacobite he took part in a failed attempt to restore the Stuart Monarchy to Britain. When this failed, he fled to Europe, living in France, and then Spain. He joined the Spanish and eventually the Russian armies and fought in the Anglo-Spanish War and the Russo-Swedish War. In the latter he participated in the conquest of Finland and became its viceroy. Subsequently, he participated in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that put Elizabeth of Russia on the throne.

He subsequently served in the Prussian army under Frederick the Great, where he distinguished himself in several campaigns. He died during the Seven Years&#x27; War at the Battle of Hochkirch. He received the Black Eagle Order and is memorialised on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great.

== Early life ==

Keith was born on 11 June 1696 at Inverugie Castle near Peterhead, the second son of Mary Drummond and William Keith. His father, was the 9th Earl Marischal of Scotland, was a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, and a member of the Privy Council of James Francis Edward Stuart. His mother, Mary Drummond, was daughter of James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth (1648–1716), and his first wife, Lady Jane Douglas, the fourth daughter of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas.

His parents, committed Jacobites, named him after the Great Pretender. He and his brother George (1692/93–1778) were educated by a kinsman, the historian and bishop Robert Keith. After briefly attending the University of Aberdeen, James traveled to study at the University of Edinburgh in preparation for the legal profession. Keith was a keen freemason.

== Jacobitism ==

In his autobiography, Keith makes it clear that his dissatisfaction in Great Britain began with the failure of Queen Anne to settle the Scottish succession on her half-brother James. The placement of a foreign, German family on the throne of the land led to widespread discontent in Scotland. On either 3 or 20 September 1715, he and his brother had stood side by side to proclaim James Stuart, son of the deposed King James VII and pretender to the Scottish throne, as King of Scotland.

Keith was present later that year at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 9 November. Subsequently, when the Earl of Mar failed to join up with the English Jacobites and the Catholics in the south, Keith realised that the end of this effort was near. The Jacobite effort was briefly resuscitated that year by the arrival of James himself, who landed at Peterhead at the end of December 1715, but when the Jacobites realised that James had travelled on a fishing trawler with two servants, not with an armada bringing the army the Jacobites hoped for, their morale sank even further. Eventually, after Government forces pursued the Jacobites almost to the Isle of Skye, a French Navy warship picked up 100 officers, including Keith, and took them to St. Pol de Leon in Brittany. His activities in this Jacobite rising of 1715 compelled him to remain on the Continent.
Eventually, Keith went to Paris, where he had relatives. He spent the better part of a year living hand to mouth by selling the personal items he had brought with him, mostly horse furnishings. Although he could have asked any of his relatives for assistance, but, as he explained in his unfinished memoirs, &quot;... I was then either so bashful or vain, that I wou&#x27;d [sic] not own the want I was in.&quot; Eventually he received a gift of 1000 livres from Mary of Modena, mother of the Pretender and this, plus some support from home and an allowance from James enabled him to spend the rest of the year at the university. In 1717, he received a commission as colonel of cavalry and was ordered to prepare to go to Scotland again, but the plan, contingent upon support from the Charles XII of Sweden, was discovered and thwarted, and he continued at the university. Later that year, in June, he met Peter I of Russia, and offered the Tsar his sword, being, as Keith considered it &quot;high time ... to quitte [sic] the Academy and endeavor to establish myself somewhere ...&quot; The Tsar apparently saw no need for the sword of a youth.

=== 1719 Uprising ===
When Keith was finally convinced to leave Paris (he had fallen in love), he journeyed to Spain with his brother. They had to deceive the customs agents at the borders about their destination, purpose and origins, Spain being actively engaged in trying to secure the French throne for Philip V in the War of the Quadruple Alliance. Keith and his brother journeyed to Madrid, raising funds for an army for James, arranging for its transport to Scotland, and communicating the king&#x27;s designs to the various Scottish chieftains throughout Europe. At one point in his adventures in Spain, he carried a small note from the James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde and 18,000 crowns to purchase frigates destined to carry an army to Scotland; he returned to France quietly, leaving his brother in Spain to sail with troops to the coast of Scotland. Trying to return to Paris, while in Bordeaux, he masqueraded as a friend&#x27;s servant so he could acquire some horses to get back to Paris.

In the course of communicating with Jacobite sympathizers in Spain and France, Keith realised that there was a considerable division of factions among James&#x27;s supporters. The sides all wanted Keith to communicate one thing, or another, often contradictory, to the king, all of which Keith considered favoured their private ends, not the needs of the king or the goals of the campaign. Eventually, the Jacobites embarked for the Isle of Lewis on 19 March in a small ship, from the mouth of the Seine, and set course to round the Orkney Islands The wind forced them off course until, after 24 March, they had altered course and managed to slip past a squadron of Royal Navy men-of-war which were transporting troops from Ireland to England: news of a conspiracy had reached London by then, and the Government had prepared for the uprising.

The Jacobite efforts were further complicated by bickering among the chiefs as to who should take command. Initially, this was awarded to the Marischall, Keith&#x27;s brother, but the following day, after a long speech by William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine &quot;which&quot;, Keith later wrote, &quot;no body understood but himself,&quot; Murray presented his own commission as lieutenant general, outranking the Marischall&#x27;s, whose commission of command was only as major general. There was, apparently, considerable subsequent disagreement about how the rebellion should proceed, some wishing to wait for the Duke of Ormonde&#x27;s 500 Spanish marines on the way from Spain. Knowing that the Government forces had discovered their landing place, Keith&#x27;s brother convinced Murray to disembark all the troops they had and send the Spanish ships home; the Government forces would inevitably blockade the ships in the harbor and losing the ships would endanger their relationship with Spain.

Unfortunately for the rebellion, Ormonde&#x27;s fleet had been disbanded by a storm near Galicia, and the soonest the Spanish would raise another one would be the following spring. Time to mount any rebellion was running short. The Jacobites were poorly armed and even more poorly provisioned and the Government force was three days march away. The nearby clans made an effort to raise additional troops, but gathered only about 1,000. The Government forces approached with four regiments of foot and a detachment of a fifth regiment, plus 150 dragoons. The Jacobite position was secure enough, but on 10 June, the Government force came out of the mountains and attacked; in short order, the Royal Navy captured Eilean Donan Castle and, at the Battle of Glen Shiel, the Government forces defeated the small Jacobite army. The Jacobites decided that they should disperse and the Spaniards surrender.

Keith spent several months lurking in the mountains and, in early September, embarked for Holland from Peterhead. Upon trying to cross France to reach Spain, the brothers were arrested at Sedan, and ordered to prison. Keith had in his pocket a pair of commissions from the King of Spain, items which would cause them great trouble, but his jailers did not search him, nor ask for his name. For safety, &quot;pretending a certain necessity, [he] threw them in to a place needless to be named.&quot;

== Spanish service ==
After leaving France, Keith eventually obtained a colonelcy in the Spanish army as part of the Irish Brigade, then commanded by the Duke of Ormonde. He then fought in the failed Siege of Gibraltar.

Finding his Protestantism a barrier to promotion in Catholic Spain, he obtained a recommendation from the King of Spain to Peter II of Russia.

== Imperial Russian service ==
In Imperial Russian service, Keith was initially assigned to command two regiments of foot belonging to Vasily Vladimirovich Dolgorukov&#x27;s brigade, he asked for a delay of three months in which he could learn the language and practices of the Russian service. He took the time not only to learn the language, but also to learn the Court and its intricate politics. His first mentor there, James Fitz-James Stuart, 2nd Duke of Berwick and Duke of Liria, fell into a quarrel with both Dolgorukov and Count Matueof.

His commander there, Peter Lacy, had fled Ireland after the Williamite War. He was also one of the first Freemasons active in Russia, as a master of a lodge in Saint Petersburg in 1732–34. He also participated in Elizabeth of Russia&#x27;s seizure of power in Petersburg. He received the Imperial Order of St Andrew.

During the Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743, Keith was briefly &quot;de facto&quot; Vice-Roy of Finland and responsible for the occupying Russian forces, James Keith convened the estates of southwestern Finland on 8 (or 18) September. He proved adept as a capable and liberal civil administrator. In late 1742, Keith was succeeded in the leadership of civil administration of Finland (now based at Turku) by the new Governor-General, Johannes Balthasar von Campenhausen.

== Prussian service ==

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Keith held high command in the Prussian army. In 1756, he commanded the troops covering the investment of Pirna, and distinguished himself at Lobositz. The battle at Lobositz was a particularly difficult situation. Frederick, in what was his typical manner, dismissed Austrian capability; he sent his columns directly into a valley surrounded by Croatian sharpshooters.

The failure of his troops to make any headway against Lacy&#x27;s troops, and indeed their apparent collapse, caused Frederick to feel the battle lost, and to leave the field. Upon his departure, command devolved to Keith. Initially Keith made no headway against the Austrian front, but when Lacy was wounded, his subordinates did not have the same command vision, and Keith was able to make some progress against the Austrian front, actually rolling up the Austrian lines to the north and south of Lobositz. The overall Austrian commander, George Browne, had never intended to make this a major battle, and so withdrew the entire force to Budin, approximately away.

In 1757, he commanded at the siege of Prague and later, in this same campaign, he defended Leipzig against a greatly superior force. He was also present at Rossbach, and, while the king was fighting at Leuthen, joined with Prince Henry&#x27;s force in Saxony.

=== Hochkirch ===
In 1758, Keith took a prominent part in the Moravian campaign, after which he withdrew from the army to restore his broken health. He returned in time for the autumn campaign in the Lausitz region, and was killed on 14 October 1758 at the battle of Hochkirch. He had been shot several times; the final shot knocked him off his horse into his groom&#x27;s arms. The groom was dragged away, leaving Keith&#x27;s body behind.

Although stripped bare by the time the Austrians found him on the battlefield the following day, he was recognised by Lacy, the son of Peter Lacy, his old commander in Russia. The Austrians gave him a decent burial on the field; his groom, who had crept back to the battlefield, observed this and marked the location. Keith was transferred shortly afterwards by Frederick to the garrison church of Berlin.

=== Relationship with Frederick ===

While at the University of Edinburgh, James Keith acquired a taste for literature and learning that secured him the esteem of the most distinguished savants of Europe. His experiences in the Jacobite uprisings, and his observations of the contentious competition between and among the clan chieftains, offered him the opportunity early to learn the pitfalls of command, the arts of negotiation, and the importance of listening and diplomacy. This skill was further sharped during the intrigues of the Russian court, where he served for 17 years. He displayed in numerous campaigns the calm, intelligent and watchful valour which was his chief characteristic.

In his personal relationships, he demonstrated calmness and loyalty. In this he was the opposite of his father, who had been described as &quot;very wild, inconstant and passionate.&quot; In Finland, he met Eva Merthen. Although they never married, they had several children.

Keith became one of Frederick&#x27;s chief allies and friends. Keith developed a game of chess for Frederick, life-sized, that the two would play; Frederick also travelled &quot;incognito&quot; with Keith throughout Germany and Hungary.

At his final battle, he had remonstrated with the king about establishing the camp at Hochkirch, with the Austrians looming in the heights around them, pointing out that staying in the village was suicide. &quot;If the Austrians leave us unmolested in this camp&quot;, Keith told the king, &quot;they deserve to be hanged.&quot; Frederick reportedly replied, &quot;it is to be hoped they are more afraid of us than of the gallows.&quot; Frederick was devastated by Keith&#x27;s death at Hochkirch.

== Memorials ==

Many memorials were erected to him by the king, Prince Henry, and others. 
He was immortalised in song as Feldmarschall von Keith in the ballad &quot;Fridericus Rex&quot; by Willibald Alexis, which was set to music by Carl Loewe in 1837 and became the basis in the 1860s for Ferdinand Radek&#x27;s Fridericus Rex Grenadier March in which his surname is mispronounced as &quot;Kite.&quot;
He is memorialised on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great (1851). 
In 1889, the 22nd Infantry Regiment (1st Upper Silesian) was named after him. Hochkirch erected a stone tablet inscribed to Keith outside its church, to stand with others dedicated to the victims of Prussia&#x27;s defeat by Austria on 14 October 1758. 
There is also a statue to Keith in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, which was given to the town by William I, King of Prussia, in 1868.

<doc id="761930" wikidata="Q3082598" url="?curid=761930" title="Frank Erwin Center">
<text>The Frank C. Erwin Jr. Center (originally Special Events Center) was a multi-purpose arena located on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas. It was also sometimes referred to as &quot;The Drum&quot; or &quot;The Superdrum&quot;, owing to its round, drum-like appearance from outside (not to be confused with Big Bertha, the large bass drum used by the University of Texas marching band).

The multi-purpose facility hosted entertainment events and was the home court for the Texas Longhorns men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball programs until 2022, when it was replaced by the Moody Center. The Erwin Center was located at the southeastern corner of the UT central campus and was bounded on the east by Interstate 35.

==History==

Built to replace Gregory Gymnasium as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams&#x27; home arena, the Special Events Center was completed in 1977 for a total cost of $34 million. The Texas men&#x27;s basketball team opened the events center on November 29, 1977, with an 83–76 victory over the Oklahoma Sooners. UT undertook extensive renovations of the facility from 2001 to 2003 at a cost of $55 million, adding, among other things, new and renovated seating, new video and sound systems, new lighting, and 28 suites.

The building was named for former UT Board of Regents member Frank Erwin, who as a regent was very controversial due to his hostility towards the burgeoning on-campus, political counterculture movement of the late 1960s and was directly involved in the arrest of protesting students and the purging of what he deemed as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; faculty. Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1980 to honor Erwin, who died that same year.

A two-level layout (the lower &quot;arena&quot; and upper &quot;mezzanine&quot;) accommodated up to 16,540 spectators for basketball games and up to 17,900 spectators for concerts. The inner ring of the arena averaged around 20 rows deep, while the mezzanine is slightly deeper at around 24 rows. The size of the arena&#x27;s inner ring was highly dependent on the event being hosted.

=== Replacement and demolition ===

In 2013, the Dell Medical Center, a $334 million teaching hospital for the university, identified the Erwin Center parking lot and the Waller Creek area directly across from the Center as being the site of Phase I of the Dell Center&#x27;s construction, with the completion of following phases to require the demolition of the Erwin Center.

In 2018, the University of Texas and the Oak View Group announced that they had agreed to build a new arena for the Texas Longhorns basketball programs, at a cost of $338 million; the new facility would fill the role that had been played by the Frank Erwin Center. The new arena is the Moody Center, named after the Moody Foundation, which had donated $130 million to University of Texas athletic programs. A groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of Moody Arena was held on the UT campus, just south of Mike A. Myers Soccer Stadium, on December 3, 2019; the new arena was completed in 2022. The Erwin Center hosted its last ticketed event on April 2, 2022; it was a basketball game which featured the Harlem Globetrotters. The newly completed Moody Center opened on April 20, 2022. The final UT graduation ceremonies to take place at the Erwin Center were held on May 20–21, 2022; they were the Erwin Center&#x27;s last scheduled events.

A year after the closure of the Erwin Center, the UT System Board of Regents unveiled plans for the structure&#x27;s demolition. The announcement was made on May 1, 2023, and the demolition process began during the following November. The Erwin Center was dismantled in phases, to preserve nearby structures and to facilitate the recycling of materials. The last remaining building supports came down on May 19, 2024, officially marking the end of the Erwin Center with the land to be cleared out completely by September.

==Events==

Located adjacent to downtown Austin, The Erwin Center was generally accepted to be Austin&#x27;s current premier venue for large public and private events. The center held many events such as concerts, professional wrestling events, bull riding and private banquets.

The arena has hosted three UFC mixed martial events: UFC Fight Night: Marquardt vs. Palhares in 2010, UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Swanson in 2014, and UFC Fight Night: Cowboy vs. Medeiros in 2018. Legendary professional boxer Miguel Cotto of Puerto Rico had his debut fight there, knocking out Jason Doucet in the first round of a boxing show headlined by a fight between Mexican Jesus Chavez and American Tom Johnson, contest won by Chavez by an eighth-round knockout on February 23, 2001.

Music artists such as Taylor Swift, David Bowie, Tina Turner, Lana Del Rey, Ariana Grande, KISS, U2, Bon Jovi, Pearl Jam, Paul McCartney, Def Leppard, George Strait, Garth Brooks, Van Halen, Rush, AC/DC, Pink Floyd, 
Prince, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Rod Stewart, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Radiohead, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus and many others have performed at the arena.

The Erwin Center hosted the semifinals and finals of the University Interscholastic League boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball playoffs in all five classifications until 2015, when the playoffs moved to San Antonio.

The arena also hosted both UT commencement ceremonies and various local high school graduations.

<text>Hédi Amara Nouira (5 April 1911 – 25 January 1993) was a Tunisian politician. He served as the 2nd Prime Minister of Tunisia between 1970 and 1980.

==Biography==
Hédi Nouira was born in Monastir and trained as a lawyer. He served as one of the founders of the Neo-Destour party and was a colleague of Habib Bourguiba. He was imprisoned for anti-colonial activities by the French from 1938 to 1943, but later represented the Neo-Destour during negotiations with France towards Tunisian independence in 1950.

Following independence in 1956, Nouira was appointed as finance minister and was later appointed the governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia in 1958. Following the failure of a short-lived Socialist experiment in the 1960s, Nouira liberalised the economy during the 1970s. In 1970, the then governor of the Central Bank, Nouira was appointed prime minister. The most decisive factor in Nouira&#x27;s appointment seemed to be his commitment to private initiative as well as his financier&#x27;s background. 

Having been named as President Bourguiba&#x27;s successor in 1974, Nouira&#x27;s tenure as prime minister saw him increasingly take the roles of the former, who was suffering from ill health. At the same time, he was criticised by workers and dissidents for his harsh stances on labor and opposition to multiparty politics.

He retired from politics in 1980 after suffering a stroke. Nouira died on 25 January 1993, after suffering from an undisclosed illness.

==Family==
His younger brother, Habib Nouira, served as Tunisian Ambassador to Iraq, Kuwait, Syria and Egypt.

<text>Gustav Noske (9 July 1868 – 30 November 1946) was a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He served as the first Minister of Defence (&quot;Reichswehrminister&quot;) of the Weimar Republic between 1919 and 1920. Noske was known for using army and paramilitary forces to suppress the socialist/communist uprisings of 1919.

==Early life==
Noske was born on 9 July 1868 in Brandenburg an der Havel, Prussia. He was the son of the weaver Karl Noske (born 1838) and the manual labourer Emma Noske (née Herwig, born 1843). From 1874 to 1882, he went to primary and secondary school (&quot;Volks-&quot; and &quot;Bürgerschule&quot;). In 1882 to 1886 he was apprenticed as a basket maker at the &quot;Reichsteinische Kinderwagenfabrik&quot; and travelled to Halle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Liegnitz as a journeyman. In 1884, Noske joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and he also became a union member. In 1892, Noske was elected chairman of the Brandenburg SPD. He married Martha Thiel (1872–1949) at Brandenburg in 1891. They had one son and two daughters.

From 1897 to 1902, Noske was politically active at the local level and worked as an editor at social democratic newspapers in Brandenburg and Königsberg (&quot;Volkstribüne&quot;). From 1902 to 1918 he was chief editor at the paper &quot;Volksstimme&quot; in Chemnitz. In the 1907 German federal election, Noske was elected to the Reichstag of the German Empire for the SPD where he remained through 1918 as representative of the Chemnitz Reichstag constituency.

Within the SPD he was an expert on military, navy and colonial issues. After 1912, Noske was the Reichstag&#x27;s co-spokesman for the Navy budget. In 1914, he published a book &quot;Kolonialpolitik und Sozialdemokratie&quot; in which he argued in favour of German colonialism. He was known as a reformist, one of those in the SPD who wanted to achieve their political goals within the existing system, and as someone who was not much interested in fundamental theoretical debates.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Noske was part of the centre of the SPD, which also included Friedrich Ebert and Philipp Scheidemann, and supported the war as a defensive measure. Noske supported the war loans, but he also argued in favour of a stronger political position for the Reichstag. In 1916 to 1918, he was the parliamentary speaker of a commission appointed by the government to investigate military procurement and related excess profits by contractors (&quot;Kommission für die Überprüfung der Kriegslieferungen&quot;). In that function, Noske helped to shed light on the business practices involved and to expand the authority of the parliament.

==German Revolution and civil war==

In October 1918, Noske became a member of the leadership of the SPD Reichstag group. When the Kiel mutiny started in early November, Prince Max von Baden, the new chancellor, sent Noske to Kiel to negotiate an end to the revolt. The mutineers welcomed Noske and elected him as Chairman of the Soldiers&#x27; Council, as they considered him—a Social Democrat—to be on their side. Within days he had succeeded in restoring the authority of the officers and in making the mutineers who had remained in Kiel resume their normal duties. Max von Baden and his successor as chancellor, Friedrich Ebert, who was a close personal friend of Noske&#x27;s, were pleased with Noske&#x27;s achievement. Noske remained in Kiel until December 1918.

As a result of the government&#x27;s violent response to the revolt by the sailors of the &quot;Volksmarinedivision&quot; just before Christmas 1918, the representatives of the Independent Social Democrats (USPD) left the revolutionary government of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies (&quot;Rat der Volksbeauftragten&quot;) at the end of the month, and Noske was one of two Majority Social Democrats who took their place on 30 December. Within the government Noske was responsible for military affairs.

On 5 January 1919, the USPD and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) called for demonstrations to protest the dismissal of the head of the Berlin police, a USPD member, for supporting the sailors&#x27; revolt the preceding Christmas. The demonstration grew into the Spartacist uprising, which had the goal of replacing the national government with a council republic. After the insurgents seized Berlin&#x27;s city centre and the newspaper district, Ebert attempted to negotiate with them. When the discussions broke down, his major concern was with maintaining internal peace. He ordered the rebellion quashed, and Noske, who was in charge of the Army and Navy, used both regular forces and Freikorps units to end the uprising. Around 165 people lost their lives.

A few days later, on 15 January 1919, members of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; &quot;Garde-Kavallerie-Schützendivision&quot; led by Captain Waldemar Pabst abducted and murdered the co-leaders of the KPD, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Previously, Noske had personally ordered that Liebknecht&#x27;s telephone line be monitored and Liebknecht&#x27;s every movement be reported to Pabst.

On 19 January 1919 elections to the &quot;Nationalversammlung&quot; (national assembly) were held. It met in Weimar and on 13 February 1919 the newly elected president Ebert appointed a new government, led by Philipp Scheidemann. Noske became &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot; (defence minister).

Over the first half of 1919 Ebert and Noske repeated what they had done in Berlin throughout the Reich. Left-wing uprisings were crushed by brutal military force, employing both regular army and paramilitary Freikorps.

As &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot; in the governments of Philipp Scheidemann and Gustav Bauer, who succeeded Scheidemann as chancellor in June 1919, Noske oversaw the initial reorganisation of the military after the collapse of 1918. Despite substantial misgivings, he ultimately supported signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which severely curtailed the ability of Germany to maintain an effective military. Beginning in the summer of 1919, there were plots by the Reichswehr leadership to seize power in a military coup. Noske was drawn into these discussions. Although he refused offers to serve as a dictator after a putsch, he never took any steps against the officers who made these offers and failed to report their activities to his fellow members of government.

On 20 January 1920, the Treaty of Versailles came into force, restricting the German army to 100,000 men or less. On 28 February 1920 Noske, following orders of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control, which oversaw Germany&#x27;s compliance with the Treaty, dissolved the Freikorps &quot;Marinebrigaden&quot; &quot;Ehrhardt&quot; and &quot;Loewenfeld&quot;. The highest ranking general of the Reichswehr, Walther von Lüttwitz, refused to comply, resulting in what became known as the Kapp Putsch.

To restore order, Noske asked the chief of the &quot;Truppenamt in the Reichswehr Ministry&quot;, General Hans von Seeckt, to order the regular army to put down the putsch. Von Seeckt refused and the government was forced to flee from Berlin. However, a general strike called by the unions, the Social Democrats and the government, as well as the refusal of the bureaucracy to recognise the new (self-declared) chancellor Wolfgang Kapp, resulted in a quick collapse of the coup.

As one of the conditions for ending the general strike, the unions demanded the resignation of Noske as &quot;Reichswehrminister&quot;. Moreover, some within the SPD were unhappy with his conduct during the crisis and deemed him to have been lacking in energy dealing with the putsch. He resigned on 22 March 1920. Otto Gessler of the German Democratic Party succeeded him. Noske would be the last Social Democrat in this position during the Weimar Republic.

==Later career and death==
Noske was Governor (&quot;Oberpräsident&quot;) of the Province of Hanover from 1920 on. He became more conservative and supported Paul von Hindenburg in the elections for Reichspräsident in 1925 and 1932. Since he was a Social Democrat, the Nazi government relieved him of his duties in the spring of 1933 and then dismissed him on 1 October. Noske then moved to Frankfurt. On 22 July 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo under suspicion of involvement in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler and imprisoned in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. He spent seven months in the camps before being transferred to a regular prison. Noske was freed by advancing Allied troops from a Gestapo prison in Berlin on 22 April 1945.

He died in Hanover on 30 November 1946 from a stroke while preparing for a lecture tour of the United States. He is buried at &quot;Stadtfriedhof Engesohde&quot; in Hanover.

==Reception==
Noske has been called &quot;one of the most forceful and at the same time controversial personalities of his time&quot;. For some, Noske had the courage to be (in his own words) &quot;the bloodhound&quot; and prevent Germany from falling into chaos and then tyranny of the type previously experienced by Russia after the Bolshevik October Revolution. Other historians have called him &quot;a primitive brute, who conducted policy according to a simple friend-foe-pattern&quot; and someone who was &quot;unable to differentiate, who was in love with violence, who from his whole mentality would have fitted better into the NSDAP than into the SPD&quot;.

<text>Peter Buchan (4 August 1790 – 19 September 1854) was a Scottish editor, publisher, and collector of ballads and folktales.

==Biography==
Born in Peterhead, Buchan apprenticed with a , and in 1814 produced his first book, a collection of verse which failed to be taken notice of. As his hometown lacked any printer shops, in 1816 Buchan went to Stirling to learn the printing process, becoming proficient enough to produce samples within a matter of ten days.

He established business as a printer in Peterhead in March 1816, with the support of the Earl of Buchan who recommended a friend to fund the purchase of the press.

In the early years of business, he printed a series of chapbooks. He also invented his own printing press named the &quot;Auchmedden&quot;, a pedal-operated devise that accepted stone, copper, as well as type surfaces for printing. He operated the press from a building on Peterhead&#x27;s Longate. His &quot;The Annals of Peterhead&quot; (1819) had copper-plate illustrations which he himself engraved. &quot;Scarce Ancient Ballads&quot; (1819), &quot;Gleanings of Scarce Old Ballads&quot; (1825) were early publications that foreshadowed what would be his lifelong interest. 
After this, he held a position in London from which drew a £150 annual income, but having compromised his health, he retired to Peterhead and devoted himself to the collection of Scottish ballads from oral sources, and their publication. His &quot;Ancient Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland&quot; (1828) contained a large number of hitherto unpublished ballads, and newly discovered versions of existing ones.

== Works ==
Another collection made by him was published by the Percy Society, under the title &quot;Scottish Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads&quot; (1845). Two unpublished volumes of Buchan&#x27;s ballad collections are in the British Museum.

Buchan also compiled a collection of folktales, and his manuscripts were known to John Francis Campbell who discussed them in his &quot;Popular Tales of the West Highlands&quot;. Buchan&#x27;s folktales were later published as &quot;Ancient Scottish Tales&quot; (1908).

==Animal rights==

Buchan was an early animal rights writer. In 1824, he authored a book that argued that animals have souls and are immortal. Buchan argued that God must recompense the &quot;undeserved pain&quot; of animals by appointing them a &quot;future state&quot;.

<text>John Godfrey Knauff (January 5, 1879 – September 1, 1959), known professionally as Jack Norworth, was an American songwriter, singer and vaudeville performer.

==Biography==
Norworth is credited as writer of a number of Tin Pan Alley hits. He wrote the lyrics to &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; in 1908, his longest-lasting hit. It wasn&#x27;t until 1940 that he witnessed a major league baseball game. The song placed at number 8 on the &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; list selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America.

His &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; was a bigger hit at the time. There is some disagreement about his involvement in its creation. Broadway historian John Kenrick credits Edward Madden and Gus Edwards, while the family of Follies songwriter Dave Stamper claims he wrote the song while working as the pianist for Nora Bayes, the officially credited co-writer with Norworth. Another possibility for the music could lie with George Gershwin, who was also a piano player for this vaudeville troupe. Albert Koch, of Wisconsin, also an accomplished songwriter, claims to have written the song himself, and sold it outright for $50, forfeiting the rights to the song.

Other popular songs credited to Norworth include &quot;Back to My Old Home Town&quot;; &quot;Come Along, My Mandy&quot;; &quot;Dear Dolly&quot;; &quot;Good Evening, Caroline&quot;; &quot;Holding Hands&quot;; &quot;Honey Boy&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Boy/I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Girl&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m Married&quot;; &quot;Kitty&quot;; &quot;Meet Me in Apple Blossom Time&quot;; &quot;Over on the Jersey Side&quot;; &quot;Since My Mother Was a Girl&quot;; &quot;Sing an Irish Song&quot; and &quot;Smarty.&quot; &quot;Turn Off Your Light, Mr. Moon Man&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Shine on, Harvest Moon.&quot;

Born John Godfrey Knauff in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Theodore Christian Knauff and Louise H. (Pearson) Knauff, he changed his name to Jack Norworth when he went into show business. His father was an organ builder and also a choir director at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The theater was not a reputable career in that time especially coming from a religious family. Following a few years at sea, he landed in New York City at age 20 to embark on a show business career. In 1908, he married Nora Bayes, with whom he performed in vaudeville; the couple divorced in 1913. Following the Ziegfeld Follies (1909), Norworth appeared in a number of Broadway theater productions and was heard on early radio, such as his March 1928 guest appearance on &quot;Acousticon Hour&quot;. He also appeared April, 13, 1958 on the Ed Sullivan Show to sing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; along with four players (Ford, Berra, Mantle, Skowron) from the New York Yankees.

Before Bayes, he had been married to actress Louise Dresser. He appeared in early sound films with his third wife, Dorothy Adelphi. His last film role came as a doctor in &quot;The Southerner&quot; (1945) under the direction of Jean Renoir. He was portrayed by Dennis Morgan in the 1944 musical film &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; (in which Ann Sheridan played Bayes as the love of Norworth&#x27;s life) and by Ron Husmann in the 1978 Ziegfeld biopic &quot;Ziegfeld: The Man &amp; His Women&quot;. He is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Jack Norworth died of a heart attack in Laguna Beach, California in 1959 and was interred at Melrose Abbey Memorial Park in Anaheim, California, just across I-5 from the Los Angeles Angels ballpark. 

On July 11, 2010, a black granite monument, paid for by concerned fans, was installed about 100 feet from Jack&#x27;s actual headstone.

<text>Journey into Mystery is an American comic book series initially published by Atlas Comics, then by its successor, Marvel Comics. Initially a horror comics anthology, it changed to giant-monster and science fiction stories in the late 1950s. Beginning with issue #83 (cover dated Aug. 1962), it ran the superhero feature &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;, created by writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and artist Jack Kirby, and inspired by the mythological Norse thunder god. The series, which was renamed for its superhero star with issue #126 (March 1966), has been revived three times: in the 1970s as a horror anthology, and in the 1990s and 2010s with characters from Marvel&#x27;s Thor mythos. The title was also used in 2019 for a limited series as part of the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline.

== Publication history ==
=== 1950s–1960s ===
The first &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; series was initially a horror-fantasy anthology published by Marvel Comics&#x27; 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics, with a first issue cover-dated June 1952. Artist Joe Kubert, who would later become one of the main war comics artists for DC Comics, drew the story &quot;The Hog&quot; in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #21 (January 1955). Issue #23 was the first to be approved by the Comics Code Authority, which led to restrictions on horror comics. The title was caught in the collapse of Atlas&#x27; distributor, and publication was suspended for a year between issues #48 (Aug. 1957) and #49 (Nov. 1958). Xemnu, a huge, furry alien monster, first appeared in &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot; #62 (Nov. 1960). The character reappeared in issue #66 (March 1961). Since then the character has been a mainstay in the Marvel Universe, and was renamed Xemnu the Titan. &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #69 and the teen-humor title &quot;Patsy Walker&quot; #95 (both June 1961) are the first modern comic books labeled &quot;Marvel Comics&quot;, with each showing an &quot;MC&quot; box on its cover.
Beginning with issue #83 (Aug. 1962), the title introduced the Norse god superhero Thor. The anthological stories, by now primarily science fiction-fantasy, gradually diminished after this, with the Thor-spinoff backup feature &quot;Tales of Asgard&quot; beginning in issue #97 (Oct. 1963). They were dropped entirely with issue #105 (June 1964), when the &quot;Thor&quot; feature expanded from 13 to 18 pages. With the previous issue, the cover logo had changed to &quot;Journey into Mystery with the Mighty Thor&quot;. Its final issue was #125 (Feb. 1966), after which the series was retitled &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; in its trademarked cover logo and simply &quot;Thor&quot; in its postal indicia copyright notice. Thor&#x27;s evil adoptive brother Loki was introduced in issue #85 (October 1962). Other adversaries for the new hero included the Radioactive Man introduced in #93 (June 1963), the Enchantress and the Executioner in #104 (April 1964), the Absorbing Man in #114 (March 1965), and the Destroyer in #118 (July 1965). An oversized annual publication, featuring Thor, was released in 1965 and introduced the Marvel version of the Greco-Roman demigod Hercules. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;the adventures of Thor were gradually transformed from stories about a strange-looking superhero into a spectacular saga.&quot;

=== Volume 2 (1970s) ===
A second &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; ran 19 issues (October 1972 – October 1975). The title was one of four launched by Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas to form a line of science fiction and horror anthologies with more thematic cohesion than the company&#x27;s earlier attempts that decade, which had included the series &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot;. Whereas those titles generally presented original stories, these new books would instead adapt genre classics and other stories. With the four titles&#x27; debuts set to be staggered over the course of four months, Marvel premiered &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; vol. 2 (October 1972), &quot;Chamber of Chills&quot; (Nov. 1972), &quot;Supernatural Thrillers&quot; (Dec. 1972), and, with a late start, &quot;Worlds Unknown&quot; (May 1973).

The first five issues of &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; vol. 2 featured such adaptations as Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Dig Me No Grave&quot;, by writer Thomas and penciler Gil Kane, in issue #1; Robert Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; by Thomas and Ron Goulart and penciler Kane, in #2; and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; by Goulart and penciler Gene Colan, in addition to anthological horror stories by writers including George Alec Effinger, Steve Gerber, Steve Englehart, and Steve Skeates, and pencilers such as Billy Graham, Jim Starlin, Ralph Reese, and P. Craig Russell. Most issues also included a reprinted story from Marvel&#x27;s 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. By issue #6, however, the magazine became a reprint title featuring science-fiction and giant-monster tales from the first &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; series, as well as from the &quot;pre-superhero Marvel&quot; anthologies &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Strange Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;.

=== 1990s series ===
As a consequence of the company-wide crossover &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;, Thor ceased to be the focus of his own series, which was restored to &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; beginning with issue #503 (Nov. 1996). The feature &quot;The Lost Gods&quot; ran through issue #513, followed by issues starring Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu and the Black Widow for three issues each, and reluctant vampire Hannibal King for two, ending with issue #521 (June 1998).

=== 2010s series ===
The &quot;Thor&quot; title resumed its original numbering in 2009 with &quot;Thor&quot; #600, including the intervening issues of &quot;Thor&quot; in its count while disregarding the 1990s &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot; issues. Starting with issue #622, the series for a second time had its title restored to &quot;Journey Into Mystery&quot;, which accompanied the launch of a new title, &quot;Mighty Thor.&quot; Thor&#x27;s supporting cast returned as the focus of a run written by Kieron Gillen, who had written &quot;Thor&quot; from #604 to #614, and drawn by Doug Braithwaite. Starring was the Thor antagonist Loki, who had been reincarnated as a child following his sacrifice in the series &quot;Siege&quot;. Gillen&#x27;s run was favorably reviewed, with one critic writing:

In Gillen&#x27;s final issue, a letter from Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was published, in which he praised Gillen for his take on the character.

With issue #646, the focus of &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; changed with its rebranding under the Marvel NOW! imprint. Written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Valerio Schiti, the series began starring the Marvel Asgardians, with the Lady Sif as its lead character. The series was cancelled with issue #655 (Oct. 2013).

=== War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery ===
During the &quot;War of the Realms&quot; storyline in 2019, the title was used for a limited five–issue run written by Griffin, Justin, Travis and Clint McElroy. The series was drawn by André Lima Araújo with covers from Valerio Schiti. In the limited series, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Wonder Man, Sebastian Druid, Death Locket, Thori the Hellhound, and Balder the Brave go on a quest to save the Earth. In 2023, the McElroys continued the storyline in the &quot;Outre Space&quot; arc of their tabletop role playing podcast, &quot;The Adventure Zone&quot;, using the Marvel Multiverse rules set.

<doc id="761941" wikidata="Q6608767" url="?curid=761941" title="List of candidates in the 2004 United States presidential election">
<text>The following are lists of candidates in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]]. Candidates who were not on any state ballots, withdrew from the race, suspended their presidential campaign, or failed to earn their party&#x27;s nomination are listed separately.

==Party nominees==
All candidates in the table below were on the ballot in multiple states. Those who were on the ballot in enough states to win a majority in the U.S. Electoral College are marked in bold. Candidates who were on the ballot in no more than one state are listed in the next section.

==Ballot access==
The two major parties in the United States are the Democratic and the Republican parties, which are on the ballot in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.

The table below shows which third-party candidates were able to gain ballot access in each state. In some states, these candidates were on the ballot as independents, or on the ballot lines of different parties (for example, in Michigan the Socialist Party USA candidate received the Natural Law Party&#x27;s ballot line.)

The Socialist Workers Party&#x27;s official ticket could not be listed on the ballot in some states because Calero and Hawkins were both ineligible to be president, as Calero was not a native-born citizen and Hawkins was too young. In such states the party used their 2000 ticket of James Harris and Margaret Trowe (JH).

The Prohibition Party suffered a schism in 2003. Long-time presidential candidate Earl Dodge was the nominee of one faction, while Gene Amondson was the nominee of the other. Both factions were on the ballot in Colorado, with only Amondson on the ballot in Louisiana.

;Candidates who had enough potential electoral votes to win the presidency
;Other third-party candidates
;Other candidates
The tickets below were on the ballot in no more than one state. Those who appeared on a single state&#x27;s ballot are in bold, all others were write-in candidates. Those without party labels were independents. Some did not have vice-presidential candidates.

<text>Forest is a community in Lambton Shores, Ontario, Canada, near Sarnia and Lake Huron in Lambton County. It has a population of 2,876 (2011 Census) and a land area of .

== Community ==
Forest&#x27;s high school is North Lambton Secondary School. This facility includes a large gymnasium and cafeteria, as well as meal preparation facilities. The community also has elementary schools in both the public (Kinnwood Central Public School) and catholic (St. John Fisher) school systems.

Recreational facilities include an enclosed arena for hockey or ringette, a community centre for dances held by the town with baseball and soccer fields, a lawn bowling club, public tennis courts, splash pad and an agricultural society with grounds used for a fall fair and occasional campsites. There are a dozen golf courses within a 20-mile drive.

Forest Amphitheatre is a natural amphitheatre located at the conservation area (Esli Dodge Conservation Area) in the south part of the town. The stage is situated on a small island, and spectators sit on the surrounding hillsides on lawn chairs or blankets. Hundreds attend outdoor performances there each summer. An annual performance of a religious play (&quot;The Promise&quot;), acted in by members of the town, was held annually from 1995 to 2005. Since 2007 country music concerts entitled &quot;Music In the Valley&quot; have been held there.

The Forest Museum is located in the old Forest Home Bakery building at 8 Main St. N. This building dates to the 1880s. Permanent display themes include the bakery, First Nations, agriculture, the railway, the military, the Forest Excelsior Band, local doctors, fashion, toys, Peoples Telephone, area businesses, churches and schools. The museum was founded in 1963 by the Forest-Lambton Museum Society. In 2019, museum volunteers discovered 100 year old silent movie era posters hidden away in an old storage shed on the property. The posters were likely kept in the shed because the bakery was once owned by the Rumford family, founders of the Kineto Theatre. Two of the recovered posters has been cleaned up and are on display at the museum. A third is on display at the Kineto.

The Kineto Theatre is one of the world&#x27;s oldest movie theatres, having been in operation since 1917. Owned and operated by the Kiwanis Club of Forest, it features a concession booth and seats up to 225 people, and is open every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday.

== History ==
Forest is situated on what was once dense forest. When the Grand Trunk Railway was built through where the town now sits, the station was named for the dense forest. Hickory Creek, which meanders through the town, provided water for the station in those days when wood and water were essential to the operation of steam locomotives.

The first post office, in 1859, was then named Forest. The site was very near the junction of three township boundaries, with parts of Warwick, Plympton and Bosanquet townships all annexed into the town. None of these townships remain as political units due to amalgamation, with Bosanquet joining Forest in forming Lambton Shores (along with the villages of Arkona, Thedford, and Grand Bend).

The industry of the town was initially tied to the abundant fruit growing operation. There were once a canning factory and a basket factory in Forest. In more recent years the town has become a dormitory community for the city of Sarnia (and to a lesser extent London, Ontario). The extensive tourism area along the shores of nearby Lake Huron also supports several businesses. Several small factories supporting the auto industry have also opened in the past few years.

The once Forest Carnegie Library has its historical plaque posted on the outside pillar and is now operating as an event centre where one can rent the space and hold private social events. There is a meeting space, music area, as well as a long missed billiards table - as seen on the website https://library-events.com.

<text>Thomas Norton (153210 March 1584) was an English lawyer, politician, writer of verse, and playwright.

==Official career==
Norton was born in London, the son of Thomas Norton and the former Elizabeth Merry. He was educated at Cambridge. He became a secretary to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. In 1555 he was admitted as a student at the Inner Temple. He married Margery Cranmer, the daughter of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and his wife Margarete, with whom he had no children. Margery died before 1568. In 1568, Thomas married Alice Cranmer, the daughter of Archdeacon Edmund Cranmer, the brother of the Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he did have issue.

Norton served in Parliament as the representative of Gatton. In 1562 he became M.P. for Berwick, and was active in politics. He became the unofficial leader of a group of about fifty members of the House of Commons, which G. R. Elton saw as the first semi-official opposition in Parliament. He was inspired by the religious views of his father-in-law, and was in possession of Cranmer&#x27;s manuscript code of ecclesiastical law; this he permitted John Foxe to publish in 1571. He went to Rome on legal business, in 1579. From 1580 to 1583 he frequently visited the Channel Islands as a commissioner to inquire into the status of these possessions.

Norton was the first Remembrancer of the City of London, holding the office from 1570 until his death in 1584.

Norton&#x27;s Calvinism grew, and towards the end of his career he became a fanatic. Norton held several interrogation sessions in the Tower of London using torture instruments such as the rack. His punishment of the Catholics, as their official censor from 1581 onwards, led to his being nicknamed &quot;Rackmaster-General&quot; and &quot;Rackmaster Norton&quot;.

Norton&#x27;s puritanism made him objectionable to the English bishops; he was deprived of his office and thrown into the Tower. Francis Walsingham released him, but Norton&#x27;s health was undermined, and in March 1584 he died in his house at Sharpenhoe, Bedfordshire.

==Literature==
From his eighteenth year Norton began to compose verse. With Jasper Heywood he was a writer of sonnets. He contributed to &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, and in 1560 he co-authored, along with Thomas Sackville, the earliest English tragedy, &quot;Gorboduc&quot;, which was performed before Elizabeth I in the Inner Temple on 18 January 1561.

&quot;Gorboduc&quot; was revised, as &quot;The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex&quot; in 1570. Norton&#x27;s early lyrics have mostly disappeared. His numerous anti-Catholic pamphlets include those on the rebellion of Northumberland and on the projected marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the Duke of Norfolk. Norton also translated Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; (1561) and Alexander Nowell&#x27;s &quot;Catechism&quot; (1570).

&quot;Gorboduc&quot; was edited by William Durrant Cooper (Shakespeare Society, 1847), and Lucy Toulmin Smith in Karl Vollmöller&#x27;s &quot;Englische Sprache-und Literatur-denkmale&quot; (1883).

Two years later, he founded the Northrop Corporation. This firm became a subsidiary of Douglas Aircraft in 1939, so he co-founded a second company named Northrop.

==Early life and entering aviation==
Born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1895, Northrop grew up in Santa Barbara, California. In 1916, Northrop&#x27;s first job in aviation was in working as a draftsman for the Santa Barbara-based Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company. After the outbreak of the First World War, Northrop was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served in the Army Signal Corps. Northrop served in the military for six months before Loughead successfully petitioned for his return to work in the private sector. In 1923, Northrop joined Douglas Aircraft Company, where he participated in the design of the Douglas Round-the-World-Cruiser and worked up to project engineer.

In 1927 he rejoined the Loughead brothers and their newly founded (in 1926) Lockheed Aircraft Company, working as chief engineer on the Lockheed Vega, the civilian transport monoplane with a cantilever wing that produced unusually high performance for that period, and was widely used by such top pilots as Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, and Hubert Wilkins. In 1929 he produced an all-metal monoplane with an engine within the wing structure. Although this aircraft had booms to attach the tail group, it was in fact the first step toward the flying wing.

==Company founding==
In 1929, Northrop struck out on his own, founding the Avion Corporation, which he was forced to sell to United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1930. In 1932, Northrop, backed by Donald Douglas of Douglas Aircraft, founded another company, the Northrop Corporation in El Segundo, California. This company built two highly successful monoplanes, the Northrop Gamma and Northrop Delta.

By 1939 the Northrop Corporation had become a subsidiary of Douglas Aircraft, so Northrop founded another completely independent company of the same name in Hawthorne, California, a site located by Moye Stephens, one of the co-founders.

==Flying wing and other aircraft==

While working at this company, Northrop focused on the flying wing design, which he was convinced was the next major step in aircraft design. His first project, a reduced-scale version tested in 1940, ultimately became the giant Northrop XB-35. The Northrop XP-56 Black Bullet, a welded magnesium fighter was one of the more significant of his World War II designs, along with the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, the first American night interceptor, of which more than 700 were constructed.

His inventions continued into the postwar era of jet aircraft, to produce the Northrop F-89 Scorpion all-weather interceptor, the Northrop YB-49 long-range bomber, the Northrop Snark intercontinental missile, and automatic celestial navigation systems.
He produced a number of flying wings, including the Northrop N-1M, Northrop N-9M, and Northrop XB-35. His ideas regarding flying wing technology were years ahead of the computer and electronic advances of &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; stability systems which allow inherently unstable aircraft like the B-2 Spirit flying wing to be flown like a conventional aircraft.

The flying wing and the pursuit of low drag high lift designs were Northrop&#x27;s passion and its failure to be selected as the next generation bomber platform after World War II, and the subsequent dismantling of all prototypes and incomplete YB-49s, were a severe blow to him. He retired at age 57 in 1952 and virtually ended his association with the company for the next 30 years.

==Later years==

He broke a decades-long silence on the Flying Wing&#x27;s demise in a 1979 television interview, accusing the Air Force of killing the project to punish him for refusing to merge his company with Consolidated Vultee. He alleged that Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington threatened him by saying, &quot;You’ll be goddamned sorry if you don’t&quot;. Symington later left the government to head the very same Consolidated Vultee company Northrop had refused to merge with. Symington called the charge &quot;preposterous and absurd&quot; and told a researcher &quot;There was a tremendous overcapacity in the industry following World War II&quot;. He said Northrop came to him, seeking more business to help his struggling company. Symington said, &quot;I may very well have suggested that he merge his company with Convair, who we knew was going to get business.&quot; Aviation expert Bud Baker, who studied declassified documents and public records and conducted personal interviews with Symington, Air Force generals and Northrop&#x27;s chairman, concluded the cancellation &quot;was a sound decision, based on budgetary, technical, and strategic realities.&quot;

Northrop dabbled in real estate and lost much of his personal fortune. In 1976, with his health failing, he felt compelled to communicate to NASA his belief in the low drag high lift concept inherent in the flying wing. NASA replied that the idea had technological merit, encouraging Northrop that his flying wing concepts had not been completely abandoned. By the late 1970s a variety of illnesses left him unable to walk or speak. Shortly before his death, he was given clearance to see designs and hold a scale model of the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which shared design features of his XB-35 and YB-49. The B-2, for example, has the same 172-foot wingspan as the jet-powered flying wing, YB-49. Northrop reportedly wrote on a sheet of paper &quot;Now I know why God has kept me alive for 25 years&quot;. B-2 project designer John Cashen said, &quot;As he held this model in his shaking hands, it was as if you could see his entire history with the flying wing passing through his mind.&quot; He died ten months later.

==Awards and honors==
In 1947 he received the Spirit of St. Louis Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for &quot;meritorious service in the advancement of aeronautics.&quot;
Investiture in the International Aerospace Hall of Fame came in 1972, and in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1974. He was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2003.

Northrop&#x27;s passion for tailless flight was honored by the naming of a giant tailless pterosaur &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot;.

Hawthorne Municipal Airport is also known as Jack Northrop Field in his honor.

<text>Gregg shorthand is a system of shorthand developed by John Robert Gregg in 1888. Distinguished by its phonemic basis, the system prioritizes the sounds of speech over traditional English spelling, enabling rapid writing by employing elliptical figures and lines that bisect them. Gregg shorthand&#x27;s design facilitates smooth, cursive strokes without the angular outlines characteristic of earlier systems like Duployan shorthand, thereby enhancing writing-speed and legibility.

Over the years, Gregg shorthand has undergone several revisions, each aimed at simplifying the system and increasing its speed and efficiency. These versions range from the Pre-Anniversary editions to the more recent Centennial version, with each adaptation maintaining the core principles while introducing modifications to suit varying needs and preferences.
Its efficiency, once mastered, allows for speeds upwards of 280 words per minute. The system is adaptable to both right- and left-handed writers.

==Background==

Gregg shorthand, invented by John Robert Gregg in 1888, is a form of shorthand that, like cursive longhand, primarily uses elliptical figures and lines that bisect them. The advent of dictation machines, shorthand machines, handheld tape recorders, digital voice recorders, voice recording applications on smartphones, and the trend of executives drafting their own letters on personal computers has led to a gradual decline in shorthand usage in business and reporting contexts.

Gregg shorthand is often compared with Pitman shorthand due to their significant dominance over other English shorthand systems. While Pitman shorthand differentiates between similar sounds through line thickness and position, Gregg shorthand maintains uniform line thickness and uses stroke length to distinguish between sounds.

Initially, John Robert Gregg taught an adaptation of Duployan shorthand for English, a system that was predominant in France and characterized by uniform stroke thickness and attached vowel representation. However, he found the angular outlines of Duployan-based systems to be detrimental to speed.

Gregg shorthand is distinguished by its cursive strokes that blend smoothly, avoiding sharp angles, and its symbols are specifically designed for English, offering a better fit than the Duployan system. For example, Gregg shorthand has a unique symbol for the &quot;th&quot; sound ( and ), in contrast to Duployan systems, which use a dotted &quot;t,&quot; resulting in slower writing.

==Writing==

Gregg shorthand is a system of phonography, or a phonemic writing system, which means it records the sounds of the speaker, not the English spelling. For example, it uses the &quot;f&quot; stroke for the sound in &quot;funnel&quot;, &quot;telephone&quot;, and &quot;laugh&quot;, and omits all silent letters. The system is written from left to right and the letters are joined. &quot;Sh&quot; (= ) (and &quot;zh&quot; = ), &quot;Ch&quot; (= ), and &quot;J&quot; (or &quot;Dzh&quot;, = ) are written downward, while &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are written upward. &quot;X&quot; is expressed by putting a slight backward slant on the &quot;s&quot; symbol, though a word beginning &quot;ex&quot; is just written as if spelt &quot;es&quot; (and, according to Pre-Anniversary, &quot;ox&quot; is written as if &quot;os&quot;). &quot;W&quot; when in the middle of a word, is notated with a short dash under the next vowel. Therefore, the digraph &quot;qu&quot; (= ) is usually written as &quot;k&quot; with a dash underneath the next vowel. In the &quot;Anniversary&quot; edition and before, if &quot;z&quot; need be distinguished from &quot;s&quot;, a small tick drawn at a right angle from the &quot;s&quot; may be written to make this distinction. 

Many of the letters shown are also &quot;brief forms&quot;, or standard abbreviations for the most common words for increased speed in writing. For instance, instead of writing &quot;kan&quot; for &quot;can&quot;, the Gregg stenographer just writes &quot;k&quot;. These brief forms are shown on the adjacent image. There are several others not shown, however. For instance, &quot;please&quot; is written in &quot;Simplified&quot; and before as simply &quot;pl&quot;, and &quot;govern&quot; as &quot;gv&quot;.

Phrasing is another mechanism for increasing the speed of shorthand writing. Based on the notion that lifting the pen between words would have a heavy speed cost, phrasing is the combination of several smaller distinct forms into one outline. For example, &quot;it may be that the&quot; can be written in one outline, &quot;(tm)ab(th)a(th)&quot;. &quot;I have not been able&quot; would be written, &quot;avnba&quot; (note that to the eye of the reader this phrase written in shorthand looks like &quot;I-have-not-been-able&quot;, and so phrasing is far more legible than a longhand explanation of the principle may lead one to believe).

The vowels in Gregg shorthand are divided into groups that very rarely require further notation. The &quot;a&quot; is a large circle, and can stand for the sounds in &quot;trap&quot; , &quot;palm&quot; , and &quot;face&quot; . The &quot;e&quot; is a small circle, and can stand for the sounds in &quot;dress&quot; , &quot;fleece&quot; , &quot;kit&quot; , and &quot;nurse&quot; . &quot;ī&quot; represents the sound in &quot;price&quot; . The &quot;o&quot; is a small hook that represents the sounds in &quot;goat&quot; , &quot;lot&quot; , &quot;thought&quot; , and &quot;north&quot; . The &quot;u&quot; is a small hook that represents the sounds in &quot;strut&quot; , &quot;foot&quot; , and &quot;goose&quot; . It also expresses a &quot;w&quot; at the beginning of a word. In &quot;Anniversary&quot; and before, short and long vowel sounds for e, a, o and u may be distinguished by a mark under the vowel, a dot for short and a small downward tick for long sounds.

There are special vowel markings for certain diphthongs. The ow in &quot;how&quot; is just an &quot;a&quot; circle followed by a &quot;u&quot; hook. The &quot;io&quot; in &quot;lion&quot; , or any diphthong involving a long i and a vowel, is written with a small circle inside a large circle. The &quot;ia&quot; in &quot;piano&quot; and &quot;repudiate&quot; is notated as a large circle with a dot in its center. In &quot;Anniversary&quot; and before, if &quot;ea&quot; need be distinguished from &quot;ia&quot;, it is notated with a small downward tick inside the circle instead of the dot. The &quot;u&quot; in &quot;united&quot; is notated with a small circle followed by an &quot;u&quot; hook above it.

Due to the simple alphabet, Gregg shorthand is very fast in writing; however, it takes a great deal of practice to master it. Speeds of 280 WPM (where a word is 1.4 syllables) have been reached with this system before, and those notes are still legible to others who know the system.

Some left-handed shorthand writers have found it more comfortable to write Gregg shorthand from right to left.

==Versions==

Throughout its history, different forms of Gregg shorthand have been published. All the versions use the same alphabet and basic principles, but they differ in degrees of abbreviation and, as a result, speed. The 1916 version is generally the fastest and most abbreviated version. Series 90 Gregg has the smallest degree of abbreviation, but it is also generally the slowest standard version of Gregg. Though each version differs in its level of abbreviation, most versions have expert and reporting versions for writers who desire more shortcuts.

Many versions of this system were published. Several of these versions were given names: &quot;Anniversary&quot; (published in 1929), &quot;Gregg Shorthand Simplified&quot; (1949), &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; (1963), and &quot;Series 90&quot; (1978). The last version was &quot;Centennial&quot;, published in 1988. Versions published before 1929 are often referred to as Pre-Anniversary. These versions are described below in this article. Besides the main editions, a number of simpler, personal-use editions were published from 1924 to 1968. These included &quot;Greghand&quot; in 1935, and &quot;Notehand&quot; in 1960 and 1968.

===Pre-Anniversary Gregg shorthand===
Gregg Shorthand was first published in England 1888 by John Robert Gregg under the title &quot;Light Line Phonography&quot;; however, it was in a very primal stage. Due to its rough-and-ready character and the fact that Pitman shorthand was well established there, it did not gain much success. Five years later, in 1893, a second edition of the manual with an improved version of the system was published in the USA, then in a third edition titled &quot;Gregg Shorthand&quot; in 1897. The fourth edition, published in 1902, developed more shortcuts. The fifth edition, published in 1916, is the version most commonly referred to as &quot;Pre-Anniversary&quot; Gregg shorthand; this version has the largest number of brief forms, phrases, and shortcuts.

===Gregg Shorthand Anniversary Edition===
In 1929 another version of Gregg shorthand was published. This system reduced the memory load on its learners by decreasing the number of brief forms and removing uncommon prefixes. It was intended to have been published in 1928 on the 40th anniversary of the system, but it was published a year afterward due to a delay in its production.

===Gregg Shorthand Simplified===
&quot;Gregg Shorthand Simplified&quot; was published in 1949. This system drastically reduced the number of brief forms that needed to be memorized to only 181. Even with this reduction in the number of brief forms, one could still reach speeds upward of 150 WPM. The system was simplified to directly address the need of business stenographers, who only needed to produce 100–120 WPM transcription. The creator of an advanced reporting version of Gregg Shorthand, Charles Lee Swem, wrote in &quot;The National Shorthand Reporter&quot;, &quot;An abbreviated, simplified edition of our system has been published and accepted for the purpose of training office stenographers, and not necessarily reporters.&quot; He also advised, &quot;I do not believe any young student should hesitate to study Simplified for fear it will jeopardize his chances of becoming a reporter. It is fundamentally the same system as we reporters learned from the Anniversary edition. Once Simplified is learned, the change-over to the reporting style is comparatively simple and can be made by any writer.&quot;

===Gregg Shorthand Diamond Jubilee Edition===
The Diamond Jubilee series was published through most of the 1960s and the 1970s (1963–1977). It was simpler than the Simplified version, and reduced the number of brief forms to 129. For &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; students who wanted to increase speed for reporting, an edition of &quot;Expert&quot; &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; was available to push speeds upward.

===Gregg Shorthand Series 90===
&quot;Series 90&quot; (1978–1987) was an even simpler version, which used a minimal number of brief forms and placed a great emphasis on clear transcription, rather than reporting speed. Although it introduced a couple of new abbreviations and reintroduced some short forms that were missing in Diamond Jubilee, it eliminated several other short forms, and was in the main simpler, longer, and slower than the previous editions. Shorthand was dwindling in popularity during this series&#x27; usage.

===Gregg Shorthand Centennial Edition===
Published in 1988, this is the most recent series of Gregg shorthand. It was the only version since the Pre-Anniversary edition of 1916 to increase the complexity of the system from the previous one, having 132 brief forms.

===Other versions===
The above versions of Gregg shorthand were marketed for professional use, such as business and court reporting. &quot;Gregg Shorthand Junior Manual&quot;, designed for junior high school students, was published in 1927 and 1929. &quot;Greghand, A Simple Phonetic Writing for Everyday Use by Everyone&quot; was published as a pamphlet in 1935. The 1960 and 1968 editions of &quot;Gregg Notehand&quot; focused on how to take effective classroom and personal notes using a simple form of Gregg shorthand.

==Adaptations==
Gregg shorthand has been adapted to several languages, including Afrikaans, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Catalan, Thai, and Tagalog. With a few customizations, it can be adapted to nearly any language. 
The Mandarin Chinese version slightly modified the original system, under the name &quot;Beifang Suji&quot; (北方
速記 Běifāng sùjì &#x27;Northern Shorthand&#x27;).

<doc id="761957" wikidata="Q2608053" url="?curid=761957" title="Geoffry Northcote">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Alexander Stafford Northcote, KCMG KStJ (羅富國;9 February 1881 – 10 July 1948) was a British colonial administrator.

==Early life, education, and early colonial services career==
Northcote was the son of Reverend the Hon. Arthur Francis Northcote, fourth son of the 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. The 1st Baron Northcote was his uncle. He was educated at Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton and Balliol College, Oxford. He entered the Colonial Service in 1904 and served in Kenya (the East African Protectorate) from 1904 to 1927. He became Chief Secretary of Northern Rhodesia a year later, and served there until 1930. Afterwards, Northcote served as the Chief Secretary of Gold Coast, until 1934 and as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of British Guiana from 1935 to 1937.

==Attack in Kenya==
When he arrived in Kenya in 1904 as a political attache, Northcote was posted to Nyanza Province which was then part of Uganda. In early 1905, he accompanied a punitive expedition to Kisii land in South Nyanza. The expedition seized and slaughtered livestock and torched houses as punishment for raids the Kisii had carried out on neighbouring groups. In 1907, Northcote was deployed as the District Commissioner of Kisii. The Kisii, who nicknamed him &quot;Nyarigoti&quot;, considered him their mortal enemy. On 18 January 1908, in the middle of a punitive expedition he was leading, Northcote was attacked with a spear and injured by a warrior called Otenyo. When Otenyo was caught, he was tried and executed in public by a firing squad and then beheaded. When Northcote learned of these attacks to revenge the attack on him, which ended up costing 160 lives, he wrote to his father, &quot;It would take too long to describe the idiocy, obstinacy and want of military operations.&quot;

==Hong Kong Governorship==

He became Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Hong Kong in 1937. During his tenure, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and battles broke out throughout Mainland China. In order to safeguard the Colony, Northcote immediately declared Hong Kong a neutral zone. As the war proceeded, Canton (Guangzhou) was occupied by the Japanese, causing a population boom as refugees rushed into Hong Kong. Northcote proposed more provision of housing and social services to serve the needs of the poor. Meanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) also started encroaching upon Sham Chun (Shenzhen), leading the Hong Kong government to adopt various measures to cope with the emergency, such as the construction of air-raid shelters and blackout practices. Northcote also withdrew the plan of expanding social services.

After taking six-months&#x27; leave in the UK, Northcote returned to Hong Kong in March 1941. Poor health forced him to retire that year, and he left when his appointment expired in September 1941.
==Personal life==
Northcote married Edith Juliet Mary Adams on 27 October 1910; she was the daughter of James Adams VC. The couple had three sons: Maxwell Adams Stafford, Arthur Geoffrey Stafford, and Amyas Henry Stafford. Northcote died in July 1948, aged 67.

<text>Wave power is the capture of energy of wind waves to do useful work – for example, electricity generation, desalination, or pumping water. A machine that exploits wave power is a wave energy converter (WEC).

Waves are generated primarily by wind passing over the sea&#x27;s surface and also by tidal forces, temperature variations, and other factors. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above, energy is transferred from the wind to the waves. Air pressure differences between the windward and leeward sides of a wave crest and surface friction from the wind cause shear stress and wave growth.

Wave power as a descriptive term is different from tidal power, which seeks to primarily capture the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. However, wave power and tidal power are not fundamentally distinct and have significant cross-over in technology and implementation. Other forces can create currents, including breaking waves, wind, the Coriolis effect, cabbeling, and temperature and salinity differences.

As of 2023, wave power is not widely employed for commercial applications, after a long series of trial projects. Attempts to use this energy began in 1890 or earlier, mainly due to its high power density. Just below the ocean&#x27;s water surface the wave energy flow, in time-average, is typically five times denser than the wind energy flow 20 m above the sea surface, and 10 to 30 times denser than the solar energy flow.

In 2000 the world&#x27;s first commercial wave power device, the Islay LIMPET was installed on the coast of Islay in Scotland and connected to the UK national grid. In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator wave farm was opened in Portugal at the Aguçadoura Wave Farm. Both projects have since ended. For a list of other wave power stations see List of wave power stations.

Wave energy converters can be classified based on their working principle as either:

* oscillating water columns (with air turbine)
* oscillating bodies (with hydroelectric motor, hydraulic turbine, linear electrical generator)
* overtopping devices (with low-head hydraulic turbine)
== History ==

The first known patent to extract energy from ocean waves was in 1799, filed in Paris by Pierre-Simon Girard and his son. An early device was constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to power his house in Royan, France. It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device. From 1855 to 1973 there were 340 patents filed in the UK alone.

Modern pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by Yoshio Masuda&#x27;s 1940s experiments. He tested various concepts, constructing hundreds of units used to power navigation lights. Among these was the concept of extracting power from the angular motion at the joints of an articulated raft, which Masuda proposed in the 1950s.

The oil crisis in 1973 renewed interest in wave energy. Substantial wave-energy development programmes were launched by governments in several countries, in particular in the UK, Norway and Sweden. Researchers re-examined waves&#x27; potential to extract energy, notably Stephen Salter, Johannes Falnes, Kjell Budal, Michael E. McCormick, David Evans, Michael French, Nick Newman, and C. C. Mei.

Salter&#x27;s 1974 invention became known as Salter&#x27;s duck or &quot;nodding duck&quot;, officially the Edinburgh Duck. In small-scale tests, the Duck&#x27;s curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity, giving 81% efficiency. In the 1980s, several other first-generation prototypes were tested, but as oil prices ebbed, wave-energy funding shrank. Climate change later reenergized the field.

The world&#x27;s first wave energy test facility was established in Orkney, Scotland in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry. The European Marine Energy Centre(EMEC) has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than any other single site. Subsequent to its establishment test facilities occurred also in many other countries around the world, providing services and infrastructure for device testing.

The £10 million Saltire prize challenge was to be awarded to the first to be able to generate 100 GWh from wave power over a continuous two-year period by 2017 (about 5.7 MW average). The prize was never awarded. A 2017 study by Strathclyde University and Imperial College focused on the failure to develop &quot;market ready&quot; wave energy devices – despite a UK government investment of over £200 million over 15 years.

Public bodies have continued and in many countries stepped up the research and development funding for wave energy during the 2010s. This includes both EU, US and UK where the annual allocation has typically been in the range 5-50 million USD. Combined with private funding, this has led to a large number of ongoing wave energy projects (see List of wave power projects).

== Physical concepts ==

Like most fluid motion, the interaction between ocean waves and energy converters is a high-order nonlinear phenomenon. It is described using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
formula_1where formula_2 is the fluid velocity, formula_3 is the pressure, formula_4 the density, formula_5 the viscosity, and formula_6 the net external force on each fluid particle (typically gravity). Under typical conditions, however, the movement of waves is described by Airy wave theory, which posits that

* fluid motion is roughly irrotational,
* pressure is approximately constant at the water surface, and
* the seabed depth is approximately constant.

In situations relevant for energy harvesting from ocean waves these assumptions are usually valid.

=== Airy equations ===
The first condition implies that the motion can be described by a velocity potential formula_7:formula_8which must satisfy the Laplace equation,formula_9In an ideal flow, the viscosity is negligible and the only external force acting on the fluid is the earth gravity formula_10. In those circumstances, the Navier-Stokes equations reduces to formula_11which integrates (spatially) to the Bernoulli conservation law:formula_12

=== Linear potential flow theory ===

When considering small amplitude waves and motions, the quadratic term formula_13 can be neglected, giving the linear Bernoulli equation,formula_14and third Airy assumptions then implyformula_15These constraints entirely determine sinusoidal wave solutions of the form formula_16where formula_17 determines the wavenumber of the solution and formula_18 and formula_19 are determined by the boundary constraints (and formula_17). Specifically,formula_21The surface elevation formula_22 can then be simply derived as formula_23a plane wave progressing along the x-axis direction.

==== Consequences ====
Oscillatory motion is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for standing waves (clapotis) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing microseisms. Pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting for wave power conversion.

The behavior of Airy waves offers two interesting regimes: water deeper than half the wavelength, as is common in the sea and ocean, and shallow water, with wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth. Deep waves are dispersionful: Waves of long wavelengths propagate faster and tend to outpace those with shorter wavelengths. Deep-water group velocity is half the phase velocity. Shallow water waves are dispersionless: group velocity is equal to phase velocity, and wavetrains propagate undisturbed.

The following table summarizes the behavior of waves in the various regimes:
=== Wave power formula ===
In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength, the wave energy flux is

:formula_24

with &quot;P&quot; the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, &quot;H&quot;&quot;m0&quot; the significant wave height, &quot;T&quot;&quot;e&quot; the wave energy period, &quot;ρ&quot; the water density and &quot;g&quot; the acceleration by gravity. The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the square of the wave height. When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of wavefront length.

For example, consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline, with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 s. Solving for power produces

:formula_25

or 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest offshore sea states have significant wave height of about 15 meters and energy period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7 MW of power across each meter of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures a significant portion of the wave energy flux. As a result, wave heights diminish in the region behind the device.

=== Energy and energy flux ===

In a sea state, the mean energy density per unit area of gravity waves on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:

:formula_26

where &quot;E&quot; is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m2), the sum of kinetic and potential energy density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy, both contributing half to the wave energy density &quot;E&quot;, as can be expected from the equipartition theorem.

The waves propagate on the surface, where crests travel with the phase velocity while the energy is transported horizontally with the group velocity. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical plane of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is the energy flux (or wave power, not to be confused with the output produced by a device), and is equal to:

:formula_27 with &quot;cg&quot; the group velocity (m/s).

Due to the dispersion relation for waves under gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength &quot;λ&quot;, or equivalently, on the wave period &quot;T&quot;.

Wave height is determined by wind speed, the length of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the bathymetry (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance do not increase wave size. At this limit the waves are said to be &quot;fully developed&quot;. In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wavelength, water density, water depth and acceleration of gravity.

== Wave energy converters ==
Wave energy converters (WECs) are generally categorized by the method, by location and by the power take-off system. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: hydraulic ram, elastomeric hose pump, pump-to-shore, hydroelectric turbine, air turbine, and linear electrical generator. 
The four most common approaches are:

* point absorber buoys
* surface attenuators
* oscillating water columns
* overtopping devices

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface, held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber has a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. Energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the swells&#x27; rise and fall to generate electricity directly via linear generators, generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters, or hydraulic pumps. Energy extracted from waves may affect the shoreline, implying that sites should remain well offshore.

One point absorber design tested at commercial scale by CorPower features a negative spring that improves performance and protects the buoy in very large waves. It also has an internal pneumatic cylinder that keeps the buoy at a fixed distance from the seabed regardless of the state of the tide. Under normal operating conditions, the buoy bobs up and down at double the wave amplitude by adjusting the phase of its movements. It rises with a slight delay from the wave, which allows it to extract more energy. The firm claimed a 300% increase (600 kW) in power generation compared to a buoy without phase adjustments in tests completed in 2024.

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices use multiple floating segments connected to one another. They are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells, and that motion drives hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. The Pelamis Wave Energy Converter is one of the more well-known attenuator concepts, although this is no longer being developed.

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. Energy is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Some designs incorporate parabolic reflectors to focus energy at the point of capture. These systems capture energy from the rise and fall of waves.

=== Oscillating water column ===

Oscillating water column devices can be located onshore or offshore. Swells compress air in an internal chamber, forcing air through a turbine to create electricity. Significant noise is produced as air flows through the turbines, potentially affecting nearby birds and marine organisms. Marine life could possibly become trapped or entangled within the air chamber. It draws energy from the entire water column.

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be on- or offshore.

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters use flexible (typically reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off hydraulic system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters typically use flexible membranes as the working surface between the water and the power take-off. Membranes are pliant and low mass, which can strengthen coupling with the wave&#x27;s energy. Their pliancy allows large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the seafloor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the free surface. Wave loads also diminish in non-linear proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing depth, protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be balanced.

=== Floating in-air converters ===
Floating in-air converters potentially offer increased reliability because the device is located above the water, which also eases inspection and maintenance. Examples of different concepts of floating in-air converters include:

* roll damping energy extraction systems with turbines in compartments containing sloshing water
* horizontal axis pendulum systems
* vertical axis pendulum systems

===Submerged wave energy converters===
In early 2024, a fully submerged wave energy converter using point absorber-type wave energy technology was approved in Spain. The converter includes a buoy that is moored to the bottom and situated below the surface, out of sight of people and away from storm waves.

== Environmental effects ==

Common environmental concerns associated with marine energy include:

* The effects of electromagnetic fields and underwater noise;
* Physical presence&#x27;s potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and seabirds with attraction, avoidance, entanglement
* Potential effect on marine processes such as sediment transport and water quality.
* Foundation/mooring systems can affect benthic organisms via entanglement/entrapment
* Electromotive force effects produced from subsea power cables.
* Minor collision risk 
* Artificial reef accumulation near fixed installations 
* Potential disuption to roosting sites

The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of ocean current energy.

== Potential ==

Wave energy&#x27;s worldwide theoretical potential has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW. Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south temperate zones have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing westerlies in these zones blow strongest in winter.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimated the theoretical wave energy potential for various countries. It estimated that the US&#x27; potential was equivalent to 1170 TWh per year or almost 1/3 of the country&#x27;s electricity consumption. The Alaska coastline accounted for ~50% of the total.

The technical and economical potential will be lower than the given values for the theoretical potential.

== Challenges ==

Environmental impacts must be addressed. Socio-economic challenges include the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen, and may present navigation hazards. Supporting infrastructure, such as grid connections, must be provided. Commercial WECs have not always been successful. In 2019, for example, Seabased Industries AB in Sweden was liquidated due to &quot;extensive challenges in recent years, both practical and financial&quot;.

Current wave power generation technology is subject to many technical limitations. These limitations stem from the complex and dynamic nature of ocean waves, which require robust and efficient technology to capture the energy. Challenges include designing and building wave energy devices that can withstand the corrosive effects of saltwater, harsh weather conditions, and extreme wave forces. Additionally, optimizing the performance and efficiency of wave energy converters, such as oscillating water column (OWC) devices, point absorbers, and overtopping devices, requires overcoming engineering complexities related to the dynamic and variable nature of waves. Furthermore, developing effective mooring and anchoring systems to keep wave energy devices in place in the harsh ocean environment, and developing reliable and efficient power take-off mechanisms to convert the captured wave energy into electricity, are also technical challenges in wave power generation. As the wave energy dissipation by a submerged flexible mound breakwater is greater than that of a rigid submerged structure, greater wave energy dissipation is expected due to highly deformed shape of the structure.

== Wave farms ==
A wave farm (wave power farm or wave energy park) is a group of colocated wave energy devices. The devices interact hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, spacing and layout, wave climate, coastal and benthic geometry, and control strategies. The design process is a multi-optimization problem seeking high power production, low costs and limited power fluctuations. Nearshore wave farms have substantial impact on beach dynamics. For instance, wave farms significantly reduce erosion which demonstrates that this synergy between coastal protection and energy production enhances the economic viability of wave energy. Additional research finds that wave farms located near lagoons can potentially provide effective coastal protection during maritime spatial planning.

<text>Lauris Norstad (March 24, 1907 – September 12, 1988) was an American general officer in the United States Army and United States Air Force.

==Early life and military career==
Lauris Norstad was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Martin and Marie Norstad. Martin Norstad was born in Iowa to Norwegian immigrants from Rogaland. Lauris earned his high school diploma from Red Wing Central High School in 1925. He graduated from the United States Military Academy June 12, 1930 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army as a cavalry officer. In September 1930, he entered Primary Flying School at March Field, California, and graduated from Advanced Flying School and was transferred to the Air Corps in June 1931. Going to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, in January 1932, he was assigned to the 18th Pursuit Group, assuming command of it in July 1933. In March 1936 he was named adjutant of the Ninth Bomb Group there. Entering the &quot;short course&quot; the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in September 1939, he graduated three months later and returned to Mitchel Field as officer in charge of the 9th Bomb Group Navigation School.
Moving to Langley Field, Virginia, in July 1940, Norstad was adjutant of the 25th Bomb Group, and the following November he was named assistant chief of staff for intelligence of General Headquarters Air Force there. In February 1942 he was appointed a member of the Advisory Council to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces at Washington, DC.

==World War II==

In August 1942, Norstad was named assistant chief of staff for operations (A-3) of the Twelfth Air Force, going to England with it the following month in support of Operation Husky, and to Algiers, North Africa in October 1942. Here he met General Dwight Eisenhower, who said of him: &quot;It was on that occasion that I first met Lieutenant Colonel Lauris Norstad, a young air officer who so impressed me by his alertness, grasp of problems, and personality that I never thereafter lost sight of him. He was and is one of those rare men whose capacity knows no limit.&quot; During his time in North Africa, future atomic strike commander Paul Tibbets was briefly on his staff. In his autobiography, Tibbets claimed that he embarrassed Norstad in a strike planning meeting by being critical of his decision to bomb a target at low altitude, (offering to lead it himself at 6000 feet if Norstad would fly with him as co-pilot) and Norstad was in the process of having him court-martialled before Gen Jimmy Doolittle got Tibbets transferred back to the states before Norstad could sink his career. Tibbets also claimed that Norstad was a &quot;social climber&quot; and political animal in the Air Force and that he aligned himself tightly with Hoyt Vandenberg and followed him up the chain of command.

In February 1943, he was promoted to brigadier general and assumed the additional duty of assistant chief of staff for operations of the Northwest African Air Forces. In December 1943 he was appointed director of operations of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces at Algiers, moving with it to Caserta, Italy, two months later.

Norstad was transferred to Washington, D.C. in August 1944, where he was deputy chief of Air Staff at Army Air Force Headquarters with added duty as chief of staff of the 20th Air Force. He was relieved of this additional duty May 8, 1945, and assumed additional duty as assistant chief of Air Staff for Plans at Army Air Force Headquarters. He was promoted to major general the following month.
Relieved of his assignment as chief of staff of the 20th Air Force in February 1946, he continued as assistant chief of air staff for plans until the following June, when he was appointed director of the Plans and Operations Division of the War Department at Washington, DC.

On October 1, 1947, following the division of the War Department into the Departments of the Army and Air Force, General Norstad transferred to the Air Force and was appointed deputy chief of staff for operations of the Air Force, and the following May assumed additional duty as acting vice chief of staff of the Air Force.

==SHAPE leadership==

Joining the U.S. Air Forces in Europe in October 1950 General Norstad was commander in chief, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, with headquarters at Wiesbaden, Germany. On April 2, 1951 he assumed additional duty as commanding general of the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe under the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Europe. He was designated air deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, on July 27, 1953.

After serving as air deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) on November 20, 1956, Norstad was appointed as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and commander in chief of U.S. European Command, the first Air Force officer to hold these posts. He served in the top post for European Command until November 1, 1962 and as SACEUR until December 31, 1962 when General Lyman Lemnitzer replaced him after his resignation over a disagreement with the withdrawal by President Kennedy of SACEUR&#x27;s authority to decide on the use of tactical nuclear forces. Norstad initially encouraged France to develop its own nuclear capacity, but then abandoned the idea once he grew disillusioned with French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s interference with NATO.

==Later years==
General Norstad retired from the USAF on January 2, 1963. After his military retirement, he became the Chief Executive Officer and President of Owens Corning from 1963 until 1972 and also served on the Board of Directors of Rand Corporation. Norstad was critical of the Vietnam War, and in 1967 proposed a halt to the bombing of North Vietnam, a unilateral ceasefire, and an end to American reinforcements sent to South Vietnam, followed by a summit to negotiate a treaty. He died on September 12, 1988, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

<text>Ronald George Wreyford Norrish FRS (9 November 1897 – 7 June 1978) was a British chemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967.

==Education and early life==
Norrish was born in Cambridge and was educated at The Perse School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He was a former student of Eric Rideal. From an early age he was interested in chemistry, walking up and down Cambridge University chemical laboratory admiring all the equipment. His father encouraged him to construct and equip a small laboratory in his garden shed in his garden and supplied all the chemicals he needed to conduct experiments. This apparatus now forms part of the Science Museum collections - reference shows copper water tank He used to enter competitions for the analysis of mixtures sent round by the Pharmaceutical Journal and often won prizes. In 1915 Norrish won a Foundation Scholarship to Emmanuel College, but by adding a little to his age joined the Royal Field Artillery and served as a Lieutenant, first in Ireland and then on the Western Front.

==Career and research==
Norrish was a prisoner in World War I and later commented, with sadness, that many of his contemporaries and potential competitors at Cambridge had not survived the War. Military records show that 2nd Lieutenant Norrish of the Royal Artillery went missing (captured) on 21 March 1918.
Norrish rejoined Emmanuel College as a Research Fellow in 1925 and later became Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. For many years, the Department of Physical Chemistry occupied the left-hand side of the Lensfield Road building with the other (and separate) department of &#x27;Chemistry&#x27; (which encompassed organic, theoretical and inorganic chemistry) led by (Lord) Alexander R. Todd being accessed by turning right at the main entrance. Both departments had separate administrative, technical and academic personnel until they merged to form one chemistry department under John Meurig Thomas in the early 1980s. Norrish researched photochemistry using continuous light sources (including after the war, searchlights).

The skill which Norrish displayed in his laboratory work problems marked him out amongst his contemporaries as an unusually gifted and energetic experimentalist, capable of making significant advances in photo-chemistry and gas kinetics.

==Awards and honours==
Norrish was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1936. As a result of the development of flash photolysis, Norrish was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 along with Manfred Eigen and George Porter for their study of extremely fast chemical reactions. One of his accomplishments is the development of the Norrish reaction.

At Cambridge, Norrish supervised Rosalind Franklin, future DNA researcher and colleague of James Watson and Francis Crick, and experienced some conflict with her.

<doc id="761987" wikidata="Q2411874" url="?curid=761987" title="Smith River (California)">
<text>The Smith River (Tolowa: ) flows from the Klamath Mountains to the Pacific Ocean in Del Norte County in extreme northwestern California, on the West Coast of the United States. The river, about 25.1 miles (40.4 km) long, all within Del Norte County, flows through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park.

==Course==
The Smith River is formed by the confluence of its Middle Fork and North Fork, near the community of Gasquet. The Middle Fork, long, rises in Del Norte County, approximately northeast of Crescent City, and flows west. The North Fork Smith River, long, rises in Oregon on the northeast slope of Chetco Peak. The South Fork Smith River enters the Smith River near the community of Hiouchi. The fork rises on the eastern edge of the Smith River National Recreation Area, approximately east-northeast of Crescent City, flowing southwest and then northwest.

From the confluence with the South Fork, the Smith River flows generally northwest, entering the Pacific Ocean near the community of Smith River, approximately north of Crescent City. Smith River estuary is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.

==Watershed==
The river&#x27;s watershed catchment area is . It drains a rugged area of the western Klamath Mountains and Northern Outer California Coast Ranges, west of the Siskiyou Mountains, barely across the Oregon border, and north of the watershed of the Klamath River.

By average discharge, the Smith is the largest river system in California that flows freely along its entire course. The highly variable annual flow is approximately , with an average monthly high of in January, and an average low of in September. The all-time highest flow was on December 22, 1964, during the Christmas flood of 1964.

The river was named for the explorer Jedediah Smith.

==Conservation==
The free-flowing nature of the river—without a single dam along its entire length—makes it especially prized among conservationists and is considered one of the crown jewels of the National Wild and Scenic River program.


==Crossings==
The 1929 Smith River Bridge, also known as the Hiouchi Bridge or Bridge Wo. 1-06, was a rare example of a cantilever highway truss bridge within California, until it was demolished in 1989. The two-lane road bridge carried U.S. Highway 199 across the Smith River. The structural steel components were fabricated by Virginia Bridge &amp; Iron Co. in Roanoke, shipped via the Panama Canal to San Francisco, then reloaded to a smaller coastal vessel and shipped to Crescent City. The suspended center span was a Parker truss.

It was the first cantilever truss type designed by the California Division of Highways Bridge Department engineers in 1928. The bridge type was briefly popular during the late 1920s to the late 1930s in the United States, but because it was best suited to specialized applications only limited numbers were built in the state. Its design was influenced by the first Carquinez Bridge, designed by David B. Steinman and completed in 1927 (demolished 2007).

Studies for the replacement of the Smith River Bridge began in 1987. U. S. Highway 199 provides a link between Highway 101 at Crescent City on the northern California coast, and Interstate Highway 5 inland at Grants Pass, Oregon. The proposal to replace the bridge was based on its functionally obsolete structural condition. Because of the high percentage of heavy truck traffic using the route, the bridge had sustained damage from high loads over the years, causing concern that the bridge was susceptible to collapsing.

Since it had been determined eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, it was required to be documented to Historic American Engineering Record−HAER standards prior to its removal in 1989.

== In popular culture ==
For the 1983 movie &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the 3rd film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, the Smith River and its surrounding forests and the community of Smith River were used as filming locations for most of the Endor scenes, although a miniaturized set was used for the battle sequences.

<doc id="762001" wikidata="Q925657" url="?curid=762001" title="My Way">
<text>&quot;My Way&quot; is Paul Anka&#x27;s English-language version of the French song &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude,&quot; released by Frank Sinatra in 1969. The original song was written by Jacques Revaux, Gilles Thibaut, and Claude François, and was first recorded by the latter in 1967.

The song was a success for a variety of performers, including Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Sid Vicious. Sinatra&#x27;s version of &quot;My Way&quot; spent 75 weeks in the UK Top 40, which is the 4th most weeks in UK chart history.

==Background==
In 1967, Jacques Revaux wrote a ballad named &quot;For Me&quot;, with English lyrics about a couple falling out of love. According to Revaux, the demo was then sent to Petula Clark, Dalida, and Claude François, to no avail. Revaux rejected a version by Hervé Vilard, the singer of the international hit &quot;Capri c&#x27;est fini&quot; and reworked the track into &quot;Comme d&#x27;habitude&quot; (&quot;As usual&quot;) with the help of Claude François. It was released in November 1967 and was at the top of the French pop chart for one week in February 1968.

In 1968, seeking to capitalize on the song&#x27;s European success, music publisher David Pitt asked a young David Bowie, who was then working as a for-hire songwriter, to tackle an English version of the lyrics to &quot;Comme D&#x27;Habitude&quot; for release in English-speaking markets. Bowie wrote and recorded a demo version of his interpretation, &quot;Even A Fool Learns To Love.&quot; But the song was not formally recorded, and the project was shelved. (Bowie later developed his idea into a wholly original song, &quot;Life on Mars?,&quot; which became a hit single for him and one of his signature songs.)

Paul Anka heard the French original while on holiday in the south of France. He flew to Paris to negotiate the rights to the song. He acquired adaptation, recording, and publishing rights for the nominal, but formal, consideration of one dollar, subject to the provision that the three songwriters would retain their original share of royalty rights with respect to whatever versions Anka or his designates created or produced. Some time later, Anka had a dinner in Florida with Frank Sinatra and &quot;a couple of Mob guys&quot; during which Sinatra said: &quot;I&#x27;m quitting the business. I&#x27;m sick of it; I&#x27;m getting the hell out.&quot;

Back in New York, Anka re-wrote the original French song for Sinatra, subtly altering the melodic structure and changing the lyrical theme: At one o&#x27;clock in the morning, I sat down at an old IBM electric typewriter and said, &#x27;If Frank were writing this, what would he say?&#x27; And I started, metaphorically, &#x27;And now the end is near.&#x27; I read a lot of periodicals, and I noticed everything was &#x27;my this&#x27; and &#x27;my that&#x27;. We were in the &#x27;me generation&#x27; and Frank became the guy for me to use to say that. I used words I would never use: &#x27;I ate it up and spit it out.&#x27; But that&#x27;s the way he talked. I used to be around steam rooms with the Rat Pack guys—they liked to talk like Mob guys, even though they would have been scared of their own shadows. Anka finished the song at 5 in the morning: &quot;I called Frank up in Nevada—he was at Caesars Palaceand said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got something really special for you. Anka asserted: &quot;When my record company caught wind of it, they were very pissed that I didn&#x27;t keep it for myself. I said, &#x27;Hey, I can write it, but I&#x27;m not the guy to sing it.&#x27; It was for Frank, no one else.&quot;

On December 30, 1968, Frank Sinatra recorded his version of the song in one take, featuring session drummer Buddy Saltzman among the band. &quot;My Way&quot; was released in early 1969 on the &quot;My Way&quot; LP and as a single. It reached No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart in the US. In the UK, the single achieved a still unmatched record, becoming the recording with the most weeks inside the Top 40, spending 75 weeks from April 1969 to September 1971. It spent a further 47 weeks in the Top 75 but never bettered the No. 5 slot achieved upon its first chart run.

&quot;Billboard&quot; said that the &quot;driving, lush and commercial Don Costa arrangement and production is an added plus to one of Sinatra&#x27;s finest performances.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;The powerful material is matched by a splendidly moving performance which is certain to win rave comments from programmers with teen and adult audiences.&quot;

Although this work became Frank Sinatra&#x27;s signature song, his daughter Tina says the singer came to hate the song: &quot;He didn&#x27;t like it. That song stuck and he couldn&#x27;t get it off his shoe. He always thought that song was self-serving and self-indulgent.&quot;

In 2000, the 1969 release of &quot;My Way&quot; by Frank Sinatra on Reprise Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Despite asserting that he never intended to sing the song himself, Anka recorded &quot;My Way&quot; in 1969, shortly after Sinatra&#x27;s recording was released. Anka recorded it four other times as well: in 1996 (as a duet with Gabriel Byrne, performed in the movie &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot;); in 1998 in Spanish as &quot;A Mi Manera&quot; (duet with Julio Iglesias); in 2007 (as a duet with Jon Bon Jovi); and in 2013 (as a duet with Garou).

==Charts==


==Certifications==


==Versions==
David Bowie wrote the first English-language lyrics to Claude François&#x27; original song, though the lyrics and performance were only informally recorded and never commercially published. The version by Brook Benton reached number 49 in Canada in May 1970.

===Dorothy Squires===
In the midst of Sinatra&#x27;s multiple runs on the UK Singles Chart, Welsh singer Dorothy Squires also released a rendition of &quot;My Way&quot; in summer 1970. Her recording reached number 25 on the UK Singles Chart and re-entered the chart twice more during that year.

===Elvis Presley===
Elvis Presley began performing the song in concert during the mid-1970s, despite Anka&#x27;s suggestions that the song did not suit him. Nevertheless, on January 12 and 14, 1973, Presley sang the song during his satellite show &quot;Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite&quot;, beamed live and on deferred basis (for European audiences, who also saw it in prime time), to 43 countries via Intelsat.

On October 3, 1977, several weeks after Presley&#x27;s death, his live recording of &quot;My Way&quot; (recorded for the &quot;Elvis in Concert&quot; CBS-TV special on June 21, 1977) was released as a single. In the U.S., it reached number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart in late 1977/early 1978 (higher than Frank Sinatra&#x27;s peak position), number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, and went gold for its successful sales of over a million copies. The following year the single reached number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country singles chart but went all the way to number 1 on the rival Cash Box Country Singles chart. In the UK, it reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.

Presley&#x27;s version is featured in the climax of the 2001 film &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot; (Paul Anka appears in a cameo as a casino pit boss who loathes Presley).

Presley&#x27;s studio version of the song, recorded in 1971, was included on the fourth disc of &quot;Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential &#x27;70s Masters&quot;.

====Certifications====


===Sid Vicious===
Sex Pistols&#x27; bassist Sid Vicious did a punk rock version of the song, in which a large body of the words were changed and the arrangement was sped up. The orchestral backing was arranged by Simon Jeffes.

Interviewed in 2007, Paul Anka said he had been &quot;somewhat destabilized by the Sex Pistols&#x27; version. It was kind of curious, but I felt he [Sid Vicious] was sincere about it.&quot;

Vicious and his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, changed many of the words when it was recorded, including use of the swear words &quot;cunt&quot; and &quot;fuck&quot; as well as the word &quot;queer&quot; (slang for a gay man). Vicious&#x27;s reference to a &quot;prat who wears hats&quot; was an in-joke directed towards Vicious&#x27;s friend and Sex Pistols bandmate Johnny Rotten, who was fond of wearing different kinds of hats he would pick up at rummage sales.

Leonard Cohen said of the song: 

The 1986 film &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; features a scene where Gary Oldman, portraying Vicious, performs his version of &quot;My Way&quot; while filming the song&#x27;s music video.

Vicious&#x27;s version of this song appears in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; where it plays over the end credits.

===Margaret Mackie and Jamie Lee Morley===
In December 2019 footage of Margaret Mackie, a resident of Northcare Suites Care Home in Edinburgh who suffers from dementia, performing &quot;My Way&quot; with staff member Jamie Lee Morley, went viral after being posted online by Mackie&#x27;s daughter.

Morley later arranged to have the song professionally recorded and it was released in January 2020 as a charity single to raise funds for Alzheimer&#x27;s Society and Dementia UK. The single peaked at number four in the iTunes top 40 UK Pop Songs live chart and number two in the Amazon best seller chart.

=== Yūzō Kayama ===
In Japan, Yūzō Kayama, who is usually called the Japanese Frank Sinatra, performed &quot;My Way&quot; in 2008 in English. On April 23 and 30, 2015, as part of 2 vocal overdubbed sessions, Yūzō Kayama performed &quot;My Way&quot; with the earlier record of Frank Sinatra as a duet.

==Public use==
The song is popularly associated with nostalgia to an individual&#x27;s lifetime of events. Surveys beginning in 2005 have often reported that &quot;My Way&quot; has been the song most frequently played at funeral services in the UK. In her memoir &quot;Walk Through Walls&quot;, Marina Abramović expressed her desire for Nina Simone&#x27;s version of &quot;My Way&quot; to be performed by Anohni at her funeral.

&quot;My Way&quot; is also a popular karaoke song around the world. However, it has been reported to cause numerous incidents of violence and homicide among karaoke singers in the Philippines, referred to in the media as the My Way killings, which has led to the song being banned in many Filipino bars.

The song&#x27;s association with Sinatra led to Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policy of allowing other states in the Warsaw Pact to make their own policy decisions being nicknamed the Sinatra Doctrine, referencing the lyrics about doing things one&#x27;s own way. The term was first used by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov in 1987, who was quoted as saying &quot;We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine. He has a song, &quot;I Did It My Way.&quot; So every country decides on its own which road to take.&quot;

In 2024, the song was played at Alexei Navalny&#x27;s funeral. French singer Yseult sang it at the end of the 2024 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony at Stade de France in Paris.

<text>George Alexander Norris (24 December 1928 – 12 March 2013) was a Canadian artist and sculptor. Norris is best known for his many public sculptures in Vancouver, British Columbia.

== Biography ==
George Norris was born in Victoria, British Columbia on Christmas Eve 1928 to George and Christina Norris. He studied at the Vancouver School of Art, and later under the tutelage of Ivan Meštrović at Syracuse University. In 1955 he won a British Council scholarship to study at the Slade School of Fine Art in London. Following this period he returned to Vancouver where he began his professional career.

Norris&#x27;s best-known works are &quot;The Crab&quot; (1967), located outside the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre in Vancouver, and the panels on the University of Victoria&#x27;s McPherson Library (1963).

In 1960 Norris married Phyllis Piddington, who had grown up at &quot;Wychbury&quot; on Esquimalt, an estate home designed by Samuel Maclure. They had three children: Anna, Samuel, and Alexander. In 1993 the couple moved to Shawnigan Lake. After Norris suffered a head injury in a hiking accident, the couple moved to Victoria in 2008. Norris died on 12 March 2013 at age 84.

<doc id="762007" wikidata="Q435947" url="?curid=762007" title="George W. Norris">
<text>George William Norris (July 11, 1861September 2, 1944) was an American politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. He served five terms in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican, from 1903 until 1913, and five terms in the United States Senate, from 1913 until 1943. He served four terms as a Republican and his final term as an Independent. Norris was defeated for re-election in 1942.
Norris was a leader of progressive and liberal causes in Congress. He is best known for his sponsorship of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 during the Great Depression. It became a major development agency in the Upper South that constructed dams for flood control and electricity generation for a wide rural area. In addition, Norris was known for his liberalism, his insurgency against party leaders, his non-interventionist foreign policy, his support for labor unions, and his intense crusades against what he characterized as &quot;wrong and evil&quot;.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt called him &quot;the very perfect, gentle knight of American progressive ideals&quot;, and this has been the theme of all his biographers. A 1957 advisory panel of 160 scholars recommended that Norris was the top choice for the five best Senators in U.S. history.

==Early life==

Norris was born in 1861 in York Township, Sandusky County, Ohio. He was the eleventh child of poor, uneducated farmers of Scots-Irish and Pennsylvania Dutch descent. He graduated from Baldwin University and earned his LL.B. degree in 1883 at the law school of Valparaiso University.

He moved west to practice law, settling in Beaver City, Nebraska. In 1889 he married Pluma Lashley; the couple had three daughters (Gertrude, Hazel, and Marian) before her 1901 death. The widower Norris married Ellie Leonard in 1903; they had no children.

==Political career==
===House insurgent===

In 1900 Norris relocated to the larger town of McCook, where he became active as a Republican in local politics. In 1902, running as a Republican, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Nebraska&#x27;s 5th congressional district.

In that election, he was supported by the railroads; however, in 1906 he broke with them, supporting Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s plans to regulate rates for the benefit of shippers, such as the merchants who lived in his district. A prominent insurgent after 1908, Norris led the revolt in 1910 against House Speaker Joseph G. Cannon. By a vote of 191 to 156, the House legislators created a new system in which seniority would automatically move members ahead, even against the wishes of the leadership. This had the practical effect for several decades of benefiting Southern Democratic congressmen, who became powerful in both the House and the Senate. Because Southern states had effectively disenfranchised most blacks by new constitutions and discriminatory practices at the turn of the century, it was a one-party region, known as the Solid South, representing only white voters.

In January 1911, Norris helped create the National Progressive Republican League and served as its vice president. He originally supported Robert M. La Follette, Sr. for the 1912 presidential nomination but then switched to Roosevelt. However, he refused to leave the Republican convention and join Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive Party. He instead ran for the Senate as a Republican.

===Senator===

As a leading Progressive Republican, Norris supported the direct election of senators, ratified by the states in the Seventeenth Amendment. He also promoted the conversion of all state legislatures to the unicameral system. Only the Nebraska Legislature passed this change in 1934. All other states have retained a two-house system.

Norris supported some of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s domestic programs but became a firm isolationist, fearing that bankers were manipulating the country into war. In the face of enormous pressure from the media and the administration, Norris was one of only six senators to vote against the declaration of war on Germany in 1917. 
Looking at the war in Europe, he said, &quot;Many instances of cruelty and inhumanity can be found on both sides.&quot; Norris believed the government wanted to enter this war only because the wealthy had already aided the British financially in the war. He told Congress the only people who would benefit from the war were &quot;munition manufacturers, stockbrokers, and bond dealers&quot;, adding that
&quot;war brings no prosperity to the great mass of common and patriotic citizens... War brings prosperity to the stock gambler on Wall Streetto those who are already in possession of more wealth than can be realized or enjoyed.&quot;

Norris joined the Irreconcilables, who opposed and defeated U.S. participation in the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations in 1919.

After several terms, Norris&#x27;s seniority gained him the chairmanship of the Agriculture and Forestry and the Judiciary committees. Norris was a leader of the Farm Bloc, advocated the rights of labor, sponsored the (&quot;Lame Duck&quot;) Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and proposed to abolish the Electoral College. He failed on these issues in the 1920s.

In that period, he blocked industrialist Henry Ford&#x27;s proposals to modernize the Tennessee Valley by building a private dam at Muscle Shoals, insisting it was a project the federal government should handle. Norris twice succeeded in getting Congress to pass legislation for a federal electric power system based at Muscle Shoals, but it was vetoed by presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. Norris said of Hoover: 
:Using his power of veto, he destroyed the Muscle Shoals billa measure designated to utilize the great government property at Muscle Shoals for the cheapening of fertilizer for American agriculture and utilization of the surplus power for the benefit of people without transmission distance of the development. The power people want no yardstick which would expose their extortionate rates so Hoover killed the bill after it had been passed by both houses of congress.

In 1933 the project for the Muscle Shoals Bill became part of the New Deal&#x27;s Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).

Although a nominal Republican (which was essential to his seniority), Norris routinely attacked and voted against the Republican administrations of Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. Norris supported Democrats Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in 1928 and 1932, respectively. Republican regulars called him one of the &quot;sons of the wild jackass&quot;.

Norris was a staunch &quot;dry&quot;, battling against alcohol even when the crusade lost favor during the Great Depression. Prohibition was ended in 1933. He told voters prohibition means &quot;this greatest evil of all mankind is driven from the homes of the American people,&quot; even if it means &quot;we are giving up some of our personal rights and personal privileges.&quot;

In 1932, along with Fiorello H. La Guardia (R-New York), a Representative from New York City, Norris secured passage of the Norris–La Guardia Act. It prohibited the practice of employers&#x27; requiring prospective employees to commit to not joining a labor union as a condition of employment (the so-called yellow-dog contract) and greatly limited the use of court injunctions against strikes.

Norris opposed anti-lynching legislation, claiming it was unconstitutional and would lead to another civil war. He voted in 1935 along primarily with Democrats to adjourn the United States Senate as the chamber was deadlocked over the Costigan-Wagner Act; the anti-lynching bill was ultimately defeated. In spite of his opposition towards anti-lynching bills, Norris led efforts to outlaw poll taxes.
====New Dealer====

A staunch supporter of President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs, Norris sponsored the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933. In appreciation, the Norris Dam and Norris, Tennessee, a new planned city, were named after him. Norris was also the prime Senate supporter of the Rural Electrification Act, which brought electrical service to underserved and unserved rural areas across the United States. Given Norris&#x27;s belief in &quot;public power&quot;, no privately owned electric utilities have operated in Nebraska since the late 1940s.

Norris believed in the wisdom of the common people and in the progress of civilization. &quot;To get good government and to retain it, it is necessary that a liberty-loving, educated, intelligent people should be ever watchful, to carefully guard and protect their rights and liberties,&quot; Norris said in a 1934 speech, &quot;The Model Legislature&quot;. The people were capable of being the government, he said, affirming his populist/progressive credentials. To alert the people, he called for transparency in government. &quot;Publicity,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;is the greatest cure for evils which may exist in government&quot;.
In 1936 Norris left the Republican Party, as the Democratic majority had reduced his seniority power. The Democrats offered him chairmanships. That year he was re-elected to the Senate as an Independent with some Democratic Party support. Norris won with 43.8% of the vote against Republican former congressman Robert G. Simmons (who came in second) and Democratic former congressman Terry Carpenter (who came in a distant third).

Norris opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 to pack the Supreme Court, and railed against corrupt patronage. In late 1937, when Norris saw the famous photograph &quot;Bloody Saturday&quot; (showing a burned Chinese baby crying in a bombed-out train station after the Japanese invasion), he shifted his stance on isolationism and non-interventionism. Siding against Japanese violence in China and Korea, he called the Japanese &quot;disgraceful, ignoble, barbarous, and cruel, even beyond the power of language to describe&quot;. He served as vice-president of the League of Friends of Korea, which advocated for Korea&#x27;s independence.

Unable to secure Democratic support in the state in 1942, Norris was defeated by Republican Kenneth S. Wherry. He departed from office saying, &quot;I have done my best to repudiate wrong and evil in government affairs.&quot;

==Legacy and memorials==
Norris is one of eight senators profiled in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, included for opposing Speaker Cannon&#x27;s autocratic power in the House, for speaking out against arming U.S. merchant ships during the United States&#x27; neutral period in World War I, and for supporting the presidential campaign of Democrat Al Smith.

The principal north–south street through downtown McCook, Nebraska, is named George Norris Avenue. Norris&#x27;s house in McCook is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and is operated as a museum by the Nebraska State Historical Society.

In February 1984, the west legislative chamber of the Nebraska State Capitol, home of the legislature since 1937, was named in Norris&#x27;s honor.

George W. Norris Middle School in Omaha, Nebraska; the George W. Norris K–12 school system near Firth, Nebraska; and George W. Norris Elementary School in Millard Public Schools, memorialize the late Senator. When several public power districts in southeastern Nebraska merged into one in 1941, the new utility was named the Norris Public Power District in Senator Norris&#x27;s honor.

On 11 July 1961, a four-cent stamp was issued in his honor. It depicts, in shades of green, a TVA dam in the upper left, with his portrait in later life, to the right. &quot;Gentle knight of progressive ideals&quot; a quote on his character from FDR, is inscribed at the bottom left, while George W. Norris appears below his portrait.

Also in 1961, Norris was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame.

Norris Electric, an energy co-op with headquarters in Newton, IL, is named after Norris and his progressive efforts to electrify the nation.

<doc id="762011" wikidata="Q5191462" url="?curid=762011" title="Crème de Noyaux">
<text>Crème de Noyaux () is an almond-flavored crème liqueur, although it is actually made from apricot kernels or the kernels of peach or cherry pits, which provide an almond-like flavor. Both Bols and Hiram Walker produce artificially colored red versions of the liqueur (either of which contribute the pink hue to Pink Squirrel cocktails) while Noyau de Poissy from France is available in both clear (&quot;blanc&quot;) and barrel-aged amber (&quot;ambre&quot;) versions.

Historically, crème de noyaux would contain trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide, which is poisonous. Although the chemical was not normally present in a dangerous intensity, bottles of 19th-century Noyaux left for decades in the cellar would sometimes have all the cyanide float up to the top, with lethal results for the drinker of the first glass. Dorothy Sayers used this peculiarity of the old Crème de Noyaux in her short story &quot;Bitter Almonds&quot; (collected in &quot;In the Teeth of the Evidence&quot;, 1939).

The name comes from the French &quot;noyau&quot;: &quot;kernel, pit, or core&quot;. It is an ingredient in the Fairbank cocktail, the Pink Squirrel cocktail and in a cocktail called Old Etonian.

In 2013, Tempus Fugit Spirits recreated a 19th-century-style Crème de Noyaux – distilling both apricot and cherry pits, amongst other botanicals, and coloring the liqueur with red cochineal, as was done in the past. Care was taken to remove the trace elements of hydrogen cyanide produced in the process.
==Noyau de Poissy==
&quot;Noyau de Poissy&quot; is a liqueur made from apricot kernel almonds, macerated or distilled in a superfine alcohol, in the presence, according to the recipes, of fine wine brandy, enriched with plants and subtly flavored.
There are therefore 2 Noyau de Poissy liqueurs:
* The Silver Goblet has an alcohol content of 25%, is amber in color and offers a scent of sweet almond pleasantly carried by a fine note of Armagnac;
* The Seal of Saint Louis is a spirit with 40% alcohol, is transparent and expresses an elegant, powerful and very expressive scent of sweet almond with notes of frangipane and orange blossom.
It should be added:
* Le Noyau de Vernon, infusion of cherry pits and almonds mixed with kirsch brandy. A distillery, bearing the name of this spirit, was created in the nineteenth century in the city of Vernon before disappearing in the 1980s and seeing its production continue by the company Vedrenne.

<text>Charles Norris (24 August 1779 – 16 October 1858) was an English topographical etcher and writer who is best known for his landscape work of the Welsh countryside, especially the area around Tenby.

==History==
Norris was born in London in 1779, to John Norris (1721-1786), a wealthy merchant, by his mistress Deborah Busby. In 1800, Charles Norris moved to Milford in Wales, but by 1810 he had moved further down the coast to Tenby. He came to note as an etcher of landscapes of the Pembrokeshire countryside, but mainly of Tenby. Norris is seen as an important recorder of Medieval buildings of Pembrokeshire, due to the lack of alternative recordings during the period.

In the late 1810s, Norris was given a plot of land by the Burgesses of Tenby, in recognition of his work in promoting the town. Norris used the land to construct Waterwynch House, a building that he lived in until his death in 1858. In 1920 Waterwynch House became the residence of Lord and Lady Risdale.

Many of Norris&#x27; original works are kept by Tenby Museum and Art Gallery.

<text>Charles Gilman Norris (April 23, 1881 – July 25, 1945) was an American novelist. A native of Chicago, Norris worked as a journalist for some years before finding success as a novelist and playwright. His first book was &quot;The Amateur&quot; (1916). His other novels include &quot;Salt&quot; (1919), &quot;Brass: A Novel of Marriage&quot; (1921), &quot;Bread&quot; (1923), &quot;Pig Iron&quot; (1926), &quot;Seed: A Novel of Birth Control&quot; (1930), &quot;Zest&quot; (1933), &quot;Hands&quot; (1935), and &quot;Flint&quot; (1944). He also published three plays: &quot;The Rout of the Philistines&quot; (with Nino Marcelli, 1922), &quot;A Gest of Robin Hood&quot; (with Robert C. Newell, 1929), and &quot;Ivanhoe: A Grove Play&quot; (1936).

== Critiques of his work ==
Norris was well-respected by his literary peers. In a letter to Alida Bigelow dated September 23, 1919, F. Scott Fitzgerald advised the young woman to &quot;read &quot;Salt&quot; young girl so that you may know what life B.&quot; (spelling is that of Fitzgerald). &quot;The Oxford Companion to American Literature&quot; notes that Norris&#x27; novels dealt with &quot;such problems as modern education, women in business, hereditary and environmental influences, big business, ethics and birth control.&quot;

== Family ==
He was the brother of novelist Frank Norris and the husband of author Kathleen Norris. His granddaughter Kathleen Norris (1 Mar. 1935, San Francisco–8 Dec. 1967, San Francisco) was married to Prince Andrew Romanoff (1923-2021).

<text>Tropico is a construction and management simulation video game developed by PopTop Software and published by Gathering of Developers in April 2001. Feral Interactive has developed and published a number of the games in the series for Mac OS X. The games see the player taking the role of &quot;El Presidente&quot;, who rules a fictional Caribbean island country named Tropico during the Cold War era and beyond.

The game is tongue-in-cheek in its presentation of semi-democratic banana republics, using a great deal of humor while still referencing such topics as totalitarianism, electoral fraud, and the interventions of powerful companies (United Fruit is implied) and the Cold War superpowers (the United States and Soviet Union). This is similar to the previous 8bit Game &quot;Dictator&quot; by DK&#x27;Tronics, except in Dictator the success is measured by the amount you put away in your Swiss bank account, which is an offshore bank account.

&quot;Tropico&quot; features Latin-styled Caribbean music, largely performed by Daniel Indart. The game won the &quot;Original Musical Composition&quot; award during the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

&quot;Tropico&quot; has several expansion packs and new editions, including &quot;Tropico: Paradise Island&quot;, plus a combined copy of the original and &quot;Paradise Island&quot; titled &quot;Tropico: Mucho Macho Edition&quot; (released on June 27, 2002). A sequel, &quot;Tropico 2: Pirate Cove&quot;, was released on April 8, 2003. The third game in the series &quot;Tropico 3&quot;, was released in the autumn of 2009. A fourth game, &quot;Tropico 4&quot;, was released on August 26, 2011, and a fifth game, &quot;Tropico 5&quot;, was released on May 23, 2014. &quot;Tropico 6&quot; was released on March 29, 2019.

The game was re-released in the three-game pack &quot;Tropico Reloaded&quot;, packing the original game, the expansion pack &quot;Tropico: Paradise Island&quot;, and the sequel &quot;Tropico 2: Pirate Cove&quot; into one release. It is available both digitally on Steam and GOG.com, and on disc.

== Gameplay ==
Regardless of any other stated victory condition, the main goal of any &quot;Tropico&quot; game is to stay in power. If the island&#x27;s populace disapproves of the player&#x27;s actions, they may vote their leader out of office. Individual factions and powers can also end or disrupt El Presidente&#x27;s rule. Rebels can defeat the army and storm the Presidential palace. If the army is dissatisfied, it can stage a coup d&#x27;état.

If &quot;El Presidente&quot; manages to stay in positive view of the Soviet Union and the United States they will supply him with foreign aid money. If either of the Cold War superpowers becomes unhappy with the player&#x27;s regime, it may launch an invasion to overthrow it. The superpowers may build a military base on Tropico, protecting the island from the other and offering monthly payments. If an army base is established in the country, it may ask for specific tasks, and low satisfaction will lead them to overthrow &quot;El Presidente&quot;.

&quot;Tropico&quot; can be played in two gameplay modes: scenario or custom game/random map. Scenarios are predetermined game conditions with defined goals that must be accomplished in order to win. The game includes several scenarios, each with a stated level of difficulty. Custom games allow virtually all starting conditions to be controlled. The player can customize the map of the island, adjusting its size and steepness to personal preference. Many other aspects of gameplay, such as political and economic difficulty, can also be customized to make the game easier or more difficult. The custom game also allows the player to choose how many game years the simulation will run for (a minimum of 10 years, a maximum of 70), and what conditions will determine victory (if any). The game also includes a tutorial level, which teaches the player the game mechanics and controls of the game.

The player is able to issue a number of governmental edicts, some of which require funding or the availability of particular buildings. Edicts are used to achieve various game effects, from appeasing one of the superpowers by openly praising them, to instating martial law or giving a tax break to the populace.

Before starting a custom game, the player may either design their own &quot;El Presidente&quot; character or select one from a list of pre-made leaders. These include real-life figures such as Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and Augusto Pinochet, fictional rulers such as Hernando Blanco and Sancho Baraega. Lou Bega, who is a pop musician commonly known at the time for the song &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;, is also available as a dictator persona. After the player has chosen a leader, the player can customize their profile by specifying the strengths and flaws of their character&#x27;s personality, the means by which they came into power and their social background. These choices affect the attitudes of factions and superpowers towards the player, and can also alter the costs or consequences of in-game actions.

The game calculates a score for the player at the end of the game. This score is based on a variety of factors, including the happiness of the island&#x27;s citizens, the health of the island&#x27;s economy, how much money the player has set aside for their retirement in a Swiss bank account, and the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the game.

=== Politics and factions ===
While &quot;El Presidente&quot; has absolute rule over the lives of the Tropican people, politics play an important role in gameplay. The player must decide whether to hold free elections, attempt to manipulate the election by intimidating voters, or to dispense with any pretense of democracy and run the island as a dictatorship. These decisions will have direct effects on the Tropican people&#x27;s happiness, liberty, and respect for the leader. Often the player is judged on &quot;democracy expectations&quot; versus &quot;democracy results&quot;, which will influence the public&#x27;s opinion of their leadership. Having free elections increases the respect of El Presidente among the population, but if their support gets too low, there is the risk of El Presidente losing the elections and being forced to resign. A successful leader will have to either meet the needs of the populace, the political factions, and the wider political world, or establish and police a totalitarian military dictatorship and watch the army carefully.

If pushed enough the Tropican people may choose to rebel against &quot;El Presidente&quot;, conducting guerrilla attacks against various buildings on the island; if the rebellion grows strong enough this will result in the overthrow of the player. A sufficiently dissatisfied military will likely instigate a coup. Often threats to power can be measured based on a unit&#x27;s leadership qualities and his courage. For example, a citizen with poor leadership but strong courage may not be likely to start a rebellion but may be willing to join it.

Most Tropicans are aligned into several conflicting political factions, with some citizens being a member of one or more such factions:

*Communists: Generally one of the larger factions, they are most concerned with adequate housing, healthcare and employment for the masses, and low pay disparities between workers on the island. They also prefer a pro-Soviet foreign policy.
*Capitalists: They stand in opposition to the communists and are a small, but influential faction. They are concerned with economic development, the provision of expensive luxuries, low crime rates for the island, and prefer a pro-American foreign policy.
*Religious: One of the larger factions on the island. This is due to the high value that many Tropicans place on their faith. They often are concerned with access to and quality of religious institutions on the island, as well as the island&#x27;s morality. Appeasing them can often result in major reductions in liberty as they are swayed by edicts such as &quot;Book BBQ&quot;, &quot;Prohibition&quot;, &quot;Birth Control Ban&quot;, and &quot;Inquisition&quot;. The religious faction tends to be led by either a priest or bishop. Having cathedrals and churches on the island encourages the growth of this faction (when citizens go to church they become more religious), but having not enough of them can keep this faction&#x27;s size down, though its few members will oppose the government.
*Intellectuals: This is one of the smallest factions on the island and tends to have the most detractors. They are most concerned with access to education as well as maintaining a standard of liberty on the island. They can be one of the hardest factions to please and occasionally pose a threat to power, especially if the player is running an authoritarian regime. Their faction is often led by a professor or teacher.
*Militarists: This is a medium-sized but powerful faction mainly concerned with the size and well-being of the island&#x27;s military. They are one of the biggest threats to power, as armed members of this faction may launch a coup against the player. Prioritizing the militarists&#x27; support may result in a decrease in liberty and can cause non-militarists to rebel. The militarist faction is generally led by a soldier or general.
*Environmentalists: A very small faction. They are most concerned with the natural beauty of the island and reducing pollution. As such, they oppose logging and mining operations as well as most industry. Often they are in direct conflict with the interests of the capitalists or the communists. The leader can appease them by building garbage dumps to contain pollution, or issuing edicts relating to the environment, such as an anti-litter ordinance, but this will generally result in increased maintenance costs and decreased productivity. They can be pleased by frequent planting of trees (which can be done along the sides of roads prior to those roads being completed).

Factions can be manipulated both positively and negatively mainly through edicts and buildings. For example, the player may choose to bribe the leaders of factions to attempt to curry their favor or, if the factions&#x27; leaders become too much of a threat, he can have them assassinated or imprisoned. The island&#x27;s media outlets can be directed to distribute propaganda for a particular faction, and schools can be either parochial or military in nature.

==Development==
The game was developed in 23 months.

=== Origin ===
The Banana Republic idea was the first of these that we agreed on. It was original, though not radical. Everyone likes building games, but the two predominant models, set out by &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;SimCity&quot;, have been cloned to death. This would be a fresh take on the building game concept. Moreover, the Latin American setting provides a rich background for the political side of the game. Building a prosperous country in and of itself is not enough – you’ve got to bribe your generals and repress your dissidents to avoid a coup-d&#x27;etat or a mass uprising.The singer Lou Bega was included as part of a licensing deal that also saw one of Bega&#x27;s songs integrated into the German release of &quot;Tropico&quot;.

===Expansion pack===
After the completion of &quot;Tropico&quot;, Steinmeyer was uninterested in developing further games in the series. However, later in 2001, Take-Two Interactive requested an expansion pack to capitalize on the game&#x27;s success.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Tropico&quot; was a commercial success; Geoff Keighley of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared it one of Gathering of Developers&#x27; few &quot;certified hits&quot;. In the United States, it claimed fifth place on NPD Intelect&#x27;s computer game sales chart for the week of April 22. It placed sixth the following two weeks, before holding at tenth for the May 13 – June 2 period. On NPD Intelect&#x27;s monthly charts, &quot;Tropico&quot; took places nine and 19 in May and June, respectively. According to NPD, the game sold 67,000 copies in the United States by October 2001.

According to Phil Steinmeyer, the game&#x27;s highest sales came from &quot;the U.S., Germany, and Britain, respectively&quot;, in its first seven weeks. He noted that &quot;Tropico&quot; did not fall from the top 10 of these markets&#x27; computer game sales charts during the period, and that it reached #1 on Germany&#x27;s chart. As of November 2007, &quot;Tropico&quot; had sold 1 million copies in total.

===Critical reviews===
John Lee of &quot;Next Generation&quot; summarized, &quot;&quot;Tropico&quot; tends to be slow, with no tedium-breaking clash of arms like other city builders, but there&#x27;s enough innovation to give it charm.&quot; In &quot;Game Informer&quot;, Kristian Brogger praised the game&#x27;s visuals, music and &quot;wonderfully intuitive camera system&quot;. He called the game &quot;an absolute must-have for anyone who found anything from &quot;SimCity&quot; to &quot;Zeus&quot; even moderately interesting.&quot;

&quot;Tropico&quot; received the &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition&quot; award from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences during the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. It also won the &quot;Best Music&quot; awards from &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and GameSpot. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s staff called the score &quot;brilliant&quot; and summarized it as &quot;easily the year&#x27;s most evocative soundtrack&quot;. &quot;Tropico&quot; was also nominated for GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;Best Single-Player Strategy Game&quot; and &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s &quot;Best Strategy Game for PC&quot; awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Civilization III&quot; and &quot;Etherlords&quot;, respectively.
===&quot;Paradise Island&quot;===

The Paradise Island expansion pack adds new in-game music, more edicts, and new buildings, especially factories and tourism-related facilities. It also acts as a patch, fixing problems in the original game release. As a result, buildings can now be rotated, fully refunded if cancelled prior to construction, and the construction process is now significantly faster.

==Trivia==
The Presidential Palace, main building of the game, is modeled after Palacio de Valle in Cuba.

==Legacy==
&quot;Tropico&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;Tropico 2: Pirate Cove&quot;, in 2003. While PopTop remained involved as the sequel&#x27;s producer, the game was developed by Frog City Software. &quot;Tropico 2&quot; was the final game in the series to be published by Take-Two Interactive. No further entries were greenlit until November 2008, when Kalypso Media bought the &quot;Tropico&quot; intellectual property from Take-Two and announced &quot;Tropico 3&quot;, developed by Bulgaria&#x27;s Haemimont Games. The game was released in 2009. Afterward, Haemimont Games developed &quot;Tropico 4&quot; (2011) and &quot;Tropico 5&quot; (2014), both published by Kalypso. &quot;Tropico 6&quot;, developed by Limbic Entertainment and published again by Kalypso Media, was announced in June 2017 and released on March 29, 2019. In December 2020, Realmforge Studios announced that it would take over its future development of the series.

<text>The is a compact executive car (D-segment in Europe) sold by Lexus, a luxury division of Toyota, since 1998. The IS was originally sold under the nameplate in Japan from 1998 (the word is Italian for &#x27;height&#x27; or &#x27;highness&#x27;). The IS was introduced as an entry-level sport model positioned below the ES in the Lexus lineup.

The first-generation Altezza (codename XE10) was launched in Japan in October 1998, while the Lexus IS 200 (GXE10) made its debut in Europe in 1999 and in North America as the IS 300 (JCE10) in 2000. The first-generation models were powered by a straight-six engine and available in sedan and wagon variants. The second-generation IS (codename XE20) was launched globally in 2005 with V6-powered IS 250 (GSE20) and IS 350 (GSE21) sedan models, followed by a high-performance V8 sedan version, the IS F, in 2007, and coupé convertible versions, the IS 250 C and IS 350 C, in 2008. The third-generation Lexus IS premiered in January 2013 and includes the V6-powered IS 350 and IS 250, turbocharged IS 200t/300, hybrid IS 300h and performance-tuned F Sport variants. The IS designation stands for &quot;Intelligent Sport&quot;.

== First generation (XE10; 1998) ==
Produced as a direct competitor to the luxury sports sedans of the leading European luxury marques, the XE10 series Toyota Altezza and Lexus IS was designed with a greater performance emphasis than typically seen on prior Japanese luxury vehicles. The engineering work was led by Nobuaki Katayama from 1994 to 1998 under the 038T program code, who was responsible for the AE86 project. Design work which had been done in 1995 by Tomoyasu Nishi was frozen in 1996 and filed under patent number 1030135 on 5 December 1996, at the Japan Patent Office. At its introduction to Japan, it was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called &quot;Toyota Netz Store&quot;, until Lexus was introduced to Japan in 2006. The Japan-sold AS200 Altezza sedan and AS300 Altezza Gita correspond to the Lexus IS 200 and IS 300 models respectively, as sold in markets outside of Japan. The Lexus IS&#x27; primary markets were North America, Australia, and Europe. The Altezza Gita was a hatchback-station wagon version sold in Japan and was known in the US and Europe as the Lexus IS SportCross. The AS300 Altezza Gita was the only Altezza with the 2JZ-GE engine; in export markets this engine was available in the sedan models as well as the Lexus IS300 Sedan.

=== 1998–2000 ===
Introduced in 1998 with the AS200 (chassis code GXE10) and RS200 (chassis code SXE10) sedans, the compact vehicle was produced using a shortened, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive midsize platform, allowing Japanese buyers to take advantage of tax savings imposed by Japanese government regulations concerning vehicle engine displacement (but not exterior dimensions, as the car was 20 mm wider than the 1,700 mm standard), and adapted parts from the larger second-generation Aristo/GS. The 2.0-litre &quot;1G-FE&quot; straight-six powered AS200 (GXE10, sedan) was equipped with a four-speed automatic as standard. The 2.0-litre &quot;3S-GE&quot; straight-four-powered RS200 (SXE10, sedan) was equipped a six-speed manual transmission, while a five-speed automatic was optional. 

The design received critical acclaim at its 1998 launch and was awarded Japan&#x27;s &quot;Car of the Year&quot; honor for 1998–1999. A few months later, Lexus began marketing the IS 200 equivalent models in Europe. The IS 200 in Europe was rated at , with a top speed of , and acceleration time of 9.3 seconds. The styling cues of the rear lamp clusters on the first-generation models were copied by a number of after-market accessory manufacturers for applications on other vehicles. This iconic style of one or more internal lamp units, covered with a clear (or tinted) perspex cover made popular by Lexus, became known in many circles as &#x27;Lexus-style&#x27; or &#x27;Altezza lights&#x27;. The taillight style became so popular, that it influenced the development of clear-covered LED taillamps that only revealed their colour when illuminated. The XE10&#x27;s chief engineer was Nobuaki Katayama, while the chief test driver and test engineer was Hiromu Naruse.

=== 2000–2003 ===
In July 2000, a hatchback/station wagon model, the AS300 (chassis code JCE10), was introduced featuring a 3.0-litre &quot;2JZ-GE&quot; straight-six engine. Equipped with rear- or all-wheel drive (JCE10, RWD Gita wagon; JCE15, 4WD Gita wagon), the AS300 was only available with an automatic gearbox; a five-speed automatic for the RWD Gita wagon and a four-speed automatic for the 4WD Gita wagon. The six-cylinder version (&quot;2JZ-GE&quot;) was only available in Japan on the Gita models. Additionally, a six-speed manual transmission was introduced to the AS200 (chassis code GXE10). In the US, the IS 300 sedan debuted in July 2000 as 2001 model and the wagon debuted in 2001 as a 2002 model with the same 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine (the 2.0-litre six-cylinder was not available), while in Europe, the IS 300 joined the IS 200 in the model lineup. The IS 300 models were initially only available with the five-speed automatic transmission in all markets. A five-speed manual – the six-speed manual from the 2-liter model was not designed for the torque put out by the larger 2JZ-GE engine – was made available in the US in 2001 for the 2002 model year. The manual option was not available on the SportCross wagon. Lexus aimed for 15 percent of American IS 300 sales to be manuals. Visually the exterior of the European IS 200 Sport and 300 were almost identical, the only differences being the boot insignia and the larger-engined model initially having clear front indicators (later generalized throughout the range).

The first-generation IS&#x27; interior featured unique elements not typically found in other Lexus models. These included a chrome metal ball shifter (USDM &amp; European market, other markets received an optional leather-trimmed shifter), (optional) pop-up navigation screen, and chronograph-style instrument panel (with mini gauges for temperature, fuel economy, and volts). For the European and Australian markets, the IS 300 gained full leather seats rather than the leather/ecsaine of the 200, plus Auto-dimming rear view and side mirrors, and HID headlamps. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency listed the IS 300 as a subcompact car; although it technically had enough overall volume to be called a compact, rear seat room exhibited subcompact dimensions.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2001 gave the IS 300 the maximum five stars in the Side Driver and Side Rear Passenger categories, and four stars in the Frontal Driver and Frontal Passenger categories. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the IS &quot;Good&quot; overall for frontal collisions and &quot;Good&quot; in all six measured front impact categories.

For the first-generation IS in the North American market, sales hit a high of 22,486 units in 2001; subsequent sales years were less than forecast, and below the 10,000-unit mark in 2004. The IS 200 fared better relative to sales targets in Europe and Asia, while still well short of the sales volume achieved by the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and other, mostly German-made competitors. This trend was indicative of Lexus&#x27; smaller global status; while Lexus&#x27; range of cars was very successful in North America, the marque&#x27;s sales lagged behind its German rivals in Europe. In Europe, the lack of a manual gearbox option for the IS 300 may have limited sales in contrast to its rivals, the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes C-Class.

In 2000, TTE introduced a compressor kit for the IS 200 in the European market. An Eaton supercharger at 0.3-bar pressure increased the power output to without sacrificing fuel consumption (+3.3%). The kit was initially available as an aftermarket fitment, but could also be obtained as OEM Lexus accessory on newer cars through the official Lexus dealer network and was fully covered by the standard warranty. This variant was discontinued when the IS 300 was introduced in the European market.

=== 2003–2005 ===

In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the IS line received a minor facelift (designed by Hiroyuki Tada). On the exterior, was a redesigned 11-spoke wheel design, redesigned fog lamps, and smoked surrounding trim for the headlamps and taillamps. On the interior, a 2-position memory function was added for the driver seat, a maintenance indicator lamp, automatic drive-away door locking system, a storage compartment on the dash (for models without the navigation system) and updated trim highlights.

An official concept model, the MillenWorks-built Lexus IS 430 was unveiled at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2003. The IS 430 prototype was an IS 300 fitted with a 4.3-litre V8 from the GS 430. Lexus dubbed the IS 430 a one-off with no plans for production. In Europe, Toyota Team Europe (TTE) installed a supercharged 4.3-litre V8 into an IS 300 bodyshell, the result was a ECE sedan.

=== Powertrain and models ===

== Second generation (XE20; 2005) ==
=== 2005–2008 ===
The second-generation of the IS was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005 as a pre-production model, with the production version debuting at the 2005 New York International Auto Show that April. Sales of the sedan began worldwide in September and October 2005 as a 2006 model, with the Toyota Altezza name discontinued due to the introduction of the Lexus marque in Japan, and the slow-selling &quot;SportCross&quot; station wagon version discontinued from the lineup altogether.

The second-generation IS marked the next introduction of Lexus&#x27; L-finesse design philosophy on a production vehicle, following the premiere of the 2006 GS executive sedan. The sedan&#x27;s exterior design featured sleeker, coupé-like contours, a fastback profile, and a repeated arrowhead motif in the front fascia and side windows. The IS sedan has a .

Production of the sedan commenced in September 2005 at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, supplemented in October 2005 with the Tahara plant at Tahara, Aichi. Production of the IS F started in December 2007 at Tahara. The facility at Miyata began manufacture of the IS C in April 2009.

=== IS F ===
In North America, IS models sold at launch included the IS 250 and IS 350 sedans; in parts of Europe, the IS models sold by Lexus included the IS 250 and IS 220d sedans. The IS 250 was also available in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chile (automatic only), South Africa and South Korea.

All second-generation IS models offered a more typical Lexus interior compared to the previous generation with a focus on luxurious amenities. The interior is equipped memory leather seats, lightsaber-like electroluminescent instrument display lighting and LED interior lighting accents, the choice of faux-metallic or optional Bird&#x27;s Eye Maple wood trim (aluminium composite on the IS F), and SmartAccess keyless entry with push-button start. Options ranged from touchscreen navigation with backup camera to a Mark Levinson premium sound system and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.

On 6 December 2006, Lexus officially confirmed the existence of a high-performance variant of the second-generation IS called the IS F. The Lexus IS F sedan (USE20) premiered at the 2007 North American International Auto Show on 8 January 2007 as the launch product of Lexus&#x27; F marque lineup of performance-focused vehicles. The IS F went on sale several months later in North America and Europe. The IS F was capable of accelerating from in 4.2 seconds, and had an electronically limited top speed of .

The introduction of the second-generation IS model marked a resurgence in sales for the IS line, with a 332% increase overall in 2006 compared to the previous year. In its first year of sales, the IS sold over 49,000 units, making it one of the ten best-selling luxury cars in the US. The IS line later took a median position in the entry-luxury market; in 2008 it sold behind the variants of the BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Cadillac CTS, and ahead of the Acura TL, Audi A4, and Infiniti G sedan. Outside the US, the Lexus IS spearheaded Lexus&#x27; growing sales efforts in Europe, Australia, and South Africa, becoming the best-selling model in Lexus&#x27; lineup in many of the aforementioned markets. In the US, as of 2011, the Lexus IS was the third place best-selling vehicle from the marque after the Lexus RX and Lexus ES.

=== 2008–2010 ===
In 2008, the IS line received a facelift, and the suspension and steering were retuned for improved stability and control. After three years with only one body style, the IS returned with a second body style, this time as a coupé convertible, on 2 October 2008 when the IS 250 C debuted at the Paris Motor Show. A more powerful IS 350 C also became available, with engine specifications analogous to those on the sedan models. The IS convertible went on sale in Europe in 2009, in North America in May 2009, and an IS 300 C was also produced for certain regions. The mid-cycle refresh in 2008 saw slight styling revisions to the interior.

=== 2010–2013 ===
In 2010, coinciding with the second IS line refresh, the revised diesel IS 220d was detuned for improved fuel consumption figures but lowered power output by . Building on its &quot;F Sport&quot; line of parts and accessories for the IS 250/350, Lexus added factory-produced F Sport IS models in 2010. This facelift also includes further interior updates for the IS line.

=== 2013–2015 ===
Changes to the IS C include Intelligent Transport Systems and Dedicated Short Range Communication units become standard equipment. Change to US model of F SPORT Package includes revised silver metallic interior trim. Change to Japan F SPORT Package includes dark rose interior colour, medium silver ornament panel.

Japan models went on sale on 5 September 2013. US models went on sale as 2014 model year vehicle.

=== Safety ===
Safety equipment on the IS models ranged from multiple airbags to stability control systems. A Pre-Collision System (PCS) was the first offered in the entry-luxury performance sedan market segment. NHTSA crash test results rated the second-generation IS the maximum five stars in the Side Driver and Rollover categories, and four stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Rear Passenger categories; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety scores were &quot;Good&quot; overall score for all fourteen measured categories in the front and side impact crash tests.

=== Powertrains ===

The IS 250, IS 350 and IS F are equipped with a D-4 (IS250) or D-4S (IS350 and IS F) direct injection system with direct fuel injectors (D-4 and D-4S) and port fuel injectors (D-4S only). Certain Asian markets have the IS 300 (GSE22) model without direct injection.

== Third generation (XE30; 2013) ==


=== Concept model ===

The LF-CC concept unveiled at the 2012 Paris Motor Show and later Auto Shanghai 2013 is a rear-wheel drive coupé incorporating designs from LF-LC concept and Lexus LFA. Main features include a 2.5-litre four-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine with D-4S direct injection technology, water-cooled permanent magnet electric motor, 3 LED-projector headlamp design, Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) integrated into the upper bumper surface, rear spoiler integrated within the boot lid, L-shaped combination lamps with three-dimensional design, Fluid Titanium body colour, 2-zone dashboard, seats, door panels and instrument binnacle hood upholstered in amber leather.

=== 2013–2016 ===
The production version of the IS was introduced at the North American International Auto Show in January 2013, followed by the 2013 Auto Shanghai. Exterior design work was done by Masanari Sakae during 2010–2011 and the F Sport models were styled by Yuki Isogai in 2011. For the car&#x27;s third generation, Lexus also hinted at a revival for the IS SportCross station wagon, but that didn&#x27;t end up happening.

The IS F Sport models include enhanced handling and performance, Adaptive Variable Suspension and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (IS 350). Not only do the F Sport
models handle differently, but they are more aggressively styled to set them apart from the base production models. F-Sport styling includes an edition specific F-Sport pattern front grille, F-Sport logo badges, and five spoke split graphite wheels; the cabin includes carbon fibre-like trim, extra bolstered performance seats, an all-black headliner, and a moving vessel gauge cluster (inspired by the Lexus LFA) that displays navigation and audio information. The F-Sport models have an edition specific Ultra White exterior and Rioja Red interior. The 2014 model year also served as the first year to offer all-wheel drive in the IS F Sport line up.

International models went on sale in mid-2013. Early models included the IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 300h and IS 350 RWD. The hybrid IS 300h model is sold in Europe, Japan, and select international markets.

US models went on sale as 2014 model year vehicles on 28 June 2013. Early models include IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 350 RWD, IS 350 AWD. In 2015, for the 2016 model year, the IS 250 was discontinued and replaced by the rear wheel drive only IS 200t. The IS 300 is only offered with all-wheel drive, while the top-of-the-line IS 350 can be ordered with either drivetrain. The IS AWD versions use a full-time all-wheel drive system that utilizes a planetary gearset center differential coupled with a multi-disc clutch to act as the slip limiting device. The planetary gearset provides a 30:70 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions for handling agility, however the system can allow for a torque split of up to 50:50 to control wheel slip. In August 2017, for the 2018 model year, the IS 300 RWD changed to using the 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine from the previous IS 200t while the IS 300 AWD retained the same 3.5-litre V6 engine.

Chinese models went on sale in 2013. Early models include the IS 250 and the IS 250 F Sport.

Japanese models went on sale on 16 May 2013. Early models include the IS 250, IS 250 AWD, IS 350 and the IS 300h.

Australian models went on sale in July 2013. Only rear-wheel-drive versions were on offer, the models included the IS 250, IS 300h and the IS 350. The IS 250 was dropped from the line-up in September 2015 and was replaced with the IS 200t.

=== 2017 facelift ===
The revamped third generation model includes updated headlamps, taillamps, front fascia and hood. It debuted at the April 2016 Beijing Auto Show with interior technology improvements including 10.3 inch infotainment screen, updated steering wheel, and contrast stitching along the dash.

The Lexus IS receives subtle updates in 2017, for the 2018 model year. Most notably, its V-6 engines get a 5-hp power increase, and the rear-drive, inline-four-powered IS200t is now called the IS300. Joining the options list is adaptive front lighting, which turns the headlights with the steering wheel to improve visibility. The F Sport performance trim now includes a standard limited-slip rear differential, but only in the top-tier rear-drive IS350.

=== 2020 facelift ===
The IS received a major makeover in 2020 for the 2021 model year. The updated styling includes a larger bodywork, restyled headlamps and full-width taillamps, slightly updated dashboard, and a larger spindle grille design. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capabilities were made available, as well as upgraded driver-assistance systems and standard blind-spot monitoring. The suspension has also been revised with a more rigid body. In the United States, the F Sport trim is only available on the top IS350 model with its 3.5-liter V-6.

Dynamic Handling Package (DHP), which includes Adaptive Variable Suspension, lighter 19-inch black BBS alloy wheels, Sport S and Sport S+ drive select modes, and carbon fibre rear spoiler, is available for the IS 350 F Sport.

Following the introduction of stricter crash safety regulations, the IS, along with the CT hatchback and the RC coupe, were pulled out from the Australian market in November 2021. The IS, along with the CT and RC, was discontinued in Europe in 2020 due to poor sales figures, fierce competition from European rivals, and a shift in the market towards Crossover SUVs.

==== IS 500 F Sport Performance ====
In February 2021, for the 2022 model year, the first V8-powered model since the IS F, called the IS 500 F Sport Performance, was unveiled and went on sale exclusively in North America in the third quarter of 2021. The IS 500 F Sport Performance is offered rear-wheel drive only and features the same 5.0 L (4,969 cc) &quot;2UR-GSE&quot; engine offered in the IS F, RC F, GS F, and LC 500, rated at 472 horsepower and 395 lb⋅ft of torque in this version. This is the first Lexus model classified as &quot;F Sport Performance&quot;, signifying a new class of model that offers the power output and engine of higher &quot;F&quot; marque models, but without the wider body, interior appointments such as sport bucket seats, nor extensively upgraded and tuned brakes, suspension, and chassis.

Distinguishing it from other IS F Sport models, the IS 500 F Sport Performance includes a raised hood bulge for the larger V8 engine, stacked quad exhaust tips, Yamaha rear performance dampers, F Sport–tuned Adaptive Variable Suspension, two-piece aluminum 14.0-in front and 12.7-in rear brake rotors, dark chrome window trim, F Sport Performance front door-sill scuff plates, IS 500 startup animation in multi-information display, and F Sport Performance 19-in staggered-width split-10-spoke Enkei alloy wheels, with optional 19-in split-seven-spoke forged alloy Matte Black BBS wheels. For 2023, the IS 500 F Sport Performance Premium offers an exclusive Special Appearance Package with Molten Pearl exterior paint, Black NuLuxe interior, 19-inch Matte Black BBS forged alloy wheels, unique color-matched floor-trimmed mats and matching key gloves.

== Motorsport ==
The first-generation IS 200/300 and RS200 series was used by many racing teams, including Toyota Racing Development, Endless, TOM&#x27;S, APEXi, and Amuse to race in various touring car racing series across Asia, including an Altezza one-make racing series in Japan. In Europe, the Lexus IS 200 was raced in the British Touring Car Championship (through organizations such as BTC Racing), and the IS 300 was raced in the US via the Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Championship touring car series (with the manufacturer-sanctioned Team Lexus).

In 2001, Team Lexus entered three IS 300s in the third race of the 2001 Grand-Am Cup season at Phoenix, Arizona, and won their first IS 300 victory that year at the Virginia International Raceway. In 2002, Team Lexus raced the IS 300 in the Grand-Am Cup ST1 (Street Tuner) class, winning both the Drivers&#x27; and Team Championships, as well as a sweep of the top three finishes at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, Canada.

In 2008, the second-generation IS 350 was entered in the Super GT race series in the GT300 class (cars with approximately ). The No. 19 Racing Project Bandoh IS 350 driven by Manabu Orido and Tsubasa Abe achieved its first victory in its fifth race at the Motegi GT300 race. In 2009, The Project Bandoh WedsSport IS 350, driven by Manabu Orido and Tatsuya Kataoka, won both driver and team title in the GT300 class that season.

In April 2009, a Lexus IS F entered by Gazoo Racing finished second to the team&#x27;s Lexus LF-A in the SP8 class in the ADAC-Westfalenfahrt VLN 4h endurance race. An IS F was also entered in the 2009 24 Hours Nürburgring race and finished third in the SP8 class. In August 2009, an IS F entered by Gazoo Racing and driven by Peter Lyon, Hideshi Matsuda, and Kazunori Yamauchi won the SP8 class at the DMV Grenzlandrennen VLN race. Kazunori Yamauchi is the developer of &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, of which the IS line is playable in several versions, and the IS F racer carried test equipment for future game modes. The 3 drivers, along with Owen Mildenhall, participated in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring and finished in 4th place in the SP8 class, behind the 1st place ranked Lexus LFA.

In 2012, Japanese drift racer Daigo Saito entered an IS 250 C in the Formula Drift Asia series. The car, which was a victim of the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami and due to be scrapped, was purchased by Saito and heavily customized for drift racing use. The most notable modification was the swapping of the stock engine to a 2JZ-GTE from a 4th generation Toyota Supra.

<text>The Buster Posey Award, formerly known as the Johnny Bench Award, was created in 2000 to honor college baseball&#x27;s top catcher in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division I. The award is administered by the Wichita Sports Commission and presented after the conclusion of the College World Series.

Originally named for Johnny Bench, it was renamed in 2019 after Johnny Bench announced the creation of his own national award for amateur catchers. The commission reviewed the statistics of the prior winners and unanimously chose to rename the award after Buster Posey.

Schools nominate their catchers during the season to create the official watch list. A select committee of 20 individuals narrows the watch list down to the semifinalists. Two rounds of voting by Division I head coaches determine the three finalists and eventual recipient of the Buster Posey Award. The current holder of the award is Walker Janek.

<text>Lieutenant-General Charles Willoughby Moke Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie, (26 September 1893 – 25 May 1977), was a senior officer of the British Army who fought in both World Wars, following which he served terms as Governor of South Australia and the eighth Governor-General of New Zealand.

==Military career==
===Early career and First World War===
Educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the British Army&#x27;s 11th Hussars in 1913. He served in the First World War, in which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Military Cross and Bar, was twice mentioned in despatches, and was wounded four times. He became, successively, a Staff Captain in the 73rd Brigade; General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) in XVIII Corps; brigade major in the 90th Brigade, and in the 2nd Tank Brigade; and second GSO in the 2nd Battalion, Tank Corps. In January 1919 he changed his name by deed poll from Moke-Norrie to Norrie.

===Between the wars===
Between the world wars Norrie had a number of regimental and staff postings, interrupted by a year at the Staff College, Camberley in 1924. In 1931 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became Commanding Officer (CO) of the 10th Hussars, after which he was placed on the half-pay (inactive) list although promoted to full colonel in 1935. In January 1936, still on the half pay list, Norrie took part in the funeral procession for King George V as one of the &quot;Representative Colonels-Commandant and Colonels of His late Majesty&#x27;s Regiments&quot;. After attending the Imperial Defence College, in April 1936 he was appointed to command the 1st Cavalry Brigade as a temporary brigadier. His brigade was mechanised in 1938 and re-designated 1st Light Armoured Brigade, becoming the 1st Armoured Brigade in 1940.

===Second World War===
On the outbreak of the Second World War Norrie continued to serve as commander of the 1st Armoured Brigade. In April 1940 the brigade was part of the 2nd Armoured Division, which he was given temporary command of for a month between appointments of permanent commanders. Following this he was appointed acting major general and became Inspector of the Royal Armoured Corps. Four months later he became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 1st Armoured Division and was promoted to the permanent rank of major general in June 1941.

In November 1941 the division was ordered to Egypt where Norrie found himself appointed acting lieutenant general to command XXX Corps in the place of Vyvyan Pope, Norrie&#x27;s fellow student at the Staff College in the 1920s, who had died in an air crash shortly before Norrie&#x27;s arrival in Egypt. He commanded XXX Corps during Operation Crusader with some success but his tanks suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Gazala in June 1942. He was criticised for his &quot;cavalry&quot; approach to armoured warfare and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, the Eighth Army commander, replaced him in July.

He returned to Britain to be appointed Commander of the Royal Armoured Corps in which role he was to give advice on armoured warfare to General Bernard Paget, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. He continued as Paget&#x27;s advisor when Paget became commander of the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group on its formation in July 1943 but when General Bernard Montgomery assumed command early in 1944, he brought his own advisor. In April 1944 Norrie was appointed Head of the Military Mission to the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN) in Algiers, a post he held until the middle of 1944 when he was proposed by the Secretary of State for the Dominions to become Governor of South Australia.

Norrie retired from the British Army in September 1944 to take up his post as Governor of South Australia. Although his substantive rank at this time was still major general, he was given the honorary rank of lieutenant general in retirement.

==Family==
Norrie was married to Jocelyn Helen Gosling on 9 June 1922. They had three children:
Diana Norrie (7 May 1923 – 6 December 1932);
Hon. Rosemary Norrie (born 28 March 1926), who married the 3rd Viscount Daventry; and
George Willoughby Moke Norrie (born 27 April 1936).

Jocelyn Norrie died on 7 March 1938. Norrie then married, on 28 November that year, Patricia Merryweather Bainbridge, daughter of Emerson Bainbridge. They also had three children:
Guy Bainbridge Norrie (born 3 May 1940),
Sarah Norrie (born 27 June 1943), and
Annabel Mary Adelaide Norrie (born 23 December 1945).

Norrie also had a ward, his niece Eleanor Kerans (born 21 April 1926). She had been orphaned at an early age; when she was 16 her brother was killed in the Western Desert campaign of the Second World War, leaving her with no immediate family.

==Governor of South Australia==

Norrie was appointed Governor of South Australia in September 1944, whereupon he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). He, his family and 12 staff arrived in Adelaide in December. The Vice-Regal couple worked hard to keep the &#x27;Empire Spirit&#x27; alive during wartime. Within two years, Norrie had travelled to every local government area within the state, and was sure to welcome servicemen returning from war. Lady Patricia, with Rosemary and Eleanor, were regular volunteers and champions of various patriotic causes. In 1945, Norrie was made a Knight of St John, an award associated with public and charitable works.

Although normally remaining neutral in regards to local politics, he was &#x27;shocked&#x27; at the narrow rejection of Thomas Playford&#x27;s bill to nationalise the Adelaide Electric Company. He privately exerted pressure on the bill&#x27;s main opponents. When the bill was reintroduced in 1946, Collier Cudmore (later Sir Collier) absented himself from key divisions, allowing the bill to pass and leading to the establishment of the Electricity Trust of South Australia.

Norrie&#x27;s term was extended for four years in 1948. Despite his illustrious career, he would forever claim that his greatest achievement was the catching of a shark weighing , with rod and reel, off Port Lincoln. For part of his term as governor, his official aide-de-camp was the young Viscount Althorp (later The 8th Earl Spencer), the father of Diana, Princess of Wales.

==Governor-General of New Zealand==

Norrie&#x27;s KCMG was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) when he was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand in 1952, in which position he served until 1957. During his tenure he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) for personal services to The Queen. On leaving office, he was created a peer in 1957 as Baron Norrie, of Wellington in the Dominion of New Zealand and of Upton in the County of Gloucester. From 1960 to 1968 he was Chancellor of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

<doc id="762040" wikidata="Q5159268" url="?curid=762040" title="Conditional loop">
<text>In computer programming, conditional loops or repetitive control structures are a way for computer programs to repeat one or more various steps depending on conditions set either by the programmer initially or real-time by the actual program.

A conditional loop has the potential to become an infinite loop when nothing in the loop&#x27;s body can affect the outcome of the loop&#x27;s conditional statement. However, infinite loops can sometimes be used purposely, often with an exit from the loop built into the loop implementation for every computer language, but many share the same basic structure and/or concept. The While loop and the For loop are the two most common types of conditional loops in most programming languages.

==Types==
The following types are written in C++, but apply to multiple languages.

===While loop===
Checks condition for truthfulness before executing any of the code in the loop. If condition is initially false, the code inside the loop will never be executed. In PL/I this is a codice_1 statement.
while (condition) {
 // code


===Do-While loop===
Checks condition for truthfulness after executing the code in the loop. Therefore, the code inside the loop will always be executed at least once. PL/I implements this as a codice_2 statement.
do {
 // code
} while (condition);
===For loop===
A simplified way to create a while loop.
for (initialization; condition; statement) {
 // code


Initialization is executed just once before the loop. Condition evaluates the boolean expression of the loop. Statement is executed at the end of every loop.

So for example, the following while loop:
int i = 0;

while (i &lt; 10) {
 // code
 i += 1;


Could be written as the following for loop:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
 // code


===For-Each loop===
A for-each loop is essentially equivalent to an iterator. It allows a program to iterate through a data structure without having to keep track of an index. It is especially useful in Sets which do not have indices. An example is as follows:
std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; range = { &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot; };

for (auto item: range) {
 // code


==Examples==
The following is a C-style While loop. It continues looping while x does not equal 3, or in other words it only stops looping when x equals 3. However, since x is initialized to 0 and the value of x is never changed in the loop, the loop will never end (infinite loop).

int x = 0;

while (x != 3) {
 // code that doesn&#x27;t change x

The while loop below will execute the code in the loop 5 times. x is initialized to 0, and each time in the loop the value of x is incremented. The while loop is set up to stop when x is equal to 5.

int x = 0;

while (x != 5) {
 // code
 x += 1;


==Frequent bugs==
Conditional loops are often the source of an Off by one error.

<text>In economics and in particular neoclassical economics, the marginal product or marginal physical productivity of an input (factor of production) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm&#x27;s labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed 
as:
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the change in the firm&#x27;s use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and formula_3 is the change in the quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity formula_4 of the &quot;product&quot; is typically defined ignoring external costs and benefits.

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal &quot;units&quot; are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical derivative of the production function with respect to that input. Suppose a firm&#x27;s output &quot;Y&quot; is given by the production function:
:formula_5

where &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are inputs to production (say, capital and labor, respectively). Then the marginal product of capital (&quot;MPK&quot;) and marginal product of labor (&quot;MPL&quot;) are given by:

:formula_6

:formula_7

In the law of diminishing marginal returns, the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has &quot;decreased&quot; the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing marginal productivity of labor.

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the total product curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of competitive markets, the marginal product of labor equals the real wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good, the marginal product of capital equals its rate of return. As was shown in the Cambridge capital controversy, this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

== Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP) ==

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

<text>Thomas Patrick Ashe (; 12 January 1885 – 25 September 1917) was an Irish revolutionary and politician. He was a member of the Gaelic League, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and a founding member of the Irish Volunteers.

He was a senior commander in the Easter Rising of 1916. After release from prison just over a year later he was soon re-arrested on separate charges of sedition, and died as a result of forcible feeding whilst on hunger strike in prison.

==Background==
Thomas Ashe was born in the townland of Kinard East, Lispole, Dingle, County Kerry, Ireland, to Gregory Ashe (d. 1927), a farmer, and his wife Ellen Hanifin, on 12 January 1885, according to his baptismal record and his sister Nora, or 15 March 1885, according to state birth records. His was a family of ten, seven boys and three girls. Thomas was the seventh child, with three brothers following him. His mother died aged 58, some years before Thomas died. Both Irish and English were spoken in their house, with Thomas&#x27;s father being a great Irish Scholar and learners of Irish used to come to listen to his stories.

Having entered De La Salle Training College, Waterford, in 1905 he began his teaching career as principal of Corduff National School, Lusk, County Dublin, in 1908. He taught Irish in Corduff school. He was fond of the Irish language and started branches of the Gaelic League in Skerries and other neighbouring villages. According to his sister Nora he would get the children to march over a Union Jack. Ashe was a member of the Irish National Teachers Organisation.

He spent his last years before his death teaching children in Lusk, where he founded the award-winning Lusk Black Raven Pipe Band, as well as Round Towers Lusk Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) Club, in 1906.

==Prior to the rising==

Ashe joined the Irish Volunteers upon its foundation in November 1913. He was a member of the Keating Branch of the Gaelic League and the Lusk company of the volunteers and probably founded it. He sat on the governing body of the Gaelic League, and collected considerable sums of money during a trip to the US in 1914 for both the Volunteers and the League.

Ashe supported the striking workers during the 1913 Dublin Lockout, saying &quot;We are all here on Larkin&#x27;s side. He’ll beat the hell out of the snobbish, mean, seoinín employers yet, and more power to him&quot;

==Easter Rising==
Commanding the Fingal battalion (5th battalion) of the Irish Volunteers, Ashe took a major part in the 1916 Easter Rising outside the capital city. Ashe was commandant of 5th battalion of the Dublin brigade; a force of 60–70 men engaged British forces around north County Dublin during the rising. Ashe was sent a messenger Mollie Adrian by Pearse with orders to hold the main road from Fairyhouse. She was sent back to report to Connolly, who returned an order to send 40 men to the GPO. Ashe was only able to send 20 due to his shortage of men.

He was to contact the 1st battalion at Cross Guns Bridge, although he found no one there because vice-commandant Piaras Beaslai knew nothing of this plan. The area was dominated by the central feature of Broadstone station, at the end of the line to Athlone, an important British army barracks. But for some reason they decided not to occupy and garrison the station; similarly the Citizens Army had been confusingly required to withdraw from Mallin. The lack of cooperative communication was later discussed in Piaras Beaslai&#x27;s books, the research for which included taking accounts from Thomas Ashe whilst they were incarcerated. The failure of inexperienced volunteers to properly co-ordinate their deployments was a critical factor in defeat. Ashe himself had only been appointed commandant shortly before Easter. They were armed only with a few rounds, about a dozen service rifles, a dozen Mausers, and a dozen Martini carbines; some had only a shotgun against well-equipped army regulars.

The battalion won a major victory at the Battle of Ashbourne, County Meath where they engaged a much larger force capturing a significant quantity of arms and up to 20 Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) vehicles. Eleven RIC members, including County Inspector Alexander Gray, and two volunteers were killed during the five-and-a-half-hour battle. Twenty-four hours after the rising collapsed, Ashe&#x27;s battalion surrendered on the orders of Patrick Pearse.

When he received the order to surrender he had his doubts as he had difficulty believing the rebels in Dublin had not had success as he did. He sent Richard Mulcahy to Dublin to verify its authenticity.

On 8 May 1916, Ashe and Éamon de Valera were court-martialled and both were sentenced to death. The sentences were commuted to penal servitude for life. Ashe was imprisoned in the Frongoch internment camp and Lewes Prison in England. While in prison he wrote the poem &quot;Let Me Carry Your Cross for Ireland, Lord&quot;.
With the entry of the US into World War I in April 1917, the British government was put under more pressure to solve the &quot;Irish problem&quot;. De Valera, Ashe and Thomas Hunter led a prisoner hunger strike on 28 May 1917 to add to this pressure. With accounts of prison mistreatment appearing in the Irish press and mounting protests in Ireland, Ashe and the remaining prisoners were freed on 18 June 1917 by Lloyd George as part of a general amnesty.

==Death and legacy==
Ashe was released from jail in June 1917 under the general amnesty which was given to republican prisoners. Upon release, Ashe returned to Ireland and began a series of speaking engagements. In August 1917, Ashe was arrested and charged with sedition for a speech that he made in Ballinalee, County Longford, where Michael Collins had also been speaking. He went on the run but was captured in Dublin and detained at the Curragh but was then transferred to Mountjoy Prison in Dublin.

He was convicted on the sedition charge and sentenced to two years hard labour. Ashe and other prisoners, including other Kerrymen Fionán Lynch and Austin Stack, demanded prisoner of war status. The Lord Mayor of Dublin Laurence O&#x27;Neill visited Ashe in prison and said Ashe asked for no privileges but refused to be treated as a criminal. As this protest evolved, Ashe again went on hunger strike on 20 September 1917. As this was a breach of prison discipline, the authorities retaliated by taking away the prisoners&#x27; beds, bedding and boots. After five or six days lying on a cold stone floor, the prisoners were subjected to forcible feeding.

On 25 September, Fionán Lynch saw Ashe being carried away to receive this treatment and called out to him, &quot;Stick it Tom&quot;. Ashe called back, &quot;I&#x27;ll stick it, Fin&quot;. That was the last time they spoke to each other. Ashe was carried back, blue in the face and unconscious. He was removed to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital (which faces the prison), where he died within a few hours.

At the inquest into his death, the jury condemned the staff at the prison for the &quot;inhuman and dangerous operation performed on the prisoner, and other acts of unfeeling and barbaric conduct&quot;. They concluded that Ashe had died of heart failure and congestion of the lungs, and that this was due to force-feeding combined with the previous removal of his bed and boots (which had left him in a physically weakened state).

The death of Ashe and the subsequent funeral procession had a striking effect on the attitude of the Irish people and became a rallying call to the standard of the Irish Republic. Ashe was given a military funeral and a volley of shots was fired over his coffin, following which Michael Collins declared &quot;Nothing additional remains to be said, that volley which we have just heard is the only speech which it is proper to make above the grave of a dead Fenian&quot;. Though not on the scale of Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa&#x27;s funeral two years previous, the military aspect of the funeral proved that the Irish Volunteers were well on their way to being restored to pre-1916 levels.

Ashe&#x27;s remains were removed to the Pro-Cathedral on Thursday evening and placed on a catafalque in the main entrance. Requiem Mass was celebrated by Fr. Michael O&#x27;Flanagan on Friday morning before removal to City Hall, where his body lay in state for two days. &quot;Tom Ashe&#x27;s body lay in state in the City Hall, dressed in his Volunteer Republican uniform, and 30,000 mourners filed by.&quot;
On 30 September 1917, the funeral procession of over 30,000 marched to Glasnevin Cemetery. Michael Collins delivered the funeral eulogy in Irish and English, following the firing of a volley by uniformed Irish Volunteers. The English eulogy being &quot;nothing additional remains to be said. That volley which we have just heard is the only speech which is proper to make above the grave of a dead Fenian&quot;.

He was related to American actor Gregory Peck.

In 2017 a statue of Ashe was unveiled outside Round Towers GAA in Lusk. In the same town there is a &#x27;Thomas Ashe Park&#x27;.

The Ashe Memorial Hall in Tralee, County Kerry was named after him. The words &quot;Halla Tomáis Ághas&quot; are embossed on the front of the building. Nearby Ashe Street (formerly Nelson Street) is also named for him.

<doc id="762047" wikidata="Q2890135" url="?curid=762047" title="Freshwater ecosystem">
<text>Freshwater ecosystems are a subset of Earth&#x27;s aquatic ecosystems that include the biological communities inhabiting freshwater waterbodies such as lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, springs, bogs, and wetlands. They can be contrasted with marine ecosystems, which have a much higher salinity. Freshwater habitats can be classified by different factors, including temperature, light penetration, nutrients, and vegetation.

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems: lentic (slow moving water, including pools, ponds, and lakess), lotic (faster moving streams, for example creeks and rivers) and wetlands (semi-aquatic areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time). Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world&#x27;s known fish species.

Freshwater ecosystems have undergone substantial transformations over time, which has impacted various characteristics of the ecosystems. Original attempts to understand and monitor freshwater ecosystems were spurred on by threats to human health (for example cholera outbreaks due to sewage contamination). Early monitoring focused on chemical indicators, then bacteria, and finally algae, fungi and protozoa. A new type of monitoring involves quantifying differing groups of organisms (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and fish) and measuring the stream conditions associated with them. 

Threats to freshwater biodiversity include overexploitation, water pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat, and invasion by exotic species. Climate change is putting further pressure on these ecosystems because water temperatures have already increased by about 1 °C, and there have been significant declines in ice coverage which have caused subsequent ecosystem stresses.

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems: Lentic (slow moving water, including pools, ponds, and lakes), lotic (faster moving water, for example streams and rivers) and wetlands (areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time). Limnology (and its branch freshwater biology) is a study about freshwater ecosystems.

== Threats ==
=== Biodiversity ===
Five broad threats to freshwater biodiversity include overexploitation, water pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat, and invasion by exotic species. Recent extinction trends can be attributed largely to sedimentation, stream fragmentation, chemical and organic pollutants, dams, and invasive species. Common chemical stresses on freshwater ecosystem health include acidification, eutrophication and copper and pesticide contamination.

Freshwater biodiversity faces many threats. The World Wide Fund for Nature&#x27;s Living Planet Index noted an 83% decline in the populations of freshwater vertebrates between 1970 and 2014. These declines continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The causes of these declines are related to: 

# A rapidly changing climate
# Online wildlife trade and invasive species
# Infectious disease
# Toxic algae blooms
# Hydropower damming and fragmenting of half the world&#x27;s rivers
# Emerging contaminants, such as hormones
# Engineered nanomaterials
# Microplastic pollution
# Light and noise interference
# Saltier coastal freshwaters due to sea level rise
# Calcium concentrations falling below the needs of some freshwater organisms
# The additive—and possibly synergistic—effects of these threats

=== Invasive species ===
Invasive plants and animals are a major issue to freshwater ecosystems, in many cases outcompeting native species and altering water conditions. Introduced species are especially devastating to ecosystems that are home to endangered species. An example of this being the Asian carp competing with the paddlefish in the Mississippi river. Common causes of invasive species in freshwater ecosystems include aquarium releases, introduction for sport fishing, and introduction for use as a food fish.

=== Extinction of freshwater fauna ===
Over 123 freshwater fauna species have gone extinct in North America since 1900. Of North American freshwater species, an estimated 48.5% of mussels, 22.8% of gastropods, 32.7% of crayfishes, 25.9% of amphibians, and 21.2% of fish are either endangered or threatened. Extinction rates of many species may increase severely into the next century because of invasive species, loss of keystone species, and species which are already functionally extinct (e.g., species which are not reproducing). Even using conservative estimates, freshwater fish extinction rates in North America are 877 times higher than background extinction rates (1 in 3,000,000 years). Projected extinction rates for freshwater animals are around five times greater than for land animals, and are comparable to the rates for rainforest communities. Given the dire state of freshwater biodiversity, a team of scientists and practitioners from around the globe recently drafted an Emergency Action plan to try and restore freshwater biodiversity.

Current freshwater biomonitoring techniques focus primarily on community structure, but some programs measure functional indicators like biochemical (or biological) oxygen demand, sediment oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen. Macroinvertebrate community structure is commonly monitored because of the diverse taxonomy, ease of collection, sensitivity to a range of stressors, and overall value to the ecosystem. Additionally, algal community structure (often using diatoms) is measured in biomonitoring programs. Algae are also taxonomically diverse, easily collected, sensitive to a range of stressors, and overall valuable to the ecosystem. Algae grow very quickly and communities may represent fast changes in environmental conditions.

In addition to community structure, responses to freshwater stressors are investigated by experimental studies that measure organism behavioural changes, altered rates of growth, reproduction or mortality. Experimental results on single species under controlled conditions may not always reflect natural conditions and multi-species communities.

The use of reference sites is common when defining the idealized &quot;health&quot; of a freshwater ecosystem. Reference sites can be selected spatially by choosing sites with minimal impacts from human disturbance and influence. However, reference conditions may also be established temporally by using preserved indicators such as diatom valves, macrophyte pollen, insect chitin and fish scales can be used to determine conditions prior to large scale human disturbance. These temporal reference conditions are often easier to reconstruct in standing water than moving water because stable sediments can better preserve biological indicator materials.

=== Climate change ===

The effects of climate change greatly complicate and frequently exacerbate the impacts of other stressors that threaten many fish, invertebrates, phytoplankton, and other organisms. Climate change is increasing the average temperature of water bodies, and worsening other issues such as changes in substrate composition, oxygen concentration, and other system changes that have ripple effects on the biology of the system. Water temperatures have already increased by around 1 °C, and significant declines in ice coverage have caused subsequent ecosystem stresses.

<text>In economics, diminishing returns means the decrease in marginal (incremental) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, holding all other factors of production equal (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;). The law of diminishing returns (also known as the law of diminishing marginal productivity) states that in a productive process, if a factor of production continues to increase, while holding all other production factors constant, at some point a further incremental unit of input will return a lower amount of output. The law of diminishing returns does not imply a decrease in overall production capabilities; rather, it defines a point on a production curve at which producing an additional unit of output will result in a lower profit. Under diminishing returns, output remains positive, but productivity and efficiency decrease.

The modern understanding of the law adds the dimension of holding other outputs equal, since a given process is understood to be able to produce co-products. An example would be a factory increasing its saleable product, but also increasing its CO2 production, for the same input increase. The law of diminishing returns is a fundamental principle of both micro and macro economics and it plays a central role in production theory.

The concept of diminishing returns can be explained by considering other theories such as the concept of exponential growth. It is commonly understood that growth will not continue to rise exponentially, rather it is subject to different forms of constraints such as limited availability of resources and capitalisation which can cause economic stagnation. This example of production holds true to this common understanding as production is subject to the four factors of production which are land, labour, capital and enterprise. These factors have the ability to influence economic growth and can eventually limit or inhibit continuous exponential growth. Therefore, as a result of these constraints the production process will eventually reach a point of maximum yield on the production curve and this is where marginal output will stagnate and move towards zero. Innovation in the form of technological advances or managerial progress can minimise or eliminate diminishing returns to restore productivity and efficiency and to generate profit.

This idea can be understood outside of economics theory, for example, population. The population size on Earth is growing rapidly, but this will not continue forever (exponentially). Constraints such as resources will see the population growth stagnate at some point and begin to decline. Similarly, it will begin to decline towards zero but not actually become a negative value, the same idea as in the diminishing rate of return inevitable to the production process.

==History==
The concept of diminishing returns can be traced back to the concerns of early economists such as Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Jacques Turgot, Adam Smith, James Steuart, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo. The law of diminishing returns can be traced back to the 18th century, in the work of Jacques Turgot. He argued that &quot;each increase [in an input] would be less and less productive.&quot; In 1815, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, Edward West, and Robert Torrens applied the concept of diminishing returns to land rent. These works were relevant to the committees of Parliament in England, who were investigating why grain prices were so high, and how to reduce them. The four economists concluded that the prices of the products had risen due to the Napoleonic Wars, which affected international trade and caused farmers to move to lands which were undeveloped and further away. In addition, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, grain imports were restored which caused a decline in prices because the farmers needed to attract customers and sell their products faster. 

Classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs whereas Neoclassical economists assume that each &quot;unit&quot; of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire production process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns remains an important consideration in areas of production such as farming and agriculture.

Proposed on the cusp of the First Industrial Revolution, it was motivated with single outputs in mind. In recent years, economists since the 1970s have sought to redefine the theory to make it more appropriate and relevant in modern economic societies. Specifically, it looks at what assumptions can be made regarding number of inputs, quality, substitution and complementary products, and output co-production, quantity and quality.

The origin of the law of diminishing returns was developed primarily within the agricultural industry. In the early 19th century, David Ricardo as well as other English economists previously mentioned, adopted this law as the result of the lived experience in England after the war. It was developed by observing the relationship between prices of wheat and corn and the quality of the land which yielded the harvests. The observation was that at a certain point, that the quality of the land kept increasing, but so did the cost of produce etc. Therefore, each additional unit of labour on agricultural fields, actually provided a diminishing or marginally decreasing return.

==Example==
A common example of diminishing returns is choosing to hire more people on a factory floor to alter current manufacturing and production capabilities. Given that the capital on the floor (e.g. manufacturing machines, pre-existing technology, warehouses) is held constant, increasing from one employee to two employees is, theoretically, going to more than double production possibilities and this is called increasing returns.

If 50 people are employed, at some point, increasing the number of employees by two percent (from 50 to 51 employees) would increase output by two percent and this is called constant returns.

Further along the production curve at, for example 100 employees, floor space is likely getting crowded, there are too many people operating the machines and in the building, and workers are getting in each other&#x27;s way. Increasing the number of employees by two percent (from 100 to 102 employees) would increase output by less than two percent and this is called &quot;diminishing returns&quot;.

At some (maybe much later) point (perhaps with 200 employees), each additional employee will actually decrease production. This is called &quot;negative returns&quot;.

Through each of these examples, the floor space and capital of the factor remained constant, i.e., these inputs were held constant. By only increasing the number of people, eventually the productivity and efficiency of the process moved from increasing returns to diminishing returns.

To understand this concept thoroughly, acknowledge the importance of marginal output or marginal returns. Returns eventually diminish because economists measure productivity with regard to additional units (marginal). Additional inputs significantly impact efficiency or returns more in the initial stages. The point in the process before returns begin to diminish is considered the optimal level. Being able to recognize this point is beneficial, as other variables in the production function can be altered rather than continually increasing labor.

Further, examine something such as the Human Development Index, which would presumably continue to rise so long as GDP per capita (in purchasing power parity terms) was increasing. This would be a rational assumption because GDP per capita is a function of HDI. Even GDP per capita will reach a point where it has a diminishing rate of return on HDI. Just think, in a low income family, an average increase of income will likely make a huge impact on the wellbeing of the family. Parents could provide abundantly more food and healthcare essentials for their family. That is a significantly increasing rate of return. But, if you gave the same increase to a wealthy family, the impact it would have on their life would be minor. Therefore, the rate of return provided by that average increase in income is diminishing.

== Mathematics ==
Signify formula_1

Increasing Returns: formula_2

Constant Returns: formula_3

Diminishing Returns: formula_4

=== Production function ===
There is a widely recognised production function in economics: &quot;Q= f(NR, L, K, t, E)&quot;:

* The point of diminishing returns can be realised, by use of the second derivative in the above production function. 
*Which can be simplified to: &quot;Q= f(L,K)&quot;.
* This signifies that output (Q) is dependent on a function of all variable (L) and fixed (K) inputs in the production process. This is the basis to understand. What is important to understand after this is the math behind marginal product. &quot;MP= ΔTP/ ΔL.&quot; 
* This formula is important to relate back to diminishing rates of return. It finds the change in total product divided by change in labour.
* The marginal product formula suggests that MP should increase in the short run with increased labour. In the long run, this increase in workers will either have no effect or a negative effect on the output. This is due to the effect of fixed costs as a function of output, in the long run.

=== Link with output elasticity ===
Start from the equation for the marginal product: formula_5

To demonstrate diminishing returns, two conditions are satisfied; marginal product is positive, and marginal product is decreasing.

Elasticity, a function of input and output, formula_6, can be taken for small input changes. If the above two conditions are satisfied, then formula_7.

This works intuitively;

# If formula_8 is positive, since negative inputs and outputs are impossible,
# And formula_9 is positive, since a positive return for inputs is required for diminishing &quot;returns&quot;

* Then formula_10

# formula_11 is relative change in output, formula_12 is relative change in input
# The relative change in output is smaller than the relative change in input; ~input requires increasing effort to change output~

* Then formula_13

==Returns and costs==
There is an inverse relationship between returns of inputs and the cost of production, although other features such as input market conditions can also affect production costs. Suppose that a kilogram of seed costs one dollar, and this price does not change. Assume for simplicity that there are no fixed costs. One kilogram of seeds yields one ton of crop, so the first ton of the crop costs one dollar to produce. That is, for the first ton of output, the marginal cost as well as the average cost of the output is per ton. If there are no other changes, then if the second kilogram of seeds applied to land produces only half the output of the first (showing diminishing returns), the marginal cost would equal per half ton of output, or per ton, and the average cost is per 3/2 tons of output, or /3 per ton of output. Similarly, if the third kilogram of seeds yields only a quarter ton, then the marginal cost equals per quarter ton or per ton, and the average cost is per 7/4 tons, or /7 per ton of output. Thus, diminishing marginal returns imply increasing marginal costs and increasing average costs.

Cost is measured in terms of opportunity cost. In this case the law also applies to societies – the opportunity cost of producing a single unit of a good generally increases as a society attempts to produce more of that good. This explains the bowed-out shape of the production possibilities frontier.

== Justification ==

=== &quot;Ceteris paribus&quot; ===
Part of the reason one input is altered &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, is the idea of disposability of inputs. With this assumption, essentially that some inputs are above the efficient level. Meaning, they can decrease without perceivable impact on output, after the manner of excessive fertiliser on a field.

If input disposability is assumed, then increasing the principal input, while decreasing those excess inputs, could result in the same &quot;diminished return&quot;, as if the principal input was changed &quot;certeris paribus&quot;. While considered &quot;hard&quot; inputs, like labour and assets, diminishing returns would hold true. In the modern accounting era where inputs can be traced back to movements of financial capital, the same case may reflect constant, or increasing returns.

It is necessary to be clear of the &quot;fine structure&quot; of the inputs before proceeding. In this, &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; is disambiguating.

<doc id="762053" wikidata="Q3825285" url="?curid=762053" title="Vulcan nerve pinch">
<text>In the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the Vulcan nerve pinch is a fictional technique used mainly by Vulcans to render unconsciousness by pinching a pressure point at the base of the victim&#x27;s neck.

==Origin==

The script for &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; (1966) stated that Spock &quot;kayoes&quot; (Knocks Out) Captain Kirk (William Shatner)&#x27;s duplicate, but Leonard Nimoy, who opposed the Vietnam War and supported Eugene McCarthy, felt that such a brutal action would be unnecessarily violent for a Vulcan. He therefore invented an alternative by suggesting that Vulcans may know enough about human anatomy, or they may have the ability to project telepathic energy from their fingertips, that they could render a human unconscious.

Allegedly, Leo Penn, the director of the episode, did not understand the idea when Nimoy explained it to him, but William Shatner understood immediately and reacted in exactly the way Nimoy had hoped when they executed the move during filming, explaining that it would be similar to &quot;feeling an electrical charge.&quot; From then on, the pinch was referred to as the &quot;FSNP&quot;, for &quot;Famous Spock Nerve Pinch&quot;, in &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s scripts.

==Physiology==
Although entirely fictional, fans and critics of the show have tried to explain how the pinch may work. It has been compared to the &quot;karate chop&quot;, which was used implausibly in other 1960s television series to render opponents unconscious.

Nimoy&#x27;s theory that the pinch may be linked to telepathy is in contrast to when two non-telepathic entities, the android Data and &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s holographic Doctor use the pinch in later &quot;Star Trek&quot; television shows.

The book &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot; by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry offers a simple explanation: the pinch blocks blood and nerve responses from reaching the brain, leading to unconsciousness. How this might lead to instantaneous unconsciousness is not explained. In this earliest of &quot;Star Trek&quot; reference books, the pinch is referred to as the &quot;Spock Pinch.&quot;

At least one being, Gary Seven&quot;, the Doctor inspects a crewmember who was found unconscious and observes an extreme trauma to the trapezius neck bundle, &quot;as though her nerve fibers have been ruptured&quot;; and it is later revealed that the person was the victim of a nerve pinch.

==Use within the franchise==
Along with Spock, various other characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise have used the technique. Notably, the above-mentioned instances with Data and the holographic Doctor, &quot;&quot;DS9&quot;&quot;″s Changeling, Odo, &quot;&quot;TNG&quot;&quot;″s Jean-Luc Picard, &quot;&quot;VOY&quot;&quot;″s Seven of Nine. &quot;&quot;ENT&quot;&quot;″s T&#x27;Pol, &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s Michael Burnham.

However, it is not an easy technique to master. After Spock uses the pinch in the episode &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, Kirk says to Spock, &quot;Pity you can&#x27;t teach me that&quot;, and Spock replies, &quot;I have tried, Captain.&quot; In the film &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), Dr. McCoy was unable to use the nerve pinch despite being in possession of Spock&#x27;s &quot;katra&quot; (his &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;).

The nerve pinch has been shown being used on animals. In the &quot;Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Yesteryear&quot;, Spock uses the nerve pinch on a &quot;Le-matya&quot; (a mountain lion-like creature) to save the life of his younger self. In the 1989 film &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, Spock uses the pinch to subdue a horse during a battle.

==In popular culture==

The Vulcan nerve pinch has been referred to, and parodied, in a wide variety of television, film, and other media.

===In television===
* In the Stephen King mini-series &quot;The Langoliers&quot; (1995), a character says, &quot;You ever watch Mr. Spock on &quot;Star Trek&quot;?&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Cause if you don&#x27;t shut your cakehole, you bloody idiot, I&#x27;ll be happy to demonstrate his Vulcan sleeper-hold for you.&quot;
* On the Netflix series &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; Season One, Episode Nine &quot;The French Connection Caper&quot;, Shadow-San uses the Vulcan nerve pinch on Coach Brunt to render her unconscious and help Carmen escape before the police arrive.
* In the episode of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, &quot;Raging Bully&quot;, Ferb uses the Vulcan nerve pinch on Buford for getting offended. Phineas is surprised but he replies, &quot;Well, he was all up in my face.&quot;
* In the episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;The Heartbreak&quot; (1x19), Summer Roberts makes a reference to this when Seth Cohen tries to massage her before sex, which she finds uncomfortable and asks, &quot;What&#x27;s up with the Vulcan nerve pinch?&quot;
* In the episode of &quot;iCarly&quot;, Season 3, Episode 17 &quot;iPsycho&quot;, Sam Puckett uses the Vulcan nerve pinch to render Nora, their kidnapper, unconscious in order to finally escape. When asked by Spencer Shay why she is sleeping on the floor in a digital photo, Carly replies that she is unconscious. Spencer replies &quot;You did the Vulcan squeezer thing?&quot; which received affirmation from Sam.
* In the Audi commercial &quot;Leonard Nimoy vs. Zachary Quinto - The Challenge&quot;, Nimoy uses an apparent real-life version on Quinto to win a bet. (Both actors played Spock in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Nimoy on television and early movies, and Quinto in the 2010s films.)

===In film===
* In Mel Brooks&#x27; film &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, Lone Starr tries to use it on a henchman, initially unsuccessfully, but the henchman points out Lone Starr&#x27;s mistakes—he gripped where the head meets the neck, when he should have gripped where the neck meets the shoulders—and is used again, successfully this time.

<doc id="762062" wikidata="Q5004276" url="?curid=762062" title="Byron, London, Ontario">
<text>Byron is a neighbourhood in the City of London, Ontario, Canada. It is adjacent to the Thames River in the south-west of London. Almost all of its residents live in low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2011, the area is home to 15,525 residents.

The neighbourhood is considered a high-income area, with an average family income of $130,587 an average dwelling value of $312,896 and a home ownership rate of 93%.

==History==
Byron was originally called Westminster, then renamed Hall&#x27;s Mill, and then finally Byron; named for the poet Lord Byron. The Byron area was settled in 1800 and first became a village in 1804. Up until 1857 the community was known as Hall&#x27;s Mills, for Charles Hall, post master. On March 7, 1961, it was annexed by the city of London and the population grew substantially with the development of large subdivisions around the original village.

==Government and politics==
Byron exists within the federal electoral district of London West. It is currently represented by Arielle Kayabaga of the Liberal Party of Canada, first elected in 2021.

Provincially, the area is within the constituency of London West. It is currently represented by Peggy Sattler of the New Democratic Party, first elected in 2013 and re-elected in 2014, 2018, and 2022.

In London&#x27;s non-partisan municipal politics, Byron lies within ward 9. It is currently represented by Councillor Anna Hopkins, first elected in 2014.

==Education==
===Elementary schools===

There are six publicly funded elementary schools in Byron:
* Byron Northview Public School
* Byron Somerset Public School
:Opened in the early 1990s, this school has 337 students in JK to Grade 8. It was built in a former gravel pit, excavated by AAROC Aggregates. Its architecture was by the firm Lamb, Jorden and Jensen, which later became Carsten Jensen.
* Byron Southwood Public School
* St. George Catholic School
* St. Theresa Catholic School
* St. Nicholas Catholic School

The first three schools are under the jurisdiction of the Thames Valley District School Board and the latter three are part of the London District Catholic School Board.

===Secondary schools===
There are no secondary schools located in Byron (a source of some consternation to residents, as a secondary school was originally promised by the city of London when Byron was annexed). Two publicly funded secondary schools serve the needs of Byron students. The nearest is St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School in the London District Catholic School Board, to the north across the Thames River. This school primarily serves the needs of Roman Catholic students, though, as it is publicly funded, students of any religious denomination may attend. Most secondary school age students in Byron choose to attend Saunders Secondary School in the Thames Valley District School Board in the Westmount suburb of London. Though they do not live within the drawing area, a number of secondary school age children from Byron currently attend Oakridge Secondary School, located in the neighbourhood of Oakridge in London.

===Private schools===
There is one private (for profit) school in Byron. This is a Montessori pre-school, located on Commissioners Road between Grand View Ave and Chestnut Hill.

==Attractions==
Byron is home to Springbank Park, a picturesque urban park and the largest in London. Within Springbank Park is Storybook Gardens, a popular children&#x27;s attraction open year-round. Byron also has Boler Mountain, a small co-operative that offers skiing, snowboarding, snow-tubing, and mountain bike terrains.

Byron hosted two cycling events during the 2001 Canada Summer Games: the mountain biking event on Boler Mountain, and the road cycling event, where cyclists raced through the heart of the village.

==Infrastructure==
===Byron Telephone Company===
Byron was served until August 1960 by the Byron Telephone Company, when it was sold to Bell Canada. A manual telephone exchange continued to operate until September 15, 1963, and in 1962 or 1963, the short code 471 was introduced to London exchange customers for the convenience of immediately reaching the Byron operator to complete a call. Upon dial introduction, 471 became the exchange prefix.

However, some two or three years before 1960, the Byron Telephone Company converted its Lambeth-area customers to a dial exchange, the OLiver 2 exchange.

==Location==
The current boundaries of Byron are generally regarded to be the land south of the Thames River and west of Colonel Talbot Road. Recent housing developments have expanded Byron southward to Southdale Road and westward to Wickerson Road. Outside of the urban area, Byron is surrounded by farmland and forested areas. On the eastern border of Byron is the Byron Gravel Pit, the sixteenth-largest gravel pit in Canada. Historically, Byron also consisted of some land north of the Thames River in the area known today as Oakridge Park, including the Byron Bog (now Sifton Bog).

==Controversy==
In 2000, Tim Hortons, which had 44 locations throughout London, sought to open its first full-service location in Byron. At the time, Tim Horton&#x27;s presence in Byron was limited to a kiosk inside the A&amp;P grocery store with no seating, limited hours, and a limited menu.

Tim Hortons was met by bitter opposition from a small group of members of the community, which had also stopped an entry by Tim Hortons into Byron in 1998. Some members of the group claimed building a Tim Hortons would ruin the &quot;small-town atmosphere,&quot; generating too much traffic and noise.

London City Council sided with local residents and refused to rezone a parcel of land along Commissioners Road to permit Tim Hortons to build a store there. TDL Group Ltd. appealed the decision to the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB), which sided with TDL and ordered the city to permit the required rezoning. Tim Hortons opened its Byron location in December 2001.

==Notable Byronites==
*Megan Park, Actor
*Ron Calhoun, executive director of Partners in Research
*Jack McIntyre, hockey player
*Rob Ramage, hockey player and vehicular manslaughter convict
*Mike Van Ryn, hockey player
*Tim Tindale, American football player
*Andy Spruce, hockey player

<text>Systems neuroscience is a subdiscipline of neuroscience and systems biology that studies the structure and function of various neural circuits and systems that make up the central nervous system of an organism. Systems neuroscience encompasses a number of areas of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural pathways, neural circuits, and larger brain networks. At this level of analysis, neuroscientists study how different neural circuits work together to analyze sensory information, form perceptions of the external world, form emotions, make decisions, and execute movements. Researchers in systems neuroscience are concerned with the relation between molecular and cellular approaches to understanding brain structure and function, as well as with the study of high-level mental functions such as language, memory, and self-awareness (which are the purview of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience). To deepen their understanding of these relations and understanding, systems neuroscientists typically employ techniques for understanding networks of neurons as they are seen to function, by way of electrophysiology using either single-unit recording or multi-electrode recording, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and PET scans. The term is commonly used in an educational framework: a common sequence of graduate school neuroscience courses consists of cellular/molecular neuroscience for the first semester, then systems neuroscience for the second semester. It is also sometimes used to distinguish a subdivision within a neuroscience department in a university.

== Major branches ==
Systems neuroscience has three major branches in relation to measuring the brain: behavioral neuroscience, computational modeling, and brain activity. Through these three branches, it breaks down the core concepts of systems neuroscience and provides valuable information about how the functional systems of an organism interact independently and intertwined with one another.

=== Behavioral neuroscience ===
Behavioral neuroscience in relation to systems neuroscience focuses on representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which categorizes brain activity patterns and compares them across different conditions, such as the dissimilar level of brain activity observing an animal in comparison to an inanimate object. These models give a quantitative representation of behavior while providing comparable models of the patterns observed.5 Correlations or anticorrelations between brain-activity patterns are used during experimental conditions to distinguish the processing of each brain region when stimuli is presented.

=== Computational modeling ===
Computational models provide a base form of brain-activity level, which is typically represented by the firing of a single neuron. This is essential for understanding systems neuroscience as it shows the physical changes that occur during functional changes in an organism. While these models are important for understanding brain-activity, one-to-one correspondence of neuron firing has not been completely uncovered yet. Different measurements of the same activity lead to different patterns, when in theory, the patterns should be the same, or at least similar to one another. However, studies show fundamental differences when it comes to measuring the brain, and science strives to investigate this dissimilarity. 

=== Brain activity ===
Brain activity and brain imaging help scientists understand the differences between functional systems of an organism in combination with computational models and the understanding of behavioral neuroscience. The three major branches of systems neuroscience work together to provide the most accurate information about brain activity as neuroimaging allows in its current state. While there can always be improvements to brain-activity measurements, typical imaging studies through electrophysiology can already provide massive amounts of information about the systems of an organism and how they may work intertwined with one another. For example, using the core branches of systems neuroscience, scientists have been able to dissect a migraine’s attack on the nervous system by observing brain-activity dissimilarities and using computational modeling to compare the differences of a functioning brain and a brain affected by a migraine.6

== Observations ==
Systems neuroscience is observed through electrophysiology, which focuses on the electrical activity of biological systems in an organism. Through electrophysiology studies, the activity levels of different systems in the body help explain abnormalities of systematic functioning, such as an abnormal heartbeat rhythm or a stroke. While the main focus of electrophysiology is the heart, it does provide informational scanning of brain activity in relation to other bodily functions, which can be useful for the connection of neurological activity between systems.

Although systems neuroscience is generally observed in relation to a human’s level of functioning, many studies have been conducted on drosophila, or the small fruit fly, as it is considered to be easier due to the simpler brain structure and more controllable genetic and environmental factors from an experimental standpoint. While there are strong dissimilarities between the functioning capabilities of a fruit fly in comparison to a human, these studies still provide valuable insight on how a human brain might work.

Neural circuits and neuron firing is more easily observable in fruit flies through functional brain imaging, as neuronal pathways are simplified and, therefore, are easier to follow. These pathways may be simple, but by understanding the basis of neuron firing, this can lead to important studies on a human’s neuronal pathway and eventually to a one-to-one neuron correspondence when a system is functioning.7

<doc id="762070" wikidata="Q476913" url="?curid=762070" title="Siskiyou Mountains">
<text>The Siskiyou Mountains are a coastal subrange of the Klamath Mountains, and located in northwestern California and southwestern Oregon in the United States. They extend in an arc for approximately from east of Crescent City, California, northeast along the north side of the Klamath River into Josephine and Jackson counties in Oregon. The mountain range forms a barrier between the watersheds of the Klamath River to the south and the Rogue River to the north. Accordingly, much of the range is within the Rogue River – Siskiyou and Klamath national forests, and the Pacific Crest Trail follows a portion of the crest of the Siskiyous.

These mountains are not the highest of the Klamath Mountains, but because of the relief so close to the Pacific Ocean, the peaks receive significant precipitation from the ocean, including wintertime snow on the peaks. Western canyons can receive over of rain in some winters and are densely forested, while eastern areas are more arid. The greatly varied topography and climate contribute to high biodiversity, and the Siskiyous are noted for a number of endemic species.

== Name origins ==
The origin of the word &quot;siskiyou&quot; is unclear. One version is that it is the Chinook Jargon word for &quot;bob-tailed horse&quot;. According to historian Richard Mackie, &quot;siskiyou&quot; was a Cree word for a bob-tailed horse, one of which perished in 1829 during Alexander McLeod&#x27;s journey over a pass later named for the &quot;siskiyou&quot; (today&#x27;s Siskiyou Pass). The Cree were in the area as part of McLeod&#x27;s Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company expedition, and had been recruited far away in their homeland in eastern Canada. Another version, given in an argument before the State Senate in 1852, is that the French name &quot;Six Cailloux&quot;, meaning &quot;six-stones&quot;, was given to a ford on the Umpqua River by Michel Laframboise and a party of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trappers in 1832, because six large stones or rocks lay in the river where they crossed. According to some, the &quot;Six Cailloux&quot; name was appropriated to this region by Stephen Meek, another Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trapper who was known for his &quot;discovery&quot; of Scott Valley, in regard to a crossing on the Klamath River near Hornbrook. Still others attribute the name to the multiple nations of Native Americans. that share geography with California and Oregon speaking the Athapaskan Language

==History==
Indigenous People from multiple Nations that share geography with California and Oregon speaking the Athapaskan Language lived along the Rogue River prior to 1850. These communities were primarily winter residences, and the Indigenous People likely spent much of the summer in the mountains.

===Early Colonization===
Most early colonization of the area came from the coast, beginning in 1775, when the Spanish lieutenant Bruno de Heceta came to the Northwest. He would be followed in 1791 and 1792 by other colonizers like captain George Vancouver, James Baker, and Robert Gray. The early western overland colonizations all avoided the area around the Oregon–California border. The first land-based colonization came when the North West Company came to the area in 1820, followed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1821.

The Siskiyou Trail stretched from California&#x27;s Central Valley through the Siskiyous to Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley. Originally based on existing foot trails made by Native American that share geography with California and Oregon speaking the Athapaskan Language, winding their way through river valleys, the Siskiyou Trail provided the shortest practical travel path between early settlements in California and Oregon in the 1820s.

===New Colonization and early industry===
As colonization increased with a variety of new incentives, tensions over relations with Indigenous People from multiple Nations that share geography with California and Oregon already living in the area increased. In the 1850s, following the Donation Land Claim Act, miners came to the area to prospect for gold. Thousands of miners flooded into the area as profitable claims were made. The new settlements grew enough for Jackson County to be founded, with its seat in Jacksonville, in 1853. The large and sudden influx of white population deteriorated the relationship with the natives in the area. This led to the 1855 Rogue River Wars, which ended in 1856.

The new population of colonists needed to be supported by an improved infrastructure. By 1859, the trail had been replaced by a toll road. A telegraph line was built over the summit in 1864. By the end of the 1870s, the first private lumber mills were established in the mountains had been established in some of the lower creeks. Commercial orchards began to be planted in 1885. The Southern Pacific Railroad was completed over Siskiyou Summit in 1887. The new railroads were focused around Medford.

===Industry develops===
The Klamath Lake Railroad Company built a railroad into Pokegama from 1900 to 1903. It became a vital part of the lumber industry and was acquired by Weyerhaeuser in 1905. Irrigation projects that began at the end of the 19th century led to a boom in the fruit orchard industry. Apple blights around 1900 diminished the crop and pears began to be a major crop. By 1910, pears had begun to replace apples as the major fruit grown in the region. In 1927, the Jackson County seat moved to Medford, which had become much larger than Jacksonville.

==Geography==

The highest peaks in the range include Mount Ashland at an elevation of , Dutchman Peak at , Siskiyou Peak at , and Wagner Butte at , all of which are in Oregon. The highest peak in the California portion of the range is Preston Peak at . There are also several lower mountains, including Ben Johnson Mountain, which reaches . The main drainage basins in the mountains are those of the Rogue and Klamath rivers.

===Siskiyou Summit===

Interstate 5 passes through the Siskiyou Mountains at Siskiyou Summit, located just north of the Oregon-California border, and just south of Ashland, Oregon. Siskiyou Summit is the highest pass on Interstate 5, at . This pass is one of the most treacherous in the Interstate highway system. The California side has a more gradual slope than the Oregon side, where the freeway climbs or descends in elevation over about . In addition, the pass includes several hazardous curves, and is frequently hit with snow, ice, and fog during winter storms. In winter, it is common for the highway to be closed one to four times per year by transportation authorities because of hazardous conditions. The speed limit is , but lower limits are set for larger vehicles.

==Climate==
The climate of the mountains is distinctive in how it varies from the coast to the inland slopes. Generally, the mountains see milder temperatures and more precipitation nearer to the coast. The interior is drier and warmer in the summer months, and the eastern slopes resemble an interior climate.

The coast tends to receive about of precipitation each year, rising to at the peaks. The arid eastern areas receive around annually. Precipitation is greatest in the winter and least in the summer. Fogs provide an additional source of water at low elevations near the coast, especially in summer. Most precipitation at lower elevations comes as rain. At higher elevations, snow is a major source of water.

Temperature tends to change most in the east–west direction because of the ocean&#x27;s major influence. The mean annual temperature is around at low elevations. Higher in the mountains and farther east, the temperatures range from overnight lows just above freezing to highs around .

==Ecology==
There is considerable biodiversity within the Siskiyou Mountains, including extensive forests. Forests vary by elevation and relative locations, being primarily divided into mixed evergreen forests, montane forests, and subalpine forests.

===Flora===

The occurrences of tree species are divided by these forest types. Exceptions to this exist. Coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot; subsp. &quot;menziesii&quot;) occurs in both mixed evergreen and montane forests. Lawson&#x27;s cypress (also known as Port Orford cedar, &quot;Chamaecypraris lawsoniana&quot;) occurs throughout the range west of the summit. California white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot; subsp. &quot;lowiana&quot;) occurs in montane and subalpine forests above . In the montane forest, occurring in the snowzone, sugar pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot;) also occurs. The subalpine forests above include mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;) and Shasta red fir (&quot;A. magnifica&quot; subsp. &quot;shastensis&quot;) in addition to Douglas-fir. Ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) is dominant only in montane forests on steep south-facing slopes, but also grows with California black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;) and in mixed evergreen forests. Rare Pacific yew (&quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;) grow at low elevations or at higher elevations near sources of water. Other conifers include weeping spruce (&quot;Picea breweriana&quot;), an endemic species, and coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;).

Various deciduous broadleaf trees grow in addition to the conifers. The largest extant California black oak is found in the Siskiyou Mountains. The blue oak, &quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;, is beyond its contiguous range; however, there are disjunctive populations of blue oak within the Siskiyou Mountains.

Invasive species have become a concern in some areas. Some of these include yellow starthistle and scotch broom. Starthistle has become a problem in the Siskiyous only in the last 20 years. It has little value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants. Purple loosestrife is a plant that is invasive to waterways.

===Animals===
The diversity of fauna in the region is exhibited by the number of amphibian, reptile, and avian species in the region. Many of the amphibian and reptiles are endemic species. The eponymous endangered Siskiyou Mountains salamander is found within this mountain range; there is also the Scott Bar salamander. The variety of habitats in the mountains contributes to the number of bird species in the area, because the birds have more variety of habitat available to them. However, many birds disperse from the area following the breeding season. These birds include the endangered spotted owl, which lives in forests up to . Endangered salmon live in the Rogue and Klamath watersheds.

Mammals in the area include small rodents, deer and elk, and bear and coyote. Medium-sized mammals also live in the region, including red fox, gray fox, and weasel. Another rare animal is the fisher, a predatory medium-sized mammal that lives in old-growth forest.

==Protected areas==
The Siskiyou Mountains have federal protection in several forms. Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve protects in the northern part of the range south of Grants Pass, Oregon. The Cascade–Siskiyou National Monument protects at the junction of the Siskiyou and Cascade ranges. There are three designated wilderness areas in the range in Oregon and California—the Red Buttes Wilderness, which protects ; the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, which protects ; and the Siskiyou Wilderness, which protects .

<doc id="762072" wikidata="Q8032214" url="?curid=762072" title="Wood Gundy">
<text>Wood Gundy Inc. was a leading Canadian stock brokerage and investment banking firm. Founded in 1905, it was acquired by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in 1988 as it attempted to build an investment banking business. The Wood Gundy name was used extensively by the bank&#x27;s investment banking arm, which was known as CIBC Wood Gundy until 1997. Today, CIBC&#x27;s investment banking business is known as CIBC World Markets, and the name CIBC Wood Gundy is used as the brand for the bank&#x27;s retail brokerage business.

==History==

===Founding and early history===
Wood, Gundy &amp; Company was established in Toronto, Ontario, in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. The firm first specialized in the distribution and underwriting of government and municipal bonds. In 1919, the firm opened an office in New York City. Founded as a partnership, the firm incorporated in 1925.

Following World War II, Wood Gundy expanded its operations, starting to underwrite and distribute securities of Canadian corporations. Continued growth was driven through Canada&#x27;s increasing industrialization and growing population, leading to greater demand for capital and investment securities. This expansion transformed Wood Gundy into a full-service investment house. Wood Gundy was the first Canadian dealer to open an office in Tokyo, and the first firm to employ a female trader on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The operations of the company, then called &quot;Wood, Gundy &amp; Company Limited&quot;, were split into two newly incorporated companies in 1962. The first, responsible for investment dealer operations, was called &quot;Wood Gundy Securities Limited&quot;. The second, responsible for the investment holding business, was named &quot;Wood Gundy Holdings Limited&quot;. These two firms existed until the early 1970s, when they reunited as a single firm under the name &quot;Wood Gundy Limited&quot;. At this time, Charles Gundy, the son of the founder, was Chairman. Wood Gundy remained the largest brokerage and securities firm in Canada until the early 1980s, when the merger of Dominion Securities and A.E. Ames created the largest firm in the country.

===Acquisition by CIBC===

By the mid-1980s, Wood Gundy, which was owned by approximately 600 of its employees, was looking for a merger partner. In 1986, Wood Gundy had nearly merged with Gordon Capital Corporation, but that deal was aborted at the last minute. By 1987, there were a number of banks actively pursuing a deal with Wood Gundy, including First National Bank of Chicago, the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Royal Bank of Canada, however these deals fell apart in the middle of the year due to high price expectations. The firm was impacted by the 1987 stock market crash in October 1987 and intensified its efforts to find a buyer.

CIBC purchased a 60 percent stake in Wood Gundy in June 1988 for C$110 million (US$86 million), representing a total value of the firm of C$183 (US$143 million). At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients.

Two years later, in 1990, CIBC continued to expand in the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company&#x27;s Canadian securities business. The acquisition included 20 offices and between 700 and 800 employees as well as access for CIBC to Merrill&#x27;s equity research. The transaction made Wood Gundy once again the largest brokerage firm in Canada. In 2001, CIBC would buy the remainder of Merrill&#x27;s Canadian business.

In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer &amp; Co. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.

<text>The Amazing Kreskin (born George Joseph Kresge Jr., January 12, 1935 – December 10, 2024), also known as Kreskin, was an American mentalist who became popular on television in the 1970s. He was inspired to become a mentalist by Lee Falk&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;, which features a crime-fighting stage magician. He always presented himself as a mentalist, never as a psychic, who operated on the basis of suggestion, not the paranormal or supernatural.

George Joseph Kresge Jr. was born on January 12, 1935, in Montclair, New Jersey, to a Polish father and Sicilian mother and grew up with his younger brother in West Caldwell, New Jersey, where he would reside for most of his life. His father worked for a battery manufacturer. Kreskin attended Seton Hall University, earning a degree in psychology. He worked for several years as a clinical psychologist while developing his act.

==Career==
From 1972 to 1975, Kreskin&#x27;s television series &quot;The Amazing World of Kreskin&quot; was broadcast throughout Canada on CTV and distributed in syndication in the United States. It was produced in Ottawa, Ontario, at the CJOH-TV studios. An additional set of episodes was produced from 1975 to 1978 at the studios of CFTO-TV in Toronto, billed as &quot;The New Kreskin Show&quot;.

His first television appearance was on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in 1964. He went on to appear approximately 100 times on each of &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and 88 times on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. It was Carson who gave him the moniker &quot;The Amazing Kreskin&quot;. Kreskin claimed that his first appearance on the &quot;Steve Allen Show&quot;, during which he tripped when blinded by stage lights, inspired Carson to create the character Carnac the Magnificent who would habitually stumble on his way to the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; desk.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Kreskin came to prominence again through several appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; as well as around 100 appearances on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; (now &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;). 

In 2009, he became the first guest to make four appearances on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

Though Kreskin made &quot;predictions&quot;, he did not claim to have paranormal or clairvoyant powers, and did not like to be considered a &quot;psychic&quot;. One of his best known tricks was to find his own paycheck for his current performance. If he did not find it, he did not get paid for that day. He would instruct the audience to hide an envelope containing the check, while he was escorted off stage and into seclusion by other members of the audience. He then re-emerged and hunted through the audience, almost always being able to ferret out the correct location.

According to Kreskin, he failed only ten or eleven times, including his performance at Rockwell&#x27;s in the Village of Pelham, where he needed two attempts and a &quot;rehide&quot; of the check with an additional two attempts at finding the check or note. On April 14, 2018, Kreskin failed to find the hidden check while performing to a sold-out crowd in Theatre Row, New York City on 42nd Street. After about 30 minutes of leading viewers around the small theater trying to find the check, Kreskin settled his search on an area behind the stage, out of view of most of the audience. The check was hidden within the general area. His efforts were in vain however, as perhaps eight to ten minutes later he threw up his hands and declared he had failed at the trick for the 12th time in 30 years.

Kreskin taught classes for law enforcement groups, which &quot;focus[ed] on psychological methods such as jogging lost memories through relaxation techniques or detecting lies through body language and voice inflections&quot;.

The 2008 movie &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; is based on the experiences of writer-director Sean McGinly, who worked briefly as Kreskin&#x27;s road manager.

On January 31, 2022, it was announced that Kreskin would provide the voice of The Magic Tree in a new animated series called &quot;The Adventures of Little Billy: In Search of the Magic Tree&quot;, based on a book of the same name by Barry J. Farber.

In September 2022, after Hugh Neutron became a playable character for Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, Mark DeCarlo, the voice actor of Hugh Neutron, wrote on Twitter that he wanted Jimmy Neutron and Kreskin to also be added to the game&#x27;s roster. Afterwards, Kreskin posted a video on Twitter saying that he would accept if he was brought into the game. In July 2023, when the trailer of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 was released and Jimmy Neutron was confirmed to be in the sequel, Kreskin released another video saying that he was still interested in being in this game.

Kreskin&#x27;s popularity peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s, though he continued to perform into the 2020s. He appeared regularly on WPIX in New York City, and annually on both the Fox News Channel and CNN to give his New Year&#x27;s Day predictions for the coming year. Kreskin&#x27;s last television appearance was on Fox Business on May 2, 2023, predicting the Super Bowl, and his last scheduled performance was on March 7, 2024, a &quot;pendulum seminar&quot; on Zoom.

Kreskin grew up in West Caldwell, New Jersey, and was a longtime resident of suburban North Caldwell and Caldwell, New Jersey. He had no children and never married.

==Health and death==
Kreskin performed into his 80s, until a few months prior to his death. He stopped performing after being injured in a fall in early 2024 and had a period of poor health in the weeks leading up to his death.

Kreskin died from complications of dementia at an assisted living facility in Wayne, New Jersey, on December 10, 2024, at the age of 89.

==Criticism==
In 2002, Kreskin made a prediction that there would be a mass UFO sighting over Las Vegas on June 6 between the hours of 9:45 PM and midnight that would be witnessed by thousands of people. He also said that if there were no sighting, he would donate $50,000 to a charity. Hundreds of people camped out that evening, yet no sighting occurred. On June 8, Kreskin appeared in the opening segment of the &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; radio show, hosted by Art Bell, to explain what had happened.

Bell read Kreskin&#x27;s press release over the air to the effect that &quot;the sighting prediction was a total fabrication in order to prove people&#x27;s susceptibility to suggestion post-9/11&quot;. Kreskin claimed he was concerned that a terrorist, with the skills of a mentalist such as himself, could pull a similar stunt involving something much worse. He stated that the predicted sighting was only an &quot;experiment&quot;. When asked about the $50,000 donation he previously promoted, Kreskin claimed there was indeed a sighting that night since he said glowing green orbs were supposedly spotted in the sky just before midnight and reported by witnesses after news camera crews had already left the scene.

Because of this one reported sighting, Kreskin said his prediction came true anyway and therefore he did not have to pay the money he previously announced. This statement offended Art Bell, who opined that this was merely a publicity stunt on Kreskin&#x27;s part, and officially banned Kreskin from his show.

In January 1973, &quot;TV Times&quot; of Hong Kong carried an interview with Kreskin in which he alluded to the possibility of this stunt—and to the dangers of the madness of crowds in general:

<doc id="762084" wikidata="Q751505" url="?curid=762084" title="Property Specification Language">
<text>Property Specification Language (PSL) is a temporal logic extending linear temporal logic with a range of operators for both ease of expression and enhancement of expressive power. PSL makes an extensive use of regular expressions and syntactic sugaring. It is widely used in the hardware design and verification industry, where formal verification tools (such as model checking) and/or logic simulation tools are used to prove or refute that a given PSL formula holds on a given design.

PSL was initially developed by Accellera for specifying properties or assertions about hardware designs. Since September 2004 the standardization on the language has been done in IEEE 1850 working group. In September 2005, the IEEE 1850 Standard for Property Specification Language (PSL) was announced.

== Syntax and semantics ==

PSL can express that if some scenario happens now, then another scenario should happen some time later. For instance, the property &quot;a should always eventually be ed&quot; can be expressed by the PSL formula: 
 always (request -&gt; eventually! grant) 
The property &quot;every that is immediately followed by an signal, should be followed by a complete , where a complete data transfer is a sequence starting with signal , ending with signal in which holds at the meantime&quot; can be expressed by the PSL formula: 
 (true[*]; req; ack) |=&gt; (start; busy[*]; end) 
A trace satisfying this formula is given in the figure on the right.
PSL&#x27;s temporal operators can be roughly classified into &quot;LTL-style&quot; operators and &quot;regular-expression-style&quot; operators. Many PSL operators come in two versions, a strong version, indicated by an exclamation mark suffix ( ), and a weak version. The &quot;strong version&quot; makes eventuality requirements (i.e. require that something will hold in the future), while the &quot;weak version&quot; does not. An &quot;underscore suffix&quot; ( ) is used to differentiate &quot;inclusive&quot; vs. &quot;non-inclusive&quot; requirements. The and suffixes are used to denote &quot;universal&quot; (all) vs. &quot;existential&quot; (exists) requirements. Exact time windows are denoted by and flexible by . 

=== SERE-style operators===

The most commonly used PSL operator is the &quot;suffix-implication&quot; operator (also known as the &quot;triggers&quot; operator), which is denoted by . Its left operand is a PSL regular expression and its right operand is any PSL formula (be it in LTL style or regular expression style). The semantics of is that on every time point i such that the sequence of time points up to i constitute a match to the regular expression r, the path from i+1 should satisfy the property p. This is exemplified in the figures on the right.


The regular expressions of PSL have the common operators for concatenation (), Kleene-closure (), and union (), as well as operator for fusion (), intersection () and a weaker version (), and many variations for consecutive counting and in-consecutive counting e.g. and .

The trigger operator comes in several variations, shown in the table below.

Here and are PSL-regular expressions, and is a PSL formula.

Operators for concatenation, fusion, union, intersection and their variations are shown in the table below.

Here and are PSL regular expressions.
Operators for consecutive repetitions are shown in the table below.

Here is a PSL regular expression. 
Operators for non-consecutive repetitions are shown in the table below.

Here is any PSL Boolean expression. 
=== LTL-style operators===

Below is a sample of some LTL-style operators of PSL.

Here and are any PSL formulas.
=== Sampling operator===

Sometimes it is desirable to change the definition of the &quot;next time-point&quot;, for instance in multiply-clocked designs, or when a higher level of abstraction is desired. The &quot;sampling operator&quot; (also known as the &quot;clock operator&quot;), denoted , is used for this purpose. The formula where is a PSL formula and a PSL Boolean expressions holds on a given path if on that path projected on the cycles in which holds, as exemplified in the figures to the right. 
The first property states that &quot;every that is immediately followed by an signal, should be followed by a complete , where a complete data transfer is a sequence starting with signal , ending with signal in which should hold at least 8 times: 
 (true[*]; req; ack) |=&gt; (start; data[=8]; end) 
But sometimes it is desired to consider only the cases where the above signals occur on a cycle where is high. 
This is depicted in the second figure in which although the formula 
 ((true[*]; req; ack) |=&gt; (start; data[*3]; end)) @ clk 
uses and is consecutive repetition, the matching trace has 3 non-consecutive time points where holds, but when considering only the time points where holds, the time points where hold become consecutive. 
The semantics of formulas with nested @ is a little subtle. The interested reader is referred to [2].

=== Abort operators ===

PSL has several operators to deal with truncated paths (finite paths that may correspond to a prefix of the computation). Truncated paths occur in bounded-model checking, due to resets and in many other scenarios. The abort operators, specify how eventualities should be dealt with when a path has been truncated. They rely on the truncated semantics proposed in [1].

Here is any PSL formula and is any PSL Boolean expression. 
===Expressive power===
PSL subsumes the temporal logic LTL and extends its expressive power to that of the omega-regular languages. The augmentation in expressive power, compared to that of LTL, which has the expressive power of the star-free ω-regular expressions, can be attributed to the &quot;suffix implication&quot;, also known as the &quot;triggers&quot; operator, denoted &quot;|-&gt;&quot;. The formula &quot;r |-&gt; f&quot; where &quot;r&quot; is a regular expression and &quot;f&quot; is a temporal logic formula holds on a computation &quot;w&quot; if any prefix of &quot;w&quot; matching &quot;r&quot; has a continuation satisfying &quot;f&quot;. Other non-LTL operators of PSL are the &quot;@&quot; operator, for specifying multiply-clocked designs, the &quot;abort&quot; operators, for dealing with hardware resets, and &quot;local variables&quot; for succinctness.

===Layers===
PSL is defined in 4 layers: the &quot;Boolean layer&quot;, the &quot;temporal layer&quot;, the &quot;modeling layer&quot; and the &quot;verification layer&quot;.
*The &quot;Boolean layer&quot; is used for describing a current state of the design and is phrased using one of the above-mentioned HDLs.
*The &quot;temporal layer&quot; consists of the temporal operators used to describe scenarios that span over time (possibly over an unbounded number of time units).
*The &quot;modeling layer&quot; can be used to describe auxiliary state machines in a procedural manner.
*The &quot;verification layer&quot; consists of directives to a verification tool (for instance to &quot;assert&quot; that a given property is correct or to &quot;assume&quot; that a certain set of properties is correct when verifying another set of properties).

===Language compatibility===
Property Specification Language can be used with multiple electronic system design languages (HDLs) such as:
* VHDL (IEEE 1076)
* Verilog (IEEE 1364)
* SystemVerilog (IEEE 1800)
* SystemC (IEEE 1666) by Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI).
When PSL is used in conjunction with one of the above HDLs, its Boolean layer uses the operators of the respective HDL.

<doc id="762085" wikidata="Q281624" url="?curid=762085" title="Earth Angel">
<text>&quot;Earth Angel&quot;, occasionally referred to as &quot;Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)&quot;, is a song by American doo-wop group the Penguins. Produced by Dootsie Williams, it was released as their debut single in October 1954 on Dootone Records. The Penguins had formed the year prior and recorded the song as a demo in a garage in South Central Los Angeles. The song&#x27;s origins lie in multiple different sources, among them songs by Jesse Belvin, Patti Page, and the Hollywood Flames. Its authorship was the subject of a bitter legal dispute with Williams in the years following its release.

Although the song was going to be overdubbed with additional instrumentation, the original demo version became an unexpected hit, quickly outstripping its A-side. The song grew out of Southern California and spread across the United States over the winter of 1954–55. &quot;Earth Angel&quot; became the first independent label release to appear on &quot;Billboard&quot; national pop charts, where it peaked within the top 10. It was a big hit on the magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B charts, where it remained number one for several weeks. A cover version by white vocal group the Crew-Cuts peaked higher on the pop charts, reaching number three. More cover versions followed, including recordings by Gloria Mann, Tiny Tim, and Johnny Tillotson.

The Penguins&#x27; only hit, it eventually sold in excess of ten million copies. The original recording of the song remained an enduring hit single for much of the 1950s, and it is now considered to be one of the definitive doo-wop songs. In 2005, it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important.&quot;

In 1998, the Penguins&#x27; 1954 recording of &quot;Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)&quot; on Dootone Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==

The Penguins—composed of lead vocalist Cleveland Duncan, bass Curtis Williams, tenor Dexter Tisby, and baritone Bruce Tate—formed at Fremont High School in Los Angeles, California in 1953. The group named themselves after the Kool cigarette advertising mascot. Williams and Gaynel Hodge were previously members of The Hollywood Flames, where they began writing &quot;Earth Angel&quot; with mentor Jesse Belvin, a Jefferson High graduate. Belvin had previously had a hit single in &quot;Dream Girl&quot;, a 1952 ballad credited to Jesse &amp; Marvin (saxophonist Marvin Phillips). The song echoes &quot;Earth Angel&quot; in its melodic refrain: &quot;Dream girl, dream girl...&quot; Its &quot;why-oh&quot; hook was adapted as a background chant within &quot;Earth Angel&quot;. The &quot;Will you be mine?&quot; hook was borrowed from the R&amp;B hit of the same name by the Swallows. The Hollywood Flames were hired that year by Jessie Mae Robinson to record a demo of &quot;I Went to Your Wedding&quot;, later recorded by Patti Page. Hodge later noted that the group lifted the bridge from that song for &quot;Earth Angel&quot;. The song also contains elements of the Flames&#x27; 1953 recording of &quot;I Know&quot; in its piano introduction and chord progressions, which were closely based on the Rodgers &amp; Hart standard &quot;Blue Moon&quot;. Williams reportedly wrote the song for his wife, Marlene, and Duncan rewrote the melody, as he disliked the original.

&quot;Earth Angel&quot; was recorded as a literal garage demo—it was recorded in a home garage at the Los Angeles home of Ted Brinson (a relative of Williams who had played bass for the Jimmie Lunceford and Andy Kirk bands). The home was located at 2190 West 30th Street in South Central Los Angeles. The garage was used as the primary recording space of Dootsie Williams for all of his Dootone artists, and had been used to record demos for Jessie Mae Robinson. It was recorded on a single-track Ampex tape recorder, owned by Brinson, who performs bass on the track. The drums were muffled with pillows so as to not overwhelm the vocals. A neighbor&#x27;s pet dog stopped many takes by barking. &quot;Every time the dog barked next door, I&#x27;d have to go out and shut him up, and then we&#x27;d do another take,&quot; remembered Williams. Curtis Williams, in addition to singing, performed piano on the track, with an unknown drummer. Preston Epps reportedly played bongos on “Hey Senorita” (though this is unconfirmed). The song is composed in the key of A-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Duncan&#x27;s vocal range spans from F3 to G4. The first five seconds of the intro are cut off of the recording by accident.

==Commercial performance==

Although it was an unfinished demo, &quot;Earth Angel&quot; began to see immediate success. Williams carried a rough acetate dub with him to Dolphin&#x27;s of Hollywood All Night Record Shop, a local record store, to gauge shop owner John Dolphin&#x27;s opinion. Dolphin broadcast a late-night rhythm and blues broadcast from his store, and KGFJ disc jockey Dick Hugg was sitting in. Hugg played both sides of the single, and by the next morning, requests began coming in for the song. As a result, Williams abandoned an idea to overdub additional instrumentation and began immediate manufacturing of the 7&quot; single to issue it as soon as possible. Still convinced &quot;Hey Señorita&quot; would be the hit, it was pressed to the A-side; disc jockeys soon began flipping the record in favor of &quot;Earth Angel&quot;. The demand for &quot;Earth Angel&quot; nearly bankrupted Dootone; producer Walter Williams ran out of label paper, leading the single to be pressed on multiple colored labels. It made its first appearance in &quot;Billboard&quot; as a territorial hit for Los Angeles, becoming the second best-selling R&amp;B single in Los Angeles for the second week of October 1954. It climbed to number one for the city by November 13, after which it began to grow in popularity in New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Nashville.

&quot;Earth Angel&quot; became the first independent label release to appear on &quot;Billboard&quot; national pop charts. &quot;Billboard&quot; called the record a &quot;Best Buy&quot; for the R&amp;B charts, and &quot;Cashbox&quot; in Canada gave it its &quot;Award o&#x27; the Week&quot;. It hit number one in New York on November 27, and by Christmas Day the song was placing on the &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot; chart for both R&amp;B and pop, where it debuted at number 25. By January 15, 1955, the single had advanced to the top 20 of the overall Best Sellers in Stores chart, resulting in its addition to the &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot; chart. It also reached number one on the &quot;Most Played in Jukeboxes&quot; R&amp;B chart. After seven weeks on the chart, it peaked at number eight on the overall Best Sellers in Stores chart, and by February 19 had hit number one on all the major R&amp;B charts. It remained a number one R&amp;B hit for three weeks, before being dethroned by Johnny Ace&#x27;s &quot;Pledging My Love&quot;.

At the time, it was a rare achievement for an R&amp;B song to chart within the top echelons of the pop chart. The Penguins were the first West Coast R&amp;B group to dent the pop top ten. In May 1955, Dootsie Williams was presented with a gold record to celebrate the record selling 1 million copies (it was reported that nearly 200,000 copies of &quot;Earth Angel&quot; were sold in Southern California alone). With the popularity of the song &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot;, the single saw revived sales in summer 1956. When the Penguins switched to Mercury Records, the label reissued &quot;Earth Angel&quot; in September 1956 with string accompaniment. The following July, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the single was again breaking out in certain markets, remarking, &quot;This wax breaks out every summer.&quot; It made another appearance at #101 in late December 1959. Indeed, &quot;Billboard&quot; confirmed the single&#x27;s enduring popularity in 1960: &quot;The original version of &#x27;Earth Angel,&#x27; for example, is still known to be a heavy traffic item in many areas.&quot; By 1963, Williams had told &quot;Billboard&quot; the single had passed the 2,000,000 mark, and it was reported to be the top-selling single of Dootone Records (at this period renamed Dooto). The same year, it was reported that thousands of bogus copies of &quot;Earth Angel&quot; were attempted to be sold by an unidentified counterfeiter.

The song has continued to sell multiple decades after its release; in 1983, for example, it was still selling thousands of copies per week around the world. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Penguins&#x27; recording of &quot;Earth Angel&quot; has sold over 10 million copies. Its exact figures are uncertain; the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; wrote that the single has sold &quot;perhaps as many as 20 million records, remaining one of the more popular records of all time.&quot;

==Legal issues==
Group members later engaged in a dispute with Dootsie Williams regarding royalties. By mid-January 1955, the Penguins reportedly did not receive advances from Dootone, and problems began to arise. They hired Buck Ram, a big band-era veteran, to manage the group; he later took partial credit for the song&#x27;s success despite that he only began managing the group after its release. On April 9, 1955, the Penguins signed with Mercury Records. Ram had directed the group to Mercury, slyly using his power as a representative to get the Platters, another L.A.-based vocal group, signed as well. Dootone had previously confirmed to trades that their recording contract with the Penguins spanned three years. A court decision found this contract was invalid as three of the four members of the group were minors at the time of their signing. Curtis Williams sued Dootone for $100,000, claiming damages as a result of his underage signing. Dootone countersued, claiming Mercury induced the group to break their Dootone contract and for taking the publishing rights of &quot;Earth Angel&quot;. Jesse Belvin and supposed co-writer Johnny Green sued the group the same week for not receiving credit for writing the song; all early versions of &quot;Earth Angel&quot; (including the covers by the Crew Cuts and others) showed Curtis Williams as the sole author.

Dootsie Williams sued and was awarded the rights to the song in 1957 by the Los Angeles Superior Court &quot;on the ground that Belvin and Hodge had written most of it.&quot; BMI officially lists the writers of &quot;Earth Angel&quot; as Jesse Belvin, Gaynel Hodge and Curtis Williams.

==Cover versions and in popular culture==
&quot;Earth Angel&quot; repeatedly has been covered in popular culture. As was a common occurrence at the time, there were a number of cover versions released upon the record&#x27;s immediate success. Many white artists covered the song, including Gloria Mann, Pat O&#x27;Day, and Les Baxter. The most notable of these was performed by a vocal group from Canada named the Crew-Cuts, signed to Mercury Records. Their version peaked at number three on the pop charts, higher than the original. Their version also reached British charts, a feat the original was unable to achieve. Elvis Presley recorded an informal cover during an army stint in Goethestrasse, Germany. &quot;The Flying Saucer&quot; (1956), widely considered one of the early mashup songs, sampled the song without permission. Other cover versions include those by The Southlanders, Johnny Tillotson, the Cleftones, the Vogues, New Edition, the Temptations, Joan Baez, Bella Morte, Johnny Preston, and Death Cab for Cutie. In Sri Lanka, the popular FM radio channel Shree FM made a cover version titled &quot;Yanna oba yanna&quot;, sung by Samitha Mudunkotuwa in the early 2000s. American rock band the Wallies released a version in 2013. Australian group Human Nature covered the song on their 2014 album &quot;Jukebox&quot;.

In addition to cover versions, the song has been employed in various film and television soundtracks. The 1991 film &quot;Earth Angel&quot; was named after the song. The song has been used in the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot;. It was featured prominently in the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (performed by Harry Waters Jr. as Marvin Berry &amp; the Starlighters) as well as &quot;Superman III&quot; and &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;. It is used in the jukebox musical &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; and also briefly in the film version. The 3rd act of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Meet the Quagmires&quot; has Brian playing guitar and the rest of the band performing the song, which Lois really enjoys stating &quot;Oh, I love this song&quot;. After the song ends, the dancers all applaud the band.

==Legacy==
Although the Penguins never matched the success of their debut single, the song has continued to see popularity and acclaim. Cleveland Duncan, the song&#x27;s lead vocalist, remarked &quot;I never get tired of singing it, as long as people never get tired of hearing it.&quot; The song became a staple of oldies radio in the late 20th century.

An appraisal in the book &quot;Singles&quot; dubs the song &quot;a simple but elegant recording now judged by many to be one of the finest examples of what would become doo-wop&quot;. Despite the higher success of the cover by the Crew-Cuts, the original amateur recording by the Penguins is now considered definitive. Steve Sullivan, author of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings&quot;, writes that the track &quot;possesses virtually all of the qualities cherished by doo-wop lovers: melodic beauty, a shimmering earnest lead vocal, stripped-to-the-bone simplicity, and a pristine romantic innocence.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;For many the song evokes a glittering, timeless vision of proms, sock hops and impossibly young love&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; concurred, calling it a &quot;nostalgic evocation of post-World War II youth culture.&quot; Steve Propes, an author and music historian, remarked that &quot;It was the first of the ultra-romantic ballads that hit the nerve of teens at the time ... It stood out because of the sincerity of the delivery.&quot;

The Penguins&#x27; version was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later placed it at number 152 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and called it &quot;a pivotal record in the early development of rock &amp; roll. The artless, unaffected vocals of the Penguins, four black high schoolers from L.A., defined the street-corner elegance of doo-wop.&quot;

A 1997 listener poll by New York radio station WCBS placed &quot;Earth Angel&quot; just behind the Five Satins&#x27; &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; in a list of most enduring doo-wop songs. In 1973, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that many considered &quot;Earth Angel&quot; among the early rock and roll hits, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;its rhythmic, wailing plea to an idealized young woman captured the spirit of the just-emerging rock generation.&quot; In 2005, it was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, deeming it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot;.

In July 2016, British rock band Coldplay played the song in concert in New Jersey with Michael J. Fox, star of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, on guitar, in a tribute to the film.

<text>Calvin Northrup Mooers (October 24, 1919 – December 1, 1994), was an American computer scientist known for his work in information retrieval and for the programming language TRAC.

==Early life==

Mooers was a native of Minneapolis, Minnesota, attended the University of Minnesota, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1941. He worked at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory from 1941 to 1946, and then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics and physics. At M.I.T. he developed a mechanical system using superimposed codes of descriptors for information retrieval called Zatocoding. He founded the Zator Company in 1947 to market this idea, and pursued work in information theory, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence.

He coined the term &quot;information retrieval&quot;, using it first in a conference paper presented in March 1950. See also a short paper published later that year from Mooers.

==Mooers&#x27;s law==
He coined &quot;Mooers&#x27;s law&quot; (not to be confused with Moore&#x27;s law) and its corollary in 1959:
:An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it.
:Where an information retrieval system tends not to be used, a more capable information retrieval system may tend to be used even less.

==TRAC==
He founded the Rockford Research Institute in 1961, where he developed the TRAC programming language, and attempted to control its distribution and development using trademark law and a unique invocation of
copyright. (At the time patent law would not allow him to control what he saw as his intellectual property and profit from it.) The trademark strategy was later used by Ada.

==Awards==
Mooers received the American Society for Information Science&#x27;s Award of Merit in 1978. The citation reads in part:
:He was a participant in early developmental work on digital computers, a researcher, author, and implementer of applications in information retrieval; and a prophet in the 1950s describing the future importance of what is now called computer networks and distributive processing, and daring to predict that machines could simulate thought processes in retrieving computerized information. In 1947, he proposed the Zator, an electronic, film-scanning retrieval machine, and made the first proposal to use the Boolean operations or, and, and not to prescribe selections in retrieval machines. He developed his own Zatocoding System in 1948 using superimposed subject codes on edge-notched cards. He coined the term &quot;Information Retrieval&quot; in 1950, and went on from there to obtain several patents in information retrieval and signaling, produce a text-handling language (TRAC), author some 200 publications, and form one of the first companies whose only concern was information. His thinking has affected all who are in the field of Information and his early ideas are now incorporated into today&#x27;s reality.

==Death==
Mooers died in 1994 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mooers&#x27;s article critical of John Vincent Atanasoff and his brief tenure as chief of a failed computer construction project at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory during World War II, was published posthumously in the May–June 2001 issue of &quot;IEEE Annals of the History of Computing&quot;.

<text>An emergency shelter is a place for people to live temporarily when they cannot live in their previous residence, similar to homeless shelters. The main difference is that an emergency shelter typically specializes in people fleeing a specific type of situation, such as natural or man-made disasters, domestic violence, or victims of sexual abuse. A more minor difference is that people staying in emergency shelters are more likely to stay all day, except for work, school, or errands, while homeless shelters usually expect people to stay elsewhere during the day, returning only to sleep or eat. Emergency shelters sometimes facilitate support groups, and/or provide meals.

Post-disaster emergency shelter is often provided by organizations or governmental emergency management departments, in response to natural disasters, such as a flood or earthquake. They tend to use tents or other temporary structures, or buildings normally used for another purpose, such as a church or school. These settlements may be inhabited for the entire duration of the reconstruction process and should be thought of more as settlements than shelter, and need to be planned with respect to water / sanitation, livelihoods.

A newer category of emergency shelter is the warming center. Warming centers typically open during particularly cold or rainy nights. They are available to persons who decline to accept homeless shelters, are not allowed to use homeless shelters, or are not homeless, but have inadequate or malfunctioning heat in their homes.

==Mass emergency shelters==
One example of a mass emergency shelter is the Louisiana Superdome, which was used as a hurricane shelter during Hurricane Katrina. More than 20,000 storm refugees crowded into the arena seeking sanctuary from the winds and waters of Katrina, filling seats, ramps, corridors, and the artificial turf field. The refugees were met with a myriad of new challenges, including stifling heat, stench, filth, unsanitary facilities, and a shortage of food and drinking water. Violent assaults and rapes were reported, as well as one unconfirmed suicide.

== Sustainable design ==
Sustainable design is often employed in response to global environmental crises, the rapid growth of economic activity and human population, depletion of natural resources, damage to ecosystems, and loss of biodiversity. In 2013, eco architecture writer Bridgette Meinhold surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book &quot;Urgent Architecture: 40 Sustainable Housing Solutions for a Changing World&quot;. Featured projects focus on green building, sustainable design, eco-friendly materials, affordability, material reuse, and humanitarian relief. Construction methods and materials include repurposed shipping containers, straw bale construction, sandbag homes, and floating homes.

<doc id="762095" wikidata="Q111986484" url="?curid=762095" title="Isles-class trawler">
<text>The Isles-class trawlers were a class of naval trawler used by the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy during World War II.

The type comprised 197 vessels built between 1939 and 1945 in the nearly identical Isles, , and classes. Generally similar to the s of 1916–1918, though somewhat larger, they were mainly used on minesweeping and harbour defence duties. Most were armed with one 12-pounder gun (76 mm) and three or four 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns with 30 depth charges. In the Dance class a 4-inch AA gun (102 mm) was fitted in place of the 12 pdr, and there were six 20 mm Oerlikons in &quot;Annet&quot;, &quot;Bressay&quot;, &quot;Damsay&quot;, &quot;Fiaray&quot;, &quot;Foulness&quot; and &quot;Lindisfarne&quot;. Four of the trawlers were given &quot;bird&quot; names when converted to controlled minelayers in 1943–44: &quot;Blackbird&quot; (M15), &quot;Dabchick&quot; (M22), &quot;Stonechat&quot; (M25) and &quot;Whitethroat&quot; (M03). A total of 23 of these trawlers were lost during the war. Six trawlers were loaned to Canada in 1942-45 and five to Norway in 1943–45.

Postwar, 17 of the trawlers were disarmed as wreck disposal vessels: &quot;Bardsey&quot; (DV13), &quot;Bern&quot; (DV4), &quot;Caldy&quot; (DV5) &quot;Coll&quot; (DV6), &quot;Earraid&quot; (DV7), &quot;Fetlar&quot; (DV8), &quot;Flatholm&quot; (DV9), &quot;Graemsay&quot; (DV10), &quot;Lindisfarne&quot; (DV11), &quot;Lundy&quot; (DV12), &quot;Neave&quot; (DV14), &quot;Scalpay&quot; (DV15), &quot;Skomer&quot; (DV16), &quot;Steepholm&quot; (DV17), &quot;Switha&quot; (DV18), &quot;Tiree&quot; (DV19), and &quot;Trondra&quot; (DV20). At least five were employed as danlayers (laying and retrieving dan buoys during minesweeping operations): &quot;Imersay&quot; (J422), &quot;Sandray&quot; (J424), &quot;Shillay&quot; (J426), &quot;Sursay&quot; (J427) and &quot;Tocogay&quot; (J451). After decommissioning, &quot;Switha&quot; and &quot;Coll&quot; were converted to oil tank cleaning vessels for dockyard service in 1949–50.

By 1949 there remained in service of this type 31 trawlers and four controlled minelayers in the Royal Navy, one controlled minelayer in the Royal Canadian Navy, and four trawlers in the Royal New Zealand Navy. An additional 16 were in service in the Italian Navy and six in the Portuguese Navy. Most of the surviving Royal Navy examples were discarded in the 1950s, but a few remained until the 1960s. Two acquired postwar by the Federal German Navy remained in service as training vessels well into the 1970s, with one, &quot;Trave&quot; (ex-&quot;Dochet&quot;), resold to Turkey for further service in 1977.

<doc id="762103" wikidata="Q337467" url="?curid=762103" title="Antonov An-24">
<text>The Antonov An-24 (Russian/Ukrainian: Антонов Ан-24) (NATO reporting name: Coke) is a 44-seat twin turboprop transport/passenger aircraft designed in 1957 in the Soviet Union by the Antonov Design Bureau and manufactured by the Kyiv, Irkutsk and Ulan-Ude Aviation Factories. It was the first of a future family of turboprops by Antonov. The An-30 came next with a cartographic configuration, then the An-26 with a military configuration and the An-32 modernized version. The An-132 was intended to be the next member of the An-24 family, but Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Taqnia left the project and canceled their orders and the only prototype was destroyed, which led to the project being canceled. A Chinese licensed-built version, the Xi&#x27;an Y-7, is heavily based on the An-24, but is not a member of the family.

==Design and development==


First flown in 1959, the An-24 was produced in some 1,000 units of various versions; in 2023 there are 93 still in service worldwide, mostly in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Africa.

It was designed to replace the veteran piston Ilyushin Il-14 transport on short to medium haul trips, optimised for operating from rough strips and unprepared airports in remote locations. The high-wing layout protects engines and blades from debris, the power-to-weight ratio is higher than that of many comparable aircraft and the machine is rugged, requiring minimal ground support equipment.

Due to its rugged airframe and good performance, the An-24 was adapted to perform many secondary missions such as ice reconnaissance and engine/propeller test-bed, as well as further development to produce the An-26 tactical transport, An-30 photo-mapping/survey aircraft and An-32 tactical transport with more powerful engines. Various projects were envisaged such as a four jet short/medium haul airliner and various iterations of powerplant.

The main production line was at the Kyiv-Svyatoshino (later renamed &quot;Aviant&quot;) aircraft production plant which built 985, with 180 built at Ulan Ude and a further 197 An-24T tactical transport/freighters at Irkutsk. Production in the USSR was shut down by 1978.

Production continues at China&#x27;s Xi&#x27;an Aircraft Industrial Corporation which makes licensed, reverse-engineered and redesigned aircraft as the Xian Y-7, and its derivatives. Manufacture of the Y-7, in civil form, has now been supplanted by the MA60 derivative with western engines and avionics, to improve performance and economy, and widen the export appeal.

The aircraft introduced in Mongolia was initially planned to be used by the air force, but was eventually handed over to a private airline company for use, and some were later used in research facilities. Since then, as the aircraft has deteriorated, it has been stored in Ulaanbaatar.

===Total production===
==Variants==

===Prototype===
;An-24
: This was the first production aircraft, with a total of six built between 1959 and 1961. It was primarily used for testing the aircraft&#x27;s instruments and landing gear, and was also used for ground tests and de-icing tests.

===Produced aircraft===
;An-24
:17 were built.This was the first production model, separate from the prototypes built between 1959 and 1961. It was approved for production on 19 August 1961, and test engineering flights with passengers took place in September 1962. It entered service between Kiev and Kherson on 31 October 1962.Later, it was decided to replace them with improved models, and all of them were exported to Cuba and used as military transports by the Cuban Air Force. After being used as transports to replace the An-2, two were released to civilian airlines.
;An-24A
:200 were built (9 in 1962, 191 in 1963) of this improved version, delivered directly from the Kiev factory. It seated 44 passengers and had a larger interior volume. In addition, the APU exhaust was moved to the tip of the starboard nacelle. This was the second time the designation was used.
;An-24B
: 400 aircraft were built in the second production version. A passenger version with seating for up to 52. Maximum takeoff weight was increased to 21 tonnes, a window was added on each side, the double slotted flaps were replaced with single slotted flaps, and the centre chord was extended to compensate for the poor performance of the flaps. Some aircraft were delivered with four additional fuel bladders in the centre wing. Production began in 1964.

;An-24T (&quot;Transportnyy&quot; – transport)
: This is the second time this name has been used for a tactical transport aircraft. It is equipped with a ventral loading hatch, a cargo winch, and an escape hatch behind the nose landing gear, and its mission is to transport airborne troops and infantry to frontline bases.
;An-24RT (&quot;Reaktivnyy [Uskoritel&#x27;] Transportnyy&quot; – boosted transport)
: Similar to the AN-24T, fitted with an auxiliary turbojet engine.
;An-24PRT (&quot;Poiskovo-spasahtel&#x27;nyy Reaktivnyy [Uskoritel&#x27;] Transportnyy&quot; – SAR boosted transport)
: The An-24RT was the basis for the search and rescue aircraft, of which 11 were manufactured, and was fitted with rescue equipment and exploration devices in the cabin. Both were considered important due to their ability to stay in the air.
;An-24RV (&quot;Reaktivnyy [Uskoritel&#x27;] V&quot; – boosted V)
:Turbojet boosted export version, similar to the An-24V but fitted with a 1,985-lb (8830 N) thrust auxiliary turbojet engine in the starboard nacelle.
;An-24ShT (&quot;Shtabnoy Transportnyy&quot; – Staff/HQ transport)
: A tactical Airborne Command Post for use by commanders, also capable of forming ground-based communications and HQ.

;An-24TV (&quot;Transportnyy V&quot; – transport V)
:The export cargo version of the An-24T.

;An-24V
: An export version of the An-24B, equipped with an AI-24T (SrsII) turboprop engine, available in early and late models. The early model has narrow in-chord wings, double slotted flaps, and a single ventral fin. The later model has a single slotted flap, twin ventral fins, and a modified interior to allow cargo to be carried in addition to passengers. Production began in 1964.

;An-24VSR
: A navigation trainer aircraft that was operated in 1965 by modifying a single An-24V aircraft and was intended to train pilots in radio communication.

===Special mission aircraft===

;An-24ALK (&quot;Avtomatizeerovannaya [sistema] Lyotnovo Kontrolya&quot; – automatic flight check system)
: A single retired passenger An-24A was converted into a satellite observation aircraft for use in navigation satellite calibration missions. It was renamed An-24LR &quot;Toros&quot; for air defense surveillance, but was later modified again and redesignated An-24ALK. The aircraft was equipped with a phototheodolite and a powerful light source for optical sensors.

;An-24LL (&quot;Letyushchaya Laboratoriya&quot; – flying laboratory)
: A single An-24A, decommissioned from passenger transport duty, was converted into an airborne experimental aircraft. The generic suffix LL can apply to any testbed, but in the case of the An-24, it stands for metrology (the science of measurement), which is used to test the airworthiness of production aircraft.

;An-24LP (&quot;LesoPozharnyy&quot; – forest fire fighter)
: Three An-24RV aircraft converted into fire bombers/cloud seeders by installing a tank in the cabin, optical smoke and flame detectors, provision for a thermal imager, racks for carrying flare dispensers and the ability to carry firefighters for para-dropping.

;An-24LR-1 &#x27;Toros&#x27; (Ice Hummock)(&quot;Ledovyy Razvedchik&quot; – ice reconnaissance)
: At least two An-24Bs converted to carry the &#x27;Toros&#x27; SLAR (sideways looking airborne radar) either side of the lower fuselage, for ice reconnaissance, guiding icebreakers, convoys and other shipping.

;An-24LR-2 &#x27;Nit&#x27; (Thread)
:An observation aircraft type for surveying the natural resources of the earth and oceans of the world, modified from a single An-24B in 1978. Equipped with a large &quot;Nit&quot; SLAR pod on the side of the lower fuselage. 

;An-24PS (&quot;Poiskovo-Spasahtel&#x27;nyy&quot; – SAR)
: A single An-24B aircraft converted for search and rescue duties, rejected after acceptance trials in favour of a derivative of the An-24RT.

;An-24PRT
: A search and rescue aircraft built from 12 modified An-24As. Some equipment was omitted to reduce production costs, but this did not hinder rescue operations.

;An-24R 
:It was a prototype photo reconnaissance aircraft created by modifying a single An-24A, but since the An-30 was superior overall, it ended up serving as a test aircraft and was used to test the photographic cameras to be installed on the An-30.

;An-24RR (&quot;[samolyot] Radiotsionnyy Razvedchik&quot; – radiation reconnaissance [aircraft])
: Four aircraft converted as Nuclear, biological and chemical warfare reconnaissance versions of the An-24B, carrying RR8311-100 air sampling pods low on the forward fuselage and a sensor pod on a pylon on the port fuselage side.

;An-24RT (&quot;Retranslyator&quot; – relay installation)
: A few An-24T and An-24RT aircraft converted to Communications relay aircraft. Sometimes referred to as An-24Rt to differentiate from the An-24RT.

;An-24T &#x27;Troyanda&#x27; (Ukrainian – rose)
: An experimental aircraft created in 1968 by removing the winch and measuring equipment from an An-24T.From the 1960s the Soviet Union was faced with nuclear submarine threats that were virtually undetectable with the technology available. To assist in the development of advanced optical, chemical, sonic, infra-red and electromagnetic detection systems, several aircraft were built or modified as test-beds. One significant aircraft was the An-24T &#x27;Troyanda&#x27; which was built new, for the development of sonobuoy and infra-red detection systems. As well as equipment inside the cabin, sensors could be mounted in large teardrop fairings either side of the lower forward fuselage, and extra equipment could be carried in extended wing centre-section fairings.

;An-24USh (&quot;Uchebno-Shturmanskiy (samolyot)&quot; – Navigator training aircraft)
: Seven An-24Bs were converted to An-24USh navigator/air traffic controller trainers with five training stations and four standard rows of seats for trainees in waiting. Outwardly the USh was distinguishable by the bulged windows at each training station.

;An-24AEW
:In the early 1990s, North Korea installed N-019 Topaz pulse-Doppler radars on at least one of its An-24A aircraft in an attempt to achieve a rudimentary Airborne Early Warning capability.

===Ended as a plan only===
;An-24A
:The aircraft was originally intended to be produced using the Kuznetsov NK-4 turboprop engine, but production was halted when the NK-4 was cancelled. The name was later reused for a production version using a different engine.

;An-24D
: A projected long-range airliner version of the An-24B with a single RU-19 booster jet engine in the starboard nacelle, stretched fuselage with seating for 60, strengthened structure and increased fuel capacity.

;An-24K
: An 18-seater civilian transport aircraft that was supposed to be operated by a private company&#x27;s management design department, but it never reached the concept stage.

;An-24AT
: A 1962 project for a Tactical transport with rear loading ramp and powered by Isotov TV2-117DS coupled turboprops.

;An-24AT-RD (RD – &quot;Reaktivnyye Dvigateli&quot; – jet engines)
: The An-24AT tactical transport project with two turbojet boosters pod-mounted under the outer wings and a wider loading ramp.
;An-24AT-U (&quot;Uskoriteli&quot; – boosters)
: A projected Tactical transport from 1966 with three or five PRD-63 (&quot;Porokhovoy Raketnyy Dvigatel&quot; – gunpowder rocket engine) JATO bottles, wider cargo ramp and provision for up to three brake parachutes.

;An-24T (&quot;Transportnyy&quot; – transport)
: (first use) Tactical transport version, rejected due to poor field performance and range, together with inability to load or air-drop vehicles during acceptance testing.

===Advanced===
;An-26
: Tactical transport with cargo ramp.
;An-30
: Survey/photo-mapping aircraft.
;An-32
: Designed to withstand adverse weather conditions better than the standard An-26.
;An-34
: The initial designation of the An-24T production tactical transport.
;An-44
: Projected cargo aircraft developed from the An-24. Ice reconnaissance and transport versions were also planned.
;An-50
: A mid-1960s project for a jet-powered An-24, with four Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engines in podded pairs, pylon mounted forward of the wings. Not proceeded with due to competition from the Yak-40.
;Xian Y-7
: The Y-7 is a Chinese built derivative of the An-24/An-26 family.
;MA60
:Upgraded and Westernised Y-7.
