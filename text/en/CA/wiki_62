<text>John Bennett Johnston Jr. (born June 10, 1932) is a retired American attorney, politician, and later lobbyist from Louisiana who served in both chambers of the Louisiana State Legislature as member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1964 to 1968, a member of the Louisiana State Senate from 1968 to 1972, and a member of the United States Senate from 1972 to 1997. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

Beginning his political career when elected as a state representative from Caddo Parish in 1964, Johnston also served in the state senate before winning election to the U.S. Senate.

==Early life and education==
Johnston was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, to the attorney John Bennett Johnston (1894–1977) and the former Wilma Lyon (1904–1996).

After Southfield, Johnston attended and graduated from C. E. Byrd High School in Shreveport. He attended the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, and Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

In 1956, Johnston graduated from Paul M. Hebert Law Center of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was then admitted to the bar that same year. Johnston attended The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Legal Center and School at the University of Virginia and entered United States Army Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. He served in the United States Army, Judge Advocate General Corps in Germany from 1956 to 1959.

==Marriage and family==

Johnston married Mary Hunter Gunn, a native of Natchitoches, Louisiana, on August 11, 1956, in her hometown. Johnston is a member of the Baptist Church; and his wife is Roman Catholic. They had four children together: Bennett, Hunter, Mary, and Sally, who were raised as Catholic.
Their daughter Sally married Tim Roemer from Indiana. He became a politician, serving as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana, from 1991 to 2003. He was appointed to the 9/11 Commission to investigate the terrorist attacks. He also served as United States Ambassador to India.
They have a total of 10 grandchildren.

==Political life==

Johnston had joined the Democratic Party and decided to run for office, beginning at the local level. In 1964, he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. 

In 1966, Johnston hired Ralph Perlman to the legislative staff; he was a business graduate of Columbia University in New York City. Soon Governor of Louisiana John McKeithen appointed Perlman as state budget director, where he served from 1967 to 1988.

In 1970, State Senator Johnston outlined his proposal for a toll road to connect Shreveport with South Louisiana, as there was no north–south interstate highway at the time. Johnston said the state gasoline tax was bringing in only 20 percent of what was needed to construct such a north–south highway. Therefore, he proposed using tolls to raise the necessary revenue, as they applied only to users. While his proposal was not approved, later the federally subsidized Interstate 49 was built, linking Shreveport with Lafayette. Most of the highway was opened in the early 1990s. Interstate connections were created from Lafayette to Baton Rouge and New Orleans.

=== Campaigns for governor ===
In 1971, Johnston ran for Governor of Louisiana. Harmon Drew Jr. headed the Johnston college campaign. Drew said that Johnston represented a &quot;new outlook this state must have.&quot; Johnston narrowly lost this race by 4,488 votes to Edwin Edwards in the runoff election of the Democratic primary. This was the last Louisiana gubernatorial election to be held prior to the state&#x27;s adoption of the nonpartisan blanket primary in 1975. Edwards&#x27; margin was fewer than two votes per precinct. Drew later served as a judge of the Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal, for the second circuit

Edwards defeated Republican David C. Treen in the general election for governor held on February 1, 1972. Treen was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 1972. He was re-elected, serving until his election as governor in 1979.

==U.S. Senate campaigns==
In 1972, Johnston challenged the long-term incumbent, Allen J. Ellender, for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. Ellender died during the campaign, and Johnston, with powerful name identification stemming from his gubernatorial bid months earlier, won the primary easily. In the primary, Johnston received 623,076 votes (79.4 percent); Frank T. Allen, 88,198 votes (11.2 percent), and the deceased Ellender, 73,088 votes (9.3 percent).

Johnston defeated Republican Ben C. Toledano, a New Orleans attorney and a former candidate for Mayor of New Orleans, and former Governor John McKeithen of Columbia, a fellow Democrat who ran as an Independent in the general election because the filing period was not reopened upon Ellender&#x27;s death.

McKeithen, the first Louisiana governor to serve two consecutive terms, left office six months prior to the Senate election in order to conduct his campaign.

The creation of the interim position was done to swear in Johnston immediately upon certification of his election, allowing him to gain an edge in seniority over other senators who first took office during the 93rd Congress. Johnston&#x27;s freshman classmates included Joe Biden (D-Delaware), who served seven terms before being elected as Vice President and later President, Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), who served four terms, Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina), who served five terms, and Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico), who served six terms.

For a time, Johnston&#x27;s director of special projects was James Arthur Reeder (1933–2012), a former Shreveport and Washington, D.C., attorney, and owner of a chain of radio stations. Like Johnston, Reeder was later inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Later Reeder organized voter registration drives in Caddo Parish to empower minority voters. In 2009, Reeder narrated the inaugural parade of U.S. President Barack H. Obama.

In 1978, Johnston defeated Democratic State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge in the nonpartisan blanket primary, 498,773 (59.4 percent) to 340,896 (40.6 percent). (Jenkins later shifted to the Republican Party.)

The HUD Secretary at the time, Jack Kemp, also endorsed Johnston.

Johnston defeated Duke in the primary, 752,902 votes (53.9 percent), to 607,391 votes (43.5 percent), far less than expected. Other candidates took the remaining 35,820 votes (2.5 percent).
Johnston retired after his fourth term ended in 1997; he was succeeded by his choice for the seat, fellow Democrat Mary Landrieu of New Orleans, daughter of Jimmy Carter&#x27;s HUD Secretary and former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu.

Johnston&#x27;s closest re-election race was in 1990 against State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan man and Republican candidate, who was not endorsed by his party&#x27;s leadership. Louisiana State Senator Ben Bagert of New Orleans dropped out of the primary race in a bid to try to prevent a runoff battle between Johnston and Duke. Eight Republican U.S. senators endorsed Johnston over Duke. These included Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski of Alaska, David Durenberger and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, John Danforth of Missouri, William Cohen of Maine, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.

==Notable achievements ==
Johnston broke with his party in 1991 to authorize the use of military force in the Gulf War in Iraq. He also broke ranks to support the narrowly achieved confirmation of Clarence Thomas as associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. In 1987, Johnston had voted with his Democratic majority against President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s choice of Robert Bork, former D.C. Appeals Court Judge, for elevation to the Supreme Court.

Johnston was one of the few Senate Democrats to vote against the Budget Act of 1993, which was strongly supported by President Bill Clinton. He repeatedly voted against the Balanced Budget Amendment and giving the President the line-item veto, both of which were measures strongly favored by fiscal conservatives in both parties. On foreign policy issues, he frequently voted with more liberal Democrats to terminate restrictions on travel to communist Cuba, and in support of the United Nations and foreign aid. Johnston was the only member of either house of Congress to vote against a 1995 resolution to allow Taiwan&#x27;s president Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States.

During his tenure as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, he was recognized as the nation&#x27;s pre-eminent legislator on energy policy. One of his major concerns was the threat of anthropegenic climate change.

Johnston was a firm advocate of the Flag Desecration Amendment. He opposed abortion and most gun control measures.

In 1988, Johnston sought the position of Senate Majority Leader but lost to George J. Mitchell of Maine. From 1972 to 1987, Johnston served alongside fellow Democratic Senator Russell B. Long, with whom he worked closely to deliver federal spending to Louisiana. Johnston and Long gained authorization of the Cane River National Heritage Area in Natchitoches Parish in 1994, which stimulated tourism in the region. Johnston delivered a eulogy at Long&#x27;s funeral in 2003.

==Later life==
Since leaving the Senate, Johnston formed Johnston &amp; Associates LLC, a lobbying group. In 2008, Steptoe &amp; Johnson, a major international law firm, formed a &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with Johnston. Steptoe added three members from Johnston &amp; Associates to the firm.

Johnston and former U.S. senator Howard Baker of Tennessee co-chaired the National Parks Second Century Commission.

In 1997, Johnston was elected to the board of directors of Chevron Corporation. He had left the board by 2011.

Currently, Johnston is one of the advisory directors at Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold and Angeleno Group, an energy-based investment group.

<doc id="774309" wikidata="Q1452550" url="?curid=774309" title="Fred Waring">
<text>Fredrick Malcolm Waring Sr. (June 9, 1900 – July 29, 1984) was an American musician, bandleader, choral director, and radio and television personality, sometimes referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Singing Master&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Taught America How to Sing&quot;. He was also a promoter, financial backer and eponym of the Waring Blendor, the first modern electric blender on the market. 

== Biography ==
Fredrick Malcolm Waring was born in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, on June 9, 1900, to Jesse Calderwood and Frank Waring. During his teen years, Waring, his brother Tom &quot;(né&quot; Thomas Lincoln Waring; 1902–1960), and their friend Poley McClintock founded the Waring-McClintock Snap Orchestra, which evolved into Fred Waring&#x27;s Banjo Orchestra. The band often played at fraternity parties, proms, and dances, and achieved local success.

Waring attended Penn State University, where he studied architectural engineering. He aspired to be in the Penn State Glee Club, but he was rejected with every audition. His Banjo Orchestra became so successful that he decided to abandon his education to tour with the band, which eventually became known as Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians.

He married Dorothy McAteer, his college sweetheart, in 1923 but divorced her in 1929. He remarried in 1933 to Evelyn Nair (1910–2004); the couple had three children, Dixie, Fred Jr., and William. They divorced in 1954, following which Waring married Virginia Clotfelter (died 2013), adopted Virginia&#x27;s son Paul from her previous marriage, and fathered a son, Malcolm. Fred Waring Jr. was a conductor and jazz trombonist. Grandson Jordan Waring is an orchestral composer.

== Career ==
=== Records and radio ===
In 1922, Waring’s band attracted attention at a University of Michigan student festival in a gymnasium in Ann Arbor, Mich., leading to a six-week booking at a local theater. That engagement led to bookings in Detroit and other large cities, launching Waring’s national career.

From 1923 until late 1932, &quot;Waring&#x27;s Pennsylvanians&quot; were among Victor Records&#x27; bestselling bands. In late 1932, Waring abruptly quit recording, although his band continued to perform on radio. In 1933, &quot;You Gotta Be a Football Hero&quot; was performed on radio to great acclaim. His 1930 recording of &quot;Love for Sale&quot; by Cole Porter is one of the few period versions of this popular song.

&quot;The Fred Waring Show&quot; was heard on radio in various forms from 1933 to 1957.

Adding a men&#x27;s singing group to his ensemble, he recruited Robert Shaw, recently out of the Pomona College glee club, to train his singers. Shaw later founded the Robert Shaw Chorale and directed the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. Pembroke Davenport (1911–1985) was Waring&#x27;s pianist and arranger.

During World War II, Waring and his ensemble appeared at war bond rallies and entertained the troops at training camps. He composed and performed dozens of patriotic songs, his most famous being &quot;My America&quot;. In 1943, he acquired the Buckwood Inn in Shawnee on Delaware, Pennsylvania, and renamed the resort the Shawnee Inn. To promote the inn, he centered his musical activities at the inn itself. He created, rehearsed, and broadcast his radio programs from the stage of Shawnee&#x27;s Worthington Hall throughout the 1950s.

During the 1940s and early 1950s, Waring and His Pennsylvanians produced a string of hits, selling millions of records. A few of his many choral hits include &quot;Sleep&quot;, &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Button Up Your Overcoat&quot;, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, &quot;Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor&quot;, and &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;. In 1964 he recorded two albums with Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby: &quot;America, I Hear You Singing&quot; and &quot;12 Songs of Christmas&quot;, for Sinatra&#x27;s Reprise label.

The song, &quot;Breezin&#x27; Along with the Breeze&quot; was used as a signature tune by Fred Waring.

=== Choral workshops ===
In 1947, Waring organized the Fred Waring Choral Workshop at his Pennsylvania headquarters in the old Castle Inn in Delaware Water Gap, Pennsylvania, which was also the home of Shawnee Press, the music publisher which he founded. At these sessions, musicians learned to sing with precision, sensitivity, and enthusiasm. When these vocalists returned home and shared what they had learned with fellow musicians, Waring&#x27;s approach to choral singing spread throughout the nation. The first Fred Waring Music Workshop in the western United States was held in June 1968 as part of the University of Nevada&#x27;s Summer Session curriculum in Reno, Nevada. Waring taught and supervised these summer workshop for 37 years until he died.

=== Television ===
Waring expanded into television with &quot;The Fred Waring Show&quot;, which ran on CBS Television from June 20, 1948, to May 30, 1954, and received several awards for Best Musical Program. (The show was 60 minutes long until January 1952, and 30 minutes thereafter.) In the 1960s and 1970s, popular musical tastes turned from choral music, but Waring changed with the times, introducing his Young Pennsylvanians, a group of fresh-faced, long-haired, bell-bottomed performers who sang old favorites and choral arrangements of contemporary songs. In this way he continued as a popular touring attraction, logging some 40,000 miles a year.

=== Waring blender ===

In the 1930s, inventor Frederick Jacob Osius went to Waring for financial backing for an electric blender he had patented. The Osius patent (#2,109,501) was filed March 13, 1937, and awarded March 1, 1938. A patent for the technology was granted in the United States, Canada, and France.

After an initial $25,000 investment, the Waring-owned Miracle Mixer was introduced to the public at the National Restaurant Show in Chicago retailing for $29.75. In 1938, Fred Waring renamed his Miracle Mixer Corporation as the Waring Corporation, and the mixer&#x27;s name was changed to the Waring Blendor (the &quot;o&quot; in blendor giving it a slight distinction from &quot;blender&quot;).

The Waring Blendor became an important tool in hospitals for the implementation of specific diets, as well as a vital scientific research device. Jonas Salk used it while developing his polio vaccine. In 1954, the millionth Waring Blendor was sold.

Waring is now a division of the Conair Corporation.

== Death ==
Waring died of a stroke at his summer home on July 29, 1984, in State College, Pennsylvania, after videotaping a concert with his ensemble and completing his annual summer choral workshop. He conducted many such workshops at Penn State in his later years, and in 1984, designated Penn State to house his collection of archives and memorabilia. He also served his alma mater as a trustee and was named a distinguished alumnus of the university.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1983, the 83-year-old Waring was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation&#x27;s highest honor for a civilian.

Although many believe that Waring Commons at Penn State is named for him, it is actually named for his grandfather, William Waring. Fred Waring Drive is a major arterial road in the Palm Desert–Indio area of Southern California where many major roads are named for post-World War II-era entertainers. Waring Drive in Delaware Water Gap which runs alongside the Castle Inn, Waring&#x27;s base of operations for over 50 years, was named for Waring in 1991. The Waring Golf Course north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was named after Waring, and he had an ownership interest in it. It ceased operation around 1960.

Waring was the Shepherd (president) of The Lambs from 1939 to 1942.

In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

== Comic strip collection ==

Waring was a cartoon and comic strip collector. A Penn State meeting room by the West Wing restaurant has dozens of cartoons drawn by artists such as Al Hirschfeld in Waring&#x27;s honor.

From 1943 to 1974, Waring owned the Shawnee Inn and Country Club, a golf resort located at Shawnee on Delaware, Pennsylvania near Stroudsburg. In 1948, two years after the National Cartoonists Society was formed, Waring invited members of that organization to spend a day at the Shawnee Inn.

<text>Halikko () is a former municipality of Finland that existed until December 31, 2008. On January 1, 2009, the municipality was merged with the larger neighboring [[Salo, Finland|Salo]]. Before the merge Halikko had become a rapidly urbanizing rural area.

It was located in the province of Western Finland and was part of the Southwest Finland region. The municipality had a population of 9,491 (2004-12-31) and covered an area of 357.31 km2 (excluding sea) of which 0.52 km2 was inland water. The population density was 26.60 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish.
==History==
There is evidence that areas in Halikko has been settled in the Stone Age. One of the prehistoric villages, Rikala, became an important trade and meeting place on the Finnish coast during the Iron Age. The vikings sailed to Rikala to trade with the finns. Several Iron Age treasures has been found in Halikko, e.g. the Treasure of Halikko.

In the first centuries of the Swedish rule in Finland, the land was given to the ruling class. Manors of Åminne, Vuorentaka and Wiurila were founded and they became powerful owners in Halikko. The oldest documented record of Halikko is from 1313. The stone church of Halikko was built in 1440.

The municipality of Halikko was formed in 1865 due to the municipal reform. The count of Wiurila became the first municipal manager. In 1932 Halikko had to give land to its growing neighbour Salo. In 1967 the municipality of Angelniemi was merged with Halikko.

On January 1, 2009, Halikko ceased to exist as it was attached to the City of Salo. The territory of the former Halikko thus changed status from rural to urban.

==Name==
The name &quot;Halikko&quot; is mentioned for the first time in 1313. One theory is that the name derives from the Germanic name &quot;Halicho&quot; or &quot;Halik&quot;.

Saulo Kepsu has suggested that the toponym is Finnic in origin, being derived a possible pre-Christian personal name &quot;*Halikka&quot; or &quot;*Halikkoi&quot;, which would be derived from the verb &quot;haluta&quot; (to want).

== Notable people ==

* Count Arvid Bernhard Horn af Ekebyholm (1664 in Vuorentaka Manor – 1742) a Swedish general, diplomat and politician.

<text>Odette Bancilhon (22 September 1908 – 1998) was a French astronomer. She is best known for her work during the 1930s and 1940s at the Algiers Observatory, in Algeria, North Africa, where she discovered 1333 Cevenola, a stony Eunomian asteroid from the main-belt.

== Life and work ==
Bancilhon was a graduate in science and she served as a meteorological assistant in Algiers for one year beginning 1 December 1932. On 7 December 1933, she was appointed as Alfred Schmitt&#x27;s replacement while he performed his military service. In that capacity, in 1934, she discovered the asteroid (1333) Cevenola. (All of her publications at that time were signed &quot;O. Bancilhon&quot;, a practice of her profession.) She was named an assistant on 1 November 1937.

She married her colleague Alfred Schmitt in Algiers on 12 September 1942, and became known professionally as &quot;O. Schmitt-Bancilhon&quot;.

She and her husband were transferred to the Strasbourg Observatory in France on 1 January 1950, and she worked there as an assistant for several years. The couple then moved to the Quito Observatory in Ecuador from 2 October 1956 to 10 April 1958. She was an assistant there while her husband served as observatory director. She retired on 1 July 1964.

The main-belt asteroid 1713 Bancilhon (measuring 5.716 kilometers in diameter) was named in her honor. It was discovered on 27 September 1951 by Louis Boyer, her former colleague at the Algiers Observatory.

<text>The Dassault Mirage 2000N is a variant of the Mirage 2000 designed for nuclear strike. It formed the core of the French air-based strategic nuclear deterrent. The Mirage 2000D is its conventional attack counterpart. Although it looks like a Mirage 2000 trainer, it was actually used as a fighter-attack aircraft.

==Development==

The Mirage 2000N was designed to French requirements for an aircraft to replace the older Mirage IVP. Dassault received a contract to build two prototypes. The aircraft first flew on 3 February 1986. Seventy four were built up to 1993.

The Mirage 2000N is based on the Mirage 2000B two-seat trainer, but features considerable changes. The airframe was strengthened for low-level flight and fitted with an Antilope 5 radar, which is used for terrain following, navigation and ground mapping, and which can follow terrain at . Other avionic features are twin INS units and moving map displays for both the pilot and weapon systems officer. The Mirage 2000N can carry one ASMP medium-range nuclear missile, and can also carry two MATRA Magic AAMs for self-defence. Other protection features include the Sabre jamming system and the Spirale chaff system. Because the extra seat decreases range, a pair of drop tanks are carried. Since the Mirage 2000N&#x27;s standard weapon was the ASMP, which was carried on the centerline pylon, this meant that it could not carry a centerline tank, but a distinctive big 2,000 litre (530 US gallon) underwing drop tank with a bulbous nose was developed to more than compensate.

The first batch of 30 aircraft for the French Air Force had a sole nuclear capability, and these were designated Mirage 2000N-K1. These did not have the Spirale chaff system, and carried a pair of AN.52 free-fall nuclear bombs before the ASMP was ready. The later batch of 44 aircraft were designated Mirage 2000N-K2. These had both a nuclear and conventional capability, and a full defensive fit. The K1 aircraft now have a limited conventional attack capability.

Dassault has also developed the Mirage 2000D, which is a development of the Mirage 2000N designed for long-range precision strikes with conventional weapons. This aircraft is exactly the same as the Mirage 2000N, but introduces support for conventional attack missiles such as the Apache and Scalp missiles, as well as the AASM weapons. The first aircraft, converted from the Mirage 2000N prototype, flew on 19 February 1991, and the French Air Force ordered a total of 86 aircraft.

The Mirage 2000N is not licensed for export. The French Air and Space Force has 62 in its inventory.

Like the Mirage 2000N, the Mirage 2000D had variants. The Mirage 2000D-R1 does not have the full weapons capability of the Mirage 2000D-R2, which features the Apache and Scalp missiles, the ATLIS II laser designation system, and the Samir self-protection fit.

==Operational history==

===Operation Deny Flight and Deliberate Force===

French Mirage 2000s were prominent participants in UN and NATO air operations over the former Yugoslavia. On 30 August 1995 one Mirage 2000N-K2 was shot down over Bosnia by a MANPADS heat-seeking 9K38 Igla missile fired by air defence units of Army of Republika Srpska during operation Deliberate Force, prompting efforts to obtain improved defensive systems.

===Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF===
AdA Mirage 2000Ds served in the intervention in Afghanistan in 2001–2002, operating in close conjunction with international forces and performing precision attacks with LGBs.
The French Air Force deployed the Mirage 2000D to Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan from 2002 to 2004 to support coalition forces in Afghanistan. Then from 2004 to 2007, they stayed at Dushanbe, Tajikistan.
In summer 2007, after the Rafale fighters have been removed from the theater of operations, 3 French Mirage 2000s were deployed to Afghanistan in support of NATO troops.
To shorten the response time to support NATO ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan, the aircraft moved to Kandahar International Airport. Three Rafale F2 and three Mirage 2000Ds operate from Kandahar in 2008.
On 24 May 2011, a French Air Force Mirage 2000D crashed 100 kilometers west of Farah. Both crew members successfully ejected and were recovered.

===Opération Harmattan and Unified Protector===
French Air Force Mirage 2000D were committed since the beginning to the enforcement of the Libyan no-fly-zone that was approved by the UN in March 2011.
The Mirage 2000Ds were among the first strikers: on 19 March 2011, a mixed French formation of Mirage 2000s and Rafales hit a Libyan army column that was heading for Benghazi with several vehicles destroyed.
The Mirage 2000D remained one of the most used striker for the next months when Opération Harmattan was succeeded by the UN led Operation Unified Protector.
On 20 October 2011, a Mirage 2000D dropped the last NATO munitions of the war, when a mixed formation of a French Air Force Mirage 2000D and a Mirage F1CR was vectored to strike an armed convoy which was trying to break through the rebels&#x27; lines at Sirte. The Mirage 2000D dropped its two laser guided GBU-12 bombs hitting and stopping Gaddafi&#x27;s convoy, resulting in his capture and death.

===Operation Serval and Operation Barkhane===
French forces became actively involved in the Northern Mali conflict (2012–present) starting from 11 January 2013 with Operation Serval.
The six Mirage 2000Ds based in N&#x27;Djamena, Chad for the long lasting French military presence in that country, alongside the two Mirage F.1CR based there, were among the first forces committed to the conflict, bombing the Islamic militants’ bases and forces in Northern Mali.
The Mirages were flying with a similar configuration to the one used over Libya nearly two years before, with two 500 lbs GBU-12 (laser) or GBU-49 (GPS and laser) guided bombs on the centerline pylon, and two external fuel tanks on the inboard wing pylons.

Starting from 17 January 2013, three of the Mirages were relocated in Bamako, Mali, preceded by the two simpler Mirage F.1CR which started operating from Bamako few days before.

Locally deployed Mirage 2000D/N French Air and Space Force aircraft keep supporting the successor Operation Barkhane.

===Opération Chammal===
Starting on 19 September 2014, the French Air Force started striking the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as part of an international effort against the terrorist organization. The strike force was initially composed of Dassault Rafale jets based in the Emirates. Later, the Rafales were sided by six Mirage 2000D, based in Jordan, starting from November 2014.
Initially the strikes were limited to targets located in Iraq. Starting from September 2015, the strikes were extended over Syria as well.

On 21 August 2016, a strike group composed of 4 Rafales and 4 Mirage 2000D launched a multiple SCALP-EG cruise missile attack against Islamic State weapon storage site, firing 12 missiles. The Rafales were armed with two cruise missiles each, while the Mirages were armed with one cruise missile each.

==Variants==
===Mirage 2000N===
The Mirage 2000N was the nuclear strike variant which was intended to carry the Aerospatiale Air-Sol Moyenne Portee (ASMP) nuclear stand-off missile. Initial flight tests of two prototypes began on 3 February 1983, and the Mirage 2000N entered operational service in 1988. A total of 75 were built. The fighter had strengthened wings for low-altitude operations, as well as low-level precision navigation/attack systems, built around the Dassault/Thales Antilope 5 radar, which was designed for the strike role and featured a terrain-avoidance capability.

The ASMP missile is 5.38 meters long with a kerosene-powered ramjet that allows it to cruise at Mach 3 to a maximum range of 100 km carrying a nuclear warhead with a yield of 300 kt.

====Upgrades====
* The existing kit was enhanced to provide an electronic intelligence (ELINT) capability, allowing the aircraft to record data on adversary emitters for post-flight intelligence analysis.
* A SAT Samir &quot;Detecteur de Depart Missile (DDM)&quot; missile-warning system was also added, being attached to the back of the Magic AAM pylons.
* Future upgrades include the addition of a Pod Reco NG (&quot;Pod de Reconnaissance Nouvelle Generation&quot;) to provide digital reconnaissance capabilities, with both day and night imagers, a digital data recorder system, and a datalink to provide real-time relay of imagery to battlefield commanders. It is being developed by Thales for service introduction in 2006.

Aircraft with the updated countermeasures system and capable of carrying both the ASMP-A missile and the Pod Reco NG will be redesignated &quot;Mirage 2000N-K3&quot;.

As it is forbidden to export them, they are being dismantled for parts with some being donated to French museums. 3 remain with the DGA for testing.

Currently, four aircraft are preserved: 305-116-CS, 336-116-BI, 337-116-BF, and 349-116-BM, all of which are in good condition with no missing parts.

===Mirage 2000D===
Delays in the Dassault Rafale fourth-generation fighter program led to a development program for an updated Mirage 2000N dedicated to conventional attack, originally designated Mirage 2000N cousin. It was to complement SEPECAT Jaguar daylight strike fighters by providing a night/bad weather attack capability.

Formal development began in 1988. The designation was changed to Mirage 2000D in 1990, with the &quot;D&quot; standing for &quot;Diversifie/Multirole&quot;. Initial flight of the Mirage 2000D prototype, a modified Mirage 2000N prototype, was on 19 February 1991. That led to first flight of a production aircraft 31 March 1993 and introduction to service in April 1995. 86 Mirage 2000Ds were built in all to last delivery in 2001.

The Mirage 2000D featured:
* An NVG-compatible cockpit, with improved &quot;hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS)&quot; controls and a partial &quot;glass cockpit&quot; arrangement. The pilot obtained a second display, and the back-seater received two more for a total of three in the rear.
* A modernized ULISS 52P navigation system with Global Positioning System (GPS) capability,
* An improved Antilope 50 terrain-following system.
* An updated &quot;ICMS 2&quot; countermeasures system, with SERVAL RWR, Chameleon jammer, and Spirale dispensers.

Full-specification Mirage 2000D-R1 aircraft could carry stores such as:
* All major dumb munitions, such as iron bombs, Belouga cluster bombs, Durandal runway breaker bombs, BAP 100 and BAP 120 clusters, Matra 68 millimeter rocket pods, and cannon pods.
* Laser-guided weapons such as the AS-30L ASM or French and US LGBs, with the munitions directed by an ATLIS II or improved optical-infrared PDLCT and high-resolution PDLCTS targeting pods, attached to a pylon under the right air intake. The navigator/WSO in the back seat handled laser targeting while the pilot in the front flew the aircraft. Carriage of the next-generation Damocles pod is now under consideration.
* The ARMAT antiradar missile, though this is rarely carried.

====Upgrades====

The Mirage 2000D remains in service, with various improvements such as the MICA IR. A general upgrade designated Mirage 2000D-R2 machine was delivered from 2001. A second upgrade program was begun in 2009, with better support for the strike role and improvement of air-to-air capabilities. This provided a multirole capability that compensated for the eventual retirement of the Mirage 2000Cs.

55 aircraft are undergoing a mid-life upgrade known as Mirage 2000D RMV (Rénovation Mi-Vie) until 2024 with the objective of keeping them in service until well after 2030. This involves updating the avionics, providing a CC422 gun pod, replacing the Magic missiles by MICA, and integrating the GBU-48 and GBU-50, at a total cost of 532.5 million euro.

A pair of Mirage 2000D RMV was deployed in early September 2021 to Djibouti to evaluate their performance in hot-weather climatic conditions. The two Mirage 2000D RMV stayed for 20 days at the Base Aérienne (Air Base) 188 Djibouti with the Escadron de Chasse et d’Expérimentation (Fighter and Experimental Squadron) 1/30 “Côte d’Argent”.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
On 1 March 2011 one Mirage 2000N crashed in Creuse region of central France near the village of Saint-Oradoux-pres-Crocq during a night flight. Both pilots were killed. 

On 24 May 2011 one Mirage 2000D crashed 100 kilometers west of Farah, Afghanistan. Both crew members successfully ejected and were recovered.

On 14 January 2012 during joint training exercise &quot;Green Shield&quot; simulating an air combat over Saudi Arabia, a French Mirage 2000D collided with a Saudi F-15S. Both aircraft were destroyed, while the three pilots ejected safely.

On 9 June 2014, in the evening, a French Air Force Mirage 2000D crashed halfway between Gao in northern Mali and the Niger capital Niamey due to a technical issue while part of Operation Serval. Both pilots ejected safely and were recovered.

In the morning of 28 September 2017, a French Air Force Mirage 2000N caught fire and crashed just after take-off from the airport of the Chadian capital of Ndjamena while part of Operation Barkhane. The plane crashed into the airport wall at 7:55, before catching fire while preparing to take off from the runway on its way to France. The two pilots ejected from the aircraft in time; one was slightly injured.

On 18 April 2018 the warhead of an inert bomb was accidentally dropped onto the roof of a car factory in Loiretaine, Nogent-sur-Vernisson, France as a pair of French Air Force Mirage 2000D fighters flew over the factory on their way to a training exercise at the Suippes training ground. Two people were injured, and the factory was evacuated until it was determined the warhead was not dangerous. 

On 9 January 2019, shortly before noon, a French Air Force Mirage 2000D crashed as it flew over the Jura mountains in the east of France. Another jet which was on the same patrol had safely returned to Nancy-Ochey air base. Both pilots were killed in the crash.

<doc id="774329" wikidata="Q2462600" url="?curid=774329" title="Patriarch Justinian of Romania">
<text>Justinian Marina (; born Ioan Marina ; February 2, 1901 – March 26, 1977) was a Romanian Orthodox prelate. He was the third patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church, serving between 1948 and 1977.

== Parish priest in the Râmnic Diocese ==

Ioan Marina was born in the village of Suieşti, in the former commune of Cermegeşti, Vâlcea County, to a family of farmers. As his mother wanted him to become a priest and he had a natural tendency toward learning, in 1915 he entered the St. Nicholas Theological Seminary in Râmnicu Vâlcea. He graduated in 1923, that year also obtaining a teacher&#x27;s diploma, after taking an examination at the Normal School in the same city.

He began his social work on September 1, 1923, as a teacher at the primary school in Olteanca, Vâlcea County. A year later, on September 1, 1924, he was transferred, also as a teacher, to the primary school in Băbeni, Vâlcea County (then a commune, now a town). Then, on October 14, 1924, he married Lucreţia Popescu, daughter of the priest Pavel Popescu, from the Braloştiţa commune, Dolj County. After this he became a priest in Băbeni, continuing to teach as well.

In 1925 he enrolled as a student at the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Theology, receiving a licentiate in theology in 1929. The next year he quit work as a schoolteacher, becoming a full-time priest. Noticing that the talents of the young priest exceeded those meant for a village priest, Vartolomeu Stănescu, Bishop of Râmnic, called Marina to him and on November 1, 1932, named him director of the St. Nicholas Theological Seminary in Râmnicu Vâlcea. That day he was also assigned as a priest at the Cathedral of Saint Nicholas, Râmnicu Vâlcea.

On September 1, 1933, he was transferred, at his request, to serve as a priest at the parish of St. George, Râmnicu Vâlcea, whose pastorate was then vacant. In 1935 he was named confessor to Râmnicu Vâlcea&#x27;s scouts, and the next year he became catechizer to the pre-military boys of the city.

Marina&#x27;s wife died on November 18, 1935, at the age of 27. Left a widower at 34, he did not remarry, raising his children, Silvia and Ovidiu, by himself.

On August 25, 1939, Fr. Marina was moved from the seminary headmastership to be the director of the diocesan printing press. In eight months, he surpassed expectations by paying off all debts to creditors of years past and re-establishing his printing press&#x27;s credibility on the market. In the spring of 1940, he handed over the printing press, now debt-free, to the newly established Metropolitanate of Craiova. He refused to go to Craiova, being aggrieved at the disestablishment of the Râmnic Diocese on November 7, 1939.

In recognition of his merits, achieved over a decade and a half as a priest, the authorities of the Râmnic Diocese awarded him all priestly honorifics (sakellarios, &quot;iconon&quot; and &quot;iconom stavrofor&quot; with the right to wear a red girdle); he was also elected to the Central Council of the General Association of Romanian Clergy. The Minister of Religion, upon the proposal of the Metropolitanate of Craiova, awarded him the &quot;Cultural merit First Class for the Church&quot;.

== Archbishop and Metropolitan of Iaşi ==

The future Patriarch Justinian owed his ascendancy within the church hierarchy to the fact that he had helped the Communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to hide in the parish house at St. George&#x27;s after the latter&#x27;s escape from the Târgu Jiu internment camp in 1944. As the prominent Communist Ion Gheorghe Maurer later recalled, &quot;After we passed Craiova by car, about 30 kilometers on, we stopped in a village where we were kept by a priest who was himself the Communists&#x27; man. The car went back to Craiova and we stayed in that village about three days until another car from Bucharest came, to take us to the capital.&quot;

There are 15 references to Justinian in the book &quot;In God&#x27;s Underground&quot; by Richard Wurmbrand, a Lutheran pastor imprisoned by the communist regime. Wurmbrand was in constant trouble with the authorities because of his outspokenness towards the regime but he credits Justinian on using his influence in the early days of his Patriarchate to ensure he was allowed to keep his license to preach. However, later he describes Justinian as having become &quot;wholly a tool of the Party&quot;.

The Metropolitan of Moldavia, Irineu Mihălcescu, who had been elected to his position on November 29, 1939, was ill and in serious need of a young, energetic and capable person to help him rebuild the diocese, gravely affected by war damage. The vicar bishop Valeriu Moglan was old and could barely handle the administration of Spiridonia, a large hospital in Iaşi. In the spring of 1945, Metropolitan Irineu asked the Ministry of Religion to set up another post of vicar bishop for the Metropolitanate of Moldavia. Once the request was granted, Metropolitan Irineu, as bishop of the place, proposed Ioan Marina for election to the post. At this point Marina was still at St. George&#x27;s, a widower for almost a decade, and the metropolitan knew him well, having had him as a student and having encountered him while he was a bishop&#x27;s assistant at Râmnic and then a metropolitan&#x27;s assistant at Craiova.

At Metropolitan Irineu&#x27;s proposal, the Holy Synod, in its July 30, 1945 session, after a canonical investigation and examination, approved Marina&#x27;s election to the second, newly founded post of vicar bishop, at the Iaşi Metropolitan Cathedral, and accorded him the rank of a titular bishop, with the Titular see of Vaslui. On August 11, 1945, at Cetăţuia Monastery in Iaşi, the priest Ioan Marina was tonsured a monk, receiving the monastic name Justinian and being ordained an archimandrite as well. He was consecrated a bishop on Sunday, August 12, 1945, in the Iaşi Metropolitan Cathedral. He was consecrated by metropolitan Irineu and bishops Antim Nica of Cetatea Albă and Valeriu Moglan of Botoşăni. 

On August 16, 1947, the aged and sick Metropolitan Irineu retired from his position and Patriarch Nicodim named Justinian as &quot;locum tenens&quot; until a permanent successor was elected. On November 19, 1947, the Ecclesiastical Electoral College met at Bucharest, with Metropolitan Nicolae Bălan of Transylvania presiding (the Patriarch was resting at Neamţ Monastery). Justinian Marina was elected Metropolitan of Moldavia. He was enthroned on December 28, 1947, at the Iaşi Metropolitan Cathedral, during a Divine Liturgy celebrated by an assembly of bishops, priests and deacons, in the presence of members of the Holy Synod, of representatives of the central and local governments (two days before the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic was proclaimed), and of numerous clergy and laymen.

In the three years that he spent at Iaşi as vicar bishop and then Metropolitan of Moldavia, Justinian put in tremendous efforts to rebuild the diocese, heavily damaged by war and scorched by drought. He reorganised the economic section of the diocesan centre, so as to ensure better administration and control over resources, while he established clear objectives for the other sections (administrative and cultural). He restored the cathedral and the metropolitan&#x27;s residence, as well as the nearby buildings, which had been marred by bullets and shells and left without windows, with cracked walls and holes in their roofs, and with the objects inside scattered and partly lost. He brought these buildings back into a well-functioning state, including the diocesan candle factory, which had almost ceased its activity during the war. At the same time, he hired young, virtuous monks to serve at the cathedral, naming the Archimandrite Teoctist Arăpaşu to the post of ecclesiarch. A severe drought in 1946–47 affected Moldavia, adding to the misery left by the war. Metropolitan Justinian permitted the first procession featuring the coffin containing the relics of Saint Parascheva, kept at Iaşi since then. The relics wended their way through the drought-deserted villages of Iaşi, Vaslui, Roman, Bacău, Putna, Neamţ, Baia and Botoşani Counties. The offerings collected on this occasion were distributed, based on Metropolitan Justinian&#x27;s decisions, to orphans, widows, invalids, school cafeterias, churches under construction, and to monasteries in order to feed the sick, and old or feeble monks.

On February 27, 1948, Patriarch Nicodim died at the age of 83 under conditions viewed as suspect by some historians. He left vacant the seat of Patriarch of All Romania. To head the church in these uncertain times, a man was sought who had a lucid and penetrating mind, an organising spirit, and who was young, sufficiently energetic to defend the Church from the attempts of the Communist regime to dismantle it.

== Elected Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church ==

The Great Ecclesiastical Electoral College, meeting in Bucharest on May 24, 1948, elected Justinian Marina Patriarch of All Romania. A statement of the Synod said that he had &quot;shown himself worthy through his devotion to Orthodoxy, through his tireless ministry work until now, through a fruitful labour on behalf of the people and the Church, through a rather well-known parental tenderness, showing through the fulfillment of all the tasks and duties which he was assigned an unflappable obedience toward the Holy Synod and the laws of the country&quot;.

On June 6, 1948, at the investiture ceremony in the hall of the Palace of the Parliament and the installation ceremony in St. Spiridon the New Church, Bucharest, Patriarch Justinian presented the agenda of his patriarchate. Among his objectives were: to prepare the clergy in the spirit of Orthodoxy and of the demands of the times; to restore Romanian monasticism; to reorganise theological education; to reunite the Church by returning the Greek-Catholics to Orthodoxy (their ancestors having left it in the Union of 1700); to strengthen brotherly relations with all Orthodox churches; to promote ecumenical relations with other Christian churches, etc.

In response to Patriarch Justinian&#x27;s call to Greek-Catholic believers, on October 1, 1948, 37 Greek-Catholic priests and archpriests assembled in a gymnasium in Cluj to sign a declaration that they would convert to the Romanian Orthodox Church, as they no longer wished to receive orders from &quot;Imperialist Rome&quot;. Two days later, their emissaries presented themselves at Bucharest under police escort before the Holy Synod, asking to be received into Orthodoxy. Prior to that, they had been laicized by their superior, Bishop Iuliu Hossu. As evident from this reference to Imperialism, this was a political move as well as a religious one, fitting in with the Cold War and denying the West a possible leverage in Romania. On October 21, 1948, a large popular assembly took place at Alba Iulia, organised by the Interior Ministry. 20,000 Greek-Catholic clergy (including those who had signed the declaration at Cluj) and laity from across Transylvania participated; they were solemnly received into the Romanian Orthodox Church.

== Achievements as Patriarch ==

Despite many difficulties, during the 29 years of Justinian&#x27;s reign, a series of events and changes took place which greatly raised the prestige of Romanian Orthodoxy in the Christian world and made him a representative figure for all of Orthodoxy. On October 19–20, 1948, the Holy Synod approved the Statute that determined the organisation and functioning of the Romanian Orthodox Church; henceforth there would be just five metropolitanates, with thirteen suffragan dioceses, to which were added two Romanian dioceses for the diaspora.

In 1950 the Holy Synod decided, for the first time, to canonize several Romanian hierarchs, monks and pious believers, and to generalize the cult of certain saints whose relics are found in Romania. Their solemn canonization took place in 1955.

Justinian built a nursing home for elderly priests and monks in Dealu and for elderly nuns and priests&#x27; wives in Viforâta. In 1948, Orthodox theological education was reorganised along lines that would last until 1989: two university-level theological institutes existed (at Bucharest and Sibiu), as well as six theological seminaries (at Bucharest, Buzău, Neamţ Monastery, Cluj, Craiova and Caransebeş).

Justinian maintained links with the other Orthodox churches and with other Christian churches. At the head of synodal delegations, he visited the following Orthodox churches: Russian (several times), Georgian (1948), Serbian (1957), Bulgarian (1953, 1966 and 1971), the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (1968), the Churches of Alexandria (1971) and Jerusalem (1975) and the Church of Greece (1963, 1971 and 1975). He began relations with Oriental Orthodox churches, through reciprocal visits. Justinian travelled to the Armenian Catholicosate at Echmiadzin (1958 and 1966), to the Ethiopian Church (1969 and 1971), to the Coptic Church (1969 and 1971) and to the Indian Orthodox Church (1969). Relations were begun and maintained with a number of national Roman Catholic Churches, some visited by Justinian at the head of synodal delegations: Austria (1969), Germany (1970) and Belgium (1972), with the Old Catholic Church and the Church of England (1966). In return, delegations from all these churches visited Patriarch Justinian and his church. In 1961 the Romanian Orthodox Church re-entered the World Council of Churches and has since participated in other ecumenical organisations, such as the Conference of European Churches.

Patriarch Justinian published 12 volumes entitled &quot;Apostolat social&quot; (&quot;Social Apostolate&quot;, Bucharest, 1948–76), containing all his pastoral letters, speeches and articles. New church periodicals appeared, or old ones continued to be published, and a series of periodicals edited by Romanian Orthodox communities abroad. The synodal Bible was re-edited, in two editions (1968 and 1975); the New Testament; all devotional books, each in multiple editions; nearly all textbooks needed for higher and seminarial theological education; and there appeared a series of theological or historic works written by bishops, professors of theology, and priests, as well as doctoral theses.

During Justinian&#x27;s reign, 302 new churches were built, 2345 others were repaired or restored. Of these, 999 were historic monuments, and of these 128 were monasteries, sketes and other monastic communities. The new churches were painted as well, while a further 271 churches had their paintings restored.

== Later years and death ==

From his enthronement to his death, as Mihai Urzică writes, &quot;faced with the adversities to which the Church was subjected, Patriarch Justinian proved himself an able diplomat and tried, as much as he could, to withstand the attacks launched against the house of the Lord. He maintained a close unity among the ranks of the clergy, he provided support for priests who were political detainees and monks released from prison and restored many churches and monasteries, resisting the sanctions, threats and even the house arrest to which, for a time, he was subjected&quot;.

Justinian protested against Decree 410 of November 19, 1959, which ordered that new monks must be at least 55 years old and nuns at least 50, and due to which some 5,000 monastics were removed from their monasteries. In response, the Patriarch was forcibly sent to Dragoslavele skete for six months.

Patriarch Justinian died on the evening of March 26, 1977, aged 76, after a painful illness and a long period of hospitalisation. He was laid to rest in the grave which he carefully prepared for himself in the interior wall of Radu Vodă Monastery, Bucharest (the monastery, dating from the 16th century, had been extensively renovated during 1969–1974, on his initiative). On the cross fixed into the wall, the Patriarch asked that the following inscription be engraved: &quot;I fought the good fight. I guarded the faith. I have reached the end of life&#x27;s road. From now on, the reward of righteousness awaits me; the Lord, the righteous Judge shall give it to me on that day&quot;.

<text>Alfred Schmitt (30 November 1907 – 2 April 1975) was a French astronomer. Schmitt worked at Algiers Observatory in the 1930s and 1940s and at the Royal Observatory in Uccle, Belgium in the 1950s. From 1955 to 1958 he was also director of the Quito Observatory in Ecuador. He extensively studied minor planets and comets and is credited with having discovered four asteroids.

== Personal life ==

Between 1940 and 1948 he married his colleague, astronomer Odette Bancilhon and thereafter she signed her work as &quot;O. Schmitt-Bancilhon&quot;.

== Signature ==

Schmitt&#x27;s publications are all signed A. Schmitt, following the practice of his profession at that time.

== Boyer ==

In 1932, Schmitt discovered an asteroid while working at the Algiers Observatory and named it in honor of his colleague, Louis Boyer – asteroid 1215 Boyer.

20 years later, Boyer named 1617 Alschmitt in Schmitt&#x27;s honor.

<text>Móricz Jókay of Ásva (18 February 1825 – 5 May 1904), known as Mór Jókai, was a Hungarian novelist, dramatist and revolutionary. Outside of Hungary, he was also known as Maurice Jókai or Maurus Jokai or Mauritius Jókai. He was a leader of the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 in Pest. His romantic novels became widely popular among the elite of Victorian England, where he was often compared to Charles Dickens by the press. One of his most famous admirers was Queen Victoria herself.

==Early life==
He was born in Komárom in the Kingdom of Hungary to József Jókai of Ásva (1781–1837), a member of the Ásva branch of the ancient Jókay noble family; his mother was noblewoman Mária Pulay (1790–1856). As a boy, he was timid and his health delicate, so he was educated at home until the age of ten, when he was sent to Pozsony (today Bratislava, Slovakia). He then attended the Calvinist college of Pápa (), where he first met Sándor Petőfi and Sándor Kozma.

When Jókai was twelve, his father died. His family wanted him to become a lawyer like his father had been, and he completed his education in Kecskemét and Pest to that end. He won his first case as an independent lawyer. 

==Career==
Jókai was bored by his work as a lawyer, and he was encouraged in his art by the praise the Hungarian Academy of Sciences gave his first play (). In 1845, he moved to Pest where Petőfi introduced him to literary circles. Within the year his first noted novel () was published as a serial by &quot;,&quot; followed by a hardcover edition in 1846. It was received with widespread critical acclaim. The following year, Jókai was appointed the editor of &quot;&quot;, the then-leading Hungarian literary magazine, and gathered a circle of young writers around himself.

At the outbreak of the revolution of 1848, Jókai was enthusiastic about its revolutionary cause. Before the revolution, he had been a moderate liberal who opposed excesses, but the revolutionary victories of April and May 1849 persuaded him support Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s deposition of the then-reigning House of Habsburg. When the revolutionary war ended in defeat, he was present at the surrender at Világos (today Şiria, Romania) in August 1849. He intended to commit suicide to avoid imprisonment, but his wife, Róza Laborfalvi helped him escape on foot through Russian lines to Pest.

For the next fourteen years Jókai was politically suspicious to the regime. He devoted himself to the rehabilitation of the Hungarian language, writing thirty novels and volumes of tales, essays, and literary criticism. His renowned works &quot;Erdély aranykora&quot; (&#x27;The Golden Age of Transylvania&#x27;), its sequel &quot;Török világ Magyarországon&quot; (&#x27;The Turks in Hungary&#x27;), &quot;Egy magyar nábob&quot; (&#x27;A Hungarian Nabob&#x27;), its sequel &quot;Kárpáthy Zoltán&quot;, &quot;Janicsárok végnapjai&quot; (&#x27;The Last Days of the Janissaries&#x27;), and &quot;Szomorú napok&quot; (&#x27;Sad Days&#x27;) were written during this time.

After the re-establishment of the Hungarian constitution by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Jókai took an active part in politics. He was a long-time supporter of Kálmán Tisza&#x27;s administration, sitting for over twenty years in parliament and founding the government paper &quot;&quot; in 1863. In 1897, King Francis Joseph appointed him a member of the Upper House. In 1899, he caused a country-wide scandal by marrying Bella Nagy, a twenty-year-old actress.

Jókai died in Budapest on 5 May 1904. He was buried with his first wife (who had died in 1886) in the Fiume Road Graveyard.

==Writings==
Jókai was an extremely prolific writer, especially after 1870. He devoted most of his time to literature. Among the finest of his later works are &quot;Az arany ember&quot; (&#x27;A Man of Gold&#x27;, translated into English under the title &quot;The Man with the Golden Touch&quot;), the most popular &quot;A kőszívű ember fiai&quot; (&quot;The Heartless Man&#x27;s Sons&quot;), the heroic chronicle of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and &quot;A tengerszemű hölgy&quot; (&quot;Eyes like the Sea&quot;), the latter of which won the Hungarian Academy&#x27;s prize in 1890.

His &quot;Jövő század regénye&quot; (&quot;Novel of the Next Century,&quot; 1872) is an important early work of science fiction, though the term did not yet exist at the time. In spite of its romantic elements, this monumental two-volume novel includes some acute observations and foresights, such as the prediction of a revolution in Russia and the establishment of a totalitarian state there, or the arrival of aviation. Because it could be read as a satirical allegory on Leninism and Stalinism, the book was tacitly banned in Hungary in the decades of Socialism (only a &#x27;Critical Edition&#x27; was published in 1981.)

His writings became a major influence in the works of Gyula Krudy.

<doc id="774340" wikidata="Q11345481" url="?curid=774340" title="Limbic lobe">
<text>The limbic lobe is an arc-shaped cortical region of the limbic system, on the medial surface of each cerebral hemisphere of the mammalian brain, consisting of parts of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. The term is ambiguous, with some authors including the paraterminal gyrus, the subcallosal area, the cingulate gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus and the subiculum;

==History==
Broca named the limbic lobe in 1878, identifying it with the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri, and associating it with the sense of smell - Treviranus having earlier noted that, between species, the size of the parahippocampal gyrus varies with the size of the olfactory nerve. In 1937, Papez theorized that a neural circuit (the Papez circuit) including the hippocampal formation and the cingulate gyrus constitutes the neural substrate of emotional behavior, and Klüver and Bucy reported that, in monkeys, resection involving the hippocampal formation and the amygdaloid complex has a profound effect on emotional responses. As a consequence of these publications, the idea that the entire limbic lobe is dedicated to olfaction receded, and a direct connection between emotion and the limbic lobe was established.

<text>Franz Josef Jonas (4 October 1899 – 24 April 1974) was an Austrian politician who served as the president of Austria between 1965 and 1974 as a member of the Socialist Party of Austria. He previously served as mayor of Vienna from 1951 to 1965 while simultaneously serving in the Austrian Parliament. Jonas first entered politics as a young adult while he was working as a typesetter, joining the Socialist Youth Movement and the Printers&#x27; Union. He served on the town council of Floridsdorf beginning in 1945 and was then placed in command of Vienna&#x27;s food supply and housing in 1948 and 1949, respectively. Jonas took interest in international affairs, making several international trips as mayor and as president. As president, he oversaw the creation of a minority government under Bruno Kreisky, the leader of the Socialist Party. Jonas died in office after he was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

== Early life and career ==
Franz Jonas was born in Vienna on 4 October 1899. He was born to a working class family and had seven siblings. After graduating school, he attended the printers&#x27; school of graphic arts. He later attended the Wiener Arbeiterbildungszentrum () where his instructors included fellow future presidents Karl Renner, Adolf Schärf, and Theodor Körner. He did not receive formal schooling at a traditional university. Jonas was conscripted during World War I to fight in the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces in 1917. He served in the Deutschmeister regiment, where he served on the Eastern Front and the Italian front. He got a job as a typesetter at the end of the war in 1919 and continued in the profession until 1932.

Jonas met Margarete &quot;Grete&quot; Towarek in 1921 at the home of a worker with the socialists, and they married on 22 December 1922. They honeymooned in the Vienna Woods and then moved into a Krankenhaushäusern in Floridsdorf. They did not have any children, as they were first unable to support any financially and then were unable to have any because of health complications. Jonas was interested in designing stamps, and he played sports. He was also an Esperantist, joining the Esperanto workers movement and becoming an instructor of the language.

Jonas became active in socialist politics, joining the Socialist Youth Movement, becoming an official in the Printers&#x27; Union, and serving as socialist organiser for his district in the 1930s. He was arrested along with numerous other socialists in 1935 and charged with treason, but he was acquitted and released in 1936. The typesetter shop where he had worked closed at this time, leaving him unemployed. Jonas became an engine factory clerk during World War II. He was appointed to the town council of Floridsdorf after the Allied powers took control of Austria in 1945, where he became chairman in 1946. Jonas was put in command of Vienna&#x27;s food supply in 1948, and he became the Viennese Commissioner for Housing in 1949. He became leader of Vienna&#x27;s branch of the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ) in 1950.

== Mayor of Vienna ==
Jonas became mayor of Vienna in June 1951 as the previous office holder, his former instructor Körner, became president of Austria. Jonas served as the Viennese mayor for 14 years. Because of his interest in foreign affairs, Jonas made several international trips while he was mayor. He emphasised the city&#x27;s international significance, seeking to revitalise it as a hub for European culture and diplomacy. Jonas was elected to parliament the same year his mayoralty began. He served in the Federal Council from 1951 to 1953 and then moved to the National Council. He held this position until he was elected president in 1965. As mayor, Jonas also served the chairman of the Austrian union of towns and an executive within the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. He was generally popular as mayor.

== President of Austria ==
President Adolf Schärf of the Socialist Party of Austria (SPÖ) died in office, prompting a presidential election in 1965. Jonas won the election and was elected president on 23 May 1965. He was elected by the SPÖ with a popular vote of 2,324,436, defeating Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP) candidate Alfons Gorbach who received 2,260,888 votes. Jonas&#x27;s lack of a formal education was a major issue during the election. He took office on 21 June 1951.

In 1966, Jonas was awarded the Grand Cross of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav with Collar, and in 1969 the ÖOC Pierre de Coubertin Medal.

Jonas used his power to reject government appointments in the 1960s to oppose the ÖVP government&#x27;s choices for president of the administrative court and for ambassador to West Germany. Jonas was popular among the public, to the point that SPÖ party leader Bruno Kreisky tried to make their names synonymous during the 1970 legislative election. No party won a majority of seats, so Jonas was responsible for approving a negotiated government. The SPÖ held a plurality and Kreisky asked Jonas to appoint a minority government with the implicit endorsement of the Freedom Party of Austria. Rather than force coalition negotiations, Jonas agreed and appointed Kreisky as chancellor of Austria. Jonas was reelected president on 25 April 1971. He received 2,488,372 votes, defeating ÖVP candidate Kurt Waldheim who received 2,225,368 votes. Jonas&#x27;s second term began on 9 June 1971.

Continuing his interest in international affairs, Jonas visited Iran in 1965, the United Kingdom in 1966, Thailand and Canada in 1967, Yugoslavia in 1968, Switzerland and Romania in 1969, Belgium, Bulgaria, and Hungary in 1970, Finland in 1972, and West Germany in 1973. His visit to the United Kingdom received widespread attention as it was the first time a leader of a former Axis nation visited an Allied nation. He also hosted several leaders in Vienna, including Norwegian king Olav V, Soviet president Nikolai Podgorny, Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, British queen Elizabeth II, and Romanian president Nicolae Ceaușescu. Jonas removed himself from his duties as president on 27 March 1974 following a diagnosis of stomach cancer. He died in a Vienna University clinic on 24 April 1974.

<text>Harjavalta () is a town and municipality in Finland. It&#x27;s located in the Satakunta region, southeast of Pori. The town has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Harjavalta is a centre for copper and nickel smelting industries. Today&#x27;s most used metal recovery method, the flash smelting method, was developed at Harjavalta and implemented in 1949. Originally part of Outokumpu, a Finnish company, the local copper business is now owned by Boliden and the nickel business by Norilsk Nickel.

Hiittenharju is a ridge in Harjavalta, known for its archaeology and cultural history. The banks of the ancient Litorina Sea lies on the fringes of the Hiittenharju ridge. In the Hiittenharju area Bronze Age graves, called barrows, have been discovered, and there is also a historical route called Huovintie running through Hiittenharju. The river Kokemäenjoki river runs through the town.

The neighboring municipalities are Eura, Kokemäki, Nakkila and Ulvila. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==
Earliest signs of habitation on the area have been dated to 1200 BC. Various different writings of the name in documents of the 15th century at the Turku Cathedral are &quot;Harianwalta&quot;, &quot;Hariawalta&quot;, &quot;Hariaualdastha&quot;, &quot;Harianwaltha&quot; and &quot;Harianwaltaby&quot;. The name is supposed to originate from the speculative Proto Germanic name &quot;&quot;, composed of the speculative words &quot;*harjaz&quot; (&quot;army&quot;) and &quot;*waldaz&quot; (&quot;authority&quot;). It is believed that either a person named Harjawaldaz or a warrior band settled or lived in the area. The earliest known written occurrence of the name is from Tacitus on the first century, &quot;Chariovalda&quot;. Different adoptions of the same name are Harald, Hérault and Harold, but Harjavalta is closest to the reconstructed original.

In 1670, the villages of Harjavalta formed their own chapel parish, but the official status of an independent congregation began to be sought about 200 years later. Harjavalta&#x27;s application for its own pastor was granted in 1868, and the decision was implemented in 1878. The new independent parish had about 1,600 members. The great famine years in the 1860s doubled mortality in Finland, but on the scale of Finland as a whole, Harjavalta did little to avoid this ordeal. The act of 1865 on the municipal government led to the formation of the municipal council and the municipal government also in Harjavalta in 1869. This is considered to be the year of birth of the municipality of Harjavalta. The first store in Harjavalta was founded in a church village in 1874. A second store soon opened in the village of Merstola. The most important sales products were salt, coffee and sugar, but the selections also included fabrics, wheat flour, licorice and tobacco. The first school building was acquired in 1885, when the municipality bought the Kreetala farm, the main building of which became Harjavalta&#x27;s first folk school.

==Transport==
Harjavalta is served by OnniBus.com route Helsinki—Pori.

<text>Émile Jonassaint (; May 20, 1913 – October 24, 1995) was a Haitian Supreme Court Justice and politician who served as President of the Constituent Assembly during the 1987 Constitution and President of Haiti for five months.

Jonassaint served as Head of the Provisional Government of Haiti for five months (May 12 and October 12) in 1994 after the military regime had forced Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected president, out of the country in 1991. It is alleged by President Aristide sympathizers that, during his presidency, the military conducted some of the harshest human rights abuses in the history of Haiti.

Throughout 1994 the U.S. government put pressure on the repressive Haitian military leaders to resign and allow the elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return to the country. Under the Haitian Constitution of 1987. If, for whatever reason, the president cannot discharge of his duties, his authority will be vested unto the Cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister. 

The Prime Minister at the time, Rene Preval, had left the country following a request by the Parliament (duly elected as well) that he come to their chambers to answer allegations of fraud and abuses of power, among other things. Parliamentary leaders had intended to hold a vote of no confidence in respect of the Prime Minister. Instead of appearing in front of the Parliament, the Prime Minister defied the third branch and its power and his good friend, President Aristide, usurping the powers not delegated to the executive branch or him under the Constitution. Preval went to the Parliamentary chambers and threatened the parliamentary leaders. Some were beaten by his supporters, had their houses ransacked, and had their lives threatened. 

President Aristide became a destabilizing force. Some military leaders arrested the President and deported him to Venezuela. As a result, Article 148 of the Constitution could not be enforced, and under Article 149, a Provisional government was formed with a senior member of the Cour de Cassation. In May, the United Nations Security Council called for all necessary means to be taken for the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power -- (Resolution 917). Approximately 100 UN monitors went to the Dominican Republic-Haiti border in mid-August to stop oil smuggling, which was sustaining the Haitian military leaders.

In response, Émile Jonassaint declared a state of siege and accused the world of having &quot;declared war on poor Haiti, which has harmed nobody.&quot; Throughout August, the army and its paramilitary ally, the &#x27;Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti,&#x27; continued to presumably murder some Aristide supporters while organizing parades of &quot;volunteers&quot; to fight an invasion.

On September 18, 1994 Dr. Robert S. Westcott received an invitation from President Jonassaint for a mission of fact including former president Jimmy Carter, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin Powell, Sen. Sam Nunn, and 3 others to negotiate the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with Emile Jonassaint, Head of the Provisional Government in Haiti. Emile Jonassaint signed what is known as the Port-au-Prince Accord and step down as Head of the Provisional Government of Haiti upon the return of the elected president. On October 24, 1995, Jonassaint died at the age of 82.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. The municipality is also known as &quot;Gustav Adolfs&quot; in Swedish. Hartola is home to the Itä-Hämeen Museo, the regional museum for seven municipalities.

Since 1987, the town has billed itself as a sovereign royal parish based upon a 1784 proclamation by King Gustav III of Sweden creating a new parish on the eastern border of his kingdom in honor of his son, Gustav Adolf.

At every first Saturday in September, there is a fair at Hartola. The event is biggest in Finland at its genre.

The municipality is also known as the writer Maila Talvio&#x27;s place of birth.

==History==
Hartola may have been mentioned as early as 1398 (&quot;ut ecclesia parrochialis Hartola Aboensis dioceses&quot;), however this may have also referred to Hattula. It was originally a part of the parish of Sysmä. At least between 1540 and 1729, it was called &quot;Koskipää&quot;, after which the name &quot;Hartola&quot; appears again.

Hartola became an independent parish in 1784. It was also granted the Swedish name &quot;Gustav Adolfs&quot;. In Finnish, the parish was also known as &quot;Kustavus, Kustavuksenpitäjä&quot; and &quot;Kustaanpitäjä&quot;, but the name &quot;Hartola&quot; was still in use. By the late 1800s, &quot;Hartola&quot; had become the sole name for the parish.

Joutsa was a part of Hartola until 1860, while Leivonmäki was a part of Hartola until 1880.

<doc id="774355" wikidata="Q1347953" url="?curid=774355" title="Leabua Jonathan">
<text>Joseph Leabua Jonathan (30 October 1914 – 5 April 1987) was the first prime minister of Lesotho. He succeeded Chief Sekhonyana Nehemia Maseribane following a by-election and held that post from 1965 to 1986.

==Early life and career==
Born in Leribe, Jonathan was a minor chief, like many others a great-grandson of the polygamous King Moshoeshoe I.

Jonathan worked as a mine induna at Brakpan but because he was a chief he went back to Rakolo&#x27;s and got involved in local government in Basutoland from 1937 and was a member of delegations to London that sought self-government in Basutoland.

==Politics and premiership==
Jonathan converted to Catholicism and in 1959 founded the Canadian Catholic missionary-backed Basutoland National Party (BNP), renamed Basotho National Party at independence. In the 1960 election, barely a year after its formation, Leabua&#x27;s party came fourth but in the election where women were disfranchised. In the pre-independence elections of April 1965, the BNP won 31 parliamentary seats out of a total of 60 and thus became a legitimate government that eventually took Basotho to independence in October 1966, despite protests from opposition BCP and MFP who now wanted independence postponed. Chief Leabua did lose his seat and had to stand for election in a safe seat later. He took office as Prime Minister on 7 July 1965.

Soon after Basutoland gained independence in 1966 as Lesotho, executive power was transferred from the British High Commissioner to the Prime Minister. Jonathan&#x27;s government took a pacifist stand in South Africa, and this was supported by independent Southern African states such as Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, and Tanzania among others as they understood the unique situation Lesotho was in as it is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and the majority of its people work in the mines there; also because Jonathan at the time thought that he could talk sense with South African prime ministers Henrik Verwoerd and Balthazar Johannes Vorster, who were contemporary with him. Jonathan was hostile to the Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa who supported the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and Marematlou Freedom Party (MFP, but friendly to the African National Congress (ANC). He forged closer links with the ANC after the PAC-backed Lesotho Liberation Army, the exiled BCP military wing, prepared to target Lesotho after 1973.

==State of emergency==
Early results of the first post-independence elections in January 1970 indicated that the Basotho National Party (BNP) might lose control. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Chief Leabua Jonathan, the ruling BNP refused to cede power to the rival Basotholand Congress Party (BCP), although the BCP was widely believed to have won the elections. Citing election irregularities, Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan nullified the elections, declared a national state of emergency, suspended the constitution, and dissolved the Parliament. In 1973, an appointed Interim National Assembly was established. With an overwhelming progovernment majority, it was largely the instrument of the BNP, led by Prime Minister Jonathan. In addition to the Jonathan regime&#x27;s alienation of Basotho powerbrokers and the local population, South Africa had virtually closed the country&#x27;s land borders because of Lesotho support of cross-border operations of the African National Congress (ANC). Moreover, South Africa publicly threatened to pursue more direct action against Lesotho if the Jonathan government did not root out the ANC presence in the country. This internal and external opposition to the government combined to produce violence and internal disorder in Lesotho that eventually led to a military takeover in 1986.

Under a January 1986 Military Council decree, state executive and legislative powers were transferred to the King who was to act on the advice of the Military Council, a self-appointed group of leaders of the Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF). A military government chaired by Justin Lekhanya ruled Lesotho in coordination with King Moshoeshoe II and a civilian cabinet appointed by the King.

In February 1990, King Moshoeshoe II was stripped of his executive and legislative powers and exiled by Lekhanya, and the Council of Ministers was purged. Lekhanya accused those involved of undermining discipline within the armed forces, subverting existing authority, and causing an impasse on foreign policy that had been damaging to Lesotho&#x27;s image abroad. Lekhanya announced the establishment of the National Constituent Assembly to formulate a new constitution for Lesotho with the aim of returning the country to democratic, civilian rule by June 1992. Before this transition, however, Lekhanya was ousted in 1991 by a mutiny of junior army officers that left Phisoane Ramaema as Chairman of the Military Council.

==Racial policy and opposition to apartheid==
Despite Lesotho&#x27;s economic dependence on South Africa and the government&#x27;s official policy during the 1970s of dialogue with its neighbour, Jonathan began criticizing the South African government&#x27;s policy of apartheid supporting for the prohibited African National Congress (ANC) when international advisers suggested Pretoria&#x27;s days were numbered.

During the late 1970s, Jonathan, despite his regime&#x27;s protests to Libya, nevertheless accused the South African government of supporting the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA). Mokhehle did go to Pretoria but only in late 1981. The main LLA force was wiped out in 1979 but later recruits were assisted by a Transkei-based American mercenary with Rhodesian army service, Major Bob MacKenzie, son-in-law of the former CIA deputy-director, Ray Steiner Cline, a former member of the 1969 Nixon administration. The South African government denied these claims but later admitted Mokhehle was part of the notorious Vlakplaas operation.

==Awards and recognition==
*Dag Hammarskjöld award in 1983
*Honorary PhD in education from the NUL in 1984
*Companion of O.R. Tambo Award (gold) in 2007 (posthumously)

==Downfall and death==
On 20 January 1986, a military coup led by Major General Justin Metsing Lekhanya, under pressure both from Pretoria and the Leballo faction of the Pan Africanist Congress, deposed the Jonathan government. Leabua Jonathan was placed under house arrest in August 1986 and died of a heart attack on 5 April 1987 at the age of 73.

<text>Hattula () is a municipality of Finland. It is part of the Tavastia Proper region and until 2010 it was located in the province of Southern Finland. Hattula is almost completely surrounded by Hämeenlinna, only in the north it shares the border with Valkeakoski and Pälkäne on the Pirkanmaa region side.

The municipality has a population of 
() and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is
. Its seat is in Parola.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

A central element of the landscape in Hattula is lake Vanajavesi by which most of the oldest settlements in the area are concentrated. A notable monument is the Holy Cross Church in Hattula.

The main attractions of Hattula are based on the long history of the municipality as a church pilgrimage site and the location of the Parolannummi garrison. The Armoured Brigade operates in the Parola garrison. Also close to the garrison are the Armour Museum, presenting the history of Finnish armoured and anti-tank troops, and the Paragon Lion sculpture by Andreas Fornander. The Lion of Parola is a statue of a lion holding a ball in his paw, commemorating the visit of Emperor Alexander II of Russia to Parolannummi on July 29, 1863. The same theme is repeated in the flag of the Finnish army&#x27;s Armour School. A monument of more than five meters is located on the southern edge of the garrison training ground.

There are three Evangelical Lutheran churches in the municipality: the medieval Church of the Holy Cross, the new Hattula church built in the 1850s and the Tyrväntö church built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Suotaala. In addition to these, the Pentecostal Church&#x27;s Home Church also operates in the center of the municipality.

The long manor culture in Hattula is represented by the manors of Ahlbacka, Ellilä, Metsänkylä, Lepaa, Lahdentaka, Suontaka and Vesunti. In addition to the Iron Age Tenhola Castle Mountain, earlier settlement in the area is also evidenced by numerous archaeological finds. The historic Hämeen Härkätie (connecting road 2855) also passes the track in the Hattula area in the villages of Kivijoki and Kouvala.

Astronomer Anders Planman was born in Hattula. He was one of the first persons to make systematical astronomical observations in Finland.

<text>Brereton Chandler Jones (June 27, 1939 – September 18, 2023) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1991 to 1995, he was the state&#x27;s 58th governor, and had served from 1987 to 1991 as the 50th lieutenant governor of Kentucky. After his governorship, he chaired the Kentucky Equine Education Project (KEEP), a lobbying organization for the Kentucky horse industry.

Born in Ohio and raised in West Virginia, Jones became the youngest-ever member of the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1964. Two years later, he was chosen as the Republican floor leader in the House. In 1968, he decided to leave politics and focus on his real estate business. He married Elizabeth &quot;Libby&quot; Lloyd in 1970 and in 1972 the family moved to historic Airdrie Farm, Libby&#x27;s family estate in Woodford County, Kentucky. There, Jones founded Airdrie Stud, now an internationally recognized Thoroughbred farm. Although he remained mostly out of politics, Jones changed his party affiliation to Democratic in 1975, and was appointed to various boards and commissions by governors John Y. Brown Jr. and Martha Layne Collins.

In 1987, Jones announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor, admitting that he considered the office a stepping stone to some day becoming governor. He was elected, but experienced a poor relationship with Governor Wallace Wilkinson throughout their four-year terms. Jones was elected governor in 1991, turning back a challenge from Governor Wilkinson&#x27;s wife Martha in the Democratic primary. Although Jones maintained a strained relationship with the Kentucky General Assembly following comments he made in the wake of the federal Operation Boptrot investigation, he was still able to pass much of his agenda, including an amendment that would allow state officials to succeed themselves in office once. However, he achieved only a partial victory on his top priority – healthcare reform. While the legislature acceded to many of Jones&#x27;s proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians.

Following his term in office, Jones founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project.

==Early life==
Although his family lived in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, Brereton Jones was born on June 27, 1939, in Gallipolis, Ohio, the site of the nearest hospital to the family&#x27;s home. One of six children born to E. Bartow Jones II, who served two terms in the West Virginia Senate, and Nedra Wilhelm Jones, he was raised on a dairy farm in Point Pleasant.

Jones was a star football player in the public schools of Point Pleasant (Point Pleasant High School, Class of 1957). After graduating from high school as valedictorian, he attended the University of Virginia on a football scholarship, playing both offensive and defensive end. He earned a Bachelor of Commerce in 1961. For one semester, he studied at the University of Virginia School of Law, but he returned home to West Virginia and established a real estate and construction business.

In 1964, Jones&#x27; political career began with his election as a Republican to the West Virginia House of Delegates. He was the youngest person ever elected to that body. In 1966, he was chosen as the Republican floor leader in the House. In 1968, Jones announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat, despite facing no opposition. Among the factors influencing his decision was his perception of corruption in state politics.

After his service in the West Virginia House, Jones began to concentrate on his real estate business and established a small horse farm just outside Huntington. His interest in the horse business led him to make several trips to Keeneland race track in central Kentucky; it was on one of these trips that he met his future wife, Elizabeth &quot;Libby&quot; Lloyd, daughter of Arthur Lloyd, the former Adjutant General of Kentucky. Jones and Lloyd married in 1970; they had two children – Lucy and Bret. In 1972, the Joneses moved to Airdrie Farm, Libby&#x27;s childhood home in Woodford County, Kentucky. Jones leased a portion of the farm from his father-in-law and founded Airdrie Stud, a thoroughbred horse farm that has since been internationally recognized for its horses. Airdrie contains the original site of Woodburn Stud, a top thoroughbred farm in the 1800s. The property had not been used for breeding for 70 years prior to Jones&#x27; creation of Airdrie Stud. Jones went on to chair the Kentucky Thoroughbred Commission and serve as treasurer of the Breeders&#x27; Cup.

==Political career in Kentucky==
In 1975, Jones registered as a Democrat, citing his disenchantment with the Nixon administration and his desire to participate in Kentucky primary elections. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in Kentucky by a 2-to-1 margin. Governor John Y. Brown Jr. named him to the board of directors for the University of Kentucky and the Chandler Medical Center. In the mid-1980s, Jones created the Kentucky Health Care Access Foundation to provide free health care to individuals who fell below the poverty line but did not qualify for Medicaid. Governor Martha Layne Collins chose Jones to chair her Medicaid Program Review Team and serve on her Council on Education Reform.

===Lieutenant governor===
In late 1985, Jones announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor in the 1987 election, conceding that he sought the office because he would like to serve as governor in the future. He convincingly won in the Democratic primary against Paul E. Patton, who later became governor, and David L. Armstrong, the sitting Attorney General and later Mayor of Louisville. Wallace G. Wilkinson, winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary, praised Jones and said that, if elected, he would make Jones the head of a blue-ribbon economic development council. Wilkinson and Jones went on to win the general election; Jones defeated Republican nominee Lawrence R. Webster by a convincing vote of 517,811 to 186,321.

Soon after the election results were announced, Jones was quoted in a newspaper as saying that he had talked with Wilkinson about opening channels with the media, whom Wilkinson often refused to speak with. Jones also said that he did not agree with all of Wilkinson&#x27;s political positions and would not be his &quot;yes man&quot;. These comments angered Wilkinson, who backtracked on his promise to give Jones an active role in the administration. Relations between Jones and Wilkinson further deteriorated as both men tried to recoup the money spent during their campaigns.
During the 1988 legislative session, Governor Wilkinson proposed an amendment to the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include a runoff provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson&#x27;s proposed education program also failed in the session, and Jones suggested that the governor should build a consensus among legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special legislative session, which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 session, Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the session.

As lieutenant governor, Jones advocated for the preservation of family farms and for school reform. He won praise for his efforts to include a &quot;Made in Kentucky&quot; label on produce grown in the state. Further, he claimed the state could save $500,000 a year by merging the offices of lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and state treasurer. Jones maintained that the arrangement would give the lieutenant governor something specific to do between legislative sessions and would provide a broader record upon which voters could judge the officeholder should they seek higher office. Jones&#x27; proposal, which would have required a constitutional amendment, was never adopted. Jones also claimed to have saved his office $200,000 by choosing not to live in the lieutenant governor&#x27;s mansion, by reducing the number of Kentucky State Police troopers used for security at the mansion, and by giving up seven cars assigned to the officetwo for him and wife Libby, and five used by the state troopers.

===Governor===
In 1991, Jones was the front-runner for the governorship for the entire gubernatorial campaign. The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson had become so strong that Wilkinson&#x27;s wife Martha was among Jones&#x27; challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18 days before the primary. Advocating campaign finance reform, Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).

In the general election, Jones faced Republican Larry Hopkins, a seven-term congressman representing Kentucky&#x27;s 6th congressional district. Hopkins was considered the Republicans&#x27; best hope of capturing the governorship since Louie B. Nunn in 1967. Instead, Hopkins&#x27; negative campaign ads, mistakes about his record, and involvement in a House scandal involving bounced checks all hurt his chances. Jones won the election by a vote of 540,468 to 294,542, the largest margin of victory in a Kentucky gubernatorial race.

A supporter of &quot;good government&quot;, Jones&#x27; first policy action as governor was to issue an executive order restricting the post-government employment of his appointees. He also secured passage of one of the nation&#x27;s toughest ethics laws, limiting the activities of lobbyists and instituting campaign finance reform to diminish the advantage of wealthy candidates for office. The so-called &quot;trustees bill&quot;, passed in 1992, provided for an independent review of all appointees to university boards of trustees. Jones later removed former governor Wilkinson from the board of the University of Kentucky using the bill&#x27;s provisions. Despite these reforms, Jones drew criticism from ethics watchdogs because no law required him to disclose the identities of his business partners and associates with Airdrie Stud and because the farm benefited from a 1992 law that set up off-track betting parlors and allowed some of their proceeds to go to successful breeders.

The state faced a $400 million revenue shortfall when Jones took office. Shortly after his election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to streamline state government. Among the enacted recommendations were refinancing state bonds at lower interest rates, cutting the state workforce by 2,000 employees (mostly through attrition), and spurring local economic growth through tax incentives. By the end of Jones&#x27; term, the state enjoyed a $300 million budget surplus.

During the first year of his administration, Jones and five others were traveling in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox on August 7, 1992, when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash near Graefenburg in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.

Although fellow Democrats controlled two-thirds of the Kentucky General Assembly, Jones never developed a good working relationship with the legislature. This was due in part to remarks Jones made in the wake of the Operation Boptrot investigation that led to the conviction of 15 sitting or former state legislators. Jones called the investigation &quot;a cleansing process&quot;; legislators reacted negatively, claiming Jones was trying to take &quot;the high ground&quot; above them. Following Jones&#x27; remarks, state senate president John &quot;Eck&quot; Rose became Jones&#x27; bitter political foe. Nevertheless, Jones was able to enact many of his legislative priorities during his term.

Jones&#x27; top priority as governor was the passage of health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure to come out of this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.

Both chambers worked to reconcile differences between their respective versions of the bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, the last day of the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetoes, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.

Jones also advocated for an amendment to the state constitution that had major implications for the governor&#x27;s office. Under the terms of the amendment, the lieutenant governor no longer became acting governor when the sitting governor left the state. It also allowed candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a ticket instead of being elected on separate ballots. The centerpiece of the amendment, however, was the removal of the restriction on governors from succeeding themselves in office. The state constitution had previously barred the incumbent from seeking a second consecutive term; under the new amendment, the sitting governor would be allowed to succeed himself once. Succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during the administrations of John Y. Brown Jr. and Wallace Wilkinson, but Jones was able to see it passed because, unlike Brown and Wilkinson, he was willing to exempt the present incumbents, including himself, from the succession provision. Separate legislation passed during Jones&#x27; term required a runoff election if no gubernatorial candidate won a majority in his or her party primary. (Each of Jones&#x27; three immediate predecessors would have faced a runoff had this law been in effect during their primaries.)

Among Jones&#x27; other accomplishments were the passage of a mandatory seat belt law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the phasing out of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state&#x27;s largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state&#x27;s sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4 percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.

==Later life==
At the end of his term as governor, Jones retired to Airdrie Stud. He started Commonwealth Broadcasting and joined with partners to purchase several radio and television stations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He remained a public advocate of campaign finance reform and health care reform and was a supporter of posting the Ten Commandments in public schools.

In 2004, he founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project (KEEP), an organization dedicated to educating the public about Kentucky&#x27;s horse industry and lobbying the General Assembly for more horse-friendly legislation. He served as chair of KEEP from 2004 to 2011.

In October 2016, Jones was the recipient of the inaugural Industry Vision Award for &quot;significant contributions to Kentucky&#x27;s horse industry.&quot;

Jones died on September 18, 2023, from a long-illness at his Airdrie Stud Farm in Midway, Kentucky, at age 84. His casket was laid in state at the Kentucky State Capitol on September 25. His funeral was held two days later at Forks of Elkhorn Baptist Church in Midway and was followed by a private burial.

<doc id="774360" wikidata="Q1682601" url="?curid=774360" title="Jane Harrison (playwright)">
<text>Jane Harrison is an Aboriginal Australian playwright, novelist, literary festival director, and researcher. Her best-known work is the play &quot;Stolen&quot;, which received critical claim and has toured nationally and internationally since 1998. 
==Early life and education ==
Harrison is a descendant of the Muruwari people of New South Wales, from the area around Bourke and Brewarrina.

She grew up in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria with her mother and sister, and began her career as an advertising copywriter.

==Plays==
===&quot;Stolen&quot;===

&quot;Stolen&quot; premièred in 1998 at Playbox (now Malthouse Theatre) Melbourne directed by Wesley Enoch followed by seven annual seasons in Melbourne, plus tours to Sydney, Adelaide, regional Victoria, Tasmania, the United Kingdom (twice), Hong Kong and Tokyo, with readings in Canada, New York City and Los Angeles. In Sydney, it was performed at the Sydney Theatre Company, directed by Wayne Blair. &quot;Stolen&quot; is a play about the lives of five First Nations people from the stolen generations. For &quot;Stolen&quot; Harrison was awarded the Australian Writers&#x27; Guild AWGIE Nomination, was co-winner of the Kate Challis RAKA Award, and received an Honourable Mention in the CACS National Awards Individual Category for &quot;An Outstanding Contribution to Australian Culture&quot;. Stolen has been studied on the Victorian Certificate of Education and New South Wales Higher School Certificate English and drama syllabi for some years - it is the vehicle through which a generation of young people have learned about the stolen generations of First Nations children. Australian Book Review writes &quot;Stolen is a contemporary classic&quot;.

Sydney Theatre Company staged a new production of &quot;Stolen&quot; in its 2024 season, directed by Ian Michael.

===&quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot;===
&quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; premièred in 2005, and toured Melbourne, Sydney, regional Australia, and Japan in 2007, and has had numerous subsequent productions. Harrison was awarded for &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; the Drover Award (Tour of the Year) and a Helpmann Awards nomination for Best Regional Touring Production. It has been studied on the New South Wales Higher School Certificate and is currently on the Victorian Certificate of Education English syllabus. &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; tells the simple, yet convoluted story of three generations of First Nations women; young Dolly, her mother the happy-go-lucky Gladys, and the wise and stern Nan Dear, living in their shanty perched on the flats of the Goulburn River in 1950s regional Victoria. The play was initially directed by Wesley Enoch.

===&quot;On a Park Bench&quot;===
&quot;On a Park Bench&quot; was created through workshops at Playbox and the Banff playRites Colony in 2002. The play was a finalist in the Lake Macquarie Drama Prize.

===&quot;Blakvelvet&quot;===
&quot;Blakvelvet&quot; won the 2006 Theatrelab Indigenous Award.

===&quot;The Visitors&quot;===
&quot;The Visitors&quot; was initially workshopped at the Yellamundie Festival in 2013, before a development at the Melbourne Theatre Company Cybec Electric series / Melbourne Indigenous Festival in 2014, directed by Leah Purcell.&quot;The Visitors&quot; re-imagines the arrival of the First Fleet on Gadigal country from the perspective of seven elders meeting on the shores of the harbour.

&quot;The Visitors&quot; premiered as a full production in January 2020 as part of the Sydney Festival. It was awarded the prize for Best New Australian Work, 2022 Sydney Theatre Awards, and was shortlisted for the Nick Enright Prize for Playwriting at the 2021 New South Wales Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards.

Sydney Theatre Company and Moogahlin Performing Arts produced a second production of &quot;The Visitors&quot; at the Sydney Opera House in September / October 2023, directed by Wesley Enoch. This production won the 2023 Sydney Theatre Awards for Best Mainstage Production, and Best Ensemble, and went on to tour regional Australia in 2024.

Victorian Opera commissioned Harrison to collaborate with composer Christopher Sainsbury to develop an operatic version of &quot;The Visitors&quot;, staged at Arts Centre Melbourne in October 2023.

The opera was listed on the Victorian Certificate of Education 2023 curriculum.

==Novels and short stories==

===&quot;The Visitors&quot;===
The narrative arc presented in Harrison&#x27;s play &quot;The Visitors&quot; is reconceptualized as a literary novel, also called &quot;The Visitors&quot;, published by HarperCollins in 2023. The novel was named Debut Fiction book of the year in the 2024 Indie Book Awards.

===&quot;Becoming Kirrali Lewis&quot;===
Harrison&#x27;s novel, &quot;Becoming Kirrali Lewis&quot;, won the State Library of Queensland 2014 black&amp;write! Indigenous Writing Fellowship, was shortlisted in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Awards 2016, and was Highly Commended in the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards 2016. &quot;Becoming Kirrali Lewis&quot; is a coming-of-age teen fiction novel about the search by Stolen Generations member Kirrali Lewis for her biological parents, which turns stereotypes on their heads. &quot;Becoming Kirrali Lewis&quot; was published by Magabala Books in 2015.

===&quot;Born, Still&quot;===
Short story, &quot;Born, Still&quot;, was published by the State Library of Queensland in &quot;Writing Black: New Indigenous Writing from Australia&quot;, launched in May 2014, and in the anthology &quot;Flock&quot; published by University of Queensland Press in 2021. &quot;Born, Still&quot; is a gentle reflection on the death of a daughter before birth.

&quot;Born, Still&quot; was subsequently re-worked as a play, workshopped at the National Play Conference in 2018 with a reading at the Melbourne Writers Festival also in 2018.

===&quot;First Nations Monologues&quot;===
&quot;First Nations Monologues&quot; (edited by Harrison) is an anthology of 30 contemporary First Nations playwrights’ most notable theatrical monologues. Published by Currency Press in 2023, it pays homage to the diverse perspectives that resonate throughout Australia.

===&quot;Little J &amp; Big Cuz&quot;===
Harrison has written for Little J &amp; Big Cuz, an Australian First Nations animated television series first screened on the NITV network and subsequently on ABC television. The series won the 2018 Logie Award for Most Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program. Harrison&#x27;s contribution is recorded on IMDb.

===&quot;Healing our communities, healing ourselves&quot;===
In an act of generous courage, Harrison confessed in 2010 to her own struggles with mental health in an essay published in the Medical Journal of Australia. At a time when mental health was a career-ending stigma, she did so as a platform for talking about First Nations&#x27; mental health more broadly. Harrison&#x27;s essay &quot;Healing Our Communities, Healing Ourselves&quot; argued that First Nations people faced the dual challenge of transgenerational trauma and its associated impact on mental health, in parallel with the more widely acknowledged structural barriers. She argued &quot;a healthy First Nations person and community represents best practice&quot; but that &quot;we First Nations workers travel a parallel journey, working to improve our community&#x27;s wellbeing, while sometimes struggling with our own&quot;. In recognition of her contribution to mental health awareness the Medical Journal of Australia awarded Harrison the &quot;Dr Ross Ingram Essay Prize&quot;.

==Other works==
Harrison created and led &quot;Blak &amp; Bright - First Nations Literary Festival&quot; in Naarm (Melbourne) from its inception in 2015 in the role of Artistic Director / Chief Executive Officer until August 2024. &quot;Blak &amp; Bright&quot; is a bi-annual four-day festival celebrating the diverse expressions of First Nations story-tellers, the only major First Nations literary festival in Australia. 

&quot;Indig-curious; Who can play Aboriginal roles?&quot; published by Currency House in 2012 explores the issues raised by First Nations identity in theatre. The essay was derived from Harrison&#x27;s University of Queensland Masters Exegesis.

Harrison contributed a chapter to &quot;Many Voices, Reflections on experiences of Indigenous child separation&quot;, which was published in 2002 by the National Library of Australia, Canberra. This work was also related to the theme of the stolen generations.

<text>David Charles Jones (July 9, 1921 – August 10, 2013) was a United States Air Force general and the ninth chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In this capacity, Jones served as the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the United States Armed Forces. He previously served as the ninth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force and fifteenth commander of the United States Air Forces in Europe.

Jones is best known for his efforts to cement the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the principal military advisor to the President, as opposed to being a &quot;first among equals&quot; of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Following his retirement from active duty in 1982, he continued to emphasize the importance of such reform, which contributed to the passage of Goldwater-Nichols Act.

==Early life==
Born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, and raised in Minot, North Dakota, Jones graduated from Minot High School and attended both the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks and Minot State Teacher&#x27;s College. While attending college, he received his private pilot license from the Civilian Pilot Training Program. In April 1942, he left college to join the United States Army Air Forces.

==Military career==
In February 1943, Jones graduated from Roswell Army Airfield flight school in New Mexico, received his pilot wings, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Air Forces. After serving as a flying instructor in New Mexico, Arizona and Texas, Jones was assigned to the 3rd Emergency Rescue Squadron of the Fifth Air Force in Japan in 1945. He began as a unit pilot, flying Catalina flying boats, and rose to command the squadron.

From 1948 to 1949 Jones was a unit instructor and then assistant operations and training officer with the 2236th Air Force Reserve Training Center, Godman Field, Kentucky. Also during this period, he attended specialized professional military training courses.

Jones was assigned to the 19th Bombardment Squadron at March AFB, California, in January 1950. During his years with the 19th, he rose to aircraft commander, then operations officer and finally commander of the squadron. He flew more than 300 hours on combat missions over North Korea, when the squadron was one of the first bombardment units committed to the Korean War. In May 1953 he transitioned from bombers to tankers, taking command of the 22nd Air Refueling Squadron at March. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in June 1953, he remained at March but returned to bombers the following year as commander of the 33rd Bombardment Squadron.
Jones next served at Headquarters Strategic Air Command (SAC), Offutt AFB, Nebraska, during SAC&#x27;s build-up period. He was assigned initially in September 1954 as an operations planner in the bomber mission branch and remained there until January 1955, when General Curtis LeMay selected him as his aide. Promoted to colonel in April 1957, Jones became director of materiel and later deputy commander for maintenance of SAC&#x27;s 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle AFB, California.

Jones was a 1960 graduate of the National War College. Following that, Jones was assigned to the Air Staff&#x27;s operations directorate for four years. As chief of the manned systems branch, he worked on the B-70 bomber project. He then served as deputy chief and chief of the Strategic Division. After F-100 and F-4 training, Jones assumed command of the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing, Eglin AFB, Florida, at its activation in 1965 and bought it to operational status.

Jones then served in key staff assignments with United States Air Forces in Europe. He received his second star in November 1967. In February 1969 Jones was assigned to Headquarters Seventh Air Force, Tan Son Nhut Airfield, Vietnam, as deputy chief of staff for operations and became vice commander in June. Promoted to lieutenant general, he returned to SAC in August 1969 as commander of the Second Air Force, headquartered at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.

In April 1971, Jones returned to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) as vice commander in chief. He assumed command of USAFE and the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force in August and was promoted to general in September. In his North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) capacity as commander of the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, Jones directed an international planning team that integrated central region air forces into a more cohesive organization. Key to that effort was his creation of a small operational and planning headquarters, Allied Air Force, Central Europe.

== United States Air Force Chief of Staff ==
Capping a career that had included operational and command positions in bomber, tanker, training and tactical fighter units as well as headquarters staff positions, General Jones was nominated by President Richard Nixon as the ninth Chief of Staff of The United States Air Force in July 1974, following the appointment of General George S. Brown as the eight Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff. As Chief of Staff of The United States Air Force, General Jones responsible for administering, training and equipping all of the airmen employing in the world&#x27;s largest Air Force. During his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff General Jones also advocated for the development of high-technology of future weapons systems and also reorganized the Air Force command structure. He supported modernization with such systems as the F-15, F-16, the A–10, and the E–3A.


General Jones emphasized the needs of modernized the Air Force following the end of the Vietnam War and in order to stop the Soviet armored thrust. As a result, the Fairchild A-10 Warthog aircraft was built to become the primary survivable tank killer. That program was followed by the General Dynamics EF-111 to counter Soviet air mobile defenses, along with the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS, which served to provide picture and detail of the airborne battlefield. Much of the modernization program was focused on the European area, where the United States developed initiatives in response to Department of Defense and congressional interest for an increase in the capability of NATO.

During his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff General Jones also oversaw the improvements in the working relationship between the Air Force, Army and Navy. General Jones also developed an emerging concepts of air and ground integration that would eventually result in the Air-Land Battle Doctrine. The concepts and the battle doctrine was developed in order to oppose the growing Soviet conventional threat within the Central Europe. In May 1975 following a cable from United States Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia which informed an SOS and Mayday signals from a U.S. merchant vessel SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; that has been attacked and seized by Khmer Rouge militia following their took control of Cambodian Capital Phnom Penh; this event lead to a military crisis known as the Mayaguez incident. During the incident, General Jones served as the acting Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff due to the fact that Chairman Gen. George S. Brown was in Europe for a NATO Summit at that time of the Mayaguez Incident. General Jones advised President Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and the National Security Council on a range of military options, including the plan for military operations to rescue the crew of SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot;. The United States initially launch a rescue operation, by deploying U.S. Marines to recaptured the SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; and also attacked the island of Koh Tang, on which it was believed the crew of the SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; was held imprisonment by the Khmer Rouge. The crew of the SS &quot;Mayaguez&quot; was finally rescued, however General Jones saw a complex communication and relationship between the military and the civilian officials during the &quot;Mayaguez&quot; Incident. The &quot;Mayaguez&quot; crisis was the one that eventually convinced General Jones of the need for change within the military and civilian relationship, especially during a military crisis and wartime situation. This became a crucial factor in the enactment of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. On May 31, 1978, Jones was awarded the Order of the Sword, the Air Force enlisted force&#x27;s highest honor for officer leadership.

== Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ==

General David C. Jones was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 21 June 1978, replacing General George S. Brown, who retired due to ill health. General Jones became the only Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was not a graduate from either a college or service academy. General Jones became the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during a period of increasing of the Soviet military arsenal and the emerging of Muslim militias within the Persian Gulf region that was deemed as a threat within the Western world nations. General Jones also oversaw the increased funding for defense in response to the Soviet threat and due to the continuing Joint Chiefs of Staff advocacy of strategic force modernization.

Jones accompanied President Jimmy Carter to Vienna, Austria, in June 1979 for the final stage of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II negotiations with the USSR. When the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan raised fears that Soviet forces there might move into neighboring Iran, where an anti-Western militant Islamic regime had taken power in early 1979, Carter created a rapid deployment force for Southwest Asia to counter any such attempt in the region. Subsequently, at the direction of the secretary of defense, Jones oversaw planning for the transformation of the Rapid Defense Force into a regional unified command. The planning for what in 1983 became the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) was essentially completed during his chairmanship. Jones also oversaw the planning for the rescue of the U.S. embassy personnel taken hostage in November 1979 by followers of the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, and he survived the criticism for that rescue mission&#x27;s failure.

=== Goldwater-Nichols Act ===
During his second term as chairman, Jones worked to make the chairman, rather than the corporate JCS, the principal military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense, arguing that such a change of the National Security Act would improve the quality and timeliness of military advice and the combined readiness and effectiveness of the nation&#x27;s combat forces. Jones continued his efforts toward that goal after his retirement as chairman of the JCS and saw it come to fruition with the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act in 1986.


Jones continued to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the first years of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Presidency in 1981. He retired from active-duty within the United States Air Force after his second term period as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff finished on June 18, 1982. In 1989 military history book &quot;Four Stars: The Inside Story of The Forty-Year Battle Between The Joint Chiefs of Staff and America&#x27;s Civilian Leaders&quot;, historian Mark Perry wrote that General David C. Jones had earned a reputation as &quot;a good service manager&quot; who &quot;welcomed change&quot; during his tenure as both U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Jones was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1974, an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Louisiana Tech University in 1975, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree from Minot State College in 1979. Jones received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Roger Staubach in 1979. Jones was the final Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be decorated for service in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.

Jones was a member of the Air Force Association, the Falcon Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Alfalfa Club, the Bohemian Club and the Family.

==Personal life and death==
In 1942, he married Lois Tarbell (1921–2009). They had three children, two daughters Susan and Kathy; and a son, David Curtis.

Jones died August 10, 2013, at a military retirement community in Potomac Falls, Virginia at age 92. He had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Jones was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on October 25, 2013.

<text>David D. &quot;Deacon&quot; Jones (December 9, 1938 – June 3, 2013) was an American professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons. He played for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, and Washington Redskins. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980.

Jones specialized in sacks, a term that he coined. Nicknamed &quot;the Secretary of Defense&quot;, Jones is considered one of the greatest defensive players ever. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Jones &quot;most valuable Ram of all time,&quot; and former Rams head coach George Allen called him the &quot;greatest defensive end of modern football&quot;.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Eatonville, Florida, and lived in a four-bedroom house with his family of ten. Jones attended Hungerford High School, where he played football, baseball, and basketball. During high school, Jones developed a lump in his thigh and learned that it was a tumor; he had surgery to remove it by Dr. Ron Alegria.

Late in life, Jones told &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; that when he was 14 years old, he witnessed a carload of white teenagers laughingly hit an elderly black woman with a watermelon. The woman died days later from the injury, and Jones recalls that there was never a police investigation. &quot;Unlike many black people then, I was determined not to be what society said I was,&quot; Jones later recounted. &quot;Thank God I had the ability to play a violent game like football. It gave me an outlet for the anger in my heart.&quot;

==College career==
Jones&#x27; college football career consisted of a year at South Carolina State University in 1958, followed by a year of inactivity in 1959 and a final season at Mississippi Vocational College, now known as Mississippi Valley State University, in 1960.

South Carolina State revoked Jones&#x27; scholarship after they learned that he participated in a protest during the Civil Rights Movement. However, one of the assistant football coaches at South Carolina State was leaving to coach at Mississippi Vocational, and told Jones and some of the other African-American players that he could get them scholarships at the new school. While he was playing at Mississippi Vocational, he and his African-American teammates had to sleep in cots in the opposing team&#x27;s gym because motels would not take them on numerous occasions.

==Professional career==

Due to a lack of television coverage and modern scouting networks, Jones was largely overlooked during his college career. According to an NFL Films interview with writer Ray Didinger, &quot;Deacon was discovered kinda by accident. The Rams were scouting some running backs and they found this defensive tackle who was outrunning the running backs that they were scouting.&quot; Jones was selected in the 14th round of the 1961 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He then earned a starting role as a defensive end and teamed with tackle Merlin Olsen to give Los Angeles a perennial All-Pro left side of the defensive line. He became a part of the Fearsome Foursome defensive line of the Rams (along with Lamar Lundy, Rosey Grier, and Olsen), which is now considered to have been one of the best defensive lines of all time.

Jones won consensus All-Pro honors five straight years from 1965 through 1969 and was second-team All-Pro in 1964, 1970, and 1972. He was also in seven straight Pro Bowls, from 1964 to 1970, and was selected to an eighth after the 1972 season with the San Diego Chargers. He was voted the team&#x27;s Outstanding Defensive Lineman by the Los Angeles Rams Alumni in 1962, &#x27;64, &#x27;65, and &#x27;66. In 1971, Jones suffered a severely sprained arch, which caused him to miss four starts, and he ended the season with 4½ sacks, his career-low to that point.

Jones was traded along with Lee White and Greg Wojcik from the Rams to the San Diego Chargers for Jeff Staggs, a second-rounder in 1972 (30th overall) and a second and third-rounder in 1973 (31st and 60th overall) on January 29, 1972. He was named San Diego&#x27;s defensive captain and led all Chargers&#x27; defensive linemen in tackles and won a berth on the AFC Pro Bowl squad. He concluded his career with the Washington Redskins in 1974. In the final game of his NFL career, the Redskins allowed him to kick the point-after-touchdown for the game&#x27;s last score. Along the way, Jones was named the Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Week four times: week 14, 1967; week 12, 1968; week 11, 1969; and week 10, 1970.

An extremely durable player, Jones missed only six games of a possible 196 regular-season encounters in his 14 National Football League seasons.
===Sacks===
Jones was considered by many to revolutionize the position of defensive end. He was credited with coining the phrase &quot;sacking the quarterback&quot;. He once stated that a quarterback being sacked devastated the offense in the same way that a city was devastated when it was sacked. In 1999, Jones provided a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter with some other detailed imagery about his forte: &quot;You take all the offensive linemen and put them in a burlap bag, and then you take a baseball bat and beat on the bag. You&#x27;re sacking them, you&#x27;re bagging them. And that’s what you&#x27;re doing with a quarterback.&quot;

What separated Jones from every other defensive end was his speed and his ability to make tackles from sideline to sideline, which was unheard of in his time. He also was the first pass rusher to use the head slap, a move that he said was, &quot;to give myself an initial head start on the pass rush, in other words an extra step. Because anytime you go upside a man&#x27;s head … or a woman; they may have a tendency to blink they [sic] eyes or close they eyes. And that&#x27;s all I needed.&quot; &quot;The head slap was not my invention, but Rembrandt, of course, did not invent painting. The quickness of my hands and the length of my arms, it was perfect for me. It was the greatest thing I ever did, and when I left the game, they outlawed it.&quot;

&quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot; reported he accumulated 173.5 sacks over his career. The total would be third on the all-time sack list, which would have ranked first all-time at the time of his retirement by a substantial margin.

In 1964, Jones had 22 sacks in only 14 games. If official, this would have stood as an NFL record until Al Baker&#x27;s 1978 campaign in which he totaled 23 sacks. (The term &quot;sack&quot; had not yet been coined at the time, and official sack statistics were not recorded by the NFL until 1982.) In 1967, Jones had 21.5 sacks; he again tallied 22 sacks in 14 games the following year.

==After football==

===Acting===
Jones worked as a television actor, and appeared in numerous TV programs since the 1970s, most often appearing in cameo roles. He appeared in an episode of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; where he and Oscar were in a television commercial selling shaving products. He appeared as himself on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, and in a &quot;Bewitched&quot; episode in 1969, he played a guard to the Giant&#x27;s castle in &quot;Sam &amp; the Beanstalk&quot;. Jones also played himself on an episode of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; in 1978.

In 1978, he played a Viking named Thall in &quot;The Norseman&quot;. Fellow Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff joined Jones in the film, also portraying a Norseman. That same year, Jones portrayed a fierce defensive lineman named Gorman in the film &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;.

In the series &quot;G vs E&quot;, he played himself, but as an agent of &quot;The Corps&quot;. He also played a role in the hit show, &quot;ALF&quot;, where he played a father figure to Alf.

===Broadcasting===
Jones served as a color analyst for Rams broadcasts on KMPC radio in the 1994 season, teaming with Steve Physioc and Jack Snow. In 1998, shortly before Super Bowl XXXII between the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers, Jones correctly predicted the Broncos, 11.5-point underdogs, would win the game and Terrell Davis would be named MVP of the game.

===Business===
Jones worked for many companies, including the Miller Brewing Company, Haggar Clothing, Pacific Coast Medical Enterprises, and Epson America, and represented the NFL and Champion Products as spokesman for their Throwback campaigns. Jones was also chairman for AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals in their national hypertension awareness program.

===Community involvement===
NFL.com reported that Jones made several trips to Iraq to visit the U. S. military.

Jones served as the president and CEO of the Deacon Jones Foundation, an organization he founded in 1997 &quot;to assist young people and the communities in which they live with a comprehensive program that includes education, mentoring, corporate internship, and community service.&quot;

===Bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles===
Jones was one of the many former L.A. Rams players who disliked the team&#x27;s controversial relocation to St. Louis in 1995. He was adamant in interviews and appearances that he played for Los Angeles, not St. Louis, and considered the Rams franchise there a different team that should have a different name. He participated in many grassroots efforts to bring NFL football back to L.A. and also voiced support on many new stadium proposals . The Rams eventually returned to Los Angeles in 2016 after Jones had died.

==Honors==
He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1980, and was named to the NFL&#x27;s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994. In 1999, he was ranked number 13 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranked player to have played for the Rams franchise, the highest-ranked defensive end, and the second-ranked defensive lineman behind Bob Lilly. The same year, he was named by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as the &quot;Defensive End of the Century&quot;. In 2010, he was named to the inaugural class of the Black College Football Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Jones stated that he gave himself the nickname Deacon after joining the Rams because too many David Joneses were in the local phone book. &quot;Football is a violent world and Deacon has a religious connotation,&quot; he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1980. &quot;I thought a name like that would be remembered.&quot;

Jones&#x27; wife Elizabeth is the chief operating and financial officer of the Deacon Jones Foundation, based in Anaheim Hills, California, the community in which the couple lived.

Another Jones he was confused with, Melvyn &quot;Deacon&quot; Jones from Richmond, Indiana was a rhythm and blues singer during his football days, and was backed by the band Nightshift, which later became the group War. Jones sang onstage with Ray Charles, performed on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; in 1967 and 1968, and on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in 1970. Jones was the inspiration for the name of the 1977 song &quot;Deacon Blues&quot; by Steely Dan.

===Death===
On June 3, 2013, Jones died at 74 of natural causes after suffering from lung cancer and heart disease at his home in Anaheim Hills, California. Jones&#x27;s death left Rosey Grier as the last surviving member of the Fearsome Foursome, the L.A. Rams defensive line which is widely considered the best such unit in the history of the NFL. Of the former defensive standout, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said, &quot;Even with his fellow Hall of Famers, Deacon Jones held a special status. He was an icon among the icons.&quot; Washington Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen, son of Jones&#x27;s longtime coach George Allen, called him &quot;one of the greatest players in NFL history. Off the field... a true giant.&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; columnist Peter King noted at his death that Jones had a profound effect on the way defense was played in the NFL and cited the influence on such later NFL stars as Lawrence Taylor, Deion Sanders, and Michael Strahan. As a tribute to Jones, the NFL created the Deacon Jones Award, which is given annually to the league leader in sacks.

<text>Holyport (pronounced &quot;Hollyport&quot;) is a suburban village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about south of Maidenhead town centre in the English county of Berkshire.

== Etymology ==
The name &#x27;Holyport&#x27; originates from Old English &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;muddy market-town&#x27;, although a local folk etymology holds that the village was a stopping-off point for pilgrims travelling from Canterbury to St David&#x27;s. The first element had become &#x27;Holy-&#x27; by the end of the 14th Century.

== Amenities ==
The village has a butcher, a newsagent, a grocery, a small café and a hairdresser as well as the post office and a doctor&#x27;s surgery. Holyport has four public houses - The George, The Belgian Arms, The White Hart and The Jolly Gardener. Also in the village are Holyport Church of England Primary School, Holyport College and Holyport Cricket Club. An hourly bus service operated by Courtney Coaches connects the village to Windsor and Maidenhead. Holyport has a nature reserve on the edge of the village, Bray Pit. 

There is also a village hall, Holyport Memorial Hall, tennis court, children&#x27;s playground and playing field, all of which are owned and managed by the Holyport Community Trust, a Charitable Incorporated Organisation. 

== Sport and leisure ==
The village&#x27;s football team Holyport F.C. plays in the Hellenic Football League. Its cricket club plays in the Chilterns Cricket League on Saturdays and in friendlies against local clubs on Sundays.

Holyport has one of the world&#x27;s few real tennis courts, at the Royal County of Berkshire Real Tennis Club, built in 1889.

The Holyport Village Fair is held on the village green on the first Saturday in June every year. The fair was established to raise funds to build the Memorial Hall and held at Foxley Manor on 21st July 1945. It draws large crowds from the surrounding area and it is understood 2020-21 are the only two years since the fair&#x27;s inception that it did not take place - due to Covid.

== Notable residents ==
Holyport was the final residence of veteran BBC TV presenter Frank Bough until his death in 2020. Stirling Moss, the racing driver, lived in the village, and was a member of the Bray and Holyport Scout Group.

==In popular culture==
Monty Python filmed a Maypole dance-related sketch on the green, the film &quot;Happy is the Bride&quot; was shot here and in Bray, and Joan Collins filmed an advertisement in Holyport. The movie &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; was partly filmed in Holyport. A scene from the 1995 Mr. Bean episode, entitled &#x27;Tee off Mr. Bean&#x27;, was filmed on Holyport Green.

<text>Francisco José Rodrigues da Costa (born 1 December 1974), known as Costinha (), is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He was also a manager.

Best known for his tackling and positioning, as well as his athleticism, stamina and workrate, he played for clubs in Portugal, France, Russia, Spain and Italy. He won eight trophies with Porto, including the 2004 Champions League.

Costinha played more than 50 times with Portugal, appearing with the national team in one World Cup and two European Championships and being part of the squad that reached the final in Euro 2004. After retiring, he worked as a manager for Beira-Mar, Paços Ferreira, Académica and Nacional.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Costinha was born in Lisbon to an Angolan father, who had immigrated to the Portuguese capital in the 1960s. A childhood Sporting CP fan, he began his career in the third division with Clube Oriental de Lisboa, A.D. Machico and C.D. Nacional.

===Monaco===
In the summer of 1997, Costinha signed a five-year contract with La Liga&#x27;s Valencia CF, but backed out when manager Jorge Valdano wanted to loan him to Villarreal CF; he then caught the interest of French club AS Monaco FC who acquired him through the influence of agent Jorge Mendes. After a tentative first season he became an important first-team member, helping with 28 matches and one goal to the 1999–2000 conquest of the Ligue 1 championship; he was part of a talented side which ousted Manchester United from the UEFA Champions League in 1998, on the away goals rule.

===Porto===
Costinha joined FC Porto on a five-year deal in May 2001, and made his Primeira Liga debut on 12 August aged nearly 27; he was sent off in a 1–0 loss away to Sporting. He went on to be an instrumental midfield element in the northerners&#x27; two consecutive national championships. On 9 March 2004, he scored against and effectively knocked out Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16; Porto went on to win the title, beating his former side Monaco 3–0 in the final.

===Later career===
Again a starter throughout most of the 2004–05 campaign, Costinha was sold to FC Dynamo Moscow in May 2005 for €4 million alongside teammates Maniche and Giourkas Seitaridis, following Derlei who left in January. The following month, he was suspended after an incident in a training camp in Israel. Unsettled, he moved to Atlético Madrid on a two-year contract ahead of 2006–07.

Costinha was released by the Spaniards in August 2007, joining Atalanta BC of Serie A, where he appeared very rarely throughout his spell – only one match, in his first season – due to serious injuries and later because he was not considered fit to play competitively, despite him having the highest salary in the first team (€700,000 per year, in a contract due to expire in June 2010). The club tried to agree a mutual termination of the contract with him, and also attempted unsuccessfully to rescind it through the Italian Football League.

==International career==
Costinha made his debut for Portugal on 14 October 1998, in a 3–0 home win over Slovakia for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers; he entered as a 67th-minute substitute in place of Rui Costa. He was selected for the final stages, where he scored an injury time header against Romania (same score).

He also played at Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournaments. During the latter, on 25 June, he took part in the Battle of Nuremberg, being one of four players sent off in the 1–0 round-of-16 victory over the Netherlands after two bookable offences, the second being a handball.

Costinha finished his international career with 53 caps and two goals, having been rarely called during the Euro 2008 qualifying stage.

==Coaching career==
===Director===
On 23 February 2010, the 35-year-old Costinha left Atalanta by mutual consent. He immediately retired, being named shortly afterwards as Sporting&#x27;s director of football, succeeding the sacked Ricardo Sá Pinto, his former international teammate. On 9 February 2011, the day after an interview to Sport TV in which he criticised the club&#x27;s board of directors, he was dismissed.

In June 2011, in the same capacity, Costinha joined Servette FC, with the Swiss team being managed by countryman João Alves. It was reported that the pair did not see eye to eye on certain issues, and in November 2011, Alves was relieved of his duties and replaced by João Carlos Pereira. The team&#x27;s results worsened under Pereira and in April 2012, both Pereira and Costinha were fired, with Alves being reinstated as manager; Costinha reportedly contested the terms of his removal, claiming that his contract extended until June 2013.

===Beira-Mar, Paços Ferreira and Académica===
Costinha was hired as manager of S.C. Beira-Mar on 18 February 2013, replacing Ulisses Morais. His debut five days later was a 1–0 defeat at Vitória de Setúbal. He left the club on 22 May, after its top-flight relegation.

On 12 June 2013, Costinha was appointed at fellow top-tier F.C. Paços de Ferreira, who had made the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time in their history; his midfield partner for Portugal and three teams, Maniche, was hired as assistant. Costinha was sacked after only four months, however, due to poor results.

Costinha took over at Académica de Coimbra, recently relegated from the top division, on 20 June 2016. Maniche again assisted him, until leaving for personal reasons in October.

===Nacional===
On 30 May 2017, Costinha was appointed as manager of Nacional. In his first year, they were promoted back to the top tier as champions.

Costinha left a year later by mutual consent, due to the Madeira team&#x27;s relegation as second-bottom. Negative highlights included a 10–0 loss against eventual champions S.L. Benfica, on 10 February 2019.

Costinha returned to Nacional – again relegated from the main division – on 28 June 2021, on a one-year deal. He left on 20 September, having achieved a win and a draw in five games.

<text>Howard Mumford Jones (April 16, 1892 – May 11, 1980) was an American intellectual historian, literary critic, journalist, poet, and professor of English at the University of Michigan and later at Harvard University.

Jones was the book editor for &quot;The Boston Evening Transcript&quot;.

==Background==
Howard Mumford Jones was born on April 16, 1892, in Saginaw, Michigan. He attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison as an undergraduate, winning oratorical contests there 

==Career==
Before moving to Harvard University, Jones was a member of the English faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1925 he approached president Harry Woodburn Chase, lamenting the absence of a bookstore in the town of Chapel Hill, and offered to open one in his office. This eventually became the Bull&#x27;s Head Bookshop, now located in Student Stores.

In February 1954, Jones gave the dedicatory address at the opening of an addition to the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Memorial Library, entitled &quot;Books and the Independent Mind.&quot; The crux of his comments was contained in this comment: &quot;While it is true that we in this nation remain free to be idiotic, it does not necessarily follow that we must be idiotic in order to be free!&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1927, Jones married the former Bessie Judith Zaban, of Atlanta, Georgia, in New York City, and they remained married until his death.

Howard Mumford Jones died age 88 on May 11, 1980, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after a brief illness.

<text>Yuan Chonghuan (; 6 June 1584 – 22 September 1630), courtesy name Yuansu, art name Ziru, was a Chinese politician, military general and writer who served under the Ming dynasty. Remembered as a national hero of Ming China and widely regarded as a culture hero in Chinese culture, he is best known for defending Liaoning from invasions launched by the Jurchen-led Later Jin dynasty. As a general, Yuan Chonghuan excelled as a cannoneer and sought to incorporate European cannon designs into the Ming arsenal.

Yuan&#x27;s military career reached its height when he defeated the Later Jin ruler, Nurhaci, and his army in the first Battle of Ningyuan, that resulted in Nurhaci&#x27;s death. Later on, Yuan also defeated Nurhaci&#x27;s son and successor, Hong Taiji, and his 200,000-strong army composed of mostly ethnic Mongol soldiers at the second Battle of Ningyuan. Yuan met his end when he was arrested and executed by &quot;lingchi&quot; (&quot;slow slicing&quot;) on the order of the Chongzhen Emperor under false charges of treason, which were believed to have been planted against him by the enemy court.

==Early life==
Yuan was born in Dongguan, Guangdong. Another source suggest his ancestors came from Guangxi. During his adolescence, he spent time traveling from town to town. Although he took the imperial examination repeatedly with little success, he gained a lot of practical experience during his travels to the capital. It is said that he befriended several Jesuits during this time and spent much time working on modifying European cannons.

==Early military career==
Yuan passed the imperial examination in 1619 and was appointed as the magistrate of Shaowu county, Fujian. In 1619, the Ming imperial army was defeated by the Jurchens in the Battle of Sarhu. Ming forces suffered successive defeats and in 1622 they were forced to retreat to Shanhai Pass, abandoning all of Liaoning to the Jurchens. After a visit to the front, Yuan was appointed as a second-class secretary in the Ministry of War, then promoted almost immediately to full secretary and supplied with funds for enlisting troops. Yuan&#x27;s rapid promotion was quite notable at the time as he did not have any formal military training at all, save for studying the Confucian classics in order to pass the imperial examination.

Yuan cooperated with the commander-in-chief Sun Chengzong in pushing the frontiers steadily northward, fortifying Ningyuan in 1623. The elderly Sun was an able commander but refused to bribe Wei Zhongxian, an influential court eunuch under the Tianqi Emperor. Consequently, Sun was recalled in 1625 and replaced by Gao Di (), who ordered a general retreat to Shanhai Pass. However, Yuan flatly refused to leave Ningyuan.

Early in the next year, Nurhaci led the Jurchens back across the Liao River. Yuan and his deputies successfully held Ningyuan with the newly mounted and modified &quot;hongyipao&quot; and only 9,000 militiamen against Nurhaci&#x27;s 130,000-strong army. The victory at Ningyuan prevented immediate advances by the Jurchens.

Yuan was said to have studied every aspect of the cannon for it to fire accurately at the position he wanted, and this is given as the reason why Nurhaci, although well-protected by his elite guards in a safe position, was wounded by cannon fire. After the battle, Yuan sent letters to ask the well-being of Nurhaci, as traditionally done by Chinese generals, but Nurhaci returned an insult by calling him duplicitous.

As a result of this victory, the Ming imperial court in Beijing appointed Yuan as the Governor of Liaodong on 27 February 1626, with full authority to handle all forces outside the passes.

During this time, Yuan executed Mao Wenlong, a Ming general regarded as ruthless but talented. Various texts have different opinions of his actions. Many stated this was a mistake since Mao could still be used against the Jurchens. However, Yuan took into account how Mao conducted his battles: Mao&#x27;s tactics usually involved using civilian settlements as a shield for his troops, and during the occupation the civilians suffered tremendously. Mao also used the Joseon kingdom, Ming&#x27;s ally, as a base to launch expeditions against the Jurchens. When the Jurchens entered Joseon, Mao ordered a general retreat of Ming forces. This angered many merchants in the Beijing area who traded in the Korean Peninsula. In addition, Mao was known to have bribed many corrupt eunuchs and officials. Consequently, by executing Mao, Yuan made enemies with some of the most influential people in China.

Taking advantage of Nurhaci&#x27;s death later in the year, Yuan reoccupied Jinzhou. The Jurchens reappeared in June and withdrew after a series of indecisive battles. Yuan was criticised by the partisans of Wei Zhongxian, who stated that he took too long to fight off the Jurchens. Shortly thereafter Yuan was forced into retirement.

==Later military career and death==

In 1628, under the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor, Yuan was reinstated as the field marshal of all the Ming forces in the northeast. He embarked on an ambitious five-year plan for the complete recovery of Liaodong. The Chongzhen Emperor had begun his reign in 1627 at the age of 16, and in 1629 (at the age of 18) he appointed Yuan. In 1629, Yuan was granted the title of &quot;Senior Guardian of the Heir Apparent&quot;. The emperor gave Yuan his Imperial Sword and stated that he would fully support Yuan&#x27;s decisions.

This time Yuan had to face again a larger Jurchen force of over 200,000 troops under Nurhaci&#x27;s successor, Hong Taiji. The Jurchens had incorporated more men into their army, including the newly surrendered Mongols and Ming rebels. They conquered various small tribes in northern China, and defeated Joseon in order to secure it as a tributary. However, the Jurchens never attacked Jinzhou or Ningyuan again. Instead, they bypassed Jinzhou, Ningyuan and Shanhai Pass altogether. They broke through the Great Wall west of Shanhai Pass and reached the north of Beijing in the winter of 1629. Yuan rushed back with a selected veteran force from Ningyuan to defend the capital. He reached Beijing just days before the Jurchens. Outside the city wall of Beijing, he defeated the Jurchen Eight Banners which numbered around 100,000 men, but failed to destroy the Jurchen army. The Jurchens&#x27; surprise attack on Beijing was foiled. Despite the fact that Yuan prevented the Jurchens from even reaching the city wall, Yuan was heavily criticized when he arrived in Beijing, and some eunuchs even accused Yuan of collaborating with the enemy.

The Chongzhen Emperor ordered Yuan&#x27;s arrest during an audience on 13 January 1630. Despite little evidence, Yuan was accused of collusion with the enemy and sentenced to death by &quot;lingchi&quot; (&quot;slow slicing&quot;) at Ganshiqiao () in Beijing. When Yuan was asked for last words before his execution, he produced the following poem: &quot;A life&#x27;s work always ends up in vain; half of my career seems to be in dreams. I do not worry about lacking brave warriors after my death, for my loyal spirit will continue to guard Liaodong.&quot; ()

Imperial records showed he took half a day to die.

Yuan was mourned throughout most of the country outside Beijing and even in the kingdom of Joseon. After his death, many took note of the Ming and their allies&#x27; weak position as favorable conditions for another Jurchen invasion.

It was said that upon hearing of his apparent &quot;betrayal&quot;, many Beijing residents hated Yuan so much that they rushed to buy his body parts so they could eat them as soon as they were sliced off his body. He was left there after the torture, shouting for half a day before stopping. His head, the only recognisable part after the execution, was taken outside the Inner City Wall by a city guard, whose surname was She (), and buried in Huashi near Guangqumen. The guard&#x27;s family have guarded it for generations since. His tomb was recently renovated and renamed the Yuan Chonghuan Memorial, located at Longtan Park.

==Legacy==

Yuan&#x27;s name was cleared nearly a century later by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, after conclusive evidence was found in old archives of the Qing imperial court supporting his innocence. The Qianlong Emperor tried to express his kindness by searching for and rewarding Yuan&#x27;s direct descendants, but failed to find any.

Yuan Chonghuan&#x27;s son defected from the Ming to the Qing and in 1642 was placed in the Han Chinese Plain White Banner. Yuan Chonghuan&#x27;s sixth generation descendant lived during the Taiping rebellion and was the Qing Jiangsu governor, Fumingga (Fuming&#x27;a) ( ) (Han Chinese name Yuan Shifu 袁世福, courtesy name Zhi&#x27;an 治安). Despite being a Han Chinese bannerman ( ) he used a Manchu personal name. From 1866 to 1870 the Qing appointed Fumingga as the Jilin governor in Manchuria. Fumingga had a son named Shoushan (Shou Shan) ( ) (courtesy name Meifeng 眉峰) born in 1860 in Aigun, Heilongjiang in Manchuria. Shoushan along with his younger brother fought in Fengtian and was wounded against the Japanese in the First Sino-Japanese war in 1894. His brother died in the war. Before that Shoushan spent the last 6 years holding hereditary posts in Beijing. After the war he was sent in central China to be appointed to a position in Kaifeng and after that he was sent back to his Aigun hometown as military lieutenant-governor or brigade-general (fudutong). He could speak some Russian, had visited Blagoveshchensk and was an Amur native. The Qing promoted him to Heilongjiang military governor in January 1900. The Fengtian and Jilin governors along with Shoushan all received orders to fight the Russian empire during the Boxer Rebellion in July 1900 from Beijing. The war started with Blagoveshchensk being shelled and Aigun being destroyed by the Russians. A ceasure was attempted by Shoushan to prevent Qiqihar, the capital of Heilongjiang from being occupied. He received no response so Major General Pavel Rennenkampf received Shoushan&#x27;s surrender on 28 August since no response to the ceasefire proposal was made. Shoushan then committed suicide by asking subordinate or a son to kill him by shooting after swallowing gold. Because Shoushan was married to a Mongol woman, his body was sent to Inner Mongolia from Qiqihar before the Russians occupied Qiqihar. Shoushan called for Heilongjiang to be further colonized by Han people to prevent Russian encroachment. Shoushan&#x27;s Mongol wife was a daughter of the Mongol chief of the Dorbod Banner. One of his family members, Yuan Ruizhang (袁瑞昌) who was a northern route barracks officer (北路营官) died in battle against the Tsarist Russian forces in Heihe.

==Physical appearance==
Ming dynasty scholars described Yuan as a short-tempered person with a tiny body frame, and because of his appearance, the Chongzhen Emperor was highly doubtful about his abilities when he first met Yuan.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;wuxia&quot; novel &quot;Sword Stained with Royal Blood&quot; by Jin Yong, Yuan is survived by a fictional son, Yuan Chengzhi, the protagonist of the novel. Yuan Chengzhi was saved by his father&#x27;s subordinates after his father was executed and taken to the Mount Hua School, where he learnt martial arts. Several years later, when he had grown up, he left Mount Hua and traveled around in search of adventure and to redress his father&#x27;s legacy.

Celebrated as a Cantonese hero, during a 2010 rally, protesters in Guangzhou used Yuan&#x27;s battle cry against his Jurchen enemies during the Battle of Ningyuan: &quot;Fuck his mom! Hit the hard!&quot; () as a chant, in reference to the removal of the relevant (English-Cantonese bilingual) plaque from a statue of Yuan.

In the 2017 TVB drama &quot;A General, a Scholar and a Eunuch&quot;, Yuan Chonghuan was portrayed by Edwin Siu.

<text>Hausjärvi is a municipality of Finland. Its seat is in Oitti.

It is located in the province of Southern Finland and is part of the Tavastia Proper region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Geographically, and to some extent politically, Hausjärvi is characterized by its three population centres, Hikiä (population 1,055), Oitti (population 1,855) and Ryttylä (population 1,595). The administrative center of the municipality is Oitti, but politically there sometimes emerges debate on which centres should be developed and/or made targets of public investment.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== History ==

The establishment of permanent settlement in what is now Hausjärvi is presumed to have begun around the 1300s by hunters from Janakkala. The first estates in Hausjärvi sprung up around river Puujoki, and the inhabitants were known to practice hunting as well as slash-and-burn agriculture. Metsäkansa - as Hausjärvi was known in the era around and preceding the Greater Wrath - was made a distinct chapel parish of the mother parish of Janakkala in 1611, which also prompted the construction of its first church in the same year. Hausjärvi was elevated to the status of an independent parish by imperial proclamation in 1855.

The Helsinki–Hämeenlinna and Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railways marked a turning point for the sparsely populated municipality. The villages of Hyvinkää and Riihimäki, in particular, benefited heavily from becoming junction stations, and they were granted independence from Hausjärvi as market towns in 1918 and 1922, respectively. Later on, the village of Oitti, aided by its station on the Riihimäki–Lahti section, became the administrative center of the remaining parts of Hausjärvi.

== Geography ==
The first Salpausselkä cuts through Hausjärvi from the southeast to the northeast. It manifests as a wide ridge in the southeast, and reaches a height of above sea level around lake Erkylänjärvi. Progressing towards the east, the ridge narrows down around Hikiä and splits in two around Oitti. The southern branch is known as Patastenmäki and reaches above sea level. The ridge then decreases in height as it reaches the municipality of Kärkölä in the east. In addition, a fragmented esker reaches from Hikiä to the parish village, Lavinto, Turkhauta and Hämeenlinna, where it is known as Hattelmalanharju.

The most notable river in Hausjärvi is the Puujoki, into which drains lake Pääjärvi in Lammi and Hämeenkoski.

<text>James Kimbrough Jones (September 29, 1839June 1, 1908) was a Confederate Army veteran, plantation owner, lawyer, US congressional representative, United States senator and chairman of the Democratic National Committee from Arkansas.

==Biography==
Born in Marshall County, Mississippi, Jones moved with his father to Dallas County, Arkansas in 1848. He pursued classical studies under a private tutor; he would later study law and was, in 1874, admitted to the bar, practicing in Washington, Arkansas.

During the American Civil War, Jones served in the Confederate Army, and returned to his Arkansas plantation afterward. From 1873 to 1879, he was a member of the Arkansas State Senate, and was president of that body from 1877 to 1879. In 1896 and 1900, he was the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

Jones was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth Congresses (March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1885); he was re-elected to the Forty-ninth but tendered his resignation on February 19, 1885, having been elected to the United States Senate that year. Jones was reelected in 1891 and 1897 and served from March 4, 1885, to March 3, 1903, unsuccessfully seeking reelection in 1902. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs (Fifty-third Congress), Committee on Corporations Organized in the District of Columbia (Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth Congresses), Committee on Private Land Claims (Fifty-fifth Congress.)

<text>Wyong Shire was a local government area located in the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. The incorporation of the Wyong area dates back to 7 March 1906 when the entire area of the Brisbane Water Police District outside of the Town of Gosford was proclaimed as the Erina Shire. From 1 January 1947, local government in the Central Coast region was reorganised, creating &quot;Gosford Shire&quot; and &quot;Wyong Shire&quot;, which comprised Erina Shire north and east of Kulnura, Central Mangrove and Lisarow.

Until its abolition in 2016, Wyong Shire was located around the coastal lake system of Tuggerah Lake, Budgewoi Lake and Lake Munmorah. The area included a coastal strip from Bateau Bay to Budgewoi, some lakeside towns and residential areas, some inland towns on the coastal plain and a sparsely populated region to the west with the rural townships of Yarramalong, Dooralong, Jilliby, and regions of native bush surrounding Kulnura.

Wyong Shire&#x27;s administrative centre was located in the town of Wyong, and the council maintained service and information centres at The Entrance, Tuggerah, and Lake Haven. In May 2016 Wyong Shire was amalgamated with the City of Gosford to form Central Coast Council. The last mayor of Wyong Shire was Cr. Doug Eaton, an independent politician.

==Council history==
===Early history===
The traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the lands now known as the Brisbane Water were the Guringai people of the Eora nation. The Darkingung people occupied large areas inland west towards Rylstone, and north to Cessnock and Wollombi. The area now known as Wyong Shire developed alongside Putty Road, connecting Sydney and the Hunter Valley, with agriculture and timber forming the early industries. On the opening of the railway in 1889 to Newcastle the focus of commercial activity shifted eastward to the Town of Wyong. By 1903 the Norah Head Lighthouse was built and the first few houses and tourist accommodations began to appear along the coast.

In 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, gave the first land grant in the region to William Nash, a former marine of the First Fleet. No further grants were made in the area until 1821. In 1840, the Brisbane Water Police District was proclaimed covering the area from the Hawkesbury River to Lake Macquarie and which administered local government under the control of magistrates. In 1843, the Brisbane Water District Council was proclaimed on the same boundaries as the Police District, and replaced the appointed magistrates with an elected council as part of an early attempt to establish local government administration throughout the colony. This experiment in local government was not very successful, with much public opposition focused on the issue of increased taxation, and a lack of oversight and faulty administration led to the collapse of many of these District Councils. The Brisbane Water District Council had ceased to exist by 1855, and the NSW Parliament passed the &quot;Municipalities Act&quot; in 1858, which allowed for the creation of Municipalities and Boroughs if a petition of as few as 50 signatures was presented to the government. However, no petition was ever sent from the residents of Brisbane Water to the government under this act, and local matters reverted to the police magistrates for determination.

===Erina Shire===
On 11 November 1886, the Town of Gosford was incorporated as the &quot;Borough of Gosford&quot;, with an area of 1,840 acres in and around Gosford. The remaining area of the Brisbane Water Police District outside of Gosford continued to be administered by the police magistrates until 1906. From 7 March 1906, this area became the Erina Shire, when it was proclaimed by the NSW Government Gazette along with 132 other new Shires as a result of the passing of the &quot;Local Government (Shires) Act 1905&quot;. On 16 May 1906, the Shire was divided in to three Ridings (A, B, C) and five temporary Councillors were appointed (John Bourke of Kincumber, John Martin Moroney of Woy Woy, Harold Stanley Robinson of Penang, Manasseh Ward of Gosford, and Alexander Wilkinson of Wyong). The Temporary Council first met at Gosford Courthouse on 13 June 1906 and Manasseh Ward was elected as the chairman.

Following desire from Gosford to merge with Erina Shire, a proposal for a six-ward Erina Shire with Gosford becoming F Riding was subsequently proclaimed and came into effect on 23 January 1908. The new Shire Council Chambers on Mann Street, Gosford, were officially opened on 4 May 1912.

On 27 April 1928 a proposal for the separation of the Woy Woy peninsula was received and the Shire of Woy Woy was subsequently proclaimed on 1 August 1928. Following a January 1936 petition from Gosford and Point Clare residents and a public inquiry that recommended a new Gosford municipality, Erina Shire was divided again to re-form the Municipality of Gosford on 24 October 1936, including the areas of the former Gosford Municipality abolished in 1908 and also new areas from Narara to Woy Woy and Point Clare.

Following significant debate about the provision of electricity undertakings across the Central Coast, including over the split between Erina Shire and Gosford, on 16 October 1942 Gosford Municipality combined with the Shires of Erina and Woy Woy to form the Brisbane Water County Council to provide electricity to the combined area of the three councils. The County Council operated as an electricity and gas supplier and retailer and was managed by representatives of the three councils. The County Council operated until its amalgamation with the Sydney County Council from 1 January 1980.

===Wyong Shire===
In June 1945, Erina Shire resolved to investigate the reconstitution of local government on the Central Coast into two shires and following further discussions a formal proposal was presented to the Minister for Local Government, Joseph Cahill, in October 1945. Nevertheless, the proposal proved divisive, with Gosford and the Wyong section of Erina Shire in favour and the rest of Erina Shire and Woy Woy Shire opposed. The formal government inquiry subsequently supported the proposal and in April 1946, Cahill notified the councils of his intention to proceed. On 1 January 1947, part of Erina Shire, all of Woy Woy Shire and the Municipality of Gosford formed Gosford Shire, and the remainder of Erina Shire north and east of Kulnura, Central Mangrove and Lisarow formed Wyong Shire.

Following the changes, the new Wyong Shire Council initially rented the old Erina Shire offices in Gosford, but soon acquired some army huts from Cowra and had them moved to Wyong to serve as temporary Council Chambers, which were officially opened by Minister Joseph Cahill on 4 February 1948. These chambers were later replaced by a more substantial Council Administration Building at 2 Hely Street Wyong completed in 1959.

With Gosford establishing a Library Service in 1948, Wyong Shire took longer to deliver its own Library Service by 1959, having delayed a proposal on cost grounds in 1951, and held a referendum on the question in December 1953 which was resolved in favour of adopting the &quot;Library Act, 1939&quot;. Wyong Shire Council formally adopted the act in 1958 and opened the first public library service on the ground floor of the Council Chambers in May 1959. The Wyong Library Service eventually expanded to five branches at Toukley, The Entrance, Tuggerah (1995), Lake Haven (2002), and Bay Village.

===Establishment of Central Coast Council and abolition of Wyong Shire Council===
In 2015 a review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that Wyong Shire and Gosford City councils merge to form one single council with an area of and support a population of approximately 331,007. This proposal was supported Wyong Shire and Gosford City councils, who had submitted the proposal to merge as part of the NSW Government&#x27;s &quot;Fit for the Future&quot; reform process.

On 12 May 2016, with the release of the &quot;Local Government (Council Amalgamations) Proclamation 2016&quot;, the Central Coast Council was formed from Wyong Shire and Gosford City councils. The first meeting of the Central Coast Council was held at the Wyong Civic Centre on 25 May 2016, with meetings alternating between Gosford and Wyong.

==Water supply==
The first centralised water supply system was implemented in Wyong in 1929–1930 when a reservoir was constructed on Chapman Hill and water was pumped to it from the Wyong River, with the northern areas of Wyong Shire covered from the 1950s. In 1965 the Entrance Water Supply Scheme officially opened, which provided water to most of Wyong Shire, which included the Mooney Mooney Dam (1961), the Mardi Dam and Wyong River Weir (1962). In 1977 Gosford and Wyong councils agreed to share the costs of operating, building and maintaining water supply throughout the region and the Gosford/Wyong Joint Water Supply Committee was established. The Committee completed construction of the Mangrove Creek Dam in 1978–1982.

This committee became the Gosford/Wyong Councils&#x27; Water Authority in 1998, but was superseded by the Central Coast Water Corporation with the passing of the to create one water supply authority in the region. The eventually came into effect in 2011 when the Gosford/Wyong Councils&#x27; Water Authority Board was dissolved and Water Corporation Board was appointed. The Central Coast Water Corporation ceased to exist with the amalgamation of Gosford and Wyong Councils, with the establishment of a business unit within Central Coast Council to manage water supply.

==Warnervale Airport==
In 1972–1973, Wyong Shire Council developed a large site in Warnervale as an airstrip for light aircraft, which became Warnervale Airport. However, early on in its history, the airport was earmarked as a potential source of economic growth in the region, with the State Government&#x27;s 1977 Structure Plan for the Gosford-Wyong area designating Warnervale as a regional airport for general aviation, commuter operations and airport related industry.

In 1994 Wyong Shire Council opened for expressions of interest in a large redevelopment of the Warnervale area alongside a significant upgrade of the airport, and a proposal by Traders Finance Australia to develop the airport was accepted in January 1995, with contracts being signed in July 1995. A group of local residents, supported by the state MP for Wyong, Paul Crittenden, responded by forming the Central Coast Airport Action Group, and taking the Wyong Shire Council to the Land and Environment Court to fight the move.

In the case of &quot;Jorg Michael Breitkopf v Wyong Council&quot;, which made claims against the validity of the approved Development Application for the airport development, the Court rejected the appeal and ordered payment of costs from Breitkopf, representing the residents group. However, Crittenden moved a private member&#x27;s bill in parliament which was supported by Planning Minister Craig Knowles, and the (&#x27;WAR Act&#x27;) was passed in July 1996. This Act restricted aircraft movements, the length and siting of the runway, and any future expansion of airport operations, and compensated residents for $65,000 in legal bills. This Act severely restricted development of the airport by imposing restrictions on landings and take-offs per day that ensured that a longer runway would never be economically viable, with Wyong Mayor Tony Sheridan noting that the delay in the development had &quot;jeopardised hundreds, if not thousands, of local jobs which would be generated by the airport upgrading and the increase in tourism&quot;.

In 1999, the Wyong Shire Council proposed extending the runway to 1600 metres to cater for jet aircraft of between 50 and 116 passengers, but the plans were eventually scrapped in a council meeting in February 2003 and decided instead on other options for development, including assisting the establishment of a $100 million distribution centre for Woolworths Limited on part of the land initially earmarked for the airport upgrade. In 2015 Wyong Shire Council wrote to the Minister for Planning asking for the WAR Act to be reviewed, and publicly advocated for the Act&#x27;s repeal. This set off a series of NSW Government reviews of the act to determine its future, with the most recent review in April 2020 recommending the repeal of the act. With the public release of this review, in July 2020 the Minister for Planning and Public Spaces, Rob Stokes, announced the government&#x27;s acceptance of all the report&#x27;s recommendations, including the act&#x27;s repeal, and the &quot;Warnervale Airport (Restrictions) Repeal Bill 2020&quot; was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 14 October 2020, receiving royal assent on 24 February 2021 .

==Demographics==
At the , there were people in the Wyong Shire local government area, of these 48.3% were male and 51.7% were female.

==Council==
===Final composition and election method===
Wyong Shire Council was composed of ten councillors elected proportionally as two separate wards (previously known as &quot;ridings&quot;), each electing five councillors. All councillors were elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor was elected by the councillors at the first meeting of the council. The last election was held on 8 September 2012, and the composition of the council was:

A referendum was held on 8 September 2012, and an absolute majority of voters resolved in favour of the election of the mayor by electors for a four-year term, which necessarily increases the number of councillors by one. The change was to take effect at the next elections in September 2016, but Wyong Shire ceased to exist on 12 May 2016. With the first elections of Central Coast Council on 9 September 2017, former A Ward Councillors Doug Vincent and Greg Best were elected to Central Coast Council for Budgewoi Ward and former B Ward Councillor Lisa Matthews was elected to The Entrance Ward.

<text>John Winston Jones (November 22, 1791 – January 29, 1848) was an American politician and lawyer. He served five terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1835 to 1845. He served as Speaker of the House in both the U.S. House of Representatives (1843–1845) and the Virginia House of Delegates (1847).

==Early life and career==
Born November 22, 1791, in Amelia County, Virginia, he graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1813. He practiced law in Chesterfield County, Virginia before being appointed Prosecuting Attorney for Virginia&#x27;s 5th Judicial Circuit in 1818. He was a delegate to the 1829–1830 state constitutional convention.

==Tenure in Congress==
Jones was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1835 and served five terms. As he rose through the ranks of the House, he became chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, replacing future president Millard Fillmore, and House Democratic Leader, succeeding future president James K. Polk.

He was elected to serve as Speaker of the House during the 28th Congress, which convened in 1843 and adjourned in 1845.

Jones declined nomination for a sixth term in Congress and returned to Virginia in 1845.

==Career after Congress==
Upon his retirement from Congress, he returned to the practice of law in Virginia. Among his more prominent cases, he served as lead counsel for Thomas Ritchie Jr., who in 1846 faced trial for his involvement in the infamous duel in which John Hampden Pleasants was fatally wounded. Ritchie won acquittal on the grounds of self-defense.

That same year, Jones was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates and in 1847 was chosen as Speaker. He was elected to a second term in 1847, but did not attend the session due to illness. He resigned his seat on December 17. The vacant House seat was later filled by his son, Alexander.

==Private life==
Jones married Harriet Boisseau in 1815 and together they had three children: Mary Winston, James Boisseau and Alexander. His son-in-law was George W.B. Towns, who was the 39th Governor of Georgia from 1847 to 1851.

Jones died on January 29, 1848. He is buried in the family cemetery at his Dellwood Plantation northwest of Petersburg, Virginia.

<text>Robert T. Jones, (May 28, 1910 – August 11, 1999), was an American aerodynamicist and aeronautical engineer for NACA and later NASA. He was known at NASA as &quot;one of the premier aeronautical engineers of the twentieth century&quot;.

==Early experience==
Jones grew up in the American Midwest farming community of Macon, Missouri. Fascinated by airplanes, he attended Macon High School, built model airplanes from kits and scale drawings, and read aviation magazines and National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) technical reports. He attended the University of Missouri for one year, but dropped out to join the Marie Meyer Flying Circus. There he took flying lessons in return for doing engineering maintenance, as he described it, &quot;carrying gas and patching wing tips&quot;. 

In 1929, engineer Walter Barling left the Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company. Stunt-pilot Charley Fower recommended Jones to the company as someone who “knew everything there was to know about airplanes.” Until the company added English engineer Thomas Kirkup to the team, Jones was their sole engineer. From Kirkup, Jones learned about airplane design and stress analysis. Jones developed the Pobjoy Special air racer, but because of the depression the company was forced to shut down.

With the help of his local congressman, Jones found work as an elevator operator in the House Office Building in Washington, D.C. He spent his spare time studying at the Library of Congress, where he met Albert Francis Zahm, chief of the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Library. At Zahm&#x27;s recommendation, Jones tutored Maryland congressman David John Lewis (also self-educated) in mathematics. Jones also met Max Munk, who encouraged him to take a graduate-level course in aerodynamics that Munk taught in the evening at Catholic University.

==Research==
In 1934, President Roosevelt&#x27;s public works program offered short-term positions for scientific aides at NACA&#x27;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. Jones obtained one of the positions, with recommendations from Zahm, Munk, and Lewis. At the end of the first nine month position, he was rehired through temporary reappointments. A permanent appointment at the initial civil-service level for an Engineer seemed impossible because it required a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. However, the next higher professional grade did not state that requirement. In 1936 Jones was promoted directly to second level engineer. 

In January 1945, Jones developed a theory of the delta wing based on thin-airfoil theory. Others at Langley were sceptical until supersonic testing of models was done by Robert Gilruth and in April by Theodore von Karman. Jones&#x27;s theory was not truly accepted until that summer when Von Karman&#x27;s team of investigators found that German experts had been working on swept-wing designs for several years. Jones&#x27;s thin-wing design ultimately proved superior to thick airfoils developed by Alexander Lippisch in Germany.

In 1946 Jones was given the IAS Sylvanus Albert Reed Award, and transferred to Ames. The genius of Bob Jones seemed, in part, to lie in his remarkable ability to extract the essence of a problem and express it in understandable and useful terms. His approach to problems was always of a fundamental character and often yielded results of broad significance. In addition, Jones&#x27;s wife Doris, an accomplished mathematician, also joined the Ames staff.

Later, still at Ames, Jones promoted the oblique wing. (The first known oblique wing design was the Blohm &amp; Voss P.202, proposed by Richard Vogt in 1942.) Jones&#x27;s wind tunnel studies indicated that such a wing design on a supersonic transport might achieve twice the fuel economy of an aircraft with conventional wings. The concept was flight tested successfully on the NASA AD-1. This unique aircraft had a wing which pivoted about the fuselage, remaining perpendicular to it during slow flight and rotating to angles up to 60 degrees as aircraft speed increased. Analytical and wind tunnel studies by Jones indicated that a transport-sized oblique-wing aircraft flying at speeds up to Mach 1.4 (1.4 times the speed of sound) would have substantially better aerodynamic performance than an aircraft with conventional wings at the same speed. A later DARPA project using a variable sweep oblique wing was the Switchblade.

Jones spent much of his time at Langley working in the Stability Research Division which pioneered many concepts that were incorporated into U.S. aircraft. As a self-trained aerodynamicist and mathematician, Jones built up a national reputation through his perceptive and original work at Langley and Ames.

<text>Miguel Itzigsohn (1908–1978) was an Argentine astronomer and observer of comets, credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 15 asteroids between 1948 and 1954. The outer main-belt asteroid 1596 Itzigsohn, which he discovered himself, was named in his memory on 1 August 1980 ().

Itzigsohn was a professor of spherical and practical astronomy. From 1955 to 1972, he was director of the extrameridian astronomy department at the La Plata Astronomical Observatory, specializing in astrometry and celestial mechanics. He was responsible for the surge in observational and computational activity in studies of minor planets in Argentina following World War II.

<text>Wesley Livsey Jones (October 9, 1863November 19, 1932) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate representing the state of Washington.

Born near Bethany, Illinois, days after the death of his father, who was serving in the Union Army during the American Civil War, Jones grew up working on farms. He taught school before graduating from Southern Illinois College in Enfield, Illinois. He studied law in Chicago, passed the bar, and became active in politics as a Republican. In 1889, he moved to North Yakima, in eastern Washington, where he worked in real estate and practiced law. In 1898, he was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives, where he served five terms. He won a seat in the United States Senate in 1908; he served from 1909 until his death, and served in both leadership positions and as chairman of several Senate committees.

Jones lost his 1932 bid for reelection. He died soon after the November election, but before his term expired in March 1933. He died in Seattle, and was interred at Seattle&#x27;s Bonney-Watson Mortuary.

==Early life==
Jones was born near Bethany, Illinois, the son of Wesley and Phoebe Jones; he was born three days after the death of his father, who was serving as a private in Company B, 41st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. He graduated from Southern Illinois College in Enfield, Illinois, and studied law in Chicago while teaching school at night.

He passed the bar in 1886, and started a law practice in Decatur, Illinois. He also began to get active in politics, having joined the Republican Party. While living in Illinois, Jones campaigned for James G. Blaine for president in 1884, and for Benjamin Harrison in 1888.

==Marriage and family==
In 1886 Jones also married Minda Nelson, starting a family. They had two children together, daughter Hazel E. and son Harry B. Jones. Hazel Jones later married Arthur Coffin.

==Move to Washington state==
In 1889, Jones moved to North Yakima, in eastern Washington. It was a developing area near the Yakima River. He worked in the real estate business and continued to practice law.

The town developed near the Yakama Indian Reservation, where several related peoples had been settled since the mid-nineteenth century, when they signed a treaty ceding millions of acres of land to the United States.

==Political career==
After moving to Washington state, Jones became was active in the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. His leadership roles in the organization gave him name recognition that enabled him to begin a political career. Beginning in 1890, Jones was a sought-after campaign speaker in Washington, and took part in Republican rallies throughout the state.

In 1898, Jones was elected to represent Washington&#x27;s at-large congressional district. He was reelected four times, and served in the U.S. House from March 4, 1899, to March 3, 1909.

In 1908, Jones ran successfully for a seat representing Washington in the United States Senate. He was first elected by the state legislature, but, after passage of the 17th amendment to the US Constitution in 1913, he was later elected by popular vote. Jones was reelected by popular vote in 1914, 1920, and 1926; he served from March 3, 1909, until his death. In 1917, Jones moved from Yakima to Seattle, the state&#x27;s major city and port, located on Puget Sound on the west side of the Cascade Mountains.

In the Senate, Jones advanced to a leadership position as Majority Whip, a post he held from 1924 to 1929. He also served as chairman of several committees, including: Industrial Expositions (61st Congress); Fisheries (62nd Congress); Disposition of Useless Executive Papers (64th and 65th Congresses); Investigate Trespassers Upon Indian Land (65th Congress); Commerce (66th through 71st Congresses); and Appropriations (71st and 72nd Congresses).

Jones was a successful advocate for federal investment in the Pacific Northwest. He secured funding for several irrigation projects, which particularly aided farmers in the more arid eastern part of the state. In 1906 he proposed a bill requiring the Yakama Nation to give up three-quarters of their land in order to gain any irrigation rights. This was opposed not only by the confederated tribes but by their allied European-American advocates, such as Lucullus Virgil McWhorter, a prominent rancher in Yakima who worked to support Native American rights and culture. In 1914 Jones&#x27;s bill finally died in committee.

Jones also gained construction of a large naval facility, the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, on the west side of Puget Sound. It was important to the area economy and continues to provide many jobs in the area. In 1920 he sponsored and secured passage of the Jones Merchant Marine Act, which stipulated that only American ships could carry cargo between American ports, thereby making Alaska dependent on Seattle-based shipping.

Jones was a vocal proponent of prohibition throughout his political career. Initially this aided his popularity, but it likely contributed to his electoral defeat in 1932. The 28-point loss was the second-largest of any major-party nominee in history. More importantly, the Great Depression had set in, and many Republicans lost to Democrats in this election, as voters sought other solutions to growing unemployment. Jones was defeated by Democrat Homer Bone, who swept in with President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Death and burial==
Jones died in Seattle on November 19, 1932, shortly after losing reelection to his Senate seat, but before his final term had expired. A replacement was appointed to serve until the winner of the election took office in 1933. His ashes were interred at Bonney-Watson Mortuary in Seattle.

<text>Francis Michael Jordan (born February 20, 1935) is an American politician and former police chief, who served as mayor of San Francisco from 1992 to 1996. He is a Democrat.

==Early life and education==
Jordan was born in San Francisco in 1935 and graduated from Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory High School in 1953. He studied political science and government at the University of San Francisco during his time on the police force and graduated in 1975.

==Police career and Chief of Police==
Before becoming mayor, Jordan served as the Chief of the San Francisco Police Department from 1986 until 1990, at which point he resigned to run for mayor. He joined the force in 1957 and was named Chief of Police by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein in 1986.

==Mayor of San Francisco==
Jordan succeeded Art Agnos as the Mayor of San Francisco from 1992, until 1996. Jordan continued Agnos&#x27; campaign against the city&#x27;s chapter of Food Not Bombs and introduced a controversial program called Matrix which aimed to deal with the city&#x27;s homelessness problems. During his mayoral tenure Jordan played a role in converting the Presidio Army Base into part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, bringing Bay Area Rapid Transit to the San Francisco International Airport, keeping the San Francisco Giants in the city and balancing the city&#x27;s budget. Jordan was challenged for mayor in the 1995 mayoral election by Willie Brown, who was termed out of the State Assembly. Brown, considered by many to be one of the most powerful African-American politicians in the country, had been defeated only once in a run for public office. Brown and Jordan advanced out of a crowded field to a run-off election, where Brown was victorious. In the 1999 mayoral election, Jordan attempted a comeback bid, but came in third behind Willie Brown and Tom Ammiano.

==Foundation executive==
Since 2001 Jordan has served as special advisor to the president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and is the foundation&#x27;s principal counselor on the impact of potential grants in the nine-county Bay Area. According to the foundation&#x27;s 2007 annual report, in that year nearly $53 million in grants was devoted to the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Personal life==
Jordan holds a degree in government and political science from the University of San Francisco, where he has served on the Business Advisory Council since 1989, and teaching credentials from the University of California. 

Before 2017, Jordan and his wife, Wendy Paskin-Jordan, owned homes in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco and in Santa Rosa, California. However, their Santa Rosa residence was destroyed in the October 2017 Northern California wildfires.

<doc id="774428" wikidata="Q3555993" url="?curid=774428" title="Vernon Jordan">
<text>Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr. (August 15, 1935 – March 1, 2021) was an American business executive and civil rights attorney who worked for various civil rights movement organizations before becoming a close advisor to President Bill Clinton.

Jordan grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, and graduated in 1957 from DePauw University. In the early 1960s, he started his civil rights career, most notably being a part of a team of lawyers that desegregated the University of Georgia. He then continued to work for multiple civil rights organizations until the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he became a close ally and friend of Bill Clinton and he served as part of Clinton&#x27;s transition team. After Clinton&#x27;s departure, Jordan began working with multiple corporations and investment banking firms up until his death. During the 2004 election, he worked for John Kerry&#x27;s campaign.

==Early life and education==
Jordan was born on August 15, 1935, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Mary Belle (Griggs) and Vernon E. Jordan Sr. He had a brother, Windsor. He was a cousin of James Shaw, a musician who was professionally billed as The Mighty Hannibal.

Jordan grew up with his family in the racially segregated Southern United States. He was an honors graduate of David T. Howard High School. Rejected for a summer internship with an insurance company after his sophomore year in college because of his race, he earned money for college for a few summers by working as a chauffeur to former city mayor Robert Maddox, then a banker. Jordan graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, in 1957. In an oral history interview archived at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, an interview conducted in 1964 with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot;, Jordan described his difficulties at DePauw as the only black student in a class of 400. He earned a Juris Doctor at Howard University School of Law in 1960. He was a member of the Omega Psi Phi and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities.

==Legal career and activism==
Jordan returned to Atlanta to join the law office of Donald L. Hollowell, a civil rights activist. The firm, including Constance Motley, sued the University of Georgia for racial discrimination in its admission policies. The suit ended in 1961 with a Federal Court order demanding the admission of two African Americans, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton E. Holmes. Jordan personally escorted Hunter past a group of angry white protesters to the university admissions office.
After leaving private law practice in the early 1960s, Jordan became directly involved in activism in the field, serving as the Georgia field director for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. From the NAACP, he moved to the Southern Regional Council and then to the Voter Education Project.

In 1970, Jordan became executive director of the United Negro College Fund. He was president of the National Urban League from 1971 to 1981.

While still with the National Urban League, Jordan in 1981 said of the Ronald Reagan administration:

That year he resigned from the National Urban League to take a position as legal counsel with the Washington, D.C., office of the Dallas law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld.

==Assassination attempt==
On May 29, 1980, Jordan was shot and seriously wounded outside the Marriott Inn in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He was accompanied by Martha Coleman at the time. Police thought initially that it might have been a domestic incident related to Coleman&#x27;s life. 

Then-president Jimmy Carter visited Jordan while he was recovering, an event that became the first story covered by the new network CNN. 

Terrorist and neo-Nazi Joseph Paul Franklin was charged with attempted murder but acquitted in 1982. However, in 1996, after being convicted of murder in another case, Franklin admitted to having committed the shooting.

==Clinton administration==

Jordan, a friend and political adviser to Bill Clinton, served as part of Clinton&#x27;s transition team in 1992–1993, shortly after Clinton was elected president. In the words of &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

In 1998 Jordan helped Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, find a job after she left the White House, and recommended an attorney. His role was considered controversial given the scandal that the Clinton administration had suffered because of the president&#x27;s involvement with the intern, and Jordan testified several times before the grand jury convened by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. On October 1, 2003, a United States court of appeals rejected Jordan&#x27;s claim for reimbursement for legal services related to assisting Clinton in scandals regarding Lewinsky and Paula Jones. Jordan asked the government to pay him $302,719, but he was paid only $1,215.

In 1998, Jordan was interviewed by CBS news television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Jordan was one of three individuals (with Lewinsky and Sidney Blumenthal) of whom House impeachment managers recorded a deposition.

==Later activities and death==

From January 2000 on, Jordan was a senior managing director with Lazard Freres &amp; Co. LLC, an investment banking firm. He was also a member of the board of directors of multiple corporations, including American Express, J.C. Penney Corporation, Asbury Automotive Group, and the Dow Jones &amp; Company.

He was a member of the board of directors of Revlon, Sara Lee, Corning, Xerox, and RJR Nabisco during the 1989 leveraged buyout fight between RJR Nabisco CEO F. Ross Johnson and Henry R. Kravis and his company KKR. A close friend of Jordan&#x27;s was the Xerox tycoon Charles Peter McColough, who persuaded Jordan to join the board of trustees at Xerox. McColough served as a mentor and friend of Jordan&#x27;s until McColough&#x27;s death.

In the 2004 presidential campaign, Jordan led debate preparation and negotiation efforts on behalf of John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president. That year he was elected president of The Economic Club of Washington, D.C.

In 2006, Jordan served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, which was formed to make recommendations on U.S. policy in Iraq.

In May 2017, Jordan served as the commencement speaker at the 163rd commencement of Syracuse University.

Jordan died at his home in Washington, D.C., on March 1, 2021, at the age of 85, and was buried in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery.

== Marriage and family ==
Jordan married Shirley (née Yarbrough), who died in 1985. They have a daughter, Vickee Jordan Adams, who has worked in public and media relations for Wells Fargo and FGS Global.

In 1986 he remarried, to Ann Dibble Jordan and adopted her four children - Antoinette &quot;Toni&quot;, Mercer, Janice and Jacqueline. He has nine grandchildren, seven from his second wife&#x27;s children, Janice, Mercer, and Toni.

<text>Anker Henrik Jørgensen (13 July 1922 – 20 March 2016) was a Danish politician who served at various times as prime minister and foreign minister of Denmark. Between 1972 and 1982 he led five cabinets as prime minister. Jørgensen was president of the Nordic Council in 1986 and 1991.

He led or represented the Social Democratic Party for well over 30 years. His legacy is ambivalent. Politically, he is considered by many right wing followers to have been largely unsuccessful, having failed to mitigate the impact of the economic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s. Nonetheless, he is generally respected and even loved throughout Denmark for his personal integrity and down-to-earth personality, often exemplified by his refusal to move into the official prime minister residence Marienborg, preferring to stay with his wife in their small apartment in a working class area of Copenhagen.

While he has been described as not having the image of a strong or visionary leader, during his terms as prime minister he managed to maintain wide support for the Danish welfare state. In 1990, he was chosen to travel to Iraq to negotiate the release of a group of Danish hostages with Saddam Hussein.

==Background==
Anker Henrik Jørgensen was born on 13 July 1922 to Johannes Albert Jørgensen and Maria Jørgensen, who both died of tuberculosis while he was a child. He was brought up by close members of his family. He studied at the , but left after the 7th grade to work at a warehouse. Through his job as a warehouse worker he became active in the Special Workers&#x27; Union, from January 2005 merged into Fagligt Fælles Forbund, and in the Social Democratic party.

He served his conscription period in 1943, at the Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron in Næstved. He was part of the fighting when the barracks was attacked by the Germans during Operation Safari. After being repatriated, Anker Jørgensen then joined the resistance in Copenhagen.

==Political career==
===Early politics===
He began his political career early, and in 1950 he became a member of a trade union. He led the Danish General Workers&#x27; Union between 1968 and 1972. Whilst he was chairman of the union, he was elected to the Parliament of Denmark for the first of many times in 1964. As a representative of unskilled workers, a rivalry developed with the leadership of the skilled workers&#x27; unions, such as the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), and its leader , who referred to Jørgensen as &quot;a complete idiot&quot;.

As a member of parliament he was responsible for labour related issues. He located himself on the left wing of the Social Democratic party, speaking out for unskilled workers and the jobless, and criticised the leadership of Parliamentary group leader Per Hækkerup. He also gained attention for his vocal critique of American engagement in Vietnam. Before the 1972 referendum about whether Denmark should join the European Economic Community (ECC), he went against the stated interest of his own labour union, arguing for a yes.

===Prime minister===
A day after the EEC referendum, Jørgensen succeeded Jens Otto Krag as Prime Minister of Denmark. He held this position for 14 months until the 1973 election when he was succeeded by liberal Poul Hartling.
After just over a year in opposition, he returned as prime minister with a Social Democratic minority government. In 1978, he expanded the government by including the Liberals in a grand coalition government in order to deal with economic issues. This coalition lasted until 23 October 1979, and for a brief period of two months in 1978 he concurrently held the position of foreign minister. During this time, Jørgensen presided over the electoral age referendum.

For the rest of his period in office, he led again led a Social Democrat minority government. Unable to muster support for tax increases and spending cuts, he stepped down as prime minister without calling an election on 10 September 1982, ceding the premiership to the Conservative leader Poul Schlüter. He did, however, remain as leader of the Social Democrats until his resignation in 1987 when he was succeeded by Svend Auken. He remained as a member of parliament until 1994.

Throughout his time in office, he showed strong leadership - guiding Denmark into the EEC and further developing Denmark’s social and welfare systems - but his policies also created a huge state budget deficit, which was compensated for by large state loans, increasing the Danish state debt substantially. Numerous cuts were introduced to counteract this.

Nevertheless, a wide range of progressive social reforms were introduced during Jørgensen&#x27;s time as prime minister. A new Social Assistance Act introduced in 1975 simplified administration, provided new types and (in general) substantially higher benefits, together with new criteria for granting benefits. The New Basic Education Act of June 1975 introduced 9-year general, basic education with optional 10th year and pre-school class, and also established the comprehensive principle for basic education. The National Holiday Act of April 1979 extended the obligatory number of holidays to 30 days. Under the law on entitlement to unemployment benefits of June 1976, the permanently self-employed became entitled to membership in unemployment funds, and consequently to unemployment benefits. The Severance Pay Act of November 1978 introduced pre-retirement remuneration which provided unemployment benefits (for those between the ages of 58 and 66) in cases of voluntary retirement. Under the Job Offer Scheme introduced in June 1980, unemployment benefit entitlement for long-term unemployed persons could not be lost without an offer of a new job. A March 1975 law on regulation of housing conditions improved tenant conditions, while the Work Injury Insurance Act of March 1978 provided equality for widows and widowers.

===Later ventures===
He was President of the Nordic Council in 1986 and 1991, and was also head of the Danish delegation to the council during the same terms.

Jørgensen was elected &quot;Dane Of The Year&quot; in 1990 in a survey conducted by Danish Gallup for Berlingske Tidende.
He was an Honorary President of the Socialist International.

He died on 20 March 2016, aged 93 after suffering natural causes in Copenhagen. His funeral was held on 2 April 2016.

==Personal life==
In 1948, he married Ingrid Kvist Pedersen (17 August 1922 – 18 October 1997) whom he remained married to until her death from motor neuron disease. They had 4 children. Throughout this period, he lived in the working-class area of Sydhavnen, an inner city district of Copenhagen. In 2008, 86 years old, he finally left the Sydhavnen apartment, moving to an elderly care centre.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Karl (Johann Nepomuk Karl Borromäus Josef Franz de Paula; 6 July 1724 – 22 December 1748) was the Prince of Liechtenstein between 1732 and 1748. 

== Early life==
He was the son of Joseph Johann Adam, Prince of Liechtenstein and his second wife, Countess Maria Anna Katharina of Oettingen-Spielberg (1693-1729).

== Life ==
When his father died, Johann Nepomuk Karl was only eight and his uncle Josef Wenzel ruled as regent and took care of his nephew&#x27;s education, preparing him for his future role. When Johann Nepomuk Karl took over the rule of his domains alone in 1745, it seemed that his uncle had taught him nothing, because the prince soon neglected the government and otherwise had seen little economic success.

Because of the evident inability of the prince, a royal Hungarian and Bohemian royal chamberlain was appointed to rule. The prince died shortly afterwards in 1748 at Wischau aged 24 years, being the youngest Prince of Liechtenstein to die.

==Marriage and issue==

In Vienna on 19 March 1744 Johann Nepomuk Karl married his cousin Maria Josepha, Countess of Harrach-Rohrau (20 November 1727 – 15 February 1788), daughter of Count Friedrich August von Harrach-Rohrau and his wife, Princess Maria Eleonora of Liechtenstein (1793-1757). They had three children:

* Princess Maria Anna (October 1745 – 27 April 1752).
* Prince Joseph Johannes Nepomuk Xaver Gotthard Adam Franz de Paula Frederick (5 May 1747 – 20 May 1747).
* Princess Maria Antonia Josepha Theresia Walburga (posthumously 13 June 1749 – 28 May 1813), married on 17 January 1768 to Prince Wenzel von Paar.

<text>William Arthur Carr (October 24, 1909 – January 14, 1966) was an American athlete and double Olympic champion in 1932. Called the &quot;Arkansas flyer,&quot; Carr never lost a race during his college and Olympic career.

==Early life and education==
Carr was born and raised in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. His parents were Ann Holmes and William L. Carr, a traveling salesman with the Mann-Tankersley Drug Co. He received his elementary school education at Lakeside School in Pine Bluff.

He attended Pine Bluff High School in 1925. In his freshman year, he joined the track team because he was too small for basketball or football. He demonstrated skill at jumping, but he broke both ankles leaping over a bar and had resign late in the season.

Carr was recruited back to the high school track team in 1927. He received national attention at the spring state meet in Arkandelphia for his record–making high jump of 6.75 feet and a long jump of 21 feet 4 inches. In addition to winning those two events, he came in second at the 100-yard sprint and 220-yard sprint. In a prior track meet, he had already matched the Arkansas record in the 100-yard event. As a result, national sports writers were calling him the top high school track star in the United States.

A local banker convinced Carr to enroll in the Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania for 1928 in preparation for an Ivy League college. There, he was coached by Jimmy Curran. While he was at Mercersburg, they won the annual inter-scholastic track meet to become state champions. Carr was the Pennsylvania champion in the 100-meter sprint, the 200-meter sprint, and the long jump, setting a state record for the latter. He graduated from Mercersburg in the spring of 1929.

Carr was recruited by the University of Pennsylvania and started there in 1929. He was on the track team and served as its co-captain. At Penn, he was a member of the Fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall) and a member of the Sphinx Senior Society. He was president of the sophomore class and received the Golden Spoon as the &quot;most outstanding, all-around student.&quot; For three years, he received the Varsity Club scholarship &quot;for scholastic excellence, character and athletic ability.&quot; He graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1933 with a B.S. in economics.

== Track and field ==
At the University of Pennsylvania, Carr was coached by 1904 Olympian Lawson Robertson who called him &quot;the fastest Carr in America.&quot; In college, he never lost the 400-meter sprint. He also anchored the 1,600-meter relay team—which also never lost a competition during his college years. His favorite events became the long jump, the 440-meter, and the 800-meter.

He was the 1931 Amateur Athletic Union Indoor national champion in the 300-yards event. At the 1932 Intercollegiate Championships (IC4A) championships in Berkeley California, Carr beat world-record holder Ben Eastman in the 440-yard dash, winning the IC4A 440-yard title for 1932. His time was 47.0 seconds; Eastman&#x27;s record was 46.4 seconds. Carr was ranked number one in the world at the 400-meters.at the end of the 1932 season.

Several weeks later in Palo Alto, California, Carr again outran Eastman at the 1932 USA Outdoor Championships and 1932 United States Olympic trials (track and field). In addition to making the United States Olympic team, Carr was also a favorite for the 400-meter gold medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

On August 4, 1932 in Los Angeles Olympics, Carr placed first in his semi-final 400-meter heat with a time of 47.2 seconds, breaking Eric Liddell’s world record time of 47.6 seconds from the 1924 Summer Olympics. However, Eastman matched Liddell’s record in his semi-final heat, setting up a final Olympic race that &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the “400-meter race of the century.&quot; In the final, Eastman led during most of the race, but Carr emerged victorious in the last 100-meters with a time of 46.2 seconds. He had not only won a gold medal, but he also had set a world record. A few days later, Carr won another gold medal as the anchor of America&#x27;s 4 × 400-meter relay team. Although not scheduled to complete, he substituted for Arnold Adams who had to withdraw due to an injury. They set a new world record of 3:08.2.

Back at college in 1933, Carr had a &quot;lackluster&quot; performance in the spring season. On January 25, 1933, he announced that he would retire from track after the 1933 season. He said, &quot;I expect to be a member of the United States track and field team that will tour Europe next summer. When the team returns, my uniform and spiked shoes will be put away for good.&quot; He planned on retiring so that he could focus on a new career in business.

<doc id="774447" wikidata="Q506600" url="?curid=774447" title="Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein">
<text>Josef Wenzel I (Josef Wenzel Lorenz; 9 August 1696 – 10 February 1772), often referred to as just Wenzel, was the Prince of Liechtenstein between 1712 and 1718, and 1748 and 1772, as well as regent of Liechtenstein between 1732 and 1745. He first succeeded his distant cousin Hans-Adam I, even though he was not next in line. The actual heir was his uncle Anton Florian, who was not very popular among the family. Therefore Hans-Adam chose Josef Wenzel as his heir. He later decided to hand over the Principality in exchange for his getting the Dominion of Rumburk in 1718. Thirty years later he inherited Liechtenstein again after his nephew Prince Johann Nepomuk Karl died without male issue. As a military figure, Wenzel is known for his command of the Austrians at the Battle of Piacenza (War of the Austrian Succession).

==Biography==
Born in 1696 at Prague, Josef Wenzel was the eldest son of Prince Philipp Erasmus of Liechtenstein (11 September 1664 – 13 January 1704) and Countess Christina Theresa von Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rochefort (12 October 1665 – 14 April 1730). He was a great-grandnephew of Karl, the first Prince of Liechtenstein. In 1712, he succeeded his distant cousin Hans-Adam I, as the Prince of Liechtenstein, even though he was not next in line. The actual heir was his uncle Anton Florian, who was not very popular among the family. Hans-Adam therefore chose Josef Wenzel as his heir, but in 1718 the latter negotiated with Anton Florian and swapped the County of Vaduz and the Lordship of Schellenberg in exchange for the Dominion of Rumburk. He also married Anton Florian&#x27;s daughter Anna Maria Antonie, who was Wenzel&#x27;s cousin. A year later the two dominions were united into the new Principality of Liechtenstein, headed by Anton Florian.

Joseph Wenzel then enjoyed a long life of military successes. He was primarily a general and was a very successful campaigner. His first venture was in 1717, when he fought against the Ottoman Turks in the Austro-Turkish War, alongside famed military commander Prince Eugene of Savoy. He also participated in the War of Polish succession, once again alongside Prince Eugene. In 1745, he was made Generalissimo in Italy and was victorious the following year at the Battle of Piacenza. In 1753 he was made General Chief Commander in Hungary. In one of the greatest achievements of his career, he reorganised the Habsburg artillery, partially financed out of his own pocket. He was the 698th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in Austria. From 1735 to 1736, he was Imperial Envoy to Berlin and he was Imperial Ambassador to Paris between 1738 and 1741. In 1760, he escorted the future bride of Josef II to Vienna.

In 1732, Prince Josef Johann Adam, son and heir of the aforesaid Anton Florian, died and was succeeded by his son Johann Nepomuk Karl. However, the new Prince was only eight years old at the time, so Wenzel was established as his regent and guardian until he came of age in 1745. Johann Nepomuk did not live long however, dying only three years later in 1748. With no surviving male issue, the Principality passed back to Wenzel. He then went on to rule Liechtenstein until his death in 1772. With no surviving issue, Liechtenstein went to his nephew Franz Josef I.

==Legacy==

Though not one of the more well known Princes of Liechtenstein, Josef Wenzel I is still remembered for his military campaigns, as well as his patronage to the arts. When Hereditary Prince Alois&#x27;s eldest son was born in 1995, Alois decided to name him Josef Wenzel after this Prince.

==Marriage and issue==
On 19 April 1718 Josef Wenzel married his cousin, Princess Anna Maria Antonie of Liechtenstein (1699–1753), daughter of Anton Florian and Eleonore Barbara von Thun und Hohenstein, in 1718. They had five children, all of whom died in early childhood:
*Prince Philipp Anton (1 June 1719) died in infancy.
*Prince Philipp Ernst (5 June 1722 – 26 December 1723) died in early childhood
*Princess Maria Elisabeth (3 May 1724) died in infancy
*Princess Marie Alexandra (9 May 1727) died in infancy

Lynn was a professor emeritus of psychology at Ulster University, but had the title withdrawn by the university in 2018.

Many scientists criticised Lynn&#x27;s work for lacking scientific rigour, misrepresenting data, and for promoting a racialist political agenda. Lynn was associated with a network of academics and organisations that promote scientific racism. He had also advocated fringe positions regarding sexual differences in intelligence. In two books co-written with Tatu Vanhanen, Lynn and Vanhanen argued that differences in developmental indexes among various nations are partially caused by the average IQ of their citizens. Earl Hunt and Werner Wittmann (2008) questioned the validity of their research methods and the highly inconsistent quality of the available data points that Lynn and Vanhanen used in their analysis. Lynn also argued that a high fertility rate among individuals of low IQ constitutes a major threat to Western civilisation, as he believed people with low IQ scores will eventually outnumber high-IQ individuals. He argued in favour of anti-immigration and eugenics policies, provoking heavy criticism internationally. Lynn&#x27;s work was among the main sources cited in the book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, and he was one of 52 scientists who signed an opinion piece in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; entitled &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&quot;, which endorsed a number of the views presented in the book.

He was also on the board of the Pioneer Fund, which funds &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot; and has also been described as racist. He was on the editorial board of the journal &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot; until 2019.

==Early life and education==
Richard Lynn&#x27;s father was Sydney Cross Harland FRS (1891–1982), an agricultural botanist and geneticist, who had lived and worked in Trinidad and later Peru extensively, establishing himself as an expert in cotton genetics. Lynn&#x27;s mother Ann Freeman (1905–1964) was originally brought up in Trinidad and then educated at Bournemouth Girls&#x27; High School and Harrogate Ladies&#x27; College, and had moved back to the Caribbean to act as housekeeper for Harland. Harland was a close colleague of Ann Freeman&#x27;s father — the director of agriculture in the West Indies — but was still married to his first wife Emily. After a liaison in New York City between Harland and Freeman in 1929, his mother crossed the Atlantic to resettle near to her parents in Hampstead, where Lynn was born on 20 February 1930. In London and then Bristol, his mother raised him as a single parent during his childhood and adolescence. In 1949, after his father returned to Britain as professor of genetics at the University of Manchester, he met up with him roughly every year; Harland&#x27;s younger brother Bernard became a companion of Lynn&#x27;s mother, living together until their deaths in 1964.

Lynn was educated at Bristol Grammar School and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he received a Ph.D. in 1956.

==Career==
Lynn worked as lecturer in psychology at the University of Exeter and as professor of psychology at the Economic and Social Research Institute, Dublin, and at Ulster University.

In 1974, Lynn published a positive review of Raymond Cattell&#x27;s &quot;A New Morality from Science: Beyondism&quot;, in which he expressed the opinion that &quot;incompetent societies have to be allowed to go to the wall&quot; and that &quot;the foreign aid which we give to the under-developed world is a mistake, akin to keeping going incompetent species like the dinosaurs which are not fit for the competitive struggle for existence&quot;. In a 2011 interview, Lynn cited the work of Cattell, Francis Galton, Hans Eysenck and Cyril Burt as important influences.

==Work== 
===Publication on secular increases in IQ===
In 1982, Richard Lynn published a paper about the generational increase in performance on IQ tests, now known as the Flynn effect slightly before James Flynn&#x27;s publications documenting the same phenomenon. A few researchers have called the phenomenon the &quot;Lynn–Flynn effect&quot; as a way of recognizing both their contributions. In a 2013 paper, James Flynn offered his comments on this aspect of the effect&#x27;s naming:
===Dysgenics and eugenics===

In &quot;Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations&quot; (1996), Lynn reviewed the history of eugenics and dysgenics, from the early writings of Bénédict Morel and Francis Galton through the rise of eugenics in the early 20th century and its subsequent collapse. As a eugenicist himself, Lynn lists three concerns: deterioration in health, intelligence and conscientiousness. Lynn claims that, unlike modern societies, natural selection in pre-industrial societies favoured traits such as intelligence and &quot;character&quot;.

According to Lynn, those with greater educational achievement have fewer children, while children with lower IQs come from larger families. Lynn claimed that twin studies provide evidence of a genetic basis for these differences. Lynn proposes that conscientiousness is heritable, and that criminals tend to have more offspring. Lynn agreed with Lewis Terman&#x27;s comment in 1922 that &quot;children of successful and cultivated parents test higher than children from wretched and ignorant homes for the simple reason that their heredity is better&quot;.

A review of &quot;Dysgenics&quot; by evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton, published posthumously in 2000 in the &quot;Annals of Human Genetics&quot;, praised the book and its endorsement of eugenics, saying &quot;discussing the large bank of evidence that still accumulates on heritability of aptitudes and differentials of fertility, shows in this book that almost all of the worries of the early eugenicists were well-founded, in spite of the relative paucity of their evidence at the time&quot;.

Psychologist Nicholas Mackintosh, reviewing the book for the &quot;Journal of Biosocial Science&quot; in 2002, wrote that Lynn &quot;argues that the ideas of the eugenicists were correct and that we ignore them at our peril&quot;. Mackintosh criticised Lynn for &quot;not fully acknowledg[ing] the negative relationship between social class and education on the one hand, and infant mortality and life expectancy on the other&quot;. He questioned Lynn&#x27;s interpretation of data, and pointed out that according to Lynn&#x27;s reading of the theory of natural selection, &quot;if it is true that those with lower IQ and less education are producing more offspring, then they are fitter than those of higher IQ and more education&quot;. According to Mackintosh, eugenicist arguments such as Lynn&#x27;s are not based on a &quot;biological imperative, but rather on a particular set of value judgements&quot;.

In &quot;Eugenics: A Reassessment&quot; (2001), Lynn claimed that embryo selection as a form of standard reproductive therapy would raise the average intelligence of the population by 15 IQ points in a single generation (p. 300). If couples produce a hundred embryos, he argues, the range in potential IQ would be around 15 points above and below the parents&#x27; IQ. Lynn argues that this gain could be repeated each generation, eventually stabilising the population&#x27;s IQ at a theoretical maximum of around 200 after six or seven generations.

===Race and national differences in intelligence===
In the late 1970s, Lynn wrote that he found the average IQ of the Japanese to be 106.6, and that of Chinese people living in Singapore to be 110. Lynn&#x27;s psychometric studies were cited in the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; and were criticised as part of the controversy surrounding that book. In his 2002 article, &quot;Skin color and intelligence in African Americans&quot;, published in 2002 in &quot;Population and Environment&quot;, Lynn concluded that lightness of skin color in African Americans is positively correlated with IQ, which he claims derives from the higher proportion of Caucasian admixture. However, Lynn failed to control for childhood environmental factors that are related to intelligence, and his research was criticised by a subsequent article published in the journal by Mark E. Hill. The article concluded that &quot;...[Lynn&#x27;s] bivariate association disappears once childhood environmental factors are considered&quot;. In his response to Hill, Lynn wrote that &quot;The conclusion that there is a true association between skin color and IQ is consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors are partly responsible for the black–white difference in intelligence... the evidence that a statistically significant correlation is present confirms the genetic hypothesis&quot;. This statement was described by Marcus Feldman as &quot;nonsensical&quot;.

In 2010 Earl B. Hunt summarized Lynn&#x27;s research in this area along with that of Tatu Vanhanen, that he is &quot;highly critical of their empirical work, and even more so of their interpretations&quot;, but that they &quot;do deserve credit for raising important questions in a way that has resulted in interesting and important findings&quot;.

Lynn proposed the &quot;cold winters theory&quot; of the evolution of human intelligence, which postulates that intelligence evolved to greater degrees as an evolutionary adaptation to colder environments. According to this theory, cold environments produce a selective pressure for higher intelligence because they present cognitive demands not found in warmer environments, such as the need to find ways of keeping warm, and the stockpiling of food for winter. James Flynn has criticized this theory as being inconsistent with the global distribution of IQ scores. If the theory were correct, the people of Singapore, who originated primarily from China&#x27;s southern Guangdong province, would possess a lower average IQ than the people of mainland China, when in fact the reverse is true. In 2012 Scott A. McGreal, writing for &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, described it as a just-so story, saying the theory fails to account for challenges specific to warmer environments, and also does not explain why hominids who evolved for millions of years in colder environments (such as Neanderthals and &quot;Homo erectus&quot;) did not also evolve similar intelligence.

In &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; (2002), Lynn and Vanhanen argued that differences in nations&#x27; per capita gross domestic product (GDP) are partially caused by IQ differences, meaning that certain nations are wealthier in part, &quot;because&quot; their citizens are more intelligent. K. Richardson wrote in the journal &quot;Heredity&quot; that &quot;an association between IQ and national wealth is hardly surprising, though its causal direction is the opposite of that assumed by L&amp;V. But I would not take the &#x27;evidence&#x27; presented in this book to serve arguments either way.&quot; Other economists who reviewed the book also pointed to numerous flaws throughout the study, from unreliable IQ statistics for 81 of the 185 countries used in the analysis, to insecure estimates of the national IQ in the remaining 101 countries in the sample that did not have published IQ data. This was in addition to the highly unreliable GDP estimates for present-day developing countries and the even more unreliable historical data estimating GDP and national IQ dating back to the early 19th century, well before either concept even existed. Even the data on the 81 countries where direct evidence of IQ scores were actually available were highly problematic. For example, the data sets containing Surinamese, Ethiopian, and Mexican IQ scores were based on unrepresentative samples of children who had emigrated from their nation of birth to the Netherlands, Israel, and Argentina, respectively. In a book review for the &quot;Journal of Economic Literature&quot;, economist Thomas Nechyba wrote: &quot;Such sweeping conclusions based on relatively weak statistical evidence and dubious presumptions seem misguided at best and quite dangerous if taken seriously. It is therefore difficult to find much to recommend in this book.&quot;

Lynn&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Race Differences in Intelligence&quot; organises data on intelligence into ten population groups and (in the 2015 edition) covers over 500 published articles..

Lynn&#x27;s meta-analysis lists the average IQ scores of East Asians (105), Europeans (99), the Inuit (91), Southeast Asians and indigenous peoples of the Americas each (87), Pacific Islanders (85), Middle Easterners, South Asians and North Africans each (84), East and West Africans (67), Australian Aborigines (62) and Bushmen and Pygmies (54).

Lynn has previously argued that nutrition is the best-supported environmental explanation for variation in the lower range, and a number of other environmental explanations have been advanced. In his 2011 book &quot;The Chosen People&quot;, Lynn offers largely genetic explanations for Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence (generally estimated at 107–115 IQ).

===Sex differences in intelligence===
Observing a correlation between brain size and measured IQ, Lynn postulated that men and women may have brains that are different in size in proportion with differences in body size. In 1994, Lynn formulated a &quot;developmental theory&quot; of sex differences in intelligence, postulating that girls would have a developmental advantage over boys at the ages of 9 to 14, but that boys would continue to develop and increase in mean IQ relative to girls from the age of 15 onwards. In 2004, Lynn and Irwing conducted a meta-analysis of 57 studies from 14 countries, reporting a male advantage in IQ (measured via Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices) that begins to appear at the age of 15, eventually reaching an average of 5 IQ points at the ages of 20-29 and onwards.

In a 2006 study of Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test results in 5-17 year olds, Johannes Rojahn and Jack Naglieri reported findings that demonstrate a female advantage in the 10-13 age group and a male advantage in 15- and 16-year-olds. However, the authors conclude that the disparities were smaller than predicted by Lynn and too small to be of practical importance.

In 2008, Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlates highest with &quot;g&quot; factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt et al. (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity, thus contradicting the position put forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008). Roberto Colom and Paul M. Thompson, writing in &quot;The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Individual Differences&quot;, conclude based on the findings of Schmidt et al. and others that &quot;there is no sex difference in working memory capacity&quot;. 

=== Intranational intelligence variations ===
In a 2005 article, Lynn reported that Mexicans of European descent had an IQ of 98, Mestizos in Mexico had an IQ of 94, and indigenous peoples of Mexico had an IQ of 83, explaining the lower-than-expected IQ of Indians on their poor nutrition and other social factors.

In a 2010 article about IQ in Italy, Lynn contended that IQs are highest in the north (103 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and lowest in the south (89 in Sicily) and are correlated with average incomes, stature, infant mortality, literacy and education. The lack of any actual IQ test data (as Lynn used PISA score data) among other methodological issues and Lynn&#x27;s consequent conclusions were criticised.
Other large surveys in Italy have found much smaller differences in educational achievement. Several subsequent studies based on the direct assessment of IQs failed to report significant differences among Italian regions. On the contrary, the results from the Southern half of the country (103) are sometimes higher than those from the North Central regions (100–101).

In 2012 Lynn similarly claimed that southern Spaniards have lower IQs than northern Spaniards do and believes that this is because of Middle Eastern and North African genes in the South.

In a 2015 article published in &quot;Intelligence&quot; about the regional IQ differences in Turkey, Lynn, Sakar and Cheng analysed the PISA scores of NUTS-1 regions of the country and calculated the average IQ scores of said provinces, claiming there being a high correlation (r= .91) between the two metrics. The team took the average PISA score of UK as baseline to represent an IQ of 100. The paper concluded that the NUTS regions with the highest IQ average were West Marmara (97.7), East Marmara (97.4) and Central Anatolia (97.3), meanwhile the regions with the lowest scores were made up by Central East Anatolia (87.3) and Southeast Anatolia (86.3), respectively. The article suggested multiple theories to explain regional IQ disparity, such as historical migration to wealthier Western coastal areas having a eugenic effect on intelligence, or economic growth being inhibited by the mountainous terrain in the East, causing a negative effect on IQ. The paper compared the results of the study to those of Italy and US, citing a gross regional variation.

===&quot;The Global Bell Curve&quot;, 2008===
The Global Bell Curve: Race, IQ and Inequality Worldwide is a book by Lynn, originally published Washington Summit Publishers in 2008. The book&#x27;s stated purpose is to determine whether the racial and socioeconomic differences in the United States in average IQ, as originally claimed by the 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, also exist in other countries. Lynn&#x27;s book claims that such differences exist in other countries, in addition to in the United States. It was reviewed favorably by researchers J. Philippe Rushton, Donald Templer in white nationalist publication &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;, and Gerhard Meisenberg.

A less favorable review of the book was written by Wendy Johnson of the University of Edinburgh, who wrote in &quot;Intelligence&quot;, which had Lynn on its editorial board, that &quot;...despite many possible statistical and psychometric quibbles, the data Lynn presents in this book are essentially correct. At the same time, despite Lynn&#x27;s protestations to the contrary, these data do little or nothing to address the questions of why this is the case or whether the situation is inevitable or permanent. Like the other theorists he criticizes, Lynn confuses correlation with causation.&quot;

==Pioneer Fund==

Lynn served on the board of directors of the Pioneer Fund and was also on the editorial board of the Pioneer-supported journal &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, both of which have been the subject of controversy for their dealing with race and intelligence and eugenics and have been accused of racism, e.g., by Avner Falk and William Tucker. Lynn&#x27;s Ulster Institute for Social Research received $609,000 in grants from the Pioneer Fund between 1971 and 1996.

Lynn&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;The Science of Human Diversity: A History of the Pioneer Fund&quot; is a history and defence of the fund, in which he argues that, for the last 60 years, it has been &quot;nearly the only non-profit foundation making grants for study and research into individual and group differences and the hereditary basis of human nature ... Over those 60 years, the research funded by Pioneer has helped change the face of social science.&quot;

==Reception==
Lynn&#x27;s review work on global racial differences in cognitive ability has been cited for misrepresenting the research of other scientists and has been criticised for unsystematic methodology and distortion.

In 1994, Charles Lane criticised Lynn&#x27;s methodology in his article in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Tainted Sources of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;&quot; (1994). Pioneer Fund president Harry Weyher, Jr. published a response accusing the reviewer of errors and misrepresentation; Lane also replied to this with a rebuttal.

In 1995 psychologist Leon Kamin faulted Lynn in a critical review of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, for &quot;disregarding scientific objectivity&quot;, &quot;misrepresenting data&quot;, and for &quot;racism&quot;. Kamin argues that the studies of cognitive ability of Africans in Lynn&#x27;s meta-analysis cited by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray show strong cultural bias. Kamin also reproached Lynn for concocting IQ values from test scores that have no correlation to IQ. Kamin also noted that Lynn excluded a study that found no difference in white and black performance, and ignored the results of a study which showed black scores were higher than white scores.

In 2002, David King, the coordinator of the consumer watchdog group Human Genetics Alert, said: &quot;we find Richard Lynn&#x27;s claims that some human beings are inherently superior to others repugnant&quot;. In 2003, Gavin Evans wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Lynn was one of a number of &quot;flat-earthers&quot; who have claimed that &quot;Africans, or black Americans, or poor people&quot; are less intelligent than Westerners. He further wrote, with regard to Lynn&#x27;s claims that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners, &quot;What is remarkable in all this is not so much that there are people who believe him – after all, there are still those who insist the Earth is flat – but rather that any creditable institution should take it seriously.&quot;

The datum that Lynn and Vanhanen used for the lowest IQ estimate, Equatorial Guinea, was taken from a group of children in a home for developmentally disabled children in Spain. Corrections were applied to adjust for differences in IQ cohorts (the &quot;Flynn&quot; effect) on the assumption that the same correction could be applied internationally, without regard to the cultural or economic development level of the country involved. While there appears to be rather little evidence on cohort effect upon IQ across the developing countries, one study in Kenya (Daley, Whaley, Sigman, Espinosa, &amp; Neumann, 2003) shows a substantially larger cohort effect than is reported for developed countries.

In 2002 an academic dispute arose after Lynn claimed that some races are inherently more psychopathic than others, and other psychologists criticised his data and interpretations. Kamin said that &quot;Lynn&#x27;s distortions and misrepresentations of the data constitute a truly venomous racism, combined with the scandalous disregard for scientific objectivity&quot;.

In 2006, John P. Jackson Jr., of the University of Colorado, Boulder, disputed Lynn&#x27;s claim in &quot;The Science of Human Diversity&quot; that the Pioneer Fund was dedicated to funding objective scientific research. Jackson wrote that &quot;... although the Pioneer Fund may not have endorsed any policy proposal officially, it has funded a group that is remarkably uniform in its opposition to school integration, immigration, and affirmative action&quot;.
In 2010, on his 80th birthday, Lynn was celebrated with a special issue of &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot; dedicated to his work that was edited by Danish psychologist Helmuth Nyborg with contributions by Nyborg, J. Philippe Rushton, Satoshi Kanazawa and several others.
In February 2018, the Ulster University students&#x27; union issued a motion calling for the university to revoke Lynn&#x27;s title as emeritus professor. The motion argued that Lynn&#x27;s title should be revoked because he has made statements that are &quot;racist and sexist in nature&quot;. The university agreed to this request in April 2018.

== Allegations of racism ==
Lynn is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in their extremist files as a white nationalist. The SPLC has kept a record of Lynn&#x27;s controversial statements: for example, in a 2011 interview with then far-right artist Alex Kurtagić, Lynn stated: &quot;I am deeply pessimistic about the future of the European peoples because mass immigration of third world peoples will lead to these becoming majorities in the United States and westernmost Europe during the present century. I think this will mean the destruction of European civilization in these countries.&quot; In 1995, Lynn was quoted by the media watchdog group Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) saying: &quot;What is called for here is not genocide, the killing off of the population of incompetent cultures. But we do need to think realistically in terms of the &#x27;phasing out&#x27; of such peoples ... Evolutionary progress means the extinction of the less competent. To think otherwise is mere sentimentality.&quot;

FAIR also quoted Lynn as having stated in an interview with the right-wing British political magazine &quot;Right NOW!&quot;:
The SPLC stated that &quot;for 50 years, Richard Lynn has been at the forefront of scientific racism&quot;, that &quot;he argues that the nations with the highest IQs must subjugate or eliminate the lower-IQ groups within their borders in order to preserve their dominance&quot;, and summarizes his career thus:

The centre has also stated that &quot;Lynn uses his authority as [former] professor (emeritus) of psychology at the University of Ulster to argue for the genetic inferiority of non-white people.&quot;

Lynn was a frequent speaker at conferences hosted by the white-nationalist publication &quot;American Renaissance&quot;.

==Death==
On 23 July 2023, it was announced that Lynn had died. He was 93.

<text>Joseph of Cupertino (Copertino), OFM Conv. (; 17 June 1603 – 18 September 1663) was an Italian Conventual Franciscan friar who is honored as a Christian mystic and saint. According to traditional Franciscan accounts, he was &quot;remarkably unclever&quot;, but experienced miraculous levitation and ecstatic visions throughout his life which made him the object of scorn. He applied to the Conventual Franciscan friars, but was rejected due to his lack of education. He then pleaded with them to serve in their stables. After several years of working there, he had impressed the friars so much with the devotion and simplicity of his life that he was admitted to their Order, destined to become a Catholic priest, in 1625.

==Life==
He was born the son of Felice Desa and Frencesca Panaca in the village of Cupertino, in the Region of Apulia, then in the Kingdom of Naples, now in the Italian Province of Lecce. His father having died before his birth, however, the family home was seized to settle the large debts he had left, and his mother was forced to give birth to him in a stable.

Already as a child, Joseph began to experience ecstatic visions which were to continue throughout his life, and made him the object of scorn. His life was not helped by his frequent outbursts of anger. He was soon apprenticed by his uncle to a shoemaker. Feeling drawn to religious life, in 1620 he applied to the Conventual Franciscan friars, but was rejected due to his lack of education. He then applied to the Capuchin friars in Martino, near Taranto, by whom he was accepted in 1620 as a lay brother, but he was dismissed as his continued ecstasies made him unfit for the duties required of him.

After Joseph returned to the scorn of his family, he pleaded with the Conventual friars near Cupertino to be allowed to serve in their stables. After several years of working there, he had so impressed the friars with the devotion and simplicity of his life that he was admitted to their Order, destined to become a Catholic priest, in 1625. He was ordained a priest on 28 March 1628. He was then sent to the convent of Santa Maria della Grotella, just outside Cupertino, where he spent the next 15 years.

After this point it was claimed that he began to levitate while participating at the Mass or joining the community for the Divine Office, thereby gaining a widespread reputation of holiness among the people of the region and beyond. He was deemed disruptive by his religious superiors and church authorities, however, and eventually was confined to a small cell and forbidden to join in any public gathering of the community.

As the phenomenon of flying or levitation was widely believed to be connected with witchcraft, Joseph was denounced to the Inquisition. At their command, he was transferred from one Franciscan friary in the region to another for observation, first to Assisi (1639–1653), then briefly to Pietrarubbia and finally Fossombrone, where he lived with the Capuchin friars (1653–1657) and under their supervision. He practiced severe asceticism throughout his life, usually eating solid food only twice a week, and adding bitter powders to his meals. He passed 35 years of his life following this regimen.

Finally, on 9 July 1657, Joseph was allowed to return to a Conventual community, being sent to the one in Osimo, where he died shortly after.

Joseph was beatified in 1753. On 16 July 1767, he was canonized by Pope Clement XIII.

==Secular Reception==
Alleged eyewitness reports of Joseph&#x27;s levitations are speculated to be subject to gross exaggeration, and often written years after his death.

Robert D. Smith in his book &quot;Comparative Miracles&quot; (1965) suggested that Joseph performed feats similar to a gymnast. Smith noted that some of his alleged levitations &quot;originate from a leap, and not from a prone or simple standing or kneeling position, the witnesses mistook a leap of a very agile man for levitation.&quot;

Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell concluded that:

Joseph&#x27;s most dramatic aerial traverses were launched by a leap—not by a simple slow rising while merely standing or kneeling—but, moreover, I find that they appear to have continued as just the sudden arcing trajectories that would be expected from bounding. They were never circuitous or spiraling flights like a bird&#x27;s. Invariably, Joseph&#x27;s propulsions began with a shout or scream, suggesting that he was not caused to leap by some force but &quot;chose&quot; to.

Poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from ergot-infected grain was common in Europe in the Middle Ages. It was known to cause convulsion symptoms and hallucinations. British academic John Cornwell has suggested that Joseph had consumed rye bread (see ergot poisoning). According to Cornwell &quot;Here, perhaps, lay the key to his levitations. After sampling his own loaves he evidently believed he was taking off–as did those who partook of his high-octane bake-offs.&quot;

Contradicting this theory, Joseph was known for his ascetic lifestyle, abstaining from bread, wine, and meat, and subsisting primarily on fruits and herbs, making it unlikely that he would have consumed rye bread.

<text>Joseph Joubert (; 6 May 1754 in Montignac, Périgord – 4 May 1824 in Paris) was a French moralist and essayist, remembered today largely for his &quot;Pensées&quot; (&quot;Thoughts&quot;), which were published posthumously.

==Biography==
From the age of fourteen Joubert attended a religious college in Toulouse, where he later taught until 1776. In 1778 he went to Paris where he met D&#x27;Alembert and Diderot, amongst others, and later became a friend of a young writer and diplomat, Chateaubriand.

He alternated between living in Paris with his friends and life in the privacy of the countryside in Villeneuve-sur-Yonne. He was appointed inspector-general of universities under Napoleon.

Joubert published nothing during his lifetime, but he wrote a copious number of letters and filled sheets of paper and small notebooks with thoughts about the nature of human existence, literature, Christianity and spiritual life, and other topics, in a poignant, often aphoristic style. After his death his widow entrusted Chateaubriand with these notes, and in 1838, he published a selection titled, &quot;Recueil des pensées de M. Joubert&quot; (&quot;Collected Thoughts of Mr. Joubert&quot;). More complete editions were to follow, as were collections of Joubert&#x27;s correspondence.

Somewhat of the Epicurean school of philosophy, Joubert even valued his own frequent suffering of ill health, as he believed sickness gave subtlety to the soul. He belongs to the tradition of the so-called “French moralists.”

Joubert&#x27;s works have been translated into numerous languages. In 1866 were translated by George H. Calvert. A later English translation version was made by Paul Auster. 
Matthew Arnold in his &quot;Critical Essays&quot; devotes a section to Joubert.

<text>Luc Georges Marc Jean Jouret (; 18 October 1947 – 5 October 1994) was a Belgian doctor and homeopath. Jouret founded the Order of the Solar Temple (OTS) with Joseph Di Mambro in 1984. He committed suicide in the Swiss village of Salvan on 5 October 1994 as part of a mass murder–suicide. While DiMambro was the true leader of the group, Jouret was its outward image and primary recruiter.

Born in the Belgian Congo, Jouret was an athletic child, which he aimed to pursue in his later life. However following a period of sickness, he was unable to fulfill this goal, and instead he acquired a medical degree. Losing his faith in modern medicine due to his sickness, he shifted from normal medicine to homeopathy and other kinds of alternative medicine, on which he gave lectures alongside New Age topics. He was known as an excellent public speaker. In 1981, he met DiMambro, with whom he became close.

Jouret was the group&#x27;s public face, but in his role internal to the group, he was subservient to DiMambro. Following stressors within the group, including Jouret&#x27;s arrest for directing members to illegally buy silencers in Canada, he and DiMambro became increasingly paranoid, and the group&#x27;s ideological concept of &quot;transiting&quot; to another dimension would grow more prominent. Jouret, alongside another member, killed the 23 members in Cheiry. He then died from poisoning, alongside 24 other members in Salvan.

== Early life ==
Luc Georges Marc Jean Jouret was born on 18 October 1947 in Kikwit, in what was then the Belgian Congo. He was the second son of Napoléon and Fernande Jouret (born 1923, ), both Belgian. His father Napoléon Jouret had studied in Germanic languages and was a local government official in Belgium, while Fernande was a housewife.

After their first son was born in Belgium in 1946, Jouret&#x27;s parents moved to the Belgian Congo, where they settled in Kikwit; at the time, the colonial administration of the territory needed more civil servants, and Napoléon took up a job in territorial administration. Luc Jouret was born a year later; he was a sickly child, suffering from rickets, pulmonary issues, whooping cough, as well as nutritional issues in his early life. Due to the lack of medical equipment (and the climate) available in the Congo, the family returned to Belgium when he was 18 months old. By the age of three he had recovered under his mother&#x27;s care. Though he remained fragile in health, the family returned to the Congo and settled in Matadi where a third son was born in 1951. Napoléon switched careers into teaching Germanic languages to Belgian children, both black and white, and the family moved to Luluabourg. In 1954, when Jouret was six, he fractured his skull after being hit by a cyclist. His family, afraid for his life, returned to Dour, Belgium for good. A fourth child, a daughter, was born two years later.

As a teenager Jouret, now in better health, began to excel at sports, particularly judo and climbing. He aimed to become a teacher in physical education. In 1966, he enrolled in the prestigious Université libre de Bruxelles with a scholarship; his brother, also a student there, described him as a &quot;serious idealist&quot; at the time, not interested in money. Following May 68, communism was popular at the school, including with Jouret, noted to be more devoted to it than other students. One professor commented on an assessment that he &quot;would be an even better student if he studied less female students&quot;. Napoléon Jouret, then a school administrative manager, was an avid secularist and progressive critic of Belgian society. He created an organization opposing Catholic influence in Wallonia, of which he was president. At home however he was disciplinarian and occasionally physically abusive. Jouret&#x27;s older brother said that while he was not abused, he believed Jouret was. Jouret left home at about 21 years of age, under violent circumstances. A later patient of Jouret said that he had complained to him later in life of the lack of freedom and strictness of his upbringing. 

== Homeopathy and esotericism ==
At the age of 20, Jouret began to experience severe pain and was diagnosed with coxarthrosis (hip osteoarthritis), a diagnosis unusual for someone his age. As a result of this he spent 14 months mostly immobilized in bed and subject to constant medical care, an event which he described as making him lose his faith in modern medicine. Faced with the reality that he would no longer be able to become an athlete as he had wanted, Jouret was distraught.

Visiting students discussed with Jouret homeopathy and alternative medicine, and he set up an appointment with a homeopath. Jouret&#x27;s condition seemed to improve after a year, but he was still unable to achieve his previous aims, instead choosing to focus on medicine. As he could not regularly attend the classes due to his illness, he had to repeat the course, wasting two years of effort. Gradually Jouret&#x27;s condition began to improve, which he attributed to homeopathy, and he received his medical degree. Jouret became interested in a variety of alternative medicine, including iridology, macrobiotics, and acupuncture in addition to homeopathy. Jouret also became interested in politics, particularly Maoism, and joined the Union of Communist Students. Interested in both China&#x27;s history of traditional medicine and its communist politics, he decided to travel to China.

During his college years he joined the Walloon Communist Youth, which resulted in the police placing him under surveillance. He graduated with a medical degree in 1974. Two years after graduation, in 1976, he joined the Belgian Army, saying it was &quot;the best way to infiltrate the Army with Communist ideas&quot;, and became a paratrooper. While in the army he participated in the Battle of Kolwezi, a joint French and Belgian airborne operation which resulted in the liberation of hostages from the city of Kolwezi. For some time he practiced conventional medicine, before he began to practice homeopathy. Following his time in the army, he began a formal study of homeopathy and qualified as a homeopathic practitioner in France. He travelled widely studying various forms of alternative and spiritual healing; it is known that he visited the Philippines in 1977, and he later stated he had visited China, Peru, and India.

In 1977, both Jouret and his female companion Marie-Christine Pertué, a sophrologist four years his junior, became affiliated with the World Teacher Trust (WTT). The WTT, founded by Ekkirala Krishnamacharya, combined theosophical Master ideas with homeopathic ones. They both visited Krischnamacharya in India, and were important players in promoting the WTT in Europe (after meeting Di Mambro, Jouret disassociated from the WTT). In 1980, Jouret and Pertué married. As he married a French citizen he then became a French citizen in 1982. He established a homeopathic practice, initially in Belgium, starting in the late 1970s. At the beginning of the 1980s he settled in Annemasse, France, not far from the Swiss border, and began to practice homeopathy there, where he was very successful.
=== Meeting Di Mambro ===
Among the groups for which he lectured was the Golden Way Foundation, a New Age group in Geneva, Switzerland, and he became close friends with the foundation&#x27;s leader, Joseph Di Mambro. They met in late 1980. Jouret was immediately a favorite of Di Mambro; he encouraged his ambitions and exempted him from a member&#x27;s typical work. Soon after, he stopped contacting his family and largely abandoned his former friends. In one letter to a former friend, he wrote that he had &quot;changed his life&quot; and &quot;had a lot of work to do&quot; but that if he could he would see them again. According to a friend, Jouret deeply wished for other people to recognize him, which Di Mambro gave him (as well as money); in his view, Di Mambro had done to Jouret what he had done to everyone else. 

At the time he met Di Mambro, Jouret was having marital and personal problems. Pertué and Jouret had only recently gotten married, but they continued to argue; Jouret aggravated Pertué&#x27;s anorexic tendencies by policing her diet making sure she was vegetarian. In this period, she told him she was pregnant, to his elation. Jouret was extremely excited to be a father, and also saw it from an esoteric angle. Their son, Sébastien Jouret, was born in 1981. He was born with a serious heart defect, and was taken to the intensive care unit in the Brussels University Hospital. He died four days later. The funeral was conducted secretly with no one else invited, with Jouret leaving highly specific requirements for the funeral marker. A tornado later destroyed the cemetery his son was buried in, and the grave of Jouret&#x27;s son was the only marker left standing, while heavier markers were swept away. Di Mambro told Jouret that this experience was sent to him from above, so that he could understand his mission on earth in the cemetery. He later expressed to his friends that he was reassured by the fact that his son had died &quot;pure&quot;; he told another that he was relieved his son was dead because had he lived his life would have been limited due to the defect. Jouret became depressed following the death of his son, and Pertué would not recover; she abandoned her life plans, refused to eat and also began to believe that the child was not actually Jouret&#x27;s and was conceived without sexual intercourse.

In a letter in 1983, Jouret told their friends he and Pertué had mutually decided on a divorce, while in actuality Di Mambro had ordered they separate, portraying the couple as having a &quot;cosmic incompatibility&quot;. In a ceremony, Pertué was &quot;emptied&quot; of her &quot;spiritual content&quot;, and condemned to wander until the day she died; Jouret was advised not to contact her, however they did interact occasionally in the following years. Despite her harsh treatment by the group, she did not leave. Following their divorce, Pertué devoted herself to the group, developing anorexia, depression, and other mental health issues; Jouret, however, was told by Di Mambro that he was the reincarnation of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux – he viewed Jouret as too important for such a &quot;mediocre wife&quot;. Pertué and Jouret officially divorced in 1985. However, she told her family that she would continue to live with him. 

Di Mambro arranged for Jouret to meet Julien Origas, the founder of the Renewed Order of the Temple (ORT), who Di Mambro was close to. Jouret joined ORT in 1981. Jouret and Origas became quite close, and Origas may have appointed Jouret to be his successor. In 1983, after the death of Origas, Di Mambro urged Jouret to take over ORT, and he became its new grand master the same year. Within the year Origas&#x27;s daughter forced him out of the group over a dispute involving leadership and funds, resulting in a schism with half of ORT going with Jouret. Jouret then formed and lead a schismatic group of 30 ORT members, which opened branches in Martinique and Quebec. The same year, Michel Tabachnik was made president of the Golden Way Foundation. In 1984, Jouret and Di Mambro formed the International Chivalric Order of the Solar Tradition in Geneva, which would later become the Order of the Solar Temple. Jouret was the outward image and primary recruiter for this organization, though Di Mambro was the actual leader. However, according to former member Thierry Huguenin, inside the order Jouret was simply like everyone else having a job to do; he was the &quot;Grand Master&quot;, but Di Mambro was the &quot;secret master&quot; unknown to the public.

In 1984, Jouret was ordained as a priest by Jean Laborie, a &quot;self-proclaimed bishop&quot; and dissident Roman Catholic. Laborie had been contacted by Jouret, asking him to be ordained. Laborie, appreciative of someone willing to follow in his footsteps, which was rare, agreed to this quickly. To make the ceremony more original, Jouret suggested they hold it in an actual chapel, which Laborie appreciated. Laborie still had some concerns, to which Jouret blatantly lied and suggested his motivation to become a priest was a desire to evangelize, and after becoming one he would move to Africa to preach the word of Laborie&#x27;s church; his actual motive was to obtain more power over the group, gaining the movement prestige. The ordination was done in the Château d&#x27;Auty in January 1984. He also ordained Thierry Huguenin, another member alongside Jouret, and two other members. This was controversial following the suicides; Laborie argued that Jouret, along with the three other men he had ordained, had true faith and seemed very sympathetic.

By this time Jouret was traveling widely through French-speaking Europe, Eastern Canada and Martinique as an inspirational speaker. He traveled a wide conference and lecture circuit in hotels and universities in several countries. His specific presentations included ones titled: &quot;Old Age: The Doorway to Eternal Youth&quot;, &quot;Love and Biology&quot;, and &quot;Christ, the Sphinx, and the New Man&quot;. Jouret was a popular lecturer to Francophone audiences in both North America and Europe, with one commentator describing him as &quot;something of a phenomenon&quot;. His publications and lecture recordings were sold in several New Age bookstores and health food shops. He lectured to the public from a homeopathic and New Age persona, providing a path to the secret society beneath – usually, at least some who attended his lectures were interested. Jouret was known as an excellent speaker, and according to former member Hermann Delorme:

As part of a larger investigation into new religious movements in Switzerland in the late 80s, religious historian Jean-François Mayer attended one of his conferences. There were about 500 or 700 people at the conference he first attended, which he found surprising. After the lecture, pamphlets were distributed and attendees were told that if they wished to know more they could file an application, where they were then invited to another lecture to learn more about the group. At this lecture, less than 10 people expressed interest and by several months later only one person out of the group had joined the OTS.

=== Apocalypse predictions ===
Jouret spent much time in Martinique, starting in 1984. The OTS had more than 100 members there, mostly inherited from ORT&#x27;s branch. At the head of the Martinique branch was Pierre Celtan, who in his decision making would always refer to Jouret (himself always referring to Di Mambro); he was described as &quot;seduced&quot; by Jouret. Jouret began to give more Amenta Club conferences there, to hundreds of listeners, the wealthiest of whom were drawn into the group. While never publicly denigrating the beliefs of the Martinicans, knowing he had to take into account their beliefs in order to appeal to them, Jouret expressed his annoyance with the Martinicans to a friend, Claude Giron. He told Giron that while he tried to be comfortable with all the races, &quot;it must be recognized that they have different abilities&quot;. Jouret was noted to act &quot;haughty, distant, or frankly contemptuous&quot; to black members of the Solar Temple in Martinique, while accepting the whites.

Within a few months, he convinced the members in Martinique that they needed a new sanctuary, which he invited them to contribute to buying. In 1986, he told the Martinicans that the island would sink into the ocean by the end of the year. The members were terrified, but Jouret gave them a solution, which was to move to the group&#x27;s Canadian base, which he said would be protected due to it sitting upon a large granite plate with a strong magnetic field. Jouret predicted that Quebec would be spared from the apocalypse. He told the Martinican members that if they did not move to Quebec, they would die; 30 members took up this offer, selling their houses and leaving the spouses and children who did not want to go along. Jouret advised them to not pay taxes and borrow huge amounts of money, used to fund the new location in Quebec, as after they died it would not matter. After the new year rolled around and Martinique still existed, members wondered if he could have made a mistake. He assured them that it was merely a &quot;remission&quot;, but that the apocalypse would soon come and it was more important than ever to maintain the location in Canada.

Following the 1988 Saguenay earthquake, the view held by Jouret and other Templars that Quebec would be a safe haven from the impending apocalypse was damaged, which was the main reason they had moved to Canada. Members of the Sacred Heart commune began to criticize his leadership and his predictions (viewing them as too specific). The farm was also not self-sustaining, and the commune was close to bankruptcy. The members of the Sacred Heart commune disliked Jouret, accusing him of a lack of financial transparency and sexual exploitation of women. He was viewed as a dictator by the Quebec members of the group, and was also not present often as he constantly traveled. There was a resulting power struggle between the Quebec and Swiss templars. Canadian members began to question him, and Jouret was replaced as the Grand Master of the Sacred Heart commune by Robert Falardeau in about 1990. The Archedia clubs were dissolved in 1991, and at about the same time New Age bookstores in Europe began refusing to host Jouret and his conferences. 

However, Jouret could still give conferences in Canada. Jouret founded a separate group, or ARCHS (a pun on the &quot;ark of survival&quot;), taking several loyal members with him. Hermann Delorme was made president of ARCHS, but this was actually a ceremonial role with little meaning. His close friend Jean-Pierre Vinet, a vice president in the Hydro-Québec company, helped him transition to a different role, lecturing for management; several officials of Hydro-Québec then joined ARCHS. Jouret, having given up his profession as a homeopath to devote himself fully to the OTS, began lecturing on personal development at various companies, universities and banks, mainly in Quebec. Di Mambro, who had a dim view of these lectures as &quot;disseminating the ideas and principles of the OTS to the public&quot;, began sabotaging the lectures. Jouret eventually abandoned his activities and became totally dependent on Di Mambro. He slowly became less prominent in the leadership role of the Solar Temple and quit its executive committee in January 1993.

== Legal issues ==
Members in Martinique were beginning to be frustrated with Jouret, viewing him as a dictator who was controlling and intruded unnecessarily into their private lives. In 1990, Michel Branchi, a member of the Martinican Communist Party and correspondent for the Martinican branch of the anti-cult group ADFI, who happened to have a relative in the OTS, organized a meeting between the families of members and Jouret in order to &quot;attack&quot; him. Questioned by their relatives about, among other things, why couldn&#x27;t they see their relatives and what the money was used for, Jouret refused to answer and invoked his rank in the group, wishing for respect. A relative of one member insulted him, and Branchi said that if he did not leave Martinique they would take the &quot;necessary measures&quot;. At the same time, other Templar movements in Martinique were threatening his livelihood; he returned to Canada. 

This incident deeply affected the group. Jouret was terrified, and expressed to a friend that he had no choice but to leave in light of the threats he had received. He asked Giron to add to the group&#x27;s survival kits iodine, to help them survive a nuclear explosion. Giron expressed to Jouret that his &quot;trap&quot; was &quot;money and women&quot;. Every summer solstice Jouret sent all the members a message; in the message in 1991, Jouret instead sent an &quot;indecipherable cosmic jumble&quot;, invoking a variety of esoteric elements. Journalist Arnaud Bédat described this letter as &quot;[emptying] the store of Templar horrors.&quot; 

In March 1993, two members of the OTS – Jean Pierre Vinet and Hermann Delorme – were arrested for attempting to purchase three semiautomatic guns with silencers, which are illegal in Canada; this came after Jouret had encouraged them to buy the weapons. A warrant for Jouret&#x27;s arrest was issued, which could not be carried out as he was in Europe, and the Canadian press&#x27;s attention was drawn to the OTS. He was caught on a police wiretap saying:

Vinet and Delorme appeared in court on the charge of trafficking prohibited weapons on 30 June 1993. Jouret appeared 15 July, on the grounds of arms trafficking and conspiracy. He pleaded guilty, but obtained conditional discharge at his request, which kept his criminal record clean and allowed him to keep practicing medicine. The judge believed that the weapons purchases had been made in a &quot;defensive context&quot;, and that the individuals involved had already been punished by the media coverage. Jouret and the other two men were given only a light and symbolic sentence after the crime: one year of unsupervised probation and a $1000 fine intended to be paid to the Red Cross. Jouret was silent during the trial, and immediately returned to Switzerland, having spent less than 24 hours in Quebec. In the aftermath the media took interest in the group; the Canadian press began to report, using information gained from police wiretaps, conversations between members of the OTS, which they described as a &quot;doomsday cult&quot;. 

Following the gun scandal, Jouret became very paranoid and concerned with purported injustice, as well as the legal investigation he faced in several countries. Delorme never spoke to him again after the incident, but Vinet told him that Jouret was &quot;changed&quot; and that he became a &quot;tired, tired, tired, disappointed, disillusioned person&quot;. He began speaking of the &quot;transit&quot; concept previously established by Di Mambro. His physical condition began to deteriorate, and he did not sleep; instead, he spent the nights reading comic books. According to a former member, he constantly repeated that he was &quot;sick of it&quot; and that they had to &quot;stop it&quot;. In June 1994, he called his mother and tell her that, if anything happened to him, to not worry, as he had already done a lot in his life. His mother was extremely worried about him due to his obsession with the apocalypse and his pessimistic outlook. The next month he called a former friend who had recently become slightly distanced from the group; Jouret begged him to meet up. According to this friend, Jouret was anxious and felt threatened, but would not say why.

== Mass suicide ==

Di Mambro wrote four letters, known as &quot;The Testament&quot;, which contained messages of the order&#x27;s beliefs. In these letters, the OTS termed the acts a &quot;transit&quot;, which they described as &quot;in no way a suicide in the human sense of the term&quot;. They declared that, upon death, they would acquire &quot;solar bodies&quot; on the star Sirius (though members also gave Jupiter or Venus as an alternative destination). The letters maintain a persecuted rhetoric, largely devoted to complaining about the treatment faced by Vinet and Jouret in Canada. In one letter, they harshly criticize the allegations the OTS had received in several countries as &quot;deceitful&quot;, but especially complain about the SQ and the Q-37 investigation. 

On 30 September, Di Mambro had a meal with some followers near Montreux in Switzerland; according to an attendee (Vuarnet) Di Mambro had asked him to meet them, including Jouret and Pilet. They were joined shortly after by Daniel Jaton, who went off to speak with Jouret. The next day, Jouret was in Salvan, where records and eyewitness testimony place him on the phone, and was seen late in the day at a restaurant with others. 

During the night from 2 to 3 October 1994, 23 died in Cheiry, shot to death. The ones who had killed the others in Cheiry were Joël Egger and Jouret, though it is possible they were not the only ones. Following the deaths in Cheiry, Jouret was recorded as calling Di Mambro, possibly to inform him that it had been a success, and shortly after so did Egger. At about 6 a.m. Jouret left Cheiry for Salvan. Pertué had been invited to Cheiry; several of the dead in Cheiry had been killed as &quot;traitors&quot; to the movement. Hall and Schyuler noted she may have been killed for more &quot;personal&quot; reasons; she was killed with two bullets to the head.

In a final, fifth note, Jouret was blamed for the group&#x27;s actions in Cheiry. A note was found in Di Mambro&#x27;s chalet, which read:

25 were found dead in Granges-sur-Salvan. Most of the bodies in Salvan were burned beyond recognition, and Jouret and Di Mambro&#x27;s bodies had to be identified via dental records. The dead at Salvan had been injected with poison. According to the investigative report, it is likely that the fatal injections at Salvan were done by Line Lheureux. According to the coroner report, Jouret died of the drugs he ingested prior to the fire. His body was found in the second chalet in Salvan, having fallen on a beam from the intermediate floor.

Following the deaths, it was not immediately realized that Jouret was among the dead. The investigating judge issued a warrant for his arrest, but within a week it was found that he, along with all the main suspects in the deaths, were dead. Mostly in an attempt to discourage devoted former members from visiting their graves, the location of the graves of Jouret and Di Mambro were not officially released, with authorities describing it as &quot;top secret&quot;. As neither of their families came to claim their bodies, they were both cremated following their autopsies. According to the three journalists According to journalist Arnaud Bédat, who investigated the case, as the canton where the death occurred has jurisdiction in Switzerland, they were both buried secretly under an unmarked slab in a cemetery in Sion, Switzerland.

The Solar Temple disbanded after Di Mambro and Jouret&#x27;s deaths, though in 1995 another group of 16 OTS members committed suicide and in 1997 five more followed, following the first group.

<doc id="774458" wikidata="Q1385229" url="?curid=774458" title="Metaheuristic">
<text>In computer science and mathematical optimization, a metaheuristic is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, tune, or select a heuristic (partial search algorithm) that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem or a machine learning problem, especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity. Metaheuristics sample a subset of solutions which is otherwise too large to be completely enumerated or otherwise explored. Metaheuristics may make relatively few assumptions about the optimization problem being solved and so may be usable for a variety of problems. Their use is always of interest when exact or other (approximate) methods are not available or are not expedient, either because the calculation time is too long or because, for example, the solution provided is too imprecise.

Compared to optimization algorithms and iterative methods, metaheuristics do not guarantee that a globally optimal solution can be found on some class of problems. Many metaheuristics implement some form of stochastic optimization, so that the solution found is dependent on the set of random variables generated. In combinatorial optimization, there are many problems that belong to the class of NP-complete problems and thus can no longer be solved exactly in an acceptable time from a relatively low degree of complexity. Metaheuristics then often provide good solutions with less computational effort than approximation methods, iterative methods, or simple heuristics. This also applies in the field of continuous or mixed-integer optimization. As such, metaheuristics are useful approaches for optimization problems. Several books and survey papers have been published on the subject. Literature review on metaheuristic optimization, suggested that it was Fred Glover who coined the word metaheuristics.

Most literature on metaheuristics is experimental in nature, describing empirical results based on computer experiments with the algorithms. But some formal theoretical results are also available, often on convergence and the possibility of finding the global optimum. Also worth mentioning are the no-free-lunch theorems, which state that there can be no metaheuristic that is better than all others for any given problem.

Especially since the turn of the millennium, many metaheuristic methods have been published with claims of novelty and practical efficacy. While the field also features high-quality research, many of the more recent publications have been of poor quality; flaws include vagueness, lack of conceptual elaboration, poor experiments, and ignorance of previous literature.

==Properties==

These are properties that characterize most metaheuristics:

* Metaheuristics are strategies that guide the search process.
* The goal is to efficiently explore the search space in order to find optimal or near–optimal solutions.
* Techniques which constitute metaheuristic algorithms range from simple local search procedures to complex learning processes.
* Metaheuristic algorithms are approximate and usually non-deterministic.
* Metaheuristics are not problem-specific. However, they were often developed in relation to a problem class such as continuous or combinatorial optimization and then generalized later in some cases.
* They can draw on domain-specific knowledge in the form of heuristics that are controlled by a higher-level strategy of the metaheuristic.
* They can contain mechanisms that prevent them from getting stuck in certain areas of the search space.
* Modern metaheuristics often use the search history to control the search.

== Classification ==
There are a wide variety of metaheuristics and a number of properties with respect to which to classify them. The following list is therefore to be understood as an example.

=== Local search vs. global search ===
One approach is to characterize the type of search strategy. One type of search strategy is an improvement on simple local search algorithms. A well known local search algorithm is the hill climbing method which is used to find local optimums. However, hill climbing does not guarantee finding global optimum solutions.

Many metaheuristic ideas were proposed to improve local search heuristic in order to find better solutions. Such metaheuristics include simulated annealing, tabu search, iterated local search, variable neighborhood search, and GRASP. These metaheuristics can both be classified as local search-based or global search metaheuristics.

Other global search metaheuristic that are not local search-based are usually population-based metaheuristics. Such metaheuristics include ant colony optimization, evolutionary computation such as genetic algorithm or evolution strategies, particle swarm optimization, rider optimization algorithm and bacterial foraging algorithm.

=== Single-solution vs. population-based ===
Another classification dimension is single solution vs population-based searches. Single solution approaches focus on modifying and improving a single candidate solution; single solution metaheuristics include simulated annealing, iterated local search, variable neighborhood search, and guided local search. Population-based approaches maintain and improve multiple candidate solutions, often using population characteristics to guide the search; population based metaheuristics include evolutionary computation and particle swarm optimization. Another category of metaheuristics is Swarm intelligence which is a collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized agents in a population or swarm. Ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, social cognitive optimization and bacterial foraging algorithm are examples of this category.

=== Hybridization and memetic algorithms ===
A hybrid metaheuristic is one that combines a metaheuristic with other optimization approaches, such as algorithms from mathematical programming, constraint programming, and machine learning. Both components of a hybrid metaheuristic may run concurrently and exchange information to guide the search.

On the other hand, Memetic algorithms represent the synergy of evolutionary or any population-based approach with separate individual learning or local improvement procedures for problem search. An example of memetic algorithm is the use of a local search algorithm instead of or in addition to a basic mutation operator in evolutionary algorithms.

=== Parallel metaheuristics ===
A parallel metaheuristic is one that uses the techniques of parallel programming to run multiple metaheuristic searches in parallel; these may range from simple distributed schemes to concurrent search runs that interact to improve the overall solution. 

With population-based metaheuristics, the population itself can be parallelized by either processing each individual or group with a separate thread or the metaheuristic itself runs on one computer and the offspring are evaluated in a distributed manner per iteration. The latter is particularly useful if the computational effort for the evaluation is considerably greater than that for the generation of descendants. This is the case in many practical applications, especially in simulation-based calculations of solution quality.

=== Nature-inspired and metaphor-based metaheuristics ===

A very active area of research is the design of nature-inspired metaheuristics. Many recent metaheuristics, especially evolutionary computation-based algorithms, are inspired by natural systems. Nature acts as a source of concepts, mechanisms and principles for designing of artificial computing systems to deal with complex computational problems. Such metaheuristics include simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. 

A large number of more recent metaphor-inspired metaheuristics have started to attract criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor. As a result, a number of renowned scientists of the field have proposed a research agenda for the standardization of metaheuristics in order to make them more comparable, among other things. Another consequence is that the publication guidelines of a number of scientific journals have been adapted accordingly.

== Applications ==

Most metaheuristics are search methods and when using them, the evaluation function should be subject to greater demands than a mathematical optimization. Not only does the desired target state have to be formulated, but the evaluation should also reward improvements to a solution on the way to the target in order to support and accelerate the search process. The fitness functions of evolutionary or memetic algorithms can serve as an example. 

Metaheuristics are used for all types of optimization problems, ranging from continuous through mixed integer problems to combinatorial optimization or combinations thereof. In combinatorial optimization, an optimal solution is sought over a discrete search-space. An example problem is the travelling salesman problem where the search-space of candidate solutions grows faster than exponentially as the size of the problem increases, which makes an exhaustive search for the optimal solution infeasible. Additionally, multidimensional combinatorial problems, including most design problems in engineering such as form-finding and behavior-finding, suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which also makes them infeasible for exhaustive search or analytical methods. 

Metaheuristics are also frequently applied to scheduling problems. A typical representative of this combinatorial task class is job shop scheduling, which involves assigning the work steps of jobs to processing stations in such a way that all jobs are completed on time and altogether in the shortest possible time. In practice, restrictions often have to be observed, e.g. by limiting the permissible sequence of work steps of a job through predefined workflows and/or with regard to resource utilisation, e.g. in the form of smoothing the energy demand. Popular metaheuristics for combinatorial problems include genetic algorithms by Holland et al., scatter search and tabu search by Glover. 

Another large field of application are optimization tasks in continuous or mixed-integer search spaces. This includes, e.g., design optimization or various engineering tasks. An example of the mixture of combinatorial and continuous optimization is the planning of favourable motion paths for industrial robots.

== Metaheuristic Optimization Frameworks ==

A MOF can be defined as ‘‘a set of software tools that provide a correct and reusable implementation of a set of metaheuristics, and the basic mechanisms to accelerate the implementation of its partner subordinate heuristics (possibly including solution encodings and technique-specific operators), which are necessary to solve a particular problem instance using techniques provided’’.

There are many candidate optimization tools which can be considered as a MOF of varying feature. The following list of 33 MOFs is compared and evaluated in detail in: Comet, EvA2, evolvica, Evolutionary::Algorithm, GAPlayground, jaga, JCLEC, JGAP, jMetal, n-genes, Open Beagle, Opt4j, ParadisEO/EO, Pisa, Watchmaker, FOM, Hypercube, HotFrame, Templar, EasyLocal, iOpt, OptQuest, JDEAL, Optimization Algorithm Toolkit, HeuristicLab, MAFRA, Localizer, GALIB, DREAM, Discropt, MALLBA, MAGMA, and UOF. There have been a number of publications on the support of parallel implementations, which was missing in this comparative study, particularly from the late 10s onwards.

== Contributions ==
Many different metaheuristics are in existence and new variants are continually being proposed. Some of the most significant contributions to the field are:

* 1952: Robbins and Monro work on stochastic optimization methods.
* 1954: Barricelli carries out the first simulations of the evolution process and uses them on general optimization problems.
* 1963: Rastrigin proposes random search.
* 1965: Matyas proposes random optimization.
* 1965: Nelder and Mead propose a simplex heuristic, which was shown by Powell to converge to non-stationary points on some problems.
* 1965: Ingo Rechenberg discovers the first Evolution Strategies algorithm.
* 1966: Fogel et al. propose evolutionary programming.
* 1970: Hastings proposes the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.
* 1970: Cavicchio proposes adaptation of control parameters for an optimizer.
* 1970: Kernighan and Lin propose a graph partitioning method, related to variable-depth search and prohibition-based (tabu) search.
* 1975: Holland proposes the genetic algorithm.
* 1977: Glover proposes scatter search.
* 1978: Mercer and Sampson propose a metaplan for tuning an optimizer&#x27;s parameters by using another optimizer.
* 1980: Smith describes genetic programming.
* 1983: Kirkpatrick et al. propose simulated annealing.
* 1986: Glover proposes tabu search, first mention of the term &quot;metaheuristic&quot;.
* 1989: Moscato proposes memetic algorithms.
* 1990: Moscato and Fontanari, and Dueck and Scheuer, independently proposed a deterministic update rule for simulated annealing which accelerated the search. This led to the threshold accepting metaheuristic.
* 1992: Dorigo introduces ant colony optimization in his PhD thesis.
* 1995: Wolpert and Macready prove the no free lunch theorems.

<text>Harry Pratt Judson (December 20, 1849 – March 4, 1927) was an American educator and historian and the second president of the University of Chicago.

==Biography==
Judson was born at Jamestown, New York and educated at Williams College (A.B., 1870; A.M., 1883), where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Epsilon chapter). Judson taught at Troy High School in Troy, New York, from 1870 to 1885 and was professor of history and lecturer on pedagogics at the University of Minnesota from 1885 to 1892.

Moving to the University of Chicago in 1892, Judson became professor of political science and head dean of the colleges and in 1894 was named head of the department of political science and dean of the faculty of arts, literature, and science. He served as acting president of the University of Chicago from 1906 to 1907 and was named the university&#x27;s second president in 1907, serving until 1923. During his tenure, Judson forced Georgiana Simpson (the second Black woman to receive a PhD) to move off-campus after several white students complained about her presence in the dorms.

Judson became a member of the General Education Board in 1906 and of the Rockefeller Foundation in 1913.

==Publications==
Besides editing a series of readers, he is author of:
* &quot;History of the Troy Citizens&#x27; Corps&quot; (1884).
* &quot;Cæsar&#x27;s Army&quot; (1888).
* &quot;Europe in the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1894; third edition, revised, 1901). 
* &quot;The Growth of the American Nation&quot; (1895; second edition, 1900).
* &quot;The Higher Education as a Training for Business&quot; (1896; second edition, 1911).

<doc id="774475" wikidata="Q1976061" url="?curid=774475" title="Augustus D. Juilliard">
<text>Augustus D. Juilliard ( , ; April 19, 1836 – April 25, 1919) was an American businessman and philanthropist, born at sea as his parents were immigrating to the United States from France. Making a successful career in New York City, he bequeathed much of his estate to the advancement of music in the United States.

Trustees of his estate set up the Juilliard Foundation in 1920 to accomplish his goals, and in 1924 established the Juilliard School in New York City as a graduate music conservatory. Gradually programs were added in dance and theater.

==Biography==
The son of immigrants from the Burgundy region of France, Juilliard was born at sea while his parents were en route to the United States. His parents were Jean Nicolas Juilliard, a shoemaker, and Anna Burlette, who were both Huguenots. Augustus was raised near Louisville, Ohio, and attended local schools.

In 1866, Juilliard moved to New York City, where he worked in the garment industry for a textile manufacturing company that produced worsted fabrics. When the company went bankrupt seven years later, Juilliard founded his own corporation, the Augustus D. Juilliard Company, in 1874. The corporation distributed textiles including wool, silk, and cotton. In 1884, Juilliard was the plaintiff in the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot;, challenging the law requiring acceptance of federal reserve notes as legal currency; the challenge failed.

He became a successful and wealthy merchant, who added to his fortune through investments and board appointments in banking, railroad and insurance. He resided in Tuxedo Park, New York, where he owned a grand mansion, and also had an apartment on the West Side of Manhattan. A patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, he served as President of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly three decades, from 1892 until his death. Juilliard died in 1919, aged 83, at his home in New York City. He was interred in the family mausoleum at the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Personal life==
Juilliard married Helen Marcellus Cossitt in 1877. The couple did not have any children. His wife died in 1916.

Juilliard made bequests to hospitals, museums and other charitable causes, but the vast majority of his estate, $5 million (), was designated for the advancement of music in the United States. In 1920, the Juilliard Foundation was created.

In 1924, the Foundation&#x27;s funds were used by its Trustees to establish the Juilliard Graduate School to assist excelling students with an advanced music education. In 1926, the school was merged with the New York Institute of Musical Art. This music academy was established in 1905 by Dr. Frank Damrosch (godson of Franz Liszt) and was dedicated to providing a teaching level equaling that of the European conservatories.

<text>Félix Aguilar Observatory ( ; OAFA) is an astronomical observatory established in 1953, in San Juan Province, Argentina. In 1974, it was renamed to Carlos Ulrrico Cesco Astronomical Station ( ; EACUC).

Its primary observing facility is located in El Leoncito National Park in the west of San Juan Province. Also located in El Leoncito Park is the Leoncito Astronomical Complex. The observatory is operated by the School of Physical and Natural Sciences at the National University of San Juan in San Juan, Argentina. The original OAFA observatory buildings are located at the west end of the city.

OAFA is named after Félix Aguilar (1884–1943), an Argentine astronomer and engineer who was director of the La Plata Astronomical Observatory from 1919 to 1921, and again from 1934 until his death. EACUC was renamed after Carlos Ulrrico Cesco on the 25th anniversary of the beginning of observations in honour of his contributions to the founding and operation of the observatory.

The main-belt asteroid 3083 OAFA, was named after the discovery of the Felix Aguilar Observatory. The official naming citation was published on 21 November 1991 ().

== History ==

In 1947, research started at the Lick Observatory in California to study the Northern Milky Way&#x27;s structure by determining the accurate positions and apparent motions of stars. There was a need to extend that investigation to the Southern Hemisphere, and in 1960, Yale University obtained initial funding of 750 k$ for the purpose of building a southern observatory for that purpose from the Ford Foundation. Following a survey of potential sites, the observatory was built at El Leoncito, Argentina, near Barreal in the province of San Juan, in the eastern foothills of the Andes mountains at an elevation of approximately 2400 m (8000 ft). The site was provided under a long-term lease by the University of Cuyo and the observatory was jointly operated by the University of Cuyo&#x27;s Observatorio Astronómico &quot;Félix Aguilar&quot; (OAFA) in San Juan and the Yale-Columbia Southern Observatory, Inc (YCSO). A residence was constructed adjacent to the grounds of the OAFA in San Juan for the technical support and housing of the YCSO personnel while they were in San Juan.

The first survey of the Southern sky was made between the years 1965 and 1974, with the financial support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). During that period, the US Naval Observatory (USNO) relocated a meridian circle telescope to El Leoncito to extend their catalogue of stellar positions to the Southern Hemisphere. The USNO returned that telescope to Washington following the completion of its project in 1974. At about the same time, Columbia University withdrew from the YCSO corporation and it became the Yale Southern Observatory, Inc. on January 23, 1975.

About two years earlier, the University of Cuyo had split into several regionally based units. The one based in San Juan became known as the National University of San Juan (UNSJ) and it assumed the administration of the OAFA and partnership with the YCSO and then the YSO. In 1990 the El Leoncito Observatory was renamed The Dr. Carlos U. Cesco Observatory on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the beginning of observations, in honour of Dr. Cesco&#x27;s many contributions to the founding and operation of the Observatory.

During the period 1974-1983, El Leoncito was run by OAFA under the terms of an agreement signed by the OAFA and the YSO. In 1983, a new ten-year agreement was negotiated that allowed the Southern Sky survey to be repeated, and this was again extended for another ten-year period in 1993. Around 1987, Eastman Kodak terminated the production of the photographic plates used in the survey after only one-third of the second epoch photography had been completed; in 1997 a CCD detector system was installed on the telescope to replace the photographic plates.

== Telescopes ==

The principal telescope of EACUC is a double astrograph consisting of two lenses each 20-inches (50.8 cm) in diameter, one designed for blue light and the other for yellow light. The lenses focus the light separately onto two photographic plates with dimensions of 17×17 inches (43×43 cm). The photographic plates are purchased in the U.S., shipped to Argentina, exposed in the telescope, developed, and then shipped back to the U.S. In New Haven, Connecticut, the plates are measured with a precision measuring machine.

<text>Solomon Laurent Juneau, or Laurent-Salomon Juneau (August 9, 1793 – November 14, 1856) was a French Canadian fur trader, land speculator, and politician who helped found the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was born in Repentigny, Quebec, to François and (Marie-)Thérèse Galarneau Juneau. Joseph Juneau, the founder of the city of Juneau, Alaska, was a cousin of Solomon Juneau.

==Biography==
After landing at Fort Michilimackinac in 1816, Juneau worked as a clerk in the fur trade before becoming an agent for the American Fur Company in Milwaukee. He had been summoned to the Milwaukee area by Jacques Vieau, a French-Canadian fur trader and the first permanent white settler in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1818 Jacques Vieau hired Juneau, based on the accounting prowess Juneau had become known for, and his reputation for being able to deal well with the local native Americans. Juneau later married one of Vieau&#x27;s daughters, Josette, and went on to found what was to become the City of Milwaukee.

Juneau settled an area east of the Milwaukee River called Juneautown (present-day East Town) in 1818, which later joined with George H. Walker&#x27;s Walker&#x27;s Point and Byron Kilbourn&#x27;s Kilbourntown (present-day Westown) to incorporate the City of Milwaukee. With Juneau came his personal cook Joe Oliver, a Black Catholic believed to have been the first African American in Milwaukee history.

In 1831, Juneau began learning English and set in motion the naturalization and citizenship process. By 1835, he was selling plots of land in Juneautown. He built Milwaukee&#x27;s first store and first inn, and was recognized for his leadership among newcomers to Milwaukee. In 1837 he started the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;, which would become the oldest continuously operating business in Wisconsin. He was the first mayor of Milwaukee from 1846 until 1847, and was appointed its first postmaster. Solomon Juneau High School, built in 1932, is named after him. The school is located at 6415 West Mount Vernon Avenue in Milwaukee. The hour bell in the clock tower of the Milwaukee City Hall, installed in 1896, is also named after him.

===Personal life===
In 1820, Juneau married Josette Le-Vieux, the Métis daughter of Jacques Vieau, a fur trader for the North West Company who had built a trading post overlooking the Menomonee Valley years before, and his Menominee wife. Josette was the oldest of 12 children, and was Menominee and French by ancestry. Through her alliances to the tribe, and the relationships fostered through Juneau&#x27;s business in fur trading, it is reported that Juneau was popular with the Menominee. After the treaty of 1848 between the United States and the Menominee, he registered his wife and children as half-breeds of the Menominee Nation.

In 1854, Juneau and family relocated to Dodge County, Wisconsin, where they founded the village of Theresa, named after Juneau&#x27;s French-Canadian mother. Josette died there in 1855; Solomon died one year later in Keshena, Wisconsin, on a visit to the Menominee tribe. He died in the arms of Benjamin Hunkins, his &quot;faithful friend and constant nurse.&quot; Six Menominee chiefs served as pallbearers at his funeral. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Juneau&#x27;s grandson Paul O. Husting would be elected as a member of the United States Senate. The property that is believed to have once been the site of Juneau&#x27;s residence is now the site of the Mitchell Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Leslie John Comrie FRS (15 August 1893 – 11 December 1950) was an astronomer and a pioneer in mechanical computation.

==Life==
Leslie John Comrie was born in Pukekohe (south of Auckland), New Zealand, on 15 August 1893.
He attended Auckland University College (part of the University of New Zealand) from 1912 to 1916, graduating with BA and MA degrees with Honours in Chemistry. During World War I, despite severe deafness, he saw action in France with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, and lost his left leg in February 1918 to a British shell. While convalescing, he started using a mechanical calculator and went on to modify commercial calculators for specific projects.

Having joined while in school in New Zealand, Comrie was eventually the first director (1920–1922) of the Computing Section of the British Astronomical Association. In 1923 he received a PhD from St John&#x27;s College of the University of Cambridge. He travelled to the United States to teach at Swarthmore College and Northwestern University in 1924, where he also pioneered the teaching of numerical analysis. He returned to England to join the HM Nautical Almanac Office at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, where he became deputy superintendent in 1926.

His article &quot;On the Construction of Tables by Interpolation&quot; was published in April 1928, and described the use of punched card equipment for interpolating tables of data, in contrast to the more inefficient and error-prone methods involving mechanical devices like the pinwheel calculators under the &quot;Brunsviga&quot; brand name. In the same year, he became the first person to use punched card equipment for scientific calculations, by using Fourier synthesis to compute the principal terms in the motion of the Moon between 1935 and 2000 (improving upon the predictions of Ernest William Brown).
Wallace J. Eckert, an American student of Brown at Columbia University, would later use IBM&#x27;s vast computational resources to refine the predictions even further.

He was promoted to Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac Office in 1930. However, his unconventional use of machines for calculation caused tensions with his superiors, and he was suspended in August 1936.

Comrie founded in 1937 the world&#x27;s first private company for scientific computing, incorporated as Scientific Computing Service, Limited.
During World War II, he headed a team of 30 scientists to computerize war work, such as the creation of bombing tables for the Allies of World War II. He later used this technology to computerize British football pools.

After the war, Comrie visited the United States and New Zealand in 1948.
Comrie was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in March 1950.

Comrie is also remembered for his work in astronomy, as he published both scientific and popular articles on subjects ranging from predicting eclipses to the green flash. He died on 11 December 1950 at age 57, following a series of strokes. A lunar crater (23.3N 112.7W) and an asteroid, 3521 Comrie, bear his name, as does the computer lab at the University of Auckland, which was named on the 50th anniversary of his death.

==Geography==
Koprivnica (German: &quot;Kopreinitz&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Kapronca&quot;) is situated at a strategic location – on the slopes of Bilogora and Kalnik to the south and river Drava to the north. Its position enabled it to develop numerous amenities for the wider area such as trade, crafts and administration, and in the 13th century Koprivnica became a town settlement. Koprivnica was named after the stream of the same name, which was first mentioned at the beginning of the 13th century during the Hungarian Kingdom.

==Education==
===Universities===
Koprivnica and Varaždin took part in establishing the University North, a public national university that operates in both cities since 2015.

==History==
Koprivnica has a history similar to that of nearby Varaždin: it was first mentioned in 1272 in a document by prince László IV and declared a free royal town by king Lajos I in 1356, and flourished as a trading place and a military fortress since that time.

In the 14th century, the town settlement further developed due to increased trade under the influence of Varaždin. During the construction of Renaissance fortification in the second half of the 16th century Koprivnica was the centre of the Slavonian military border. Koprivnica counted among its troops musketeers, German soldiers, hussars and infantry. At that time the Renaissance square emerged together with the Town hall which emphasized its Renaissance identity, so Koprivnica can today be legitimately considered a renaissance town.

The military aspect set it back somewhat when it was included in the Military Frontier in the 16th century during the wars with the Ottoman Turks, but after Maria Theresia&#x27;s decree of 1765 it resumed life as a peaceful little merchant town which it was in reality.

Its position on the border of Habsburg monarchy and Ottoman Empire influenced the environment, economic, social and demographic changes, as well as everyday life. Koprivnica can therefore be considered a border town. In the second half of the 17th century Koprivnica was among the most developed royal towns in the Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom and its economic growth was initially based on strong trade activity. The fact that the three most significant churches (St. Nicholas, St. Anthony of Padua with the Franciscan monastery and church of the Assumption of Virgin Mary in Mocile further illustrates the economic power of the town in the 17th century. Economic activity was moved outside the town fortifications and this resulted in the wide and spacious baroque squares – today&#x27;s Zrinski square and Jelačić square. At the same time the oldest streets evolved and they established the development base for the town until the present day.

In the 19th century, the old Renaissance and Baroque housing and buildings associated with trade were replaced by the now historical architecture and the new town centre acquired its present appearance. In 1863, the main part of the future town park was planted, and the removal of the old fortification together with the construction of the railway determined the regional development of the town. Railway connections enabled the development of industry and further established Koprivnica as a leading centre of the Podravina region. The Koprivnica Synagogue was built in 1875 in the centre of Koprivnica. Today it is listed as a cultural monument.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Koprivnica was a district capital in the Bjelovar-Križevci County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. The first concentration and extermination camp established in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II was the Danica concentration camp established in Koprivnica.

Koprivnica developed significantly in the 20th century with the advent of the &quot;Podravka&quot; food industry, known worldwide for its Vegeta spice. They even have a museum devoted to the firm of Podravka.

The annual &quot;motifs of &quot;Podravina&quot;&quot; event is when the whole town becomes a gallery of naïve art. Many of the greatest Croatian naïve artists come from the villages along the Drava in this county, notably Ivan Generalić.

<text>Carlos Ulrrico Cesco (died 1987) was an Argentine astronomer. He lived most of his life in San Juan, Argentina. He was a well-known discoverer of minor planets credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of 19 numbered minor planets.

His older brother, Ronaldo P. Cesco, was a mathematician and celestial mechanician and director of the La Plata Observatory. They both studied at the Universidad de la Plata.

== Legacy ==

The &quot;Carlos Ulrico Cesco Observatory&quot; is named after him &quot;(formerly known as the Félix Aguilar Observatory)&quot;. 

The outer main-belt asteroid 1571 Cesco, discovered by Miguel Itzigsohn at La Plata Observatory in 1950, was named after Carlos and Ronaldo Cesco. The official naming citation was published by the MPC on 6 June 1982 ().

<text>The giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis), sometimes referred to as the large-antlered muntjac, is a species of muntjac deer. It is the largest muntjac species and was discovered in 1994 in Vũ Quang, Hà Tĩnh Province of Vietnam and in central Laos. During inundation of the Nakai Reservoir in Khammouane Province of Laos for the Nam Theun 2 Multi-Purpose Project, 38 giant muntjac were captured, studied, and released into the adjacent Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area. Subsequent radio-tracking of a sample of these animals showed the relocation was successful. The species is also located in parts of eastern Cambodia, as well as the Annamite Mountains (Trường Sơn Mountains).

The giant muntjac is commonly found in evergreen forests and weighs about . It has a red-brown coat and is an even-toed ungulate. Due to slash-and-burn agriculture, combined with hunting, the giant muntjac is considered critically endangered. It is preyed upon by animals such as the tiger and leopard. It is most closely related to &quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot; (common muntjac).

<text>Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo, composed of Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They achieved chart success with their singles &quot;At the River&quot;, &quot;I See You Baby&quot; and &quot;Superstylin&#x27;&quot;. The duo have released nine studio albums, four of which have charted in the UK Albums Chart top 50.

== History ==
Groove Armada formed after Cato and Findlay had been introduced by a mutual friend and soon started their own club night in London, called Captain Sensual at the Helm of the Groove Armada, after a 1970s discothèque.

By 1997, they had released a few singles, including &quot;4 Tune Cookie&quot; and the song that first brought them minor fame, &quot;At the River&quot;, which sampled &quot;Old Cape Cod&quot; by Patti Page. The song went on to be one of Groove Armada&#x27;s best-known tracks and has been found on numerous chill out compilations.

Their first album, &quot;Northern Star&quot;, was released in 1998 on Tummy Touch Records, and was followed by a second, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, in 1999, which had a more mainstream and &#x27;polished&#x27; sound, making the UK Album Chart&#x27;s upper 20 and being certified silver in the UK. It also included &quot;At the River&quot; which was re-released as a full-fledged single. An album of remixed tracks from &quot;Vertigo&quot; entitled &quot;The Remixes&quot; followed in 2000, along with their contribution to the &quot;Back to Mine&quot; mix album series.

The next studio album &quot;Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)&quot; was released in 2001 and marked a departure from their trip-hop roots to more upbeat music – as demonstrated on the Grammy-nominated single &quot;Superstylin&#x27;&quot;. Another mix album followed, this time for the &quot;Another Late Night&quot; series, and in 2002, less than a year after &quot;Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)&quot;, Groove Armada produced &quot;Lovebox&quot;, which included a variety of genres including rock, such as &quot;Madder&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, while others were closer to the band&#x27;s traditional house and trip hop roots, such as the title track &quot;Lovebox&quot;, and &quot;Remember&quot;, with the latter containing vocals made up entirely of samples of Sandy Denny&#x27;s vocals for Fairport Convention. An additional bonus track was later released on their website entitled &quot;Fairport&quot;. &quot;Lovebox&quot; also contained a song called &quot;Hands of Time&quot; which was subsequently used in the 2004 film &quot;Collateral&quot;.

A greatest hits album, entitled &quot;The Best of Groove Armada&quot;, released in 2004 – the last of their releases with Pepper Records – before their studio album &quot;Soundboy Rock&quot; was released in 2007. The album marked a notable departure from the multi-genre-influenced previous album, featuring tracks such as &quot;Get Down&quot; and &quot;Groove Extracts&quot;, which followed the contemporary house music trend, tracks with rock elements, and &quot;Song 4 Mutya (Out of Control)&quot; featuring the vocals of ex-Sugababes singer Mutya Buena, hailed by online music guide Popjustice as one of the best songs of 2007.

Following the successful &quot;Soundboy Rock&quot; singles, an updated best-of set titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released in October 2007. This was accompanied by &quot;GA10: 10 Year Story&quot;, a 2CD rarities collection released in November 2007 to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. The band has spoken in-depth about the compilation, and cited it as an &quot;emotional experience&quot;, with both members selecting their personal favourite songs and mixes from their history.

Groove Armada also released a collaboration with The Japanese Popstars through Strictly Rhythm, via Beatport, in April 2008.

In the same year, Groove Armada engaged in a deal with Bacardi to distribute their new 4-track EP using a file sharing platform called B-Live Share.

During 2009, Findlay and Cato repeatedly confirmed the existence of a pending new album. While on the Bacardi Express tour in Australia, Findlay said it will be called &quot;Black Light&quot; and &quot;is going to be the darker side of Groove Armada, which is finally coming out after 12 years.&quot; The first single, released on 23 November 2009, was &quot;I Won&#x27;t Kneel&quot;, featuring Groove Armada&#x27;s new vocalist, Saint Saviour. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Paper Romance&quot;, was released on 22 February 2010, and the album was released in Europe on 28 February.

In October 2010, Groove Armada released a remix album, &quot;White Light&quot;, which contained recent studio re-recordings of alternative live versions of many songs from &quot;Black Light&quot; as well as other classic Groove Armada songs. Groove Armada headlined Uber Cool festival at Jersey Live on 3 September. The duo embarked on a series of secretive &quot;living room&quot; sets, performing intimately across the country for audiences of close friends. Little information was given about these private performances, but the tour kicked off in Brighton in late January, 2011.

The group has collaborated with a diverse array of artists, including Max Taylor, Neneh Cherry, DJ Gramma Funk, Sophie Barker, Nappy Roots, Fudge Dog, Sunshine Anderson, Mutya Buena, Jeru the Damaja, Richie Havens, Will Young, Brodanse and Joel Culpepper.

In February 2014, the EP &quot;Pork Soda&quot; was released. It included three brand new tracks: &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, &quot;Hyde &amp; Freak&quot; and &quot;Jack in Black&quot;.

In 2015, Groove Armada released their eighth studio album, &quot;Little Black Book&quot;. The album has been described as &quot;somewhere between [an] album, mix CD, and compilation&quot;. The first disc features their own original music and remixes, while the second disc features remixes of their music by other artists.

Groove Armada released their ninth studio album &quot;Edge of the Horizon&quot; in 2020 featuring vocal performances from Nick Littlemore, James Alexander Bright, Todd Edwards, She Keeps Bees, Roseau, Paris Brightledge.

The duo played their last ever concerts in Australia and New Zealand in 2022.

In 2002, Cato collaborated with Rachel Foster, producing the album &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; under the name Weekend Players. He also co-wrote with Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her album &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot;, and released his first solo single under his own name, &quot;La Luna&quot;. Cato has also worked with Róisín Murphy on her album &quot;Overpowered&quot;, producing the singles &quot;Let Me Know&quot; and &quot;You Know Me Better&quot;.

<text>The Truong Son muntjac or Annamite muntjac (Muntiacus truongsonensis) is a species of muntjac deer. It is one of the smallest muntjac species, at about , half the size of the Indian muntjac (or common muntjac). It was discovered in the Truong Son (Annamite) mountain range in Vietnam in 1997.

It was identified by examination of skulls and descriptions provided by villagers, who call it &quot;samsoi cacoong&quot;, or &quot;the deer that lives in the deep, thick forest.&quot; It lives at elevations of 400–1000 metres, where its small size allows it to move through dense undergrowth.

<text>Earl of Middlesex was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1622 for Lionel Cranfield, 1st Baron Cranfield, the Lord High Treasurer. He had already been created Baron Cranfield, of Cranfield in the County of Bedford, the year before, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his elder son, the second Earl. On his early death in 1651 the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Earl. The titles became extinct when the latter died childless in 1674.

Lady Frances Cranfield, daughter of the first Earl and sister of the second and third Earls, married Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset. The barony and earldom were revived in 1675 in favour of their son Charles, who two years later also succeeded his father in the earldom of Dorset. See Duke of Dorset for further history of this creation.

<text>Armando Gonçalves Teixeira (; born 25 September 1976), known as Petit, is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, currently manager of Primeira Liga club Rio Ave.

He received the moniker &quot;Petit&quot; because of his small frame, and also because he was born in France. He also became known as &quot;Pitbull&quot; by supporters because of his fierce approach, in addition to a powerful outside shot.

After helping Boavista win their first and only Primeira Liga championship, he went on to amass more than 200 official appearances for Benfica, winning another three major titles. He also spent several seasons in Germany with 1. FC Köln, but his later years were marred by injury problems.

A Portugal international during the 2000s, Petit represented the nation in two World Cups – finishing fourth in the 2006 edition – and as many European Championships. He started working as a manager in 2012, with Boavista, and led five other top-flight teams.

==Club career==
===Early years and Boavista===
Petit was born to Portuguese parents in Strasbourg, France, and moved to his parents&#x27; motherland at the age of two, settling in the Bom Pastor area of Paranhos in Porto. After four years with modest clubs, he first established himself at the Primeira Liga with Gil Vicente where he was a key player, helping the Barcelos team to their best-ever first division finish (fifth, narrowly missing out on qualification for the UEFA Cup).

Petit left for Boavista after one season, being instrumental in the side&#x27;s only league conquest and going on to have his first experience in the UEFA Champions League. He made his debut in the latter competition on 11 September 2001, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 group stage away draw against Liverpool.

===Benfica===
In July 2002, Petit moved to Benfica on a five-year deal for €3 million, with Boavista retaining half of his economic rights. He became an instant first choice, and in his third year, he scored twice in 29 games as the club ended an 11-year drought and won the national championship.

In June 2005, immediately after winning the league, Petit extended his contract until 2010. He scored his only European goals in 2006–07 as the team reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup; the goals came in wins at the Estádio da Luz over Austria Wien (Champions League third qualifying round) and Paris Saint-Germain (quarter-final second leg).

===FC Köln===

On 30 July 2008, Petit signed a two-year contract with newly-promoted 1. FC Köln from Germany, with the option of a third; Benfica retained first choice were he to return to his homeland, and would receive €3 million if he chose another Portuguese team. He netted his first goal with his new club on 7 August, against SV Niederauerbach in the first round of the domestic cup. On 1 November, he scored his first in the Bundesliga, a 90th-minute effort against VfB Stuttgart in a 3–1 victory, ending his debut season with 31 matches out of 34 as the team easily retained their status.

The 35-year-old Petit missed the entire 2011–12 due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and Köln were also relegated. In August 2012, he returned to Boavista, with the club now in the third division.

==International career==
Petit made his debut for Portugal on 2 June 2001, in a 1–1 draw against Republic of Ireland in Dublin for the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He played for the nation in the finals, and was also a member of the team that reached the final at UEFA Euro 2004, held on home soil.

Petit scored from two long free kicks in a 7–1 home drubbing of Russia in the 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign, going on to be selected for the final stages in Germany where he netted an own goal in the 61st minute of the third place playoff against the hosts, becoming the fourth player in the tournament to score in that fashion.

Prior to the start of Euro 2008, Petit announced that he would retire from international football at 31. In total, he won 57 caps and scored four goals.

==Coaching career==
===Boavista===
In October 2012, Petit was appointed player-coach of Boavista, becoming the full-time manager in the following season. The club returned to the top flight for administrative reasons in 2014, and on his professional managerial debut he lost 1–0 at home to Benfica on 24 August.

On 28 November 2015, Petit left the hotseat at the Estádio do Bessa for personal motives.

===Tondela===
Eleven days after leaving Boavista, Petit was appointed at Tondela for their first top-division campaign. He was the last of three coaches in charge, as the team avoided relegation in the last matchday.

Subsequently, Petit signed a new deal to last until 2018, but left on 8 January 2017 after a 1–2 home loss to Arouca. 

===Four appointments in two years===
In March 2017, Petit was hired at Moreirense with the goal of keeping them in the main division, and left two months later by mutual consent when that was achieved. On 23 October, Paços de Ferreira hired him in an attempt to preserve their place in the top tier, and he left by his own accord the following January. 

Petit returned to Moreirense in February 2018 as their third manager of the season, and left again after keeping them up. He was appointed manager of Marítimo on 27 November, on a contract lasting until the end of the campaign. He left the Madeiran club at its conclusion, as it did not exercise the option of another year.

===B-SAD===
On 15 January 2020, Petit was hired by his sixth Portuguese top-division side, becoming the third coach of B-SAD&#x27;s campaign as they were one point above the relegation zone. He reached the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal in his one complete season, being eliminated 3–0 at Benfica. On 19 October 2021, having needed a goal in the last minute of extra time to defeat minnows Berço in the cup, he resigned with eight months of his contract remaining; the team had earned four points and no wins in the first eight games of the league campaign.

===Return to Boavista===
Petit returned to Boavista on 2 December 2021, on a deal until 2023. Two weeks later, he took the club to the Taça da Liga semi-finals for the first time following a 5–1 home rout of Braga; on 5 February, his contract was extended for another year.

At the end of a 1–1 home draw with Marítimo on 9 October 2022, Petit was sent off for insults towards the refereeing team and fined €1,632. He was suspended for the following game, a 1–0 loss in the third round of the cup away to fourth-tier Machico.

Petit resigned on 11 December 2023, following a 3–1 league loss at Estrela da Amadora that was his side&#x27;s fifth in a row; it was accepted the following day.

===Cuiabá===
On 1 May 2024, Petit took over as coach of Campeonato Brasileiro Série A club Cuiabá. On 27 August, following a 5–0 loss to Palmeiras as part of an eight-match winless run, he resigned.

<text>The SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) is a crewed submersible and a type of swimmer delivery vehicle used to deliver United States Navy SEALs and their equipment for special operations missions. It is operated by SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams. 

The SDV, which has been in continuous service since 1983, is used primarily for covert or clandestine missions to denied access areas (either held by hostile forces or where military activity would draw notice and objection). It is generally deployed from the Dry Deck Shelter on a specially-modified attack or ballistic missile submarines, although it can also be launched from surface ships or land. It has seen combat in the Gulf War, Iraq War, and the US intervention in Somalia.

The SDV was intended to be replaced with the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), a larger, dry submersible that is often confused with the SDV. The SDV is flooded, and the swimmers ride exposed to the water, breathing from the vehicle&#x27;s compressed air supply or using their own SCUBA gear, while the ASDS is dry inside and equipped with a full life support and air conditioning system. The ASDS was canceled in 2009 due to cost overruns and the loss of the prototype in a fire. The Navy currently plans to replace the SDV with the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS), which will be designated the Mark 11 SDV. The SWCS was expected to enter service in 2019.

==History==
The SDV program dates back to World War II. Initiated by the Office of Strategic Services Maritime Unit (OSS MU). A “submersible canoe” was invented by the Italians during World War I. The idea was successfully applied by the Italian Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) also early in World War II. The official Italian name for their craft was &quot;Siluro a Lenta Corsa&quot; (SLC or &quot;Slow-running torpedo&quot;). The vehicle was then copied by the British when they discovered the Italian operations and called it the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; or Motorised Submersible Canoe. It was employed by OSS MU during extensive training and exercises, but was never actually deployed for combat operations.

The same capability was adopted by the American Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) in 1947. The one-man submersible displayed little functional military potential. However, it substantiated and characterized the need for improved and expanded UDT capabilities. After the war, development continued in a garage-shop fashion by various UDT units, and included various &quot;Marks&quot; such as the Mark V, VI, and VII. Intermediate numbers were assigned to some vehicles that never made it off the shop floor. All were of flooded design.

The first SDV to be operationally deployed was the Mark VII, which entered service in June 1972 after being tested between 1967 and 1972. It could carry three SEALs plus a pilot sitting in compartments fore and aft. It had a hull made from fiberglass and non-ferrous metals to hinder detection and was powered by a silver-zinc battery attached to an electric motor. The Mark VIII SDV, the model that is still in use today, began to supplant the Mark VII starting in 1983.

The wet vehicle SDV program (officially named the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle, later re-designated the SEAL Delivery Vehicle after the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle Teams were renamed SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams) currently centers on the Mark VIII Mod 1. The SDV was first developed in 1975 for use among UDT/SEAL teams. The early Mark 8 Mod 0 SDVs had a PRC104 UHF radio for use underwater. The newer model Mark 8 Mod 1 has a dual sliding canopy and quick release hatch.
==Design==
SDVs carry a pilot, co-pilot, and four person combat swimmer team and their equipment to and from maritime mission objectives on land or at sea. The pilot and co-pilot are often a part of the fighting team. The SDV is silver-zinc battery powered and equipped with propulsion, navigation, communication, and life-support equipment. The batteries directly power the electric motor that drives the single screw propeller. Because they are all electric, SDVs are extremely difficult to detect using passive sonar, and their small size makes them hard to detect using other means. The Mark 8 Mod 1 SDV can deliver four fully equipped SEALs to the mission area, be &quot;parked&quot; or loiter in the area, retrieve the SEALs, and then return to the launch site. The SEALs sit upright in the Mark 8, with the pilot and co-pilot/navigator facing forward and the other four facing aft. For air, the SEALs rely on their own air tanks or rebreathers, supplemented by compressed air tanks on the SDV. The crew and passenger compartment in the Mark 8 is small, cramped, and pitch black except for the dim lights of the instrument panel; SEALs describe riding in an SDV as like &quot;being locked in a little black coffin deep under the water.&quot; A 2011 article reported that out of 2,600 SEALS roughly 230 are trained to operate the SDVs. 

SDVs are generally launched from a Dry Deck Shelter on the back of a submarine, although they can also be deployed from amphibious carriers and other surface ships equipped to launch and recover the SDV. SDVs are launched and recovered by surface ships using a crane. They can also be airdropped (uncrewed) into an operational area from a C-130 Hercules airplane. Finally, the SDV can be launched from the shore.

An SDV can be launched from one platform and recovered by another. demonstrated this capability during a multilateral exercise in the Mediterranean when it recovered and then launched another country&#x27;s SDV.

===Mark 8 SDV===
The Mark 8 Mod 1 SDV is the only SDV officially in use by the US Navy and Royal Navy. It is an upgrade of the earlier Mark 8 Mod 0 SDV. The Mod 1 is quieter, faster, more efficient, and has a longer range than the Mod 0. Its updated electronics, materials, and battery and motor systems gives it twice the range and 1.5 times the speed of the Mod 0. Another advantage of the Mark 8 Mod 1 over its predecessor is that it is built from aluminium instead of plastic reinforced fiberglass, making its hull sturdier and roomier. The sturdier hull means that it can be deployed from CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters, although SDVs often break or explode when dropped in the water from a helicopter, making aerial deployments impractical and undesirable.

The Mark 8 Mod 1 SDV has an endurance of about eight to 12 hours, giving it a range of with a diving team or without. The main limiting factor on endurance is not batteries or breathing gas for the SEALs, but water temperature: humans can only spend so much time in cold water, even with wetsuits, before their blood pressure drops and they become dehydrated from losing blood volume and body fluids, respectively.
===Mark 9 SDV===
Despite being a development of the Mark 8 SDV, the Mark 9 is a very different vehicle, designed for attacking surface ships rather than deploying SEAL teams on clandestine operations. Indeed, the Mark 9 and Mark 8 share very few common parts. The Mark 9 carries two SEALs, a pilot and a navigator, and two Mark 31 or Mark 37 torpedoes for standoff attacks against ships. These torpedoes can travel up to in a straight line, carry a warhead, and are capable of sinking ships as large as cruisers. In addition to torpedoes, the Mark 9 also carried limpet mines and satchel charges in a large cargo compartment aft of the pilot and co-pilot.

The Mark 9 is designed to clandestinely approach enemy vessels while submerged, surface to fire torpedoes, and then escape unnoticed. As such, its design incorporates stealth characteristics, including a lower profile and sonar absorbing materials. The Mark 9 SDV was intended to attack ships in shallow coastal waters that full-size submarines could not enter, and to draw attention of an enemy fleet away from the Mark 9&#x27;s parent submarine. Though it proved very effective in exercises, the Mark 9 was retired starting in 1989 and was fully phased out of service by the mid-1990s due to manpower and budget constraints and because all of its capabilities save launching torpedoes were duplicated by the Mark 8.

The pilot and navigator operate the vehicle from a prone position and lay side by side. The prone position gave the Mark 9 a low profile and enabled it to operate in very shallow water, although SEALs reported that staying prone for the entire duration of an operation was uncomfortable.

The Mark 9&#x27;s sleek profile and independent diving planes enabled it to be especially agile. It was also faster than the Mark 8, reaching speeds of , owing to its twin screw propellers and high-performance silver-zinc batteries. Its speed and agility led operators to compare it to flying a fighter jet or driving a sports car.

==Operational history==
The SDV is used primarily for inserting SEALs for covert operations or for placing mines on ships. It is also used for underwater mapping and terrain exploration, location and recovery of lost or downed objects, and reconnaissance missions. It has been invaluable at deploying SEAL teams in clandestine missions, as it has enabled them to land on shores inaccessible to a larger submarine with a degree of stealth greater than that offered by small surface craft, helicopters, or other means. In exercises, the SDV has been found to excel at anti-shipping attacks, being able to attack targets in heavily-guarded fleets or docked at military bases and then slip away undetected. Additionally, it can carry larger limpet mines than those carried by a diver and has a much greater range than a diver, enabling attacks on larger and more distant enemy ships. However, the SDV is not without its weaknesses, namely its range, reliability, and mobility. The SDV&#x27;s short range, which is contingent on sea state, water temperature, payload, and other factors, sometimes hinders operations. In one example, the Navy wanted to use an SDV to get a closer look at a Soviet ship anchored in a Cuban harbor upriver from the Caribbean Sea. The SDV could not have made the round trip to the Soviet vessel from an American ship outside of Cuba&#x27;s territorial waters, so the mission had to be called off.

Mark 8 SDVs saw combat during the First Gulf War, where they performed mine reconnaissance and demolition missions. In the Iraq War, Mark 8 SDVs were used to secure offshore oil and gas terminals. Several days before the beginning of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, two SDV teams were launched from Mark V Special Operations Craft in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the hydrographic reconnaissance of the Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals. After swimming under the terminals and securing their Mark 8 Mod 1s, the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats. On March 20, 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 Navy EOD, 1 USAF combat controller, and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal and KAAOT Oil Terminals, in part using SDVs. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by Polish GROM operators.

In 2003, SEALs using SEAL Delivery Vehicles swam ashore along the Somali coastline and emplaced covert surveillance cameras. Known as cardinals, the cameras were designed to watch likely target locations for wanted terrorists as al-Qaeda and its affiliates began to regroup in the country, however the cameras only took one image a day and captured very little.

In American service, the SDV is deployed with SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1 (SDVT-1), based in Pearl Harbor, and SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 2 (SDVT-2), based in Little Creek, Virginia. SDVT-1 operates on behalf of Central Command and Pacific Command in the Middle East and Indian and Pacific Oceans. SDVT-2 operates in the Atlantic and European Command and Southern Command, and is primarily focused on supporting the activities of the Sixth Fleet.

The SDV suffered from reliability concerns early in its lifespan. LCDR Doug Lowe, a member of SDV Team 1 in the 1980s, reported that his team&#x27;s SDVs were operational less than 50 percent of the time. However, reliability improved with usage: LCDR Lowe later commanded SDV Team 2 in the 1990s and reported that his subs were ready more than 90 percent of the time.

The main failure of the SDV is its poor mobility. The SDV can only be effectively deployed from specially modified submarines and surface ships. Although it can be transported by C-130 airplanes, the relative scarcity of vessels capable of deploying an SDV limits its usage. Submarines are the preferred means of deployment, as enemies can see a surface ship deploying an SDV with a crane, further limiting the SDV&#x27;s mobility and usage. Modifying a surface ship to launch and recover the SDV through an underwater door, like the Italian Navy had done for its human torpedoes in WWII, would have helped alleviate this problem.

The Special Boat Service of the United Kingdom Special Forces operates three Mark 8 Mod 1 vehicles.

<text>Aid climbing is a form of rock climbing that uses mechanical devices and equipment, such as aiders (or ladders), for upward momentum. Aid climbing is contrasted with free climbing (in both its traditional or sport free climbing formats), which only uses mechanical equipment for protection, but not to assist in upward momentum. Aid climbing can involve hammering in permanent pitons and bolts, into which the aiders are clipped, but there is also &#x27;clean aid climbing&#x27; which avoids any hammering, and only uses removable placements.

While aid climbing traces its origins to the start of all climbing when ladders and pitons were common, its use in single-pitch climbing waned in the early 20th century with the rise of free climbing. At the same time, the Dolomites became the birthplace of modern &quot;big wall aid climbing&quot;, where pioneers like Emilio Comici developed the early tools and techniques. Aid climbing&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; was in the 1960s and 1970s on Yosemite&#x27;s granite big walls led by pioneers such as Royal Robbins and Warren Harding, and later Jim Bridwell, and was also where Robbins&#x27; ethos of minimal-aid, and Yvon Chouinard&#x27;s ethos of clean aid climbing, became dominant.

In the 1990s, the traditional A-grading system was expanded at Yosemite into a more detailed &quot;new wave&quot; system, and with the development and growth in clean aid climbing, the A-grade became the C-grading system. The grading of aid-climbing routes is complex as successive repeats can substantially change the nature of the challenge through hammering and also the build-up of large amounts of in-situ fixed placements. It is not untypical for a new A5-graded aid-climbing route, to migrate to an A3-graded route over time.

Aid climbing is still used on large big wall climbing and alpine climbing routes to overcome sections of extreme difficulty that are beyond the difficulties of the rest of the route. A famous big wall climb such as &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan is accessible to strong climbers as a partial-aid route graded VI C2, but only a tiny handful can handle its grade as a free climbed route. Aid is also used to develop &quot;next generation&quot; big wall routes (e.g. &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; on Cordillera Paine, or the &quot;Grand Voyage&quot; on Trango Towers). Extreme C5-graded aid-only routes are also still being established, such as &quot;Nightmare on California Street &quot; on El Capitan.

==Description==

Aid climbing is a form of rock climbing that uses mechanical devices and equipment for upward momentum. Like traditional and sport climbing, aid climbing is typically done in pairs with a lead climber making the &quot;placements&quot; into which ladders (known as aiders) are clipped, thus enabling them to ascend. After the lead climber has reached the top, the second climber (or belayer) then removes the placements as they jumar up the rope.

Traditional aid climbing relied on fixed placements, which were mainly metal pitons that the lead climber hammered into the rock as they ascended. These placements remained permanently fixed on the route (and in such cases, the second (or belayer) didn&#x27;t have to take any placement out and just jumared up on a fixed rope). Clean aid climbing avoids any hammering and uses the temporary protection of traditional climbing (e.g. spring-loaded camming devices) for placements; these are then removed by the second climber as they make their own ascent. This method therefore avoids the damage that repeated hammering of metal does to aid routes, and has been advocated as useful training and building up of experience in the placing of traditional climbing protection.

While the sport of aid climbing has waned as the free climbing movement has grown, elements of aid climbing are still a regular feature of many major big wall climbing and alpine climbing routes. These routes are long multi-pitch climbs where it is possible to find specific sections that are considerably above the difficulty level of the rest of the route. For such sections, aid climbing techniques are accepted, even by free climbers. For example, the renowned big wall climbing route &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan is a 31-pitch 870-metre graded partial clean aid climb at VI C2, but as a fully free climb with no aid, it is graded VI , which is beyond the skills of all but a very small group of elite free climbers.

==History==
Aid climbing traces its origins to the start of all climbing, with ladders used on historic ascents such as the 1492 ascent of Mont Aiguille, the 1786 ascent of Mont Blanc, or the 1893 ascent of Devils Tower, and with drilled bolts on historic ascents such as the 1875 first ascent of Half Dome. By the start of the 20th century, the widespread use of aid (e.g. ladders and pitons) was challenged by the free climbing movement led by Paul Preuss. While the use of aid diminished on single-pitch routes, big wall climbers in the Dolomites, such as , further developed aid climbing techniques. The legacy of the Dolomites as the birthplace of big-wall and modern aid climbing was cemented by pioneer Emilio Comici who developed the multi-step aider (or ladder). In 1933, Comici used these aid climbing techniques to climb the overhanging north face of the Cima Grande, then the world&#x27;s hardest big wall aid route. Comici&#x27;s aid techniques were used by the leading European big wall and alpine climbers such as Riccardo Cassin on famous routes across the European Alps.

In 1946, John Salathé developed a piton made from high-carbon chrome-vanadium (salvaged from the axles of Ford cars), which enabled him to overcome the hard granite cracks of Yosemite and climb the iconic Lost Arrow Spire in 1947 with Ax Nelson. Salathé&#x27;s new aid climbing equipment (including the skyhook), led to a &quot;golden age&quot; in big wall aid climbing. In 1957, a team led by Royal Robbins used Salathé&#x27;s aid tools to climb the &quot;Northwest Face of Half Dome&quot; in Yosemite, ushering in modern American big wall aid climbing. In 1958, a team led by Warren Harding aid climbed &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan using siege tactics (600 pitons and 125 bolts) over 47 days; while the ascent got worldwide recognition it was controversial due to the excessive use of aid. Robbins&#x27; ethos of minimizing the use of aid prevailed over that of Harding, and his legacy of partially-aided ascents including the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; (1961), the &quot;North American Wall&quot; (1964), and the &quot;Muir Wall&quot; (1968) cemented Yosemite, and the granite walls of El Capitan, as the world&#x27;s most important big wall aid climbing venue, and Robbins&#x27; place in climbing history.

1970 saw one of the most infamous events in big wall aid climbing with the creation of Cesare Maestri&#x27;s &quot;Compressor Route&quot; on Cerro Torre. Maestri drilled an extreme amount of bolts into the famous headwall using a 300-pound air compressor drill; in one section, he drilled across a blank 90-metre face to avoid the wind. Maestri&#x27;s excessive use of aid was condemned. In 1971, Reinhold Messner wrote a now-famous essay titled &quot;The Murder of the Impossible&quot; on the trend of excessive aid saying: &quot;Today&#x27;s climber ... carries his courage in his rucksack&quot;. Another famous essay in 1972, by big wall pioneers Yvon Chouinard and Tom Frost, appealed for clean aid climbing techniques to avoid the damage incurred by pitons and hammers. Messner&#x27;s and Chouinard&#x27;s essays marked the end of the excessive aid techniques. The 1970s saw new big wall aid climbing pioneers such as Jim Bridwell pushing standards in Yosemite using less intrusive aid (e.g. Chouinard&#x27;s RURPs) to put up groundbreaking routes such as &quot;Pacific Ocean Wall&quot; (1975) and &quot;Sea of Dreams&quot; (1978), with its famous A5-graded &quot;Hook or Book&quot; pitch, the first &quot;if you fall, you die&quot; rope length on El Capitan.

Bridwell and others pushed big wall aid climbing standards into the 1980s and 1990s with ever-harder A5-graded routes like &quot;Reticent Wall&quot; (1995) on the blank south faces of El Capitan. The arrival sport climbing in the late 1980s saw a dramatic rise in rock climbing standards. Many big wall aid climbs were freed, with the most notable being Lynn Hill&#x27;s 1993 free climb of &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan at 5.14a. Aid climbing continued to be a skill set for big wall and alpine climbers in both being able to complete routes that would otherwise be almost impossible to most climbers (e.g. &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan) and in creating &quot;next generation&quot; big wall and alpine routes that are not capable of being fully freed (e.g. the &quot;Grand Voyage&quot; on Trango Towers). In a 1999 essay in &quot;Ascent&quot; titled &quot;The Mechanical Advantage&quot;, big wall aid climber and author, John Middendorf, said of that Hill&#x27;s achievement on &quot;The Nose&quot;: &quot;But without the old piton scars, without fixed protection, without her big-wall aid climbing experience, without the extraordinary free-climbing ability she gained from bolted sport climbs and indoor gyms and competitions, would there have ever been a such a free ascent?&quot;

In 2012, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; added the term &quot;aid climbing&quot;.

==Equipment==
Modern aid climbing typically uses most of the equipment used in traditional climbing and particularly the protection equipment of traditional climbing (e.g. nuts, hexcentrics and tricams, and spring-loaded camming devices) that are needed for clean aid climbing. Where aid climbing is done as part of big wall climbing – which is normally its most common format – then even more equipment is required (e.g. including haul bags, hauling pulleys and trail ropes; portaledges, and poop tubes).

A number of unique items of equipment are also used in aid climbing:

===Fixed placement equipment===

Before the introduction of clean aid climbing, placements were hammered-in by the aid climber as they ascended, with metal pitons hammered into cracks being a common placement (and the various piton types including Lost Arrows, bongs, angles and knifeblades), but also including copperheads (or heads); aid climbers may also use bolt kits to place fixed bolts where there are no suitable cracks for pitons while ascending.

===Aiders and daisy chain systems===
The equipment used to ascend via the hammered in placements are dual sets of aiders, which are like ladders made of webbing material, and come in various styles including adjustable strap-aiders, and stirrup-style &quot;etriers&quot;. These aiders are attached to the aid climber via a matching dual set of daisy chains (which can be loop-style or adjustable), and the aid climber will use fifi hooks to manage the effective length of the daisy chains.

===Hooks and hangers===
Various types of rock climbing use hooks as temporary placements, but they feature most commonly in aid climbing where on more difficult aid-climbing routes (e.g. grades above A2+), the aid climber is expected to be able to use placements that can only handle their static bodyweight (but may otherwise fail in the case of a dynamic fall); the range of hook types used in aid climbing includes skyhooks, cam hooks and rivet hangers.

===Ascenders and fixed rope jumaring equipment===
Aid climbing, and particularly for the belayer following the lead aid climbing, usually employ fixed rope ascending equipment, with ascenders being the most common devices, to reduce the effort on long big wall aid climbs.

==Techniques==

Aid climbing, for both &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot;, is a very different type of climbing to traditional climbing, relying almost exclusively on mechanical devices for upward momentum. A number of specific techniques are important in aid climbing, which include the following:

===Making placements===
Aid climbing relies on the climber making placements onto the rock into which they attach aiders and ascend. Traditional aid climbing involved hammering in fixed placements (e.g. pitons, bolts, copperheads), a practice that made traditional aid climbing routes easier over time as later teams could use the placements of earlier teams. On advanced aid routes (i.e. A-grade above A3+), the act of hammering in fixed placements can be enough to shake the climber off the existing tenuous placements, so care and skill are required. Clean aid climbing avoids using any hammers, and thus the placements are effectively those of a traditional climber (although hooks are also used). Aid climbers generally try to make placements as high above their current position as possible to move efficiently.

===Using aiders===
Once a new placement is made, the aid climber will clip their daisy chain and an aider into the latest placement above their head and then bounce-test it; on passing that test, they then fully step into the aider attached to this new placement while clipping in the rope into the lower placement. Once completed, they release the lower daisy chain and its aider from the lower placement and climb up the new aider. These steps must be done in sequence to avoid a position where the climber comes free of any placement, or becomes temporarily dependent on a weak position.

===Bounce testing===
Free climbers will only know if their protection placements can carry the weight of a fall if it happens; some will pull on their placements as a simple test, but placing their body weight on the placement would be a form of aid. In contrast, aid climbers continuously &quot;bounce test&quot; their placements by loading their body weight onto them while using the lower placement as a backup in case the new placement fails. Excessive bounce-testing can make the extraction of the placements by the second climber difficult (i.e. the placements become really wedged into the cracks) and can result in longer timelines, damaged rock (where hammers are used to extract the placement), or having to leave placements on the route.

===Jumaring on fixed ropes===
The second climber in aid climbing usually jumars up on a fixed rope while taking out any removable placements on the way. Even the leader may also jumar back up the rope after having retrieved lower pieces of equipment that are needed again. This is in contrast to traditional climbing where the second (or belayer) will normally climb the route (albeit on a top rope).

==Grading==

===Issues with aid grading===

The grading of aid climbs is regarded as being complex and in a state of flux. Aid grades can change materially over time due to improvements in aid equipment and the impact of repeated ascents that subsequent aid climbing teams make to a route. Climbing author Chris McNamara outlines in his 2011 book &quot;Yosemite Big Walls&quot;, how the grade of a typical &quot;new A5 route&quot; in Yosemite evolves over time:
* A5. First 5 teams to ascend: The new route has very little installed or fixed in-situ equipment (e.g. copperheads, pitons, bolts), and the rock is weak and fragile in places.
* A4. Teams 6 to 20 ascend: Half the copperheads are now fixed, pin placements are solid (from repeated hammering), bolts have replaced pulled or broken rock features; some &#x27;chicken bolts&#x27; (i.e. excess bolting) are added at cruxes, and fully bolted belay anchors in places.
* A3/A4. Teams 21 to 40 ascend: Almost all the copperheads are fixed; all of the weak and loose rock is gone; more belay bolts and &quot;chicken bolts&quot; have been installed.
* A3+. Teams +41 ascend: The route now &quot;reaches equilibrium&quot;; all copperheads are in place and the cruxes fixed; piton placements so beat out that they now easily take hammerless gear.

While different aid grading systems have been devised to address this (e.g. the &quot;new wave&quot;), in &quot;Yosemite Big Walls&quot;, McNamara argues: &quot;Although it was originally touted as being more precise, than the previous A1-A5 system, it is now clear the new wave system only brought more confusion to the rating process&quot;. In practice, aid-climbing authors use a &quot;composite&quot; of the two systems (original and &quot;new wave&quot;), going from A0 to A6, and focused on the number of &quot;bodyweight placements&quot; (i.e. &quot;tenuous&quot; aid placements that can only hold a static bodyweight) as opposed to &quot;bombproof placements&quot; (belay-like aid placements that can hold a falling body) on a pitch, as a guide to the consequences of any leader fall.

===Original A-grades===
Original aid climbing grades go from A0 to A5 and focus on the number of &quot;bodyweight placements&quot; as opposed to &quot;bombproof placements&quot; on a given pitch. They are less concerned with the physical demands of an aid route. In Yosemite, the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;X&quot; suffixes of the American YDS free climbing system are added for routes with dangers of falls onto ledges or ramps or the risk of cutting the rope on an edge, such as pitch 13 on &quot;Reticent Wall&quot; at A4R.

The original aid climbing grades are described by the American Alpine Club as follows: &quot;In general, older routes, routes with little aid, and those put up by climbers without extensive big-wall experience use the original aid rating system&quot;:

*A0: &quot;Occasional aid moves are often done without aiders (etriers) or climbed on fixed gear; sometimes called &quot;French free&#x27;&quot;.
*A1: &quot;All placements are solid and easy&quot;.
*A2: &quot;Good placements, but sometimes tricky to find&quot;.
*A3: &quot;Many difficult, insecure placements, but with little risk&quot;.
*A4: &quot;Many placements in a row that hold nothing more than body weight&quot;.
*A5: &quot;Enough body-weight placements in a row that one failure results in a fall of at least 20 metres&quot;.

===New wave A-grades===
In the 1990s, Yosemite aid climbers created the &quot;new wave&quot; aid grading system that expanded the range of the original system to A6, introduced an intermediate (+) grade from A2 onwards for specific strenuous sections, and gave detailed definitions for each level. As with the original system, the main focus is still on discerning the number of &quot;bodyweight placements&quot; on a route, and therefore the consequences of a fall.

&quot;New wave&quot; grades are described by the American Alpine Club (republished in 2013) as: &quot;Newer routes put-up by big-wall aficionados often are given a &quot;New Wave&quot; aid rating using the same symbols with new definitions&quot;:

*A1: &quot;Easy aid. No risk of a piece pulling out&quot;.
*A2: &quot;Moderate aid. Solid gear that&#x27;s more difficult to place&quot;.
*A2+: &quot;10-metre fall potential from tenuous placements, but without danger&quot;.
*A3: &quot;Hard aid. Many tenuous placements in a row, 15-metre fall potential, could require several hours for a single pitch&quot;.
*A3+: &quot;A3 with dangerous fall potential&quot;.
*A4: &quot;Serious aid. 30-metre ledge-fall potential from continuously tenuous gear&quot;.
*A4+:&quot;Even more serious, with even greater fall potential, where each pitch could take many hours to lead&quot;.
*A5: &quot;Extreme aid. Nothing on the entire pitch can be trusted to hold a fall&quot;.
*A6: &quot;A5 climbing with belay anchors that won&#x27;t hold a fall either&quot;.

===Clean C-grades===

When the original or the &quot;new wave&quot; aid climbs can be ascended without the use of a hammer (for pitons or copperheads) the &quot;A&quot; suffix is replaced by a &quot;C&quot; to denote &quot;clean climbing&quot;. In Yosemite, an &quot;F&quot; suffix is placed after the &quot;C&quot; if fixed gear (e.g. bolts) is still required.

==Milestones==

The following are some of the most notable milestones in the development of aid climbing routes:

===High altitude and expedition===

*1991. Wolfgang Gullich, Kurt Albert, Bernd Arnold, Norbert Bätz, and Peter Dittrich climb &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; on the Cordillera Paine in 21-days with 44-pitches, VI 5.12d A3; considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Torres del Paine. It was only freed in 2024 at a grade of by Siebe Vanhee, , , and Drew Smith, who said conditions makes it feel like a 5.14.
*1992. John Middendorf and climb &quot;The Grand Voyage&quot; on the East Face of Great Trango Tower in 16-days with 33-pitches, VII 5.10 A4+ WI3; at over 1,340 metres in length, &quot;The Grand Voyage&quot; is the world&#x27;s longest &#x27;vertical&#x27; rock climbing route, and at a very high altitude.

===North America===

*1957. Royal Robbins, Jerry Gallwas, and Mike Sherrick climb the &quot;Northwest Face of Half Dome&quot; in Yosemite in 5 days with 25-pitches, 5.7 A3, 275 pitons and 20 aid bolts. Birth of modern US big wall climbing; historians split the climbing history of Yosemite into: &quot;before and after Half Dome&quot;.
*1958. Warren Harding George Whitmore and Wayne Merry climb the 3,000-foot &quot;The Nose&quot; of El Capitan in 45 days with 31-pitches, 5.8 A3, 600 pitons and 125 aid bolts; climb gets worldwide recognition but is controversial among climbers for its excessive use of aid climbing techniques.
*1961. Royal Robbins, Chuck Pratt, and Tom Frost, climb the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; on El Capitan in 6 days with 35-pitches, 5.9 A4, 484 pitons, and only 13 aid bolts; one of the hardest big wall aid-climbs in the world at the time, and completed without fixed ropes.
*1978. Jim Bridwell, Dale Bard and Dave Diegelman climb &quot;Sea of Dreams&quot; on El Capitan in 27-pitches, VI 5.9 A4+ (it started at A5), and with minimal bolts and pitons (mostly RURPs); was the hardest big wall aid-climb in the world at the time, with its infamous &quot;Hook or Book&quot; pitch, the first &quot;you fall, you die&quot; pitch on El Capitan and even decades later is still A4+; considered Bridwell&#x27;s greatest route.
*1995. Steve Gerberding, Lori Reddel, and Scott Stowe climb &quot;Reticent Wall&quot; on El Capitan in 21-pitches, VI 5.7 A5, considered at the time as one of the hardest aid climbing routes on El Capitan (and the world), and still remains an A5/4+-graded route.
*1998. Warren Hollinger and Grant Gardner climb &quot;Nightmare on California Street&quot; on El Capitan, with 17-pitches, VI 5.10 A5, often considered El Capitan&#x27;s hardest aid climb (alongside the controversial 1982 route, &quot;Wings of Steel&quot;); still remains unrepeated (2023).

==In film==

A few notable films have been made focused on aid wall climbing including: 
*&quot;Assault on El Capitan&quot;, a 2013 documentary film of Ammon McNeely&#x27;s 2011 repeat of the controversial 1982 route, &quot;Wings of Steel&quot;, on El Capitan.
*&quot;The Inner Wall&quot;, a 2018 short documentary film from Reel Rock (Season 4, Episode 2) on Andy Kirkpatrick rope solo aid climbing on El Capitan.

<doc id="774547" wikidata="Q212657" url="?curid=774547" title="Artemisia Gentileschi">
<text>Artemisia Lomi or Artemisia Gentileschi (; ; 8 July 1593) was an Italian Baroque painter. Gentileschi is considered among the most accomplished 17th-century artists, initially working in the style of Caravaggio. She was producing professional work by the age of 15. In an era when women had few opportunities to pursue artistic training or work as professional artists, Gentileschi was the first woman to become a member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence and she had an international clientele.

Many of Gentileschi&#x27;s paintings feature women from myths, allegories, and the Bible, including victims, suicides, and warriors. Some of her best-known subjects are &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; (particularly the 1610 version in Pommersfelden), &quot;Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot; (her 1614–1620 version is in the Uffizi gallery), and &quot;Judith and Her Maidservant&quot; (her 1625 work is in the Detroit Institute of Arts).
Gentileschi was known for being able to depict the female figure with great naturalism and for her skill in handling colour to express dimension and drama.

Her achievements as an artist were long overshadowed by the story of Agostino Tassi raping her when she was a young woman and Gentileschi being tortured to give evidence during his trial. For many years Gentileschi was regarded as a curiosity, but her life and art have been reexamined by scholars in the 20th and 21st centuries, with the recognition of her talents exemplified by major exhibitions at internationally esteemed fine art institutions, such as the National Gallery in London.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Artemisia Lomi Gentileschi was born in Rome on 8 July 1593, although her birth certificate from the Archivio di Stato indicates she was born in 1590. She was the eldest child of Prudenzia di Ottaviano Montoni and the Tuscan painter Orazio Gentileschi. Orazio Gentileschi was a painter from Pisa. After his arrival in Rome, his painting reached its expressive peak, taking inspiration from the innovations of Caravaggio, from whom he derived the habit of painting real models, without idealising or sweetening them, instead transfiguring them into figures of powerful and realistic drama.

Baptised two days after her birth in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, Artemisia was primarily raised by her father following the death of her mother in 1605. It was likely at this time that Artemisia approached painting: introduced to painting in her father&#x27;s workshop, Artemisia showed much more enthusiasm and talent than her brothers, who worked alongside her. She learned drawing, how to mix colour, and how to paint. By 1612, aged 18, Artemisia was known for her exemplary talents, with her father boasting that, despite having only practised painting for three years, Artemisia was peerless.

During this early period of her life, Artemisia took inspiration from her father&#x27;s painting style, which had in turn been heavily influenced by the work of Caravaggio. Artemisia&#x27;s approach to subject matter was different from that of her father, however, taking a highly naturalistic approach over her father&#x27;s comparatively idealised works.

Her earliest surviving work, completed aged 17, is &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; (1610, Schönborn collection in Pommersfelden). The painting depicts the Biblical story of Susanna. The painting shows how Artemisia assimilated the realism of and effects used by Caravaggio without being indifferent to the classicism of Annibale Carracci and the Bolognese School of Baroque style.

===Rape by Agostino Tassi===

In 1611, Orazio was working with Agostino Tassi to decorate the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. One day in May, Tassi visited the Gentileschi household and, when alone with Artemisia, raped her. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, played a part in the rape. A female friend of Gentileschi, Tuzia, was present during the rape, but refused to help her.

With the expectation that they would marry in order to restore her virtue and secure her future, Artemisia started to have sexual relations with Tassi, but he reneged on his promise to marry her. Nine months after the rape, when he learned that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, her father Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. The major issue of the trial was the fact that Tassi had violated the Gentileschi family&#x27;s honor, and charges were not pressed for violating Artemisia.

During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio&#x27;s paintings. At the end of the trial, Tassi was exiled from Rome, although the sentence was never carried out. During the trial, Artemisia was tortured with a &#x27;sibille&#x27; (cords wrapped around the fingers and pulled tight) for the purpose of verifying her testimony. As the cords tighten, she is recorded as turning to Tassi and saying: &quot;This is the ring that you give me and these are your promises.&quot;

After her mother died, Artemisia had been surrounded mainly by males. When she was 17, Orazio rented the upstairs apartment of their home to a female tenant, Tuzia. Artemisia befriended Tuzia; however, Tuzia allowed Agostino Tassi and Cosimo Quorli to visit Artemisia in Artemisia&#x27;s home on multiple occasions. The day the rape occurred, Artemisia cried out to Tuzia for help, but Tuzia simply ignored Artemisia and pretended she knew nothing of what happened. Art historian Jeanne Morgan Zarucchi compared Tuzia&#x27;s betrayal and role in facilitating the rape to the role of a procuress who is complicit in the sexual exploitation of a prostitute.

A painting entitled &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, discovered in Crow&#x27;s Nest, Australia in 1976, may or may not have been painted by Gentileschi. On the presumption that it is her work, the baby has been interpreted as an indirect reference to Agostino Tassi, her rapist, as it dates to 1614, just two years after the rape. It depicts a strong and suffering woman and casts light on her anguish and expressive artistic capability.

===Florentine period (1612–1620)===

A month after the trial, Orazio arranged for his daughter to marry Pierantonio Stiattesi, a modest artist from Florence. Shortly afterward the couple moved to Florence. The six years she spent in Florence would be decisive both for Artemisia&#x27;s family life and professional career. Artemisia became a successful court painter, enjoying the patronage of the House of Medici, and playing a significant role in courtly culture of the city.

Artemisia&#x27;s career as an artist was very successful in Florence. She was the first woman accepted into the &quot;Accademia delle Arti del Disegno&quot; (Academy of the Arts of Drawing). She maintained good relations with the most respected artists of her time, such as Cristofano Allori, and was able to garner the favour and the protection of influential people, beginning with Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and especially of the Grand Duchess, Christina of Lorraine. Her acquaintance with Galileo Galilei, evident from a letter she wrote to the scientist in 1635, appears to stem from her Florentine years; indeed it may have stimulated her depiction of the compass in the &quot;Allegory of Inclination&quot;.

Her involvement in the courtly culture of Florence not only provided access to patrons, but it widened her education and exposure to the arts. She learned to read and write and became familiar with musical and theatrical performances. Such artistic spectacles helped Artemisia&#x27;s approach to depicting lavish clothing in her paintings: &quot;Artemisia understood that the representation of biblical or mythological figures in contemporary dress ... was an essential feature of the spectacle of courtly life.&quot;

In 1615, she received the attention of Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger (a great-nephew of Michelangelo). Busy with the construction of the Casa Buonarroti to celebrate his noted relative, he asked Artemisia —along with other Florentine artists, including Agostino Ciampelli, Sigismondo Coccapani, Giovan Battista Guidoni, and Zanobi Rosi — to contribute a painting for the ceiling. Artemisia was then in an advanced state of pregnancy. Each artist was commissioned to present an allegory of a virtue associated with Michelangelo, and Artemisia was assigned the &quot;Allegory of Inclination&quot;. In this instance, Artemisia was paid three times more than any other artist participating in the series. Artemisia painted her commission in the form of a nude young woman holding a compass. Her painting is located on the Galleria ceiling on the second floor. It is believed that the subject bears a resemblance to Artemisia. Indeed, in several of her paintings, Artemisia&#x27;s energetic heroines appear to be self-portraits.

Other significant works from this period include &quot;La Conversione della Maddalena&quot; (&quot;The Conversion of the Magdalene&quot;), &quot;Self-Portrait as a Lute Player&quot; (in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art), and &quot;Giuditta con la sua ancella&quot; (&quot;Judith and her Maidservant&quot;), now in the Palazzo Pitti. Artemisia painted a second version of &quot;Judith beheading Holofernes&quot;, which now is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence. Her first &quot;Judith Beheading Holofernes&quot; (1612–13), smaller in size, is displayed in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. In fact, she was fascinated with this subject and six variations of &quot;Judith Beheading Holofernes&quot; by Artemisia are known to exist.

While in Florence, Artemisia and Pierantonio had five children. Giovanni Battista, Agnola, and Lisabella did not survive for more than a year. Their second son, Cristofano, died at the age of five after Artemisia had returned to Rome. Only Prudentia survived into adulthood. Prudentia was also known as Palmira, which has led some scholars to conclude erroneously that Artemisia had a sixth child. Prudentia was named after Artemisia&#x27;s mother. It is known that Artemisia&#x27;s daughter was a painter and was trained by her mother, although nothing is known of her work.

In 2011, Francesco Solinas discovered a collection of 36 letters, dating from about 1616 to 1620, that add startling context to the personal and financial life of the Gentileschi family in Florence. They show that Artemisia had a passionate love affair with a wealthy Florentine nobleman, Francesco Maria Maringhi. Her husband, Pierantonio Stiattesi, was well aware of their relationship and he maintained a correspondence with Maringhi on the back of Artemisia&#x27;s love letters. He tolerated it, presumably because Maringhi was a powerful ally who provided the couple with financial support. However, by 1620, rumours of the affair had begun to spread in the Florentine court and this, combined with ongoing legal and financial problems, led the couple to relocate to Rome.

===Return to Rome (1620–1626/27)===

Just as with the preceding decade, the early 1620s saw ongoing upheaval in Artemisia Gentileschi&#x27;s life. Her son Cristofano died. Just as she arrived in Rome, her father Orazio departed for Genoa. Immediate contact with her lover Maringhi appeared to have lessened. By 1623, any mention of her husband disappears from any surviving documentation.

Her arrival in Rome offered the opportunity to cooperate with other painters and to seek patronage from the wide network of art collectors in the city, opportunities that Gentileschi grasped. One art historian noted of the period, &quot;Artemisia&#x27;s Roman career quickly took off, the money problems eased&quot;. Large-scale papal commissions were largely off-limits, however. The long papacy of Urban VIII showed a preference for large-scale decorative works and altarpieces, typified by the baroque style of Pietro da Cortona. Gentileschi&#x27;s training in easel paintings, and perhaps the suspicion that women painters did not have the energy to carry out large-scale painting cycles, meant that the ambitious patrons within Urban&#x27;s circle commissioned other artists.
But Rome hosted a wide range of patrons. Fernando Afan de Ribera, 3rd Duke of Alcala, a Spanish nobleman, acquired her &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot;, &quot;Christ Blessing the Children&quot;, and &quot;David with a Harp&quot;. During the same period she became associated with Cassiano dal Pozzo, a humanist and a collector and lover of arts. Dal Pozzo helped to forge relationships with other artists and patrons. Her reputation grew. The visiting French artist Pierre Dumonstier II produced a black and red chalk drawing of her right hand in 1625.

The variety of patrons in Rome also meant a variety of styles. Caravaggio&#x27;s style remained highly influential and converted many painters to following his style (the so-called &quot;Caravaggisti&quot;), such as Carlo Saraceni (who returned to Venice in 1620), Bartolomeo Manfredi, and Simon Vouet. Gentileschi and Vouet would go on to have a professional relationship and would influence each other&#x27;s styles. Vouet would go on to complete a portrait of Artemisia. Gentileschi also interacted with the Bentveughels group of Flemish and Dutch painters living in Rome. The Bolognese School (particularly during the 1621 to 1623 period of Gregory XV) also began to grow in popularity, and her &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; (1622) often is associated with the style introduced by Guercino.

Although it is sometimes difficult to date her paintings, it is possible to assign certain works by Gentileschi to these years, such as &quot;Portrait of a Gonfaloniere&quot;, today in Bologna (a rare example of her capacity as portrait painter), and &quot;Judith and Her Maidservant&quot;, today in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Detroit painting is notable for her mastery of chiaroscuro and tenebrism (the effects of extreme lights and darks), techniques for which Gerrit van Honthorst and many others in Rome were famous.

==== Three years in Venice (1626/27–1630) ====

The absence of sufficient documentation makes it difficult to follow Gentileschi&#x27;s movements in the late 1620s. However, it is certain that between 1626 and 1627, she moved to Venice, perhaps in search of richer commissions. Many verses and letters were composed in appreciation of her and her works in Venice. Knowledge of her commissions during the time is vague, but her &quot;The Sleeping Venus&quot;, today in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, and her &quot;Esther before Ahasuerus&quot;, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, are testaments to her assimilation of the lessons of Venetian colourism.

===Naples and the English period (1630–1656)===
In 1630, Artemisia moved to Naples, a city rich with workshops and art lovers, in search of new and more lucrative job opportunities. The 18th-century biographer Bernardo de&#x27; Dominici speculated that Artemisia was already known in Naples before her arrival. She may have been invited to Naples by the Duke of Alcalá, who had bought three of her paintings in Rome. Many other artists, including Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Simon Vouet, had stayed in Naples at some time in their lives. At that time, Jusepe de Ribera, Massimo Stanzione, and Domenichino were working there, and later, Giovanni Lanfranco and many other artists went to the city. The Neapolitan debut of Artemisia is represented by the &quot;Annunciation&quot; in the Capodimonte Museum. Painted shortly after her arrival in Naples, &quot;The Sleeping Christ Child&quot; is one of only three copper works by Artemisia known to exist, although she made small works on copper throughout her career.

With the exceptions of a brief trip to London and some other journeys, Artemisia resided in Naples for the remainder of her career.
On 18 March 1634, the traveller Bullen Reymes recorded in his diary visiting Artemisia and her daughter, Palmira (&#x27;who also paints&#x27;), with a group of fellow-Englishmen. She had relations with many renowned artists, among them Stanzione, with whom, Bernardo de&#x27; Dominici reports, she started an artistic collaboration based on a real friendship and artistic similarities. Artemisia&#x27;s work influenced Stanzione&#x27;s use of colours, as seen in his &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, c. 1630. De&#x27; Dominici states that &quot;Stanzione learned how to compose an &quot;istoria&quot; from Domenichino, but learned his coloring from Artemisia&quot;.

In Naples, Artemisia started working on paintings in a cathedral for the first time. They are dedicated to &quot;San Gennaro nell&#x27;anfiteatro di Pozzuoli&quot; (&quot;Saint Januarius in the amphitheater of Pozzuoli&quot;) in Pozzuoli. During her first Neapolitan period she painted the &quot;Birth of Saint John the Baptist&quot; now in the Prado in Madrid, and &quot;Corisca e il satiro&quot; (&quot;Corisca and the Satyr&quot;), today in a private collection. In these paintings, Artemisia again demonstrates her ability to adapt to the novelties of the period and to handle different subjects, instead of the usual &quot;Judith&quot;, &quot;Susanna&quot;, &quot;Bathsheba&quot;, and &quot;Penitent Magdalenes&quot;, for which she already was known. Many of these paintings were collaborations; &quot;Bathsheba&quot;, for instance, was attributed to Artemisia, Codazzi, and Gargiulo.

In 1638, Artemisia joined her father in London at the court of Charles I of England, where Orazio had become court painter and received the important job of decorating a ceiling allegory of &quot;Triumph of Peace and the Arts&quot; in the Queen&#x27;s House, Greenwich built for Queen Henrietta Maria. Father and daughter were working together once again, although helping her father probably was not her only reason for travelling to London: Charles I had invited her to his court. Charles I was an enthusiastic collector, willing to incur criticism for his spending on art. The fame of Artemisia probably intrigued him, and it is not a coincidence that his collection included a painting of great suggestion, the &quot;Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting&quot; (which is the lead image of this article).
Orazio died suddenly in 1639. Artemisia had her own commissions to fulfil after her father&#x27;s death, although there are no known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had left England by 1642, when the English Civil War was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.

In her last known years of activity she is attributed with works that are probably commissions and follow a traditional representation of the feminine in her works.

It was once believed that Artemisia died in 1652 or 1653; however, modern evidence has shown that she was still accepting commissions in 1654, although she was increasingly dependent upon her assistant, Onofrio Palumbo. Some have speculated that she died in the devastating plague that swept Naples in 1656 and virtually wiped out an entire generation of Neapolitan artists.

Some works in this period are the &quot;Susanna and the Elders&quot; (1622) today in Brno, the &quot;Virgin and Child with a Rosary&quot; today in El Escorial, the &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot; today in Columbus, Ohio, and the &quot;Bathsheba&quot; today in Leipzig.

Her &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot;, rediscovered in London in 2020, has been attributed by art historian Gianni Papi to Artemisia&#x27;s London period. Another work, &quot;Susanna And The Elders&quot;, previously owned by Charles I, was rediscovered in the Royal Collection in London in 2023.

==Artistic importance==
The research paper &quot;Gentileschi, padre e figlia&quot; (1916) by Roberto Longhi, an Italian critic, described Artemisia as &quot;the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, drawing, and other fundamentals&quot;. Longhi also wrote of &quot;Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot;: &quot;There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men&quot;. These include her works of &quot;Jael and Sisera&quot;, &quot;Judith and her Maidservant&quot;, and &quot;Esther&quot;. These characters intentionally lacked the stereotypical &quot;feminine&quot; traits—sensitivity, timidness, and weakness—and were courageous, rebellious, and powerful personalities (such subjects are now grouped under the name the Power of Women). A 19th-century critic commented on Artemisia&#x27;s &quot;Magdalene&quot; stating, &quot;no one would have imagined that it was the work of a woman. The brush work was bold and certain, and there was no sign of timidness&quot;. In Raymond Ward Bissell&#x27;s view, she was well aware of how women and female artists were viewed by men, explaining why her works were so bold and defiant in the beginning of her career.

Longhi wrote:

Feminist studies increased the interest in Artemisia Gentileschi, underlining her rape and subsequent mistreatment, and the expressive strength of her paintings of biblical heroines, in which the women are interpreted as willing to manifest their rebellion against their condition. In a research paper from the catalogue of the exhibition &quot;Orazio e Artemisia Gentileschi&quot;, which took place in Rome in 2001 (and after in New York), Judith W. Mann critiques feminist opinion of Artemisia, finding that old stereotypes of Artemisia as sexually immoral have been replaced by new stereotypes established in feminist readings of Artemisia&#x27;s paintings:

Because Artemisia returned again and again to violent subject matter such as Judith and Holofernes, a repressed-vengeance theory has been postulated by some art historians, but other art historians suggest that she was shrewdly taking advantage of her fame from the rape trial to cater to a niche market in sexually charged, female-dominated art for male patrons.
The most recent critics, starting from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, have tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it in the context of the different artistic environments in which the painter participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination—using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities—against the prejudices expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that probably were more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.

==Feminist perspectives==
Feminist interest in Artemisia Gentileschi dates from the 1970s when the feminist art historian Linda Nochlin published an article entitled &quot;Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?&quot; in which that question was dissected and analysed. The article explores the definition of &quot;great artists&quot; and posited that oppressive institutions, not lack of talent, have prevented women from achieving the same level of recognition that men received in art and other fields. Nochlin said that studies on Artemisia and other women artists were &quot;worth the effort&quot; in &quot;adding to our knowledge of women&#x27;s achievement and of art history generally&quot;. According to the foreword by Douglas Druick in Eve Straussman-Pflanzer&#x27;s &quot;Violence &amp; Virtue: Artemisia&#x27;s Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot;, Nochlin&#x27;s article prompted scholars to make more of an attempt to &quot;integrate women artists into the history of art and culture&quot;.
Artemisia and her oeuvre became a focus again, having had little attention in art history scholarship save Roberto Longhi&#x27;s article &quot;Gentileschi padre e figlia (Gentileschi, father and daughter)&quot; in 1916 and Bissell&#x27;s article &quot;Artemisia Gentileschi—A New Documented Chronology&quot; in 1968. As Artemisia and her work began to garner new attention among art historians and feminists, more literature about her, fictional and biographical, was published. A fictional account of her life by Anna Banti, wife of critic Roberto Longhi, was published in 1947. This account was well received by literary critics, but was criticized by feminists, notably Laura Benedetti, for being lenient in historical accuracy in order to draw parallels between author and artist. The first full, factual account of Artemisia&#x27;s life, &quot;The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art&quot;, was published in 1989 by Mary Garrard, a feminist art historian. She then published a second, smaller book entitled &quot;Artemisia Gentileschi around 1622: The Shaping and Reshaping of an Artistic Identity&quot; in 2001 that explored the artist&#x27;s work and identity. Garrard noted that analysis of Artemisia&#x27;s oeuvre lacks focus and stable categorization outside of &quot;woman&quot;, although Garrard questions whether femaleness is a legitimate category by which to judge her art at all.

Artemisia is known for her portrayals of subjects from the Power of Women group, for example her versions of &quot;Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot;. She is also known for the rape trial in which she was involved, which scholar Griselda Pollock has argued had unfortunately become the repeated &quot;axis of interpretation of the artist&#x27;s work&quot;. Gentileschi&#x27;s status in popular culture is deemed by Pollock to be due less to her work than to the sensationalism caused by the persistent focus on the rape trial during which she was tortured. Pollock offers a counter reading of the artist&#x27;s dramatic narrative paintings, refusing to see the Judith and Holofernes images as responses to rape and the trial. Instead, Pollock points out that the subject of Judith and Holofernes is not a revenge theme, but a story of political courage and indeed, collaboration by two women committing a daring political murder in a war situation. Pollock seeks to shift attention from sensationalism toward deeper analysis of Gentileschi&#x27;s paintings, notably of death and loss, suggesting the significance of her childhood bereavement as a source of her singular images of the dying Cleopatra. Pollock also argues that Gentileschi&#x27;s success in the 17th century depended on her producing paintings for patrons, often portraying subjects they selected that reflected contemporary tastes and fashions. She aims to place Gentileschi&#x27;s career in its historical context of taste for dramatic narratives of heroines from the Bible or classical sources.
In another vein entirely, American professor Camille Paglia has argued that modern feminist preoccupation with Artemisia is misguided and that her accomplishments have been overstated: &quot;Artemisia Gentileschi was simply a polished, competent painter in a Baroque style created by men.&quot; Nonetheless, according to The National Gallery, Artemisia worked &quot;in Rome, Florence, Venice, Naples, and London, for the highest echelons of European society, including the Grand Duke of Tuscany and Philip IV of Spain&quot;.

Feminist literature tends to revolve around the event of Artemisia&#x27;s rape, largely portraying her as a traumatised, but noble survivor whose work became characterised by sex and violence as a result of her experience. interpreted the film by Agnès Merlet as a typical example of the inability of popular culture to look at the painter&#x27;s remarkable career over many decades and in many major centres of art, rather than this one episode. A literature review by Laura Benedetti, &quot;Reconstructing Artemisia: Twentieth Century Images of a Woman Artist&quot;, concluded that Artemisia&#x27;s work is often interpreted according to the contemporary issues and personal biases of the authors. Feminist scholars, for example, have elevated Artemisia to the status of feminist icon, which Benedetti attributed to Artemisia&#x27;s paintings of formidable women and her success as an artist in a male-dominated field while also being a single mother. Elena Ciletti, author of &quot;Gran Macchina a Bellezza&quot;, wrote that &quot;The stakes are very high in Artemisia&#x27;s case, especially for feminists, because we have invested in her so much of our quest for justice for women, historically and currently, intellectually and politically.&quot;

Feminist scholars suggest that Artemisia wanted to take a stand against the stereotype of female submissiveness. One example of this symbolism appears in her &quot;Corisca and the Satyr&quot;, created between 1630 and 1635. In the painting, a nymph runs away from a satyr. The satyr attempts to grab the nymph by her hair, but the hair is a wig. Here, Artemisia depicts the nymph to be quite clever and to be actively resisting the aggressive attack of the satyr.

==Other female painters of her time==

For a woman at the beginning of the 17th century, Artemisia being a painter represented an uncommon and difficult choice, but not an exceptional one. Artemisia was aware of &quot;her position as a female artist and the current representations of women&#x27;s relationship to art&quot;. This is evident in her allegorical self portrait, &quot;Self Portrait as &quot;La Pittura&quot;&quot;, which shows Artemisia as a muse, &quot;symbolic embodiment of the art&quot; and as a professional artist.

Before Artemisia, between the end of the 1500s and the beginning of 1600s, other women painters had successful careers, including Sofonisba Anguissola (born in Cremona around 1530). Later Fede Galizia (born in Milan or Trento in 1578) painted still lifes, and a &quot;Judith with the Head of Holofernes&quot;.

Italian Baroque painter Elisabetta Sirani was another female artist from this same period. Sirani&#x27;s painting &quot;Allegory Painting of Clio&quot; shares a common colour scheme with Artemisia&#x27;s work. Elisabetta gained considerable success before her death aged 27.
==In popular culture==

=== In novels and fiction ===

* The first writer who produced a novel around the figure of Artemisia may have been George Eliot in &quot;Romola&quot; (1862–63), where some aspects of Artemisia&#x27;s story, while set in the Florence in her time, are recognisable, but much embroidered.
* A later and clearer use of Artemisia&#x27;s story appears in Anna Banti&#x27;s &quot;Artemisia&quot;. Banti&#x27;s book is written in an &quot;open diary&quot; format, in which she maintains a dialogue with Artemisia.

Prince Philip, seeing the painting, asks Sir Anthony Blunt who the artist is, Blunt replies &#x27;Artemisia Gentileschi&#x27;, to which Philip says &#x27;Never heard of him&#x27;. &#x27;Her, sir&#x27;, Blunt corrects him.
* Artemisia Gentileschi&#x27;s life, her rape, and her &quot;Judith Slaying Holofernes&quot; painting are referenced in Episodes 3 &amp; 4 (&quot;A Murderous Party&quot;) of the French detective series &quot;L&#x27;art du crime&quot;, starring Nicolas Gob. Blandine Bury stars as Artemisia Gentileschi.

=== In other artworks ===
* Artemisia Gentileschi is one of the women represented in &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, an installation artwork by Judy Chicago that was first exhibited in 1979.

=== In cinema ===
* The film &quot;Artemisia&quot; (1997), by Agnès Merlet, tells the story of Artemisia&#x27;s entry into being a professional artist, her relationship with Tassi, and the trial. Merlet exonerates Tassi of rape, however, not only by depicting their sex as loving and consensual (which was controversial when the film was released), but also by two ahistorical fabrications: Artemisia refuses under torture to say that she was raped, while Tassi falsely confesses to rape to stop Artemisia&#x27;s torment.
* In 2020 the documentary film &quot;Artemisia Gentileschi, Warrior Painter&quot;, directed by Jordan River, was produced.

<doc id="774548" wikidata="Q907052" url="?curid=774548" title="Shuri Castle">
<text>is a Ryukyuan &quot;gusuku&quot; castle in Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Between 1429 and 1879, it was the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom, before becoming largely neglected. In 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, it was almost completely destroyed.

After the war, the castle was re-purposed as a university campus. Beginning in 1992, the central citadel and walls were largely reconstructed on the original site based on historical records, photographs, and memory. In 2000, Shuri Castle was designated as a World Heritage Site, as a part of the Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu.

On the morning of 31 October 2019, the main courtyard structures of the castle were again destroyed in a fire. Reconstruction is ongoing and is expected to be fully completed by the autumn of 2026.

==History==

The date of construction is uncertain, but it was clearly in use as a castle during the Sanzan period (1322–1429). It is thought that it was probably built during the Gusuku period, like many other castles of Okinawa. When King Shō Hashi unified the three principalities of Okinawa and established the Ryukyu Kingdom, he used Shuri as a residence. At the same time, Shuri flourished as the capital and continued to do so during the Second Shō dynasty.

For 450 years from 1429, it was the royal court and administrative center of the Ryukyu Kingdom. It was the focal point of foreign trade, as well as the political, economic, and cultural heart of the Ryukyu Islands. According to records, the castle burned down several times, and rebuilt each time. During the reign of Shō Nei, samurai forces from the Japanese feudal domain of Satsuma seized Shuri on 6 May 1609. The Japanese withdrew soon afterwards, returning Shō Nei to his throne two years later, and the castle and city to the Ryukyuans, though the kingdom was now a vassal state under Satsuma&#x27;s suzerainty and would remain so for roughly 250 years.

===Decline===
In the 1850s, Commodore Matthew C. Perry twice forced his way into Shuri Castle, but was denied an audience with the king both times. In 1879, the kingdom was annexed by the Empire of Japan and the last king, Shō Tai, was compelled to move to Tokyo, and in 1884, he was “elevated” to the rank of marquess in the Japanese aristocracy. Subsequently, the castle was used as a barracks by the Imperial Japanese Army. The Japanese garrison withdrew in 1896, but not before having created a series of tunnels and caverns below it.

In 1908, Shuri City bought the castle from the Japanese government; however, it did not have funding to renovate it. In 1923, thanks to Japanese architect Ito Chuta, &quot;Seiden&quot; survived demolition after being re-designated a prefectural Shinto shrine known as Okinawa Shrine. In 1925, it was designated as a national treasure. Despite its decline, historian George H. Kerr described the castle as &quot;one of the most magnificent castle sites to be found anywhere in the world, for it commands the countryside below for miles around and looks toward distant sea horizons on every side.&quot;

===World War II===

During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army had set up its headquarters in the castle underground, and by early 1945 had established complex lines of defense and communications in the regions around Shuri, and across the southern part of the island as a whole. The Japanese defenses, centered on Shuri Castle, held off the massive American assault from 1 April through the month of May 1945. Beginning on 25 May, and as the final part of the Okinawa campaign, the American battleship &quot;Mississippi&quot; shelled it for three days and by 27 May it was ablaze. The Japanese retreated during the night, abandoning Shuri, while the US forces continued to pursue them south. US Marine and Army units secured the castle against little resistance. On 29 May, Maj. Gen. Pedro del Valle—commanding the 1st Marine Division—ordered Captain Julian D. Dusenbury of Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines to capture the castle, which represented both strategic and psychological blows for the Japanese and was a milestone in the campaign.

===Post-war===
After the war, the University of the Ryukyus was established in 1950 on the castle site, where it remained until 1975. In 1958, &quot;Shureimon&quot; was reconstructed and, starting from 1992, the 20th anniversary of reversion, the main buildings and surrounding walls of the central castle were reconstructed. At present, the entire area around the castle has been established as &quot;Shuri Castle Park&quot;. In 2000, along with other &quot;gusuku&quot; and related sites, it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, only remnants such as stone walls and building foundations extant before 1950 are officially designated as World Heritage. In addition, 2000 saw the Shureimon gate at Shuri Castle featured on the new 2000 yen note, which entered circulation to commemorate the new millennium and the 26th G8 summit, which was held in Okinawa.

===2019 fire===
In the morning of 31 October 2019, a large fire broke out and burned down the &quot;Seiden&quot;, the main hall, and also the &quot;Hokuden&quot; and &quot;Nanden&quot;, adjacent buildings to the north and south. A security alarm went off around 2:30 a.m., and a call to emergency services was placed around 10 minutes later. The &quot;Seiden&quot;, &quot;Hokuden&quot;, &quot;Nanden&quot; and &quot;Bandokoro&quot; were completely destroyed. According to domestic news sources, &quot;Six castle buildings occupying some in total were gutted.&quot; The fire was put out around 1:30 p.m.

Okinawa Police later told domestic broadcaster NHK that a security guard who checked on the alarm found that the main entrance doors to the &quot;Seiden&quot; were closed. When the guard unlocked the shutter and went inside, the interior was already filled with smoke. After police initially ruled out arson, authorities said that the fire was likely caused by an electrical fault after a burned electrical distribution board was found in the northeast side of where the &quot;Seiden&quot; had stood. Police investigations later revealed that the lighting panel had no signs of short circuiting, though a surveillance camera did capture flashing light in the &quot;Seiden&quot; main hall shortly before and after the fire.

The fire was the fifth time that Shuri Castle has been destroyed following previous incidents in 1453, 1660, 1709 and 1945. Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki said after the fire that Shuri Castle is &quot;a symbol of the Ryukyu Kingdom, an expression of its history and culture&quot;, and has vowed to rebuild it. Japan&#x27;s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Shuri Castle is &quot;an extremely important symbol of Okinawa&quot;. The Japanese Government is considering supplemental appropriations to support restoration work. UNESCO also said it would be ready to assist with Shuri Castle&#x27;s reconstruction. A crowdfunding campaign set up by Naha City officials for the rebuilding of Shuri Castle had received over $3.2 million in donations as of 6 November 2019.

Rebuilding efforts to restore the destroyed sections of Shuri Castle began in February 2020. Restoration of the roof tiles began in July 2024, and at that time it was expected that the renovations would be fully completed by the autumn of 2026.

In May 2021, a scale replica of the castle measuring one twenty fifth of the size of the actual structure was recreated at the Tobu World Square theme park in Kinugawa Onsen.

==Construction==

Unlike Japanese castles, Shuri Castle was greatly influenced by Chinese architecture, with functional and decorative elements similar to that seen primarily in the Forbidden City. The gates and various buildings were painted in red with lacquer, walls and eaves colorfully decorated, and roof tiles made of Goryeo and later red Ryukyuan tiles, and the decoration of each part heavily using the king&#x27;s dragon. Given that the &quot;Nanden&quot; and &quot;Bandokoro&quot; were both used for reception and entertainment of the Satsuma clan, a Japanese style design was used here only.

Ryukyuan elements also dominate. Like other &quot;gusuku&quot;, the castle was built using Ryukyuan limestone, being surrounded by an outer shell which was built during the Second Shō dynasty from the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 16th century. Similarly, &quot;Okushoin-en&quot; is the only surviving garden in a &quot;gusuku&quot; in the Ryukyu Islands, which made use of the limestone bedrock and arranged using local cycads.

The current renovation is designed with a focus on the castle&#x27;s role as a cultural or administrative/political center, rather than one for military purposes. The buildings that had been restored as original wooden buildings (and subsequently destroyed in the 2019 fire) were only in the main citadel. The &quot;Seiden&quot; was rebuilt using wood from Taiwan and elsewhere after rituals blessing the removal of large trees from mountains in the Yanbaru region of Okinawa took place. Other buildings, such as the &quot;Nanden&quot; or &quot;Hokuden&quot; were only restored as facades, with interiors made using modern materials such as steel and concrete. Old walls remain in part, and were excavated and incorporated during the construction of the new castle wall, forming the only surviving external remains of the original castle.

==Sites of interest==

Due to its central role in Ryukyuan political and religious life, Shuri is composed of and surrounded by various sites of historical interest. The castle complex itself can be divided into three main zones, namely a central administrative area (including the &quot;Seidan&quot; and &quot;Ura&quot;), an eastern living and ceremonial space (behind the &quot;Seidan&quot;) called the &quot;Ouchibara&quot; (literally &quot;inside field&quot;), and a southwestern ceremonial area including the &quot;Kyo-no-uchi&quot; (literally &quot;inside capital&quot;).

===Buildings===
All of the buildings located at Shurijo are modern reconstructions, the originals being lost in 1945.
* – located south of the &quot;Una&quot;, and paired with the &quot;Nanden&quot;, originally the main reception area, currently housing a museum. The two were built between 1621 and 1627.
* or – the &quot;North Hall&quot;, located north of the &quot;Una&quot;, originally a judicial and administrative center where &quot;Sapposhi&quot; (Chinese envoys) were also received, currently housing a museum and gift-shop.

==Ceremonies==
===Religious===

Shurijo operated not only as a base of political and military control, it was also regarded as a central religious sanctuary of the Ryukyuan people. Formerly there were 10 &quot;utaki&quot; (shrines) within the castle and the large area on the south-western side of the citadel was occupied by a sanctuary called &quot;Kyo-no-uchi&quot;. This was a place where natural elements, such as trees and natural limestone rocks were utilized. Although &quot;Noro&quot; (priestesses) carried out a number of nature rituals (as also sometimes occurs in Shinto), the contents of the rituals and the layout of the inner part of the sacred areas remain unclear. After the war, limited religious observance continued on the site, mostly with the placement of incense sticks on places formerly considered sacred. However, restoration of the castle stopped general access to these sites, and for this reason, &quot;Shuri Castle was resurrected, but it was destroyed as a place of worship&quot;.

===Investiture===

Contacts between the Ryukyu Islands and China began in 1372 and lasted five centuries until the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. When a new king commenced, the Emperor of China sent officials to attend the investiture ceremony at the castle. Through this ceremony, the kingdom reiterated its ties with China, both politically, commercially, and culturally. This custom also granted the new monarch official international recognition within east Asia.

The Chinese delegation included about 500 people, including a &quot;Sapposhi&quot; (ambassador) and a representative, both appointed by senior officials of the emperor. The envoys departed from Beijing and proceeded by land to Fuzhou in Fujian Province, where they sailed to the Ryukyu Islands, sometimes via Kumejima, on &quot;Ukanshin&quot; (&quot;Crown Ships&quot;).

Among the first tasks of the Chinese delegation was a &quot;Yusa&quot; (religious ceremony) in memory of the late king. Words of condolence from the emperor were spoken in &quot;Sōgen-ji&quot; in Naha, and (after 1799) envoys were then received in &quot;Shikina-en&quot;. Then the investiture ceremony took place in the &quot;Una&quot;, where two platforms were erected between the &quot;Nanden&quot; and &quot;Seiden&quot;, called &quot;Kettei&quot;, reserved for the envoys, and &quot;Sendokudai&quot;. The imperial official recited the formula for the appointment of the new king and bowed deeply.

Later, inside the castle, there was a &quot;Feast of Investiture,&quot; followed by a &quot;Mid-autumn Banquet&quot;, accompanied by songs and dances. This banquet was held on a temporary platform opposite the &quot;Hokuden&quot;, a platform on which the Imperial envoys stood. On the shore of &quot;Ryutan&quot; and in the castle, the &quot;Choyo Banquet&quot;, during which a boat race and musical performances took place, was also held in the presence of the delegation. Two successive farewell banquets were then held opposite &quot;Hokuden&quot;, and finally a banquet at &quot;Tenshikan&quot;, where the king gave the Chinese delegation gold presents as an august sign for their return.

<doc id="774551" wikidata="Q814731" url="?curid=774551" title="Beijing Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program">
<text>The Beijing Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program (SCAP) was an astronomical survey to search for near-Earth objects. It was conducted during the 1990s, at the Xinglong Station in Xinglong County, Chengde, Hebei province, China and resulted in the discovery of more than a thousand numbered minor planets.

Funded by the Chinese Academy of Science, the survey is sometimes also called BAO Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program and NAOC Schmidt CCD Asteroid Program, referring to the Beijing Astronomical Observatory (BAO) and National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC), respectively.

The instrument that SCAP used to detect near-Earth objects was a 60/90 cm Schmidt telescope. Equipped with a 2048×2048 CCD camera, this telescope was installed at the BAO Xinglong station in Hebei province, China.

In a conversation with Space.com contributor Michael Paine, SCAP head Jin Zhu said that the program&#x27;s allotted time to use the Schmidt telescope was significantly reduced to make room for the observatory&#x27;s other projects.

== Discoveries ==
From 1995 to 1999, SCAP detected one new comet and 2460 new asteroids and observed 43860 other asteroids, making it the fifth largest asteroid observation project at that time. Five of the asteroids it discovered were NEAs, two of which were considered potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). In 2002, an NEA was discovered near Earth&#x27;s moon.

<text>The &quot;letter of the eight&quot; was an open letter, jointly signed by the prime ministers of five of the then fifteen members of the European Union together with three high representatives for the Central European countries that were to enter the union in 2004, published in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; of London, and other international newspapers on 30 January 2003 under the title &quot;Europe and America Must Stand United&quot;. It expressed indirect support for United States ambition of a régime change in Iraq in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. To most observers it demonstrated a total division within the EU in respect to foreign policy and attitudes towards international law. 

The letter was &quot;conceived of and commissioned&quot; by Mike Gonzalez, at the time a senior editor for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s Europe edition. 

The letter, from the leaders of Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, accused Saddam Hussein of continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction and urged the UN Security Council to act against that threat. The statement&#x27;s content was not controversial, as it said that Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to violate UN resolutions, but the exclusion of ten of EU&#x27;s 15 members was interpreted as a signal of deep division and the difficulty of implementing the EU&#x27;s Common Foreign and Security Policy.

The letter was on 6 February followed by the Vilnius letter, a more outspoken declaration of support for the position of the United States from the Vilnius Group composed of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, North Macedonia, Romania, and a member of the UN Security Council, Bulgaria.

<text>Justin Grant Huish (born January 9, 1975, in Fountain Valley, California) is an American double Olympic champion in Archery, titles he won at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Known for his unorthodox character sporting wrap-around shades, backwards baseball cap, ponytail and an earring, Huish captivated the crowd by winning a gold medal in the individual and team events. In the individual, Huish ranked no higher than 24th in the world at the time but rose to the occasion and saw off Sweden&#x27;s Magnus Pettersson 112–107 in the final. Huish was the first male archer to win double gold medals and his wins led to a popularity boost for the sport. His feat was matched by South Korea&#x27;s Ku Bon-chan in the 2016 Summer Olympics and Kim Woo-jin in the 2024 Summer Olympics. He was later credited for encouraging actress Geena Davis to pick up the sport.

As a ninth-grader he was into skateboarding, lived on a street called Broken Arrow, and thought archery was boring. But when Huish&#x27;s parents opened Arrowsmith Archery, he wanted a job. He didn&#x27;t pick up the sport until age 14 and would practice standing in the middle of the street, shooting arrows through the front door of his garage, through the back door of his garage, and into a target in his backyard. Only three years after taking up a bow, 17-year-old Justin Huish won the intermediate age division at the National Archery Assn.&#x27;s Outdoor Target Championships, significant victories at the 1993 US collegiate championships and the 1995 US Target Championships. He had only been on the US National Team since 1994. 

Justin Huish qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics, but withdrew later that year.

<text>Maironis (born Jonas Mačiulis, ; – 28 June 1932) was a Lithuanian Roman Catholic priest and the greatest and most-known Lithuanian poet, especially of the period of the Lithuanian press ban. He was called the Bard of Lithuanian National Revival (). Maironis was active in public life. However, the Lithuanian literary historian Juozas Brazaitis writes that Maironis was not. 

In his poetry, he expressed the national aspirations of the Lithuanian National Revival and was highly influential in Lithuanian society and poetry. The Maironian school in Lithuanian literature was named after him.

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
Jonas Mačiulis was born on in manor, , , in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was almost wholly annexed by the Russian Empire during the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Maironis&#x27; parents were free peasants who maintained close relations with the polonized Lithuanian nobility. Such a social environment formed the basis of Maironis&#x27; personality, leading to his deep religiosity and loyalty to tradition, free from atheistic or liberal influences. Socially, Maironis was uninvolved in the tensions between nobles and peasants, the rich and the poor, and did not become a representative of either side. Maironis was raised with a firm grounding in Lithuanian rural culture and was open to influence of any culture provided that it did not contradict Maironis&#x27; love for his land, his people, its past and traditions.

=== Ecclesiastical and academic career ===
During 1873–1883, Maironis was learning in the gymnasium of Kaunas. In sixth class, he began writing verses in Polish. In 1883, he entered the Kiev University to study literature. He only studied there for a single semester. He left the university after the lectures did not satisfy his hopes and the students&#x27; stances towards religion were strange to him, so, Maironis returned to Kaunas in 1884 and entered Kaunas Priest Seminary. Maironis studied in the seminary until 1888. In the seminary, Lithuanian culture and the use of the Lithuanian language were encouraged by the priest, then Auxiliary bishop, Antanas Baranauskas. This influenced Maironis to decide in favour of Lithuanianness and to create art in the Lithuanian language, thus leading to him being important in the Lithuanian National Revival.

In 1888-1892, Maironis studied in the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy, where he mostly studied moral theology and for his work , he received a Master&#x27;s degree. In 1891, Maironis was ordained a priest. From 1892 to 1894, he was professor in Kaunas Priest Seminary, where he taught the dogmatic theology and catechism. 

==== In Saint Petersburg ====

From 1894 to 1909, he was Theology Professor in Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy and was made the academic inspector in 1900. For a few years, he was also the prefect and spiritual father. In 1903, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. In the Academy, the Department of Sociology was established at the insistence of Maironis. Around 1900, Maironis was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Language Rights&#x27; Restoration Union ().

Maironis&#x27; presence in academia had indirect influence on Lithuanian culture in Saint Petersburg, as the presence of a Lithuanian poet in the functions of an inspector raised patriotic pride amongst the Lithuanian students and allowed the entry of more Lithuanians into professorship. Moreover, this allowed Maironis to authoritatively support the works of Lithuanians in the Imperial Russian capital, for example, the Lithuanian newspaper &quot;Lietuvių laikraštis&quot; of . This newspaper was the first legally-printed Lithuanian newspaper in the Russian Empire following the end of Lithuanian press ban in 1904. In 1905, Maironis was a member of the Commission formed by the Minister of Education of the Russian Empire to prepare a Lithuanian language program for Lithuanian schools. Together with others, he prepared a draft program of the Christian Democratic Party for the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905.

==== In Lithuania ====
From 1908, Maironis was member of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in Vilnius. In 1909, he was invited as rector of the Kaunas Priest Seminary. In his first public speech, he spoke in Lithuanian, breaking with the tradition of speaking either in Latin or Polish. This was a breakthrough moment for Lithuanianness in the seminary. Outside of the seminary, Maironis was important to show that Lithuanians had their own intellectual high ecclesiastical figures, as Maironis was Mogilev&#x27;s honorary canon since 1902 and later also the prelate of the Samogitian Capitula from 1912. He aided Roman Catholic Lithuanian cultural organisations by allowing them to establish their headquarters in the former , which Maironis had bought. Maironis remained the seminary&#x27;s rector until his death in 1932, except when the seminary was closed during World War I. Maironis left Kaunas only during short breaks during summer when he went to Palanga or when the seminary was closed during World War I. 

=== World War I ===
During the First World War, Maironis lived in several places such as Krekenava, Upytė and others. He was persuaded to travel with the Lithuanian delegation to the Conference of Bern in 1917, which was one of the Lithuanian conferences during World War I. 

=== Interwar ===

Maironis was rejoicing at the re-establishment of Lithuanian independence, but he was disappointed with certain social ills he witnessed with the rebellious wave following independence. He disapproved of the Interwar as it was contrary to his social conservativism. In this respect, the &quot;Tautininkai&quot; were closer to him than the Christian Democrats. His political leanings were partly also because of personal relations. While avoiding the public spotlight, Maironis preferred to frequent the intellectual artist circles, where poetry, song and music predominated. 

In 1922, Maironis was elected the Professor of Moral Theology in the Faculty of Theology-Philosophy of the newly-founded University of Lithuania. For a short time, he taught courses on general and Lithuanian literature. The students were impressed by the clarity and simplicity of the teaching, looking at the substance of the question rather than the rhetoric. Later that year, Maironis was elected the honorary professor of the University of Lithuania on 15 December 1922. A decade later, the same institution gave him the degree of honorary doctor of literature on 29 January 1932.

== Works ==
Maironis wrote numerous poems. Some of them are contained in his most famous collection of poems, (The Voices of Spring). Maironis&#x27;s works also include: poems &quot;Lietuva&quot; (1888), &quot;Tarp skausmų do garbę&quot; (1893), &quot;Znad Biruty&quot; (1904), &quot;Jaunoji Lietuva&quot; (1907), &quot;Raseinių Magdė&quot; (1909), &quot;Naše vargai&quot; (1913), three historical dramas: &quot;Kęstučio mirtis&quot; (1921), &quot;Vytautas pas kryžiuočius&quot; (1925), &quot;Didysis Vytautas - Karalius&quot; (1930), as well as works from the fields of theology, history (&quot;Apsakymai apie Lietuvos praeiga&quot;, 1886), sociology, literature and journalistic texts. &quot;Znad Biruty&quot; is the only surviving work by Maironis written in Polish.

== Death and legacy ==

He died in Kaunas in 1932, aged 69. He was buried in a tomb monument constructed outside the Kaunas Cathedral Basilica. He personally chose the sentence on his tomb (&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;How sorry I am for that white grandfather ...&quot;) from his poem .
His former house in Kaunas is now the Maironis Lithuanian Literature Museum.

<text>Emmett Evan &quot;Van&quot; Heflin Jr. (December 13, 1908 – July 23, 1971) was an American theatre, radio, and film actor. He played mostly character parts over the course of his film career, but during the 1940s had a string of roles as a leading man. Heflin won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1942). He also had memorable roles in the westerns &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957), and &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1958). He portrayed a mentally disturbed airline passenger in the classic disaster film &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), his final screen appearance.

==Early life==
Heflin was born in Walters, Oklahoma, the son of Fanny Bleecker (née Shippey) and Dr. Emmett Evan Heflin, a dentist. He was of Irish and French ancestry. Heflin&#x27;s sister was Daytime Emmy-nominated actress Frances Heflin (who married composer Sol Kaplan). Heflin attended Classen High School in Oklahoma City. One source says Long Beach Polytechnic High School. He also went to the University of Oklahoma, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1932, and was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in theater at Yale University. 

Prior to his acting career, Heflin was an accomplished seaman.

==Career==
===Broadway===
Heflin began his acting career on Broadway in the late 1920s. He appeared in &quot;Mr. Moneypenny&quot; (1928), &quot;The Bride of Torozko&quot; (1934), &quot;The Night Remembers&quot; (1934), &quot;Mid-West&quot; (1936), and &quot;End of Summer&quot; (1936). After this, Katharine Hepburn helped him secure a film contract with RKO Radio Pictures and he did a screen test in New York.

===RKO===
Heflin made his film debut in &quot;A Woman Rebels&quot; (1936), opposite Katharine Hepburn, whom he played opposite in the stage version of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. He followed it with &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; (1937), billed third after Preston Foster and Jean Muir, and &quot;Flight from Glory&quot; (1937), a Chester Morris programmer where Heflin played an alcoholic pilot.

Heflin was in &quot;Annapolis Salute&quot; (1937), then was given his first lead role in &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1937), playing a star quarterback.

Heflin returned to Broadway for &quot;Western Waters&quot; (1937–38) and &quot;Casey Jones&quot; (1938), the latter for the Group Theatre and directed by Elia Kazan.

In Hollywood Heflin had a support role in &quot;Back Door to Heaven&quot; (1939). He returned to Broadway where he played Macaulay Connor opposite Katharine Hepburn, Joseph Cotten and Shirley Booth in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, which ran for 417 performances from 1939 to 1940. It led to Heflin being offered a choice character part in the Errol Flynn western &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940) at Warners, playing a villainous gun seller. The movie was a big hit.

===MGM===
Not being &quot;swamped with offers&quot; after &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, Heflin contacted Billy Grady, an MGM talent scout, and arranged for a screen test, which Heflin did opposite Donna Reed. He received a stock deal from MGM, which initially cast Heflin in supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Feminine Touch&quot; (1941) and &quot;H.M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941).

He had a part as Robert Taylor&#x27;s doomed best friend in &quot;Johnny Eager&quot; (1942), which won Heflin an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and was a box office success.

====Stardom====

MGM began to groom Heflin as a leading man in B movies, giving him the star role in &quot;Kid Glove Killer&quot; (1942), directed by Fred Zinnemann, and &quot;Grand Central Murder&quot; (1942). Both were popular.

Encouraged, MGM cast him as Kathryn Grayson&#x27;s love interest in a musical, &quot;Seven Sweethearts&quot; (1942), then was given the star role in an &quot;A&quot; film, as the embattled President Andrew Johnson in &quot;Tennessee Johnson&quot; (1942), playing opposite (and at odds with) Lionel Barrymore who, in the role of Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, failed to have Johnson convicted in an impeachment trial by the slimmest of margins. The film was a box office flop.

Heflin was Judy Garland&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Presenting Lily Mars&quot; (1943); then, he enlisted in the Army. 

Heflin served initially in the field artillery. After recuperating from injuries incurred during training, he was transferred to the Ninth Air Force as combat photographer, flying over France and Germany, before joining, with many other actors, the First Motion Picture Unit.
 He first appeared in the training film &quot;Land and Live in the Jungle&quot; (1944) and then in three more films.

When Heflin returned to Hollywood, MGM lent him to Hal Wallis to star opposite Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946). He was in the all-star musical &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946) then was loaned to Warner Bros to co star with Joan Crawford in &quot;Possessed&quot; (1947).

Back at MGM he co-starred with Lana Turner in &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot; (1947), a big prestige film for the studio and their biggest hit of 1947. He was reunited with Stanwyck in &quot;B.F.&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1948) and was loaned to Walter Wanger for &quot;Tap Roots&quot; (1948), where he was top billed; both lost money.

MGM cast him as Athos in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948), a huge success. He was top-billed in Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;Act of Violence&quot; (1949), and supported Jennifer Jones in &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1949). Both movies were acclaimed but lost money. He then made a third film with Stanwyck, &quot;East Side, West Side&quot; (1950), but he was now billed beneath James Mason. While that production did not lose money, it only netted a small profit for the studio.

===Radio===
&quot;The Adventures of Philip Marlowe&quot; was a radio detective drama that aired from June 17, 1947, through September 15, 1951, first heard on NBC in the summer of 1947 starring Van Heflin (June 12, 1947 – September 9, 1947). He also acted on the &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; and many more radio programs.

===Leaving MGM===
Heflin began appearing on television on episodes of &quot;Nash Airflyte Theatre&quot; and &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;).

Heflin had the lead role in a Western at Universal, &quot;Tomahawk&quot; (1951) and starred in a thriller directed by Joseph Losey, &quot;The Prowler&quot; (1951).

At Universal he made a family comedy with Patricia Neal, &quot;Week-End with Father&quot; (1951), then he was an FBI man in Leo McCarey&#x27;s anti-Communist &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952).

Heflin went to England to star in &quot;South of Algiers&quot; (1953). He appeared in a huge success as the honest farmer in &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) with Alan Ladd.

However he followed it up with action films at Universal: &quot;Wings of the Hawk&quot; (1953), and &quot;Tanganyika&quot; (1954). He starred in an independent Western, &quot;The Raid&quot; (1954) and was one of many stars in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; (1954).

Heflin stayed at Fox to star in &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1954) and he was top billed in Warners&#x27; &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (1955) based on Leon Uris&#x27;s best seller which was a major hit at the box office.

After a Western, &quot;Count Three and Pray&quot; (1955), Heflin starred in &quot;Patterns&quot; (1956) based on a TV play by Rod Serling. He also did a &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; written by Serling, &quot;The Dark Side of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Rank and File&quot;; he also did &quot;The Cruel Day&quot; by Reginald Rose.

Heflin returned to Broadway to appear in a double bill of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View From the Bridge&quot; and &quot;A Memory of Two Mondays&quot; which ran for 149 performances under the direction of Martin Ritt.

Heflin had an excellent part in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957) with Glenn Ford. He made a Western with Tab Hunter, his old &quot;Battle Cry&quot; co star, &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1958). That was made for Columbia, with whom Heflin signed a contract to make one film a year for five years.

===Europe===
Heflin then went to Italy to star in &quot;Tempest&quot; (1959). He was billed after Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth in &quot;They Came to Cordura&quot; (1959).

Heflin went back to Europe for &quot;5 Branded Women&quot; (1960), which he starred in for Martin Ritt, &quot;Under Ten Flags&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Wastrel&quot; (1961). In Hollywood he appeared on &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;.

Heflin went to the Philippines to star in a war film &quot;Cry of Battle&quot; (1963). This was playing at the Texas Theatre in Dallas on November 22, 1963. His name and the film title appear on the marquee. It was that theatre where Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended in the aftermath of President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

Heflin had another Broadway hit in the title role of &quot;A Case of Libel&quot; (1963–64) which ran for 242 performances.

===Later career===
Heflin appeared in a short but dramatic role as an eyewitness of Jesus&#x27; raising of Lazarus from death in the 1965 Bible film, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. After seeing the miracle he ran from Bethany to the walls of Jerusalem and proclaimed to the guards at the top of the wall that Jesus was the Messiah.

Heflin returned to MGM for a support part in &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1965). He was in the remake of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1966) and went to Europe to star in &quot;The Man Outside&quot; (1967) and &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; (1968).

In the US he was in the TV movies &quot;A Case of Libel&quot; (1968), and &quot;Certain Honorable Men&quot; (1968) and he had a support part in &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; (1969).

Heflin&#x27;s last feature film was &quot;Airport&quot; (1970). He played &quot;D. O. Guerrero&quot;, a failure who schemes to blow himself up on an airliner so that his wife (played by Maureen Stapleton) can collect on a life insurance policy. It was an enormous success.

His last TV movies were &quot;Neither Are We Enemies&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Last Child&quot; (1971).

==Personal life==
Heflin had a six-month marriage to actress Eleanor Shaw (née Eleanor Scherr) in the mid-thirties. In 1942, Heflin married RKO contract player Frances Neal. They had two daughters, actresses Vana O&#x27;Brien and Cathleen (Kate) Heflin, and a son, Tracy. The couple divorced in 1967.

Heflin was the grandfather of actor Ben O&#x27;Brien and actress Eleanor O&#x27;Brien. Van Heflin&#x27;s sister Frances Heflin, nickname &quot;Fra&quot;, regularly appeared as Mona Kane, mother of Erica, in the daytime television drama series &quot;All My Children&quot;. She played the role from January 5, 1970, until her death in June 1994. He was also the uncle of Marta Heflin and Mady Kaplan, both actresses, and director Jonathan Kaplan. Heflin&#x27;s brother, Martin, a public relations executive, was married to American theatre producer Julia Heflin.

==Death==
On June 6, 1971, Heflin suffered a heart attack in his swimming pool. He was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for nearly seven weeks and apparently never regained consciousness. Heflin died on July 23, 1971, at the age of 62. He had left instructions requesting a private funeral. His cremated remains were scattered in the ocean.

==Recognition==
In 1960, Heflin was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for his contributions to motion pictures at 6311 Hollywood Boulevard, and for television at 6125 Hollywood Boulevard. He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1964.

In February 2016, a biography, &quot;Van Heflin: A Life in Film&quot;, by Derek Sculthorpe, was published by McFarland &amp; Company of Jefferson, North Carolina.
