<text>Clarence Jordan (July 29, 1912 – October 29, 1969) was an American farmer and Baptist theologian, founder of Koinonia Farm, a small but influential religious community in southwest Georgia and the author of the Cotton Patch paraphrase of the New Testament. He was also instrumental in the founding of Habitat for Humanity. His second cousin, Hamilton Jordan, served as White House Chief of Staff during the Jimmy Carter administration.

==Life==

===Early years===
Clarence Jordan was born in Talbotton, Georgia, as the seventh of ten children to James Weaver and Maude Josey Jordan, prominent citizens of Talbotton. From an early age, Jordan was troubled by the racial and economic injustice that he perceived in his community. Hoping to improve the lot of sharecroppers through scientific farming techniques, he enrolled in the University of Georgia, earning a degree in agriculture in 1933. During his college years, however, he became convinced that the roots of poverty were spiritual as well as economic. This conviction led Jordan to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, from which he earned a Th.M. and a Ph.D. in the Greek New Testament in 1938. He was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister. While at seminary, Jordan met Florence Kroeger, whom he married.

===Koinonia Farm===
In 1942, the Jordans, another couple – Martin and Mabel England, who had previously served as American Baptist missionaries – and their families moved to a tract of land near Americus, Georgia, to create an interracial, Christian farming community. They called it (), a word meaning &#x27;communion&#x27; or &#x27;fellowship&#x27; that in Acts 2:42 is applied to the earliest Christian community.

The Koinonia partners bound themselves to the equality of all persons, rejection of violence, ecological stewardship, and common ownership of possessions. For several years the residents of Koinonia lived in relative peace alongside their Sumter County. However, as the Civil Rights Movement progressed, white citizens of the area increasingly perceived Koinonia as a threat. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Koinonia became the target of a stifling economic boycott and repeated violence, including several bombings. When Jordan sought help from President Eisenhower, the federal government refused to intervene, instead referring the matter to the governor of Georgia. The governor, Marvin Griffin, a staunch supporter of racial segregation, responded by ordering the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to investigate Koinonia&#x27;s partners and supporters for purported Communist ties.

Jordan chose not to participate in the marches and demonstrations of the era, instead believing that the best way to effect change in society was by living, in community, a radically different life.

Koinonia Farm continues to operate as a working farm and intentional Christian community welcoming visitors and interns and operating various ministries as an alternative to materialism, militarism and racism.

===Cotton Patch series===
In the late 1960s, the hostilities gradually subsided, and Jordan increasingly turned his energies to speaking and writing. Among the latter are his well-known &quot;Cotton Patch&quot; series, homey translations of New Testament writings. Jordan believed it was necessary not only to translate individual words and phrases, but also the context of Scripture. Thus, Jordan retitled the Apostle Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Ephesians &quot;The Letter to the Christians in Birmingham.&quot; His translation of Ephesians 2:11–13 is typical:

Along with his rendering of &quot;Jew and Gentile&quot; as &quot;white man and Negro,&quot; Jordan converted all references to &quot;crucifixion&quot; into references to &quot;lynching,&quot; believing that no other term was adequate for conveying the sense of the event into a modern American idiom:

The Cotton Patch series used American analogies for places in the New Testament; Rome became Washington, D.C., Judaea became Georgia (the Governor of Judaea became the Governor of Georgia), Jerusalem became Atlanta, and Bethlehem became Gainesville, Georgia.

Jordan&#x27;s translations of scripture portions led to the creation of a musical, Cotton Patch Gospel, telling the life of Jesus Christ using his style and set in Georgia, and incorporating some passages from his translations.

===Habitat for Humanity===

In 1965, Millard and Linda Fuller visited Koinonia, planning only to stay for a couple of hours. Inspired by Jordan, however, the Fullers chose to make Koinonia their permanent home in mid-1968. A marital crisis and dissatisfaction with their millionaire lifestyle had earlier persuaded the couple to sell their possessions and seek a life together in Christian service. The Fuller family brought renewed energy to Koinonia. The organization changed its name to Koinonia Partners and started a number of partnership type ventures such as &quot;Partnership Housing,&quot; a project to build and sell quality, affordable homes at cost with a no interest mortgage for low-income area families. The Fullers&#x27; five years at Koinonia followed by three years of building &quot;partnership housing&quot; in the Democratic Republic of Congo (then known as Zaire or Belgian Congo) would eventually lead, in 1976, to the creation of Habitat for Humanity.

On October 29, 1969, Jordan died suddenly of a heart attack, before the first house had been completed. As he had requested, Jordan had a simple burial; his body was placed in a shipping crate from a local casket manufacturer and was buried in an unmarked grave on Koinonia property. Jordan&#x27;s funeral was attended by his family, the Koinonia partners, and the poor of the community. Florence Jordan died at Koinonia in 1987 and was buried there. Jordan&#x27;s papers are housed at the University of Georgia.

<text>S.W.A.T. is a 2003 American action crime thriller film based on the 1975 television series of the same name. Written by David Ayer and David McKenna, with the story credited to Ron Mita and Jim McClain, directed by Clark Johnson and produced by Neal H. Moritz, the film stars Samuel L. Jackson, Colin Farrell, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Josh Charles, Jeremy Renner, Brian Van Holt and Olivier Martinez with Reg E. Cathey and Larry Poindexter in supporting roles.

Like the TV series, the film revolves around a police Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team operating in Los Angeles California. The plot follows Hondo (Jackson) and his SWAT team as they are tasked to escort an imprisoned drug kingpin/international fugitive to prison after he offers a $100 million reward to anyone who can break him out of police custody.

Plans for a film adaptation of the 1975 TV series began in the 1990s, but never materialized until the early 2000s. Johnson was hired as director and Jackson, Farrell and LL Cool J were cast in 2002.

&quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; was released in the United States on August 8, 2003 by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures banner. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $207 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
Los Angeles Police Department SWAT officer Jim Street, his partner Brian Gamble, and their team infiltrate a bank taken hostage by robbers (in a scene loosely based on the North Hollywood shootout), where Gamble disobeys orders and engages the robbers, causing a hostage to sustain injuries. He and Street manage to subdue the criminals but are taken off the SWAT team by Captain Fuller, the commanding officer of the LAPD Metropolitan Division. Fuller offers Street a chance to rejoin the team by implicating Gamble, but he refuses and is therefore demoted to working at the police inventory. Gamble, under the assumption that Street ratted on him to stay on SWAT, quits the force and ends their friendship.

Six months later, the chief of police calls on LAPD veteran, Sergeant Daniel &quot;Hondo&quot; Harrelson, to reorganize the SWAT team. Hondo takes an interest in Street, and recruits him along with fellow officers TJ McCabe, Michael Boxer, Deacon Kaye, and Chris Sanchez, despite Fuller&#x27;s protests. They bond as they train together and manage to pass their numerous tests; as they celebrate afterward, Street has a hostile run-in with Gamble. The team then succeeds in their first real mission: subduing an unstable gunman by using a wall-breaching battering ram designed by Street.

Meanwhile, French drug lord Alexander Montel arrives in Los Angeles and kills his uncle for embezzlement, after assuming control of his family&#x27;s criminal empire by killing his father. As he drives to the airport in his uncle&#x27;s car, he is pulled over by police for a broken tail light, and detained due to discrepancies with his false I.D.; authorities determine that he is an international fugitive and is wanted by Interpol. Montel&#x27;s associates, disguised as LAPD officers, attempt to break him out as he is being transferred to jail, killing two Sheriff&#x27;s deputies. Hondo&#x27;s team manages to arrive in time to kill the gunmen and recapture Montel. As reporters swarm the team, Montel announces to the cameras that he is willing to offer $100 million to whoever is able to break him out, which draws the attention of criminals across the city.

The LAPD prepare to transfer Montel into federal custody by air, but are unable to escape before Gamble shoots down the helicopter. The police send out a large convoy, which is ambushed by gang members but discovered to be a decoy for Hondo&#x27;s team, who transport Montel in two SUVs. McCabe reveals himself to be in league with Gamble, who critically wounds Boxer and escapes with Montel and McCabe to the subway, where they hijack a subway car and flee through the sewers as the SWAT team gives chase. Fuller then sends all available units to Hawthorne Airport to prevent Montel from escaping by plane.

Hondo&#x27;s team commandeers a limousine to reach the airport but realizes that Gamble has a private plane that will land on the Sixth Street Bridge to fly the criminals out of the country. Preparing to take off, the plane is intercepted by the SWAT team; Gamble&#x27;s men are killed, Sanchez is wounded while Kaye arrests Montel, and Hondo confronts McCabe, who commits suicide. Street pursues Gamble to the railyard under the bridge, where they fight hand-to-hand until Gamble is knocked under a passing train and killed. Fuller and the rest of the LAPD arrive, and Hondo&#x27;s team delivers Montel to federal prison. As the team drives back to Los Angeles, they receive a report of an armed robbery in progress to which Hondo readies his team with prompting from Street.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
A film adaptation of the 1975 &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; TV series was conceived in the 1990s; Sony was planning to produce and release the film under its TriStar Pictures banner with Marcus Nispel attached to direct. However, the project never panned out. Michael Bay, Rob Cohen, Antoine Fuqua, Michael Mann, Joel Schumacher, Tony Scott, Zack Snyder, Roger Spottiswoode, and John Woo were all approached to direct the film before Clark Johnson signed on. They passed because they were all busy with other projects. Oliver Stone was also involved as a producer at one point.

Following the box office success of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001), Neal H. Moritz was hired to produce the project.

=== Casting ===
Mark Wahlberg was the first choice for the role of Jim Street, but turned it down in favor of portraying the lead role in &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. Paul Walker was originally cast and had even started training for the part, but had to drop out due to filming on &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;. Colin Farrell eventually replaced him in July 2002. Vin Diesel was offered to portray Deacon &quot;Deke&quot; Kaye, but passed because he was in production with &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; and LL Cool J was then cast in September 2002. At one point during the early stages of development, Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for the role of Dan &quot;Hondo&quot; Harrelson, but he declined and Samuel L. Jackson took the part.

Jeremy Renner was cast as Brian Gamble following his performance in &quot;Dahmer&quot;. He was originally offered a role in &quot;The Big Bounce&quot;, but Renner turned it down.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place on location in Los Angeles. The bank robbery in the film&#x27;s opening was choreographed to closely resemble the North Hollywood shootout of 1997. It was filmed at an abandoned building at the corner Workman St and N Broadway in Lincoln Heights. The unit&#x27;s training scenes were filmed at the city&#x27;s historic Ambassador Hotel; the building was demolished in 2006. The film&#x27;s climax was shot on the former Sixth Street Viaduct, once one of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular bridges for location filming.

Elliot Goldenthal composed the soundtrack.

<text>Ketoconazole, sold under the brand name Nizoral, among others, is an antiandrogen, antifungal, and antiglucocorticoid medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. Applied to the skin it is used for fungal skin infections such as tinea, cutaneous candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis. Taken by mouth it is a less preferred option and recommended for only severe infections when other agents cannot be used. Other uses include treatment of excessive male-patterned hair growth in women and Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.
Common side effects when applied to the skin include redness. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, headache, and liver problems. Liver problems may result in death or the need for a liver transplantation. Other severe side effects when taken by mouth include QT prolongation, adrenocortical insufficiency, and anaphylaxis. It is an imidazole and works by hindering the production of ergosterol required for the fungal cell membrane, thereby slowing growth.
Ketoconazole was patented in 1977 by Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen, and came into medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication and formulations that are applied to the skin are over the counter in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions. The formulation that is taken by mouth was withdrawn in the European Union and in Australia in 2013, and in China in 2015. In addition, its use was restricted in the United States and Canada in 2013.
==Medical uses==

===Topical antifungal===
Topically administered ketoconazole is usually prescribed for fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes, such as athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used as a treatment for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus &quot;Malassezia furfur&quot; on the skin.

===Systemic antifungal===
Ketoconazole has activity against many kinds of fungi that may cause human disease, such as &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Histoplasma&quot;, &quot;Coccidioides&quot;, and &quot;Blastomyces&quot; (although it is not active against &quot;Aspergillus&quot;), chromomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. First made in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and/or itraconazole, because of ketoconazole&#x27;s greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity.

Ketoconazole is used orally in dosages of 200 to 400 mg per day in the treatment of superficial and deep fungal infections.

===Off-label uses===

====Hair loss====
Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride has been used off label to treat androgenic alopecia. It was speculated that antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia.

Limited clinical studies suggest ketoconazole shampoo used either alone or in combination with other treatments may be useful in reducing hair loss in some cases.

====Hormonal====
The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (&gt;800 mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.

Ketoconazole has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer.

==Contraindications==
Oral ketoconazole has various contraindications, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known drug interactions. Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, and known hypersensitivity to oral ketoconazole.

==Side effects==

===Gastrointestinal===
Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration may occur.

===Endocrine===
The drug may cause adrenal insufficiency so the level of the adrenocortical hormones should be monitored while taking it. Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000 mg/day has been found to result in a rate of gynecomastia of 21%.

===Liver===
In July 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: adrenal insufficiency and worsening of other related to the gland conditions. It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or not tolerated. As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease.

===Hypersensitivity===
Anaphylaxis after the first dose may occur. Other cases of hypersensitivity include urticaria.

===Topical formulations===
The topical formulations have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the ketoconazole tablets, which are taken by mouth.

===Pregnancy===
Ketoconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C in the US. Research in animals has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving ketoconazole.

==Overdose==
In the event of an overdose of oral ketoconazole, treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms. Activated charcoal may be administered within the first hour following overdose of oral ketoconazole.

== Interactions ==

The concomitant use of the following medications is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets:
* methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone
* irinotecan, lurasidone, colchicine
* alprazolam, oral midazolam, oral triazolam
* felodipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone
* HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin
* ergot alkaloids: ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, methylergometrine
* Others: cisapride, nisoldipine, dofetilide, pimozide

And is not recommended:
* carbamazepine, phenytoin
* gastric acid suppressants: antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors
* sucralfate
* rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid
* efavirenz, nevirapine

Ritonavir is known for increasing activity of the ketoconazole so it is recommended to reduce dosage.

There is also a list of drugs which significantly decrease systemic exposure to the ketoconazole and drugs whose systemic exposure is increased by the ketoconazole.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Antifungal activity====
As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to imidazole, and interferes with the fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.

Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including &quot;Candida albicans&quot;. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.

====Antihormonal activity====
As an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole.

Ketoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor.

Ketoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of &quot;cis&quot;-(2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-(−) and &quot;cis&quot;-(2&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;)-(+) enantiomers. The &quot;cis&quot;-(2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 &quot;μ&quot;M, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 &quot;μ&quot;M, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase.

Oral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole &quot;in vivo&quot; in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D.

Ketoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin &quot;in vitro&quot;, but this was not found to be relevant &quot;in vivo&quot;.

====Other activities====
Ketoconazole has been found to inhibit the activity of the cation channel TRPM5.

===Pharmacokinetics===
When administered orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug&#x27;s absorption. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues.

==Chemistry==
Ketoconazole is a synthetic imidazole. It is a nonsteroidal compound. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, levoketoconazole ((2&quot;S&quot;,4&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-ketoconazole) and dextroketoconazole ((2&quot;R&quot;,4&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-ketoconazole). Levoketoconazole is under development for potential clinical use as a steroidogenesis inhibitor with better tolerability and less toxicity than ketoconazole. Other steroidogenesis inhibitors besides ketoconazole and levoketoconazole include the nonsteroidal compound aminoglutethimide and the steroidal compound abiraterone acetate.

==History==
Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It was patented in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in July 1981. Following its introduction, ketoconazole was the only systemic antifungal available for almost a decade. Ketoconazole was introduced as the prototypical medication of the imidazole group of antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral fluconazole or itraconazole for many mycoses.

Due to incidence of serious liver toxicity, the use of oral ketoconazole was suspended in France in July 2011, following review. This event triggered an evaluation of oral ketoconazole throughout the rest of the European Union. In 2013, oral ketoconazole was withdrawn in the European Union and Australia, and strict restrictions were placed on the use of oral ketoconazole in the United States and Canada. Oral ketoconazole is indicated for use in these countries when the indication is a severe or life-threatening systemic infection and alternatives are unavailable. However, topical ketoconazole, which does not distribute systemically, is safe and widely used still.

Ketoconazole HRA was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome in November 2013.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
Ketoconazole is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and .

===Brand names===
Ketoconazole has been marketed under a large number of brand names.

===Availability===
Ketoconazole is available widely throughout the world.

In 2013, the European Medicines Agency&#x27;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits.

== Research ==
As of March 2019, oral levoketoconazole (developmental code name COR-003, tentative brand name Recorlev) is phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Oral levoketoconazole may have a lower risk of liver toxicity than oral ketoconazole.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Miranda Richardson) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Rosemary Harris). The National Board of Review also gave awards to Richardson as Best Actress and Harris as Best Supporting Actress for their performances in the film.

<doc id="781729" wikidata="Q86591" url="?curid=781729" title="Independence Day (United States)">
<text>Independence Day, known colloquially as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday in the United States which commemorates the ratification of the Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, establishing the United States of America.

The Founding Father delegates of the Second Continental Congress declared that the Thirteen Colonies were no longer subject (and subordinate) to the monarch of Britain, King George III, and were now united, free, and independent states. The Congress voted to approve independence by passing the Lee Resolution on July 2 and adopted the Declaration of Independence two days later, on July 4.

Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, political speeches, and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the national day of the United States.

==Background==
During the American Revolution, the legal separation of the thirteen colonies from Great Britain in 1776 actually occurred on July 2, when the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence that had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia declaring the United States independent from Great Britain&#x27;s rule. After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by the Committee of Five, which asked Thomas Jefferson to author its first draft.

While Jefferson consulted extensively with the other four members of the Committee of Five, he largely wrote the Declaration of Independence in isolation over 17 days between June 11, 1776, and June 28, 1776, from the second floor he was renting in a three-story private home at 700 Market Street in Philadelphia, now known as the Declaration House, and within walking distance of Independence Hall.

Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, removing Jefferson&#x27;s vigorous denunciation of King George III for importing the slave trade, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail:

Adams&#x27;s prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress.

Historians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have concluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.

By remarkable coincidence, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, the only two signatories of the Declaration of Independence later to serve as presidents of the United States, both died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Although not a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, James Monroe, another Founding Father who was elected president, also died on July 4, 1831, making him the third President who died on the anniversary of independence. The only U.S. president to have been born on Independence Day was Calvin Coolidge, who was born on July 4, 1872.

==Observance==
* In 1777, thirteen gunshots were fired in salute, once at morning and once again as evening fell, on July 4 in Bristol, Rhode Island. An article in the July 18, 1777, issue of &quot;The Virginia Gazette&quot; noted a celebration in Philadelphia in a manner a modern American would find familiar: an official dinner for the Continental Congress, toasts, 13-gun salutes, speeches, prayers, music, parades, troop reviews, and fireworks. Ships in port were decked with red, white, and blue bunting.
* In 1778, from his headquarters at Ross Hall, near New Brunswick, New Jersey, General George Washington marked July 4 with a double ration of rum for his soldiers and an artillery salute (&quot;feu de joie&quot;). Across the Atlantic Ocean, ambassadors John Adams and Benjamin Franklin held a dinner for their fellow Americans in Paris, France.
* In 1779, July 4 fell on a Sunday. The holiday was celebrated on Monday, July 5.
* In 1781, the Massachusetts General Court became the first state legislature to recognize July 4 as a state celebration.
* In 1783, Salem, North Carolina, held a celebration with a challenging music program assembled by Johann Friedrich Peter entitled &quot;The Psalm of Joy&quot;. The town claims it to be the first public July 4 event, as it was carefully documented by the Moravian Church, and there are no government records of any earlier celebrations.
* In 1870, the U.S. Congress made Independence Day an unpaid holiday for federal employees.
* In 1938, Congress changed Independence Day to a paid federal holiday.

==Customs==
Independence Day is a national holiday marked by patriotic displays. Per , Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as the postal service and federal courts) are closed on that day. While the legal holiday remains on July 4, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then federal government employees will instead take the day off on the adjacent Friday or Monday, respectively. Other non-essential that are non-government related may also be closed that day.

Families often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or barbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long weekend to gather with family members or friends. Parades are often attended in many towns and cities, some being hours-long, with many floats and participants. Parades are often held in the mid-late morning (before get-togethers), with longer spectacles sometimes extending into the early afternoon. Fireworks displays typically occur in the evening, at such places as parks, harbors, off of boats, sporting venues, fairgrounds, public shorelines, or town squares. Decorations (e.g., streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors of the American flag, and many homes and businesses will decorate their properties with miniature American flags.

The night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings, often incorporating bonfires as their highlight. In New England, towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels and casks. They were lit at nightfall to usher in the celebration. The highest ever were in Salem, Massachusetts, with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels. These made some of the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries and is still practiced in some New England and northeastern towns.

Independence Day fireworks are often accompanied by patriotic songs, such as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; (the American national anthem); &quot;Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean&quot;; &quot;God Bless America&quot;; &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;; &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;; &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;; &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;; &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;; &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot; (in southern states); &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;; and occasionally (but has nominally fallen out of favor), &quot;Hail Columbia&quot;. Some of the lyrics recall images of the Revolutionary War or the War of 1812.

Firework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have led some states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In addition, local and regional conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed; for example, the global supply chain crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic forced cancellations of shows. Some local or regional firework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other specific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as those at sports events) may still take place.

A salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a &quot;salute to the union&quot;, is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.

New York City has the largest fireworks display in the country sponsored by Macy&#x27;s, with more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded in 2009. It generally holds displays in the East River. Other major displays are in Seattle on Lake Union; in San Diego over Mission Bay; in Boston on the Charles River; in Philadelphia over the Philadelphia Museum of Art; in San Francisco over the San Francisco Bay; and on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

During the annual Windsor–Detroit International Freedom Festival, Detroit, Michigan, hosts one of the largest fireworks displays in North America, over the Detroit River, to celebrate Independence Day in conjunction with Windsor, Ontario&#x27;s celebration of Canada Day.

The first week of July is typically one of the busiest United States travel periods of the year, as many people use what is often a three-day holiday weekend for extended vacation trips.

==Notable celebrations==
* Held since 1785, the Bristol Fourth of July Parade in Bristol, Rhode Island, is the oldest continuous Independence Day celebration in the United States.
* Since 1868, Seward, Nebraska, has held a celebration on the same town square. In 1979 Seward was designated &quot;America&#x27;s Official Fourth of July City-Small Town USA&quot; by resolution of Congress. Seward has also been proclaimed &quot;Nebraska&#x27;s Official Fourth of July City&quot; by Governor J. James Exon in proclamation. Seward is a town of 6,000 but swells to 40,000+ during the July 4 celebrations.
* Since 1912, the Rebild Society, a Danish-American friendship organization, has held a July 4 weekend festival that serves as a homecoming for Danish-Americans in the Rebild Hills of Denmark.
* Since 1959, the International Freedom Festival is jointly held in Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, during the last week of June each year as a mutual celebration of Independence Day and Canada Day (July 1). It culminates in a large fireworks display over the Detroit River.
* The famous Macy&#x27;s 4th of July Fireworks display usually held over the East River in New York City has been televised nationwide on NBC, and locally on WNBC-TV since 1976. In 2009, the fireworks display was returned to the Hudson River for the first time since 2000 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s exploration of that river.
* The Boston Pops Orchestra has hosted a music and fireworks show over the Charles River Esplanade called the &quot;Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular&quot; annually since 1974. Cannons are traditionally fired during the 1812 Overture. The event was broadcast nationally from 1991 until 2002 on A&amp;E, and since 2002 by CBS and its Boston station WBZ-TV. WBZ/1030 and WBZ-TV broadcast the entire event locally, and from 2002 through 2012, CBS broadcast the final hour of the concert nationally in primetime. The national broadcast was put on hiatus beginning in 2013, which Pops executive producer David G. Mugar believed was the result of decreasing viewership caused by NBC&#x27;s encore presentation of the Macy&#x27;s fireworks. The national broadcast was revived for 2016, and expanded to two hours. In 2017, Bloomberg Television took over coverage duty, with WHDH carrying local coverage beginning in 2018.
* On the Capitol lawn in Washington, D.C., &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot;, a free concert broadcast live by PBS, NPR and the American Forces Network, precedes the fireworks and attracts over half a million people annually.

==Other countries==

The Philippines celebrates July 4 as its Republic Day to commemorate the day in 1946 when it ceased to be a U.S. territory and the United States officially recognized Philippine Independence.
July 4 was intentionally chosen by the United States because it corresponds to its Independence Day, and this day was observed in the Philippines as Independence Day until 1962. In 1964, the name of the July 4 holiday was changed to Republic Day.

Rebild National Park in Denmark is said to hold the largest July 4 celebrations outside of the United States.

While not an Independence Day celebration by any means, the city of Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada celebrates its founding every July 4, having been founded on July 4, 1634. Trois-Rivières was also the site of the final battle of the American Revolutionary War that was fought on Quebec soil in June 1776, the Battle of Trois-Rivières, which was also a part of the Continental Army&#x27;s failed American Invasion of Quebec. Following a defeat at the hands of the British, the Continental Army retreated to Fort Saint-Jean in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, and then to Fort Ticonderoga in Ticonderoga, New York, before permanently ceasing their invasion of Quebec in July 1776.

In the English city of Gloucester, its cathedral rang bells in 2019 and 2020 for the anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; every July 4 for its links to the anthem, commemorating its status as the birthplace of John Stafford Smith, who composed the tune on which the anthem is based.

<text>Little Women is a 1994 American coming-of-age historical drama film directed by Gillian Armstrong. The screenplay by Robin Swicord is based on Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s 1868–69 two-volume novel of the same title, the fifth feature film adaptation of the classic story. After a limited release on December 25, 1994, it was released nationwide four days later by Columbia Pictures.

It received critical acclaim and grossed $95 million worldwide. It received three Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Ryder), Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score. It was followed by a loose sequel, &quot;Little Men&quot;.

==Plot==
The March sisters—responsible Meg, tempestuous Jo, tender Beth, and romantic Amy—are growing up in Concord, Massachusetts during and after the American Civil War. Their father is away fighting in the war and, with their strong-willed mother, Marmee, they struggle with major and minor problems in 19th-century New England. The girls revel in performing Jo&#x27;s romantic plays in their attic theater.

Next-door neighbor, wealthy Mr. Laurence&#x27;s grandson, Theodore (&quot;Laurie&quot;), moves in, becoming a close friend of the Marches, particularly Jo. Mr. Laurence mentors Beth, whose exquisite piano-playing reminds him of his deceased daughter, and Meg falls in love with Laurie&#x27;s tutor, John Brooke.

When Mr. March is wounded, Jo sells her hair so Marmee can go by train to nurse him back to health. While she is away, Beth continues visiting a struggling immigrant family, providing food and firewood. She contracts scarlet fever from the youngest child. Awaiting Marmee&#x27;s return, Meg and Jo, who both previously survived scarlet fever, decide to send Amy away to live safely with their Aunt March. Amy laments to Laurie that she may die without ever being kissed. He promises to kiss her before she dies if she becomes ill.

Prior to Beth&#x27;s illness, Jo had been Aunt March&#x27;s companion for several years, and although she didn&#x27;t enjoy it, she hoped she would take her to Europe. Beth gets worse, so Marmee returns home, nursing her to recovery in time for Christmas, but the illness severely weakens her. Mr. Laurence gives his daughter&#x27;s piano to Beth, Meg accepts John Brooke&#x27;s proposal and Mr. March surprises them, returning home from the war.

Four years pass; a now twenty years old Meg and John marry, and eighteen-year-old Beth&#x27;s health is worsening. Graduating from college, Laurie proposes to nineteen year old Jo and asks her to go to London with him but, seeing him more as a brother than a lover, she refuses. Jo is disappointed when Aunt March decides to take seventeen-year-old Amy with her to Europe instead of her. She has been Aunt March&#x27;s companion and wishes to further her artistic training in Europe. Crushed, Jo departs for New York City to pursue writing and experience life. There she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor who challenges and stimulates her intellectually, introducing her to opera and philosophy, and encouraging her to write better stories than the lurid Victorian melodramas she has penned so far.

In Europe, Amy is reunited with Laurie. Disappointed to find he has become dissolute and irresponsible; she scolds him for pursuing her merely to become part of the March family. In return, he bitterly rebukes her for courting one of his wealthy college friends to marry into money. He asks Amy to wait for him in a letter while he works in London for his grandfather and makes himself worthy.

Jo is called home for Beth, who finally dies of the after-effects of scarlet fever. A saddened Jo retreats to the comfort of the attic, writing her life story. Upon its completion, she sends it to Professor Bhaer. Meanwhile, Meg has twins Demi and Daisy.

A letter from Amy tells them Aunt March is too ill to travel, so Amy must remain in Europe with her. In London, Laurie receives a letter from Jo about Beth&#x27;s death, saying Amy is in Vevey, Switzerland, unable to come home. He immediately goes to be at Amy&#x27;s side. They finally return to the March home as spouses, to Jo&#x27;s surprise and eventual delight.

Aunt March dies, leaving Jo her house. She turns it into a school. Professor Bhaer arrives with the printed galley proofs of her manuscript but, believing Jo is married, he departs to catch a train to the West, to accept a professorship. Jo runs after him, explaining the misunderstanding. She begs him not to go. He then proposes to her, and she happily accepts.

* Donal Logue as Jacob Mayer

==Production==
It took &quot;Little Women&quot; 12 years to find a studio. According to writer Robin Swicord and producer Denise Di Novi, &quot;people just weren&#x27;t interested in a movie with a lot of women&quot;. One executive suggested a modern adaptation, with &quot;the Marches...in the 90s and not happy about not having a car for Christmas&quot;. Di Novi said that films like &quot;Little Women&quot; were dismissively referred to in the film industry as &quot;needle in the eye&quot; pictures, &quot;where a guy would say to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a needle in the eye than go to that movie&#x27;&quot;. These films were assumed to have no appeal for male audiences and thus deemed not worth the risk of production. Eventually, Columbia agreed to consider the project under the condition that Winona Ryder was to play Jo.

Originally, Gillian Armstrong wasn&#x27;t on board with directing &quot;Little Women&quot;. She rejected the offer several times due to the similarities between &quot;Little Women&quot; and her previous film, &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;. However, with persuasion from Di Novi and Amy Pascal, Armstrong came to realize that the two films were different after all. With the help of screenwriter Robin Swicord, they aimed to portray more mature themes than those of the previous adaptations, including family, growing up, and progressive feminism. During pre-production, Armstrong decided not to look to the previous films for inspiration, choosing instead to stay true to the novel.

===Casting===
Along with Winona Ryder, already signed on to play Jo, offers for the roles of Marmee and Laurie were sent out to Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale. Sarandon almost turned down the role because &quot;... it was towards the end of the school year, and I had a pretty strict policy about not leaving my young kids&quot;.

The part of Amy was the most difficult casting decision to be made. This adaptation was the first and only to have two different actresses play Amy over the course of the film. According to producer Di Novi, there was something &quot;weird&quot; about having one actress playing first a child and then an adult: &quot;It just didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

Among those to read for the role of Amy were the then-unknown Natalie Portman, and Thora Birch, who had already filmed &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; and &quot;Patriot Games&quot;. In the end, Kirsten Dunst was chosen. Armstrong mentioned in a 2019 interview that &quot;Kirsten Dunst really blew [other young Amy candidates] out of the water&quot;. The role of the older Amy was a close decision between Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis. Armstrong&#x27;s first pick, if the production had decided on casting only one actress to play Amy, was Witherspoon. However, casting director Carrie Frazier settled on Mathis for the part.

The initial candidate to play Bhaer, for Di Novi, was Hugh Grant, commenting &quot;we all had a huge crush on [him]&quot;. However, Frazier was not on board with the idea, claiming that the option was a bit &quot;off the rails&quot;. Grant was ultimately deemed too young and confident to play the Bhaer of the book that Frazier, Di Novi, and Armstrong wanted. John Turturro also lobbied persistently for the role, but Frazier wanted a deeper and more poetic Bhaer, and decided on Gabriel Byrne.

=== Filming ===
The 1994 adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot; was filmed primarily in parts of Canada, such as Vancouver Island and Vancouver, both in the province of British Columbia. However, certain scenes were shot in the United States, specifically Massachusetts. Gillian Armstrong was adamant about creating a look that remained faithful to &quot;Little Women&#x27;s&quot; time period. The overall aesthetic for the film was heavily influenced by photographs, paintings, and drawings from the Civil War era, the period when the novel &quot;Little Women&quot; was written. Armstrong, cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson, art director Jan Roelfs, and costume designer Colleen Atwood sought inspiration from artworks of the era for the sets, costumes, color coordination, and even camera lighting.

The film is dedicated to murder victim Polly Klaas and literary agent Judy Scott-Fox.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Little Women&quot; was well-received by film critics upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 100 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Thanks to a powerhouse lineup of talented actresses, Gillian Armstrong&#x27;s take on Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; proves that a timeless story can succeed no matter how many times it&#x27;s told.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Ratings were positive across all ages and groups, with the lowest being an A-minus grade from men.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3 stars, calling it &quot;a surprisingly sharp and intelligent telling of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s famous story, and not the soft-edged children&#x27;s movie it might appear.&quot; He added, &quot;[It] grew on me. At first, I was grumpy, thinking it was going to be too sweet and devout. Gradually, I saw that Gillian Armstrong [...] was taking it seriously. And then I began to appreciate the ensemble acting, with the five actresses creating the warmth and familiarity of a real family.&quot;

Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film &quot;meticulously crafted and warmly acted&quot; and observed it &quot;is one of the rare Hollywood studio films that invites your attention, slowly and elegantly, rather than propelling your interest with effects and easy manipulation.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened on 1,503 screens in the US and Canada on December 21, 1994. It grossed $5.3 million and ranked number 6 at the box office on its opening weekend and eventually grossed $50.1 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally, it grossed $45 million for a worldwide total of $95 million, against a production budget of $15–18 million.

<doc id="781806" wikidata="Q6722305" url="?curid=781806" title="Mac Lane's planarity criterion">
<text>In graph theory, Mac Lane&#x27;s planarity criterion is a characterisation of planar graphs in terms of their cycle spaces, named after Saunders Mac Lane who published it in 1937. It states that a finite undirected graph is planar if and only if 
the cycle space of the graph (taken modulo 2) has a cycle basis in which each edge of the graph participates in at most two basis vectors.

==Statement==
For any cycle in a graph on edges, one can form an -dimensional 0-1 vector that has a 1 in the coordinate positions corresponding to edges in and a 0 in the remaining coordinate positions. The cycle space of the graph is the vector space formed by all possible linear combinations of vectors formed in this way. In Mac Lane&#x27;s characterization, is a vector space over the finite field with two elements; that is, in this vector space, vectors are added coordinatewise modulo two. A &quot;2-basis&quot; of is a basis of with the property that, for each edge in , at most two basis vectors have nonzero coordinates in the position corresponding to . Then, stated more formally, Mac Lane&#x27;s characterization is that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that have a 2-basis.

==Existence of a 2-basis for planar graphs==
One direction of the characterisation states that every planar graph has a 2-basis. Such a basis may be found as the collection of boundaries of the bounded faces of a planar embedding of the given graph .

If an edge is a bridge of , it appears twice on a single face boundary and therefore has a zero coordinate in the corresponding vector. Thus, the only edges that have nonzero coordinates are the ones that separate two different faces; these edges appear either once (if one of the faces is the unbounded one) or twice in the collection of boundaries of bounded faces. It remains to prove that these cycles form a basis. One way to prove this by induction. As a base case, is a tree, then it has no bounded faces and is zero-dimensional and has an empty basis. Otherwise, removing an edge from the unbounded face of reduces both the dimension of the cycle space and the number of bounded faces by one and the induction follows.

Alternatively, it is possible to use Euler&#x27;s formula to show that the number of cycles in this collection equals the circuit rank of , which is the dimension of the cycle space. Each nonempty subset of cycles has a vector sum that represents the boundary of the union of the bounded faces in the subset, which cannot be empty (the union includes at least one bounded face and excludes the unbounded face, so there must be some edges separating them). Therefore, there is no subset of cycles whose vectors sum to zero, which means that all the cycles are linearly independent. As a linearly independent set of the same size as the dimension of the space, this collection of cycles must form a basis.

==Necessity of planarity when a 2-basis exists==
 provided the following simple argument for the other direction of the characterization, based on Wagner&#x27;s theorem characterizing the planar graphs by forbidden minors. As O&#x27;Neill observes, the property of having a 2-basis is preserved under graph minors: if one contracts an edge, the same contraction may be performed in the basis vectors, if one removes an edge that has a nonzero coordinate in a single basis vector, then that vector may be removed from the basis, and if one removes an edge that has a nonzero coordinate in two basis vectors, then those two vectors may be replaced by their sum (modulo two). Additionally, if is a cycle basis for any graph, then it must cover some edges exactly once, for otherwise its sum would be zero (impossible for a basis), and so can be augmented by one more cycle consisting of these singly-covered edges while preserving the property that every edge is covered at most twice.
However, the complete graph has no 2-basis: is six-dimensional, each nontrivial vector in has nonzero coordinates for at least three edges, and so any augmented basis would have at least 21 nonzeros, exceeding the 20 nonzeros that would be allowed if each of the ten edges were nonzero in at most two basis vectors. By similar reasoning, the complete bipartite graph has no 2-basis: is four-dimensional, and each nontrivial vector in has nonzero coordinates for at least four edges, so any augmented basis would have at least 20 nonzeros, exceeding the 18 nonzeros that would be allowed if each of the nine edges were nonzero in at most two basis vectors. Since the property of having a 2-basis is minor-closed and is not true of the two minor-minimal nonplanar graphs and , it is also not true of any other nonplanar graph.

 provided another proof, based on algebraic topology. He uses a slightly different formulation of the planarity criterion, according to which a graph is planar if and only if it has a set of (not necessarily simple) cycles covering every edge exactly twice, such that the only nontrivial relation among these cycles in is that their sum be zero. If this is the case, then leaving any one of the cycles out produces a basis satisfying Mac Lane&#x27;s formulation of the criterion. If a planar graph is embedded on a sphere, its face cycles clearly satisfy Lefschetz&#x27;s property. Conversely, as Lefschetz shows, whenever a graph &quot;G&quot; has a set of cycles with this property, they necessarily form the face cycles of an embedding of the graph onto the sphere.

==Application==
 used Mac Lane&#x27;s planarity criterion as part of a parallel algorithm for testing graph planarity and finding planar embeddings. Their algorithm partitions the graph into triconnected components, after which there is a unique planar embedding (up to the choice of the outer face) and the cycles in a 2-basis can be assumed to be all the peripheral cycles of the graph. Ja&#x27;Ja&#x27; and Simon start with a fundamental cycle basis of the graph (a cycle basis generated from a spanning tree by forming a cycle for each possible combination of a path in the tree and an edge outside the tree) and transform it into a 2-basis of peripheral cycles. These cycles form the faces of a planar embedding of the given graph.

Mac Lane&#x27;s planarity criterion allows the number of bounded face cycles in a planar graph to be counted easily, as the circuit rank of the graph. This property is used in defining the meshedness coefficient of the graph, a normalized variant of the number of bounded face cycles that is computed by dividing the circuit rank by , the maximum possible number of bounded faces of a planar graph with the same vertex set .

<text>Jonathan Daniel Harris ( Charasuchin; November 6, 1914 – November 3, 2002) was an American character actor whose career included more than 500 television and film appearances, as well as voiceovers. Two of his best-known roles were as the prudent accountant Bradford Webster in the television version of &quot;The Third Man&quot; and the fussy villain Dr. Zachary Smith of the 1960s science-fiction series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Near the end of his career, he provided voices for the animated features &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.

==Biography==
The second of three children, Harris was born on November 6, 1914, in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian Jewish immigrants Jennie ( Buchowitsky) and Sam Charasuchin. His father worked in Manhattan&#x27;s Garment District. The family lived in a six-story tenement, and his mother often took in boarders to make ends meet, giving them Jonathan&#x27;s room and bed and relegating him to sleep on the dining room chairs. By age 12 he was working in a pharmacy as a stockboy. 

While there was little money for luxuries, Jonathan&#x27;s father made an effort to expand his son&#x27;s cultural horizons with occasional trips to see Yiddish theatre and by listening to opera on the dining room radio. Young Jonathan was enthralled. Although he could seldom afford tickets to them, Broadway plays were also an early interest. He detested his Bronx accent and by high school cultivated an English one in its place, watching British B-movies at the arts theater. He also developed interests in archaeology, Latin, romantic poetry and Shakespeare.

Jonathan legally changed his name from &quot;Charasuchin&quot; to &quot;Harris&quot; before entering college after a year-long standoff with his father, who disagreed with the change.

===Pharmacology career===
Harris earned a degree in pharmacology from Fordham University, from which he graduated in 1936. 

===Marriage===
Harris was married to his high school sweetheart, Gertrude Bregman, from 1938 until his death. They had one child, Richard, born 1942.

===Acting career===

====Stage====
Acting was Harris&#x27;s first love. In 1939, at age 24, he prepared a fake résumé and tried out for a repertory company at the Millpond Playhouse on Long Island. He was hired by the director, Richard Brooks, to appear in a series of 26 plays the company performed in the summer of 1940.

In 1942, Harris won the leading role of a Polish officer in the Broadway play &quot;The Heart of a City&quot;, adopting a Polish accent. In 1946, he starred in &quot;A Flag Is Born&quot;, opposite Quentin Reynolds and Marlon Brando.

====Early television career====
Harris was a popular character actor for 30 years on television, making his first guest appearance on the episode &quot;His Name Is Jason&quot; on &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot; in 1949. The role led to other roles in such series as: &quot;The Web&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, three episodes of &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Telephone Time&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Rogues&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, and &quot;Zorro&quot;, among many others.

Harris landed a co-starring role opposite Michael Rennie in &quot;The Third Man&quot;, from 1959 to 1965. He played Bradford Webster, an eccentric, cowardly assistant. Half of the episodes were shot in London, England; the rest were filmed in Hollywood.

Harris appeared in two 1961 episodes of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, including a heroic role in &quot;The Silence&quot;, in which he ended up defending a young man challenged to be silent for a whole year at a prestigious gentleman&#x27;s club. Harris also portrayed Charles Dickens in a 1963 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

From 1963 to 1965, Harris co-starred in the sitcom &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot;. He played Mr. Phillips, the pompous manager of a posh hotel who is constantly at odds with his bumbling Bolivian bellhop, the Bill Dana character José Jiménez. Don Adams rounded out the cast as an inept house detective, a character whose distinctive mannerisms and catchphrases would soon carry over into his Maxwell Smart role on &quot;Get Smart&quot;. In similar fashion, several of Harris&#x27;s catchphrases from the series, such as &quot;Oh, the pain!&quot;, along with the character&#x27;s mannerisms and delivery, became part of the Dr. Zachary Smith character on &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

Harris played a similarly pompous diplomat on &quot;Get Smart&quot; in 1970. His female assistant was named Zachary. Harris also guest-starred on &quot;The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir&quot;.

====Dr. Zachary Smith in &quot;Lost in Space&quot;====
Harris was cast over two other actors for the role of Dr. Zachary Smith, the evil and conniving enemy agent on &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. The character did not appear in the original 1965 pilot episode for CBS, nor did The Robot. The series was already in production when Harris joined the cast, and starring/co-starring billing had already been contractually assigned. Harris successfully negotiated to receive &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; billing on every episode.

Bill Mumy said of Harris&#x27; role in his first episode: 

The series was successful upon its debut and, midway through the first season, Harris began to rewrite his own dialogue to add more comedy because he felt that his strength was in portraying a comic villain. Due to Harris&#x27;s popularity on the show, Irwin Allen approved his changes and gave him as a writer. Harris subsequently stole the show, mainly via a seemingly never-ending series of alliterative insults directed toward The Robot, which soon worked their way into popular culture. Dr. Smith&#x27;s best-known tropes included spitefully calling The Robot epithets such as &quot;bubble-headed booby&quot; and &quot;clamoring clod&quot;.

According to Bill Mumy, Harris moved quickly to develop the character: 

When the series was renewed for its third and final season, it remained focused on Harris&#x27; character, Dr. Smith. While the series was still solidly placed in the middle of the ratings pack, the writers appeared to run out of fresh ideas, and the show was unexpectedly canceled in 1968 after 83 episodes, despite protests from its fans.

====Later career====
In the mid-1970s, Harris starred in live-action roles in two Saturday morning children&#x27;s series, &quot;Space Academy&quot; and &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;, and was a well-known TV spokesman for the International House of Pancakes. He made several cameo and guest appearances during this period, including episodes of &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.

In a 1971 episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, titled &quot;Since Aunt Ada Came to Stay&quot;, Harris played Professor Nicholas Porteus, an expert on witchcraft.

His last series guest-starring role was on an episode of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. He also starred as the character Fagan in the first episode of the science fiction series &quot;Ark II&quot;.

Harris taught drama, and was Chuck Norris&#x27;s vocal coach for many years. Norris credited Harris for teaching him &quot;how to speak&quot; by sticking his fingers in Norris&#x27;s mouth, adding that Harris was the only person in the world he would allow to do that.

====Typecasting as a villain====

Although he was considered something of a cult icon for the role of Dr. Smith, Harris became typecast as a and sometimes campy villain. For example, Irwin Allen cast Harris as a villainous &quot;Pied Piper&quot; in an episode of &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;. Approached by Allen a second time, to star in a children&#x27;s series, &quot;Jumbalina and the Teeners&quot;, Harris turned it down.

In 1970, Harris played the role of another not-so-likeable villain, the Bulmanian Ambassador in the &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode &quot;How Green Was My Valet&quot;. Harris was also a co-star, alongside Charles Nelson Reilly, in the series &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;, in which Harris and Reilly portrayed malcontents producing a children&#x27;s television show. Harris played the director and Reilly the titular host, Uncle Croc. In the cartoon &quot;&quot; (1987), he played lackey and sycophant Mortdred to the main villain Darkstorm.

Harris also provided the voice of the Cylon character Lucifer, an antagonist on the original ABC version of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978).

====Voice roles====
Harris spent much of his later career working as a voice actor, and during it he was heard on television commercials as well as on cartoons such as &quot;Channel Umptee-3&quot;, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot;, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. He also did voiceover work in an episode of the animated &quot;Superman&quot; series.

In multiple episodes of the 1995–1997 cartoon series &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, Harris reprised the cowardly Smith character and dialogue under the name &quot;Professor Jones,&quot; uttering Smith&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Oh, the pain!&quot; Emphasizing the target of the parody, numerous characters would ask him, &quot;Weren&#x27;t you on a TV show with a robot?&quot;

In 2001, a year prior to his death, he recorded voice work for the animated theatrical short &quot;The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas&quot;. The film, Harris&#x27;s last work, was released posthumously in 2009.

====&quot;Lost in Space&quot; reunion appearances====
In 1990, Harris reunited with the cast of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; in a filmed celebration of the 25th anniversary of the series&#x27; debut, at an event attended by more than 30,000 fans. Harris made a number of other convention appearances with other cast members of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, including a 1996 appearance at Disney World.

On June 14, 1995, Harris and other cast members appeared in &quot;The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen&quot;, a television tribute to Irwin Allen, the creator of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, who had died in 1991.

Harris refused to make a cameo appearance in the 1990s re-imagined film version of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (1998), unlike many of his co-stars in the original series. He announced: &quot;I&#x27;ve never played a bit part in my life and I&#x27;m not going to start now!&quot; However, he did make promotional appearances for the film:

* Harris reprised his role as Dr. Smith in the one-hour television special &quot;Lost in Space Forever&quot;, and Harris and the rest of the surviving television cast appeared on the inside cover of an issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;.
* In April 1998, Harris appeared as a guest on the talk show &quot;Biography&quot;, on which Harris fondly reminisced about his &quot;Lost in Space&quot; days, admitting he would stay up nights thinking of new alliterative insults for The Robot (&quot;bellicose bumpkin,&quot; &quot;bubble-headed booby&quot;) because he enjoyed the interaction so much.
* For an appearance by Harris, talk show host Conan O&#x27;Brien brought one of his characters, Pimp-Bot 5000 (a &quot;robot pimp&quot;; half 1950s’ robot, half 1970s’ street pimp), onto the set, and Harris went into character as Dr. Smith and proceeded to insult Pimp-Bot. Shying away from his usual dry, sarcastic, and often self-deprecating style, Conan confessed to Harris that he brought him on the show just to have him insult Pimp-Bot, and that the moment made his day.

In late 2002, Harris and the rest of the surviving cast of the television series were preparing to film an NBC two-hour film titled &quot;Lost in Space: The Journey Home&quot;; however, the project was unable to proceed after Harris&#x27; death.

===Death and posthumous tributes===
After he had been in a hospital for a back injury, Harris died of a blood clot on November 3, 2002, three days before his 88th birthday.

As a tribute to Harris, writer/director John Wardlaw wrote an additional scene for the film &quot;The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas&quot;, which included Harris&#x27;s final performance before his death. Wardlaw asked &quot;Lost in Space&quot; co-stars Bill Mumy, Angela Cartwright, and Marta Kristen to contribute their voices to the film. Wardlaw described how the three actors reunited in the recording studio on June 14, 2006: 

Nearly five years later, Harris&#x27; wife died of natural causes, at age 93, on August 28, 2007.

<text>The Chino Mine (&quot;Chino&quot; is Spanish for the &quot;Chinese&quot;), also known as the Santa Rita mine or Santa Rita del Cobre, is an American open-pit porphyry copper mine located in the town of Santa Rita, New Mexico east of Silver City. The mine was started as the Chino Copper Company in 1909 by mining engineer John M. Sully and Spencer Penrose, and is currently owned and operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. subsidiaries. The area where the mine is located is at an average elevation of .

Apaches, Spaniards, Mexicans, and Americans have all obtained native copper and copper ore from this site. The present-day open-pit mining operation was begun in 1910. It is the third oldest active open pit copper mine in the world after the Bingham Canyon Mine and Chuquicamata.

==History==
An Apache Indian showed Spanish officer Lt. Colonel Jose Manuel Carrasco the site of the Chino mine in 1800. Carrasco recognized the rich copper deposits and began mining, but lacked the expertise to exploit the copper. He sold the Santa Rita del Cobre mine, as he had named it, to Francisco Manuel de EIguea in 1804 who imported convict labor to work the mine and build a fort (presidio) to house the convicts and protect them from the Apache. The miners sent pack trains of mules loaded with copper to Chihuahua. Americans Sylvester Pattie, James Kirker, and Robert McKnight managed the mine in the 1820s and 1830s. Partners Robert McKnight and Stephen Courcier took possession of “El Cobre,” (Santa Rita del Cobre mine) in 1828 and worked the property until 1834. McKnight and Courcier profited greatly from the rich copper mining operation and amassed a large fortune from it.
Santa Rita was located in the heart of Apache country and was plagued by Apache raids. Historians often state that an infamous massacre of Apache by John Johnson in 1837 took place at Santa Rita, although it is more likely that the incident took place further south, near the Animas Mountains. (See Apache-Mexico Wars) Johnson&#x27;s attack incited rather than intimidated the Apache. Mangas Coloradas and his followers were especially menacing. Twenty-two fur trappers were killed nearby, and the mine was cut off from supplies. In 1838, the 300 to 400 inhabitants of Santa Rita fled south toward the presidio at Janos, Chihuahua, 150 miles away, but the Apache killed nearly all of them en route. After that, Santa Rita was only occasionally operational until 1873 when Apache chief Cochise signed a peace agreement with the US and the mine was reopened. Apache raids in the area continued until 1886 when Geronimo surrendered.

A mill to process the low-grade copper ore was established in 1911 in nearby Hurley but was replaced by a new (current) Ivanhoe concentrator facility in 1982. Milling operations restarted in January 2004 at the Chino Concentrator after a three-year hiatus caused by low copper prices. Solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) operations started in 1988 and have run continuously since. Reserves of copper ore at Chino are expected to last until 2015.

A smelter in Hurley was commissioned in 1939 and was modernized in 1985 to increase capacity and achieve compliance with the Clean Air Act. In 2005, the smelter was permanently closed.

==Current operations==

In 2008, Chino&#x27;s parent company, Freeport-McMoRan, announced that it planned to suspend mining and milling activities at Chino, but would continue reclamation activities and copper production from its SX/EW plant. About 600 people from the work force of 830 would be laid off beginning about Feb. 13, 2009. The mine reopened in 2011.
As of January 2014, the operations employed approximately 1,035 people.

<text>The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC), colloquially referred to as Jeff&#x27;s Shed, is a group of three adjacent buildings next to the Yarra River in South Wharf, an inner-city suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The venues are owned and operated by the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Trust.

Following the opening of its expansion in 2018, Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre regained the status as being the largest convention and exhibition venue in Australia and one of the largest spaces in the Southern Hemisphere.

The total size of the MCEC is 70,000 square metres. The venue consists of 63 meeting rooms, outdoor courtyard spaces, a Plenary that can be divided into three self-contained acoustically separate theatres, the Goldfields Theatre a 9,000 square metre multi-purpose event space with a retractable 1,000-seat theatre and 39,000 square metres of pillarless exhibition space.

In 2017/18, 1,124 events were held at MCEC. These events attracted 950,385 delegates, including 23 international conventions involving 28,750 delegates and 34 national conventions which attracted 38,626 delegates.

In 2018/19, the MCEC contributed more than $1.10 billion in economic impact to the state of Victoria.

==Management==
The Melbourne Exhibition Centre Trust was created in August 1994 with the responsibility of overseeing the construction and development of the Melbourne Exhibition Centre. In February 1997, the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Trust began, replacing the previous trust with the added scope of the Melbourne Convention Centre, formerly called the World Congress Centre Melbourne. In August 1997, the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Trust became owner and venue manager of both the Melbourne Exhibition Centre and the Melbourne Convention Centre.

On 28 August 2002, the trust was appointed the Committee of Management of the Yarra River Maritime Reserve. The reserve is inclusive of the land and historic sheds located on the south bank of the Yarra River between Grimes Bridge and the Melbourne Maritime Museum. This appointment was revoked in June 2006 as part of the land consolidation process necessary for the development of the Melbourne Convention Centre and associated works referred to below.

The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Trust is also responsible for managing and promoting the use of the Royal Exhibition Building in the Carlton Gardens. As a government-owned trust, The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Trust is responsible to the Minister for Tourism.

==History ==

=== Melbourne Exhibition Centre ===
The Melbourne Exhibition Centre was opened on 14 February 1996 and is known colloquially as &quot;Jeff&#x27;s Shed&quot; after the then Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett.

The building was designed by Denton Corker Marshall, an architectural firm responsible for many of Melbourne&#x27;s larger buildings through the early 1990s, and features their characteristic &quot;blade&quot; entrance. The building was originally intended to be used by the Melbourne Museum but Jeff Kennett intervened during construction to have the building used as an exhibition centre. In 1998 a covered footbridge was erected between the Exhibition and Convention centres, parallel to the Spencer Street Bridge.
The building has become an icon in Melbourne due to the main entrance marked by a prominent tilted metal blade supported by a pair of yellow sticks in combination with the 450 metre urban verandah, parallel to the internal concourse, supported by a forest of smaller sticks. The verandah and the new riverside park make a major contribution to the public realm of the city.

=== Melbourne Convention Centre ===
The former Convention Centre on the Flinders Street side of the Yarra River was opened in May 1990 and has hosted thousands of conventions and meetings. 

The current Melbourne Convention Centre, on land adjacent to the Exhibition Centre, was opened on 5 June 2009. At a cost of A$1 billion, the development consists of a 5541-seat Plenary Hall that can be divided into three separate theatres, a grand banquet room as well as a hotel, office, residential and retail space. It was developed by a consortium led by Multiplex and Plenary Group and designed by Larry Oltmanns. The centre uses a range of features in order to achieve a 6 Star Green Star environmental rating and to become the first convention centre in the world with that rating. The architects for the development were NH Architecture and Woods Bagot.

=== Expansion ===
On 5 May 2015, the Victorian State Government announced $205 million for the expansion of Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre in the 2015/16 State Budget. This project commenced in May 2016 and opened on 1 July 2018. The 20,000-square-metre expansion includes 9,000 square metres of exhibition space plus additional flexible, multi-purpose event space, 1,000-seat theatre, multiple meeting rooms, a banquet room and a café and bar.

The building design was a joint venture between architect firms: NH Architecture and Woods Bagot. The expansion is part of a larger South Wharf expansion project by Plenary Group that includes a new 347-room Novotel Melbourne South Wharf and a new 1,150-space multi-level car park – all fully connected and integrated with existing buildings.

== Building design and architecture ==

=== Melbourne Exhibition Centre ===
The building resembles a long shed with separated operable walls (each valued at $250,000). This allows the space to be split from a maximum of 39,000 square metres to a minimum of 3,000 square metre spaces. The single volume with a proportion of length to width of approximately 2.5:1 was chosen. Other than the exhibition space, the building also has a basement that is able to hold 1,000 cars.
From the main entrance, visitors would be able to see the 450 metres southward vista of the concourse as well as the mezzanine balconies. On the first floor of the entry pavilion and extending along the mezzanine platform, there are meeting and function rooms which separates the double-height hall and concourse. Some have large windows overlooking the exhibition.

The site for the Exhibition Centre was previously the site for Daryl Jackson&#x27;s Museum of Victoria. The brief required DCM to work with the partially built concrete structure. According to Melbourne architect and critic Norman Day, the column-free space could be associated to the Russian Constructivist of the 1920s such as the Vesnin brothers&#x27;s Kiev railway station scheme 1926. Another relation to the Russian Constructivist is the cantilevered structure supported by yellow steel props as well as the large metal letters arranged over the top of the entrance.

The building consists of two different roof designs which are angled at different directions. This was due to the intention to create two different successful spaces which is the exhibition space and the public space (concourse of the building). By this method, the architects manage to create two different environments, one which is an enclosed exhibition space and another is the concourse which is open to the public.

Due to the brief that required the building to be constructed in a short amount of time and save cost, a repetitive system of identical trusses clad in aluminium sheet were used. On top of that, the trusses have to be solid in order to provide sound isolation from one hall to the next. At the same time, in order to reduce the span, and to stiffen them laterally, the architects tapered them in cross section.
The two rows of columns that are located in the verandah (the building’s long frontage facing the river) are intended to give a subtle separation of the interior and exterior of the building.

The blades which are located along the concourse are coloured in a series of Francis-Bacon-inspired colours, with hall numbers stencilled on. This serves as a double purpose of punctuating the linear volume and labelling the halls.

===Significance and contribution to Australian architecture===
The aerodynamic treatment of the colonnade canopy, which disperses wind, influenced another Melbourne architect, Peter Elliott, in the design of the Spencer Street Footbridge in 1999.

== Awards ==
The Melbourne Convention Centre was awarded the Australian Construction Achievement Award in 2010.

The Melbourne Exhibition Centre was awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture in 1996.

2018 Melbourne Award - contribution to profile by a corporation - Club Melbourne Ambassador Program.

Premier&#x27;s Sustainability Awards 2018 - Government category for Melbourne Energy Renewable Project.

Australian Business Awards - Employer of Choice 2018 and 2017.

==Notable events==
===Melbourne Art Fair===

The inaugural Melbourne Art Fair, a commercial art fair, was held in 1988 in the Royal Exhibition Building, started by a group of gallery-owners. It continued as a biennial event, exhibiting works from Australian and international galleries, with sales of , from 2003 being run by the new not-for-profit Melbourne Art Foundation. The fair was paused in 2016 owing to lack of interest from galleries, but relaunched in a smaller form in a temporary venue in Southbank.

In 2020 it moved to its permanent new home at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, with the aim of showcasing both major galleries and &quot;progressive young galleries&quot;. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, its scheduled run in June 2020 had to be instead changed into on online version, running 1–7 June and showing artworks from the Asia-Pacific region from 40 galleries. The next fair is scheduled for 17–20 February 2022.

The fair is endorsed by the Art Galleries Association of Australia (AAGA) and is supported by the federal government via the Australia Council for the Arts and the Government of Victoria via Creative Victoria.

=== PAX Australia ===
The first international edition of gaming exhibition and festival Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) was held in 2013 at the Melbourne Showgrounds.

Shortly following the hugely successful inaugural event, it was announced that the 2014 edition would be held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. The MCEC has since become the permanent home of PAX Australia, with the event held annually in either October or November (with the exception of the scheduled 2020 and 2021 shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the events being held online instead). In 2022, a reported 23,000 people attended the event.

PAX has coincided with GCAP and Melbourne International Games Week since 2014, which is supported by the Government of Victoria via Creative Victoria. It is currently the only PAX outside of the US.

<doc id="781848" wikidata="Q2264362" url="?curid=781848" title="Raistlin Majere">
<text>Raistlin Majere is a fictional character from the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series of books created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. Raistlin played an extensive role in the two main series of books, particularly in &quot;Dragonlance Legends&quot; in which he was both primary protagonist and antagonist. He is twin brother to Caramon Majere, half-brother to his protective sister Kitiara uth Matar, and a significant member of the Heroes of the Lance. In the animated movie adaptation, &quot;&quot;, Raistlin was voiced by Kiefer Sutherland.

Born to a mother prone to trance-like fits and a woodcutter father, Raistlin inherited his mother&#x27;s aptitude for magic. He undertook and passed the arduous Test of High Sorcery, but in the process, he acquired white hair and golden skin and was cursed with hourglass eyes which saw the effects of time on all things. His health, while never robust, was ruined further, leaving him weak and subject to frequent bouts of coughing blood. Initially wearing the red robes of neutrality, as the first series progresses Raistlin&#x27;s powers increase while his mood and actions darken, and he adopts the black robes of evil during the War of the Lance.

Raistlin, although physically very weak, is extremely intelligent, and possesses uncommonly powerful magical abilities. While ruthless in his pursuit of power, he holds to a code of conduct which repays all debts and protects those disadvantaged through no fault of their own. His relationship with his much stronger, better-liked, and good-natured twin brother Caramon is fraught with tensions as Caramon seeks to protect and shelter his weaker brother while denying his cruelty and penchant for hurting any others while in pursuit of his goals.

==Publication history==
Some of characters of the Heroes of the Lance were introduced in a series of stories published in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine; the first of these was &quot;The test of the twins&quot; in &quot;Dragon&quot; #83 (March 1984), a story featuring twin brothers Raistlin and Caramon.

==Character profile==
Raistlin Majere was created by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman as one of several characters to be involved in an epic &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign which they had written and designed. This was the beginning of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; saga. Raistlin was given to one of the players, Terry Phillips, to play. As Margaret Weis describes in the foreword of her prequel book, &quot;The Soulforge&quot;, Terry Phillips is the man responsible for much of Raistlin&#x27;s sarcastic and caustic character, taking it to depths that neither she nor Hickman had ever imagined. Raistlin is also Margaret Weis&#x27;s favorite character. According to Hickman in the foreword to &quot;The Soulforge&quot;, &quot;[we] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone in the room was both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [Weis] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night.&quot; According to Weis, &quot;People can identify with Raistlin. We can relate to feelings that nobody loves us, to the struggle for recognition and acceptance. I really understood Raistlin right off the bat.&quot;

Raistlin is best described as the archetypal antihero or tragic hero. He is a Wizard of High Sorcery who first bears the red robes that mark him as a worshipper of Lunitari. During the five years in which the future Heroes of the Lance go their separate ways, Raistlin takes the Test of High Sorcery at the Tower of Wayreth, where he acquires golden skin and is cursed with hourglass eyes that cause him to see time as it affects all things. (This appearance was originally invented by &quot;Dragonlance&quot; cover artist Larry Elmore, &quot;because it would look just great&quot;). He also becomes even more frail and sickly than before. In Raistlin&#x27;s vision, all things wither and die before him; however, long-lived races such as elves only appear to age slightly, while the Irda do not appear to age at all. Raistlin views magic as a way to compensate for lacking the physical strength and personal charisma that his brother has, and for the inadequacy he feels about having to rely on others.

A torn individual, Raistlin exhibits a strong superiority complex (as far as his power in magic and his intelligence are concerned), and knows almost nothing of true loyalty to others (although, despite this, Raistlin usually keeps his promises and pays his debts). He only follows Tanis Half-Elven, the unofficial leader of the companions, because he feels that doing so will ultimately benefit him (At one point, early in &quot;Dragons of Winter Night&quot; he tells Laurana: &quot;I do not follow Tanis. We are merely traveling in the same direction... for the time being.&quot;). He is also condescending and extremely resentful regarding his lack of physical strength, especially as he is often forced to rely on his twin brother for support, generating feelings of jealousy towards his twin rather than feelings of affection and gratitude. Raistlin harbors a secret hate for his twin&#x27;s physical power and easygoing manner, and for the attention and comradeship it seems to earn him, as Raistlin&#x27;s own appearance and secretive nature causes others to be mistrustful and apprehensive. Caramon, conversely, holds Raistlin in high regard and tries to protect him.

These factors ultimately culminate in Raistlin&#x27;s turn to evil. He dons the black robes worn by evil wizards (those who worship Nuitari) and eventually rises to become the most powerful mortal on Krynn (through a deal he made with the ancient archmage Fistandantilus during his test in the Tower of High Sorcery). 

Contrary to his usual nature, Raistlin holds a soft spot for others who are treated poorly because of weaknesses that are not their fault (such as gully dwarves). He befriends the gully dwarf Bupu through his kindness. He identifies with such people and is thus quick to help them as he is quick to help himself. There are also rare instances when Raistlin feels genuine regret that he cannot return to the times of his childhood when he was capable of feeling love, a common lament throughout the series.

==Early life==
As described in the fantasy novel &quot;The Soulforge&quot;, Raistlin Majere and his twin brother Caramon were born in the town of Solace, Abanasinia, to a woodcutter named Gilon Majere and his wife, Rosamun (who, because she possessed magical abilities but was forced to suppress it by her upbringing, had a habit of slipping into uncontrollable trances). They were preceded by an older half-sister, Kitiara uth Matar, the product of Rosamun&#x27;s first marriage to a purported ex-Solamnic Knight, Gregor uth Matar. Raistlin was born sickly and on the verge of death. In fact, the midwife felt that the baby Raistlin should be allowed to die as an act of mercy. Only due to Kitiara&#x27;s stubborn refusal to let him die (and subsequent treatment and care) did he finally overcome the infantile ailment and live.

Possibly as a result of this early illness, Raistlin was always a sickly child, but possessed a fierce intellect, in stark contrast to his slow-thinking, but not unintelligent, physically stronger twin. In fact, according to the common lore of the world of Krynn (supported by statements made by the god, Paladine, in the closing chapters of &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot;), identical twins were considered to be one person split in two. For this reason, Raistlin believed he had been given the mind, and Caramon the body.

Kitiara, still driven by a desire to find a use for her brothers, was annoyed by Raistlin for this same reason. She knew Caramon would make a great warrior, but she did not know what to do with his brother. The answer came when a powerful archmagus of the White Robes, named Antimodes, stopped for a night in Solace. Kitiara, after much effort, persuaded the archmage to talk to Raistlin, who impressed the archmage with intellect and wisdom beyond what Antimodes felt should be possessed by a child of six. He was also frightened by another trait Raistlin possessed: the desire to control others. However, after this meeting, Antimodes personally saw to Raistlin&#x27;s enrollment in a school for magic, even paying for his first semester&#x27;s tuition.

As years passed, Raistlin learned the basics of the arcane tongue from his schoolmaster, and was taunted and isolated by his schoolmates who termed him &quot;the Sly One&quot;. However, Raistlin, rather than being upset by this lack of acceptance, enjoyed the fact they feared him enough to try to destroy him. When the time came for his first test of magic, a test conducted by writing the words &quot;I, Magus&quot; on a lambskin which would burn into the skin if he possessed the ability, at first nothing happened. After a desperate prayer to the three gods of magic, who visited him and made him swear to worship them, the words lit up with such ferocity that the skin was utterly consumed.

It would be several more years before Raistlin finally learned to cast his first spell. The twins were sixteen. While Raistlin was away for his schooling, a widow by the name of Judith began to take care of Rosamun, the twin&#x27;s and Kitiara&#x27;s mother. Widow Judith was a believer in the snake god Belzor, who had a growing following; it appeared as if Judith was of great help for Rosamun, for their mother showed evidence of much improvement under the widow&#x27;s care...nevertheless, Raistlin was not fond of the woman, and she held him in disdain for his interests in magic.

His father, Gilon, was mortally injured in a terrible logging accident and was brought back to Solace just in time to say a few last words to his sons. Widow Judith comforted the distraught Rosamun, insisting that the god Belzor would perform a miraculous healing for her husband. When Gilon died, Widow Judith argued that it had been Rosamun&#x27;s lack of faith, her daughter Kitiara&#x27;s unsavory lifestyle, and Raistlin&#x27;s study of magic which caused the god to forsake Gilon in his time of need. When Raistlin spoke out against Judith&#x27;s claims, the woman made to attack him. The people of Solace had apparently heard enough, for they ran Widow Judith out of town. Rosamun, struck dumb by the sudden loss of her husband, fell into one of her trances, sinking so deep that she never re-emerged. She died three days later. At her funeral, driven nearly senseless and hallucinating with his grief, Raistlin showed great disregard for the inclement weather that oversaw it and fell into a deep fever. He only survived due to the unexpected return of Kitiara, who fought death over her brother once more and, like before, defeated it. It was after Raistlin&#x27;s recovery when Caramon was overcome by terrible dreams, that Raistlin finally learned what it took to use the magic and cast a sleeping spell over his brother.

Raistlin and his brother formed a friendship with other citizens of Solace who would one day become their fellow Heroes of the Lance. These friendships and the mentorship of Flint Fireforge and Tanis Half-Elven helped fill the gap that the sudden loss of their parents had created. Raistlin&#x27;s skills continued to grow even as he developed a love for herbalism and played an instrumental role in saving Solace from a plague.

In the twins’ early twenties, they accompanied Flint, Tanis, and the kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, to Haven for a market fair. It was there that Raistlin encountered the cult of the false god Belzor, and where he again met the Renegade Wizard, Judith, who was using magic to bamboozle the townspeople into believing in her. By revealing she was using magic and not the powers of a god (by casting a spell of his own), Raistlin proved that she was a charlatan, destroying her cult and at the same time invoking the wrath of the townspeople against himself, coming dangerously close to being burned at the stake.

However, the spell Raistlin had used was illegal for him to cast, as an untested mage, by the law of the Conclave of Wizards. Rather than discipline him, less than one year later, the Conclave decided to summon Raistlin to the Tower of High Sorcery at Wayreth Forest to take the Test. This in itself was astonishing for no one so young had ever taken the grueling test, which touted death as the price of failure. Raistlin and his brother left Solace, being unable by Conclave law to tell anyone where they were going, and made their way to the Tower.

==The Test==

&quot;The Soulforge&quot;, which is the true account of Raistlin&#x27;s Test according to Astinus of Palanthus, finds Raistlin in the Inn Between on the outskirts of the town of Haven. After being invited to drink with three elves, named Liam, Micah, and Renet, they offer Raistlin a job. They need a mage to go into the house of the town&#x27;s mageware shop, owned by Lemuel, a friend of Raistlin&#x27;s, in order to rob it of the treasures said to be there. Raistlin, initially planning to warn Lemuel, agrees to go in after the elves tell him that they know of secret spellbooks hidden in the shop. After entering the house and going into the basement alone, Raistlin encounters the evil Fistandantilus. Realizing that he is taking the Test and that the elves (in actuality powerful dark-elf mages themselves) will kill him for even speaking with Fistandantilus, the evil lich offers him a bargain: Raistlin&#x27;s life force in exchange for the power to pass the Test and defeat the elves.

Raistlin accepts, and when Fistandantilus unlocks the basement door after teaching Raistlin a spell, the elves attack, casting a magical fireball too quickly for Raistlin to react. In desperation and out of instinct, Raistlin throws up his hands to stop the fireball that is hurtling towards him. However, instead of obliterating him, it &quot;burst on him, over him, around him. It burst harmlessly, its effects dissipated, showering him with sparks and globs of flame that struck his hands and astonished face and then vanished in a sizzle, as if they were falling into standing water.&quot; Raistlin casts the spell learned from Fistandantilus and kills the three dark elves.

After the battle, Raistlin notices that his skin has turned a gold color, forming a magical armor that had protected him from the fireball. Fistandantilus denies that he created the armor for Raistlin, telling Raistlin that it is an armor of his own making. Realizing that this armor will protect him from Fistandantilus taking his life force, Raistlin reneges on his bargain. As he leaves the cellar, an enraged Fistandantilus threatens Raistlin, telling him that his Test is not yet over and that if even a crack should appear in the armor, Fistandantilus will take the life promised to him.

Finding himself magically transported back to the Tower of Wayreth, Raistlin believes his Test is over. Feeling a breath of air hitting his neck, Raistlin manages to turn his body, changing what would have been an instantly killing knife thrust into one that does severe damage but leaves him alive. Liam, one of the dark elves, had survived the spell in the basement. In pain and failing strength, Raistlin overcomes the deeply wounded dark elf and kills Liam with his own blade. Raistlin realizes that the blade Liam wielded had been covered with poison, and passes out, expecting to die.

Raistlin regains consciousness to find his brother, Caramon, walking towards him. Caramon picks Raistlin up, intending to bring his brother out of the Tower and away from the Test, which inflames Raistlin&#x27;s feelings of weakness. As Caramon carries his brother out, the floating head of Fistandantilus appears, intent on taking what little life force Raistlin has left. As Raistlin prepares to cast a final spell that he knows will kill him in his weakened state, Caramon suddenly conjures lightning that strikes the floating head. After another blast of Caramon&#x27;s magic lightning, the head of Fistandantilus disappears, leaving Raistlin to wonder what just happened. Caramon tells Raistlin that the spell was something he could always do, but since he preferred sword and shield, he had never told Raistlin. Raistlin snaps:

&quot;It wasn&#x27;t the physical pain that clouded his mind. It was the old inner pain clawing at him, tearing at him with poisoned talons. Caramon, strong and cheerful, good and kind, open and honest. Caramon, everyone&#x27;s friend. Not like Raistlin—the runt, the Sly One. All I ever had was my magic,&#x27; Raistlin said, speaking clearly, thinking clearly for the first time in his life. &#x27;And now you have that, too.&#x27; Using the wall for support, Raistlin raised both his hands, put his thumbs together. He began speaking the words, the words that would summon the magic...Beneath the layer of cold, hard rock, jealously bubbled and seethed. Tremors split the rock. Jealousy, red and molten, coursed through Raistlin&#x27;s body and flamed out of his hands. The fire flared, billowed, and engulfed Caramon.&quot;

After Caramon&#x27;s death, Fistandantilus comes to claim Raistlin&#x27;s life, reaching into Raistlin&#x27;s chest and grabbing his heart. Raistlin grabs at the mage&#x27;s wrist, telling Fistandantilus that while he may take his life, he would serve Raistlin in return.

Raistlin later learns that he did not, in fact, kill his brother. The Caramon in the tower had been an illusion created by Par-Salian, formed to show Raistlin the depths of his own hatred and arrogance. The real Caramon had been a witness to his brother&#x27;s fratricide, in the hopes of severing the connection between the two brothers. This plan backfired, however, as Caramon forgives Raistlin, believing him to not be in his right mind because of the Test, and with Raistlin&#x27;s health severely crippled, Raistlin is even more dependent on his brother than ever. Any memory of Fistandantilus is gone (Par-Salian believing that this was Fistandantilus&#x27;s own doing, so Raistlin would not fight him), and Raistlin believes his health has been destroyed due to the battle with Liam. Par-Salian, in order to teach Raistlin compassion and patience, curses him with the eyes of the sorceress Raelana, turning his pupils into an hourglass shape that shows him the effect of time on everything: &quot;Youth withers before those eyes, beauty fades, mountains crumble to dust&quot;. As compensation for what he deems a necessary cruelty, Par-Salian gives Raistlin the Staff of Magius, one of the most powerful magical artifacts in existence, as well as a recipe for herbal tea that will help relieve Raistlin&#x27;s now constant and wracking cough. Told to never tell anyone the story of what had happened in the Tower, the two brothers leave, with Raistlin now wearing the Red Robes of Neutrality. The Staff grants Raistlin numerous magical powers. The change in Raistlin between when he lacks and possesses the Staff has been compared to the difference between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

==Mercenary Work==

Not long after Raistlin left the Tower of High Sorcery, he and his brother found themselves in financial straits. It was also at this time that they heard of an army of mercenaries (led by the Mad Baron of Langtree) - information given to them by the white-robed wizard Antimodes, a close friend of Par-Salian. During this period Raistlin and Caramon encountered two new friends: a brown-robed mage (brown robes given to those who never take the test) named Horkin, and a half-kender named Scrounger.

During this same period, Kitiara had traveled to Sanction and met Ariakas: the man who was currently favored by Takhisis. Ariakas did not yet trust Kitiara, and he gave her a mission to lure Immolatus, a red dragon, to his command. The dragon, embittered by the loss of his treasure, had declined orders to join forces with Ariakas. Kitiara&#x27;s guile and quick-thinking led to her triumphant return to Ariakas with a dragon in tow.

It was when Raistlin first encountered Immolatus that a new ability of Raistlin&#x27;s cursed eyes was revealed. Upon encountering a dragon garbed in mortal guise, he could see partially through its transformation. In the book &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, the first encounter with Immolatus is described as such:

What Raistlin saw was a blurred portrait, two faces instead of one, two faces in a botched painting, as if the artist had allowed all the colors to run together. One face was the face of a human wizard. The other face was more difficult to see, but Raistlin had a fleeting impression of red, vibrant red, glittering red. There was something reptilian about the man, something reptilian about his second face. (298)

Immolatus mistakenly thought that Raistlin was a descendant of Magius, for he possessed the Staff of Magius. After Raistlin was intimidated by the disguised red dragon, he escaped the tent and returned to his own army&#x27;s camp. It was Immolatus&#x27; mission to locate for Takhisis the eggs of the gold and silver dragons that lay in the mountains where the nearby city of Hope&#x27;s End was besieged. Raistlin and Caramon, taking their wounded to a temple that had once belonged to Paladine, Leader of the gods of Light, found themselves exploring it, along with Scrounger. It was there that the twins ran into Immolatus again. At the conclusion of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, Raistlin and Caramon remain with the army.

==Involvement in the War of the Lance==
After Raistlin passed his Test in &quot;Brothers Majere&quot;, Ansalon was engulfed in the conflict that would be known as the War of the Lance. During this time, Raistlin helped to fight the darkness threatening to consume all of Krynn. He and his companions played a critical role, and would collectively become known as the Heroes of the Lance. Raistlin&#x27;s magic powers increased at a dramatic rate as the war progressed. He gained control of a potent artifact known as the Dragon Orb of Silvanesti which he took from the dying elven King Lorac Caladon.

While caught in Lorac&#x27;s Dragon Orb-induced dream he makes his first appearance donning black robes. To that point he had not yet converted to the side of evil. However his presence in the dream donning black served as foreshadowing. A common device in the early parts of the Chronicles series is Raistlin&#x27;s hearing of an unknown voice in his mind. During this dream Raistlin hears this mysterious voice telling him that in order to save his life and the life of his comrades he must be willing to accept the black robes. Later while dying in the Library of Palanthas he pledges his loyalty to the God of Evil Magic, Nuitari, and accepts the black robes.

&quot;Dragons of the Hourglass Mage&quot; details Raistlin&#x27;s adventures in Neraka after becoming a wizard of the Black Robe and chronicles the significant maturation of the character between his introduction in &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot; and later appearances, addressing many previously-unanswered questions. In this lord city ruled by the Dark Queen, Raistlin discovers that Takhisis means to take control of all magic, and must stop her from doing so.

His acceptance of the black robes, however, was not approved by the Conclave, effectively making Raistlin a renegade wizard. It wasn&#x27;t until later when Raistlin has manipulated events to put himself in a position of power over the Conclave, that he demanded they make no effort to hunt him or to interfere with him in any way. The Conclave agreed, and Raistlin&#x27;s intervention prevented the death knight Lord Soth from destroying the Tower of Wayreth and the wizards within.

Fistandantilus was able to petition the Dark Queen for a mysterious item known as the Key of Knowledge, which Raistlin was able to use to unlock a number of ancient tomes and gain vast power in the process. His ambition, however, was such that he betrayed the Dark Queen, ultimately bringing the War of the Lance to an end and leaving him as the most powerful force on Krynn.

He then took up residence in the Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas, fulfilling an ancient prophecy that had foreseen his appearance as the Master of Past and Present. He spent two years inside the Tower, learning its secrets, studying spells and experimenting.

Such was his power then that two years later, the historian Astinus, in &quot;Time of the Twins&quot;, described Raistlin&#x27;s entry into the Tower as this:
Two years ago, he entered the Tower of High Sorcery. He entered in the dead of night in darkness, the only moon in the sky was the moon that sheds no light. He walked through the Shoikan Grove - a stand of accursed oak trees that no mortal, not even those of the Kender race, dare approach. He made his way to the gates upon which hung still the body of the evil mage who, with his dying breath, cast the curse upon the Tower and leapt from the upper windows, impaling himself upon its gates - a fearsome watchman. But when &quot;he&quot; came there, the watchman bowed before him, the gates opened at his touch, then they shut behind him. And they have not opened again these past two years. He has not left, and if any had been admitted, none have seen them. (11 &amp; 12)

==&quot;Legends&quot;==

Raistlin&#x27;s attempt at godhood was chronicled in the &quot;Dragonlance Legends Trilogy&quot;. The plans he has made drive the conflict in &quot;Time of the Twins&quot;, the first novel in the series. The trilogy also explored the relationship between Raistlin and his twin Caramon.

Although the Conclave had previously believed that Raistlin harbored plans to conquer the world, they later learned, through Raistlin&#x27;s apprentice (and Conclave spy), Dalamar, that Raistlin&#x27;s ambition stretched much further than this. Raistlin studied Fistandantilus&#x27;s voluminous works on crossing the threshold between god and man, and decided to embark on an attempt to kill Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness, and take her place among the gods. He became arrogant after the final victory over the dragons, and to attain godly power he sought the help of dark forces. To recover knowledge lost during the Cataclysm, Raistlin travelled backwards through time to just before it, during the reign of the Kingpriest. Challenging the still-living Fistandantilus, Raistlin wins the duel and steals the archmage&#x27;s identity, memories, and life force. The white wizard Par-Salian sent Caramon, the cleric of Paladine Crysania, and, by accident, the kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot to the same time period in a desperate attempt to stop him. The presence of Tasslehoff horrified Par-Salian, as unlike humans, elves, ogres, and dragons, kender (who came into being by accident, not a creation of the gods) are capable of changing time. Crysania&#x27;s presence was an effort to wake her from a coma brought on by a confrontation with the death knight Lord Soth, something only the Kingpriest of Istar could accomplish. This played into Raistlin&#x27;s plans, as the Abyss, the realm in which Takhisis resided, had to be accessed through a gateway which could only be opened through the combined actions of a black-robed wizard of purest evil and a priest of Paladine of purest good.

Tasslehoff, at Raistlin&#x27;s prompting, remained in Istar in an effort to stop the Cataclysm by activating a time-travel device given to Caramon so that he (alone) could return to their time, in the Temple of Istar. It was the intent of the wizards for Crysania to either follow the true priests who were gathered unto the gods prior to the Cataclysm, or die when the fiery mountain struck Istar, thereby thwarting Raistlin&#x27;s plans. The instructions Raistlin gave Tasslehoff dismantled the device instead, as Raistlin&#x27;s plan was to leave Tas dead by the Cataclysm so he could not alter history. Instead, he is forced into the Abyss where he manages to escape with the assistance of an also-trapped gnome, whose ingenuity managed to repair the time-travel device. Raistlin, Caramon, and the now-awakened Crysania escape the Cataclysm and travel forward in time to Dwarfgate Wars, which are initiated by Raistlin in order to access the portal to the Abyss in Zhaman. In the guise of Fistandantilus, Raistlin attempts to open the portal. Tas and his gnome companion arrive and return the time-travel device to Caramon, whose simultaneous use of the device with Raistlin&#x27;s powerful magic results in a titanic explosion. Unlike the actual Fistandantilus, Raistlin is able to control the magical fluctuations and enter the Abyss with Crysania. As Raistlin made his way through the Abyss to confront Takhisis, Crysania bore the brunt of all the attacks of Takhisis&#x27; minions. As her life was spent, Raistlin left Crysania to die, having used her fully.

The magical explosion pushes Caramon and Tasslehoff into the future, where it is revealed that Raistlin was successful in defeating Takhisis and has gone on to destroy the other gods and all life on Krynn. Caramon and Tas trek through the ruined Krynn, to the remains of the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth. There they find Par-Salian, trapped as a half-human statue of marble, being tortured by the spirit of Raistlin. Also there is Astinus, the mortal form of the god Gilean, writing his final entries into the Chronicles of Krynn. Pressed for whatever information he can give them before dying, Par-Salian tells Caramon and Tas that to prevent this future from happening, Raistlin must not be allowed to leave the Abyss. Unable to create new life, Raistlin becomes the sole living creature in the universe, a snake devouring its own tail.

Caramon and Tasselhoff attempt to stop Raistlin by returning to the time when Raistlin is on his way to lure the Queen of Darkness out of the Abyss, at the Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthus. Caramon confronts Raistlin with his experience of the future and Raistlin&#x27;s solitary, meaningless existence. After dragging the memory from Caramon&#x27;s experience of the future, Raistlin was convinced of what Caramon warned. Raistlin tells his twin to take Crysania back to Krynn and gives up his life preventing Takhisis from passing through the portal. Though grieved at Raistlin&#x27;s fate, Caramon has a vision of Paladine rescuing Raistlin&#x27;s spirit and the story is retold throughout Krynn which leads to Raistlin becoming a popular hero.

==Raistlin&#x27;s return==
In the later short story, &quot;The Legacy&quot;, Caramon&#x27;s son Palin is summoned for his Test, winding up at the Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthas. Dalamar attempted to bring an illusion of Raistlin there for Palin&#x27;s Test; however, Raistlin summoned himself there. In his monologue, he states: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it for you, mages! I didn&#x27;t do it for the conclave! I didn&#x27;t do it for my brother! I had one more debt to pay in my lifetime. Now I have discharged it.&quot; It has been revealed by Margaret Weis that this &quot;last debt&quot; was to magic itself.

Raistlin returned again, a year later, during the Chaos War. He was instrumental in the defeat of Chaos, even though the gods had stripped him of his power as the price for his hubris.

Raistlin&#x27;s spirit also assisted the gods to find Krynn at the conclusion of the War of Souls, after Takhisis who was claiming to be the &quot;One God&quot; stole Krynn and transported it to another part of the galaxy. His soul is still lingering because he refuses to go on unless it is with his brother Caramon. He was able to locate Krynn because he could sense Tasslehoff Burrfoot using the device of time journey. Then, with his brother Caramon and the Heroes of the Lance, Raistlin finally joined the River of Souls, and disappeared for the final time.

==Raistlin&#x27;s daughter==
The heroine of &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; is a new character, and according to Margaret Weis, &quot;a woman who may or may not be Raistlin&#x27;s daughter&quot;.

A legend that sprung up after the events in &quot;Test of the Twins&quot; was the story of &quot;Raistlin&#x27;s daughter&quot;, which tells of Raistlin having a daughter with an Irda. Caramon denied the story, though if it were true he would have no memory of the event. During the Chaos War, Usha Majere, a human girl reared by the Irda, was introduced. She suspected that she was Raistlin&#x27;s daughter, but Raistlin denied it when he encountered her, stating that Usha was born of two human parents and was certainly no daughter of his. He also asserted that no magic in the world could steal the knowledge of having been loved.

==Family tree==
==Other media==

===Gamebooks===
Terry Phillips, who played Raistlin as a player character in the games Tracy Hickman ran as part of developing &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, authored the Super Endless Quest gamebook &quot;The Soulforge&quot;. This gamebook allowed the reader to take the role of Raistlin and attempt to pass the Test of High Sorcery.
===Video games===
Raistlin appears as one of the player characters in &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance&quot;. Raistlin wields a magic staff and is able to cast eight spells.

In &quot;The Dark Queen of Krynn&quot;, the player characters must save Raistlin who is imprisoned in the Abyss.

===Miniature figures===
Raistlin was included in Ral Partha&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance Heroes&quot; boxed figures set of lead miniatures. A reviewer for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine complimented the work Ral Partha did in matching the appearance of their figures to the descriptions of the characters from the novels, and described his figure: &quot;Raistlin is the picture of a mage casting a spell. He wears a long, fringed, hooded robe with a cape reaching to his ankles. His boots are plain, but his belt is woven. His face is set in concentration. Clutched in his upraised left hand is his staff, which ends in a large gnarled hand clutching a crystal ball. A wealth of well-detailed spell components hangs from his belt.&quot;

===Music===
References to Raistlin have appeared in several other media, most notably in heavy metal music. The Swedish band Lake of Tears recorded a song called &quot;Raistlin and the Rose&quot; for its 1997 album &quot;Crimson Cosmos&quot;. &quot;The Soulforged&quot;, by German metal band Blind Guardian, is another song inspired by Raistlin&#x27;s story. The song appears on the band&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;A Night at the Opera.&quot; &quot;Wishmaster&quot;, a song by Finnish metal band Nightwish also pays tribute to Raistlin. Among other references, the song uses the word &quot;Shalafi&quot; (the elven word for &quot;master&quot;, used by Dalamar toward Raistlin), and there is a lyric that reads &quot;if you hear the call of arcane lore / your world shall rest on earth no more.&quot; The song first appeared on the 2001 album of the same name. The song is one of the most popular among the fans and is still played in concerts. In 2010 a Russian musical titled &quot;Последнее испытание (The Last Trial)&quot; emerged, telling the whole story of Legends in 39 songs, written over more than 10 years by Anton Kruglov and Helena Khanpira.

===&quot;Dragonlance&quot; movie===

Kiefer Sutherland headlined the animated movie &quot;&quot;, voicing Raistlin, who was one of the main characters in the film. Sutherland was selected, according to co-executive producer Cindi Rice, &quot;because he is an amazing actor but he also has a distinctive voice, with a naturally raspy, breathy quality, which we felt would help convey Raistlin&#x27;s distinctive illness and quiet power.&quot; The tag line of the movie &quot;Chaos. War. Death. This is what I see.&quot; is a quote from Raistlin.

==Reception==
The character was popular enough for Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman to base the &quot;Dragonlance Legends Trilogy&quot; around the character&#x27;s relationship with his twin. The final book of the trilogy &quot;Test of the Twins&quot; appeared on the NY Times bestseller list for several weeks in 1986.

Jason Heller, of The A.V. Club, described Raistlin as &quot;Dragonlance&#x27;s breakout star&quot;, referring to him as &quot;Dragonlance&#x27;s sarcastic, scene-stealing son of a bitch&quot; and &quot;the eerie, complicated protagonist-bordering-on-antagonist who didn&#x27;t do much to hide his contempt for people and lust for power&quot;. Hellers calls the twin brothers Caramon and Raistlin the series&#x27;s most compelling characters: &quot;Caramon is a large, powerful, goodhearted, slightly childlike warrior; Raistlin is a sickly, complicated, mysterious, morally iffy magician. The dynamic feels like it&#x27;s lifted straight from Thor and Loki, and that archetypal resonance is what Weis and Hickman are obviously shooting for. And almost entirely hit.&quot;

Lauren Davis of io9 commented on Raistlin: &quot;The most memorable character from the Dragonlance series, the one whose name is almost synonymous with the books, is Raistlin Majere. Weis and Hickman have often commented that Hickman is better at writing noble characters and Weis better at writing darker ones, and Raistlin is Weis&#x27; signature.&quot;

Raistlin Majere was #2 on &quot;Game Rant&quot;&#x27;s 2020 &quot;10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome&quot; list — the article states that &quot;Many regard Raistlin as the most powerful mage who has ever lived. Adventurers who meet Raistlin may encounter him as a full-fledged Wizard. In this form, he possesses golden skin and hourglass eyes that pierce through the veil of time– and with it, whatever vision of the past or the future that awaits the campaign.&quot;

Philosopher Christopher Robichaud considered Raistlin Majere to be &quot;the greatest &quot;D&amp;D&quot; character ever&quot;.

In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken described Raistlin as &quot;The breakout character of the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series&quot; and that although his red robes mark him as neutral (as white robes are good, and black robes are evil), &quot;everyone except his brother mistrusts him. Everyone else constantly assumes he&#x27;s secretly planning something evil, even though he never does anything evil in &quot;Autumn Twilight&quot;. He&#x27;s very caustic and solitary, which is quite understandable in my opinion.&quot;

Bricken later commented that in &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot;, &quot;Raistlin finally goes full black robes, first by teleporting himself off the maelstrom-bound ship, abandoning everyone else, including his devastated twin brother Caramon&quot; but noted that &quot;Weis and Hickman manage to give the new black mage shades of gray by having him join the forces of Takhisis, only to help Tanis kill the goddess&#x27; most powerful acolyte, Emperor Ariakis. Then Raistlin allows Berem to return the gem to the column to lock the divine dragon away.&quot; Bricken adds that Raistlin &quot;makes clear he&#x27;s done all of this because it&#x27;s made him the most powerful force of evil on Krynn, but then he still saves Tasslehoff and Tika from death. He&#x27;s evil, but he still has a soft side in there somewhere, which has caused him to be one of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&#x27; most beloved characters.&quot;

<doc id="781863" wikidata="Q284395" url="?curid=781863" title="The Bridges of Madison County">
<text>The Bridges of Madison County (also published as Love in Black and White) is a 1992 best-selling romance novel by American writer Robert James Waller that tells the story of an Italian-American World War II war bride living on a farm in 1960s Madison County, Iowa. While her husband and children are away at the State Fair, she engages in an affair with a &quot;National Geographic&quot; photographer from Bellingham, Washington, who is visiting Madison County to create a photographic essay on the covered bridges in the area. The novel is presented as a novelization of a true story, but it is in fact entirely fictional.

The novel is one of the bestselling books of the 20th century, with 50 million copies sold worldwide. It was adapted into a feature film in 1995 and a musical in 2013.

==Background==
Without expecting to, Robert James Waller conceived of &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; in the early 1990s. On leave from his teaching job at the University of Northern Iowa, Waller was photographing the Mississippi River with a friend when he decided to photograph the covered bridges of Madison County, Iowa. This event, alongside a song Waller wrote years earlier about &quot;the dreams of a woman named Francesca&quot;, gave him the idea for the novel, which he completed in eleven days. After he had written &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, Waller came to believe that he had based the character of Francesca Johnson on his wife, Georgia, whom Francesca physically resembles.

==Analysis==
According to Marc Eliot, Waller&#x27;s novella is a modernization of the Noël Coward play &quot;Still Life&quot; (1934), which was adapted into David Lean&#x27;s film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945). &quot;Still Life&quot; is about &quot;the desperation, guilt, and temptations of two married people who meet, fall in love, commit adultery, and then separate forever&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brigitte Weeks said that &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; had appealed to &quot;middle-aged, world-weary people&quot; in a manner similar to the writings of James A. Michener, though it features more sexuality than Michener&#x27;s books. &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; received multiple comparisons to Erich Segal&#x27;s &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970) for its plot and prose. For &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers said that Waller&#x27;s prose was modeled on Walt Whitman&#x27;s work, but instead resembled a greeting card. Travers also said that &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; exists within a tradition of &quot;great romantic crocks&quot; like Pat Conroy&#x27;s &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; (1986). &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; found the novella&#x27;s prose comparable to that of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; (1970) by Richard Bach. &quot;The Independent&quot; Nicolette Jones found the novella reminiscent of the books published by Mills &amp; Boon, while Owen Gleiberman found it more similar to an anecdote than to a regular narrative.

==Reception==
&quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; found &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; &quot;Quietly powerful and thoroughly credible&quot;. L.S. Klepp of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; &quot;a short, poignant story, moving precisely because it has the ragged edges of reality&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the novella&#x27;s &quot;compelling&quot; story for &quot;elevating to a spiritual level the common fantasy, in which a virile stranger materializes in the kitchen of a quiet housewife and takes her into his arms.&quot;
The book debuted on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list in August 1992 and slowly climbed to number 1, and remained on the list for over three years (164 consecutive weeks), through October 8, 1995.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; was made into a 1995 film of the same name, adapted by Richard LaGravenese and directed by Clint Eastwood. It stars Eastwood and Meryl Streep.

==Musical adaptation==

&quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; was adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical with music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown and the book by Marsha Norman, premiering at the 2013 Williamstown Theatre Festival. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the cast featured Elena Shaddow as Francesca and Steven Pasquale. The musical began previews on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on January 17, 2014 and officially opened on February 20, 2014 with Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Francesca and Steven Pasquale as Robert Kincaid. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the sets are by Michael Yeargan, costumes by Catherine Zuber, and lighting by Donald Holder. Hunter Foster played the role of Bud Johnson, the husband of Francesca. It closed in May of the same year after 100 performances.

==Theatre==
In 2018, the Argentine theatrical director Luis &quot;Indio&quot; Romero directed the actors Facundo Arana and Araceli González in a Spanish version of the work.

<doc id="781891" wikidata="Q2664539" url="?curid=781891" title="Philosophical zombie">
<text>A philosophical zombie (or &quot;p-zombie&quot;) is a being in a thought experiment in the philosophy of mind that is physically identical to a normal human being but does not have conscious experience.

For example, if a philosophical zombie were poked with a sharp object, it would not feel any pain, but it would react exactly the way any conscious human would. Philosophical zombie arguments are used against forms of physicalism and in defense of the hard problem of consciousness, which is the problem of accounting in physical terms for subjective, intrinsic, first-person, what-it&#x27;s-like-ness experiences. Proponents of philosophical zombie arguments, such as the philosopher David Chalmers, argue that since a philosophical zombie is by definition physically identical to a conscious person, even its logical possibility refutes physicalism. This is because it establishes the existence of conscious experience as a further fact. Philosopher Daniel Stoljar points out that zombies need not be utterly without subjective states, and that even a subtle psychological difference between two physically identical people, such as how coffee tastes to them, is enough to refute physicalism. Such arguments have been criticized by many philosophers. Some physicalists, such as Daniel Dennett, argue that philosophical zombies are logically incoherent and thus impossible, or that all humans are philosophical zombies; others, such as Christopher Hill, argue that philosophical zombies are coherent but metaphysically impossible.

==History==
Philosophical zombies are associated with David Chalmers, but it was philosopher Robert Kirk who first used the term &quot;zombie&quot; in this context, in 1974. Before that, Keith Campbell made a similar argument in his 1970 book &quot;Body and Mind&quot;, using the term &quot;imitation man&quot;. Chalmers further developed and popularized the idea in his work.

There has been a lively debate about what exactly what the argument demonstrates. Critics who primarily argue that zombies are not conceivable include Daniel Dennett, Nigel J. T. Thomas, David Braddon-Mitchell, and Robert Kirk. Critics who assert mostly that conceivability does not entail possibility include Katalin Balog, Keith Frankish, Christopher Hill, and Stephen Yablo. Critics who question the argument&#x27;s logical validity include George Bealer.

In his 2019 update to the article on philosophical zombies in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, Kirk summed up the current state of the debate:
A 2013 survey of professional philosophers by Bourget and Chalmers found that 36% said p-zombies were conceivable but metaphysically impossible; 23% said they were metaphysically possible; 16% said they were inconceivable; and 25% responded &quot;other&quot;. In 2020, the same survey yielded almost identical results: &quot;conceivable but impossible&quot; 37%, &quot;metaphysically possible&quot; 24%, &quot;inconceivable&quot; 16%, and &quot;other&quot; 23%.

==Types of zombies==
Though philosophical zombies are widely used in thought experiments, the detailed articulation of the concept is not always the same. P-zombies were introduced primarily to argue against specific types of physicalism such as materialism and behaviorism, according to which mental states exist solely as behavior. Belief, desire, thought, consciousness, and so on, are conceptualized as behavior (whether external behavior or internal behavior) or tendencies towards behaviors. A p-zombie behaviorally indistinguishable from a normal human being but lacking conscious experiences is therefore not logically possible according to the behaviorist, so an appeal to the logical possibility of a p-zombie furnishes an argument that behaviorism is false. Proponents of zombie arguments generally accept that p-zombies are not physically possible, while opponents necessarily deny that they are metaphysically or, in some cases, even logically possible.

The unifying idea of the zombie is that of a human completely lacking conscious experience. It is possible to distinguish various zombie subtypes used in different thought experiments as follows:

* A behavioral zombie is behaviorally indistinguishable from a human.
* A neurological zombie has a human brain and is generally physiologically indistinguishable from a human.
* A soulless zombie lacks a soul.
* An imperfect zombie or imp-zombie is like a p-zombie but behaves differently than a human. It is important in the context of the mind-evolution problem.
* A zombie universe is identical to our world in all physical ways, except no being in it has qualia.

==Zombie arguments==
Zombie arguments often support lines of reasoning that aim to show that zombies are metaphysically possible in order to support some form of dualism—in this case the view that the world includes two kinds of substance (or perhaps two kinds of property): the mental and the physical.

In physicalism, material facts determine all other facts. Since any fact other than that of consciousness may be held to be the same for a p-zombie and for a normal conscious human, it follows that physicalism must hold that p-zombies are either not possible or are the same as normal humans.

The zombie argument is a version of general modal arguments against physicalism, such as that of Saul Kripke. Further such arguments were notably advanced in the 1970s by Thomas Nagel (1970; 1974) and Robert Kirk (1974), but the general argument was most famously developed in detail by David Chalmers in &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; (1996).

According to Chalmers, one can coherently conceive of an entire zombie world, a world physically indistinguishable from this one but entirely lacking conscious experience. Since such a world is conceivable, Chalmers claims, it is metaphysically possible, which is all the argument requires. Chalmers writes: &quot;Zombies are probably not naturally possible: they probably cannot exist in our world, with its laws of nature.&quot; The outline structure of Chalmers&#x27;s version of the zombie argument is as follows:

#According to physicalism, all that exists in our world (including consciousness) is physical. 
#Thus, if physicalism is true, a metaphysically possible world in which all physical facts are the same as those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world. In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a possible world.
#Chalmers argues that we can conceive of a world physically indistinguishable from our world but in which there is no consciousness (a zombie world). From this it follows that such a world is metaphysically possible.
#Therefore, physicalism is false. (The conclusion follows from 2. and 3. by &quot;modus tollens&quot;.)

The above is a strong formulation of the zombie argument. There are other formulations of zombie-type arguments that follow the same general form. The premises of the general zombie argument are implied by the premises of all the specific zombie arguments.

A general zombie argument is in part motivated by potential disagreements between various anti-physicalist views. For example, an anti-physicalist view can consistently assert that p-zombies are metaphysically impossible but that inverted qualia (such as inverted spectra) or absent qualia (partial zombiehood) are metaphysically possible. Premises regarding inverted qualia or partial zombiehood can replace premises regarding p-zombies to produce variations of the zombie argument.

The metaphysical possibility of a physically indistinguishable world with either inverted qualia or partial zombiehood implies that physical truths do not metaphysically necessitate phenomenal truths.

To construct the general form of the zombie argument, take the sentence P to be true if and only if the conjunct of all microphysical truths of our world obtain, and take the sentence Q to be true if some phenomenal truth that obtains in the actual world obtains. The general argument goes as follows.

#It is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true.
#If it is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true then it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q not true.
#If it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q is not true then physicalism is false.
#Therefore, physicalism is false.

Q can be false in a possible world if any of the following obtains: (1) there exists at least one invert relative to the actual world; (2) there is at least one absent quale relative to the actual world; (3) all actually conscious beings are p-zombies (all actual qualia are absent qualia).

Another way to construe the zombie hypothesis is epistemically—as a problem of causal explanation, rather than as a problem of logical or metaphysical possibility. The &quot;explanatory gap&quot;—also called the &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot;—is the claim that (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are conscious. It is a manifestation of the very same gap that (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are not zombies.

The philosophical zombie argument can also be seen through the counterfeit bill example brought forth by Amy Kind. Kind&#x27;s example centers around a counterfeit 20-dollar bill made to be exactly like an authentic 20-dollar bill. This is logically possible. Yet the counterfeit bill would not have the same value.

According to Kind, in her book &quot;Philosophy of Mind: The Basics&quot;, The Zombie Argument can be put in this standard form from a dualist point of view:

==Responses==
Galen Strawson argues that it is not possible to establish the conceivability of zombies, so the argument, lacking its first premise, can never get going.

Chalmers has argued that zombies are conceivable, saying, &quot;it certainly seems that a coherent situation is described; I can discern no contradiction in the description.&quot;

Many physicalist philosophers have argued that this scenario eliminates itself by its description; the basis of a physicalist argument is that the world is defined entirely by physicality; thus, a world that was physically identical would necessarily contain consciousness, as consciousness would necessarily be generated from any set of physical circumstances identical to our own.

The zombie argument claims that one can tell by the power of reason that such a &quot;zombie scenario&quot; is metaphysically possible. Chalmers writes, &quot;From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility&quot; and argues that this inference, while not generally legitimate, is legitimate for phenomenal concepts such as consciousness since we must adhere to &quot;Kripke&#x27;s insight that for phenomenal concepts, there is no gap between reference-fixers and reference (or between primary and secondary intentions).&quot;

That is, for phenomenal concepts, conceivability implies possibility. According to Chalmers, whatever is logically possible is also, in the sense relevant here, metaphysically possible.

Another response is the denial of the idea that qualia and related phenomenal notions of the mind are in the first place coherent concepts. Daniel Dennett and others argue that while consciousness and subjective experience exist in some sense, they are not as the zombie argument proponent claims. The experience of pain, for example, is not something that can be stripped off a person&#x27;s mental life without bringing about any behavioral or physiological differences. Dennett believes that consciousness is a complex series of functions and ideas. If we all can have these experiences the idea of the p-zombie is meaningless.

Dennett argues that &quot;when philosophers claim that zombies are conceivable, they invariably underestimate the task of conception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that violates their own definition&quot;. He coined the term &quot;zimboes&quot;—p-zombies that have second-order beliefs—to argue that the idea of a p-zombie is incoherent; &quot;Zimboes thinkZ they are conscious, thinkZ they have qualia, thinkZ they suffer pains—they are just &#x27;wrong&#x27; (according to this lamentable tradition), in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!&quot;.

Michael Lynch agrees with Dennett, arguing that the zombie conceivability argument forces us to either question whether we actually have consciousness or accept that zombies are not possible. If zombies falsely believe they are conscious, how can we be sure we are not zombies? We may believe we are experiencing conscious mental states when in fact we merely hold a false belief. Lynch thinks denying the possibility of zombies is more reasonable than questioning our own consciousness.

Furthermore, when the concept of self is deemed to correspond to physical reality alone (reductive physicalism), philosophical zombies are denied by definition. When a distinction is made in one&#x27;s mind between a hypothetical zombie and oneself (assumed not to be a zombie), the hypothetical zombie, being a subset of the concept of oneself, must entail a deficit in observables (cognitive systems), a &quot;seductive error&quot; contradicting the original definition of a zombie.

Thomas Metzinger dismisses the zombie argument as no longer relevant to the consciousness community, calling it a weak argument that covertly relies on the difficulty in defining &quot;consciousness&quot; and an &quot;ill-defined folk psychological umbrella term&quot;.

According to verificationism, for words to have meaning, their use must be open to public verification. Since it is assumed that we can talk about our qualia, the existence of zombies is impossible.

Artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky saw the argument as circular. The proposition of the possibility of something physically identical to a human but without subjective experience assumes that the physical characteristics of humans are not what produces those experiences, which is exactly what the argument claims to prove.

Richard Brown agrees that the zombie argument is circular. To show this, he proposes &quot;&quot;, which are creatures &quot;non&quot;physically identical to people in every way and lacking phenomenal consciousness. If existed, they would refute dualism because they would show that consciousness is indeed physical. Paralleling the argument from Chalmers: It is conceivable that exist, so it is possible they exist, so dualism is false. Given the symmetry between the zombie and arguments, we cannot arbitrate the physicalism/dualism question &quot;a priori&quot;.

Similarly, Gualtiero Piccinini argues that the zombie conceivability argument is circular. Piccinini questions whether the possible worlds where zombies exist are accessible from our world. If physicalism is true in our world, then physicalism is one of the relevant facts about our world for determining whether a possible zombie world is accessible from our world. Therefore, asking whether zombies are metaphysically possible in our world is equivalent to asking whether physicalism is true in our world.

Stephen Yablo&#x27;s (1998) response is to provide an error theory to account for the intuition that zombies are possible. Notions of what counts as physical and as physically possible change over time so conceptual analysis is not reliable here. Yablo says he is &quot;braced for the information that is going to make zombies inconceivable, even though I have no real idea what form the information is going to take.&quot;

The zombie argument is difficult to assess because it brings to light fundamental disagreements about the method and scope of philosophy itself and the nature and abilities of conceptual analysis. Proponents of the zombie argument may think that conceptual analysis is a central part of (if not the only part of) philosophy and that it certainly can do a great deal of philosophical work. But others, such as Dennett, Paul Churchland and W.V.O. Quine, have fundamentally different views. For this reason, discussion of the zombie argument remains vigorous in philosophy.

Some accept modal reasoning in general but deny it in the zombie case. Christopher S. Hill and Brian P. McLaughlin suggest that the zombie thought experiment combines imagination of a &quot;sympathetic&quot; nature (putting oneself in a phenomenal state) and a &quot;perceptual&quot; nature (imagining becoming aware of something in the outside world). Each type of imagination may work on its own but not work when used at the same time. Hence Chalmers&#x27;s argument need not go through.

Moreover, while Chalmers defuses criticisms of the view that conceivability can tell us about possibility, he provides no positive defense of the principle. As an analogy, the generalized continuum hypothesis has no known counterexamples, but this does not mean we must accept it. Indeed, according to Hill and McLaughlin, the fact that Chalmers concludes we have epiphenomenal mental states that do not cause our physical behavior seems to be a reason to reject his principle.

Frank Jackson&#x27;s knowledge argument is based around a hypothetical scientist, Mary, who is forced to view the world through a black-and-white television screen in a black and white room. Mary is a brilliant scientist who knows everything about the neurobiology of vision. Even though she knows everything about color and its perception (e.g. what combination of wavelengths makes the sky seem blue), she has never seen color. If Mary were released from this room and experienced color for the first time, would she learn anything new? Jackson initially believed this supported epiphenomenalism (mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena) but later changed his view to physicalism, suggesting that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.

Swampman is an imaginary character introduced by Donald Davidson. If Davidson goes hiking in a swamp and is struck and killed by a lightning bolt while nearby another lightning bolt spontaneously rearranges a bunch of molecules so that, entirely by coincidence, they take on exactly the same form that Davidson&#x27;s body had at the moment of his untimely death, then this being, &quot;Swampman&quot;, has a brain structurally identical to Davidson&#x27;s and will thus presumably behave exactly like Davidson. He will return to Davidson&#x27;s office and write the same essays he would have written, recognize all of his friends and family, and so forth.

John Searle&#x27;s Chinese room argument deals with the nature of artificial intelligence: it imagines a room in which a conversation is held by means of written Chinese characters that the subject cannot actually read, but is able to manipulate meaningfully using a set of algorithms. Searle holds that a program cannot give a computer a &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot;, regardless of how intelligently it may make it behave. Stevan Harnad argues that Searle&#x27;s critique is really meant to target functionalism and computationalism, and to establish neuroscience as the only correct way to understand the mind.

Physicist Adam Brown has suggested constructing a type of philosophical zombie using counterfactual quantum computation, a technique in which a computer is placed into a superposition of running and not running. If the program being executed is a brain simulation, and if one makes the further assumption that brain simulations are conscious, then the simulation can have the same output as a conscious system, yet not be conscious.

<text>Brenda Blethyn ( Bottle; born 20 February 1946) is an English actress. Known for her character work and versatility, she is the recipient of various accolades, including a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and a Cannes Film Festival Award, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards and two Primetime Emmys. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama in 2003.

Blethyn pursued an administrative career before enrolling at the Guildford School of Acting in her late 20s. She subsequently joined the Royal National Theatre, gaining attention for her performances in plays such as &quot;Benefactors&quot; (1984), for which she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a New Play. She made her Broadway debut in the revival of the Marsha Norman play &quot;&#x27;Night Mother&quot; (2004). 

She made her feature film debut with a small part in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990). She starred in the Mike Leigh film &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; (1996), which earned her a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was also Oscar-nominated for her role in &quot;Little Voice&quot; (1998). Her other notable film credits include &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992), &quot;Girls&#x27; Night&quot; (1998), &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2000), &quot;Lovely &amp; Amazing&quot; (2001), &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (2002), &quot;A Way of Life&quot; (2004), &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), and &quot;Atonement&quot; (2007).

Blethyn made her screen debut in the Mike Leigh television film &quot;Grown-Ups&quot; (1980). She has since starred in the sitcoms &quot;Chance in a Million&quot; (1984–1986), &quot;The Labours of Erica&quot; (1989–1990), &quot;Outside Edge&quot; (1994–1996), and &quot;Kate &amp; Koji&quot; (2020–2022). She received Primetime Emmy Award nominations playing Auguste van Pels in &quot;Anne Frank: The Whole Story&quot; (2001) and for her guest role in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2008). From 2011 to 2025 she starred in ITV crime drama series &quot;Vera&quot; portraying Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope.

==Early life and education==
Born in Ramsgate, Kent, Blethyn was the youngest of nine children in a Roman Catholic, working-class family. Her mother, Louisa Kathleen (née Supple; 10 May 1904 – 21 June 1992), was a housewife and former maid who had met Blethyn&#x27;s father, William Charles Bottle (5 March 1894 – 9 January 1985) in approximately 1922 while working for the same household in Broadstairs, Kent. Bottle had previously worked as a shepherd, and spent six years in British India with the Royal Field Artillery immediately prior to returning home to Broadstairs to become the family&#x27;s chauffeur. Before WWII, he found work as a mechanic at the Vauxhall car factory in Luton, Bedfordshire.

The family lived in poor circumstances at their maternal grandmother&#x27;s home. In 1944, after an engagement of 20 years and the births of eight children, the couple wed and moved into a small rented house in Ramsgate. By the time Blethyn was born in 1946, her three eldest siblings—Pam, Ted, and Bernard—had already left home. Her parents introduced Blethyn to film, taking her to the cinema weekly.

Blethyn trained at technical college and worked as a stenographer and bookkeeper for a bank as a young adult. Towards the end of her first marriage, she opted to turn her hobby of amateur dramatics to her professional advantage. After studying at the Guildford School of Acting, she went onto the London stage in 1976, performing several seasons at the Royal National Theatre. In the following three years, she participated in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot;, &quot;The Fruits of Enlightenment&quot; opposite Sir Ralph Richardson, &quot;Bedroom Farce&quot;, &quot;The Passion&quot;, and &quot;Strife&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1995: Early work and sitcom roles ===
After winning the London Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Award for Best Supporting Actress (for &quot;Steaming&quot;) in 1980, Blethyn made her screen debut, starring in the play &quot;Grown Ups&quot; as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Playhouse&quot; strand. Directed by Mike Leigh, their first collaboration marked the start of a professional relationship which would later earn both of them huge acclaim. Blethyn followed this with roles in Shakespearean adaptations for the BBC, playing Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot; and Joan of Arc in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. She also appeared with Robert Bathurst and others in the popular BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Dial M For Pizza&quot;. In the following years, Blethyn expanded her status as a professional stage actress, appearing in productions including &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Dalliance&quot;, &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot; and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. She was nominated for an Olivier Award for her performance as Sheila in &quot;Benefactors&quot;. Meanwhile, she continued with roles on British television, playing opposite Simon Callow as Tom Chance&#x27;s frustrated fiancée Alison Little in three series of the sitcom &quot;Chance in a Million&quot;. She also had roles in comedies such as &quot;Yes Minister&quot; (1981), &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; and a variety of roles in the BBC Radio 4 comedy &quot;Delve Special&quot; alongside Stephen Fry and a role in the school comedy/drama &quot;King Street Junior&quot;.

In 1989, she starred in &quot;The Labours of Erica&quot;, a sitcom written for her by &quot;Chance in a Million&quot; writers Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss. Blethyn played Erica Parsons, a single mother approaching her fortieth birthday who realises that life is passing her by. Finding her teenage diary and discovering a list of twelve tasks and ambitions which she had set for herself, Erica sets out to complete them before reaching the milestone. After 15 years of working in theatre and television, Blethyn made her big screen debut with a small role in 1990s dark fantasy film &quot;The Witches&quot;. The film, based on the same-titled book by Roald Dahl, co-starred actresses Anjelica Huston and Jane Horrocks. &quot;Witches&quot; received generally positive reviews, as did Blethyn, whom Craig Butler of All Media Guide considered as a &quot;valuable support&quot; for her performance of the mother, Mrs Jenkins.

In 1991, after starring in a play in New York City, Blethyn was recommended to Robert Redford to audition for the soft-spoken mother role in his next project &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992). A period drama based on the same-titled 1976 novel by Norman Maclean, also starring Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt, the film revolves around two sons of a Presbyterian minister—one studious and the other rebellious—as they grow up and come of age during the Prohibition era in the United States. Portraying a second generation immigrant of Scottish heritage, Redford required Blethyn to adopt a Western American accent for her performance, prompting her to live in Livingston, Montana, in preparation of her role. Upon its release, the film, budgeted at US$19 million, became a financial and critical success, resulting in a US box office total of US$43.3 million.

Simultaneously Blethyn continued working on stage and in British television. Between 1990 and 1996, she starred in five different plays, including &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; and &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company and her American stage debut &quot;Absent Friends&quot;, for which eventually received a Theatre World Award for Outstanding New Talent. She played character parts in the BBC adaptation of Hanif Kureishi&#x27;s &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; and the ITV cricketing comedy-drama series &quot;Outside Edge&quot;, based on the play by television writer Richard Harris. Blethyn also performed in a variety of episodes of &quot;Alas Smith &amp; Jones&quot; and &quot;Maigret&quot;.

=== 1996–2003: Film breakthrough and acclaim === 
Blethyn&#x27;s breakthrough came with Mike Leigh&#x27;s 1996 drama &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;. Starring alongside Marianne Jean-Baptiste, she portrayed a lower-class box factory worker, who after years once again comes in contact with her illegitimate grown-up black daughter, whom she gave up for adoption 30 years earlier. For her improvised performance, Blethyn was praised with a variety of awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Upon its success, Blethyn later stated: &quot;I knew it was a great film, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to get the attention it did because none of his other films had and I thought they were just as good. Of course, I didn&#x27;t know what it was about until I saw it in the cinema because of the way that he works—but I knew it was good. That it reached a wider audience surprised me.&quot; Besides critical acclaim &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; also became a financial success; budgeted at an estimated $4.5 million, the film grossed an unexpected $13.5 million in its limited theatrical run in North America.

The following year, Blethyn appeared in a supporting role in Nick Hurran&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Remember Me?&quot; (1997), a middle class suburban farce revolving around a family whose life is thrown into chaos upon the arrival of an old university crush. Forging another collaboration with the director, the actress was cast alongside Julie Walters for Hurran&#x27;s next project, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Girls&#x27; Night&quot;, a drama film about two sisters-in-law, one dying of cancer, who fulfil a lifelong dream of going to Las Vegas, Nevada, after an unexpected jackpot win on the bingo. Loosely based upon the real experiences by writer Kay Mellor, the production was originally destined for television until Granada Productions found backing from Showtime. Premiered to a mixed response by critics at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, who noted it a &quot;rather formulaic tearjerker [with] two powerhouse Brit actresses,&quot; Hurran won a Silver Spire at the San Francisco International Film Festival and received a Golden Berlin Bear nomination at the Berlin International Film Festival for his work. In John Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Night Train&quot; (1998), Blethyn played a timid spinster who strikes up a friendship with John Hurt&#x27;s character, an ex-prisoner, who rents a room in her house while on the run from some nasty gangsters. A romantic drama with comedic and thrilling elements, the film was shot at several locations in Ireland, England and Italy in 1997, and received a limited release the following year. The film received a mixed reception from critics. Adrian Wootton of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;an impressive directorial debut [that] mainly succeeds because [of] the talents of its lead actors&quot;. The film was nominated for a Crystal Star at the Brussels International Film Festival. She also starred in James Bogle&#x27;s film adaption of Tim Winton&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;In the Winter Dark&quot; (1998).

Blethyn&#x27;s last film of 1998 was &quot;Little Voice&quot; opposite Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine. Cast against type, she played a domineering yet needy fish factory worker, who has nothing but contempt for her shy daughter and lusts after a local showbiz agent. A breakaway from the kind at heart roles Blethyn had previously played, it was the character&#x27;s antipathy that attracted the actress to accept the role of Mari: &quot;I have to understand why she is the way she is. She is a desperate woman, but she also has an optimistic take on life which I find enviable. Whilst I don&#x27;t approve of her behaviour, there is a reason for it and it was my job to work that out.&quot; Both Blethyn&#x27;s performance and the film received rave reviews, and the following year, she was again Oscar nominated, this time for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Blethyn&#x27;s first film of 2000 was the indie comedy &quot;Saving Grace&quot; with Craig Ferguson. Blethyn played a middle-aged newly widowed woman who is faced with the prospect of financial ruin and turns to growing marijuana under the tutelage of her gardener to save her home. Her performance in the film received favourable reviews; Peter Travers wrote for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s Blethyn&#x27;s solid-gold charm [that] turns &quot;Saving Grace&quot; into a comic high.&quot; The following year, Blethyn received her third Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film, which grossed an unexpected $24 million worldwide. That same year, she also had a smaller role in the short comedy &quot;Yes You Can&quot;.

In 2001, Blethyn signed on to star in her own CBS sitcom, &quot;The Seven Roses&quot;, in which she was to play the role of a widowed innkeeper and matriarch of an eccentric family. Originally slated to be produced by two former executive producers of &quot;Frasier&quot;, plans for a pilot eventually went nowhere due to early casting conflicts. Afterwards, Blethyn accepted a supporting role as Auguste van Pels in the ABC mini series &quot;Anne Frank: The Whole Story&quot; based on the book by Melissa Müller, for which she garnered her first Emmy Award nomination. Following this, Blethyn starred in the films &quot;Daddy and Them&quot;, &quot;On the Nose&quot;, and &quot;Lovely &amp; Amazing&quot;. In Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Daddy and Them&quot;, she portrayed an English neurotic psychologist, who feels excluded by the American clan she married into due to her nationality. The film scored a generally positive reception but was financially unsuccessful, leading to a direct-to-TV release stateside. In Canadian-Irish comedy &quot;On the Nose&quot;, Blethyn played the minor role of the all-disapproving wife of Brendan Delaney, played by Robbie Coltrane. Her appearance was commented as &quot;underused&quot; by Harry Guerin, writer for &quot;RTÉ Entertainment&quot;. Blethyn depicted an affluent but desperate and distracted matriarch of three daughters in Nicole Holofcener&#x27;s independent drama &quot;Lovely &amp; Amazing&quot;, featuring Catherine Keener, Emily Mortimer and Jake Gyllenhaal. The film became Blethyn&#x27;s biggest box-office success of the year with a worldwide gross of $5 million only, and earned the actress mixed reviews from professional critics. She also did the UK voice of Dr. Florence Mountfitchet in the Bob the Builder special, &quot;The Knights of Can-A-Lot&quot;.

In 2002, Blethyn appeared with Christina Ricci in the dark comedy &quot;Pumpkin&quot;, a financial disaster. The film opened to little notice and grossed less than $300,000 during its North American theatrical run. Her performance as the overprotective wine-soaked mother of a disabled teenage boy generated Blethyn mostly critical reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Lisa Schwarzbaum called her &quot;challenged, unsure [... and] miscast.&quot; Her following film, limitedly-released Nicolas Cage&#x27;s &quot;Sonny&quot;, saw similar success. While the production was panned in general, the actress earned mixed reviews for her performance of an eccentric ex-prostitute and mother, as some critics such as Kevin Thomas considered her casting as &quot;problematic [due to] caricatured acting.&quot; Blethyn eventually received more acclaim when she accepted the lead role in the dark comedy &quot;Plots with a View&quot;. Starring alongside Alfred Molina, the pair was praised for their &quot;genuine chemistry.&quot; A year after, Blethyn co-starred with Bob Hoskins and Jessica Alba in historical direct-to-video drama &quot;The Sleeping Dictionary&quot;. The film earned her a DVDX Award but received mixed critics, as did &quot;Blizzard&quot;, a Christmas movie in which Blethyn played the eccentric character of Aunt Millie, the narrator of the film&#x27;s story. 2003 ended with the mini series &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;, in which Blethyn starred as a woman struggling with her own ambivalent feelings towards her husband and sex.

===2004–2010: Established actress ===

Blethyn co-starred as Bobby Darin&#x27;s mother Polly Cassotto in &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, a 2004 biographical film about the singer. The film was a financial disappointment: budgeted at an estimated US$25 million, it opened to little notice and grossed only $6 million in its North American theatrical run. Margaret Pomeranz of &quot;At the Movies&quot; said that her casting was &quot;a bit mystifying&quot;. Afterwards, Blethyn starred in &quot;A Way of Life&quot;, playing a bossy and censorious mother-in-law of a struggling young woman, played by Stephanie James, and in the television film &quot;Belonging&quot;, starring as a middle-aged childless woman who is left to look after the elderly relatives of her husband and to make a new life for herself after he leaves her for a younger woman. Blethyn received a Golden FIPA Award and a BAFTA nomination for the latter role. That same year she made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;&#x27;Night Mother&quot; opposite Edie Falco. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that while &quot;she has the requisite fretful voice and fidgety mannerisms down pat, it&#x27;s as if she is doing a technically perfect impersonation in a vacuum.&quot;

In early 2005, Blethyn appeared in the indie-drama &quot;On a Clear Day&quot; playing Joan, a Glasgow housewife, who secretly enrolls in bus-driving classes after her husband&#x27;s dismissal. Her performance in the film received positive reviews; ABC writer MaryAnn Johanson wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s Blethyn, who wraps the movie in a cosy, comfortable, maternal hug that reassures you that it will weather its risk-taking with aplomb [...].&quot; The film became a minor success at the international box-office chart, barely grossing $1 million worldwide, but was awarded a BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Film and Screenplay.

A major hit for Blethyn came with Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;, a 2005 adaptation of the same-titled novel by Jane Austen. Starring alongside Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, Blethyn played Mrs. Bennet, a fluttery mother of five sisters who desperately schemes to marry her daughters off to men of means. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought she had a real problem and shouldn&#x27;t be made fun of. She&#x27;s pushy with a reason. As soon as Mr. Bennet dies, all the money goes down the male line; she has to save her daughters from penury.&quot; With both a worldwide gross of over US$121 million and several Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, the film became a critical and commercial success, spawning Blethyn another BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 2007, she appeared in the independent Australian coming-of-age comedy &quot;Clubland&quot;. Playing a character that was created specifically with her in mind, Blethyn portrayed a bawdy comedian with a sinking career faced with the romantic life of her young son, played by Khan Chittenden. The film was released in Australia in June 2007, and was screened Sundance Film Festival where distributed Warner Independent Pictures for a $4 million deal and gained positive reviews. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Carina Chocano wrote, &quot;the movie belongs to Blethyn, who takes a difficult, easily misunderstood role and gracefully cracks it open to reveal what&#x27;s inside.&quot; The role earned her nominations for the Australian Film Institute Award and an Inside Film Award.

Also in 2007, Blethyn reunited with Joe Wright on &quot;Atonement&quot;, an adaptation from Ian McEwan&#x27;s critically acclaimed novel of the same name. On her role of a housekeeper in a cast that also features Keira Knightley, Saoirse Ronan and James McAvoy, Blethyn commented: &quot;It&#x27;s a tiny, tiny part. If you blink you&#x27;ll miss me.&quot; The film garnered generally positive reviews from film critics and received a Best Picture nomination at the 2008 Academy Awards. A box office success around the globe, it went on to gross a total of $129 million worldwide. Blethyn also appeared as Márja Dmitrijewna Achrosímowa in a supporting role in the internationally produced 2007 miniseries &quot;War and Peace&quot; by RAI, filmed in Russia and Lithuania.

In 2008, Blethyn made her American small screen debut with a guest role on CBS sitcom &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;, playing the neurotic mother to Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27; character in the fourth season episode &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Not Coming to Dinner.&quot; The same year, she appeared in a single season ten episode of the NBC legal drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Her performance of a sympathetic fugitive of domestic violence and rape that killed her first husband in self-defense earned Blethyn another Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Drama Series nomination. Blethyn again provided the voice of Mama Heffalump in the animated Disney direct-to-video animated sequel &quot;Tigger &amp; Pooh and a Musical Too&quot; (2009).

Blethyn&#x27;s first film in two years, Rachid Bouchareb&#x27;s &quot;London River&quot; opened at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival in 2009 where it won a Special Mention by the Ecumenical Jury. In the film, for which Blethyn had to learn French, she portrays a mother waiting for news of her missing child after the London bombings of July 2005, striking up a friendship with a Muslim man, whose child has also disappeared. Blethyn, who had initially felt sceptical and reticent about the film due to its background, was originally not available for filming but Bouchareb decided to delay filming to work with her. Upon release, the film received favourable reviews, particularly for its &quot;dynamite acting&quot;. Mike Scott from &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; commented &quot;that Blethyn&#x27;s performance is nuanced [...] it&#x27;s that performance—at turns sweet, funny and heartbreaking—that ultimately draws viewers in and defies them to stop watching&quot;.

Also in 2009, Blethyn played a Benedictine nun in Jan Dunn&#x27;s film &quot;The Calling&quot;, also starring Joanna Scanlan and Pauline McLynn. Dunn&#x27;s third feature film, it tells the story of Joanna, played by Emily Beecham, who after graduating from university, goes against her family and friends when she decides to join a closed order of nuns. Released to film festivals in 2009, the independent drama was not released to UK cinemas until 2010, when it was met with mixed to negative reviews by critics, some of which declared it &quot;half &quot;Doubt&quot;, half &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;&quot;. Blethyn however, earned positive reviews for her performance; &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Catherine Shoard wrote that &quot;only she, really, manages to ride the rollercoaster jumps in plot and tone.&quot; Her last film of 2009 was Alex De Rakoff&#x27;s crime film &quot;Dead Man Running&quot; alongside Tamer Hassan, Danny Dyer, and 50 Cent, in which she portrayed the wheelchair-using mother of a criminal who is taken hostage. The film received universally negative reviews from film critics, who deemed it to be full of &quot;poor performances, stiff dialogue, [and] flat characters&quot;.

===2011–present: &quot;Vera&quot; and other roles ===
In May 2011, Blethyn began playing the title role in ITV&#x27;s crime drama series, &quot;Vera&quot; as the North of England character Vera Stanhope, a nearly retired detective chief inspector obsessive about her work and driven by her own demons, based on the novels of Ann Cleeves. Initially broadcast to mixed reviews, it has since received favourable reviews, with Chitra Ramaswamy from &quot;The Guardian&quot; writing in 2016: &quot;Blethyn is the best thing about &quot;Vera&quot; [...] She has the loveliest voice, at once girlish and gruff. Her face is kind but means business. Not many actors can pull off shambolic but effective but Blethyn can do it with a single, penetrating glance from beneath that hat.&quot; Averaging 7.8 million people per episode in the United Kingdom, &quot;Vera&quot; became one of the most watched British dramas of the 2010s. Blethyn received the 2017 RTS North East &amp; Border Television Award for her performance and has continued to portray Vera in 14 series of the show, available in 20 countries. Blethyn&#x27;s only film of 2011 was the Christmas drama &quot;My Angel&quot; about a boy looking for an angel to save his mother after an accident. Shot in Northwood for less than £2 million, &quot;My Angel&quot; scooped best film, newcomer, director and screenplay, plus best actor and actress for Blethyn and Spall at the Monaco International Film Festival. In 2012 Blethyn starred opposite singer Tom Jones and actress Alison Steadman in the short film &quot;King of the Teds&quot;, directed by Jim Cartwright, as part of Sky Arts &quot;Playhouse Presents&quot; series. She played an old flame who gets in touch with a former boyfriend by Facebook, introducing tensions and doubts from 40 years before.

In March 2013, Blethyn costarred with Hilary Swank in the BBC movie &quot;Mary and Martha&quot;. Based on a screenplay by Richard Curtis and directed by Phillip Noyce, it involves two very different women who both lose their sons to malaria. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with Linda Stasi from &quot;The New York Post&quot; writing that &quot;while Swank and Blethyn make everything they&#x27;re in more remarkable for their presence, the movie plays more like a based-on-fact Lifetime flick than an HBO work of fiction.&quot; Also in 2013, Blethyn began voicing the supporting character of Ernestine Enormomonster in two seasons of the children&#x27;s animated television series &quot;Henry Hugglemonster&quot;, based on the 2005 book &quot;I&#x27;m a Happy Hugglewug&quot; by Niamh Sharkey.

In 2014, Blethyn reteamed with filmmaker Rachid Bouchareb for the French–American drama film &quot;Two Men in Town&quot; (2014), a remake of the 1973 film. Along with Forest Whitaker and Harvey Keitel, Blethyn portrays a parole officer in the Western film shot in New Mexico. Whilst critical reception towards the film as a whole was lukewarm, Sherilyn Connelly from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; remarked that Blethyn &quot;is wonderful as an all-too-rare character, a middle-aged woman who holds her own in a position of authority over violent men.&quot; In January 2015, Blethyn was presented the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 19th Capri Hollywood International Film Festival. 

In 2016, Blethyn lent her voice to the British animated biographical film &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot;, based on the graphic memoir of the same name that follows Raymond Briggs&#x27; parents through their marriage, from the 1920s to their deaths in the 1970s. The film earned favorable reviews from critics, who called it &quot;gentle, poignant, and vividly animated&quot; as well as &quot;a warm character study with an evocative sense of time and place.&quot; Blethyn received a nomination in the Best Voice Performance category at the British Animation Awards 2018. From 2020 to 2022, she played Kate Abbott, the cafe-owner in &quot;Kate and Koji&quot; who developed strong friendships with two asylum-seeking doctors: Jimmy Akingbola in Series 1 and Okorie Chukwu in Series 2.

== Personal life ==
Blethyn married Alan James Blethyn, a graphic designer she met while working for British Rail, in 1964. The marriage ended in 1973.
Blethyn kept her husband&#x27;s surname as her professional name. British art director Michael Mayhew has been her partner since 1975, and the couple married in June 2010. 

Blethyn was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama in the 2003 New Year Honours.

<doc id="781908" wikidata="Q33554" url="?curid=781908" title="Lanner falcon">
<text>The lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus) is a medium-sized bird of prey that breeds in Africa, southeast Europe and just into Asia. It prefers open habitat and is mainly resident, but some birds disperse more widely after the breeding season. A large falcon, it preys on birds and bats. Most likely either the lanner or peregrine falcon was the sacred species of falcon to the ancient Egyptians, and some ancient Egyptian deities, like Ra and Horus, were often represented as a man with the head of a lanner falcon.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The lanner falcon was described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1825 under the current binomial name &quot;Falco biarmicus&quot;. The type locality is Caffraria and the Cape of Good Hope. &quot;Falco&quot; is Late Latin for a &quot;falcon&quot;, from &quot;falx&quot;, &quot;falcis&quot; &quot;sickle&quot;. The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus had used the specific epithet &quot;biarmicus&quot; for the bearded reedling and Temminck clearly believed that the word meant &quot;bearded&quot; but it is likely that Linnaeus was using the Latinized form for Bjarmaland, a district in northern Russia. The English word &quot;lanner&quot; is believed to come from the Old French &quot;lanier&quot; meaning &quot;cowardly&quot;. The first recorded use of the word in English is from around 1400.

This is presumably the oldest living hierofalcon species. Support for this assumption comes mainly from biogeography agreeing better with the confusing pattern of DNA sequence data in this case than in others. Nonetheless, there is rampant hybridization (like the perilanner) and incomplete lineage sorting which confounds the data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small sample sizes cannot yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group.

In any case, the radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the Eemian interglacial at the start of the Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000–115,000 years ago; the lanner falcons would thus represent the lineage that became isolated in sub-Saharan Africa at some time during the Riss glaciation (200,000 to 130,000 years ago) already.

There are five recognised subspecies:
* &quot;F. b. biarmicus&quot; – The nominate subspecies, ranges from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to southern Kenya south to South Africa
* &quot;F. b. feldeggii&quot; – Italy to Turkey, Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran
* &quot;F. b. tanypterus&quot; – northeastern Africa to Arabia, Israel and Iraq
* &quot;F. b. erlangeri&quot; – northwestern Africa
* &quot;F. b. abyssinicus&quot; – southern Mauritania to Ethiopia and Somalia south to Cameroon and northern Kenya

==Description==
It is a large falcon, at length with a wingspan of . Eurasian lanner falcons (&quot;Falco biarmicus feldeggi&quot;, also called Feldegg&#x27;s falcon) have slate grey or brown-grey upperparts; most African subspecies are a paler blue grey above. The breast is streaked in northern birds, resembling greyish saker falcons, but the lanner has a reddish back to the head. Sexes are similar, but the browner young birds resemble saker falcons even more. However, sakers have a lighter top of the head and less clear head-side patterns. The lanner&#x27;s call is a harsh &quot;wray-e&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Lanner falcons are predominantly located in open habitats and can range from the forest edge to the desert. However, they are most commonly found in open savannah and sour grasslands. In South Africa, they commonly inhabit the east of the country in grasslands and move into the Fynbos, Nama Karoo and Southern Kalahari during the non-breeding season.

Despite this movement, they are not truly migratory birds, and are usually limited to local movements. These movements may be in response to seasonal rains and altitudes, where higher elevations are inhabited during breeding season, and lower elevations are inhabited out of breeding season.

They are bred in captivity for falconry; hybrids with the peregrine (&quot;perilanners&quot;) are also often seen. Merret (1666) claimed that the &quot;lanar&quot; lived in Sherwood Forest and the Forest of Dean in England; such populations would seem to have derived from escaped hunting birds of the nobility. Edward I of England (reigned 1272-1307), who had a passion for falconry, owned at least one lanner.

In the wild, lanner falcon numbers are strongly and steadily declining in Europe as well as in the whole North Africa, though the species remains relatively common in parts of Africa. In the Degua Tembien mountains of Ethiopia, it was observed to contribute to controlling pest rodents.

==Ecology==
=== Moulting ===
Females usually moult from September to January, after the nesting period is over. Whereas, males moult from November to May, once the chicks can hunt for themselves.

=== Diet ===
Lanner falcons most commonly prey on other birds, including doves, pigeons and domestic chickens or fowls. These falcons have also been seen to prey on small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. In Africa and Israel, lanner falcons were observed as hunting bats.

=== Hunting ===
It usually hunts by horizontal pursuit, rather than the peregrine falcon&#x27;s stoop from a height, and takes mainly bird prey in flight. However, these raptors make use of a multitude of hunting styles, including stooping after soaring, attacking from a perch, attacking from a fast, low coursing flight and aerial attacks from a perch. Lanner falcons also exhibit co-operative hunting with high success rate specifically when hunting jackdaws, where the use of visual contact is used to coordinate the chase. Males most commonly make the initial attack, yet the prey is usually caught by the female.

=== Behaviour ===
Before the breeding season, both males and females show mutual soaring and flapping flight which are closely synchronized from April to June. Near nesting sites, pairs have also been seen to power-dive together.

Once eggs are fledged, the female predominantly stays with and feeds the juveniles. However, the male takes over this role when the female needs to hunt. When the juveniles are about 25 days old, the female is commonly seen perched near the nest, but still spends a large amount of time in the nest with the juveniles. When the juveniles are about 39 days old, the female does not spend large amounts of time in the nest anymore and both the female and male are actively hunting.

=== Nesting habits ===
Lanner falcons usually nest on sheer cliff faces, and lay three or four eggs. They do not have strict nesting regulations and as a result are more common and do not show a patchy distribution. As a result they also make use of old crow nests and are sometimes seen nesting on pylons, trees and less steep cliff faces.

=== Breeding ===
Lanner falcon have a laying period in July which suggests a strategy to fledge young before the heat and heavy rain of the summer as well as before the influx of migratory birds during December to February. This timing may improve foraging conditions for juveniles which can increase the success of breeding. Breeding success for these falcons is largely affected by environmental conditions. The incubation period is thought to be 32 days and the nesting period to be 44 days. However, juveniles have been present near nests up  to ten weeks after fledgling. The mean fledgling rate is 2.24 young per successful pair which is typical of large falcons, however, the mean number of individuals fledged overall per territorial pair is 1.3 which is low and may be due to the number of unproductive years towards the end of each territory&#x27;s occupancy.

== Threats ==
Lanner falcons are of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, yet they can still be negatively affected through anthropogenic process, directly and indirectly.

Direct anthropogenic threats to these raptors include nest robbery, vehicle collisions, electrocution from power lines and persecution. As chicks can barely fly when leaving the nest they are vulnerable and easy to catch, they are threatened by being captured for falconries and through being caught and killed by angry farmers as a result of these birds sometimes preying on domestic chickens.

Indirect anthropogenic threats include loss of suitable habitats as a result of human expansion and the intensive use of pesticides for agriculture.

<text>Southeast (SE or S.E.) is the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and is located south of East Capitol Street and east of South Capitol Street. It includes the Capitol Hill and Anacostia neighborhoods, the Navy Yard, the Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling (JBAB), the U.S. Marine Barracks, the Anacostia River waterfront, Eastern Market, the remains of several Civil War-era forts, historic St. Elizabeths Hospital, RFK Stadium, Nationals Park, and the Congressional Cemetery. It also contains a landmark known as &quot;The Big Chair,&quot; located on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. The quadrant is split by the Anacostia River, with the portion that is west of the river sometimes referred to as &quot;Near Southeast&quot;. Geographically, it is the second-smallest quadrant of the city.

==Geography==
Southeast includes the 32 neighborhoods of:

* Anacostia
* Barney Circle
* Barry Farm
* Bellevue
* Benning Ridge
* Buena Vista
* Capitol Hill
* Capitol View
* Civic Betterment
* Congress Heights
* Douglass
* Dupont Park
* Fairfax Village
* Fairlawn
* Fort Davis
* Fort Dupont
* Fort Stanton
* Garfield Heights
* Good Hope
* Greenway
* Hillcrest
* Knox Hill
* Marshall Heights
* Navy Yard
* Naylor Gardens
* Penn Branch
* Randle Highlands
* Shipley Terrace
* Skyland
* Twining
* Washington Highland
* Woodland

==Government==
Politically, Southeast includes most of Ward 8, as well as much of Ward 6 and Ward 7. Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, D.C., served as D.C. Council Member for Ward 8 until his death on November 23, 2014.

==Culture==
Nationals Park, the current ballpark for Major League Baseball&#x27;s Washington Nationals, opened in Southeast in March 2008.

==Transportation==
Southeast Washington, D.C. is accessible via the Blue, Orange, Green and Silver Lines of the Washington Metro.

==Crime==
In years past, the quadrant was known by some Washington, D.C. metropolitan area residents as being plagued by a high crime rate, relative to the rest of the city.

==Demographics==
The population of Southeast is predominantly black. However, the African American population is concentrated southeast of the Anacostia River; the areas northwest of the Anacostia River are majority White. The portions of the quadrant southeast of the Anacostia are tree-lined and neighborly. However, shopping, dining, entertainment, and cultural options are limited, so some residents travel either downtown or to the suburbs for such services. There are several black middle class neighborhoods in Southeast, such as Hillcrest, Penn Branch, and Fort Dupont. The areas northwest of the Anacostia contains some of the wealthiest parts of the city, including the southern half of the famous and politically connected Capitol Hill neighborhood. Cultural events/activities include the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Birthday parade, the free weekly summer jazz concerts in Fort Dupont Park, the Fort Dupont ice-rink, the Anacostia Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, the Anacostia Arts Center, and THEARC tennis, arts and learning center for youth on Mississippi Avenue. The population of the southeast quadrant is roughly 226,084.

<text>Curtis Cokes (June 15, 1937 – May 29, 2020) was a boxer from Dallas, Texas, United States. Cokes was the simultaneous WBA, WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; World Welterweight Champion, and he was famous for his training regimen, which he also imposed on other boxers training with him.

==Pre-championship career==
On March 24, 1958, Cokes began to box professionally, defeating Manuel Gonzalez, whom he would later fight for the world title, in a six-round decision. He won eleven fights in a row, including a second match with Gonzalez, before losing to Gonzalez in their third fight, on April 27, 1959. His next fight, against Garland Randall on June 18 of the same year, ended in a three-round no contest. He and Randall had an immediate rematch and on August 27, he knocked out Randall in the first round. He had an additional fourteen fights, going 11-2-1 in that span (his one draw was against Kenny Lane, a boxer who twice challenged Carlos Ortiz for world championships), before facing Luis Rodriguez, another world welterweight champion, on September 3, 1961. He beat Rodriguez by a ten-round decision, outpointed Gonzalez in their fourth fight, and lost to Rodriguez in their second fight, also by points. He went 13–4 in his next seventeen fights, and, after losing in a ten-round decision to Eddie Pace at Los Angeles, California, on August 27, 1964, he announced his retirement. However, on October 14 of that year, he announced he was returning to boxing.

== Championship ==
After winning three fights in a row, he and Gonzalez were matched for a fifth time on August 24, 1966, this time for the WBA/WBC vacant world welterweight title, in New Orleans. Cokes outpointed Manuel Gonzalez to become world welterweight champion. On November 28, 1966, he retained the crown against Jean Josselin of France in a fifteen-round decision. Nat Fleischer was one of the judges for that fight.

On May 19, 1967, he retained the title with a tenth-round knockout of Francois Villeiman, and on October 2, he met Charlie Shipes, who was recognized as champion in California. He knocked Shipes out in eight rounds in Oakland.

On April 18, 1968, he retained his title with a fifth-round knockout of Willie Ludick, and on October 21, with a fifteen-round decision over Ramon La Cruz.

== Post-championship career ==
Cokes lost the world welterweight title on April 18, 1969, when he was knocked out by Cuban José Nápoles in thirteen rounds in Los Angeles. On June 29, the pair had a rematch in Nápoles&#x27; adopted hometown of Mexico City, Mexico, and Nápoles repeated his victory, this time by a tenth-round knockout.

Cokes had eleven more fights before retiring, winning seven, losing three and drawing in one. His last three fights were in South Africa. He retired after a ten-round decision win against Ezra Mnzinyane on October 5, 1972.

Cokes had a record of 62 wins, 14 losses and four draws, with 30 wins by knockout.

== After boxing ==
After retiring, Cokes became a trainer. He worked with fighters such as Quincy Taylor and Ike Ibeabuchi.

Cokes also made one film appearance in the year of his retirement. He appeared in the 1972 John Huston film &quot;Fat City&quot; alongside future Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges and Stacy Keach.

In 2003, Cokes was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Cokes died at age 82 of heart failure on May 29, 2020.

<text>Marvin&#x27;s Room is a 1996 American drama film directed by Jerry Zaks. The script was written by John Guare and based on the play of the same name by Scott McPherson, who died in 1992. McPherson had completed a screenplay for a film version before he died; however, Guare was hired to update it when the film eventually started production years later.

It stars Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Hume Cronyn, Gwen Verdon, Hal Scardino, and Dan Hedaya. Original music for the film was composed by Rachel Portman. Carly Simon wrote and performed the theme song &quot;Two Little Sisters&quot;, with Meryl Streep adding background vocals.

For her performance, Keaton received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Meanwhile, Streep was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

==Plot==
Marvin, a man who had a stroke 20 years ago, is left incapacitated and bedridden. He has been cared for by his daughter Bessie in their Florida home, and ignored by his other daughter, Lee, who moved to Ohio with her husband 20 years ago and has never contacted her family.

Now, however, Bessie&#x27;s doctor has informed her that she has leukemia (the same disease her and Lee&#x27;s mother died from in their youth) and needs a bone marrow transplant and she turns to her sister for help. Lee, in turn, turns to her 10-year-old son Charlie and 17-year-old son Hank, the latter of whom has been committed to a mental institution for setting fire to his mother&#x27;s house. However, the rebellious Hank says he won&#x27;t submit himself to be tested for a match.

Nevertheless, they all travel down to stay with Bessie. When Lee finds that she may have to take over her father&#x27;s care, she at first begins shopping around for nursing homes, fearing that she&#x27;ll have to uproot her life. Eventually, however, the estranged family grows close and Hank agrees to get tested.

As Bessie progressively seems to get worse, and testing shows the boys are not a match as bone marrow donors, Lee comes to terms that it is now her turn to take care of her family. The film closes with Lee familiarizing herself with her father&#x27;s medication, as she walks into his room with his lunch, overlooking Bessie flashing sunlight off the mirror that makes Marvin smile.

<text>Breaking The Waves is a 1996 psychological romantic melodrama film directed and co-written by Lars von Trier and starring Emily Watson in her feature film acting debut, and with Stellan Skarsgård, a frequent collaborator with von Trier.

Set in the Scottish Highlands in the early 1970s, it is about an unusual young woman and the love she has for her husband. The film is divided into seven chapters and an epilogue, separated by audio-visual art by Per Kirkeby and accompanied by music.

The film is an international co-production between the US, Denmark, seven other European countries, and is von Trier&#x27;s first feature film with his Danish production company Zentropa. As von Trier&#x27;s first film made after his founding of the Dogme 95 movement, it is heavily-influenced by the movement&#x27;s style and ethos. It is the first film in Trier&#x27;s &quot;Golden Heart&quot; trilogy, which includes &quot;The Idiots&quot; (1998) and &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000), the former made in compliance with the Dogme 95 Manifesto.

&quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; was well-received, with Emily Watson&#x27;s acting receiving unanimous critical praise and earning her first Academy Award nomination. The movie has been described as &quot;perhaps von Trier&#x27;s most widely acclaimed film&quot; and cited as among the best films of the 1990s. The film won numerous awards, including the Grand Prix at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==

Bess McNeill is a young and pretty Scottish woman who has, in the past, had treatment for unspecified mental health illness after the death of her brother. She marries oil rig worker Jan Nyman, a Danish non-churchgoer, despite disapproval from her community and her Free Scottish Presbyterian Calvinist church. Bess is steadfast and pure of heart but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with him in her own voice, believing that he is responding directly through her.

Bess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess, in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred and that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking him to neglect his job and return to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to the hospital.

Jan&#x27;s condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalize his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholely. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement, believing it will save her husband. Bess throws herself at Jan&#x27;s doctor, but when he rebuffs her, she takes to picking up men off the street and allowing herself to be brutalized in increasingly cruel sexual encounters. In the face of probable expulsion from her church, she proclaims, &quot;You cannot love words. You cannot be in love with a word. You can only love a human being. That&#x27;s perfection&quot;. The entire village is scandalised by these doings, and Bess is excommunicated.

Dodo and Jan&#x27;s doctor agree the only way to keep Bess safe from herself is to have her committed and move as far away from her husband - whom they believe to be in terminal decline - as possible. Bess decides to make what she thinks is the ultimate sacrifice for Jan: She unflinchingly returns to a derelict ship, where sailors brutally attack her. Dodo and Mrs. McNeill meet a severely injured Bess in the hospital for the last time, forgiving her for her actions. Bess dies in Dodo&#x27;s arms.

Her church deems her soul to be lost and hell-bound. Unbeknownst to the church elders, Jan and his friends have substituted bags of sand for Bess&#x27;s body inside her sealed coffin. Without notice to the church elders, Dodo condemns them, saying no-one has the right to consign Bess to hell. Later, Jan is shown, substantially restored to health despite the doctors not having thought it possible, burying Bess in the ocean, deep in grief. The film ends in magical realism as Bess&#x27;s body is nowhere to be seen on the sonar, and church bells ring from on high in the sky.

===Development===
&quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; was von Trier&#x27;s first film after founding the Dogme 95 movement with fellow Danish director Thomas Vinterberg. Nonetheless, the film breaks many of the movement&#x27;s &quot;rules&quot;, including built sets, post-dubbed music and computer graphics. It was shot entirely with handheld Super35mm cameras and is the first of von Trier&#x27;s Golden Heart trilogy, so named after a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Guldhjerte&quot; he had read about a little girl lost in the woods who gives away everything she has to others needier than herself. He wanted to make a naturalistic film that was also a religious film without any miracles. Von Trier claimed that it took him five years to write the film and get financial backing, and he began to lose enthusiasm for it right after filming began. It had a budget of 42 million kroner.

Helena Bonham Carter was von Trier&#x27;s first choice to play the role of Bess, but she dropped out just before shooting was to start, reportedly due to the large amount of nudity and sexuality required by the role. Several other big-name actresses were considered, but none of them was comfortable with the subject matter. Von Trier was eventually won over by Emily Watson&#x27;s audition, even though she was a complete unknown in the film industry at the time. She was expelled from the School of Philosophy and Economic Science for having played such an explicit role in the film.

===Filming===
Von Trier initially wanted to film the exterior scenes on the west coast of Jutland, then in Norway, then in Ostende, Belgium, then in Ireland, before finally settling on Scotland. The graveyard was built for the film on the Isle of Skye; the church is in Lochailort, the harbour in Mallaig, and the beach in Morar. Von Trier chose the Isle of Skye because it was popular with 19th century English romantic painters and writers. The interiors were shot at Det Danske Filmstudie in Lyngby, Denmark.
Principal photography began on 7 August 1995 and completed shooting on 20 October 1995.
Emily Watson revealed that originally, in the script, the scene of Bess&#x27; wedding night was much more traditional, with Bess getting undressed.

==Style==
The film is divided into seven different chapters. Each chapter begins with a different impressionistically filmed panorama title frame featuring early 1970s rock music interludes. Each of these chapters is filmed with a motionless camera, but features movement in the panorama. In the original released film, the epilogue, &quot;The Funeral&quot;, features David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, which was replaced by Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot; on early home video releases; the more recent Criterion edition restores the Bowie song. The overall style is heavily influenced by the realist Dogme 95 movement, of which von Trier was a founding member, and its grainy images and hand-held photography give it the superficial aesthetic of a Dogme film. However, the Dogme rules demand the use of real locations, whereas many of the locations in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; were constructed in a studio. In addition, the film is set in the past and contains dubbed music, as well as a brief scene featuring CGI, none of which is permitted by the Dogme rules.

Some saw &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; as mainstream cinema. Others saw it as a high budget experimental film due to its elaborate chapter shots and handheld camera in a sketchy raw style that followed the actors closely. &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; marked an important change in focus for Lars von Trier. In von Trier&#x27;s early films, the protagonist is a man, typically a disillusioned idealist whose downfall is furthered by a deceitful, fatal woman. In this film, for the first time the protagonist is a woman, emotional and naive. This motif continues in several of his later films, such as &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Dogville&quot;, and &quot;Manderlay&quot;. &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; controversially connects religion with phallocentrism. The film focuses on sexual perversity and female martyrdom, issues that continue in Trier&#x27;s later work. Some critics see the self-sacrificing submissive heroine as a misogynist cliche.

The film was made using Panavision equipment. The low-res look of the scenes was obtained by transferring the film to video, and then back to film again. According to von Trier, &quot;what we did was take a style and lay it like a filter over the story. It&#x27;s like decoding a television signal when you pay to see a film. Here we encoded the film, and the audience has to decode it. The raw, documentary style that I imposed on the film, which actually dissolves and contradicts it, means that we can accept the story as it is&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

The film garnered an 85% approval rating, and an average rating of 8.24/10 on Rotten Tomatoes from 59 reviews. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; offers a remarkable testament to writer-director Lars von Trier&#x27;s insight and filmmaking skill -- and announces Emily Watson as a startling talent&quot;. It also holds an 82/100 rating on Metacritic based on 28 reviews, citing a &quot;universal acclaim&quot; reception. During a show where film personalities listed their top movies of the 1990s, &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; was named one of the ten best films of the decade by both critic Roger Ebert and director Martin Scorsese.

In an essay for the Criterion Collection, David Sterritt interpreted it as a film in which &quot;no one is &#x27;bad&#x27;, everyone is &#x27;good&#x27;, and when trouble flares anyway, it&#x27;s because incompatible concepts of &#x27;good&#x27; can violently conflict with one another&quot;; he praised the ending as &quot;a magical vision that elevates the final moments to radically metaphysical heights&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed over $23 million worldwide including $4.6 million in France; $4 million in the US and Canada; $1.7 million in Italy; and $1.1 million in the UK.

===Accolades===
==Operatic adaptation==
Composer Missy Mazzoli and librettist Royce Vavrek premiered their operatic adaptation of the film on 22 September 2016, at Opera Philadelphia. The work was called &quot;the most startling and moving new American opera in memory&quot; by parterre box, with &quot;Opera News&quot; proclaiming that it &quot;stands among the best twenty-first-century American operas yet produced&quot;.

==Home media==
The Criterion Collection initially released the film in the United States in 1997 on LaserDisc in a director&#x27;s approved 2-disc edition and featured four deleted scenes selected by Lars von Trier, the complete European director&#x27;s cut, a promo clip prepared by Lars von Trier for the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and the U.S. theatrical trailer. On 27 January 1998, the film was made available on VHS format courtesy of Artisan Entertainment in an edited cut, while a subsequent DVD release was made available from Artisan on 25 July 2000, in a non-anamorphic edition and lacking the special features which appeared on Criterion&#x27;s LaserDisc edition. Criterion again reacquired home distribution rights to the film and released a Dual-Format digipack 1-disc Blu-ray and 2-disc DVD edition on 15 April 2014. The set contains a new 4k transfer and DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, most of the previous restored special features from the original LaserDisc, in addition to new select-scene audio commentary featuring von Trier, editor Anders Refn, and location scout Anthony Dod Mantle, new interview with filmmaker and critic Stig Björkman, new interviews with actors Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgård, interview from 2004 with actor Adrian Rawlins, excerpts from Watson&#x27;s audition tape, with commentary by von Trier, deleted scene featuring late actor Katrin Cartlidge and a booklet featuring an essay by critic David Sterritt and an excerpt from the 1999 book &quot;Trier on von Trier&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; was first released on VHS home video on 28 April 1997, while a second VHS was released in a &#x27;Special Widescreen Edition&#x27; on 1 October 1999 via Pathé. Pathé made the film available on DVD format on 1 September 2003, and featured its original aspect ratio in a 16:9 anamorphic screen, with Dolby Digital English 5.1, Italian 2.0 dub and multiple subtitle options. The special features include select commentary from Lars von Trier and Anders Refn interviewed by Anthony Dod Mantle. Curzon Artificial Eye currently occupy distribution rights in the UK and have released the film on DVD and on Blu-ray on 10 November 2014. Curzon featured their 4k restoration on Blu-Ray in their Lars Von Trier Collection box set in 2023, and then in a 4K Blu-Ray release soon after.

<text>Cecily Brooke von Ziegesar ( ; born June 27, 1970) is an American author best known for the young adult &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series of novels.

==Early life and education==
Cecily von Ziegesar was born in New York City into a German noble family. She is the daughter of Franz Albrecht von Ziegesar, the CEO and Chairman of Bowne &amp; Co., and his second wife, Olivia James. She is the half-sister of writer Peter von Ziegesar. Her childhood dream was to grow up to be a ballerina; she began lessons at age three and auditioned for the School of American Ballet at age eight, but was rejected. As a teenager, she commuted from Connecticut to Manhattan at 6:00 a.m. every day to attend The Nightingale-Bamford School. After graduating from Nightingale, von Ziegesar attended Colby College. Then she spent a year in Budapest working for a local radio station. She then returned to the United States to study creative writing at the University of Arizona, only to drop out shortly thereafter.

==Career==
===&quot;Gossip Girl&quot;===

====Book series====
In New York City, while working at book-packaging firm Alloy Entertainment, she became inspired to create the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; series, which presents a view of high-end teenage lifestyles. The series climbed to the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best-Sellers list in 2002. A spin-off book series, &quot;The It Girl&quot;, made the list in 2005.

The Constance Billard School for Girls is based on an exaggerated version of Ziegesar&#x27;s own alma mater, Nightingale.

In October 2011, Ziegesar released a spin-off of her first novel: &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;.

====Television series====

&quot;Gossip Girl&quot; was adapted for television by The CW in 2007. Though fans of the book series criticized it for veering away from the book in plot and character personalities, Ziegesar stated that the major plot outline remained true to her vision, and that she was pleased that &quot;at least it takes place in New York City&quot;. On May 16, 2011, Ziegesar herself made a cameo appearance in the fourth season finale.

====Graphic novel series====
In December 2009, Yen Press announced that it was working with South Korean artist Baek Hye-Kyung to create a graphic novel adaptation of the series titled &quot;Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only&quot;. Rather than adapting the original novels, however, the graphic novels will feature original stories with the same characters. It will be serialized in the company&#x27;s anthology magazine &quot;Yen Plus&quot;, with the first chapter appearing in the January 2010 issue.

==Personal life==
Von Ziegesar resides in the Columbia Street Waterfront District, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, with her husband Richard, who is Chief Operating Officer of the Judd Foundation, and their children Agnes Belle von Ziegesar Griggs and Oscar von Ziegesar Griggs.

<doc id="781982" wikidata="Q1931144" url="?curid=781982" title="Show (The Cure album)">
<text>Show is a live album released in 1993 by the British alternative rock band the Cure. It was recorded live over two nights at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Auburn Hills, Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) in 1992, during the successful &quot;Wish&quot; tour. &quot;Show&quot; was also released as a concert video.

This live album was released along with &quot;Paris&quot;, which was recorded in Paris. &quot;Show&quot; leaned somewhat more towards the band&#x27;s poppier and more recent material such as &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;, &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&quot; while &quot;Paris&quot; skewed towards their older cult-classics.

The album was re-issued on vinyl as a double LP in the UK as part of Record Store Day on 22 April 2023. This release was remastered by Robert Smith and Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios.

==Track listing==
&quot;Show&quot; is a double-CD release in most cases. There are various versions with differing track listings. The US version is the only one-disc edition. The songs that did not fit onto the US disc (&quot;Tape&quot;, &quot;Fascination Street&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;) were released as the EP &quot;Sideshow&quot;. The video version, released on VHS, CD-i and LaserDisc, contains extra tracks.

<doc id="781984" wikidata="Q1813603" url="?curid=781984" title="Gastric bypass surgery">
<text>Gastric bypass surgery refers to a technique in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower &quot;remnant&quot; pouch, where the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures (GBP). Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.

The operation is prescribed to treat severe obesity (defined as a body mass index greater than 40), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and other comorbid conditions. &quot;Bariatric surgery&quot; is the term encompassing &quot;all&quot; of the surgical treatments for severe obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up only one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically dramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of gastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to 40%. As with all surgery, complications may occur. A study from 2005 to 2006 revealed that 15% of patients experienced complications as a result of gastric bypass, and 0.5% of patients died within six months of surgery due to complications. A meta-analysis of 174,772 participants published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 2021 found that bariatric surgery was associated with 59% and 30% reduction in all-cause mortality among obese adults with or without type 2 diabetes respectively. This meta-analysis also found that median life-expectancy was 9.3 years longer for obese adults with diabetes who received bariatric surgery as compared to routine (non-surgical) care, whereas the life expectancy gain was 5.1 years longer for obese adults without diabetes.

== Uses ==
Gastric bypass is indicated for the surgical treatment of severe obesity, a diagnosis which is made when the patient is seriously obese, has been unable to achieve satisfactory and sustained weight loss by dietary efforts and has comorbid conditions that are either life-threatening or serious impairment to the quality of life.

Before 1991, clinicians interpreted serious obesity as weighing at least more than the &quot;ideal body weight&quot;, an actuarially determined body weight at which one was estimated to be likely to live the longest, as determined by the life-insurance industry. This criterion failed for persons of short stature.

In 1991, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a consensus panel whose recommendations have set the standard for consideration of surgical treatment, the body mass index (BMI). The BMI is defined as the body weight (in kilograms), divided by the square of the height (in meters). The result is expressed as a number in kilograms per square meter. In healthy adults, BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9, with a BMI above 30 considered obese, and a BMI less than 18.5 considered underweight.

The Consensus Panel of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommended the following criteria for consideration of bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass procedures:
* people who have a BMI of 40 or higher
* people with a BMI of 35 or higher with one or more related comorbid conditions

The Consensus Panel also emphasized the necessity of multidisciplinary care of the bariatric surgical patient by a team of physicians and therapists to manage associated comorbidities and nutrition, physical activity, behavior, and psychological needs. The surgical procedure is best regarded as a &quot;tool&quot; that enables the patient to alter lifestyle and eating habits, and to achieve effective and permanent management of obesity and eating behavior.

Since 1991, major developments in the field of bariatric surgery, particularly laparoscopy, have outdated some of the conclusions of the NIH panel. In 2004 the American Society for Bariatric Surgery (ASBS) sponsored a consensus conference which updated the evidence and the conclusions of the NIH panel. This conference, composed of physicians and scientists of both surgical and non-surgical disciplines, reached several conclusions, including:
* bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity
* gastric bypass is one of four types of operations for severe obesity
* laparoscopic surgery is equally effective and as safe as open surgery
* patients should undergo comprehensive preoperative evaluation and have multi-disciplinary support for optimum outcome
In recent comparisons with sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass has shown slightly better outcomes in diabetes remission and weight maintenance. According to a 2021 evidence update, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients were more likely to maintain weight loss over five years, with a reduced relapse rate in Type 2 diabetes. However, RYGB was associated with a higher frequency of follow-up surgeries and hospitalizations due to complications.

==Surgical techniques==
The gastric bypass, in its various forms, accounts for a large majority of the bariatric surgical procedures performed. It is estimated that 200,000 such operations were performed in the United States in 2008.

Laparoscopic surgery is performed using several small incisions, or &quot;ports&quot;: one to insert a surgical telescope connected to a video camera, and others to permit access to specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views the operation on a video screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.

The Roux-en-Y laparoscopic gastric bypass, first performed and reported on in case studies between 1993 and 1994, is regarded as one of the most difficult procedures to perform by limited access techniques. The use of this method has greatly popularized the operation due to associated benefits such as a shortened hospital stay, reduced discomfort, shorter recovery time, less scarring, and minimal risk of incisional hernia.

===Essential features===
The gastric bypass procedure consists of:
* Creation of a small, (15–30 ml/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch from the upper stomach, accompanied by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 ml and variable). This restricts the volume of food that can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (like a wall between two rooms in a house or two office cubicles next to each other with a partition wall in between them—and typically by the use of surgical staples), or it may be divided into two separate/separated parts (also with staples). Total division (separate/separated parts) is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together (&quot;fistulize&quot;) and negate the operation.
* Re-construction of the GI tract to enable drainage of both segments of the stomach. The particular technique used for this reconstruction produces several variants of the operation, differing in the lengths of the small intestine used, the degree to which food absorption is affected, and the likelihood of adverse nutritional effects. Usually, a segment of the small bowel (called the ) is brought up to the proximal remains of the stomach.

===Variations===
====Gastric bypass, Roux-en-Y (RYGB, proximal)====
This variant is the most commonly employed gastric bypass technique and is by far the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States. The small intestine is divided approximately below the lower stomach outlet and is re-arranged into a Y-configuration, enabling outflow of food from the small upper stomach pouch via a &quot;Roux limb&quot;. In the proximal version, the Y-intersection is formed near the upper (proximal) end of the small intestine. The Roux limb is constructed using of the small intestine, preserving the rest (and the majority) of it from absorbing nutrients. The patient will experience a very rapid onset of the stomach feeling full, followed by a growing satiety (or &quot;indifference&quot; to food) shortly after the start of a meal.

====Gastric bypass, Roux-en-Y (RYGB, distal)====
The small intestine is normally 20 - 22 ft (6 - 6.7 m) in length. As the Y-connection is moved further down the gastrointestinal tract, the amount available to fully absorb nutrients is progressively reduced, traded for greater effectiveness of the operation. The Y-connection is formed much closer to the lower (distal) end of the small intestine, usually from the lower end, causing reduced absorption (malabsorption) of food: primarily of fats and starches, but also of various minerals and the fat-soluble vitamins. The unabsorbed fats and starches pass into the large intestine, where bacterial actions may act on them to produce irritants and malodorous gases. These larger effects on nutrition are traded for a relatively modest increase in total weight loss.

====Mini-gastric bypass (MGB)====
The mini-gastric bypass procedure was first developed by Robert Rutledge from the US in 1997, as a modification of the standard Billroth II procedure. A mini gastric bypass creates a long narrow tube of the stomach along its right border (the lesser curvature). A loop of the small gut is brought up and hooked to this tube at about 180 cm from the start of the intestine.

Numerous studies show that the loop reconstruction (Billroth II gastrojejunostomy) works more safely when placed low on the stomach, but can be a disaster when placed adjacent to the esophagus. Today thousands of &quot;loops&quot; are used for surgical procedures to treat gastric problems such as ulcers, stomach cancer, and injury to the stomach. The mini-gastric bypass uses the low set loop reconstruction and thus has rare chances of bile reflux.

The MGB has been suggested as an alternative to the Roux-en-Y procedure due to the simplicity of its construction and is becoming more and more popular because of low risk of complications and good sustained weight loss. It has been estimated that 15.4% of weight loss surgery in Asia is now performed via the MGB technique.

====Endoscopic duodenal-jejunal bypass====
This technique has been clinically researched since the mid-2000s. It involves the implantation of a duodenal-jejunal bypass liner between the beginning of the duodenum (first portion of the small intestine from the stomach) and the mid-jejunum (the secondary stage of the small intestine). This prevents the partially digested food from entering the first and initial part of the secondary stage of the small intestine, mimicking the effects of the biliopancreatic portion of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Despite a handful of serious adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and device migration – all resolved with device removal – initial clinical trials have produced promising results in the treatment&#x27;s ability to improve weight loss and glucose homeostasis outcomes.

== Physiology ==
The gastric bypass reduces the size of the stomach by well over 90%. A normal stomach can stretch, sometimes to over 1000 mL, while the pouch of the gastric bypass may be 15 mL in size. The gastric bypass pouch is usually formed from the part of the stomach that is least susceptible to stretching. That, and its small original size, prevents any significant long-term change in pouch volume. What does change, over time, is the size of the connection between the stomach and intestine and the ability of the small intestine to hold a greater volume of food. Over time, the functional capacity of the pouch increases; by that time, weight loss has occurred, and the increased capacity should serve to allow maintenance of a lower body weight.

When the patient ingests just a small amount of food, the first response is a stretching of the wall of the stomach pouch, stimulating nerves that tell the brain that the stomach is full. The patient feels a sensation of fullness as if they had just eaten a large meal—but with just a thimbleful of food. Most people do not stop eating simply in response to a feeling of fullness, but the patient rapidly learns that subsequent bites must be eaten very slowly and carefully, to avoid increasing discomfort or vomiting.

Food is first churned in the stomach before passing into the small intestine. When the lumen of the small intestine comes into contact with nutrients, several hormones are released, including cholecystokinin from the duodenum and PYY and GLP-1 from the ileum. These hormones inhibit further food intake and have thus been dubbed &quot;satiety factors&quot;. &quot;Ghrelin&quot; is a hormone that is released in the stomach that stimulates hunger and food intake. Changes in circulating hormone levels after gastric bypass have been hypothesized to produce reductions in food intake and body weight in obese patients. However, these findings remain controversial, and the exact mechanisms by which gastric bypass surgery reduces food intake and body weight have yet to be elucidated.

For example, it is still widely perceived that gastric bypass works by mechanical means, i.e. food restriction and/or malabsorption. Recent clinical and animal studies, however, have indicated that these long-held inferences about the mechanisms of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may not be correct. A growing body of evidence suggests that profound changes in body weight and metabolism resulting from RYGB cannot be explained by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. One study in rats found that RYGB induced a 19% increase in total and a 31% increase in resting energy expenditure, an effect not exhibited in vertical sleeve gastrectomy rats. In addition, pair-fed rats lost only 47% as much weight as their RYGB counterparts. Changes in food intake after RYGB only partially account for RYGB-induced weight loss, and there is no evidence of clinically significant malabsorption of calories contributing to weight loss. Thus, it appears RYGB affects weight loss by altering the physiology of weight regulation and eating behavior rather than by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. This hypothesis suggesting altered physiology is highly debated, and has no primary evidence supporting it. Anecdotal evidence is clear in that following gastric bypass surgery, eating after stomach distension causes nausea, discomfort, and vomiting, so patients very quickly learn to avoid overeating, which is agreed to be the main cause of weight loss following the surgery.

To gain the maximum benefit from this physiology, it is important that the patient eat only at mealtimes, 5 to 6 small meals daily, and &quot;not&quot; graze between meals. Concentration on obtaining 80–100 g of daily protein is necessary. Meals after surgery are – cup, slowly getting to 1 cup by one year. This requires a change in eating behavior and an alteration of long-acquired habits for finding food. In almost every case where weight gain occurs late after surgery, the capacity for a meal has not greatly increased. Some assume the cause of regaining weight must be the patient&#x27;s fault, e.g. eating between meals with high-caloric snack foods, though this has been debated. Others believe it is an unpredictable failure or limitation of the surgery for certain patients (e.g. reactive hypoglycemia).

==Complications==
Any major surgery involves the potential for complications—adverse events that increase risk, hospital stay, and mortality. Some complications are common to all abdominal operations, while some are specific to bariatric surgery.

===Mortality and complication rates===
The overall rate of complications during the 30 days following surgery ranges from 7% for laparoscopic procedures to 14.5% for operations through open incisions. One study on mortality revealed a 0% mortality rate out of 401 laparoscopic cases, and 0.6% out of 955 open procedures. Similar mortality rates—30-day mortality of 0.11%, and 90-day mortality of 0.3%—have been recorded in the U.S. Centers of Excellence program, the results being from 33,117 operations at 106 centers.

Mortality and complications are affected by pre-existing risk factors such as degree of obesity, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and history of prior pulmonary embolism. It is also affected by the experience of the operating surgeon: the learning curve for laparoscopic bariatric surgery is estimated to be about 100 cases. Supervision and experience are important when selecting a surgeon, as the way a surgeon becomes experienced in dealing with problems is by encountering and solving them.

===Complications of abdominal surgery===

====Infection====
Infection of the incisions or the inside of the abdomen (peritonitis, abscess) may occur due to the release of bacteria from the bowel during the operation. Nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, bladder or kidney infections, and sepsis (blood-borne infection) are also possible. Effective short-term use of antibiotics, diligent respiratory therapy, and encouragement of activity within a few hours after surgery can reduce the risks of infections.

====Venous thromboembolism====
Any injury, such as a surgical operation, causes the body to increase the coagulation of the blood. Simultaneously, activity may be reduced.
Gastric Bypass Surgery is done with minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopy). Due to insufflation of the abdominal cavity with for the surgery, the venous return is diminished and this will lead to deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities. There is an increased probability of the formation of clots in the veins of the legs, or sometimes the pelvis, particularly in severely obese patients. A clot that breaks free and floats to the lungs is called a pulmonary embolus, a very dangerous occurrence. Blood thinners are commonly administered before surgery to reduce the probability of this type of complication.

====Hemorrhage====
Many blood vessels must be cut to divide the stomach and to move the bowel. Any of these may later begin bleeding, either into the abdomen (intra-abdominal hemorrhage) or into the bowel itself (gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Transfusions may be needed, and re-operation is sometimes necessary. The use of blood thinners to prevent venous thromboembolic disease may increase the risk of hemorrhage slightly.

====Hernia====
A hernia is an abnormal opening, either within the abdomen or through the abdominal wall muscles. An internal hernia may result from surgery and re-arrangement of the bowel and is a cause of bowel obstruction. Antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery has been estimated to result in internal hernia in 0.2% of cases, mainly through Petersen&#x27;s defect. An incisional hernia occurs when a surgical incision does not heal well; the muscles of the abdomen separate and allow protrusion of a sac-like membrane, which may contain bowel or other abdominal contents, and which can be painful and unsightly. The risk of abdominal-wall hernia is markedly decreased in laparoscopic surgery.

====Bowel obstruction====
Abdominal surgery always results in some scarring of the bowel, called adhesions. A hernia, either internal or through the abdominal wall, may also result. When the bowel becomes trapped by adhesions or a hernia, it may become kinked and obstructed, sometimes many years after the original procedure. An operation is usually necessary to correct this problem.

===Complications of gastric bypass===

====Anastomotic leakage====
An anastomosis is a surgical connection between the stomach and bowel, or between two parts of the bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a water-tight connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which makes a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body&#x27;s natural healing abilities and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an anastomosis can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy).

====Anastomotic stricture====
As the anastomosis heals, it forms scar tissue, which naturally tends to shrink (&quot;contract&quot;) over time, making the opening smaller. This is called a &quot;stricture&quot;. Usually, the passage of food through an anastomosis will keep it stretched open, but if the inflammation and healing process outpaces the stretching process, scarring may make the opening so small that even liquids can no longer pass through it. The solution is a procedure called gastro endoscopy, and stretching of the connection by inflating a balloon inside it. Sometimes this manipulation may have to be performed more than once to achieve lasting correction.

====Anastomotic ulcer====
Ulceration of the anastomosis occurs in 1–16% of patients. Possible causes of such ulcers are:
* Restricted blood supply to the anastomosis (compared to the blood supply available to the original stomach)
* Anastomosis tension
* Gastric acid
* The bacteria &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;
* Smoking
* Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
This condition can be treated with:
* Proton pump inhibitors, e.g. esomeprazole
* A cytoprotectant and acid buffering agent, e.g. sucralfate
* Temporary restriction of the consumption of solid foods

====Dumping syndrome====
Normally, the pyloric valve at the lower end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a physiological reaction called dumping syndrome. The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack. The person usually has to lie down and could be very uncomfortable for 30–45 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.

=== Nutritional deficiencies ===
Nutritional deficiencies are common after gastric bypass surgery and are often not recognized. They include:
* Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to inadequate absorption of calcium may occur in GBP patients. Calcium is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is bypassed by the surgery. Most patients can achieve adequate calcium absorption by supplementation with vitamin D and calcium citrate (carbonate may not be absorbed—it requires an acidic stomach, which is bypassed).
* Iron frequently is seriously deficient, particularly in menstruating females, and must be supplemented. Again, it is normally absorbed in the duodenum. Ferrous sulfate can cause considerable GI distress in normal doses; alternatives include ferrous fumarate, or a chelated form of iron. Occasionally, a female patient develops severe anemia, even with supplements, and must be treated with parenteral iron. The signs of iron deficiency include: brittle nails, an inflamed tongue, constipation, depression, headaches, fatigue, and mouth lesions.
* Signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency may also occur such as acne, eczema, white spots on the nails, hair loss, depression, amnesia, and lethargy.
* Deficiency of thiamine (also known as vitamin B1) brings the risk of permanent neurological damage (i.e. Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy or polyneuropathy). Signs of thiamin deficiency are heart failure, memory loss, numbness of the hands, constipation, and loss of appetite.
* Vitamin B12 requires intrinsic factor from the gastric mucosa to be absorbed. In patients with a small gastric pouch, it may not be absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in pernicious anemia and neuropathies. Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite common after gastric bypass surgery with reported rates of 30% in some clinical trials. Sublingual B12 (cyanocobalamin) appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B12 does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.
* Protein malnutrition is a real risk. Some patients experience troublesome vomiting after surgery, until their GI tract adjusts to the changes, and &quot;cannot&quot; eat adequate amounts even with 6 meals a day. Many patients require protein supplementation during the early phases of rapid weight loss to prevent excessive loss of muscle mass. Hair loss is also a risk of protein malnutrition.
* Vitamin A deficiencies generally occur as a result of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. This often comes after intestinal bypass procedures such as jejunoileal bypass (no longer performed) or biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch procedures. In these procedures, fat absorption is markedly impaired. There is also the possibility of a vitamin A deficiency with the use of the weight-loss medication orlistat (marketed as Xenical and Alli).
* Folate deficiency is also a common occurrence in gastric bypass surgery patients.

====Nutritional effects====
After surgery, patients feel fullness after ingesting only a small volume of food, followed soon thereafter by a sense of satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon&#x27;s instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes prenatal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.

Total food intake and absorbance rate of food will rapidly decline after gastric bypass surgery, and the number of acid-producing cells lining the stomach increases. Doctors often prescribe acid-lowering medications to counteract the high acidity levels. Many patients then experience a condition known as achlorhydria, where there is not enough acid in the stomach. As a result of the low acidity levels, patients can develop an overgrowth of bacteria. A study conducted on 43 post-operative patients revealed that almost all of the patients tested positive for a hydrogen breath test, which indicated an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth causes the gut ecology to change and induces nausea and vomiting. Recurring nausea and vomiting eventually change the absorbance rate of food, contributing to the vitamin and nutrition deficiencies common in post-operative gastric bypass patients.

=====Protein nutrition=====
Proteins are essential food substances, contained in foods such as meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, eggs, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts. With a reduced ability to eat a large volume of food, gastric bypass patients must focus on eating their protein requirements first, and with each meal. In some cases, surgeons may recommend the use of a liquid protein supplement. Powdered protein supplements added to smoothies or any food can be an important part of the post-op diet.

=====Calorie nutrition=====
The profound weight loss that occurs after bariatric surgery is due to taking in much less energy (calories) than the body needs to use every day. Fat tissue must be burned to offset the deficit, and weight loss results. Eventually, as the body becomes smaller, its energy requirements are decreased, while the patient simultaneously finds it possible to eat somewhat more food. When the energy consumed is equal to the calories eaten, weight loss will stop. Proximal GBP typically results in loss of 60–80% of excess body weight, and very rarely leads to excessive weight loss. The risk of excessive weight loss is slightly greater with distal GBP.

=====Vitamins=====
Vitamins are normally contained in foods and supplements. The amount of food eaten after GBP is severely reduced, and vitamin content is correspondingly lowered. Supplements should therefore be taken to complete minimum daily requirements of all vitamins and minerals. Pre-natal vitamins are sometimes suggested by doctors, as they contain more of certain vitamins than most multivitamins. Absorption of most vitamins is not seriously affected after proximal GBP, although vitamin B12 may not be well-absorbed in some persons: sublingual preparations of B12 provide adequate absorption. Some studies suggest that GBP patients who took probiotics after surgery can absorb and retain higher amounts of B12 than patients who did not take probiotics after surgery. After a distal GBP, fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E may not be well-absorbed, particularly if fat intake is large. Water-dispersed forms of these vitamins may be indicated on specific physician recommendations. For some patients, sublingual B12 is not enough, and patients may require B12 injections.

=====Minerals=====
All versions of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium &quot;carbonate&quot; preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200 mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as a good way to get calcium.

=====Alcohol metabolism=====
Post-operative gastric bypass patients develop a lowered tolerance for alcoholic beverages because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol at a faster rate than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took an average of 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.

=====Pica=====
There have been reported cases in which pica recurs after gastric bypass in patients with a pre-operative history of the disorder, which is possibly due to iron deficiency. Pica is a compulsive tendency to eat substances other than normal food. Some examples would be people eating paper, clay, plaster, ashes, or ice. Low levels of iron and hemoglobin are common in patients who have undergone gastric bypass. One study reported on a female post-operative gastric bypass patient who was consuming eight to ten 32 oz. glasses of ice a day. The patient&#x27;s blood test revealed iron levels of 2.3 mmol/L and hemoglobin level of 5.83 mmol/L. Normal iron blood levels of adult women are 30 to 126 μg/dL and normal hemoglobin levels are 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL. This deficiency in the patient&#x27;s iron levels may have led to an increase in Pica activity. The patient was then given iron supplements that brought her hemoglobin and iron blood levels to normal levels. After one month, the patient&#x27;s eating diminished to two to three glasses of ice per day. After one year of taking iron supplements the patient&#x27;s iron and hemoglobin levels remained in a normal range and the patient reported that she did not have any further cravings for ice.

== Results and health benefits of gastric bypass ==
Weight loss of 65–80% of excess body weight is typical of most large series of gastric bypass operations reported. The medically more significant effects include a dramatic reduction in comorbid conditions:
* Hyperlipidemia is corrected in over 70% of patients.
* Essential hypertension is relieved in over 70% of patients, and medication requirements are usually reduced in the remainder.
* Obstructive sleep apnea improves markedly with weight loss and bariatric surgery may be curative for sleep apnea. Snoring is also reduced in most patients.
* Type 2 diabetes is reversed in up to 90% of patients usually leading to a normal blood-sugar level without medication, sometimes within days of surgery.

 Furthermore, Type 2 diabetes is prevented by more than 30-fold in patients with pre-diabetes. All these findings were first reported by Walter Pories and Jose F. Caro.
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease is relieved in almost all patients.
* Venous thromboembolic disease signs such as leg swelling are typically alleviated.
* Lower-back pain and joint pain are typically relieved or improved in nearly all patients.
A study in a large prospective study of 2010 obese patients showed a 29% reduction in mortality up to 15 years following surgery (hazard ratio 0.71 when adjusted for sex, age, and risk factors), compared to a non-surgically treated group of 2037 patients. A meta-analysis of 174772 participants published in The Lancet in 2021 found that bariatric surgery was associated with 59% and 30% reduction in all-cause mortality among obese adults with or without type 2 diabetes respectively. This meta-analysis also found that median life expectancy was 9.3 years longer for obese adults with diabetes who received bariatric surgery as compared to routine (non-surgical) care, whereas the life expectancy gain was 5.1 years longer for obese adults without diabetes.

Concurrently, most patients can enjoy greater participation in family and social activities.

== Cost of gastric bypass ==
The patient&#x27;s out-of-pocket cost for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery varies widely depending on the method of payment, region, surgical practice, and hospital in which the procedure is performed.

Methods of payment in the United States include private insurance, such as Individual &amp; Family coverage, Small Group coverage through an employer (Under 50 full-time employees) and Large Group coverage through an employer (50 or more full-time employees), public insurance (Medicare and Medicaid), and self-pay. Out-of-pocket costs for a patient with private or public insurance that specifically lists bariatric surgery as a covered benefit include several insurance-policy-specific parameters such as deductible levels, coinsurance percentages, copay amounts, and out-of-pocket limits.

Patients without insurance must pay for surgery directly (or through a third-party lender), and total out-of-pocket costs will depend on the surgical practice they choose and the hospital in which the surgical practice performs the procedure. On average, the total cost of gastric bypass surgery is about $24,000 in the United States, although on a state-specific level it ranges from an average of $15,000 (Arkansas) to an average of $57,000 (Alaska).

In Germany a gastric bypass operation, if not covered by health insurance and therefore paid privately, costs up to €15,000; in Switzerland CHF 20,000–25,000, in Poland gastric bypass costs around £4,000, whereas in Turkey it costs £3,200.

== Living with gastric bypass ==
Gastric bypass surgery has an emotional and physiological impact on the individual. Many who have undergone the surgery develop depression in the following months as a result of a change in the role food plays in their emotional well-being. Strict limitations on the diet can place great emotional strain on the patient. Energy levels in the period following the surgery can be low, both due to the restriction of food intake and negative changes in emotional state. It may take as long as three months for emotional levels to rebound.

Muscular weakness in the months following surgery is also common. This is caused by many factors, including a restriction on protein intake, a resulting loss in muscle mass, and a decline in energy levels. Muscle weakness may result in balance problems, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects, and increased fatigue following simple physical tasks. Many of these issues pass over time as food intake gradually increases. However, the first months following the surgery can be very difficult, an issue not often mentioned by physicians suggesting the surgery. The benefits and risks of this surgery are well established; however, the psychological effects are not well understood.

Even if physical activity is increased, patients may still harbor long-term psychological effects due to excess skin and fat. Often bypass surgery is followed up with &quot;body lifts&quot; of skin and liposuction of fatty deposits. These extra surgeries have inherent risks but are even more dangerous when coupled with the typical nutritional deficiencies that accompany convalescing gastric bypass patients.

== Surgeon accreditation ==
The American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery lists bariatric programs and surgeons in its &quot;Centers of Excellence&quot; network, while the American College of Surgeons accredits providers through its Bariatric Surgery Center Network. For listings of surgeons and centers in other countries, the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders lists medical associations by country.

<text>A biographical film or biopic () is a film that dramatizes the life of an actual person or group of people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character&#x27;s real name is used. They differ from docudrama films and historical drama films in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person&#x27;s life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.

==Context==

Biopic scholars include George F. Custen of the College of Staten Island and Dennis P. Bingham of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. Custen, in &quot;Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History&quot; (1992), regards the genre as having died with the Hollywood studio era, and in particular, Darryl F. Zanuck. On the other hand, Bingham&#x27;s 2010 study &quot;Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre&quot; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by Rick Altman in his study, &quot;Film/Genre&quot;. Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire&#x27;s &quot;Bio-Pics: a life in pictures&quot; (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list. Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, &quot;Taking Hollywood Back&quot; in the 2009 issue of &quot;Cinema Journal&quot;.

Roger Ebert defended &quot;The Hurricane&quot; and distortions in biographical films in general, stating &quot;those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... &quot;The Hurricane&quot; is not a documentary but a parable.&quot;

==Casting==
Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. Anthony Hopkins felt that he should not have played Richard Nixon in &quot;Nixon&quot; because of a lack of resemblance between the two. The casting of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in &quot;The Conqueror&quot; was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of Louis Gossett Jr., an African American actor, as Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in the 1983 TV miniseries &quot;Sadat&quot;. Also, some objected to the casting of Jennifer Lopez in &quot;Selena&quot; because she is a New York City native of Puerto Rican descent while Selena was Mexican American.

==Film representations==
Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses. Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Ben Kingsley, Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt, Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Eddie Redmayne, and Cillian Murphy all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics: Beatty and Dunaway as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), Kingsley as Mahatma Gandhi in &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), Depp as Ed Wood in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), Carrey as Andy Kaufman in &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999), Downey as Charlie Chaplin in &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992) and as Lewis Strauss in &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), Foxx as Ray Charles in &quot;Ray&quot; (2004), Thompson and Hanks as P. L. Travers and Walt Disney in &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; (2013), Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; (2014), and Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer in &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023).

 Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; was based on game show host Chuck Barris&#x27; widely debunked yet popular memoir of the same name, in which he claimed to be a CIA agent. &quot;Kafka&quot; incorporated both the life of author Franz Kafka and the surreal aspects of his fiction. The Errol Flynn film &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; tells the story of Custer but is highly romanticized. The Oliver Stone film &quot;The Doors&quot;, mainly about Jim Morrison, was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor Val Kilmer, look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison, and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.

In rare cases, sometimes called auto biopics, the subject of the film plays themself. Examples include Jackie Robinson in &quot;The Jackie Robinson Story&quot; (1950), Muhammad Ali in &quot;The Greatest&quot; (1977), Audie Murphy in &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; (1955), Patty Duke in &quot;Call Me Anna&quot; (1990), Bob Mathias in &quot;The Bob Mathias Story&quot; (1954), Arlo Guthrie in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; (1969), Fantasia in &quot;Life Is Not a Fairytale&quot; (2006), and Howard Stern in &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997).

In 2018, the musical biopic &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, based on the life of Queen singer Freddie Mercury, became the highest-grossing biopic in history at the time. In 2023, it was surpassed by &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb in World War II.

<doc id="782003" wikidata="Q65122124" url="?curid=782003" title="Buddhist deities">
<text>Buddhism includes a wide array of divine beings that are venerated in various ritual and popular contexts. Initially they included mainly Indian figures such as devas, asuras and yakshas, but later came to include other Asian spirits and local gods (like the Burmese &quot;nats&quot; and the Japanese &quot;kami&quot;). They range from enlightened Buddhas to regional spirits adopted by Buddhists or practiced on the margins of the religion. 

Buddhists later also came to incorporate aspects from the countries to which it spread. As such, it includes many aspects taken from other mythologies of those cultures.

==Buddhas==


A Buddha is a being who is fully awakened and has fully comprehended the Four Noble Truths. In the Theravada tradition, while there is a list of acknowledged past Buddhas, the historical Buddha Sakyamuni is the only Buddha of our current era and is generally not seen as accessible or as existing in some higher plane of existence. The Pali literature of the Theravāda tradition includes tales of twenty-nine Buddhas, which are Sakyamuni and the twenty-eight Buddhas who preceded him.

Mahayana Buddhists venerate numerous Buddhas, more so than the Theravada tradition, including Maitreya and Amitābha, who are seen as beings of great wisdom and power who preside over pure lands that one can travel to after death. Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions also recognize five primary Buddhas: 

* Vairocana (&quot;the Illuminator&quot;), a key figure in the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot;. He is the central Buddha in Huayan Buddhism, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, and Shingon. His pure land is known as the Padmagarbhalokadhātu (the lotus treasury world) and also as &quot;Densely Arrayed Akaniṣṭha&quot; (&quot;Ghanavyūhakaniṣṭha&quot;).
* Akshobhya (&quot;the Imperturbable&quot;), his buddha-field is Abhirati (lit. &quot;The Joyous&quot;).
* Amitābha (Amida Buddha, &quot;Infinite Light&quot;), the principal Buddha of Pure Land Buddhism. His buddha field is called Sukhāvatī (&quot;Blissful&quot;).
* Amoghasiddhi (&quot;Infallible Success&quot;)
* Ratnasambhava (&quot;Jewel Born&quot;)

Each is associated with a different consort, direction, aggregate (or aspect of the personality), emotion, element, color, symbol, and mount. In later, especially tantric sources, each male Buddha is associated with a specific female Buddha (though their names and attributes vary across the various Buddhist sources). Here is one common list of the five female Buddhas (also called prajñās, or vidyas): 

* Ākāśadhātvīśvarī (&quot;The Sovereign Lady of the Sphere of Infinite Space&quot;), the prajñā of Vairocana
* Locanā, the prajñā of Akṣobhya
* Māmakī (&quot;Mine-maker&quot;), the prajñā of Ratnasambhava
* Paṇḍāravāsinī (&quot;White Robed One&quot;), the prajñā of Amitabha
* Tārā (&#x27;Star&quot;), sometimes associated with Amoghasiddhi, sometimes Amitabha 

In Tibetan Buddhism, several female Buddhas are also recognized, such as Tara, the most popular female Buddha in Tibetan Buddhism, who comes in many forms and colors. Other female Buddha figures include Vajrayogini, Nairatmya, and Kurukullā.

Other Buddhas besides these five include Bhaisajyaguru (the Buddha of medicine) and Nageshvara Raja (the king of the Nāgas). 

There is also the idea of the Adi-Buddha, the &quot;first Buddha&quot; to attain Buddhahood. Variously named as Vajradhara, Samantabhadra, Shiva, and Mahavairocana, the first Buddha is also associated with the concept of Dharmakaya and the Ground of all phenomena.

Some historical figures are also seen as Buddhas, such as the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (sometimes called the second Buddha) and the figure of Padmasambhava.

==Bodhisattvas==

In Theravada Buddhism, &quot;bodhisatta&quot; is a term used mainly for Sakyamuni Buddha before his awakening. It is also commonly believed that the future Buddha, Maitreya (Pali: Metteya) currently resides in Tushita Heaven, and this figure is one of the few bodhisattvas who have a prominent place in Theravada.

In Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is any being that has aroused bodhicitta (mind of awakening) and is thus working towards full Buddhahood. Bodhisattvas who are seen as powerful and highly advanced are highly venerated in this tradition. 

In India, a list known as the &quot;Eight Close Sons&quot; (Skt. &quot;aṣṭa utaputra&quot;) became the main set of bodhisattvas of Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s entourage, they are:

* Mañjuśrī (&quot;Gentle Glory&quot;) Kumarabhuta (&quot;Young Prince&quot;), the main bodhisattva of wisdom
* Avalokiteśvara (&quot;Lord who gazes down at the world&quot;), the savior bodhisattva of great compassion
* Vajrapāṇi (&quot;Vajra in hand&quot;), the bodhisattva of protection, the protector of the Buddha (in East Asian sources, this slot is taken by Mahāsthāmaprāpta, though Vajrapāṇi is also found in these traditions)
* Maitreya (&quot;Friendly One&quot;), will become the Buddha of our world in the future
* Kṣitigarbha (&quot;Earth Source&quot;), known as the savior of beings from hell
* Ākāśagarbha (&quot;Space Source&quot;) also known as Gaganagañja, associated with the space element (&quot;ākāśa&quot;).
* Sarvanivāraṇaviṣkambhin (&quot;He who blocks the hindrances&quot;)
* Samantabhadra (&quot;Universal Worthy&quot;, or &quot;All Good&quot;), associated with vows
In Tibetan Buddhism, a Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, the major bodhisattvas are these &quot;eight great bodhisattvas&quot;. 

The bodhisattva Prajñāpāramitā-devi is a female personification of the perfection of wisdom and the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sutras&quot;. She became an important figure, widely depicted in Indian Buddhist art. She is the main female bodhisattva in Indian sources. Other Mahayana sutras also depict female bodhisattvas, such as &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar of Śrīmālādevī&quot;. 

Other male bodhisattvas appearing in Indian sources include Candraprabha, Suryaprabha, Bhaiṣajyasamudgata, Bhaiṣajyarāja, Akṣayamati, and Vajrasattva. There are also other female bodhisattvas like Tara, Ushnishavijaya, Vasudhara and Cundi. 

In the East Asian Buddhist traditions, which are mainly Mahayana, major bodhisattvas include many of the above: Guānyīn (Japanese: Kannon), Maitreya (Chinese: &quot;Mílè,&quot; Jp: &quot;Miroku&quot;), Samantabhadra (Ch: &quot;Pǔxián,&quot; Jp: &quot;Fugen&quot;), Manjushri (&quot;Wénshū&quot;), Ksitigarbha (Ch: Jìzàng Jp: Jizō), and Akasagarbha. The most popular bodhisattva in the East Asian pantheon is surely Guānyīn (the East Asian form of the Indian Avalokitesvara) who is depicted as female in East Asia, rather than as the Indian male Avalokitesvara. Guanyin is also believed by Buddhists to take on numerous manifestations, among which are several other bodhisattvas such as Cundi and Cintamanicakra. 

In addition, Buddhist traditions in different countries have also absorbed native deities into their localized Buddhist pantheon, sometimes as Bodhisattvas. Some examples are Guan Yu in Chinese Buddhism, who is venerated as Sangharama Bodhisattva (Chinese: 伽藍菩薩; Pinyin: &quot;Qiélán Púsà&quot;) as well as a deity, and Hachiman in Japanese Buddhism, who is venerated as the Bodhisattva Hachiman (Japanese: 八幡大菩薩; Rōmaji: &quot;Hachiman Daibosatsu&quot;).

Certain historical figures have been considered to be bodhisattvas, like Nagarjuna. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider reborn tulkus such as the Dalai Lamas and the Karmapas to be emanations of bodhisattvas. East Asian Buddhist traditions may venerate certain historical figures as bodhisattvas, such as Kukai in the Shingon school.

== Protector deities ==
In Buddhism, there is a class of deities whose main role is to act as guardians, protectors or general removers of evil. Some of these are unique to Buddhism and others are Indian deities that Buddhism shares with Hinduism. 

In Mahayana Buddhism there are numerous &quot;dharma protectors&quot; (S. dharmapāla, T. chos skyong; C. fahu 法護), powerful beings who are defenders of Buddhism and protectors of Buddhists against evil or harm. There are two main types of protectors, mundane worldly protectors (who may be devas or spirits) and supramundane awakened protectors, bodhisattvas or buddhas who appear in a specific form to defend the Dharma. The former includes numerous devas such Brahmā and Indra, as well as local spirits and gods that have been adopted by Buddhism. The latter type include popular wrathful deities like: Yamantaka, Ekajaṭī, Mahākāla, Palden Lhamo, and Hayagrīva.

=== Guardians of the world ===

The four &quot;guardians of the world&quot; (lokapāla), also known as the Four Heavenly Kings (&quot;Cāturmahārāja&quot;), are four deities (devas) who protect the four directions of the Sahā world (our world). Each guardian rules over a specific direction and also a class of non-human beings. These guardian deities are found in the earliest Buddhist sources and are shared by Mahayana and Theravada. The four guardians are:

*Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Sanskrit; Pali: Dhataraṭṭha) - Guardian of the East. Leader of the gandharvas and piśācas.
*Virūḍhaka (P: Virūḷhaka) - Guardian of the South. Leader of the kumbhāṇḍas and pretas.
*Virūpākṣa (P: Virūpakkha) - Guardian of the West. Leader of the nāgas and pūtanas.
*Vaiśravaṇa (P: Vessavaṇa) - Guardian of the North. Leader of the yakṣas and rākṣasas.

=== Wisdom King ===
The Wisdom Kings (Sanskrit: Vidyārāja) are beings that are venerated in East Asian Buddhism and in Vajrayana Buddhism. They are often depicted with an aggressive or fierce appearance which symbolizes their power to get rid of negative forces. They are thus often seen as an expression of the Buddha&#x27;s compassion.

In East Asian Buddhism, The Five Wisdom Kings are often seen as emanations of the Buddhas. These five are:
*Vajrayakṣa
*Acala
*Trailokyavijaya
*Kuṇḍali
*Yamantaka
Other important Wisdom Kings include

*Ucchuṣma 
*Hayagriva
*Āṭavaka
*Rāgarāja
*Aparajita
*Mahachakra
*Padanaksipa

=== Five Protector Goddesses ===
The Pañcarakṣā (&quot;Five Protectors&quot;) are five protector goddesses which are important in Mahayana Buddhism, the term also refers to their &quot;dhāraṇīs&quot;.

These five protective &quot;dhāraṇī-goddesses&quot; are:

* Mahāpratisarā (known for protection against defilements, disease, and evils),
* Mahāsahasrapramardinī (for protection against evil spirits),
* Mahāmāyūrī or vidyārājñī (for protection against snake-poison),
* Mahāśītavatī (for protection against &#x27;cruel&#x27; planets, cruel animals, and poisonous insects), and
* Mahārakṣā mantrānusāriṇī (for protection against diseases).

=== Mundane Dharmapalas ===


In Chinese Buddhism, there is a list of Twenty-Four Protective Deities (Chinese: 二十四諸天; pinyin: &quot;Èrshísì Zhūtiān&quot;). These are mostly mundane dharmapalas:

# Maheśvara (Shiva)

# Lakshmi
# Sarasvati
# Vaiśravaṇa
# Virūḍhaka
# Dhṛtarāṣṭra

==Devas==


The term &quot;deva&quot; (Sanskrit; Pāli: deva; Tibetan: &quot;lha&quot;; Chinese: &quot;tian&quot; 天; Japanese: &quot;ten&quot;; Korean: &quot;cheon&quot;) literally means &quot;radiant one&quot; or &quot;shining one&quot; and is commonly translated as &quot;divinity,&quot; &quot;heavenly being,&quot; or &quot;god.&quot; Devas are one of the five (or six, in some traditions) realms of rebirth (&quot;gati&quot;) within the cycle of existence (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;). The word &quot;deva&quot; originates from the Sanskrit root √&quot;div&quot;, meaning &quot;to shine,&quot; and shares an etymological connection with the English word &quot;divinity.&quot; Rebirth as a deva is considered a favorable outcome resulting from virtuous deeds (&quot;karman&quot;) performed in previous lifetimes. While the heavenly realms of devas are regarded as auspicious, they are impermanent and remain part of the cyclic existence of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, rather than being eternal heavens. Devas are not all necessarily wise or on the Buddhist path and hence not objects of refuge. They have very long lives which have much less suffering than humans, but are not immortal or immune from suffering. Some devas have no physical form and exist in the formless realms. None of them are creator gods, and they are neither omniscient nor omnipotent. 

Buddhist cosmology identifies 27 (alternatively 26 or 28) categories of devas, classified based on their dwelling places (&quot;devaloka&quot;) within the three realms of existence (&quot;trailokya&quot;): the sensuous realm (&quot;kāmadhātu&quot;), the material or form realm (&quot;rūpadhātu&quot;), and the formless or immaterial realm (&quot;ārūpyadhātu&quot;). Devas are apparitional beings, appearing fully developed at birth. In the sensuous realm, they retain physical bodies and consume food, while those in higher realms subsist on subtler forms of nourishment, such as sensory contact or mental contemplation. Their existence, while pleasurable, remains impermanent, as they are bound by &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. Upon rebirth, devas are often aware of their past lives and the virtuous deeds that led to their celestial existence. 

Some of the most commonly discussed types of devas in Buddhist scriptures include: the Brahma devas, Trāyastriṃśa devas, gandharvas (celestial musicians), and the Tuṣita devas. 

Various Indian devas were part of Indian Buddhism from an early period. Examples include Śakra (known as &quot;lord of the devas&quot;, the Buddhist Indra) who rules over the devas of the &quot;Heaven of the Thirty Three&quot; (Trayatrimsa), the four Lokapalas (&quot;guardians of the world&quot;), and goddesses like Lakshmi and Hariti. 

With the spread of Buddhism out of India, different cultures also integrated or syncretized local deities into their pantheon of devas. For example, Chinese Buddhism venerates the Twenty-Four Protective Devas, which include both originally Indian deities, such as Mahesvara (Shiva), Sakra (Indra), Brahma, Sarasvati, Laksmi, Marici and Hariti, as well as a few deities integrated from Taoism, such as the Emperor Zi Wei and Leigong. Guan Yu, who is regarded as a god of war in Taoism, is also regarded as both a bodhisattva and a deva. 

In Japanese Buddhism, Shinto gods were also syncretized into the pantheon under the honji suijaku theory by being conflated with the Indian deities imported from Buddhism, such as Ugajin and Ōkuninushi.

== Yidam ==


The yidam, or ishta-devata, is a personal meditation deity. The Sanskrit word &#x27; or &#x27; is defined by V. S. Apte as &quot;a favorite god, one&#x27;s tutelary deity.&quot; Though this term is used in many popular books on Buddhist Tantra, the term &quot;işţadevatā&quot; has not been attested in any Buddhist tantric text in Sanskrit. The unrelated Tibetan version of the term, possibly of entirely native origin, is &quot;yi-dam&quot; is said to be a contraction of Tib. &quot;yid-kyi-dam-tshig&quot;, meaning &quot;samaya of mind&quot;- in other words, the state of being indestructibly bonded with the inherently pure and liberated nature of mind.

The ishta-devata of Hinduism is an aspect of God for personal worship. In Buddhism, a yidam is a manifestation of enlightenment and may take the form of Sambhogakāya Buddhas, tantric deities such as Dakinis, bodhisattvas, Dharma protectors (Dharmapalas) or other historical figures such as past gurus or religious leaders.

===Wrathful deities===
In the Buddhist Tantras, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas often manifest in unusual and fierce forms, which are used in tantra as yidams or meditation deities. While some of these deities have a hideous and fierce appearance, they are not personifications of evil or demonic forces. The ferocious appearance of these deities is used to instill fear in evil spirits which threaten the Dharma.

==Other beings==

Throughout the history of Buddhism, Buddhists have also venerated and relied on numerous other supranormal beings or spirits. 

One important class of beings are the yakṣas&quot;,&quot; nature-spirits, usually benevolent, who are caretakers of the natural treasures hidden in the earth and tree roots. Having been worshiped in India since before the Vedic period, Buddhists in India venerated these deities as local protector spirits. One important Indian yakṣa was Kubera, the spirit of wealth.

Another important class of beings are the nāgas, a serpentine race of beings, often associated with protecting bodies of water. These beings are also associated with the Mahayana sutras and their protection.

In Burma there exists the popular worship of nature spirits called &quot;nats&quot; which are worshiped alongside of Buddhism.

In Japan, Buddhists have traditionally venerated the local kami deities.

<text>Richard Halleck Brodhead (born April 17, 1947) is an American scholar of 19th-century American literature. He is a former dean of Yale College, and served as the 9th president of Duke University in North Carolina, from 2004 to 2017.

==Early life and education==
Brodhead was born April 17, 1947, in Dayton, Ohio. His family moved to Fairfield, Connecticut when he was six years old, where he attended public schools. He attended Phillips Academy, where his high school classmates included Dick Wolf and George W. Bush. He attended Yale University, where, during his senior year, he was tapped for membership in the secret society Manuscript and as a member of the Elizabethan Club. He received a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in 1968, a Master of Philosophy in 1970, and continued at Yale for graduate school, earning a Ph.D. in English in 1972. He met his wife, Cynthia Degnan, while both were graduate students at Yale.

==Yale College==
After receiving his Ph.D. in 1972, Brodhead was appointed an assistant professor of English at Yale. In 1980, he received tenure and was named director of undergraduate studies in English. By 1985, he had been made a full professor, then was named chair of the English department in 1987 as Bird White Housum Professor of English in 1990, and the A. Giamatti Professor of English in 1995. He was appointed Dean of Yale College in 1993, overseeing faculty appointments and undergraduates until 2004. Yale President Richard C. Levin formed a committee in 2001 on Yale College education to conduct a major curricular review of its undergraduate program, appointing Brodhead as its chairman.

An expert in 19th-century American literature, Brodhead has written or edited more than a dozen books on Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles W. Chesnutt, William Faulkner, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, Richard Wright and Eudora Welty, among others, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. Brodhead won the DeVane Medal for outstanding teaching at Yale and spent eight summers teaching high school teachers at the Bread Loaf School of English at Middlebury, Vermont. He has lectured at universities in the United States, Europe, and Asia, and a collections of his leadership and liberal arts education writings were published by Yale in 2004, as &quot;The Good of this Place; Values and Challenges in Higher Education&quot;.

As dean and as a professor supervising graduate students, Brodhead was involved in the controversy surrounding efforts by graduate student-employees (GESO) to unionize. In 2003, he was added as a defendant, along with Richard Levin and Linda Lorimer, to a 2001 lawsuit by Yale professor James Van de Velde, claiming damage of reputation, after being named an official suspect in the murder of his student, Suzanne Jovin; Brodhead had subsequently canceled his class, citing Van de Velde&#x27;s presence as a &quot;major distraction.&quot; In 2007, a Connecticut judge permitted the reopening of Velde&#x27;s lawsuit against the New Haven Police Department and Yale, which subsequently also included senior university officials; the suit was settled in 2013.

==Duke University==

He left New Haven in 2004 to become President of Duke University, succeeding Nan Keohane. He was the first university president to live on campus since the 1960s, residing in the J. Deryl Hart House, the official presidential residence. Much of his leadership at Duke was focused on enriching the undergraduate experience of Duke students and expanding the university’s financial aid endowment to ensure that a Duke education is accessible to qualified students regardless of their family’s financial circumstances. He called for Duke to become an international center in addressing health care inequities through a major global health initiative involving faculty and schools across the university, and championed Duke’s efforts to bring the results of faculty and student research through a translational societal process. Brodhead was also active in Durham, promoting K-12 public education, several new community health clinics, neighborhood revitalization through the Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, and the future strategic direction of the Research Triangle Park Brodhead led the successful Financial Aid Initiative, which raised $308.5 million for need-based scholarships at Duke at its conclusion in 2008. His signature program was DukeEngage, which &quot;empowers students to address critical human needs through immersive service.

He made globalization a major strategic priority for the University. Under his leadership Duke established the Duke Global Health Institute, an interdisciplinary center that works to translate research findings to address health care inequities and improve the health of people around the world. He oversaw the creation of the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in partnership with the National University of Singapore. Duke Kunshan University, a new joint venture institution created by Duke University and Wuhan University in China, opened in August 2014, offering degree and non-degree academic programs for students from China and around the world. Brodhead led Duke Forward, a fundraising campaign, and the largest campaign in Duke’s history, raising $3.78 billion by 2017.

On April 28, 2016, Brodhead announced that he would end his tenure as Duke&#x27;s president on June 30, 2017, then take a one-year sabbatical before returning to academia as a writer and instructor. That November, the Duke University Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences visitors board established the annual undergraduate Brodhead Service Award in his name. His liberal arts education writings were published by Duke in 2017, as &quot;Speaking of Duke: Leading the 21st Century University&quot;. That May, the Duke University board of trustees chose to name the West Union building as the Richard H. Brodhead Center for Campus Life.

===Duke lacrosse case===
As president, Brodhead faced controversy during the Duke lacrosse case, after three members of the nationally ranked men&#x27;s lacrosse team were falsely accused of raping a stripper who had been hired to perform at an off-campus team party on March 13, 2006. Brodhead stated, on March 25, 2006, that &quot;our students must be presumed innocent until proven otherwise&quot; and that &quot;whatever they did is bad enough&quot;, while talking about sexual assault and racism in society. Brodhead canceled the remainder of the 2006 season, and Duke&#x27;s lacrosse coach Mike Pressler resigned.

On December 20, 2006, Brodhead stated that &quot;the DA&#x27;s case will be on trial just as much as our students will be&quot;. On January 3, 2007, Brodhead invited the accused students back to Duke as students in good standing and members of the lacrosse team while they still faced charges. On April 11, 2007, the N.C. Attorney General&#x27;s Office dropped all charges against the players, declared them innocent, and called them victims of a rogue prosecutor&#x27;s &quot;tragic rush to accuse&quot;. Later, Brodhead apologized in a public forum for the university&#x27;s &quot;failure to reach out&quot; in a &quot;time of extraordinary peril&quot;. He was among over 30 individuals named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in 2007 by the unindicted members of the lacrosse team, which was settled in 2008. In December 2024, the accuser, Crystal Mangum, admitted, during a December 11, 2024 podcast interview, that she &quot;made up a story that wasn&#x27;t true&quot; about the lacrosse players. 

== Boards ==
During his tenure at Duke, in 2011, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences was congressionally mandated to convene The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, appointing Brodhead co-chair. The Commission released its report, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, in June 2013.

He was appointed to the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, the board of trustees of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. He has served on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, and, since 2013, as a trustee of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. He has received honorary degrees from American institutions, as well as from Tsinghua University in Beijing.

<doc id="782012" wikidata="Q1983616" url="?curid=782012" title="Stickney (crater)">
<text>Stickney is the largest crater on Phobos, which is a satellite of Mars. It is in diameter, taking up a substantial proportion of the moon&#x27;s surface.

==Naming==
The crater is named after mathematician Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall, the wife of Phobos&#x27; discoverer Asaph Hall, whose support was credited by her husband as critical for his discovery of the moon. The crater was named in 1973, based on &quot;Mariner 9&quot; images, by an IAU nomenclature committee chaired by Carl Sagan.

==Formation==
There are two models for the age of Stickney, based on the differing possible dates at which Phobos began to orbit around Mars. If Phobos has been orbiting for 4.3 Ga (billion years) then Stickney formed 4.2 Ga ago, but if Phobos has only been orbiting for 3.5 Ga then it formed 2.6 Ga ago. The impact created a large amount of ejecta which escaped Phobos&#x27; gravity and entered into orbit around Mars for a period not exceeding 1000 years, some of this material then crashed back onto Phobos and created secondary impact craters. The majority of craters on Phobos that are smaller than 600 meters in diameter were caused by these secondary impacts.

==Physical features==
Grooves and crater chains appear to radiate from Stickney. One theory suggests that they were formed as a result of stresses from the impact that created the crater; if true this suggests that said impact nearly destroyed Phobos. There are however numerous other theories for how they were made, such as that they were formed by material ejected from impacts on Mars, that they were created by tidal forces exerted by Mars, or that they were created by boulders rolling along Phobos&#x27; surface following the Stickney impact.

Regardless of the causes of these grooves, the impact of the object which created Stickney was large enough to have potentially destroyed Phobos; a 2016 study by Syal et al. found that the high porosity of the moon was critical in preventing it from being destroyed during the collision. It is possible that the area underneath Stickney is much denser and less porous than the rest of Phobos, though models of the moon&#x27;s interior vary on this.

Stickney has a noticeable lineated texture on its interior walls, caused by landslides from materials falling into the crater. There is a noticeable blue spectral coloration on the south-western edge of the crater, which is theorized to be a relatively thin layer of rock. Said coloration was likely caused by a combination of material from Stickney itself and from the smaller crater of Limtoc.

<doc id="782023" wikidata="Q273201" url="?curid=782023" title="Herbert Spencer Gasser">
<text>Herbert Spencer Gasser (July 5, 1888 – May 11, 1963) was an American physiologist, and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for his work with action potentials in nerve fibers while on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis, awarded jointly with Joseph Erlanger.

==Education==
Gasser was born in Platteville, Wisconsin, to Herman Gasser and Jane Elisabeth Griswold Gasser. His father was a physician from Dornbirn in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg; his mother was of New England Yankee and German Russian ancestry.

==Biography==
Gasser attended State Normal School in Platteville, then entered the University of Wisconsin in 1907. Finishing his undergraduate studies in zoology in only two years, he enrolled in the university&#x27;s medical school in 1909, studying physiology under Joseph Erlanger, and pharmacology under Arthur S. Loevenhart. While still a student, he was named an instructor in pharmacology (1911). Since UW only provided preclinical medical instruction, Gasser transferred to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1913, where he received his medical degree in 1915. He then returned to UW as a pharmacology instructor.
In 1916 Gasser moved to the department of physiology at Washington University.

As the United States became involved in World War I and the armies began using chemical warfare, Gasser was urged to contribute his knowledge of human physiology to the subject. Accordingly, in the summer of 1918 he joined the Armed Forces Chemical Warfare Service in Washington D.C. After the Armistice he returned to Washington University, where he was made a professor of pharmacology in 1921.

During the years 1923–1925 Gasser studied in London, Paris and Munich under a Rockefeller Foundation grant, with the goal of improving the caliber of US medical education. After completing these studies he returned to Washington University.

In 1931 Gasser moved to New York City and became a professor of physiology at Cornell Medical College. After four years at that post, he was named the second director of the Rockefeller Institute, following the long tenure of Simon Flexner, who had founded the institute. He remained in that position until 1953. During his tenure there, he was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1936 Gasser and Erlanger gave a series of lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, summarizing their investigations into the actions of human nerve cells. This work led to their recognition in 1944, when they jointly received the Nobel Prize (Gasser used his prize money to fund further research into the subject).

After his retirement from the Rockefeller Institute in 1953, Gasser continued his research. He published over 100 scientific papers during his lifetime. He died in New York City on May 11, 1963.

<doc id="782026" wikidata="Q7444428" url="?curid=782026" title="Secretary of the United States Senate">
<text>The secretary of the Senate is an officer of the United States Senate. The secretary supervises an extensive array of offices and services to expedite the day-to-day operations of that body. The office is somewhat analogous to that of the clerk of the United States House of Representatives.

The first secretary was chosen on April 8, 1789, two days after the Senate achieved its first quorum for business at the beginning of the 1st United States Congress. From the start, the secretary was responsible for keeping the minutes and records of the Senate, including the records of senators&#x27; election, and for receiving and transmitting official messages to and from the president and the House of Representatives, as well as for purchasing supplies. As the Senate grew to become a major national institution, numerous other duties were assigned to the secretary, whose jurisdiction now encompasses clerks, curators, and computers; disbursement of payrolls; acquisition of stationery supplies; education of the Senate pages; and the maintenance of public records. Today, the secretary coordinates two of the largest technology initiatives in Senate history, both designed to bring state-of-the-art efficiency to management of legislative and financial information. The secretary&#x27;s responsibilities include both legislative and administrative functions.

By agreement of the two parties, the majority leader selects the secretary of the senate, and the election is merely ceremonial. The Senate Officers Clause of Article I, Section III states &quot;The Senate shall chuse their other Officers&quot;. The Oath or Affirmation Clause of Article VI provides that &quot;all ... Officers ... of the United States ... shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution&quot;, and pursuant to Article VI, the 1st United States Congress passed the Oath Administration Act (that remains in effect) which provides that &quot;the [S]ecretary of the Senate... shall... [take] the oath or affirmation [required by the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States]&quot;.

The current secretary (for the 119th United States Congress) is Jackie Barber.

== Legislative functions ==
The secretary regularly accompanies the chaplain into the Senate chamber for the opening of the day&#x27;s session and a seat beside the presiding officer is reserved for the secretary. The secretary examines and signs every act that has been passed by the Senate. In certain parliamentary circumstances, the secretary may also preside over the Senate. The most recent occurrence was on June 28, 2010, after Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who had been serving as President Pro Tempore died, and Vice President Joseph Biden was absent. On that occasion, Secretary of the Senate Nancy Erickson took the chair briefly until the Senate adopted a resolution to elect Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii as the new president pro tempore.

The first secretary took the minutes of Senate proceedings, a function continued today by the journal clerk. After the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; evolved into an official publication, the secretary came to supervise the Senate&#x27;s reporters of debates and preparation of the Daily Digest. Among other Senate floor staff who report to the secretary are the parliamentarian, bill clerk, and legislative clerk.

== Administrative functions ==
The first secretary purchased the quill pens, ink, and parchment needed by eighteenth-century senators. Modern secretaries of the Senate have responsibility for the Senate Stationery Room, a multimillion-dollar retail operation that keeps senators&#x27; offices supplied. From the beginning, the secretary served as the Senate&#x27;s disbursing officer, paying senators their original salary of six dollars a day plus travel expenses. As the Senate grew, a separate financial clerk was appointed under the secretary&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In recognition of the immediate and historical significance of Senate bills, resolutions, hearings, and reports, the secretary oversees the Office of Printing and Document Services, the Office of Senate Security (which maintains classified documents), the United States Senate Library, the Office of Senate Curator, and the Senate Historical Office. The secretary also maintains the Office of Interparliamentary Services to provide support for those interparliamentary conferences in which the Senate participates and to assist senators in international travel. Also under the secretary&#x27;s direction, the Office of Public Records collects and makes publicly available documents relating to campaign finance, financial ethics, foreign travel, and lobbying.

In 1789 the secretary was authorized to hire &quot;one principal clerk.&quot; This principal clerk, or chief clerk, for many years served primarily as a reading clerk on the Senate floor. But during the 1960s, in response to the secretary&#x27;s growing administrative duties, the position evolved into that of assistant secretary of the Senate, who oversees the administration of the Secretary&#x27;s Office, including computers and the secretary&#x27;s web site. The assistant secretary also performs the functions of the secretary in his or her absence. During the 1960s, under the leadership of Francis R. Valeo, staff positions under the secretary of the Senate were redefined from patronage to professional status, a trend continued by Valeo&#x27;s successors.

==Notable secretaries==
A position of great trust and responsibility, the Senate secretaryship has been held by a long line of distinguished individuals. Samuel Allyne Otis, the first secretary of the Senate, had previously been speaker of the Massachusetts legislature and a member of the Continental Congress. Otis held the post of secretary for twenty-five years, never missing a day that the Senate was in session. General Anson McCook of New York, a former House member and one of the &quot;Fighting McCooks&quot; of the Civil War, served as secretary, as well as a former Confederate general and Congressman, William R. Cox of North Carolina. In addition, two former U.S. senators, Charles Cutts of New Hampshire and Walter Lowrie of Pennsylvania, have later served as secretary. Other former House members who have held the post include Charles G. Bennett (NY). During the Ninety-ninth Congress (1985–1987), Jo-Anne Coe became the first woman to serve as secretary. 

It has not been unusual for secretaries of the Senate to have devoted their entire careers to the Senate. Several began as pages, including Edwin Halsey, who served throughout the dramatic New Deal years; Leslie Biffle, a close confidant of President Harry S. Truman; Carl Loeffler and J. Mark Trice, secretaries during the Eightieth and Eighty-third congresses; and Walter J. Stewart, secretary from 1987 to 1994.

<text>A president pro tempore or speaker pro tempore is a constitutionally recognized officer of a legislative body who presides over the chamber in the absence of the normal presiding officer. The phrase &quot;pro tempore&quot; is Latin &quot;for the time being&quot;.

In Argentina, a similar role is carried by the provisional president of the Argentine Senate in the absence of the vice president of Argentina. By the 1994 amendment to the 1853 Constitution, the vice president is designated as the senate president.

<doc id="782039" wikidata="Q2939083" url="?curid=782039" title="Carleton Watkins">
<text>Carleton E. Watkins (1829–1916) was an American photographer of the 19th century. Born in New York, he moved to California and quickly became interested in photography. He focused mainly on landscape photography, and Yosemite Valley was a favorite subject of his. His photographs of the valley significantly influenced the United States Congress&#x27; decision to preserve it as a National Park.

==Early life==

===Birth===
Carleton E. Watkins was born on November 11, 1829, the eldest of eight children. His parents were John and Julia Watkins, a carpenter and an innkeeper. Born in Oneonta, New York, he was a hunter and fisherman and was involved in the glee club and Presbyterian Church Choir. His true middle name is the subject of debate: some sources give it as Eugene while others give it as Emmons.

===San Francisco===

In 1851, Watkins and his Childhood friend Collis Huntington moved to San Francisco with hopes of finding gold. Although they did not succeed in this specific venture, both became successful. Watkins became known for his photography skills, and Huntington became one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; owners of the Central Pacific Railroad. This would later be helpful for Watkins.

==Career==

===Prior to photography===
During the first two years in San Francisco, Watkins did not work in photography. He originally worked for his friend Huntington, delivering supplies to mining operations. He did this before working as a store clerk at a George Murray&#x27;s Bookstore, near the studio of Robert H. Vance, a well-known Daguerreotypist. An employee of Vance&#x27;s unexpectedly left his job, and Watkins&#x27; agreeable personality led to his looking after the studio.

Before his work with Vance, Watkins knew nothing about photography. Vance showed him the basic elements of photography, planning to return and retake the portraits himself. However, when he came back, he found that Watkins had excelled at the art while he was away and his customers were satisfied.
===Early work===

By 1858, Watkins was ready to begin his own photography business. He did many commissions, including &quot;Illustrated California Magazine&quot; for James Mason Hutchings and the documentation of John and Jessie Fremont&#x27;s mining estate in Mariposa. He made Daguerreotype stereoviews (two nearly identical images of the same scene, viewed through a stereoscope to create an illusion of depth) at the New Almaden mercury mine near San Jose, California. These were used in a widely publicized court case, which furthered his reputation as a photographer.

===Oneonta Falls and Gorge===
The Oneonta Gorge is a scenic gorge located in the Columbia River Gorge area of Oregon. The Oneonta Falls and Gorge were first photographed by Watkins, who named them after his hometown.

===Yosemite===

In July 1861, Watkins made the decision that changed his career: he traveled to Yosemite. He brought his mammoth-plate camera (which used 18×22 inch glass plates) and his stereoscopic camera. The stereoscopic camera was used to give the subject depth, and the mammoth-plate camera was used to capture more detail. The photographer returned with thirty mammoth plates and one hundred stereoview negatives. These were some of the first photographs of Yosemite seen in the East. The photographs were shown in New York at Goupil Gallery in 1862, and an article in the New York Times stated, &quot;as specimens of the photographic art they are unequalled and reflect great credit upon the producer, Mr. Watkins. The views…are indescribably unique and beautiful. Nothing in the way of landscapes can be more impressive.&quot; In 1864, Watkins was hired to make photographs of Yosemite for the California State Geological Survey.

===Studios===

In 1867, Watkins opened his first public gallery, in addition to sending his photographs to the Universal Exposition in Paris, where he won a medal. This became his lavish Yosemite Art Gallery. He displayed over a hundred large Pacific Coast views in addition over a thousand images available through stereoscopes. Despite his success as an artist, he was not successful as a businessman and ended up losing his gallery to his creditor J.J. Cook.
===Taber and &quot;New Series&quot;===

Not only did Watkins lose his studio to Cook, but he also lost its contents. When Cook and photographer Isaiah Taber took over Yosemite Art Gallery, they began reproducing his work without giving him credit. The 19th century had no copyright laws covering photographs, and there was nothing Watkins could do to combat this plagiarism. Subsequently, he began recreating the images he lost, calling it the &quot;New Series.&quot;

==Personal life==
Watkins met Frances Sneed photographing in Virginia City, Nevada. They became romantically involved in 1878 and were married a year later, on Watkins&#x27; fiftieth birthday. The couple had two children: a daughter Julia in 1881, and a son Collis in 1883.

==Decline==

===Loss of sight===

Watkins began to lose his sight in the 1890s. His last commission was from Phoebe Hearst to photograph her Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. Watkins was unable to complete this job because of his failing sight and health. In 1895–96, his lack of work led to an inability to pay rent. The Watkins family lived in an abandoned railroad car for eighteen months.

===Loss of work===

Watkins kept the majority of his work in a studio on Market Street. This studio was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, with countless pictures, negatives and the majority of his stereo views. After this horrific loss, he retired to Capay Ranch.

===Napa State Hospital for the Insane===

Three years after Watkins retired to Capay Ranch, he was declared incompetent and put into the care of his daughter Julia. She cared for him for a year before committing him to the Napa State Hospital for the Insane in 1910, at which point Frances Watkins began referring to herself as a widow. Watkins died on June 23, 1916, and was buried in an unmarked grave on the hospital grounds.

==Legacy==
===Yosemite===

Watkins often photographed Yosemite and had a profound influence over the politicians debating its preservation as a national park. His photographs did more than just capture the national park; he created an icon. Half Dome, for example, did already exist, but Watkins&#x27; photographs brought it to people in a way that they could experience it. It became iconic through his photographs, became something people wanted to see in person. His images had a more concrete impact on Yosemite becoming a national park than just encouraging people to visit. It is said that Senator John Conness passed Watkins&#x27; photographs around Congress. His photography was also said to have influenced President Abraham Lincoln and was one of the major factors in Lincoln signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864, a bill that declared Yosemite Valley inviolable. The bill paved the way for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone National Park, and the U.S. National Park System in its entirety. One of Yosemite&#x27;s many mountains is named Mount Watkins in honor of Watkins&#x27; part in preserving Yosemite Valley.

Watkins was a &quot;master of the reflected image&quot; and photographed reflections, in bodies of water, of the Yosemite mountains.

===Environmentalism===

The 1864 bill signed by Lincoln is often seen as the beginning of environmentalism in American politics. In accordance with his influence in preserving Yosemite and the beginning of the National Parks system, Watkins is seen as an important part of that. His photographs captured nature in a way that caught the eye of Americans. He created sublime images of wilderness, pristine landscapes untouched by humans. These images established icons that furthered environmentalist ideals, helping to back claims about preservation.
===Grizzly Giant===

Watkins photographed one of the giant sequoia trees in California, the &quot;Grizzly Giant.&quot; His photo was created with one of his mammoth plates, which allowed him to photograph the entire tree, which had not been done before. Watkins, in addition to creating an image not seen before, was already very well known, and the image rapidly gained fame. Despite the fact that Watkins was attempting to preserve the trees, the way his photograph captured American audiences led to an increase in tourism in the area, which led to larger commercialization, which led to a diminishing of the giant sequoias.

<text>Alfred A. Hart (1816–1908) was a 19th-century American photographer for the Central Pacific Railroad. Hart was the official photographer of the western half of the first transcontinental railroad, for which he took 364 historic stereoviews of the railroad construction in the 1860s. Hart sold his negatives to Carleton Watkins, who continued to publish the CPRR stereoviews in the 1870s.

<text>, stylized as ARTSVISION, is a Japanese talent agency based in Yoyogi, Shibuya, Tokyo that employs many high-profile voice actors. It was founded in 1984 by Sakumi Matsuda.

==General information==
Arts Vision was founded by former Tokyo Actor&#x27;s Consumer&#x27;s Cooperative Society manager Sakumi Matsuda as an independent corporation in 1984.

The studio became famous in the 1990s during a boom time in the popularity of voice actors and voice-over acting. At its peak, the studio employed many of Japan&#x27;s most popular voice actors, who became known as &quot;Seiyū Idols.&quot; In 1997, however, many of those popular young performers moved to I&#x27;m Enterprise, a subsidiary agency also managed by Matsuda. Since that time few new performers have joined Arts Vision.

In 2003, Chihiro Suzuki and Masumi Asano moved from I&#x27;m Enterprise to Arts Vision, but in subsequent years the trend has been in the opposite direction, with artists such as Yukari Tamura and Natsuko Kuwatani moving from Arts Vision to I&#x27;m Enterprise.

<doc id="782055" wikidata="Q2203943" url="?curid=782055" title="1974 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1974 Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive and deadly hurricane season. In terms of overall activity, it was near average, with eleven named storms forming, of which four became hurricanes. Two of those four became major hurricanes, which are Category 3 ( sustained winds) or higher systems on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The season officially began on June 1 and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.

The first system, a tropical depression, developed over the Bay of Campeche on June 22 and dissipated by June 26. The most intense storm of the season was Hurricane Carmen, which struck the Yucatán Peninsula at Category 4 intensity and Louisiana at Category 3 intensity. Carmen caused about $162 million in damage, mostly in Louisiana, and 12 deaths. Also highly notable was Hurricane Fifi, the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since the 1900 Galveston hurricane, which dropped torrential rain in Central America, especially Honduras. The hurricane left more than $1.8 billion in damage and at least 8,210 fatalities. Fifi crossed over into the eastern Pacific and was renamed Orlene. In August, poor weather conditions produced by Tropical Storm Alma caused a plane crash in Venezuela, which killed 49 people. Alma caused two additional deaths in Trinidad. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this year resulted in at least 8,277 deaths and just under $2 billion in damage.

== Season summary ==

The hurricane season officially began on June 1, with the first tropical cyclone developing on June 22. A total of 20 tropical and subtropical cyclones formed, but just 11 of them intensified into nameable storm systems. This was about average compared to the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Four of these reached hurricane status, below the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, two storms reached major hurricane status; near the 1950–2000 average of 2.3. Collectively, the cyclones of this season caused at least 8,277 deaths and just under $2 billion in damage. The Atlantic hurricane season officially ended on November 30, with the final cyclone dissipating on November 12.

Similar to the previous two seasons, much of the tropics were dominated by extensive upper-level westerlies and colder than normal sea surface temperatures, producing unfavorable conditions, though to a lesser extent than in 1972 and 1973. Wind shear generated by the westerlies covered a smaller area, while sea surface temperatures in the tropics were generally above the threshold for tropical cyclogenesis. All named storms developed in regions with ocean temperatures exceeding .

Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with a tropical depression developing over the Bay of Campeche on June 22, followed by Subtropical Storm One over the Gulf of Mexico two days later. Three cyclones formed in July – two tropical depressions and a subtropical storm. August featured five systems, including Alma, Becky, Carmen, a subtropical storm, and a tropical depression. September was the most active month, with Dolly, Elaine, Hurricane Fifi, Gertrude, and three tropical depressions forming. Subtropical Storm Four and a tropical depression developed in October. The season&#x27;s final system, a tropical depression, formed on November 10 and dissipated by November 12.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61. ACE is a metric used to express the energy used by a tropical cyclone during its lifetime. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated at six-hour increments in which specific tropical and subtropical systems are either at or above sustained wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h), which is the threshold for tropical storm intensity.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Depression One ===

A low-pressure formed over the Bay of Campeche near Veracruz by June 1. Although a reconnaissance aircraft flight failed to locate a closed circulation early on June 22, surface observations in Mexico showed evidence of a circulation later that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;TD1/STS1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A tropical depression was estimated to have formed at 12:00 UTC on June 22 while situated just offshore Montepío, Veracruz. Initially, the depression moved northeastward and appeared well-organized. However, by the following day, convection associated with the depression began weakening after an upper low pressure trough intensified over the eastern United States. Convection flared over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but a second circulation had developed by June 24, with that system becoming Subtropical Storm One.

The depression, now moving slowly northeastward, redeveloped well-organized convection by June 25. However, shortly thereafter, the depression began to lose tropical characteristics due to interaction with atmospheric trough of low pressure. By June 26, the depression completed its extratropical transition over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The remnants of the depression accelerated to the northeast and moved across Florida, before moving along the East Coast of the United States and then dissipating over New England by June 30. The remnants of the depression brought mostly light rainfall to East Coast states, with a peak total of in Avon Park, Florida.
=== Subtropical Storm One ===
Tropical Depression One formed over the Bay of Campeche on June 22. As shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the depression diminished, convection flared over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on June 24, while a reconnaissance aircraft flight revealed that a closed circulation had developed over the south-central Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is estimated that a subtropical depression formed around 18:00 UTC on June 24. Early the following day, the subtropical depression intensified into a subtropical storm. Accelerating northeastward, the subtropical storm strengthened slightly further before making landfall near Clearwater, Florida, just after 06:00 UTC with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Although centered over Florida, the system intensified further, peaking with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) around 12:00 UTC on June 25. After exiting Florida, the cyclone quickly began extratropical later that day, with the remnants dissipating offshore North Carolina on June 27.

Portions of Florida experienced heavy precipitation, particularly the Tampa Bay Area. A peak rainfall total of was observed at the St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport. The storm brought flooding and erosion to parts of west Central Florida. Overall, approximately $24.8 million in damage occurred in Florida, with roughly half of that total incurred to beaches, bridges, drainage systems, roads, sewers, and utilities. Three deaths were reported in the state, all due to drowning.
=== Subtropical Storm Two ===

A convective area of cloudiness existed northeast of the Bahamas in mid July in response to a stationary frontal boundary. On July 15, satellite imagery suggested the presence of a weak circulation within the system. Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, a subtropical depression formed about northeast of the Bahamas. Moving northeastward, the cyclone slowly strengthened, becoming a subtropical storm at about 12:00 UTC on July 17. Late on the next day, the ship &quot;Export Adventurer&quot; observed winds of and a barometric pressure of . Based on these observations, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on July 18. By the next day, the cyclone began weakening. Around 00:00 UTC on July 20, the subtropical storm was absorbed a large extratropical low, which dissipated well east of Newfoundland several hours later.
=== Subtropical Storm Three ===

A frontal wave formed along a stationary front which ended from near Cape Hatteras northeastward. At 12:00 UTC on August 10, a subtropical storm developed between Bermuda and New England. The storm moved southeastward and then northeastward, before turning northward early on August 12. Drifting northward, the cyclone continued to intensify. Around 12:00 UTC on August 14, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , based on ship observations. Later that day, the cyclone curved east-northeastward and accelerated, while its circulation became increasingly ill-defined, resembling that of a front, near Sable Island at about 00:00 UTC on August 15. The remnants of the storm were last noted passing over Cape Race several hours later.
=== Tropical Storm Alma ===
A vigorous tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 9, developing into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on August 12 while located about 545 mi (875 km) east-southeast of Barbados. Steered rapidly west by an abnormally strong subtropical ridge, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alma by noon UTC the next day. Six hours later, Alma attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) in accordance with data from a reconnaissance aircraft. Early on August 14, Alma made landfall in Trinidad as a minimal tropical storm, becoming the southernmost-landfalling system on the island in 41 years. The system&#x27;s circulation entered Venezuela and interacted with mountainous terrain, where it dissipated by 12:00 UTC on August 15.

The storm produced a wind gust as high as on Trinidad at Savonetta. Alma left heavy damage in Trinidad, amounting to approximately $5 million, making it the most destructive cyclone of the 20th century on the island at that time. The storm damaged about 5,000 buildings, leaving roughly 500 people homeless. Additionally, the cyclone ruined about 17,750 acres (7,180 ha) of crop fields. Two fatalities occurred in Trinidad, including one person who was struck by flying debris. Alma&#x27;s heavy rainfall was responsible for a plane crash on Isla Margarita off the Venezuelan coast, killing the 49 people on board.
=== Tropical Depression Five ===

Around 12:00 UTC on August 24, a tropical depression developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Moving northwestward, the depression organized further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It was on the verge of attaining tropical storm status, but made landfall in Texas between Galveston and Freeport on August 26. The depression promptly dissipated.

The depression produced heavy rainfall in Texas, especially in the central parts of the state, with a peak total of in Burnet. A weak cold front, combined with the depression, brought flooding portions of Texas, especially Bell County. In Killeen and Harker Heights, more than 100 people fled their homes, as well as about 50 people from a mobile home park in Nolanville. Flooding damaged 47 homes, 37 mobile homes, and a number of cars. Damage in Bell County was estimated at $100,000. A pickup truck was swept off a low-water crossing at Fort Hood, drowning one occupant of the vehicle. The depression and its remnants also produced rainfall in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
=== Hurricane Becky ===

The National Hurricane Center first began monitoring an area of shower and thunderstorm activity northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 20. After five days, a circulation became visible on satellite imagery. The disturbance tracked northwest, and both ships observations and satellite imagery indicated the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on August 26; at the time, it was centered about 440 mi (710 km) south-southwest of Bermuda. Following designation, the depression curved north and then northeast as it rounded the western periphery of a ridge near the Azores. A light shear environment allowed it to intensify into Tropical Storm Becky by 06:00 UTC on August 28 and further into a hurricane by 18:00 UTC that day.

Around 12:00 UTC on August 29, Becky intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. Early on August 30, the system intensified into a Category 3, and by 12:00 UTC, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure , based on observations by a reconnaissance aircraft. Thereafter, Becky accelerated eastward and weaken weakening, falling to tropical storm intensity early on September 2. Later that day, the cyclone merged with a frontal zone northwest of the Azores. Although Becky never posed a threat to land, the storm crossed several major shipping routes.
=== Hurricane Carmen ===
A tropical wave crossed the western coast of Africa on August 23, organizing into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on August 29 about 365 mi (585 km) east of Guadeloupe. The newly designated cyclone was slow to intensify initially, with limited inflow and a majority of its circulation over the Greater Antilles. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Carmen early on August 30 and further into a hurricane by 12:00 UTC on August 31. Upon entering the western Caribbean Sea and amid a low wind shear environment, Carmen began a period of rapid intensification and attained peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) before moving ashore just north of Chetumal, Quintana Roo. Carmen weakened significantly over the Yucatán Peninsula, falling to tropical storm intensity by 00:00 UTC on September 3.

Carmen emerged into the Bay of Campeche late on September 3 and almost immediately executed a turn toward the north in response to falling pressures over the Southern United States. The cyclone steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, and a reconnaissance aircraft into the storm around 00:00 UTC on September 8 found that maximum winds had again increased to 150 mph (240 km/h). As Carmen approaching the coastline of Louisiana, radar indicated the presence of drier air entering the eastern semicircle of the circulation, and the cyclone moved ashore south of Morgan City with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). It turned northwest and then west-northwest after landfall and was last monitored as a tropical depression southeast of Waco, Texas, at 06:00 UTC on September 10.

Carmen brought heavy rainfall and a tornado to Puerto Rico, causing about $2 million in damage. Flooding in Jamaica resulted in three people drowning. In Mexico, the storm left hundreds of people homeless in Chetumal and damaged the homes and assets of more than 5,000 people. Four deaths and about $10 million in damage occurred in Mexico. In Louisiana, the storm produced sustained winds up to near Amelia. Along the coast, tides ranged from mean sea level, flooding homes with up to of water or sweeping away some of them into the swamp. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted minor damage to 1,015 homes, major damage to 722 homes, and complete destruction to 14 homes. Additionally, 697 mobile homes suffered major damage, while 41 other suffered destruction. However, much of the damage in the state was incurred to crops. Cotton, soybean, sugarcane, and rice crops collectively experienced about $116.8 million in damage. Overall, Carmen caused about $150 million in Louisiana and five deaths in the state. Freshwater and tidal flooding to a lesser degree occurred in the other Gulf Coast states.
=== Tropical Storm Dolly ===

An area of shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated underneath an upper-level low in the west Atlantic on August 30. The disturbance drifted west-northwest while steadily organizing, and a ship report around 18:00 UTC on September 2 indicated the formation of a tropical depression about 395 mi (635 km) south-southwest of Bermuda. Although the cyclone was embedded within a high wind shear environment, a reconnaissance mission into the storm the next afternoon found that it had intensified into Tropical Storm Dolly and attained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm recurved northeast ahead of an approaching trough and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 12:00 UTC on September 5 offshore the coastline of Nova Scotia.
=== Tropical Storm Elaine ===

A tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 30 and acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 4 roughly 715 mi (1,150 km) east of Guadeloupe. The newly-formed cyclone moved northwest for several days, maintaining its status as a tropical depression despite the absence of a closed low-level circulation in several reconnaissance missions. It eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Elaine east of North Carolina by 18:00 UTC on September 9, and with the aid of light upper-level winds, reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) early the next morning. Steered northeast by an approaching trough, Elaine interacted with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00:00 UTC on September 14 over the northern Atlantic.
=== Hurricane Fifi ===
A west-northwestward-moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression over the eastern Caribbean on September 14. Two days later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fifi just off the coast of Jamaica. The storm quickly intensified into a hurricane the following afternoon and attained its peak intensity on September 18 as a strong Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Maintaining hurricane intensity, Fifi brushed the northern coast of Honduras before making landfall in Belize with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) the following day. The storm quickly weakened after landfall, becoming a depression late on September 20. Continuing westward, the former hurricane began to interact with another system in the eastern Pacific. Early on September 22, Fifi re-attained tropical storm status before fully regenerating into a new tropical cyclone, Tropical Storm Orlene. The storm traveled in an arcuate path offshore Mexico and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in Sinaloa on September 24 and then quickly dissipating.

Fifi brought heavy rainfall to some of the Greater Antilles, especially Jamaica, which recorded precipitation totals exceeding . Parts of the capital city of Kingston were inundated with about . The storm caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage in Jamaica. While moving westward along the north coast of Honduras, Fifi lashed the country with strong winds and torrential, unrelenting rainfall. Many coastal cities were more than 80% destroyed, while at least 150,000 people were left homeless. The storm also completely destroyed the country&#x27;s banana crops. Fifi caused at least 8,000 deaths and nearly $1.8 billion in damage in Honduras. Other Central American countries were also affected, especially Guatemala. Torrential rainfall in Guatemala caused flooding which washed away or destroyed numerous bridges, roads, and homes. At least 200 people were killed, making Fifi the deadliest in the country in nearly 20 years. In El Salvador, heavy rainfall from the outer bands of the storm led to flooding which killed 10 people. Flooding in Nicaragua left hundreds of people homeless in some villages including in Jinotega, while communities such as La Conquista, Dulce Nombre, San Gregorio, and San Vicente were left isolated after roads washed away. In Belize, winds and rainfall combined to damage or demolish hundreds of homes. The country&#x27;s banana crop was completely destroyed.
=== Hurricane Gertrude ===

A disturbance developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone just off the western coast of Africa on September 22. The system moved west-northwest and steadily coalesced, organizing into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on September 27 about 985 mi (1,585 km) east-southeast of Barbados. The storm was slow to develop at first, intensifying into Tropical Storm Gertude by 18:00 UTC on September 28. However, a reconnaissance aircraft flight six hours later indicated Gertude had intensified into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), although its winds were transient and the storm featured an abnormally high surface pressure. After temporarily stalling, Gertude resumed its west-northwest motion while steadily weakening under the influence of strong upper-level winds. It passed through the southern Leeward Islands on October 2 and dissipated over the eastern Caribbean by 00:00 UTC on October 4.
=== Subtropical Storm Four ===
A low-pressure area developed near just north of eastern Cuba along the axis of a quasi-stationary cold front. The low became a subtropical depression on October 4. Shortly before striking Andros Island on October 6, the system strengthened into a subtropical storm. The storm made its closest approach to Florida early on October 7. Peaking with sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), the system veered northward and then northeastward, but nonetheless caused heavy rainfall and coastal flooding on land in Florida. While paralleling offshore North Carolina and South Carolina, the storm began to slowly weaken. By late on October 8, the subtropical cyclone merged with a cold front while well east of Cape Hatteras. The extratropical remnants persisted for several more hours, before dissipating on October 9.

Gale-force winds were observed by ships and land stations in the Bahamas. The storm and a stationary high pressure system over the Eastern United States resulted in strong winds and rough seas along the coast of Florida for several days, especially on October 6. Many coastal areas observed sustained winds of , with higher gusts. The storm also produced isolated pockets of heavy rainfall, including of precipitation in Boca Raton. Dozens of homes were flooded in Boca Raton and Pompano Beach. The heavy rainfall destroyed about 50% of winter vegetable crops in Broward County and about 25% of the eggplant crop and about 5%-10% of other crops in Palm Beach County. The storm also brought rainfall and abnormally high tides to Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Bermuda. Damage totaled at least $600,000.
=== Other systems ===
Tropical Depression Two developed just offshore the east coast of Africa on June 30. The depression moved westward for a few days, until dissipating on July 2.

Tropical Depression Three formed over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 13. Tracking west-southwestward, the depression curved northward on July 16. Late the following day, it made landfall near Caplen, Texas, and promptly dissipated.

Tropical Depression Eight formed offshore Guinea on September 2. The depression was long-lasting, and moved west-northwestward across the Atlantic for several days. Passing north of Puerto Rico on September 9, light to moderate rainfall totals were reported on the island and in the United States Virgin Islands, with a peak total of at a substation in Corozal, Puerto Rico. The depression dissipated near Inagua island in the Bahamas on September 11.

Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the western Atlantic on September 18. The depression remained weak and moved in a semi-circular path near Bermuda, before dissipating on September 20.

Tropical Depression Thirteen originated over the northwestern Caribbean on September 23. Moving northwestward, the storm grazed the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula on the following day and then entered the Gulf of Mexico. By September 25, the depression turned to the northeast. It weakened and dissipated just offshore the west coast of Florida near Cedar Key on September 27.

Tropical Depression Fifteen developed well northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 30. Moving quickly north-northeastward, the depression remained weak and then dissipated well to the southwest of the Azores on November 2.

Tropical Depression Sixteen formed north of Hispaniola on November 10. Moving slowly northward for a few days, the depression dissipated by November 12.

<doc id="782056" wikidata="Q923593" url="?curid=782056" title="The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter">
<text>is a (fictional prose narrative) containing elements of Japanese folklore. Written by an unknown author in the late 9th or early 10th century during the Heian period, it is considered the oldest surviving work in the form.

The story details the life of Kaguya-hime, a princess from the Moon who is discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant. After she grows, her beauty attracts five suitors seeking her hand in marriage, whom she turns away by challenging them each with an impossible task; she later attracts the affection of the Emperor of Japan. At the tale&#x27;s end, Kaguya-hime reveals her celestial origins and returns to the Moon. The story is also known as , after its protagonist.

==Background==
&quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; is considered the oldest surviving , though its exact date of composition is unknown. The oldest surviving manuscript is dated to 1592. A poem in the , a 10th-century work that describes life in the imperial court, invokes the tale in slight reference to a Moon-viewing party held at the palace in 909. A mention of smoke rising from Mount Fuji in &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; suggests that the volcano was still active at the time of its composition; the indicates that the mountain had stopped emitting smoke by 905. Other sources suggest the tale was written between 871 and 881.

The author of &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; is also unknown, and scholars have variously attributed the work to Minamoto no Shitagō (911–983), to the Abbot Henjō, to a member of the Inbe clan, to a member of a political faction opposed to Emperor Tenmu, and to the poet Ki no Haseo (842–912). It is also debated whether the tale was written by one person or a group of people, and whether it was written in , Japanese , or even Chinese.

==Narrative==

One day in the bamboo forest, an old bamboo cutter called comes across a mysterious, shining stalk of bamboo. Upon cutting it open, he is surprised to find an infant the size of his thumb inside. The old man and his wife, having no children of their own, decide to raise the infant as their own daughter, and name her . From that moment on, every time the man cuts a stalk of bamboo, he finds a small nugget of gold inside. The family soon grows rich, and within just three months, Kaguya-hime grows from an infant into a woman of ordinary size and extraordinary beauty. At first, the old man tries to keep news of Kaguya-hime away from outsiders, but as word of her beauty spreads, she attracts many suitors who seek her hand in marriage.

Among the suitors are five nobles: , , , , and . They eventually persuade the old man to have Kaguya-hime choose from among them. Uninterested, Kaguya-hime devises five impossible tasks, agreeing to marry the noble who can bring her the item specified for him: the stone begging bowl of the Buddha, a jeweled branch from the mythical island of Hōrai, a robe of fire rat skins, a colored jewel from a dragon&#x27;s neck, and a cowry shell born from a swallow.

Realizing the impossibility of his task, the first noble presents a fake stone bowl made from a blackened pot, but is exposed when Kaguya-hime notices that the bowl does not glow with holy light. The second noble presents a branch created by the country&#x27;s finest jewelers, but is revealed when a messenger of the craftsmen arrives at Kaguya-hime&#x27;s house to collect payment. The third noble is deceived by a merchant from China, who sells him a robe that burns when it is tested with fire. The fourth noble sets out to find a dragon at sea, but abandons his plans after encountering a storm. The fifth noble falls from a great height while reaching into a swallow&#x27;s nest.

After this, the Emperor of Japan comes to visit Kaguya-hime and, after falling in love, asks her hand in marriage. Although he is not subjected to an impossible trial, Kaguya-hime rejects his request for marriage as well, telling him that she is not from his country and therefore cannot go to the palace with him. She remains in contact with the Emperor, but continues to rebuff his proposals. Three years pass as they continue to communicate by letter.

That summer, whenever Kaguya-hime views the full moon, her eyes fill with tears. Though her adoptive parents grow very worried and question her, she refuses to tell them what is wrong. Her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic until she reveals that she is not of the Earth and that she must return to her people on the Moon. It is said that she was sent to the Earth, where she would inevitably form material attachment, as a punishment for some crime without further description. The gold was a stipend from the people of the Moon, sent to pay for Kaguya-hime&#x27;s upkeep.

As the day of her return approaches, the Emperor sends his guards to protect her from the Moon&#x27;s people, but when an embassy of heavenly beings descends upon the bamboo cutter&#x27;s house, the guards are blinded by a strange light. Kaguya-hime announces that, though she loves her many friends on Earth, she must return with the beings to her true home on the Moon. She writes sad notes of apology to her parents and to the Emperor, then gives her parents her own robe as a memento. She then takes a little of the elixir of immortality, attaches it to her letter to the Emperor, and gives it to the guard officer. As she hands it to him, a feather robe is placed on her shoulders, and all of her sadness and compassion for the people of the Earth are apparently forgotten. The entourage ascends into the sky, taking Kaguya-hime back to and leaving her earthly foster parents in tears.

The old couple become very sad and are soon put to bed sick. The officer returns to the Emperor with the items Kaguya-hime gave him as her last mortal act, and reports what happened. The Emperor reads her letter and is overcome with sadness, and asks his servants, &quot;Which mountain is the closest place to Heaven?&quot;; in response, one suggests the Great Mountain of Suruga Province. The Emperor then orders his men to take the letter to the summit of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the distant princess. They are also ordered to burn the elixir of immortality, as the Emperor does not wish to live for eternity without being able to see her.

Legend has it that the word for , became the name of the mountain, Mount Fuji. It is also said that the kanji for the mountain, which translate literally to , are derived from the Emperor&#x27;s army ascending the slopes to carry out his order. It is said that the smoke from the burning still rises to this day. (In the past, Mount Fuji was a much more active volcano and therefore produced more smoke.)

==Literary connections==

Elements of the tale were drawn from earlier stories. The protagonist Taketori no Okina appears in the earlier poetry collection (; poem #3791). In it, he meets a group of women and recites a poem to them. This indicates that there previously existed an image or tale revolving around a bamboo cutter and celestial or mystical women.

A similar retelling of the tale appears in the 12th century (volume 31, chapter 33), although the relationship between these texts is debated.
In 1957, (), a Chinese book of Tibetan tales, was published. In the early 1970s, Japanese literary researchers became aware that (), one of the tales in the book, had certain similarities with &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;.

Initially, many researchers believed to be related to &quot;Tale of Bamboo Cutter&quot;, although some were skeptical. In the 1980s, studies showed that the relationship between these stories was not as simple as initially thought. Okutsu provides an extensive review of the research, and notes that the book was intended to be for children, and as such, the editor took some liberties in adapting the tales. No other compilation of Tibetan tales contains the story. A researcher went to Sichuan and found that, apart from those who had already read , local researchers in Chengdu did not know the story. Several Tibetan sources in Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture did not know the story either. The philological consensus is that the author of the 1957 book purposefully copied &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;.

===Chang&#x27;e===
The Chinese legend of Chang&#x27;e can be traced to the second century BCE. According to the main telling of the legend, a named Chang&#x27;e came to Earth, thereby losing her immortality. To get it back, she stole the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, then fled to the Moon. The elements of immortality and flight are well-connected to the Daoist figure of the , as is the appearance of unusual figures in the mountains, but the Japanese tale includes many novel elements such as the bamboo cutter, the suitors, and the night abduction by floating creatures.

<text>Andrew Joseph Russell (March 20, 1829 – September 22, 1902) was an American photographer of the American Civil War and the Union Pacific Railroad. Russell photographed construction of the Union Pacific (UP) in 1868 and 1869.

==Early life==
Andrew J. Russell was born March 20, 1829, in Walpole, New Hampshire, as the son of Harriet (née Robinson) and Joseph Russell. He was raised in Nunda, New York. He took an early interest in painting and executed portraits and landscapes for family members and for local public figures.

==The Civil War==

During the first two years of the Civil War, Russell painted a diorama used to recruit soldiers for the Union Army. On August 22, 1862, he volunteered at Elmira, New York, mustering in the following month as Captain in Company F, 141st New York Volunteer Regiment. In February 1863, Russell took an interest in photography and paid civilian photographer Egbert Guy Fowx $300 to teach him the collodion wet-plate process. Fowx was a free-lance photographer who worked both for photographer Mathew Brady and for the United States Department of War.

Russell took his first photographs with a camera that he borrowed from Fowx and Colonel Herman Haupt. Haupt used Russell&#x27;s photographs to illustrate his reports. Haupt arranged to have Russell removed from his regiment on March 1, 1863, so that he could photograph for the United States Military Railroad and the Quartermaster Corps, until he mustered out in September 1865. Russell was the only military officer to photograph for the War Department during the American Civil War. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Confederate dead Behind the Stone Wall&quot; and another photograph stated before taken during the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863.

==Transcontinental Railroad==

Russell photographed the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad in Wyoming and Utah Territories during 1868, as their official photographer. He published these photographs in numerous forms, including as an album with 50 tipped in albumen prints and accompanying text: &quot;The Great West Illustrated in a Series of Photographic Views Across the Continent Taken Along the Line of the Union Pacific Railroad, West from Omaha, Nebraska. With an Annotated Table of Contents, Giving a Brief Description of Each View; Its Peculiarities, Characteristics, and Connection with the Different Points on the Road&quot;. His training as a painter provided the foundation for this series of views, which laid out the promise of the western landscape. While some of the images were truly romantic evocations of the West, others depicted construction sites or inhospitable landscapes; only the captions could remind viewers of the &quot;finest trout&quot; in the rivers or the &quot;luxurious growth of grass, wild rye, barley&quot; that might feed future inhabitants. This album, like others of its time, perpetuated the notion of Manifest Destiny, and the accompanying erasure of Native American presence; Native Americans do not appear in this album, which viewed the West as a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; upon with the country&#x27;s future could be built.

In 1869 he returned to Utah Territory to photograph the completion of the First transcontinental railroad, or &quot;golden spike&quot; on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. for this work, Russell used his single-view camera. Russell took five group portraits that day, at least two were &quot;...sent to New York as news pictures and arrived in time to be copied by engravers for the front page of the June 5 issue of Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper.&quot; These photographs and others have value today &quot;... principally as sources for the identification of persons.&quot; One photograph shows a rank of sixteen men under the title &quot;Engineers of U.P.R.R. at the Laying of Last Rail Promentory (sic).&quot; This famous photograph of the meeting of the rails, celebrated the joining of East and West, the reduction of a perilous 6 month wagon journey across the US to one that would take a mere 6 days, yet did not include any of the 11,000 Chinese laborers who had laid the tracks across the Sierra Nevada and the desert and into Utah.

This ceremony marked the end of Russell&#x27;s tenure as the official photographer of the Union Pacific railroad, a position he had taken after filling the same post for the Union Army during the Civil War. By 1869 he had in fact 
:&quot;&quot;...labored for nearly two years to produce over 200 full plate (10&quot; x 13&quot;) images and over 500 stereo cards. In general, Russell&#x27;s work partook in the company&#x27;s general effort to heroicize its own undertaking — an early form of advertising.&quot;&quot; 
Later that year he traveled to California to photograph locations on the Central Pacific Railroad and returned to New York City at the end of 1869.

==Later career==
In New York, Russell established a design studio and worked as a photojournalist for Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper through the early 1890s.

== Personal life ==
On October 17, 1850, Russell married Catherine Adelia Duryee, daughter of Lanah (née Conklin) and William Reynex Duryee. They had two daughters, Cora Phillips and Harriet M. Russell. Russell&#x27;s fragmented family life is evidenced by the fact that he does not appear with them on any census record, save in 1860. His wife and daughters made their home in Minnesota and Illinois. Russell lived on Logan Street in Brooklyn, New York, where he died, September 22, 1902.

<doc id="782069" wikidata="Q803711" url="?curid=782069" title="James Bay Project">
<text>The James Bay Project () refers to the construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations on the La Grande River in northwestern Quebec, Canada by state-owned utility Hydro-Québec, and the diversion of neighbouring rivers into the La Grande watershed. It is located between James Bay to the west and Labrador to the east, and its waters flow from the Laurentian Plateau of the Canadian Shield. The project is one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world. It has cost upwards of US$20 billion to build and has an installed generating capacity of 15.244 GW, at the cost of 7,000 square miles of Cree hunting lands. It has been built since 1974 by James Bay Energy () for Hydro-Québec.

Construction costs of the project&#x27;s first phase in ≈ 1971 amounted to $13.7 billion (1987 Canadian dollars). The eight power stations of the La Grande Complex generate an average of 9.5 GW, enough to meet the total demand of a small industrialized economy such as Belgium. The James Bay power stations represent almost half of Hydro-Québec&#x27;s total output and capacity.

The development of the James Bay Project was controversial. It led to an acrimonious conflict with the 5,000 Crees and 4,000 Inuit of Northern Quebec over land rights, lifestyle and environmental issues. A ruling against the Quebec government in 1973 forced the Robert Bourassa government to negotiate a far-reaching agreement, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, involving the Cree, the Inuit, the Quebec and Canadian governments, Hydro-Québec, the SEBJ, and later the Naskapi First Nations. In the 1990s, forceful opposition by the Crees and their environmental allies caused the cancellation of the Great Whale Project, a proposed 3,000 MW complex north of La Grande River.

In February 2002, the Bernard Landry government and the Grand Council of the Crees signed the &quot;Peace of the Braves&quot; () and the &quot;Boumhounan Agreement&quot;, establishing a new relationship between Quebec and the Crees and agreeing on environmental rules for the construction of three new power stations built between 2003 and 2011 — the Eastmain-1, Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle generating stations — and the diversion of the Rupert River.

== Geography ==

The James Bay region, also known as Jamésie, is a territory, bordered by the 49th and 55th parallels, James Bay on the western side and by the drainage divide with the Saint Lawrence River basin on the eastern side. The topography of the area consist of generally low relief areas and includes three parts: a coastal plain, a rolling plateau with a maximum elevation of and the Otish Mountains to the east of the territory, with peaks reaching .

The area is part of the Canadian Shield and is largely made up of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. Relief has been eroded by successive glaciations in the Pleistocene era, as recently as 6,000 years ago, leaving depositions of loose materials: moraines, clay, silt and sand and reshaped the hydrography of the territory.

The region&#x27;s climate is subarctic. Winters are long and last, on average, from October 22 to May 4. Summers are short and mild, with temperatures averaging in July, while dropping to in January. Annual precipitation averages , a third in snow. Highest monthly rainfall is registered in the summer and snow depths vary from in the winter. Precipitations are significantly lower than the annual average of recorded in Montreal. The area lies in the zone of discontinuous permafrost, whose depth is significantly reduced by the deep snow cover.

The natural seismicity of the area is low. An earthquake of magnitude 5 on the Richter magnitude scale occurred in 1941, its epicenter located approximately 150 km from the La Grande-3 generating station. However, episodes of induced seismicity occurred during the initial fill of reservoirs. In 1983, a magnitude 4 tremor was recorded upstream of LG-3&#x27;s main dam.

== History ==

=== Exploration ===
Between 1950 and 1959, a team led by H. M. Finlayson conducted water surveys of the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert Rivers—collectively known by the abbreviation NBR—on behalf of the Shawinigan Water &amp; Power Company, a large investor-owned utility based in Shawinigan, Quebec. Among options studied by Shawinigan&#x27;s engineers was the possible diversion of these rivers to the Saint-Maurice River watershed in order to increase output at the company&#x27;s 8 power stations.

With the nationalization of privately owned utilities in 1963, Hydro-Québec inherited the preliminary studies conducted by Finlayson and his team on the hydroelectric potential of James Bay rivers. However, other projects, such as the Manicouagan-Outardes project on the North Shore and the possibility of building a large power station at Churchill Falls in Labrador proved easier and less expensive and the Crown corporation devoted only minimal resources to the vast potential of northern rivers. In 1965, Hydro-Québec survey program included exploration of the territory and hydrographic surveys of areas between the 52nd and 55th parallel.

In 1967, the company stepped up the work on the La Grande and Eastmain rivers. Dozens, then hundreds of people were sent by helicopter and seaplanes in inaccessible areas of the taiga to perform surveys and geological studies to identify potential sites for hydropower development. Faced with budget concerns, Hydro-Québec did cut back exploration budgets between 1968 and 1970, but the company maintained planning and analysis work, since early data showed a large potential for development.

=== Early steps ===
On December 16, 1969, Liberal Backbencher Member of the National Assembly Robert Bourassa met with the president of Hydro-Québec, Roland Giroux over lunch at the parliamentary dining room in Quebec City. After the meeting Bourassa, who was about to launch a leadership bid for the position left vacant by the resignation of former Premier Jean Lesage, became convinced of the probability and suitability of the project and made the development of James Bay hydroelectricity a major plank of its leadership campaign. Elected as the party leader in January, Bourassa went on to win the general election on April 29, 1970, and his tenure as Premier of Quebec became closely linked to hydroelectric development in general and with the James Bay project in particular.

For Bourassa the development of James Bay project addressed two of his priorities. In &quot;Energy in the North&quot;, an essay published in 1985, Bourassa, an economist by profession, argued that &quot;Quebec&#x27;s economic development relies on the development of its natural resources&quot;. Moreover, Bourassa argued his 1969 estimates showed demand for electricity would outstrip supply by 11,000 MW by 1983, concurring with forecasts made at the time by Hydro-Quebec.

Six months after his election, Bourassa began working on the details of the scheme with his adviser, financier Paul Desrochers. The two men met secretly with Roland Giroux and Robert A. Boyd for an update in September 1970 and the next month he travelled to New York City in the midst of the October Crisis to negotiate financing for the project, estimated at the time to cost between $5 billion and $6 billion.

Bourassa introduced his plan to the provincial cabinet in March 1971 and recommended hiring the US engineering firm Bechtel to oversee the construction. Liberal strategists then chose to make the announcement before a partisan crowd assembled at Quebec&#x27;s Little Coliseum as part of the Liberal party gathering celebrating the first year of Bourassa&#x27;s term, on April 30, 1971. According to journalists witnessing the scene, Bourassa&#x27;s speech concluded on a scene of indescribable enthusiasm.

=== Nuclear lobby ===
The announcement quickly generated a public debate on the wisdom to engage the province on such a large-scale project. For several years, a lobby spearheaded by the Canadian government and its nuclear venture, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, promoted the adoption of nuclear energy in Quebec, as a way to &quot;share the benefits of Canada with our fellow francophone citizens&quot;, as Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson said. The lobby had its supporters within the ranks at Hydro-Québec, and has been vocal when the provincial government made the decision to invest in the Churchill Falls venture with Brinco. Several Parti Québécois spokesmen, including energy critic Guy Joron and economic adviser Jacques Parizeau voiced their opposition to the Bourassa scheme. In an interview with Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, the former economist and public servant who later became premier of Quebec commented: &quot;We don&#x27;t have to dam every single river just because they&#x27;re French Canadian and Catholic.&quot;

However, Bourassa himself and Hydro-Québec senior management — including President Roland Giroux and commissioners Yvon DeGuise and Robert Boyd — were firmly behind the large hydroelectric development to be built in northern Quebec. At the time Giroux, a financier, argued that large international investors &quot;are still wary about nuclear energy. If we bring them a good hydroelectric project, and James Bay is a good one, they&#x27;ll soon show where their preferences lie&quot;. As an engineer, Boyd expressed concerns at this early date about the uncertainty of nuclear energy. He recommended maintaining a certain expertise in the field but advocated delaying nuclear expansion as late as possible.

The Quebec premier received an unexpected backing when the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Alexei Kosygin visited Montreal in October 1971. Kosygin supported Bourassa&#x27;s project and expressed concerns regarding his country&#x27;s own nuclear power, explaining his country had to develop the technology because the USSR lacked suitable rivers to expand its own hydroelectric network of dams and power stations.

=== Options ===
Two options were considered when Bourassa unveiled his plan for the construction of several large hydroelectric power stations on the rivers flowing into James Bay, either on the Nottaway, Broadback, Rupert and Harricana Rivers in the south (NBR Project), or on the La Grande and Eastmain Rivers to the north. The northerly rivers were selected in May 1972, various studies conducted by engineering firms having concluded the La Grande option would be more cost effective, while having a lesser impact on forestry and would require less flooding, thus minimizing impacts on First Nations fishing and hunting. Another area of concern was the silty nature of the terrain in the NBR area, which would have complicated the damming.

The project, as described at the time, would involve the construction of four generating stations on the La Grande River and the diversion of the Eastmain and Caniapiscau rivers into the La Grande watershed. Responsibility for the project would be overseen by the Société d&#x27;énergie de la Baie-James, a newly created mixed corporation (public/private) controlled by Hydro-Québec, headed by Robert A. Boyd.
As environmental assessments were not then required under Quebec law, construction of the James Bay Road to the La Grande River was begun in 1971 and completed by October 1974 at a cost of about $400 million. In 1973 and 1974, a temporary winter ice road was used to bring in the heavy equipment required for the construction of the roadbed and some 13 major bridges spanning the many rivers of the region.

Construction had boomed in Montreal for Expo 67, leading to an inflated workforce. In the following years, the decreased demand for labor meant that times were tough for the construction industry in Montreal. As Bourassa had promised in the 1970 election that his government would create 100,000 jobs in the construction industry, there was much violent competition between various construction unions to have their workers engaged in the James Bay Project. Canadian historian Desmond Morton noted that there were 540 different incidents between the two main construction unions in Quebec on sites associated with the James Bay Project between 1970 and 1974, many of them &quot;very bloody&quot;. In the 1973 election, after the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ) union had donated generously to the &quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot;, Bourassa announced that only companies employing workers from the FTQ-affiliated &quot;Conseil des métiers de la construction&quot; headed by André &quot;Dédé&quot; Desjardins would work on the James Bay project. In March 1974, when one sub-contractor refused to fire two workers belonging to the rival CSN union, the FTQ workers destroyed the LG-2 site, causing $35 million in damage. On 21 March 1974, the workers on the LG-2 site rioted and used their bulldozers to destroy the site that they were working on while other workers set buildings afire.

In response to the riot at the LG-2 site, Bourassa created a royal commission headed by Judge Robert Cliche, the union official Guy Chevrette and a prominent Montreal labor lawyer Brian Mulroney to examine the question of freedom of expression within Quebec construction unions. The Cliche commission as it became known found widespread corruption within the construction unions as the columnist Peggy Curran wrote that the Cliche commission uncovered &quot;...tales of nepotism, bribery, sabotage, blackmail and intimidation; charges of union organizers with criminal records who gave lessons in how to break legs; thugs-for-hire who would happily beat up a rival union organizer’s teenager or strangle their dog.&quot; Desjardins was called before the Cliche commission several times starting in November 1974, where it was established that he was closely associated with the Montreal Mafia, and engaged in thuggish practices as president of the &quot;Conseil des métiers de la construction&quot; union.

Although the Aboriginal Crees had traditional hunting and trapping areas in the region, no seasonal or permanent roads existed at the time. Opposition to the project, however, was strong among the 5,000 Crees of James Bay, the 3,500 Inuit to the north and several environmental groups. They believed the government of Quebec was acting in violation of treaties and committing unlawful expropriation and destruction of traditional hunting and trapping lands. Furthermore, the Cree and Inuit had not been informed of the hydroelectric project until after construction of the access road had begun. The federal Indian affairs minister Jean Chrétien intervened on the side of the Cree and the Inuit, hiring lawyers to argue their case in the courts. Both Bourassa and the Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau were Liberals and federalists, but relations between the two were very strained at best as the French-Canadian nationalist Bourassa was a &quot;soft federalist&quot; who favored devolving the powers of the federal government down to the provinces while the Canadian nationalist Trudeau was a &quot;hard federalist&quot; who favored concentrating power in the hands of the federal government. Relations between Quebec City and Ottawa were brought to the breaking point in 1971 when Bourassa vetoed the Victoria charter for patriating the British North America Act to give Canada its own constitution on the grounds that if the British North American Act was going to be changed, then the federal government should cede more powers to the provinces. The willingness of the Trudeau government to intervene on the side of the Cree and Inuit against the Quebec government was at least in part caused by the feud between Bourassa and Trudeau.

In a speech championing the Cree, Chrétien said Bourassa &quot;could go to hell&quot;, charging that he did not have the right to build on or flood the land claimed by the Cree. In 1973, the federal government&#x27;s lawyers won a court injunction ordering the James Bay project stopped until a treaty could be signed with the Cree and Inuit, but an appeals court overturned the ruling days later. However, Bourassa agreed to negotiate with the First Nations as the federal government announced it was willing to take the matter to the Supreme Court. In later years, the Cree and Inuit were given a settlement of $150 million, negotiated by Cree chief Billy Diamond.

In November 1975, the governments of Canada and Quebec signed the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement with the Cree of the James Bay region and the Inuit of northern Quebec, affirming exclusive hunting and fishing rights to about 170,000 km2 of territory and about $250 million in financial compensation in return for the right to develop the hydroelectric resources of Northern Quebec. The planned La Grande-1 power station would be built about 50 km further away from the Cree village of Chisasibi than originally planned. The Agreement also provided for an extensive environmental follow-up of all aspects of the hydroelectric development on the La Grande and Eastmain rivers and the establishment of a joint environmental assessment process for any future hydroelectric project involving other rivers of Northern Quebec.

== The project ==

=== Phase I ===
The period of construction of the first phase of the project covered about 14 years. By 1986, the largest power stations and reservoirs on the La Grande River were mostly completed, including the Robert-Bourassa (originally named La Grande-2), La Grande-3 and La Grande-4 generating stations, with an installed capacity of 10,800 MW, and five reservoirs covering an area of 11,300 km2. The Eastmain and Caniapiscau river diversions each added about 800 m3/s of water to the La Grande River. The power plants of the first phase of the James Bay Project produce about 65 TWh of power each year, operating at about 60% of their maximum rated generating capacity.

During this first phase of construction, over of fill, 138,000 tons of steel, 550,000 tons of cement, and nearly 70,000 tons of explosives were used. Concurrent employment by the project reached 18,000. Of the 215 dikes and dams, many surpassed the height of skyscrapers, with one reaching 56 stories. The terraced diversion channel at Robert-Bourassa generating station was carved 30 m (one hundred feet) deep into the side of a mountain. Water tumbles from the reservoir to the river below at a height greater than that of Niagara Falls. A network of transmission lines was necessary to bring generated power to consumers in southern Quebec. The network contains several 735-kilovolt lines and one 450-kilovolt DC line directly linked to the U.S. power grid.

=== Phase II ===
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, construction of the second phase of the James Bay project centred on the construction of five secondary power plants on the La Grande River and its tributaries (La Grande-1, La Grande-2A, Laforge-1, Laforge-2 and Brisay), adding a further 5,200 MW of generating capacity by the end of 1996. Premier Bourassa estimated that this phase would create 40,000 construction job-years (equivalent to 4,000 jobs lasting 10 years). Three new reservoirs covering an area of 1,600 km2 were created, including the Laforge-1 Reservoir covering 1,288 km2. The generating plants of this second phase of the project produce about 18.9 TWh of power per year, operating at between 60% and 70% of their maximum rated generating capacity.

On March 13, 1989, a massive solar storm caused a failure of the La Grande complex, plunging most of Quebec into darkness for nine hours.

=== Great Whale River project ===
During the construction of the second phase of the James Bay Project, Hydro-Québec proposed an additional project on the Great Whale River (French: &quot;Grande rivière de la Baleine&quot;), just to the north of the La Grande River watershed. Opposition among the Cree was even more vocal this time than in the early 1970s. In 1990, Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come organized a canoe trip from Hudson Bay to the Hudson River, in Albany, New York, and this very effective public relations stunt brought international pressure to bear on the government of Quebec. The Cree had experienced considerable culture shock with the introduction of permanent transportation routes to the south and very few Cree were employed on the construction site. Poverty and social problems remained prevalent in the isolated Cree and Inuit villages of Northern Quebec, even in areas where there were no hydroelectric or mining activities.

By the 1980s, the natural ebb and flow of the La Grande, Eastmain and Caniapiscau rivers had been severely modified, notably delaying the formation of a solid ice cover near the Cree village of Chisasibi, and about 4% of the traditional hunting and trapping territories of the Cree had been lost to the rising waters of the reservoirs, including about 10% of the territories of the Cree village of Chisasibi. At the same time, new roads, snowmobiles and bush airlines facilitated access to distant hunting territories of the interior. While highly motivated, the Cree&#x27;s opposition to the Great Whale River Project was mainly ineffective until 1992 when the State of New York withdrew from a multibillion-dollar power purchasing agreement due to public outcry and a decrease in energy requirements. In 1994, the Government of Quebec and Hydro-Québec suspended the project indefinitely.

=== Rupert River diversion ===
In 2002, the Quebec government and the Grand Council of the Crees signed a landmark agreement, &quot;La Paix des Braves&quot; (literally &quot;The Peace of the Braves&quot;), ensuring the completion of the last phase of the original James Bay Project: construction of the Eastmain-1 generating station, with a capacity of 480 MW, and the Eastmain Reservoir with a surface area of about .

A subsequent agreement in April 2004 put an end to all litigation between the two parties and opened the way to a joint environmental assessment of the projected diversion of the Rupert River, to the south of the Eastmain River. The project entails the diversion of about 50% of the total water flow of the Rupert River (and 70% of the flow at the diversion point) towards the Eastmain Reservoir and into the La Grande Complex, and the construction of two additional generating stations: Eastmain-1A and Sarcelle, with a combined capacity of 888 MW. The Rupert diversion would generate a total of 8.5 TWh of electricity at the new and existing power stations.

Former Grand Chief of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) Matthew Mukash (elected in late 2005 and served until 2009) opposed the Rupert River diversion and favoured the construction of wind turbines.

== Environmental impacts ==
Although there was no environmental impact assessment legislation before the James Bay Project&#x27;s initial construction phase in the 1970s, a major environmental research program was conducted before Phase I began.

The environmental impacts of the James Bay Project largely stem from the creation of a complex chain reservoir through the integration of all the watersheds of the eastern shores of the Hudson Bay, from the southern tip of James Bay to Ungava Bay in the north. This has had the consequence of diverting the flow of water from four major rivers into a large body of water, ultimately changing the dynamics of the land, an environmental political phenomenon labelled by some critics as a &quot;first build, then paint green&quot; policy.

=== Mercury pollution ===
Two of these main diverted rivers are the Caniapiscau River and the Eastmain River into which the James Bay Project submerged about 11,000 km2 of boreal forest (taiga). Consequently, the flooded vegetation&#x27;s stored mercury (Hg) was released into the aquatic ecosystem, and due to the diversion of the water flow to contained reservoirs, the sudden abundance of mercury in the James Bay area in 1979 was unable to be dispersed and diluted as would have been the case in natural waters. Because the James Bay Cree (East Cree) live a mostly traditional lifestyle including a diet rich in fish and sea mammals, there is a possibility that the damming project has contributed to northern Quebec&#x27;s Cree having the highest measured methyl-mercury concentration of all Canadian First Nations. Because of the simultaneous mercury contamination in James Bay from other activities in the area, including paper milling, the direct effect of the project on mercury levels has been difficult to ascertain. From 1981 to 1982, a few years after the flooding of La Grande River, mercury levels in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) increased up to fourfold their pre-flooding levels, while those in northern pike (Esox lucius) rose up to sevenfold during the same period. In natural lakes, these concentrations are five to six times less than in the James Bay area. This rapid spike of mercury levels in two of the fish species used extensively by the area&#x27;s Cree is attributed to the processes of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Biaccumulation is the initial consequence of mercury pollution, as the toxin is first incorporated into the given ecosystem&#x27;s producers. In the James Bay area ecosystem, mercury being released from the decaying flooded trees would be incorporated in trace amounts in zooplankton. Benthic organisms (benthos), the whitefish&#x27;s primary prey, consume a great deal of zooplankton, causing the mercury concentration in a single organism to magnify due to accumulation of mercury and its inability to be excreted. In turn, whitefish, due to their greater size, consume large numbers of benthic invertebrates, thus incorporating the individual mercury accumulations of each organism and creating their own store of mercury. The effect is further exacerbated by humans consuming this built up store of mercury. The James Bay Mercury Agreement, signed in 1986 between the Grand Council of the Crees (of Québec), the Cree Regional Authority, the Cree Bands, the Government of Québec, Hydro-Québec and the Société d’énergie de la Baie James (James Bay Energy), aims &quot;to restore and strengthen Cree fisheries [...] but [...] also adequately take into account the health risks associated with human exposure to mercury.&quot;

=== Local climate changes ===
The establishment of reservoirs containing large amounts of standing water has the ability to produce local climate changes. Alteration of annual precipitation patterns, increased abundance of low stratus clouds and fog, and warmer autumns and cooler springs, leading to a delay in the beginning and end of the growing season, have all been observed in the vicinity of the project&#x27;s major reservoirs. The doubling of the freshwater input into James Bay during the winter decreases the salinity of the seawater, thereby increasing the freezing point of the bay. The resultant increased ice content at the northern section of the project in the winter has cooled warm air currents more than usual, bringing harsher Arctic weather, including strong winds and less precipitation, to south-central Quebec. The tree line at the southern edge of the development has shifted noticeably southward since the project&#x27;s construction.

=== Water flow modifications ===
Following construction of the project, the area&#x27;s water flow was substantially modified. In the James Bay area in general, the average monthly surface runoff rate in the winter increased by 52%, doubling the total freshwater input, while that of the summer months decreased by 6%. The James Bay area&#x27;s water flow is most affected by the hydroelectric project from January to April because rivers have their lowest runoff rates in the winter months when freezing occurs. Additionally, runoff rates in the damming system can be altered to meet power needs, which are highest in the winter and lowest in the summer, thereby more completely reversing the natural water flow cycle. As evidenced by the 500% increase in its winter runoff, the La Grande River is the pillar of the James Bay project&#x27;s hydroelectric capacity, with the runoff increasing from an average yearly amount of 1,700 m3/s to 3,400 m3/s, and from 500 m3/s to 5,000 m3/s in the winter. This immense harnessing of the area&#x27;s energy at La Grande was made possible by reducing the Eastmain River&#x27;s water flow at its mouth by 90% and by reducing that of the Caniaspiscau River&#x27;s by 45%, and then by diverting these rivers into La Grande. Not only does this alter the runoff amount of the Eastmain and the Caniaspiscau Rivers, but also their drainage location, since prior to having been directly merged with La Grande, these rivers’ drainage locations were separate from the La Grande River. The summer runoff rate of La Grande increased by 40%, making the average annual runoff rate 91% greater than its natural rate.

Because of the change in the runoff rates of James Bay, massively increasing in the winter months, and increasing considerably in the summer as well, there has been more extreme fluctuation in the water levels. This has killed many trees along the shoreline, which are not equipped with deep enough root systems and tolerance of prolonged exposure to seawater to withstand these fluctuations. As well, the increased riverbank erosion downstream of the dams has washed the flora’s habitat down the river. The result has been considerable decay (decomposition) of dead trees along the shoreline, consequently releasing stored mercury into the area&#x27;s terrestrial ecosystem through bioaccumulation in decomposers and detritovores and eventual biomagnification up the food web. This has left the area&#x27;s Cree susceptible to mercury poisoning from both land and sea. Any shoreline plants that could potentially provide vegetation growth to replace any of the lost wetland habitats in these zones of periodic fluctuations are destroyed.

=== Changes in migration routes ===
Other changes in the delicate balance of the James Bay ecosystem can be illustrated through the animal migration patterns, salmon spawning, and destruction of wildlife habitats. The significant loss of wetlands and the blocking of passageways to those wetlands that remain has inhibited salmon spawning and migration in the James Bay area. Additionally, diverting rivers towards the James Bay could cause changes in the geographical pattern of river water discharge into the sea.[36]

Caribou populations, which have been expanding since the 1950s, have adopted migration routes throughout much of the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula and have thus been increasingly abundant in the James Bay area, the valley of the Caniapiscau, and around George River (Quebec).[37] Variations in the water flow of the Caniapiscau River from 1981 to 1984, during the period when the Caniapiscau Reservoir was being filled, may have contributed to the death by drowning of 10,000 migratory woodland caribou in September 1984, representing about 1.5% of the herd at that time. On the other hand, the reduced flow of the Caniapiscau River and the Koksoak River has permanently reduced the risk of natural floods on the lower Caniapiscau during the period of caribou migrations, giving hunters greater access to caribou than ever before. About 30,000 caribou are killed each year by Inuit, Cree and American and European hunters.

Seasonal reversal in the flow of rivers can potentially rob the rich nutrients that thrive in various mudflats and coastal marshes, affecting millions of migratory birds such as waterfowl, Canada geese, and various inland birds that use the coastlines of both the James and Hudson Bays during their spring and fall migrations.[38]

== Social impact ==
The James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement provided considerable financial and administrative resources for the Cree and Inuit communities to deal with the environmental and social consequences of the project and provide for future economic development, such as the creation of the local airline Air Creebec. The James Bay Project also was an impetus for the forging of a collective identity among the Cree of Quebec and for the establishment of the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee). The Agreement notably provided for major institutional structures for local government, economic development, schools and health services, mostly under the control of the Grand Council of the Crees and the Kativik Regional Government, in Nunavik.

Yet, the social consequences of the hydroelectric project itself pale in comparison to the social impact of the Cree coming into direct contact with the society and economic forces of francophone Quebec. The greatest impact stems from the construction in the early 1970s of the James Bay Road (&quot;Route de la Baie James&quot;) from Matagami to the new town of Radisson, near the Robert-Bourassa generating station (La Grande-2), and on to the nearby Cree village of Chisasibi. During the main construction period of the late 1970s, Radisson housed a population several times greater than the Cree population of Chisasibi, although it currently has a population of about 500.

Nevertheless, the Cree communities have themselves continued the push to build additional roads from the James Bay Road westward to the Cree coastal villages of Wemindji, Eastmain and Waskaganish. These roads, opened between 1995 and 2001, have further facilitated access to hunting areas of the interior and encouraged commercial and social exchanges between the Cree villages and with southern Quebec. A separate road (&quot;Route du Nord&quot;) also links the James Bay Road to Chibougamau, via the Cree village of Nemaska. The building of these newer roads was largely the work of Cree construction companies.

The James Bay Road also opened the region to further mineral exploration and clear-cut logging in the southern James Bay area and substantially reduced the cost of transport. These activities have put further strains on the traditional hunting and trapping activities of the Cree in the southern James Bay region, notably the villages of Waskaganish and Nemaska. Such activities, however, only accounted for about half the economic activity of the Cree communities in 1970 and less than 20% by the late 1990s. Hunting and fishing in the Cree villages mostly involves young adults and older Cree with few professional qualifications. Such activities are furthermore sustained by an income replacement program financed by the government of Quebec that offers the equivalent of a modest annual salary for hunters and their families who live in the bush for at least several weeks of the year.

<doc id="782074" wikidata="Q624345" url="?curid=782074" title="DC Inside">
<text>DC Inside (), also known as DC, is a South Korean internet forum that was founded in 1999. It is a prominent online platform in the country, allowing users to engage in discussions on a diverse range of subjects with little moderation, such as entertainment, politics, hate, and personal interests. The forum features user-generated content, including written posts, images, and videos, which are contributed by its active user base. DC Inside has established itself as a significant hub for online discussion in South Korea. DC Inside has also been linked to a misogynistic controversy in the last few years, where it does not prevent users from making hate speech against women.

== Overview ==

Initially established as a community of interest dedicated to digital cameras and photography in October 1999, it soon expanded continuously by the propagation of additional image boards. The vestige lies on the name (short for Digital Camera), and the fact that the term &quot;gallery&quot; refers to each imageboard.

== History ==
The website was initially populated by early adopters of electronic devices, and was incorporated in 2000.

By 2006, it had 500 active boards, and Kim anticipated the count to multiply to over 1000 by the latter half of 2007. In 2009, it stopped providing information about digital cameras since it had transformed into a general imageboard website.

In 2013, it stopped using the remodeled version of Zeroboard, a popular Korean free-to-use script for bulletin board systems. Zeroboard was known to have security vulnerabilities and bandwidth issues, which many users expressed frustration about as early as 2006.

In 2015, its own Wiki was created. In 2016, a new update gave users the ability to request a new imageboard subject. These imageboards, called &quot;minor galleries&quot;, are separate from previous &quot;galleries&quot;.

== Galleries ==
The early galleries were for uploading user-created camera pictures, which led to a rule requiring an image be uploaded for each post. This rule is no longer in effect.

Gallery topics range from generic categories such as politics, science, wiki, sports and video games, to particular subjects such as those devoted to individual celebrities and K-pop stars. New galleries are created if the new topic is acknowledged and deemed appropriate by the site administrator.

=== Minor galleries ===
New &quot;minor galleries&quot; are created upon user request. The request message should explain the gallery topic, which should not be inappropriate, and should not overlap with existing galleries. Highly active minor galleries can be promoted into main galleries by administrators. In this case, administrators obtain the right to manage the galleries.

=== Administrators and managers ===
Galleries are controlled by site administrators, while minor galleries are controlled by dedicated user accounts, called managers, or more frequently &quot;ju-ttag&quot; (), due to the fact that their usernames come with an orange badge. Manager roles are first assigned to the user who requested creation of that gallery, and the role can be handed over to other users. Sub-managers can be appointed by managers and get a blue badge, leading them to be called &quot;pa-ttag&quot; ().

=== Hit gallery ===
Site administrators choose posts from among the whole website to re-upload to the &quot;Hit&quot; gallery. There are no specific standards for choosing posts, but they are generally fun, useful posts. The user who created the original post can request it be deleted from the &quot;Hit&quot; gallery.

== Culture ==
The culture varies between different galleries. One shared trait is that users call themselves &quot;x-bung-i&quot; (x-), where &quot;x&quot; is the gallery name&#x27;s first syllable.

=== Anonymity ===
Users have the option to be anonymous, which led to the forum&#x27;s atmosphere being different from other major Korean forums.

Since 2007, you can choose to register, log-in and use your own account. Before that, it was a fully anonymous forum.

The anonymity led users to communicate casually, expressively, and with insults and abuses.

=== Parody and neologisms === 
The forum is a main source of popular jokes, buzzwords, and neologisms in South Korea. Parodies, satires and slang based on controversial social or political phenomena and public figures are shared, and are quickly spread to other online communities and eventually to news, advertisements and everyday life. Some popular slang is as follows:

* &quot;ing-yeo&quot; (), meaning a person who is incompetent and useless in society; it was used widely pre-2010.
* , which was generated in the History gallery, which was notorious for anti-Koreanism as of 2015. The word roughly means living in Korea is harsh and hopeless.

=== As an alternative mass media === 
Criticism of Hwang Woo-Suk was led by the Science gallery along with the gallery in 2005. The Stock gallery found video evidence for the trial of , a central figure of the 2016 South Korean political scandal. The video was referenced in the parliamentary audit by congresswoman Park Young-sun.

=== Conservatism and misogyny ===
Initially a voice for left-wing politics, mainstream users turned to right-wing and conservative views as early as 2013. However, because there are so many galleries and each gallery has different history and major themes, there are also left-wing and neutral galleries, so it is hard to say that there is a representative specific political tendency of all DC Inside galleries.

Many galleries are accused of misogyny, and the Baseball gallery has been called out for insults against women and controversial views on today&#x27;s equality and for its &quot;secondary abuse&quot; toward high school teachers reporting sexual assaults.

== Incidents and controversy ==

=== Formation of Megalia ===

The MERS gallery (short for Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak) was created in the spring of 2015, and became a place for bashing two women who were falsely accused of contracting MERS, refusing quarantine and going shopping in Hong Kong. They were bashed as &quot;kimchi women&quot; (; &quot;gimchi-nyeo&quot;), a misogynist term for women who only have shopping on their minds.

As this continued, an influx of feminists started using reactionary terms, coining &quot;gimchi-nam&quot; (), a reclaimed term which mocks Korean men. DC Inside intervened by instituting a policy which forbade the usage of &quot;gimchi-nam&quot;. A portion of its users regarded the measure as discriminatory, which eventually led to the creation of a feminist website, Megalia.

=== Lee Kun-hee death rumors ===
On 4 July 2016, police raided DC Inside and Ilbe Storage, which spread rumors of Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee&#x27;s death in an apparent bid to boost stock prices.

<text>Alexander Lennart Steen (born 1 March 1984) is a Canadian-born Swedish former professional ice hockey player. Steen was drafted 24th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, and started his NHL career with Toronto. Steen was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 2008, where he played the remainder of his career. Steen won the Stanley Cup with the Blues in 2019.

Steen is the son of Thomas Steen, who also played professional ice hockey and later became a conservative politician.

==Playing career==
===Elitserien (2001–2005)===
Steen played for Frölunda HC from 1999 to 2004. He spent the 2004–05 season with Modo Hockey after a highly controversial signing.

===Toronto Maple Leafs (2005–2008)===
In the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, Steen was selected in the first round by the Toronto Maple Leafs, 24th overall. He played his first game with the Leafs on 5 October 2005 during the season opener against the rival Ottawa Senators, and registered a minor penalty. His first career NHL goal came in the next game on 8 October against the Montreal Canadiens. This goal marked the first time a Swedish father (former Winnipeg Jets player Thomas Steen) and son both scored in the NHL (beating Robert Nilsson, son of Kent Nilsson, by 21 days).
Steen scored his first career hat-trick on 4 January 2007 against the Boston Bruins, ending with a five-point game night.

===St. Louis Blues (2008–2020)===
On 24 November 2008, Steen was traded by the Leafs, along with Carlo Colaiacovo, to the St. Louis Blues for Lee Stempniak.

On 1 July 2010, Steen signed a four-year contract extension with the Blues. He had an NHL career-high 51 points in the 2011–12 season.

On 25 September 2012, Steen returned to Modo Hockey on a short-term contract during the 2012–13 NHL lockout.

He was named the NHL First Star of the Month for October 2013, with his 11 goals leading the league, and 16 points, fourth-best. With a goal and an assist against the Carolina Hurricanes on November 16, Steen extended his point streak to 13 consecutive games, the best such streak by a Blues player since Pierre Turgeon in 1999–2000.

Steen signed a three-year, $17.4 million contract with the Blues on 18 December 2013.

On 4 April 2014, he was nominated by the St. Louis chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. The trophy is awarded annually to the player &quot;who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.&quot; Steen lead the Blues with 33 goals, and lead them in the points department as well with 62 points despite losing 11 games from a concussion in December 2013.

On 23 September 2016, he signed a four-year, $23 million contract extension with the Blues.

Steen won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals with the Blues, St. Louis&#x27; first Stanley Cup in their 52-year franchise history.

====Retirement====
On 17 December 2020, Steen announced his retirement from hockey due to a back injury. Steen finished his career fourth in games played, sixth in assists, and fifth in points in Blues franchise history. Additionally, he and his father are one of just four father-son duos to each obtain 600 points in the NHL.

==Post-playing career==
Steen spent the 2023-24 season working in the St. Louis Blues hockey operations department as a European development consultant. On June 13, 2024, it was announced that Steen would be promoted to special assistant to the general manager, with plans to become the general manager after the 2025-26 season.

==Personal life==
Alexander Steen&#x27;s father is former Winnipeg Jets star Thomas Steen, a forward who scored 817 points in 950 NHL games between 1981 and 1995. As Steen was born in Winnipeg during his father&#x27;s tenure with the Jets, he has dual Canadian and Swedish citizenship; he has chosen to represent Sweden in international hockey competition. Alexander has two surviving siblings — his youngest brother Amadeus died at the age of two months of a heart condition. His death was the motivation for Alex, along with family members, to create the Amadeus Steen Foundation to raise funds for, and offer support for, infant and child health care.

<text>Ivar&#x27;s is a seafood restaurant chain based in Seattle, Washington, United States, with operations in the Puget Sound region.

Ivar&#x27;s also owns the Seattle-based burger restaurant chain Kidd Valley.

==History==
Ivar&#x27;s was founded in 1938 by Seattle folk singer Ivar Haglund. Having built Seattle&#x27;s first aquarium on what is now Pier 54, he decided to add a companion fish and chips bar to feed his visitors. The bar was short-lived, however. On July 22, 1946, Haglund opened a new restaurant, Ivar&#x27;s Acres of Clams, at the same location. The aquarium closed ten years later, but the restaurant remains.

Ivar&#x27;s has two other full-service restaurants: Ivar&#x27;s Salmon House in Seattle&#x27;s Northlake neighborhood, and Ivar&#x27;s Mukilteo Landing in Mukilteo, Washington, next to the Washington State Ferries terminal. There is a fishbar outside of all three full-service restaurants. All its other locations are seafood bars.

Nard Jones remarked in 1972 that Haglund was &quot;not afraid to reflect Puget Sound tradition in the decor of his restaurants, whereas others of his profession seem intent on making their patrons forget where they are.&quot; In this respect, he singled out the Salmon House, &quot;an almost exact replica of an old Indian longhouse.&quot;

Every Independence Day from 1964 until 2008, Ivar&#x27;s sponsored the Fourth of Jul-Ivar&#x27;s festival and fireworks show at Downtown Seattle&#x27;s Myrtle Edwards Park on Elliott Bay. Ivar&#x27;s estimated its attendance at around 300,000 people. On April 3, 2009, Ivar&#x27;s announced it was no longer sponsoring its Fourth of Jul-Ivar&#x27;s community fireworks show. Ivar&#x27;s decided to focus its efforts on feeding families in the Pacific Northwest through its partnership with Northwest Harvest.

In 2021, &quot;Kettle Classic Clam Chowder with Uncured Bacon&quot;, sold only at Costco, was recalled in 13 states for plastic in the Chowder.

==Underwater billboard hoax==
Capitalizing on founder Haglund&#x27;s reputation for eccentric marketing stunts, Ivar&#x27;s put out a story that Haglund had placed billboards on the bottom of the Sound, related to a proposal he had once made for submarine traffic as a viable mode of transportation. Some documentation was released, including maps of possible sub-aquatic billboard locations. On August 22, 2009 one of the rumored signs was discovered and hoisted out of the water, advertising a cup of Clam Chowder for $0.75. Several other signs followed. The signs were displayed publicly as authentic, with Ivar&#x27;s saying that for a time they would honor the $0.75 price for chowder.

All of this turned out to be a hoax. The signs were sunk earlier in 2009, and local historian Paul Dorpat had deliberately furthered the hoax. Dorpat, of HistoryLink contributes a weekly column to the &quot;Seattle Times,&quot; and attempted to hoax that newspaper, whose first story about the billboards cast doubt on their authenticity, stating, &quot;if it was a hoax, a prime suspect would be the Ivar&#x27;s chain itself.&quot; Several minor clues were placed to guarantee that the hoax would eventually unravel. For example, the chowder price wasn&#x27;t correct for the ostensible date, and the wrong governor&#x27;s name was on the letterhead from the Department of Fisheries.

<text>Justin Pogge (; born April 22, 1986) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 2008–09 season. Internationally Pogge played for the Canadian national junior team at the 2006 World Junior Championship, winning a gold medal.

==Playing career==
Pogge played his first one-and-a-half seasons in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Prince George Cougars before being dealt to the Calgary Hitmen at the 2004–05 trade deadline. After his rookie season with the Cougars, he was drafted in the third round, 90th overall, by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He was then signed to a three-year, entry-level contract by the Leafs on December 19, 2005. Playing for the Hitmen in 2005–06, Pogge was awarded the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy as league MVP as well as the CHL Goaltender of the Year Award and Del Wilson Trophy as the top WHL goaltender with a 1.72 goals against average (GAA) and 11 shutouts.

Pogge turned pro in 2006–07 with the Maple Leafs American Hockey League affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. He received his first call-up to the Maple Leafs on January 11, 2008, but did not suit up and was reassigned to the Marlies the next day. Recording 19 wins and a 3.03 GAA in his professional rookie season, he was awarded the Marlies Fan Choice Award.
The following season, on December 21, 2008, Pogge earned another call-up from the Marlies and made his first NHL start against the Atlanta Thrashers the next night, recording a win in a 6–2 victory. On January 27, 2009, he suffered his first loss in the NHL versus the Minnesota Wild 6–1.

On August 10, 2009, Pogge was traded to the Anaheim Ducks for a conditional 2011 draft pick. On March 3, 2010, he was again traded to the Carolina Hurricanes as part of a deal that sent Aaron Ward to the Ducks.

On July 27, 2011, Pogge signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. He played for their AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates for the duration of the season.

On July 18, 2012, Pogge decided to leave North American professional hockey and signed his first European contract with Ritten Sport of the Elite.A, a top level team in Italy, for the duration of the 2012–13 season.

Pogge then left for Sweden and signed a one-year contract with BIK Karlskoga in the HockeyAllsvenskan for the duration of the 2013–14 season.

On April 28, 2014, Pogge opted to remain in Sweden, and at an elevated level after signing a contract with Färjestad BK of the SHL. He left Färjestad after completing the 2015-16 season and signed with HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in May 2016.

After leaving Kölner Haie after two seasons, Pogge was signed to a one-year contract with his third DEL club, Grizzlys Wolfsburg, on July 26, 2022.

==Post-playing career==
On May 18, 2023, Pogge announced his retirement from professional hockey. He was in the midst of working as a goaltending consultant for Canada at the World Championship, and had earlier worked in the same role for the team at the World U18 Championships.

Pogge worked as a goaltending consultant for the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2023-24 season.

On August 26, 2024, the Abbotsford Canucks hired Pogge as their goaltending coach.

==International play==


In his third and final year of major junior, Pogge was named to Canada&#x27;s national junior team for the 2006 World Junior Championships as the host nation in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was initially not invited to Canada&#x27;s junior summer camp and was, therefore, not expected to make the team. However, Pogge was named to the team&#x27;s final selection camp in December and earned the starting position. He led Team Canada to a second straight gold medal by posting a shutout with 35 saves against Russia in the 5–0 gold medal game victory. Pogge finished the tournament with 3 shutouts and a 1.00 GAA.

Later that year, during Pogge&#x27;s professional rookie season with the Toronto Marlies, he represented Canada at the 2006 Spengler Cup in Davos, Switzerland. He helped Canada to the final game, where they lost to HC Davos 3–2. Pogge was criticized for surrendering the game winning goal after misplaying the puck behind his net, giving it away to the HC Davos player Andres Ambuhl.

==Personal==
Pogge married his fiancé Christina Heinzel in May 2013.

<doc id="782092" wikidata="Q1087640" url="?curid=782092" title="Chrome (band)">
<text>Chrome is an American rock band founded in San Francisco in 1976 by musician Damon Edge and associated with the 1970s post-punk movement. The group&#x27;s raw sound blended elements of punk, psychedelia, and early industrial music, incorporating science-fiction themes, tape experimentation, distorted acid rock guitar, and electronic noise. They have been cited as forerunners of the 1980s industrial music boom.

They found little commercial success as part of San Francisco&#x27;s 1970s music scene, but developed a cult following in the United Kingdom and Germany following the release of the LPs &quot;Alien Soundtracks&quot; (1977) and &quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot; (1979). Edge died in 1995; subsequently, guitarist Helios Creed has revived the Chrome name for recordings and performances.

==History==
Chrome was formed in 1975 by Damon Edge (real name Thomas Wisse: drums, vocals, synths, production) and Gary Spain (bass guitar, violin) in San Francisco. While studying at the California Institute of the Arts, Edge became influenced in making unusual sounds; this progressed after a trip to Morocco where he heard a lot of Arabic music. In his head, he began putting a beat behind the music and started coming up with ideas for songs. Chrome&#x27;s music contained a lot of atmosphere in the sound production, featuring three- and eight-note melodies, usually layered with an atonal drone backed by a rhythm section. This sort of atmosphere was influenced by the music he had heard in Morocco. About six months after that trip, Edge began forming a band and recording his new music.

Chrome took part of their inspiration for their rough and sometimes chaotic music from punk pioneers like the Stooges. They recorded and released their first album, &quot;The Visitation&quot;, along with John Lambdin (guitar) and Mike Low (guitar, vocals). After recording &quot;The Visitation&quot;, Edge sent the album to Warner Brothers to see if they wanted to release the album. A Warner Brothers A&amp;R representative told Edge that the album sounded like a &quot;messed up Doors album&quot;; to Damon Edge, this was a compliment. The label did not release the album, so Edge set up his own label, Siren Records. After the recording of the first album, singer Mike Low left the band, to be replaced by new guitarist Helios Creed.

Chrome&#x27;s commercial and artistic breakthrough came in 1977 with their second album, &quot;Alien Soundtracks&quot;. The album began as &quot;Ultra Soundtrack&quot;, a soundtrack for a radical San Francisco strip show, but was rejected for being too radical. During recording, Chrome, aided by Creed&#x27;s input, largely abandoned conventional rock compositions, instead employing cut-up and collage techniques and heavily processed sound to create a kind of sci-fi punk style. The album was given 4 out of 5 stars in the UK music paper &quot;Sounds&quot;, and Chrome began gradually to gain a cult reputation in the UK and in Europe.

After recording &quot;Alien Soundtracks&quot;, John Lambdin left the band. Their third studio album, &quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot;, was released in 1979. &quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot; continued in the vein of the previous album, but heavier, with Creed&#x27;s feedback guitar more to the fore. Edge&#x27;s rough and ready drumming on this album included hitting pieces of scrap metal. &quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot; remains their best-known work. It was listed at No. 62 in &quot;The Wire&quot; list of &quot;100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)&quot;, and was cited as the &quot;beginning of industrial rock&quot;.

&quot;Half Machine Lip Moves&quot; and their 1979 EP &quot;Read Only Memory&quot; cemented the band&#x27;s growing reputation in the UK and led to the band being signed to Beggars Banquet Records for their fourth album, &quot;Red Exposure&quot;. By this time Chrome consisted solely of Edge and Creed. The album marked a move away from the more frenetic style of the two previous albums, with more use of drum machines and synthesizers.

In 1980, Edge met singer Fabienne Shine, formerly of the band Shakin&#x27; Street, and married her two months later. She went on to collaborate with him on several Chrome albums; her vocals appear on the album &quot;3rd from the Sun&quot;.

After a further EP and single, Chrome again expanded to a quartet with the addition of the new rhythm section of John and Hilary Stench (real surname: Hanes). This lineup existed circa 1980–1983, and produced the albums &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; (1981) and &quot;3rd from the Sun&quot; (1982), and the new material comprising the fifth and sixth LPs of the 1982 &quot;Chrome Box&quot; set (entitled &quot;Chronicles I&quot; and &quot;Chronicles II&quot;). Abbreviated versions of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; material was also released in France as an album entitled &quot;Raining Milk&quot;, and would later be reissued in their original longer versions on the distinct albums &quot;Chronicles I&quot; and &quot;Chronicles II&quot;. The title track from &quot;3rd from the Sun&quot; was covered by the band Prong. It appeared on their album &quot;Force Fed&quot; (1989) and as a live version on &quot;Beg to Differ&quot; (1990), but in both cases only as a CD bonus track.

In 1983, Edge moved to Paris. Shine introduced him to her band and a new lineup of Chrome was formed. Edge and his wife would later separate. Edge continued to release albums with various (mainly Europe-based) musicians under the Chrome moniker over the next decade.

In August 1995, Edge was found dead in his Redondo Beach apartment in California; the cause of death was heart failure. Edge had been in contact with Creed and talked about reforming Chrome.

Alternative Press included Chrome in their 1996 list of &quot;100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.&quot;

After she and Edge separated, Shine continued to compose songs. In 1997, after Edge&#x27;s death, she released an album titled &quot;No Mad Nomad&quot;. The title referred to her late husband. In 2004, she began working and touring again with Creed.

A Creed-led version of Chrome that featured previous members John and Hilary Stench released a series of albums and toured between 1997 and 2001. Creed later reactivated the Chrome name again, issuing a new album, &quot;Feel It Like a Scientist&quot;, in 2014.

The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Techromancy&quot;, was released April 21, 2017, followed by a US tour.

As of 2018, Chrome&#x27;s current line-up consisted of Creed, Tommy Grenas, Aleph Omega, Lux Vibratus, Lou Minatti and Steve Fishman.

<doc id="782099" wikidata="Q4948983" url="?curid=782099" title="Bott periodicity theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Bott periodicity theorem describes a periodicity in the homotopy groups of classical groups, discovered by , which proved to be of foundational significance for much further research, in particular in K-theory of stable complex vector bundles, as well as the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Bott periodicity can be formulated in numerous ways, with the periodicity in question always appearing as a period-2 phenomenon, with respect to dimension, for the theory associated to the unitary group. See for example topological K-theory.

There are corresponding period-8 phenomena for the matching theories, (real) KO-theory and (quaternionic) KSp-theory, associated to the real orthogonal group and the quaternionic symplectic group, respectively. The J-homomorphism is a homomorphism from the homotopy groups of orthogonal groups to stable homotopy groups of spheres, which causes the period 8 Bott periodicity to be visible in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.

==Statement of result==

Bott showed that if formula_1 is defined as the inductive limit of the orthogonal groups, then its homotopy groups are periodic:
:formula_2 
and the first 8 homotopy groups are as follows:
:formula_3

==Context and significance==
The context of Bott periodicity is that the homotopy groups of spheres, which would be expected to play the basic part in algebraic topology by analogy with homology theory, have proved elusive (and the theory is complicated). The subject of stable homotopy theory was conceived as a simplification, by introducing the suspension (smash product with a circle) operation, and seeing what (roughly speaking) remained of homotopy theory once one was allowed to suspend both sides of an equation as many times as one wished. The stable theory was still hard to compute with, in practice.

What Bott periodicity offered was an insight into some highly non-trivial spaces, with central status in topology because of the connection of their cohomology with characteristic classes, for which all the (&quot;unstable&quot;) homotopy groups could be calculated. These spaces are the (infinite, or &quot;stable&quot;) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups &quot;U&quot;, &quot;O&quot; and Sp. In this context, &quot;stable&quot; refers to taking the union &quot;U&quot; (also known as the direct limit) of the sequence of inclusions

:formula_4

and similarly for &quot;O&quot; and Sp. Note that Bott&#x27;s use of the word &quot;stable&quot; in the title of his seminal paper refers to these stable classical groups and not to stable homotopy groups.

The important connection of Bott periodicity with the stable homotopy groups of spheres formula_5 comes via the so-called stable &quot;J&quot;-homomorphism from the (unstable) homotopy groups of the (stable) classical groups to these stable homotopy groups formula_5. Originally described by George W. Whitehead, it became the subject of the famous Adams conjecture (1963) which was finally resolved in the affirmative by Daniel Quillen (1971).

Bott&#x27;s original results may be succinctly summarized in:

Corollary: The (unstable) homotopy groups of the (infinite) classical groups are periodic:

:formula_7

Note: The second and third of these isomorphisms intertwine to give the 8-fold periodicity results:

:formula_8

==Loop spaces and classifying spaces==
For the theory associated to the infinite unitary group, &quot;U&quot;, the space &quot;BU&quot; is the classifying space for stable complex vector bundles (a Grassmannian in infinite dimensions). One formulation of Bott periodicity describes the twofold loop space, formula_9 of &quot;BU&quot;. Here, formula_10 is the loop space functor, right adjoint to suspension and left adjoint to the classifying space construction. Bott periodicity states that this double loop space is essentially &quot;BU&quot; again; more precisely,
formula_11
is essentially (that is, homotopy equivalent to) the union of a countable number of copies of &quot;BU&quot;. An equivalent formulation is
formula_12

Either of these has the immediate effect of showing why (complex) topological &quot;K&quot;-theory is a 2-fold periodic theory.

In the corresponding theory for the infinite orthogonal group, &quot;O&quot;, the space &quot;BO&quot; is the classifying space for stable real vector bundles. In this case, Bott periodicity states that, for the 8-fold loop space,
formula_13
or equivalently,
formula_14

which yields the consequence that &quot;KO&quot;-theory is an 8-fold periodic theory. Also, for the infinite symplectic group, Sp, the space BSp is the classifying space for stable quaternionic vector bundles, and Bott periodicity states that
formula_15
or equivalently
formula_16

Thus both topological real &quot;K&quot;-theory (also known as &quot;KO&quot;-theory) and topological quaternionic &quot;K&quot;-theory (also known as KSp-theory) are 8-fold periodic theories.

==Geometric model of loop spaces==
One elegant formulation of Bott periodicity makes use of the observation that there are natural embeddings (as closed subgroups) between the classical groups. The loop spaces in Bott periodicity are then homotopy equivalent to the symmetric spaces of successive quotients, with additional discrete factors of Z.

Over the complex numbers:

:formula_17

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

:formula_18

These sequences corresponds to sequences in Clifford algebras – see classification of Clifford algebras; over the complex numbers:

:formula_19

Over the real numbers and quaternions:

:formula_20

where the division algebras indicate &quot;matrices over that algebra&quot;.
As they are 2-periodic/8-periodic, they can be arranged in a circle, where they are called the Bott periodicity clock and Clifford algebra clock.

The Bott periodicity results then refine to a sequence of homotopy equivalences:

For complex &quot;K&quot;-theory:

:formula_21

For real and quaternionic &quot;KO&quot;- and KSp-theories:

:formula_22

The resulting spaces are homotopy equivalent to the classical reductive symmetric spaces, and are the successive quotients of the terms of the Bott periodicity clock. These equivalences immediately yield the Bott periodicity theorems.

The specific spaces are, (for groups, the principal homogeneous space is also listed):
==Proofs==
Bott&#x27;s original proof used Morse theory, which had used earlier to study the homology of Lie groups. Many different proofs have been given.

<text>Planet Mu is an English electronic music record label created and run by Mike Paradinas. The label started out as a subsidiary of Virgin Records then Paradinas set up the label independent of Virgin. After releasing intelligent dance music, the label moved to jungle and breakcore, and then grime and dubstep and later footwork. The label also releases the music of Paradinas under various aliases such as μ-Ziq, Kid Spatula, and Tusken Raiders. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2020.

== Beginning ==

When Mike Paradinas signed as a musician to Virgin Records in the mid-1990s, Paradinas was asked for suggestions for the new dance subsidiary and suggested Planet Mu as a play on Carl Craig&#x27;s label Planet E. When Virgin lost interest in the project, Paradinas took it over. He quickly drew critical acclaim for releasing a string of important IDM (intelligent dance music) records, from artists such as Jega, Leafcutter John, Luke Vibert, WWWINGS, and Venetian Snares. The label also releases Paradinas&#x27;s music under a range of aliases including Kid Spatula, Tusken Raiders, and Mu-Ziq, establishing itself as an electronic music label to rival Skam Records and Warp records.

== Progression ==
As the new decade began, Planet Mu began to release jungle and breakcore records from artists such as 0=0, Tim Exile and Shitmat. Later in the decade, Paradinas moved towards grime and dubstep, signing artists such as Boxcutter, Milanese, Mr. Mitch, Pinch, Vex&#x27;d, and Virus Syndicate. In 2006, the label released three &quot;Warrior Dubz&quot; compilations curated by Mary Anne Hobbs. In the 2010s, Planet Mu changed direction again, releasing the footwork compilation &quot;Bangs &amp; Works Vol. 1&quot; which featured DJ Rashad and brought the Chicago genre to wider attention. &quot;Bangs &amp; Works Vol. 2&quot; came out the following year and launched the career of Jlin.

In 2020, the label celebrated its 25th birthday. In 2019 it had not made a profit but in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, sales went up. It released the compilation &quot;PlanetMμ25&quot; which featured grime from East Man &amp; Streema, pop from RUI-HO, IDM from Bogdan Raczynski and jazz from Jana Rush.

<text>John Rogers (January 11, 1630 – July 12, 1684) was an English Puritan minister and academic in early Colonial America.

==Early life and education==
Rogers was born in Coggeshall, England, the eldest son of minister Nathaniel Rogers. In 1636, he immigrated to New England with his family. In 1649, at age 19, he earned a B.A. from Harvard College which, only seven years earlier, in 1642, had graduated its first class of students. In 1652, following an additional three years of study, he received an M.A. and, in 1660, married Elizabeth Denison of Ipswich, Massachusetts.

==Career==
Residing in Ipswich and, despite neither having been ordained as a minister or trained as a physician, Rogers practiced medicine and assisted in the ministry of his brother-in-law, local historian William Hubbard, who served as Ipswich pastor for over 50 years.

===Harvard College president===
In 1682, Rogers was appointed President of Harvard, following the death of Urian Oakes. Rogers was not the first choice as successor by the Governing Board of Harvard; first choice Cotton Mather could not be released from his pastoral obligations, and a second choice declined, prior to Rogers accepting the position.

Puritan minister and author Cotton Mather, Rogers was &quot;sweet-tempered...genuinely pious and a accomplished gentleman given to long winded daily prayers.&quot; American historian Samuel Eliot Morison says that Rogers would have &quot;made a successful president&quot;, but he only held the position for two years, prior to his sudden death at the age of 54. He was buried at Old Burying Ground in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<text>A serapeum is a temple or other religious institution dedicated to the syncretic Greco-Egyptian deity Serapis, who combined aspects of Osiris and Apis in a humanized form that was accepted by the Ptolemaic Greeks of Alexandria. There were several such religious centers, each of which was called a &quot;serapeion/serapeum&quot; () or &quot;poserapi&quot; (), coming from an Egyptian name for the temple of Osiris-Apis ().

==Egyptian serapea==
===Alexandria===

The Serapeum of Alexandria in the Ptolemaic Kingdom was an ancient Greek temple built by Ptolemy III Euergetes. There are also signs of Harpocrates. It has been referred to as the daughter of the Library of Alexandria. It existed until the end of the fourth century AD.

===Saqqara===
The Serapeum of Saqqara is located north west of the Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara, a necropolis near Memphis in Lower Egypt. It was a burial place of the Apis, sacred bulls that were incarnations of Ptah. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as Osiris-Apis, a name shortened to Serapis in the Hellenic period.

===Canopus===
Another serapeum was located at Canopus, in the Nile Delta near Alexandria. This sanctuary, dedicated to Isis and her consort Serapis, became one of the most famous cult centers of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt. Its festivals and rites were so popular that the site became an architectural model for sanctuaries to the Egyptian gods throughout the Roman Empire.

At this Graeco-Roman site, a sacred temenos enclosed the temple dedicated to the gods, which was located behind a propylaea or peristyle court. Auxiliary shrines dedicated to other, less universal, Egyptian deities could be found here as well, including those dedicated to Anubis (Hermanubis), Hermes Trismegistus, the syncretism of Thoth and Hermes, Harpocrates, and others. Ritual complexes dedicated to Isis were often built around a well or a spring, which was meant to represent the miraculous annual inundation of the Nile. This was also the case in sanctuaries devoted to the Egyptian gods in Roman-era Delos, where a central basin provided the water element central in the rites of Isis.

==Serapea in Italy==

===&quot;Regio tertia&quot;===
The &quot;Regio III&quot; within the city of Rome was named &quot;Isis et Serapis&quot; because it contained a temple dedicated to the two Egyptian deities. The structure, originally dedicated to Isis alone, was built by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius in the first half of the 1st century BCE to celebrate his father&#x27;s victory over Jugurtha.

The complex, of which only parts of the foundations remain, was originally terraced; during the Flavian dynasty, it underwent major renovations, and the cult of Serapis was associated to that of Isis. The temple was finally demolished during the 6th century.

===Campus Martius===

This temple, dedicated to Isis and Serapis, was first dedicated by the triumvirs in 43 BCE in Rome. However, due to later tensions between Octavian (later Augustus Caesar) and Marc Antony, the temple was not built. Following the Battle at Actium, Augustus banned the religion from within the pomerium of Rome altogether. The temple was finally built by Gaius Caligula on the area known as Campus Martius, between the Saepta Julia and the temple of Minerva c. 37–41 CE.

The Serapeum, long and wide, was divided in three sections: a rectangular area could be accessed first by walking under monumental arches; an open square, adorned with red granite obelisks brought to the city during the 1st century and erected in couples, followed. The centre of the square was likely occupied by the temple dedicated to Isis, while the third section, a semicircular exedra with an apse presumably hosted the altar dedicated to Serapis. Fragments of the obelisks, some quite large, have been found around the current church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva; some archaeologists have proposed that the obelisk facing the Pantheon (see picture) may have been repositioned from the temple to its current location.

The building was destroyed in the great fire of the year 80 CE and rebuilt by Domitian; further renovation was initiated by Hadrian, while Septimius Severus ordered the necessary upkeep of the temple&#x27;s structure. Written records attest to the Serapeum&#x27;s existence and ritual activity until the 5th century.

===Quirinal Hill===

The temple built on Quirinal Hill and dedicated to Serapis was, by most surviving accounts, the most sumptuous and architectonically ambitious of those built on the hill; its remains are still visible between Palazzo Colonna and the Pontifical Gregorian University.

The sanctuary, which lay between today&#x27;s &quot;piazza della Pilotta&quot; and the large square facing Quirinal Palace, was built by Caracalla on the western slopes of the hill, covering over , as its sides measured . It was composed by a long courtyard (surrounded by a colonnade) and by the ritual area, where statues and obelisks had been erected. Designed to impress its visitors, the temple boasted columns tall and in diameter, visually sitting atop a marble stairway that connected the base of the hill to the sanctuary.

An enormous fragment of entablature, weighing approximately 100 tons and in volume (the largest in Rome), belongs to the original temple, as do the statues of the Nile and the Tiber, moved by Michelangelo to the Capitoline Hill in front of the Senate building.

===Hadrian&#x27;s Villa===

Emperor Hadrian (117–138) ordered the construction of a &quot;canopus&quot; in his villa in Tivoli with typical imperial grandeur: an immense rectangular tank representing a canal, long by wide was surrounded by porticoes and statues, leading the way to a Serapeum. Protected by a monumental dome, the sanctuary was composed of a public area and a more intimate subterranean part that was dedicated to the chthonic aspect of Serapis.

To mark the inauguration of his temple, Hadrian struck coinage that carry his effigy accompanied by Serapis, upon a dais where two columns support a round canopy. In this manner, the emperor became &quot;synnaos&quot;, a companion of the god&#x27;s arcane &quot;naos&quot; and equal beneficiary of the cult of Serapis at Canopus.

In February 2021, archaeologists led by researcher Rafael Hidalgo Prieto from the Pablo de Olavide University announced the discovery of remains of Hadrian&#x27;s breakfast room which used to show his imperial power. They revealed a structure as a water triclinium and a separate dining room that served as a model for the well-known Serapeum in his villa.

===Ostia Antica===

The Serapeum of Ostia Antica was inaugurated in 127 CE and dedicated to the syncretic cult of Jupiter Serapis.

It is a typical Roman sanctuary, on a raised platform and with a row of columns at the entrance, where a mosaic representing Apis in a typically Egyptian manner can still be seen. From this temple likely came the statue that Bryaxis copied for the Serapeum in Alexandria.

===Pozzuoli===
The Macellum of Pozzuoli, marketplace or macellum of the Roman city of Puteoli (now known as Pozzuoli) was first excavated in the 18th century, when the discovery of a statue of Serapis led to the building being misidentified as the city&#x27;s serapeum, the Temple of Serapis. Under that name, the site had considerable influence on early geology as a band of boreholes affecting the three standing columns suggested that the building had been partly below sea level for some period.

== Serapea in Tunisia ==

=== Pergamon ===
Inside Pergamon in Bergama, there is the Temple of Serapis, built for the Egyptian gods in the 2nd century CE and called the Red Basilica (&quot;Kızıl Avlu&quot; in Turkish) by locals. This is a basilica-shaped building constructed under the reign of Hadrian. It consists of a main building and two round towers. In the Christian New Testament, the Church at Pergamon, inside the main building of the Red Basilica, is listed as one of the Seven Churches to which the Book of Revelation was addressed ().

=== Ephesus ===
Another serapeum was in Ephesus, which is near present-day Selçuk, İzmir Province, Turkey. The temple is located behind the Library of Celsus. This Egyptian temple was turned into a Christian church.

=== Miletus ===
This temple was built in the 3rd century BCE near the south agora of Miletus and also it was restored by Emperor Julius Aurelius (270–275 CE).

<text>Aristander of Telmessos (; born , ), a Greek from Caria, was Alexander the Great&#x27;s favorite seer.

==Life==
Aristander belonged to the entourage of Alexander&#x27;s father, Philip II of Macedon, in 357/6, when he correctly interpreted a dream as revealing Olympias&#x27; pregnancy. The ancient sources place him interpreting omens from the conqueror&#x27;s birth to his death. Although details are variously given, and some incidents are fictitious, Aristander was clearly an influential presence during Alexander&#x27;s campaigns, and played an important role in uplifting the morale of the Macedonian army. There are indications he wrote divinatory works, either before, during or after the expedition, although it is also possible these works were spuriously attributed.

==Aristander in the sources==
A represents Arrian, P Plutarch, C Curtius, D Diodorus, J Justin, S Strabo, I the &quot;Itinerarium Alexandri&quot;. Passages in which Aristander is mentioned by name are marked with an asterisk (*).

# Philip dreams he sealed up the womb of his wife Olympias, and that the seal bore a lion device. Aristander interprets the dream optimistically – that the child Olympias bore (Alexander) would be lion-like and brave. (*P 2.2–3; Ephorus, see &quot;FGrH&quot; 70, 217)
# Statue of Orpheus in Pieria sweats. Aristander interprets optimistically that it means Alexander will cause poets and musicians much sweat in reciting and celebrating his deeds. (*A 1.11.1–2; *P 14.5; I 17; Pseudo-Callisthenes, &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; 1.42)
# Army comes across a fallen statue of Ariobarzanes, former satrap of Phrygia. The seer “Alexander” [Aristander?] interprets predicts the victory at Granicus. (D 17.17.6–7)
# An insistent swallow bothers the drowsing Alexander at Halicarnassus. Aristander interprets the event to mean that a plot will be revealed to Alexander. (*A 1.25.6–8)
# Macedonian soldiers engaged in the siege of Tyre discover that some of the ration bread is “bloody.” Aristander forecasts that Tyre will be taken (because the bread is bloody on the inside). (*C 4.2.14; 17.41.7)
# Alexander dreams that Heracles invited him into Tyre. Aristander interprets this to mean that the city will be captured, but with Herculean effort. (*A 2.18.1, C 4.2.17)
# Alexander, besieging Tyre, dreams about a mocking satyr. In Artemidorus Aristander and in P “seers” play with words (“sa tyros”=&quot;tyre is thine&quot;) to decide that Alexander will take the city. In Ps-Calisthenes the Satyr also gives him a cheese (“tyros”) to trample. (Artemidorus, &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; 4.23–24; P 24.3–5; &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; 1.35; Artemidorus incident unnoticed by Jacoby)
# Aristander, examining entrails, declares that Tyre will be taken that month, even though it is the last day. Alexander decrees a two-day change in the calendar, but then takes the city the same day. (*P 25.1–2)
# During the siege of Gaza, a bird drops something on Alexander and is caught. Aristander predicts personal danger for Alexander that day, and is proven right. (*A 2.26.4–27.2; *C 4.6.10–13; *P 25.3–4; I 46–7)
# Foundation of Alexandria. Alexander outlines city with barley meal. In P, S, I and &quot;Frag. Sab.&quot; birds descend upon it. Aristander projects a prosperous future. (*A 3.1.5–3.2.2; C 4.8.6; P 26.5–6; S 17.1.6; I 49; FGrH 151=Frag. Sab. 11; others)
# Eclipse occurs twelve days before the Battle of Gaugamela. Aristander (in A) or “Egyptian soothsayers” (in C) interpret the omen favorably. (*A 3.7.6; C 4.10.2–7; see P 31.4)
# Alexander conducts sacrifices with Aristander the night before the Battle of Gaugamela. (*C 4.13.14–16; *P 31.4; &quot;FGrH&quot; 148 = &quot;Pap. Oxyrch.&quot; 1798)
# Aristander seen among Alexander&#x27;s soldiers at Gaugamela. Points out an eagle directly above Alexander&#x27;s head. (*C 4.15.26–27; *P 33.1–2)
# Aristander sacrifices before crossing the Tanais. He reports the omens are unfavorable. He is subsequently asked to sacrifice again and (in A) proclaims another unfavorable omen or (in C) changes his mind. C relates at length how Alexander rebukes Aristander for failing to report the first forecast directly to the king. (*A 4.4.3; 4.4.9, *C 7.7.8–9; 7.722–29, I 85)
# Cleitus interrupts a sacrifice to sample some fruit, but the sheep follow him. Alexander orders Aristander and “Cleomantis the Spartan” to interpret the event. Both interpret the event pessimistically. (*P 50.2–4)
# Alexander, having killed Cleitus, is consoled by Aristander, who “reminds” him of his prophecy (number 14). Alexander is cheered. (*P 52.1; see A 4.9.5)
# Petroleum is discovered. Aristander predicts that the oil portends success after toil. (*A 4.15.7–8, C 7.10.4; P 57.3; S 9.7.3; Athen. 42 f.; I 97)
# Lysimachus blunders into the back of Alexander&#x27;s spear. Alexander staunches the wound with his diadem. The bloody diadem impels Aristander to predict a troubled reign for Lysimachus. J has the event take place in India. (*Appian, &quot;Syriaca&quot; 64; J 15.3.11–14)
# Aristander scolds Macedonians for not dealing with Alexander&#x27;s body, and predicts a bright future for the city that holds it. (*Aelian, &quot;Varia Historia&quot; 12.64)

==Aristander&#x27;s writings==
Writings by Aristander are attested by: Pliny the Elder (&quot;Natural History&quot; 17); Artemidorus (&quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; 1.31, 4.23-24); Origen (&quot;Contra Celsum&quot; 6.8.10); see Lucian (citation missing). It is possible that Aristander&#x27;s writings were, instead, a product of an Aristandrian &quot;school.&quot; Aristander&#x27;s home town, Telmessus in Caria (modern Fethiye), was a proverbial font of seers. There may be some connection between the two items of &quot;Successor Propaganda&quot; (18–19, favoring Lysimachus and Ptolemy) and the rule of Ptolemy I Epigone as dynast in Telmessos. Ptolemy as the son of Lysimachus inherited his father&#x27;s claims, but eventually made peace with Ptolemy III Euergetes and the Ptolemaic dynasty.

<text>Ramakanta Rath (born 13 December 1934) is one of the most renowned modernist poets in the Odia literature. Heavily influenced by the poets such as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, Rath experimented greatly with form and style. The quest for the mystical, the riddles of life and death, the inner solitude of individual selves, and subservience to material needs and carnal desires are among this philosopher-poet&#x27;s favorite themes. His poetry betrays a sense of pessimism along with counter-aesthetics, and he steadfastly refuses to put on the garb of a preacher of goodness and absolute beauty. His poetry is full of melancholy and laments the inevitability of death and the resultant feeling of futility. The poetic expressions found in his creations carry a distinct sign of symbolic annotations to spiritual and metaphysical contents of life. Often transcending beyond ordinary human capabilities, the poet reaches the higher territories of sharp intellectualism. The contents have varied from a modernist interpretation of ancient Sanskrit literature protagonist Radha in the poem &quot;Sri Radha&quot; to the ever-present and enthralling death-consciousness espoused in &quot;Saptama Ritu&quot; (The Seventh Season).

Rath was born in Cuttack, Odisha (India). He obtained his MA in English Literature from Ravenshaw College in Odisha. He joined the Indian Administrative Service in 1957, but continued his writing career. He retired as Chief Secretary Odisha after holding several important posts in the Central Government such as Secretary to the Government of India. He received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977, Saraswathi Samman in 1992, Bishuva Samman in 1990 and India&#x27;s 3rd highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan in 2006. He was the Vice President of the Sahitya Academy of India from 1993 to 1998 and the President of the Sahitya Akademi of India from 1998 to 2003, New Delhi.

In February 2009 he was awarded a Sahitya Akademi Fellowship by the Central Sahitya Akademi, the fifth Odia writer to be so honoured.

A number of his poems have been translated into English and other Indian languages.

<text>John Leverett (August 25, 1662 – May 3, 1724) was an early Anglo-American lawyer, politician, educator, and President of Harvard College.

==Early life and education==
Leverett was born on August 25, 1662, in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, the son of Hudson Leverett, an attorney, and Sarah (Payton) Leverett, and grandson of John Leverett who was later the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was educated at Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1680 and a Master of Arts in 1683.

==Career==

For twelve years, Leverett was a resident fellow at Harvard. He was appointed in 1685 at the same time as William Brattle. Leverett and Brattle managed Harvard College while Harvard&#x27;s President Increase Mather was in England for four years (1688–1692)

On November 25, 1697, Leverett married Margaret Rogers Berry, the daughter of former Harvard College president John Rogers. They had nine children, six of whom died in infancy. Margaret died on June 7, 1720. Leverett married secondly Sarah Crisp Harris. Sarah died on April 4, 1744.

John served in the Province of Massachusetts Bay as a justice of the peace (1699), a judge in the Court of Admiralty (1705), a justice of the Superior Court (1702–1708), judge of Probate Court for Middlesex County in Cambridge (1702–1708), legislator(1696–1702) and Speaker of the Colonial Massachusetts House of Representatives (1700–1702), and provincial councillor for eastern Maine (1706–1708).

Leverett acted as an Indian commissioner from Massachusetts during Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1701–1713). He was unable to persuade the Iroquois to enter the war on the side of the British at a conference in 1704. Leverett raised and commanded a company of volunteers (as a lieutenant in the Military Company of Massachusetts, which he joined in 1704) in the failed assaults on French Port Royal, Acadia in 1707.

Leverett served as President of Harvard from January 14, 1708, until his death in 1724. In 1709, Leverett served as an emissary from Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley to New York Governor John Lovelace in negotiations for the establishment of military cooperation between Massachusetts and New York on the frontier and for an aborted invasion of Canada.

In 1719, Leverett helped to form the Lincolnshire Company which attempted to develop land in the Muscongus Patent in Maine, then part of Massachusetts. Leverett had inherited a share of this patent from his grandfather John Leverett. Nothing was accomplished and the grant was later taken over by Samuel Waldo, a Boston merchant.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1714.

==Death==
Leverett died in Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on May 3, 1724, at age 61. He is interred in the Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<doc id="782132" wikidata="Q4481121" url="?curid=782132" title="The Fantasticks">
<text>The Fantasticks is a 1960 musical with music by Harvey Schmidt and book and lyrics by Tom Jones. It tells an allegorical story, loosely based on the 1894 play &quot;The Romancers&quot; (&quot;Les Romanesques&quot;) by Edmond Rostand, concerning two neighboring fathers who trick their children, Luisa and Matt, into falling in love by pretending to feud.

The show&#x27;s original off-Broadway production ran a total of 42 years (until 2002) and 17,162 performances, making it the world&#x27;s longest-running musical. The musical was produced by Lore Noto. It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1991. The poetic book and breezy, inventive score, including such memorable songs as &quot;Try to Remember&quot;, helped make the show durable. Many productions followed, as well as television and film versions. &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; has become a staple of regional, community and high school productions since its premiere, with approximately 250 new productions each year. It is played with a small cast, two- to three-person orchestra and minimalist set design.

The show was revived off-Broadway from 2006 to 2017. As of 2010, its original investors had earned 240 times their original investments. The musical has played in all 50 US states and in at least 67 foreign countries.

==Background==
The 1954 Marc Blitzstein adaptation of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, which ran for six years, showed that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of Jerome Kern and P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Leave It to Jane&quot; ran for more than two years. The 1959–1960 off-Broadway season included a dozen musicals and revues including &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, and &quot;Ernest in Love&quot;, a musicalization of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 hit &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

The musical is based loosely on &quot;The Romancers&quot; (&quot;Les Romanesques&quot;) by Edmond Rostand, which draws elements from the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;.

==Productions==
===Early productions===
Jones, together with John Donald Robb of the University of New Mexico, first adapted the Rostand play as a Western titled &quot;Joy Comes to Deadhorse&quot;. The play premiered at the University of New Mexico in the spring of 1956. It was set in the American West, and featured a &quot;half-breed Apache&quot; as the show&#x27;s antagonist. Jones was not happy with this instantiation and subsequently teamed with Schmidt.

The script was substantially rewritten by Jones and Schmidt, with the character of Mortimer now &quot;not really an Indian&quot; but playing one during the &quot;Rape Ballet&quot; sequence. The Wild West setting was abandoned, as was most of the script. All but a few songs in the score were also jettisoned, and the staging of the play was changed to a thrust stage. Tom Jones says that the name of the play came from George Fleming&#x27;s 1900 adaptation of the Rostand play, which used the name &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s book, &quot;On Dramatic Method&quot;, provided the idea of using a series of images to help weave a unifying theme to the play. Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; gave Jones the idea of using a narrator, the staging of Carlo Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;Servant of Two Masters&quot; provided the concept of having actors sit stage-side when not acting, and John Houseman&#x27;s production of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; suggested the use of sun, moon, frozen action, and incidental music. The song &quot;Try to Remember&quot; was added at this time. Harvey Schmidt says he wrote it in a single afternoon, after it emerged in almost complete form after a fruitless afternoon attempting to compose other songs.

The revamped play appeared on a bill of new one-act plays at Barnard College for one week in August 1959.

===Original off-Broadway production===
&quot;The Fantasticks&quot; premiered at the Sullivan Street Playhouse, a small off-Broadway theatre in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, on May 3, 1960, with Jerry Orbach as El Gallo, Rita Gardner as Luisa, Kenneth Nelson as Matt, and librettist Tom Jones (under a pseudonym) as the Old Actor, among the cast members. The sparse set and semicircular stage created an intimate and immediate effect. The play is highly stylized and combines old-fashioned showmanship, classic musical theatre, commedia dell&#x27;arte and Noh theatrical traditions. The original production was directed by Word Baker and was produced on a very low budget. The producer spent $900 on the set and $541 on costumes, at a time when major Broadway shows would cost $250,000. The original set designer, costumer, prop master, and lighting designer was Ed Wittstein, who performed all four jobs for a total of only $480 plus $24.48 a week. The set was similar to that for &quot;Our Town&quot;; Wittstein designed a raised stationary platform anchored by six poles. It resembled a traveling players&#x27; wagon, like a pageant wagon. For a curtain, he hung various small false curtains across the platform at various times during the play. He also made a sun/moon out of cardboard. One side was painted bright yellow (the sun) and the other was black with a crescent of white (the moon). The sun/moon was hung from a nail in one of the poles and is referred to in the libretto. The orchestra consists of a piano and sometimes also a harp, with the harpist also sometimes playing some percussion instruments.

The opening of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; met with mixed reviews. Four years later, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Schmidt and Jones recalled that Noto had kept the show running despite the criticism. The musical was awarded the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1991. 

The production closed on January 13, 2002, after 17,162 performances. It is the world&#x27;s longest-running musical and the longest-running uninterrupted show of any kind in the United States. Other notable actors who appeared in the off-Broadway and touring production throughout its long run included Liza Minnelli, Elliott Gould, F. Murray Abraham, Glenn Close, Keith Charles, Carole Demas, Kristin Chenoweth, Bert Convy, Eileen Fulton, Lore Noto (the show&#x27;s longtime producer), Dick Latessa, and Martin Vidnovic.

===1961, 1969 and 1990 productions===
The musical ran at London&#x27;s Apollo Theatre from September 7, 1961, and ran for 44 performances. In 1990, another production was given in London&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park at the Open Air Theatre there.

It toured in Vietnam in 1969–70, presented by the Command Military Touring Shows, a unit of Army Special Entertainment branch of the US Army Special Services. The company was made up of military personnel.

===Off-Broadway revival===
On August 23, 2006, a revival of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; opened at the off-Broadway The Theater Center, New York City where it closed on June 4, 2017 after an additional run of 4,390 performances. It was directed by lyricist Jones, who also appeared in the role of Henry, The Old Actor, under the stage name Thomas Bruce. The original cast of the revival also included Burke Moses (El Gallo), Leo Burmester (Hucklebee), Martin Vidnovic (Bellomy), Santino Fontana (Matt), Sara Jean Ford (Luisa), Robert R. Oliver (Mortimer), and Douglas Ullman, Jr. (the Mute). A cast recording of this production was released by Ghostlight Records.

Anthony Fedorov played the role of Matt in 2007. Margaret Anne Florence played Luisa in 2008. Lewis Cleale played El Gallo between 2008 and 2010. Jones left the cast in 2010, after the musical had celebrated its 50th anniversary. Pop star Aaron Carter joined the cast as Matt in 2011. In memory of the original El Gallo, the theatre hosting the revival was renamed the Jerry Orbach Theater.

===Washington, D.C. production===
The musical was presented by the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. from November 20, 2009, to January 10, 2010, at the Lincoln Theatre. The well-received production replaced the conventional &quot;mysterious bandit&quot; interpretation of El Gallo with a kindly carnival magician character. &quot;Washington Post&quot; theatre critic Peter Marks wrote, &quot;they have been reconditioned to conceal the telltale signs of age and yield a diversion that feels fresh and alive again&quot;.

===2010 West End production===
&quot;The Fantasticks&quot; played briefly in London&#x27;s West End at the Duchess Theatre, opening on June 9, 2010, following previews from May 24, 2010. The production was directed by Amon Miyamoto, designed by Rumi Matsui with lighting by Rick Fisher, and starred Hadley Fraser as El Gallo, Lorna Want as Luisa, Luke Brady as Matt, Clive Rowe and David Burt as the fathers, Edward Petherbridge as the Old Actor, Paul Hunter as Henry and Carl Au as the mime. The production received mixed to poor reviews: Michael Billington wrote in &quot;the Guardian&quot;, &quot;the time for this kind of faux-naïf, sub Commedia dell&#x27;Arte diversion has passed&quot;, while Paul Tayolr, in &quot;The Independent&quot;, felt that, while &quot;ingratiating [and overly long,] as an open-hearted antidote to soulless, big-budget hi-tech, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; continues to prove that small can be quite fetching&quot;. The production closed on June 26, 2010, two and a half weeks into its run.

===International productions===
&quot;The Fantasticks&quot; has been seen in at least 67 countries, and It has been translated into many languages.

===2014 US national tour===
A non-equity national tour, in a steampunk-inspired version, began at the Rushmore Plaza Civic Center on January 17, 2014.

===Other productions===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; is one of the most widely produced [musicals] in the world, with more than 11,000 productions, by 2010, in 3,000 cities and towns in all 50 states, as well as in 67 countries. &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; has been performed at The White House, for the Peace Corps in Africa, at the Shawnee Methodist Mission in Kansas, the Menninger Foundation, Yellowstone National Park and the White Sands Missile Range. It was performed in Mandarin by the Peking Opera, and in 1990 under the auspices of the United States State Department it played for the first time in Russia. Famous actors, other than those listed above, who have performed in productions of the show include David Canary, Robert Goulet, Richard Chamberlain, John Carradine and Ed Ames.

In 2022, Flint Repertory Theatre in Flint, Michigan, premiered a sex-changed version adapted by Jones and director Michael Lluberes that included LGBT themes; among other things, it changed the female lead, Luisa, to a male character, Lewis, and the fathers became mother characters.

==Television and film==
An abbreviated version of the show was broadcast by the Hallmark Hall of Fame on October 18, 1964. The cast included John Davidson, Stanley Holloway, Bert Lahr, Ricardo Montalbán and Susan Watson, who had appeared in the original Barnard College production. The roles of the old actor and Mortimer were cut for time, and some of their lines were assigned to the fathers, who indulged in some &quot;amateur theatrics&quot;.

A feature film directed by Michael Ritchie was completed in 1995 but not released until 2000. It starred Joel Grey, Brad Sullivan, Jean Louisa Kelly, Barnard Hughes, Jonathon Morris and Joey McIntyre and included some changes to the book. It was both a critical and box office failure.

==Plot==
===Act I===
Two houses are separated by a wall (portrayed by a mute actor) in an unspecified American town.

A mysterious bandit, El Gallo, tells about the kind of September &quot;when love was an ember about to billow&quot; (&quot;Try to Remember&quot;). He begins to narrate the plot of the play. Two young people, Matt and Luisa, live next door to each other and fall in love. However, their fathers are feuding and order them not to speak to each other. Luisa fantasizes about the experiences she wants to have in her life (&quot;Much More&quot;). Matt then delivers a speech about his love for Luisa, calling over the wall to her in a mock literary/heroic way (&quot;Metaphor&quot;). Matt and Luisa climb to the top of the wall and speak secretly of Luisa&#x27;s romantic vision of Matt saving her from kidnapping. Matt&#x27;s father, Mr. Hucklebee, then appears and tells about his philosophy of life and gardening (don&#x27;t over-water). He orders Matt to go inside the house. Luisa&#x27;s father, Mr. Bellomy, arrives and gives a contrasting philosophy of life and gardening (plenty of water). He orders Luisa inside. He then calls to Hucklebee, and the two old friends boast about their cleverness in pretending to feud as a means to ensure that their children fall in love. They note that to manipulate children you need merely to say &quot;no&quot; (&quot;Never Say No&quot;). Hucklebee tells Bellomy of his plan to end the feud by having Luisa &quot;kidnapped&quot; by a professional abductor so that Matt can &quot;rescue&quot; her and appear heroic.

The hired professional, El Gallo, appears and offers the fathers a menu of different varieties of &quot;rape&quot; – in the literary sense of an abduction or kidnapping – that he can simulate (&quot;It Depends on What You Pay&quot;). Deciding to spare no expense for their beloved children (within reason), the fathers agree to a &quot;first class&quot; abduction scene. A disheveled old actor with a failing memory, Henry Albertson, arrives with his sidekick, Mortimer, a Cockney dressed as an American Indian. El Gallo engages them to help with the staged kidnapping. Matt and Luisa return to speak of their love and hint at physical intimacy (&quot;Soon It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;). El Gallo and the actors burst in and carry out the moonlit abduction scenario; Matt &quot;defeats&quot; the three (&quot;Rape Ballet&quot;). The feud is ended and the wall between the houses torn down, with the children and the fathers joined in a picturesque final tableau (&quot;Happy Ending&quot;). El Gallo collects the stage properties used in the &quot;abduction&quot; and wonders aloud how long the lovers and their fathers will be able to maintain their elaborately joyful poses. He and The Mute leave.

===Act II===
The children and fathers are discovered in the same poses but are visibly exhausted by the effort. El Gallo observes that what seemed romantic by moonlight may lose its charm when exposed to the harsh light of day. He exchanges his moon for a blazing sun. The fathers and lovers begin to complain about one another, noticing all the flaws that have become glaringly visible by daylight (&quot;This Plum Is Too Ripe&quot;). The children try to recreate their romantic mood from the previous night and mock their fathers. Eventually, in a fit of pique, Hucklebee reveals that the kidnapping and the feud were fake. Matt and Luisa are mortified, and the fathers&#x27; mutual recrimination quickly escalates into a real feud; they storm off to their respective houses. Matt sees El Gallo and, in a desperate attempt to regain his honor and Luisa&#x27;s love, challenges him to a duel. El Gallo easily disarms Matt and leaves him embarrassed. Matt and Luisa then argue; she calls him a poseur, while he calls her childish.

Matt is eager to leave the provincial town. He and El Gallo discuss his gleaming vision of adventure (&quot;I Can See It&quot;). Henry and Mortimer return and lead Matt off to see the world. A month passes, and the fathers have rebuilt the wall. They meet and speak sadly of their children; Luisa is like a statue and does nothing but sit and dream; Matt still hasn&#x27;t returned. They then sing about the uncertainties of raising children, as compared with the reliability of vegetable gardening (&quot;Plant a Radish&quot;). Luisa sees El Gallo watching her and is intrigued by the handsome, experienced bandit. Impulsively, she asks him to take her away to see the world. In a long fantasy sequence, they preview a series of romantic adventures through a mask of unreality, while in the background Matt is being abused and beaten by Henry and Mortimer portraying a series of unpleasant exotic employers. Luisa&#x27;s fantasies become increasingly frenzied, exhausting and darkly underscored (&quot;Round and Round&quot;).

El Gallo tells Luisa to pack her things for the journey, but before she goes inside to do so, he asks her to give him her treasured necklace, a relic of her dead mother, as a pledge that she will return. As she goes inside, El Gallo promises her a world of beauty and grandeur; at the same time, Matt approaches, giving a contrasting version of the cruel experiences that one can suffer (&quot;I Can See It&quot; (reprise)). As Luisa disappears, El Gallo turns to leave, the injured Matt makes a pitiful attempt to stop him from hurting Luisa, but El Gallo knocks him away and disappears. Luisa returns to find that El Gallo has left with her necklace, and she sits in tears. El Gallo, as the narrator, explains poetically that he had to hurt Matt and Luisa, and also himself in the process. Matt comforts Luisa, and he tells her a little about his experiences, and the two realize that everything they wanted was each other (&quot;They Were You&quot;; &quot;Metaphor&quot; (reprise)), but that they now understand that more deeply. The Fathers return joyfully and are about to tear down the wall, when El Gallo reminds them that the wall must always remain (&quot;Try to Remember&quot; (reprise)).

==Controversy==
After the initial success of the musical, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; came under criticism for the repeated use of the word &quot;rape&quot; in the scene preceding the song &quot;It Depends on What You Pay&quot; and in the lyrics of the song. In the original production, when El Gallo offers to stage the phony kidnapping of Luisa, he refers to the proposed event as a &quot;rape&quot;, although he states that he uses the word in its literary sense of &quot;abduction&quot;, noting that classical works such as Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; use the word in this sense. (See &quot;raptio&quot; and bride kidnapping.) In his song &quot;It Depends on What You Pay&quot; he describes different kidnapping scenarios, some comic or outlandish, that he classifies as the &quot;Venetian rape&quot;, the &quot;Gothic rape&quot;, the &quot;Drunken rape&quot;, etc. However, as women’s rights advocates began drawing attention to rape and sexual assault in the US during the play&#x27;s long run, many audience members objected to the repeated use of the word, arguing that it minimizes the damage to women and families caused by sexual crimes.

To deal with changing audience perceptions, the musical&#x27;s book is usually edited to replace the word &quot;rape&quot;, in most instances, with alternatives such as &quot;abduction&quot; and the similar-sounding &quot;raid&quot;. In 1990, Jones and Schmidt wrote an optional replacement piece called &quot;Abductions&quot;, which uses the music of the &quot;Rape Ballet&quot;, although this song did not replace &quot;It Depends on What You Pay&quot; at the Sullivan Street Playhouse, where, with the edits made in the book, audiences accepted the song. An edited version of &quot;It Depends on What You Pay&quot; was used in the long-running Jerry Orbach Theater version of the show. MTI (Music Theater International), which licenses the show, offers &quot;Abductions&quot; as an alternative choice.
