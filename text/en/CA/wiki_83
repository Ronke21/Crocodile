In 1989, he reached number two in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Love Changes Everything&quot;, from the musical &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;, where he played Alex Dillingham. He played the role in the West End and on Broadway. His album &quot;Coming Home To You&quot; reached number one in the UK making it his 4th number one album to date. On 24 April 2020, Ball and Captain Tom Moore entered the UK Singles Chart at number one with a cover of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, with combined chart sales of 82,000 making it the fastest-selling single of 2020.

Ball was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours for his services to musical theatre.

==Early life==
Ball was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to a Welsh mother and an English father. His father Tony, who originally wanted to be an actor, trained as an Austin apprentice at the Longbridge plant and progressed to become head of global sales at British Leyland. He was awarded an MBE for services to industry. Ball&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a coal miner. Ball has a brother, Kevin, four years his senior and a sister, Katherine, almost a decade his junior. He moved to Dartmoor with his parents when he was three years old. He has never had singing lessons, but as a boy he learned to sing by singing along to music, for example; songs by Ella Fitzgerald, Mahalia Jackson and Frank Sinatra. When he was 11 years old he went to Plymouth College, an independent boarding school, because his parents thought this would give him a good education. However this made him unhappy, as he did not fit into the academic and sporting environment at the school at that time. He did join his fellow junior boarders on Sunday morning at the Pathfinder bible group in St Andrew&#x27;s church. One summer he went to Pathfinder camp on the isle of Jersey.

Ball was interested in the theatre and his father took him to see shows in the school holidays, including a Royal Shakespeare Company production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre of &quot;King Lear&quot;, which impressed him as a youngster of about 14 years&#x27; age. He joined a youth theatre, which led to his studying drama at Guildford School of Acting, where he found an environment that suited him. As a student he went busking on Saturdays in Guildford town with a female student friend to earn a little extra money. He graduated in 1984. After his graduation, Ball&#x27;s singing career rapidly got off the ground. His maternal grandmother, having a musical ear, was proud of Ball&#x27;s early singing achievements; she died suddenly, however, of a heart attack about one week before his debut in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

==Theatre==
In 1984, after he had left drama school, Ball&#x27;s first part was in &quot;Godspell&quot; at Aberystwyth Arts Centre, after which he worked for a few months in rep in Basingstoke, but his first major break was a star part in the production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; at Manchester Opera House; at an open audition he was selected from about 600 applicants who formed a queue to do singing, acting, and dancing interviews, which were held in three separate rooms. His next important role came when Cameron Mackintosh cast him as Marius in the original London cast of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, but he caught glandular fever and he took six or seven weeks off sick to recover from the associated tonsillitis and post-viral fatigue. When he returned to work he was still suffering from fatigue, and began to get on-stage panic attacks — overwhelming anxiety, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and problems with vision. These also started happening at other times, such as when he was going to work. For most of the next nine months he lived alone in his flat feeling depressed; he did not seek therapy and left &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

Thames Television invited Ball to sing during the Miss England contest, a live televised event, and he sang well enough despite suffering from anxiety. When he viewed a recording later, he realised that no one would have noticed how nervous he was, and he became less worried about his anxiety problem. At about that time, Cameron Mackintosh asked Ball to play Raoul in the second casting of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in London, which was necessary after Michael Crawford (who played the Phantom) and Steve Barton (who played Raoul) left the London show to appear in the Broadway staging in New York City. Mackintosh thought that Ball would not be under too much pressure as Raoul, and that the part was right for him.

Ball played Alex in &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;, both in London and New York, and Giorgio in the London production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Passion&quot;. &quot;Alone Together&quot; was his one-man show first performed at the Donmar Warehouse (which was reprised in 2004 for the &quot;Singular Sensations&quot; season at the Haymarket). In 1998 Ball performed at three big concerts: &quot;The Fiftieth Birthday Concert of Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall (released on DVD), &quot;Sondheim Tonight&quot; at the Barbican Centre (released on CD) and &quot;Hey, Mr. Producer: The Musical World of Cameron Mackintosh&quot; (released on CD and DVD). In 2002 he took on the role of Caractacus Potts in the Sherman Brothers musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, which was largely considered his comeback role.

In 2004, he co-starred with Petula Clark in a production of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; at the Cork Opera House, later broadcast by the BBC. Later the same year he was a guest star at Clark&#x27;s Concert, also broadcast by the BBC. He sang three tracks from his latest album, &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;; &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;One Voice&quot;, as well as two duets with Clark. Other performances include singing at the BBC&#x27;s St David&#x27;s Day concert, in the role of Marius at the &quot;Les Misérables: The Dream Cast in Concert&quot;, the tenth anniversary concert of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in 1995. A lyric baritone, Ball also sang the role of Valjean at a special concert performance of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; for the Queen and her guests at Windsor Castle in 2004. In 2005, with 10 days&#x27; notice, he replaced Michael Crawford as Count Fosco in &quot;The Woman in White&quot; after poor health forced Crawford to give up the role.

In November 2005, Ball returned to Broadway as Count Fosco in &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, which transferred from London&#x27;s West End. He was, however, forced to leave the show because of a viral infection supposedly caused by the fat suit required for the role; this reportedly raised Ball&#x27;s body temperature by several degrees during the show.

In September 2005, Ball made his New York City Opera debut as Reginald Bunthorne in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot;. He spent the first quarter of 2006 on complete vocal rest, following the illness that caused him to leave &quot;The Woman in White&quot; on Broadway. By the middle of July, Ball had taken part in the Royal Court Theatre&#x27;s celebratory performance of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. He took a leading role in &quot;Kismet&quot; in June and July 2007 for the ENO, and appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; on 22 June 2007 to promote this production. He then appeared as the solo artist in a controversial &#x27;Musical Theatre&#x27; Prom on 27 August 2007 for the BBC at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. Ball performed a wide range of musical theatre numbers, including several by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The show was broadcast live on BBC Four, as well as on BBC Radio 3.

From October 2007 – July 2009, Ball made his West End return starring as Edna Turnblad in the hit musical &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London. In March 2008, he was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal. He also won the Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Edna Turnblad. He recently starred in a new production of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre in the West End, alongside Imelda Staunton as Mrs. Lovett. The show premiered at the Chichester Festival Theatre for six weeks starting 24 September 2011 before transferring to London in March 2012. Michael and Imelda were both awarded Olivier awards, best actor and best actress in a musical for their Sweeney Todd performances. Ball starred as Mack in Mack and Mabel, which toured the UK in 2015.

In 2018, he starred as Anatoly Sergievsky in the West End revival of Sir Tim Rice’s &quot;Chess&quot; at the London Coliseum. His co-stars included Tim Howar, Cassidy Janson, and Alexandra Burke.

It was announced in February 2019 that Ball will star as Inspector Javert opposite Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean) in a staged concert production of Les Misérables. The production will open on 10 August 2019, at the Gielgud Theatre and serve as a placeholder while the original West End production of Les Mis at the Queen&#x27;s Theater is replaced with Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s new staging of the show at the renamed Sondheim theatre. The staged concert was broadcast live to cinemas in the UK on 2 December 2019, and then encore showings in the UK and the USA. This staged concert has become the highest live stream concert at cinemas in UK history.
The live stream also became available as a DVD and CD in early 2020. The concert was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on the 5 January 2020.

In 2021, Ball reprised his role as Edna Turnblad in a revival of &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the London Coliseum, which opened in June of that year. In 2023, he played George Dillingham in a revival of &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; at the Lyric Theatre. In 2024, he reprised the role of Javert in &quot;Les Misérables: The Arena Spectacular World Tour&quot;.

==Recording work==
Ball is a concert artist: he tours frequently around the United Kingdom and has also performed concerts in Australia and the United States. He has also had success in the charts with his recording work. Since reaching Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Love Changes Everything&quot; from &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;, Ball had lesser success with follow up singles, but in the main has concentrated on releasing albums, all of which achieved gold status within weeks, and in the case of &quot;The Movies&quot; album in 1998, platinum in seven weeks (released 26 October, confirmed platinum status on 12 December).

Ball represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest 1992 held in Malmö, Sweden, singing the song &quot;One Step Out of Time&quot;, which finished second. The single reached number 20 in the UK, while an eponymous album released in the same year reached number 1. This began a run of top 20 albums released over the next two decades. In July 2006, Ball was a guest artist on Julian Lloyd Webber&#x27;s album &quot;Unexpected Songs&quot; and in November of that year released a DVD containing all the best songs from his &quot;Live in Concert&quot; DVDs. This is split into five sections: Musicals, Love Songs, Personal Favourites, Party Time, and Unplugged. The DVD also included a brand new &quot;Unplugged&quot; session which Ball recorded especially with four other musicians in the studio. It was released on 20 November 2006. Ball took part in many promotional activities at the end of the 2006 to coincide with the release of his album &quot;One Voice&quot;. This involved singing the song &quot;Home&quot; on ITV&#x27;s GMTV, &quot;This Morning&quot;, and the BBC One programme &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot;, hosted by Gloria Hunniford.

A new compilation album entitled &quot;Michael Ball: The Silver Collection&quot; was released in July 2007, along with the DVD version of his 1995 film &quot;England My England&quot;. Towards the end of 2007, Ball recorded his 15th solo album for release on 15 October of that year. The album features songs all written by Burt Bacharach and is entitled &quot;Back to Bacharach&quot;. It was released along with a performance DVD of his 2007 tour, &quot;One Voice Live&quot;, filmed at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo. Promotional activities took place throughout October and November 2007 for these releases including appearances on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

In February 2013, Ball released his album &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; featuring the song &quot;Fight the Fight&quot; from Tim Rice&#x27;s new musical From Here to Eternity.

In November 2014, Ball released his new album, &quot;If Everyone Was Listening&quot;. In March 2019, he released the album &quot;Coming Home To You&quot;. The album reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and, although Ball has had many hits, this is his first solo number one selling album in 26 years.

He has recorded three albums with Alfie Boe. Two reached number 1; &quot;Ball &amp; Boe: Together&quot; in 2016 and &quot;Ball &amp; Boe: Together Again&quot; in 2017. Their third album, &quot;Ball &amp; Boe: Back Together in 2019&quot; reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart.

In April 2020, Ball recorded a duet with 99 year old World War II veteran Captain Tom Moore, in aid of the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their cover of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 24 April, not only giving Ball his first chart-topping single at the age of 57, but also making Moore the oldest ever person in history to score a number one hit.

==Television==
As an actor, Ball briefly appeared as Malcolm Nuttall in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1985. Ball has also turned his hand to presenting both on TV and radio. Ball had his own TV series, &quot;Michael Ball&quot;, in 1993 and 1994 a Christmas Special in 1995 and a three-part series in 1998 filmed by BBC Cymru Wales &quot;Ball in the Hall&quot;. These three episodes were combined to make a special which was then broadcast on BBC One. Ball has presented &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot; and &quot;Children in Need&quot;. He guest presented &quot;This Morning&quot; for a short period.

On 3 January 2014, BBC Four broadcast a special tribute programme to the lyricist Don Black called &quot;Diamonds are Forever: A tribute to Don Black&quot; which took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Ball sang two songs on this show; the first was the song Born Free, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and was a hit for the British male singer Matt Monro in 1966. Black wrote the lyrics for this song and the music was composed by John Barry for the film of the same name, Born Free. The second song Ball sang during the programme was Love Changes Everything, a song that Black co-wrote with lyricist Charles Hart for the musical &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. This song was released as a single by Ball in 1989 and stayed in the British pop charts for fourteen weeks. The BBC Concert Orchestra provided the orchestral backing for Ball on both songs for this performance.

On 26 December 2014, Ball starred in Victoria Wood&#x27;s musical &quot;That Day We Sang&quot;, reuniting him with his &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; co-star Imelda Staunton.

Talking to the Official Charts Company, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s the most exciting news! Thank you so much for supporting the album, to the fans who&#x27;ve connected with it and bought it. The hard work has been worth it and this is just the icing on the cake. Amazing!&quot;.

===&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;===
In April 2020, to mark 99-year old Captain Tom Moore completing the first phase of his fundraising walk during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ball sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; for him live on &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;. Within 24 hours, the performance was recorded, and made into a digital single featuring the NHS Voices of Care Choir, and Moore&#x27;s spoken words. Released by Decca Records, with all proceeds going to NHS Charities Together, the recording went straight to number one in the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;The Official Big Top 40&quot; chart. It sold almost 36,000 copies in its first 48 hours, and was &quot;biggest trending song&quot; as measured by the Official Charts Company. On 24 April, it became No. 1 in the weekly &quot;Official&quot; UK Singles Chart, making Moore the oldest person to achieve that position and meaning that he will be at No. 1 on his 100th birthday.

==Personal life==

<text>Abraham Sapien, born Langdon Everett Caul, is a fictional character in the comic book series &quot;Hellboy&quot;, created by Mike Mignola. He takes his name from &quot;Ichthyo sapien&quot;, the fanciful species designation chosen for him by his colleagues in the 19th-century Oannes Club, and from Abraham Lincoln, on whose assassination date the Oannes Club abandoned Abe&#x27;s body in a suspended animation tank beneath a Washington D.C. hospital, leaving only a cryptic note as explanation. He is occasionally referred to as an &quot;amphibious man.&quot;

In addition to his regular appearances in &quot;Hellboy&quot; and &quot;B.P.R.D.&quot;, Sapien has also starred in his own comics, with trade paperback collections and omnibus editions including &quot;The Drowning&quot;, &quot;The Devil Does Not Jest and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;Dark and Terrible&quot; and &quot;Lost Lives and Other Stories&quot;.

==Fictional biography==
Sapien began his life as Langdon Everett Caul, a Victorian scientist and businessman who became involved with the Oannes Society, an occult organization who believed in life and all knowledge having come from the sea. After retrieving a strange jellyfish-like deity from an underwater ruin, Caul and the other members performed an arcane ritual that inadvertently ended with the creature&#x27;s release and Caul being turned into an &quot;ichthyo sapien&quot;. Believing him to be Oannes reborn, the society sealed the developing icthyo sapien&#x27;s body in a tube of water in the hidden laboratory beneath a Washington, D.C. hospital until such time as he was fully formed. Forced to abandon the site by the outbreak of the American Civil War, the Society never found occasion to return for Caul, and there he stayed until he was found by workmen in November 1978.

With no memory of his life before, the icthyo sapien received a new name from a piece of paper attached to the tube, dated the day of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination (April 14, 1865). Abe Sapien was taken to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) for a grueling round of research by curious BPRD scientists and was saved from vivisection by an empathetic Hellboy. Thereafter, Abe entered the ranks of the BPRD as a valued field agent, embarking on his first mission with Hellboy in 1979.

At Cavendish Hall, during the climax of &quot;Seed of Destruction&quot;, Sapien was possessed by the spirit of long-dead whaler Elihu Cavendish. Cavendish was a contemporary of Langdon Caul, who killed the mad monk Rasputin, foiling his plans to unleash the Ogdru Jahad to destroy the world. During the subsequent &quot;Girescu affair&quot; during &quot;Wake the Devil&quot;, Abe and a fellow agent were led into a trap which left the agent dead and Abe with a broken arm. Rasputin&#x27;s vengeful spirit appeared before him and prophesied that Sapien will one day be speared to death.

In &quot;Plague of Frogs&quot;, Rasputin&#x27;s prediction came true when Sapien was impaled by a spear and apparently killed by one of the Ogdru Jahad&#x27;s followers. Sapien appeared to die and had an out of body experience that brought him to his former life in antebellum America. Witnessing his past self&#x27;s actions, Abe entered Caul&#x27;s body prior to his transformation, creating a spiritual/mystical time loop before Abe returned to live in the present, where he made a fast recovery and began to do research into his past life. As a result, Abe learns of Edith Howard, Langdon Caul&#x27;s wife, who drowned herself out of madness. She had become a specter, who was finally exorcized after she attempts to have Sapien resume his life as Caul.

In &quot;Garden of Souls&quot;, Sapien was contacted by Panya, an ageless mummy trapped by the Oannes Society. Members of the society were sequestered away on a hidden island in Indonesia, their now-withered psychic forms contained in cyborg bodies. Aware of the imminent apocalypse, the society was determined to save at least some of mankind&#x27;s spiritual essence, and were poised to use bombs to cause massive tidal waves which would devastate the southern hemisphere. The souls of those killed could then be harvested by the Society in vat-grown bodies made expressly for the purpose, granting them god-like powers. Horrified, Abe managed to single-handedly destroy the society and escape with Panya, and in so doing finally came to terms with the ghosts of his past; he was truly a separate identity from Langdon Caul, who would likely have agreed willingly to the society&#x27;s plan. Abe has since fully returned to the BPRD and continues to be one of the most trustworthy agents.

However, in &quot;King of Fear&quot;, Abe led a return mission into the Hyperborean underworld and was confronted by the supervillain the Black Flame, who had gathered a vast army of frogs and Hyperboreans to usher in the apocalypse. The Flame revealed that &quot;Abe&quot; was going to be the epicenter of this new Earth and that he was a fully evolved version of the frog monsters: one of the New Men first mentioned in &quot;Hellboy: Conqueror Worm&quot; by Rasputin. While Abe rejected the idea, many of the BPRD field agents are now wary of him, most notably Andrew Devon; in &quot;New World&quot;, there is visible tension between Devon and Abe implying that Devon thinks Abe should be much more closely monitored. A vision of the future in &quot;King of Fear&quot; by Liz Sherman showed that, by that time, Abe will have a more monstrous form.

In &quot;Gods&quot;, Abe was shot by a psychic girl named Fénix, in whom the BPRD has shown interest. According to Professor O&#x27;Donnell, Fénix is equal to the ancient Hyperborean shamans who keep the Ogdru Hem for entering in Earth after Hyperborea&#x27;s fall using the Vril energy. Fénix says, before shooting Abe, that she knows &quot;who&quot; he is, implying that she figured Abe&#x27;s condition as an evolved form of the frog monsters. Abe is last seen in a helicopter, being treated for his bullet wounds. Devon witnesses the shooting, but lies when asked regarding it later.

In &quot;Monsters&quot;, it is revealed that Abe&#x27;s condition in the BPRD headquarters suddenly worsened, and, despite putting him on life support to keep his body alive, he suffered extensive brain damage. His doctors declared him brain dead. However, he miraculously recovered, but began mutating further: he grew taller, his limbs and neck lengthening, and his nose receded, all while he was comatose. Abe eventually awakened, discovered his transformation, and stumbled into the empty monitor room, to discover the world in apocalypse while he was out. Panya confronted Abe, telling him what happened and that Hellboy has died. Taking Panya&#x27;s advice, Abe fled the BPRD, stealing a truck, to go out on his own and discover if he is involved in the apocalypse. Kate Corrigan, highly desiring her friend&#x27;s return, sends agents to bring him home but eventually give in due to more pressing matters.

In the Abe Sapien series, Abe traveled through the US on a quest to prove he was not part of the apocalypse and avoid the BPRD (fearing death and dissection from Devon&#x27;s influence), first travelling to the Salton Sea to inspect the Ogdru Hem there, then back to Texas where he was shot and finally to the undersea temple where Langdon Caul found the relic that transformed him. Because of his appearance and heroism, Abe was seen as something as prophet in a growing religion humanity was creating to deal with the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;. Abe although was not the only one looking into his origin, Gustav Strobl was magically weakened due to the turmoil in hell caused by Hellboy and became desperate and disillusioned by the fact it was nearly the end of everything and he didn&#x27;t have significant part to play. Sensing Abe was important, both men the Black Flame was partially telling the truth. Abe was the &quot;Adam&quot; of the race of man to replace the old after the apocalypse but not instrumental in it and most of all not connected to the Ogdru Jahad and the frogs. Abe was psychically contacted by Shonchin, who revealed that the jellyfish entity was an ancient hyperborean shaman of the right hand, who transcended to that form after being martyred by worshipers of the black goddess. This revelation finally confirmed to Abe that he was a gestalt of the shaman and Caul (a combination of hyperborean and man), destined to usher the next race of man, a amphibious race with a connection and innate knowledge of the Vril.
In &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, following the destruction of the Ogdru Hem, the apocalypse resumed after the destruction of a powerful demon when Rasputin was brought back to the physical world, revealed to have become host to the power of the destroyed Ogdru Jahad&#x27;s power. He was confronted by Abe, Liz and the recently resurrected Hellboy in the streets of New York, where Abe was quickly killed by Rasputin breaking his back. Abe&#x27;s body fell to the bottom of the river, where Ichthyoplankton flowed out of a wound across his chest. After Hellboy killed Rasputin at the cost of his own life, his and Hecate&#x27;s spirits called upon Liz to cleanse the damaged Earth of the Ogdru Jahad&#x27;s corruption, releasing her full power, reducing the earths surface to a smoking cinder so Hellboy could enter Hecate (as an iron maiden) and his blood remade the world anew. Abe&#x27;s spawn survived Liz&#x27;s cleansing and left the sea to occupy the land where they found Liz in a hyperborean crystal.

==Powers and abilities==
* Amphibious physiology: Abe can breathe underwater and swim at a great speed. 
* Excellent marksman and hand-to-hand combatant. 
* Possibly immortal: Abe is exactly 220 years old and technically died twice only to come back to life, also survived numerous wounds that would be fatal to humans.

With his second transformation to his current form, Abe&#x27;s strength, agility, and speed has significantly increased, performing feats never seen before by him. His speed is at its peak underwater. Lately, by his own admission, Abe has been having an intuition of danger, always knowing something bad is going on before it happens with little to no proof.
In the films, he displays a genius-level intelligence, and has psychic intuition, making him adept at telepathy and psychometry. However, his strength is not increased, while he has superhuman speed underwater. He is also capable of surviving wounds that would be fatal to humans.

==Publication history==

===Issues===
&quot;Abe Sapien&quot; had an internal numbering on the inside cover from its second issue onwards. When the series became an ongoing series in 2013, an ongoing numbering was present on the cover, which reset back 1. However, the internal numbering is still present on the inside cover.
===Collected editions===

====Trade paperbacks====
====Omnibus editions====
==In other media==
===Films===

====&quot;Hellboy&quot; (2004)====
In the 2004 film adaptation, &quot;Hellboy&quot;, Sapien is portrayed by Doug Jones, and voiced by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce who refused credit out of respect for Jones&#x27;s performance. This version of Abe has a dolphin-like frontal lobe that enables him to transmit and receive electro-psychic information in the same way that cetaceans use sonar. He also has an encyclopedic knowledge of the occult and holds paranormal expertise rivaled only by Professor Bruttenholm. Additionally, he is unable to survive out of water for long periods without a collar-like apparatus that provides water to his gills.

====&quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (2008)====
Sapien appeared in the film&#x27;s 2008 sequel, &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, in which he was played by Doug Jones who provides his speaking parts. He doesn&#x27;t wear his breathing apparatus as much in this film, and he shows his marksman skills in the film. He is also the one who discovers Liz&#x27;s pregnancy in the mission where Hellboy is revealed to the world. He falls in love with the elf Princess Nuala, which leads to his helping Prince Nuada by giving him the magical crown piece (to control the Golden Army) for her safety, but Princess Nuala kills herself to prevent Nuada from killing Hellboy. While mourning her loss, he decides to follow Liz and Hellboy in leaving the B.P.R.D.

====&quot;Hellboy&quot; (2019)====
In the 2019 reboot film &quot;Hellboy&quot;, Abe appears on the final scene of the film having been discovered by Hellboy, Alice and Daimio inside his stasis tank which is located on a secret facility in the middle of Siberia.

===Animation===
Abe Sapien is one of the characters appearing in two straight-to-DVD &quot;Hellboy Animated&quot; films, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, in which he is voiced by Doug Jones. This version of the character, although similar to the movie Sapien, is much more like his comic book counterpart, showing signs of neither the psychic abilities nor breathing apparatus. However, he is far faster, more agile and stronger than humans in the films, allowing him to fight giant creatures that only Hellboy is thought to be strong enough to fight.

===Video games===
Abe is a playable character in &quot;&quot; with Doug Jones reprising his role.

<text>The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are a group of Śvētāmbara Jain temples located about kilometres from the Mount Abu settlement in Sirohi District, Rajasthan&#x27;s only hill station. The earliest were built by Vimal Shah , a Jain minister of Solanki king of Gurjaratra , Bhima I and additions to the temples were made by Vastupala, Jain minister of Vaghelas of Gurjaratra. They date between the 11th and 16th centuries, forming some of the most famous monuments in the style of Solanki architecture, famous for their use of a very pure white marble and intricate marble carvings. They are managed by Seth Shri Kalyanji Anandji Pedhi, Sirohi and are a pilgrimage place for Jains, and a significant general tourist attraction. The Dilwara temples are regarded as the most impressive among Jain temples in Rajasthan.

== Architecture ==

The five Dilwara temples are among the most famous Jain temples. The Vimal Vasahi is much the earliest, constructed by 1031, with the Luna Vasahi by 1230, and the others at intervals between 1459 and 1582. All are in white marble which adds greatly to their effect and remains in use. The oldest and largest two have large amounts of intricate carving even by the standards of the style, reaching a peak in the Luna Vasahi temple. The main buildings of the first three named are surrounded by &quot;cloister&quot; screens of &quot;devakulikā&quot; shrines, and are fairly plain on the outer walls of these; in the case of the Vimal Vasahi this screen was a later addition, around the time of the second temple. These three have an axis from the sanctuary through a closed, then an open mandapa to an open &quot;rangamandapa&quot;, or larger hall for dance or drama. Surrounding the main temple with a curtain of shrines was to become a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples.

In later temples in the Māru-Gurjara style, a very pure white marble like that at Dilwara came to be regarded as highly desirable, even essential. In modern times, when the style has become popular in other regions of India, and with Hindu and Jain communities in other countries, local Rajastani marble is often carved and transported to the new building.

The temples have an opulent entranceway, the simplicity in architecture reflecting Jain values like honesty and frugality. The ornamental detail spreading over the minutely carved ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels is considered to be remarkable. It is said that workmen were paid in gold according to the weight of marble powder scraped off.

== Five Temples ==
The temple complex is in the midst of a range of forested hills. There are five temples in all, each with its own unique identity. All the five temples are enclosed within a single high walled compound. The group is named after the small village of Dilwara or Delvara in which they are located. The five temples are:
# Vimal Vasahi, dedicated to the 1st tirthankara, Rishabhanatha (Adinatha).
# Luna Vasahi, dedicated to the 22nd tirthankara, Neminatha.
# Pittalhar temple, dedicated to Adinatha.
# Parshvanath temple, dedicated to the 23rd tirthankara, Parshvanatha.
# Mahavir Swami temple, dedicated to the 24th tirthankara, Mahavira.

Among the five marble temples of Dilwara, the most famous are the Vimal Vasahi and the Luna Vasahi temples. Dilwara Temples along with Ashtapad, Girnar, Shatrunjaya and Shikharji are known as Śvētāmbara &quot;Pancha Tirth&quot; (five principal pilgrimage shrine).

=== Vimal Vasahi Temple ===
The Adinatha or Vimala Vasahi Temple is carved entirely out of white marble and was mostly built in 1026 by Vimal Shah, a minister of Bhima I, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. The outer mandapa is an addition of the next century. The temple is dedicated to Rishabhanatha. The temple stands in an open courtyard surrounded by a corridor, which has numerous cells containing smaller idols of the tirthankaras. The richly carved corridors, pillars, arches, and &#x27;mandaps&#x27; or porticoes of the temple are simply amazing.

The ceilings feature engraved designs of lotus-buds, petals, flowers and scenes from Jain mythology. The figures of animal life, life journey from dream to incarnation of tirthankars are carved. There are 59 devakulikas (small shrine) facing the main image of Rishabhanatha. There are 7 additional cells are found, 1 cell houses image of Ambika and 2 cells of Munisuvrata. The mulnayak idol of Rishabhanatha is carved with attendant deities and images of 4 tirthankaras, giving the idol name &quot;Saparikar Panchtirthi&quot;. The principal shrine was originally surrounded by 24 sub-shrines but later 74 shub-shrines were added in the 12th century.

The Navchowki is a collection of nine rectangular ceilings, each containing carvings of different designs supported on ornate pillars. The Gudh mandap is a simple hall after stepping inside its heavily decorated doorway. The Gudh mandap, houses two idols of Parshvanatha in Kayotsarga position, and an image of Rishabhanatha. The mandap is meant for Aarti to the deity. The ceiling has carvings of horses, elephants, musician, dancers and soldier. The ceiling of the main dome features carving of the sixteen devis associated with learning.

The Hastishala (Elephant courtyard) was constructed by Prithvipal, a descendant of Vimal Shah in 1147-49 and features a row of elephants in sculpture with the members of the family riding them.

=== Luna Vasahi ===
The Luna Vasahi or Neminatha temple is dedicated to Neminatha. The temple was built in 1230 by two Porwad brothers - Vastupal and Tejpal - both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat. The temple, built in memory of Vastupal &amp; Tejpal&#x27;s late brother Lunig, was designed after the Vimal Vashi temple. The temple has a similar structure as Vimala Vasahi but has better carvings. The &quot;Rang mandap&quot; (main hall) features a central dome from which hangs a big ornamental pendant. Arranged in a circular band are 72 figures of tirthankaras in sitting posture; under this band are 360 small figures of Jain monks in another circular band. The &quot;Hathishala&quot; (elephant cell) features 10 marble elephants, polished and realistically modelled. A special feature of the temple is the two niches of &quot;Derani&quot; (wife of younger brother) and &quot;Jethani&quot; (wife of older brother), the wives of Vastupal and Tejpal respectively. The niches have the image of the goddess Lakshmi with sculptures of tirthankaras Sambhavanatha and Shantinatha respectively.

There are 47 sub-shrines housing one or more images of tirthankaras. The first shrine houses an idol of the goddess Ambika. The ninth and eleventh enshrines images of Neminatha&#x27;s life after renunciation and Neminatha&#x27;s marriage respectively. The fourteenth shrine has images of the life events of Shantinatha. In the thirty-seventh shrine, there are images of four goddesses. There are several images of life events of Krishna as well. There are a total of 130 pillars in the temple of which 38 are beautifully carved.

The &quot;Navchowki&quot; features some of the most delicate marble stone cutting work of the temple. The ceilings of the temple depicts scenes of the life of Neminatha with image of &quot;Rajmathi&quot; (who was to marry Neminatha) and Krishna. The &quot;Gudh mandap&quot; features a black marble idol of Neminatha. The carvings of &quot;devkulikas&quot; and Chakreshvari in the ceiling of temple are also noteworthy. The &quot;Kirti Stambha&quot;(pillar of pride), big black stone pillar on the left of the temple, was constructed by Maharana Kumbha of Mewar. The remaining three temples of Dilwara are smaller.

=== Pittalhar Temple ===

The Pittalhar temple, also called the Adinatha temple, was built by Bhima Shah, a minister of Sultan Begada of Ahmedabad, between 1316-1432 AD. A massive metal statue of Rishabhanatha (Adinatha), cast in five metals, is installed in the temple. The main metal used in this statue is &#x27;Pital&#x27; (brass), hence the name &#x27;Pittalhar&#x27;. The name of the temple is also mentioned in an inscription dating back to 1432, found in Digambar shrine in Dilwara complex.

There are 107 images in the main shrine. The shrine consists of a &quot;Garbhagriha&quot;, &quot;Gudh mandap&quot; and &quot;Navchowki&quot; with images of yakshi Chakreshvari and yaksha Gomukha on both sides. It seems that the construction of &quot;Rangmandap&quot; and the corridor was left unfinished. The old mutilated idol was replaced and installed in 1468-69 AD weighing 108 maunds (four metric tons) according to the inscription on it. The image was cast by an artist &#x27;Deta&#x27; which is . high, . broad and the figure is in height. In &quot;Gudh Mandap&quot; on one side, a big marble &quot;Panch-Tirthi&quot; sculpture of Rishabhanatha is installed. Some shrines (&quot;devakulika&quot;) were constructed in 1474 and 1490, before construction was abandoned.

=== Parshvanatha Temple ===

This temple, dedicated to Parshvanatha, was built by Sangvi Mandlik and his family in 1458–59. According to popular belief, masons offered free remaining stones of &quot;Vimala Vasahi&quot; and &quot;Luna Vasahi&quot; to add marble since the temple was built of grey stone. This three-storey building is the tallest temple in Dilwara. Not all the tower remains. On all four faces of the sanctum on the ground floor are four big mandapas housing a Chaumukha idol of Parshvanatha. On the first floor, the Chaumukha idol the front iconography is of &quot;Chintamani Parshvanath&quot;, second &quot;Magalakar Parshvanatha&quot; and third &quot;Manoratha-Kalpadruma Parshvanatha&quot; all are depicted with hood of nine cobras. The image of fourth image of Parshvanatha is illegible. In the corridor there are images of 17 tirthankaras and paintings of flowers. There is depiction of 14 dreams that a mother of a tirthankara on conception. On the second floor, the Chaumukha idol is of Sumatinatha, Parshvanatha, Adinatha and Parshvanatha. The idol of goddess Ambika is also present. The Chaumukha idol of Parshvanatha is installed on the third floor.

The outer walls of the sanctum comprise ornate sculptures in gray sandstone, depicting Dikpalas, Vidhyadevis, Yakshinis, Shalabhanjikas and other decorative sculptures comparable to the ones in Khajuraho and Konark.

=== Mahaveer Swami Temple ===
This is a small structure constructed in 1582 and dedicated to Mahavira. It is small temple with carvings on its walls. On the upper walls of the porch there are pictures painted in 1764 by the artists of Sirohi. There are detailed carvings of flowers, pigeons, court-scene, dancing girls, horses, elephant, and other scenes. On each side of Mahavira, there are 3 idols of tirthankar. Outside the shrine, there is a marble slab of rectangular shape with a triangle stone over it containing 133 images of miniature-sized tirthankar with a larger image in center.

=== Renovation ===
The temples have undergone repairs from time to time. Allauddin Khilji had attacked and damaged the temples in 1311. In 1321, Bijag and Lalag of Mandore had undertaken repairs.

In 1906, Lallubhai Jaichand of Patan had the temples repaired and reconsecrated on 25 April 1906, under the supervision of Yati Hemasagar. Extensive repairs were again undertaken during 1950-1965 by Anandji Kalyanji with the work done by the Sompura firm Amritlal Mulshankar Trivedi. The older marble has a yellow patina, whereas the newer marble is white.

The temples are currently administered by the Seth Kalyanji Paramanandji Pedi. Seth Kalyanji Paramanandji Pedi also runs a &quot;Bhojanshala&quot; (dining hall) nearby.

==Amenities==
Facilities are available for bathing, which is mandatory before puja is performed for the idols. These facilities use passive solar power to heat up the water for bathing and other things. Guided tour hours for tourists are posted outside the temple.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

According to Finnish folklore, the Korvatunturi Fell in Savukoski municipality is the location of Father Christmas&#x27;s (Joulupukki) secret workshop, where toys, trinkets and gifts are made and eventually wrapped by gnomes. The name Korvatunturi translates into English as &quot;Ear Fell&quot;. Finnish children are told that from &quot;Ear Fell&quot; Father Christmas can hear what all the children are saying so he can find out if the children behave and obey their parents (and therefore may receive gifts next Christmas).

Savukoski is one of the largest municipalities in Finland, areawise, and the most sparsely settled. The river Kemijoki runs through it. Forestry and reindeer husbandry have traditionally been the main livelihood of the local population. There are ten times more reindeer than people in Savukoski. Nowadays tourism is also getting more important.

The Urho Kekkonen National Park is also located partly in Savukoski.

A bog region called Äteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijänkä is in Savukoski. It has the longest place name in Finland.

<text>Elvis Jacob Stahr Jr. (March 9, 1916 – November 11, 1998) was an American government official, college president and administrator. After graduating from the University of Kentucky in 1936 as a member of Sigma Chi and Pershing Rifles, he attended Merton College at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He served as lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army during World War II. He returned to the University of Kentucky and became a professor and then dean of the College of Law, before becoming president of West Virginia University. He served as the United States Secretary of the Army between 1961 and 1962 and served as president of Indiana University from 1962 to 1968. He was the president of the National Audubon Society from 1968 until 1981.

==Early life==
Stahr was born in 1916 in Hickman, Kentucky, to Hon. Elvis Stahr, a Fulton County, Kentucky judge and his wife Mary McDaniel Stahr. At age 16, he entered the University of Kentucky, where he achieved the highest academic average in the history of the university. He graduated Omicron Delta Kappa in 1936, and was a member of Sigma Chi and the National Society of Pershing Rifles, a Reserve Officer Training Corps fraternal organization. He attended Merton College, Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship where he studied law. He was known at Oxford as &quot;the Colonel&quot; and resisted assuming British affectations. He practiced law in New York, then received a diploma in Chinese from Yale University. He served in combat units in China during World War II as a United States Army lieutenant colonel.

==Early career==
Stahr practiced law in New York after the war, and in 1946 married Dorothy Howland Berkfield, a New York City debutante. In 1947 he became a law professor at the University of Kentucky. He was named dean of the University of Kentucky College of Law and served until 1956. With University President Herman Lee Donovan and Justice Thurgood Marshall, he helped desegregate the law school. During the Korean War, he took a 16-month leave of absence to serve as special assistant to Secretary of the Army Frank Pace Jr. In 1956, Stahr was staff director of President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Commission on Education Beyond High School. He was vice chancellor at the University of Pittsburgh in 1957 and 1958, and then was president of West Virginia University until nominated as Secretary of the Army by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

==Secretary of the Army and President of Indiana University==
Stahr served as Secretary of the Army in 1961 and 1962, during the Berlin crisis and the Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored Bay of Pigs invasion, aimed at ousting Fidel Castro from power. A major reorganization plan was launched; combat division structure was reorganized, special warfare forces community relations (Civic Action) were expanded, and the Army was strengthened during the Berlin Crisis. Stahr also mobilized the Alabama National Guard in 1961, when the Kennedy Administration undertook desegregating of the University of Alabama.
In 1962 Stahr resigned to become President of Indiana University. He was the university&#x27;s twelfth president. The Gary and Calumet campuses were combined to form IU Northwest, the joint IU-Purdue University campus was established in Fort Wayne, the School of Library and Information Science was founded, and the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis was affiliated with Indiana University.

==Later career and life==
Stahr retired from Indiana University in 1968, accepting the presidency of the National Audubon Society. Under Stahr&#x27;s leadership, the Audubon Society undertook a campaign to increase its influence and membership, which in 10 years more than quadrupled to almost 400,000. As president of the Audubon Society, Stahr led efforts to preserve the Florida Everglades from commercial and industrial development, fought for accords on international whaling practices and campaigned successfully to liberalize U.S. tax laws to allow charitable organizations to lobby on public policy issues. He retired from Audubon in 1981. In the years following, he practiced law in Washington, D.C., and New York, lobbying for environmental issues. He had served on several corporate boards of directors, including Chase Manhattan Corp. and Acadia Mutual Life Insurance Co. In his life he earned more than 27 honorary degrees from various colleges and universities. He was also awarded Omicron Delta Kappa&#x27;s highest honor in 1984, the Laurel Crowned Circle Award. He died of cancer in his Greenwich, Connecticut, home on Veterans Day, November 11, 1998. Stahr and his wife Dorothy (1918–2005) are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="784256" wikidata="Q1110119" url="?curid=784256" title="Colm Wilkinson">
<text>Colm Wilkinson (born 5 June 1944), also known as C. T. Wilkinson, is an Irish singer and actor who is best known for originating the lead role of Jean Valjean in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (in the West End and Broadway) and for creating the title role in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1985) preview at the Sydmonton Festival and the original Canadian production.

Due to his association with these musicals, he reprised the role of Jean Valjean during the &quot;Les Misérables&quot; 10th Anniversary Concert (at The Royal Albert Hall), as well as appearing as a special guest at the &quot;Les Misérables&quot; 25th Anniversary Concert at the O2 Arena and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

His versions of both &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; from &quot;Phantom&quot; and &quot;Bring Him Home&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; are acclaimed throughout the world; fans &quot;insist he perform them...at all his concerts.&quot;

== Early life ==
Born in Drimnagh, in 1944, in the downstairs room of his parents&#x27; house, Wilkinson was one of ten children. He recalls a home that resonated with singing, poetry, and musical instruments. Both of his parents were skilled musicians. His mother, a native of Crossmolina in County Mayo, was a singer, and was involved in amateur dramatics, while the banjo and mandolin formed part of his father&#x27;s extensive repertoire. Wilkinson worked with his father, who was an asphalt contractor, and was playing in bands part-time. At 16 years of age, he went to the US on a tour, and soon after quit the family business to become a full-time professional musician.

== Life and career ==
After playing in several Irish bands which included The Action (not to be confused with an English band of the same name), in 1972, Wilkinson was cast as Judas Iscariot in the Dublin production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;; he went on to reprise the role in London and on the British national tour.

In 1976, Wilkinson sang the part of Che on the album for the musical &quot;Evita&quot;. Instead of auditioning for the role when the production was launched in London, Wilkinson launched a solo career as a singer-songwriter.

Wilkinson also featured as Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in the original &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; concept album.

By 1977, Wilkinson released his own eponymous album, in his childhood home in Ireland, where he was known as &quot;C.T. Wilkinson&quot;. The album charted in the Irish Charts for eight weeks at Number 1.

After his successful solo LP, Wilkinson began to prepare actively for vocal competitions. This led to his eventual representation of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1978 with &quot;Born to Sing&quot;, earning fifth place in the European competition for his efforts.

Wilkinson starred in &quot;Voices&quot;, a musical based on the life and times of Joan of Arc, which went on stage at the Olympia Dublin in 1984. The show&#x27;s music and lyrics were written by Derry-based composer, Tommy &quot;TC&quot; Doherty, with the single &quot;Child of Destiny&quot; being released at the time and now available on iTunes.

In 1985, he collaborated with Andrew Lloyd Webber once again, originating the role of The Phantom in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; at the Sydmonton workshop. Wilkinson was offered the role for the show&#x27;s debut on the West End, but instead chose to play Jean Valjean in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

The London production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; opened in October 1985, and transferred to Broadway in March 1987. Originally, the American Actors&#x27; Equity Association refused to allow Wilkinson to play the part of Valjean in New York, due to its strict policy of hiring only American actors unless an actor outside America was an international star. At this, producer Cameron Mackintosh refused to open the show unless Wilkinson played Valjean, and Actors&#x27; Equity relented. Wilkinson took the lead role despite the temporary setback. He won the Helen Hayes Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, and the Theatre World Award for his performance; he was nominated for the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Actor in a Musical.

In 1989, Wilkinson relocated his family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when he was offered the title role in the original Toronto production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; playing at the Pantages Theatre (now Ed Mirvish Theatre). He has lived in Toronto ever since, and became a Canadian citizen in the early 2000s. In 1992, an arbitrator for Actor&#x27;s Equity found that Wilkinson had used &quot;excessive roughness&quot; on his Phantom co-star Rebecca Caine, based on her testimony and witness accounts that he had repeatedly hurt her onstage and once severely sprained her wrist, which had to be put in a brace, resulting in her dismissal from the show. 

From August 1998 through January 1999, Wilkinson played Valjean once again, this time in Toronto at the Princess of Wales Theatre. Not long afterwards, he returned to the role of Valjean in Dublin, Ireland at the Point Theatre between February, 1999 and May, 1999. From June, 2002 to July, 2002 he again reprised the role in Shanghai at the Shanghai Grand Theatre.

In 1995, Wilkinson played Jean Valjean in the 10th Anniversary Concert of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall.

In October–November 2007, Wilkinson undertook a cross-Canada concert tour, &quot;Broadway and Beyond&quot;, along with Susan Gilmour and Gretha Boston.

Wilkinson plays the part of Lord Darcy in the third season showing of Showtime&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Tudors&quot; which began airing on 12 April 2009.

He participated in U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s birthday celebration at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on 8 March 2009. The highlight of the evening was when President Barack Obama arrived on the stage and together with all the performers sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Ted Kennedy. Wilkinson also was asked to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library at the Memorial Service for Senator Kennedy on 28 August 2009, the evening before the Senator&#x27;s funeral.

On 24 May 2009, Wilkinson performed in the National Memorial Day Concert at the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., in front of a large audience and screened live across America on PBS.

A solo album was released in January 2010 titled &quot;Broadway and Beyond: The Concert Songs&quot;. It covers all of the songs that Wilkinson performed on his cross-Canada tour in 2007. His previous album was released in 2002, titled &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are Songs&quot;. In it, he and his son Aaron cover the Cat Stevens song, &quot;Father and Son&quot;, as a duet. The album is a mix of show tunes, Wilkinson&#x27;s personal favorites, and several songs from his stage productions. His support of PBS and listener-supported television in North America, following his participation in the tenth anniversary of the production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, brought him an hour-long program on which he performed songs including some selections from the album and a rendition of &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, a song that he admitted having hoped to perform for 23 years. His supporting television broadcast, &quot;Stage Heroes: Colm Wilkinson&quot;, aired on the heels of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, brought positive reviews from fans and critic.

On 3 October 2010, Wilkinson was a special guest at the 25th Anniversary Concerts of Les Misérables, at the O2 Arena, alongside many other original cast members. He performed as part of a &quot;Valjean Quartet&quot;; alongside Alfie Boe, John Owen-Jones and Simon Bowman (each of whom had previously played the role of Jean Valjean in various productions of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;). This was recorded as a single (released in the U.K.) and performed live at the London Palladium; during the Royal Variety Performance on 16 December 2010.

A year later, on 1 and 2 October 2011, he appeared – alongside a number of former Phantoms – at the 25th Anniversary Celebration of The Phantom of the Opera, at The Royal Albert Hall.

He is a Founding Artist of Theatre 20, a musical theatre company in Toronto formed by artists in 2009, and performed in Theatre 20&#x27;s 2011 Concert Series at the Panasonic Theatre. Other Founding Artists include Susan Gilmour, Louise Pitre, Ma-Anne Dionisio, Tamara Bernier Evans and Adam Brazier.

Wilkinson appeared as the Bishop of Digne in the 2012 film production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. He reprised this role in a performance of the musical in Toronto in January 2014 where Ramin Karimloo played Valjean.

Wilkinson was voted one of the five greatest singers ever in a &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; readers&#x27; poll and is noted for maintaining a powerful singing voice into his late 60s. He has attributed his longevity to avoiding coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and dairy products, as well as ensuring proper sleep, diet, and exercise. He is also noted as being rather soft-spoken in order to refrain from overworking his voice.

== Personal life ==
In 1970, Wilkinson married Deirdre, whom he describes as a source of constant and essential support over the past four decades. They started their life as a married couple in Bray in 1970, and went on to have four children – Aaron, Judith, Sarah, and Simon. They have a home in Wicklow, yet now live mainly in Canada. The family moved to Toronto in 1989 when Wilkinson began a four-and-a-half-year run at the Pantages Theatre as the title character of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, originating the role in Canada. Of their children, Judith is now a curator, Simon and Sarah are graphic designers and Aaron is a singer/songwriter. Early in his music career, Wilkinson insisted that his wife and children accompany him on tour to avoid familial separation.

<text>Joseph Jerome McGinnity (March 20, 1871 – November 14, 1929) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the late 19th and early 20th century. McGinnity played in MLB for ten years, pitching for the National League&#x27;s (NL) Baltimore Orioles (1899) and Brooklyn Superbas (1900), before jumping to the American League (AL) to play for the Baltimore Orioles (AL) (1901–1902). He returned to the NL with the New York Giants (1902–1908). McGinnity continued to pitch in the minor leagues, eventually retiring from baseball for good at the age of 54.

In MLB, he won 246 games with a 2.66 earned run average (ERA). He had seven 20-win seasons and two 30-win seasons. Including his time in the minor leagues, McGinnity won close to 500 games as a professional ballplayer. He led MLB in wins five times (1899, 1900, 1903, 1904, and 1906) and ERA once (1904). With the Giants, he won the 1905 World Series. His teams also won NL pennants in 1900 and 1904.

McGinnity was nicknamed &quot;[[Iron man (sports streak)|Iron Man]]&quot; because he worked in an iron foundry during the baseball offseasons. His nickname came to convey his longevity and durability, as he routinely pitched in both games of doubleheaders. He set an NL record for innings pitched (434) in a single season, which still stands (and with modern MLB practices which limit pitchers&#x27; innings, is considered effectively unbreakable). McGinnity is considered one of the better players in the history of the New York Giants. The Veterans Committee elected him to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946.

==Early life==
McGinnity&#x27;s father, Peter, was born in Dublin, Ireland. His last name was McGinity before he came to United States. He changed it by adding an &quot;n&quot; after he emigrated to the United States in 1861. Peter worked in coal mines and on the farm owned by John and Rebecca Denning, and they accepted him, allowing him to move in with them in their Henry County farm. John and Rebecca moved to Oregon, leaving the homestead in the hands of Peter and their daughter, Hannah. The two married in August 1865, three months before the birth of their first son, William. Their second son, Peter, was born in 1869, and Joe was their third born. Joseph Jerome McGinnity was born on March 20, 1871, in Cornwall Township, Illinois. The McGinnitys had four more children.

Joe received little formal schooling. Due to the transient lifestyle of coal miners, his family moved frequently during his childhood. The McGinnitys moved to Gallatin County in 1878. Two days after the birth of their seventh child, Peter died in an accident. At the age of eight, Joe and his older brothers went to work in the mines to support their family. In 1880, the family moved to Springfield, Illinois, where Joe and his brothers worked for the Springfield Coal Company. They moved to Decatur, Illinois, less than six months later, continuing to mine coal, while their mother cleaned houses.

==Semiprofessional career==
While living in Decatur, McGinnity began playing baseball with other coal miners in their leisure time. The owner of the Decatur Coal Company founded the Decatur Baseball Association in 1886. An outfielder, McGinnity substituted for his team&#x27;s pitcher in an 1888 game, which he won. He continued to pitch from that point on. He pitched for semi-professional teams based in Decatur in 1888 and 1889. His family headed west, stopping in the Indian Territory on their way to Montana, where Hannah&#x27;s sister struck gold in their coal mine. McGinnity and his brothers worked in a coal mine in Krebs. There, he met his future wife, Mary Redpath, the oldest daughter of a fellow coal miner. McGinnity also played baseball for the local team. He increased baseball&#x27;s popularity in the area, and was later referred to as &quot;the father of Oklahoma baseball&quot; by a sportswriter for &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;, as he organized, managed, and pitched for teams in Krebs. One of these teams began traveling to other towns along the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad to play against their local teams. He also pitched for teams in neighboring towns.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
John McCloskey, the manager of the minor league baseball Montgomery Colts of the Class-B Southern League, heard about McGinnity&#x27;s pitching. McCloskey signed McGinnity, who made his professional debut with the Colts in 1893. McCloskey habitually baited umpires during games, a trait which McGinnity learned. The league folded as a result of financial troubles related to the Panic of 1893. Jimmie Manning, manager of the Southern League franchise in Savannah, Georgia, became manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-A Western League for the 1894 season, and signed McGinnity to pitch for the Blues. Combined for Montgomery and Kansas City, McGinnity had a 21–29 win–loss record, while walking more batters than he could strikeout, and allowing more than a hit per inning pitched. According to a Western League umpire, catcher Tim Donahue tipped McGinnity&#x27;s pitches to opposing batters due to a personal feud. As McGinnity continued to struggle for Kansas City, he requested his release in June.

McGinnity moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked as a coal miner, bartender, and operated a saloon. McGinnity also pitched locally for semi-professional teams in Springfield and Decatur, receiving a salary between $1 and $3 (between $ and $ in current dollar terms) for each game. During this time, McGinnity developed a sidearm pitch he nicknamed &quot;Old Sal&quot;, described as a &quot;slow curve&quot;, which became a feature of his later success. He also improved his fielding, as opponents attempted to bunt &quot;Old Sal&quot;.

While pitching for a semi-professional team, McGinnity defeated the National League&#x27;s (NL) Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition game after he had already defeated a team from Chatham, Illinois, earlier in the day. Pat Wright, who managed Springfield&#x27;s semi-professional team, was named manager of the Peoria Distillers of the Class-B Western Association, and he signed McGinnity to Peoria for the 1898 season, marking his return to professional baseball. Armed with &quot;Old Sal&quot;, McGinnity compiled a 9–4 record for Peoria, allowing only 118 hits and 60 walks while striking out 74 batters in 142 innings. He pitched a complete 21-inning game, believed to be the second longest professional baseball game to date. With low attendance and the distraction of the Spanish–American War, the Western Association folded in August.

===Baltimore Orioles (NL) (1899)===

Former Brooklyn Grooms player George Pinkney, who lived in Peoria during his retirement, saw McGinnity pitch, and contacted Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets to recommend he sign McGinnity. He signed McGinnity in the spring of 1899 for $150 a month ($ in current dollar terms). The syndicate that owned Brooklyn also owned the Baltimore Orioles.

With the ownership consolidation, Orioles player-manager Ned Hanlon, who received an ownership stake in the clubs, moved from Baltimore to Brooklyn and assigned many of his best players to Brooklyn, including Joe Kelley, Dan McGann, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler. Hanlon assigned McGinnity to the Orioles for the 1899 season after seeing his unorthodox pitching delivery and slow pitching speed. With the Orioles, McGinnity played with John McGraw, who succeeded Hanlon as player-manager, and Wilbert Robinson, who caught McGinnity. McGraw and Robinson had refused to relocate to Brooklyn due to their investment in a Baltimore restaurant. The two imparted their aggressive style of play to McGinnity. In his first year in the NL, McGinnity had a 28–16 record. His 28 wins led the NL, while he ranked second with 48 games, third with a 2.68 earned run average (ERA), and fourth with innings pitched.

===Brooklyn Superbas (1900)===
After the 1899 season, the NL voted to contract four teams, which included the Orioles. Hanlon assigned McGinnity to Brooklyn, now known as the &quot;Superbas&quot;. McGinnity posted a 28–8 record for Brooklyn in the 1900 season. His 28 wins and 343 innings pitched led the league, as the Dodgers won the NL pennant. McGinnity also pitched two complete games in the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, as the Superbas defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates. Rather than draw straws to decide who would keep the trophy, the team voted to award it to McGinnity.

With the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, and rumors that the AL&#x27;s Detroit Tigers were interested in McGinnity, Brooklyn offered McGinnity a $5,000 contract ($ in current dollar terms) to stay with Brooklyn.

===Baltimore Orioles (AL) (1901–1902)===
McGinnity considered retiring from baseball, but ultimately jumped to the AL, signing with the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season. He received a salary of $2,800 ($ in current dollar terms), choosing less money in an upstart league for the chance to be reunited with McGraw, who was player-manager and part-owner of the Orioles.

Fighting continued to erupt in games McGraw managed. During a brawl that erupted during a game against the Detroit Tigers on August 21, 1901, McGinnity spat on umpire Tom Connolly. McGinnity was arrested for the incident and permanently suspended by AL president Ban Johnson, who wanted there to be no fighting in AL games. Johnson later cut the suspension down to 12 days after McGinnity apologized. McGinnity compiled a 26–20 record for the 1901 Orioles, and his 48 games, 39 complete games, and 382 innings pitched led the AL.

McGinnity began the 1902 season with the Orioles. However, the franchise began to fall into significant debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager John McGraw. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released McGinnity, McGraw, Kelley, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts.

===New York Giants (1902–1908)===
Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants. McGinnity attempted to contact Johnson that night, offering to stay with the Orioles if he could receive Johnson&#x27;s personal assurance that he was welcome to stay. McGinnity did not hear back from Johnson, who had left his phone off the hook that night to avoid being contacted, and joined his teammates with the Giants.

With the Giants for the 1903 season, McGinnity won 31 games. He also set MLB records with 48 games started and 434 innings pitched, which remain NL records today. Jack Chesbro, pitching for the New York Highlanders of the American League during the 1904 season, set the current MLB records with 55 games started and innings. In 1903, McGinnity started both games of a doubleheader on numerous occasions. He performed this feat three times in a single month, winning all six games. On the final instance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;he seemed fresh enough to tackle the visitors for a third contest if that were necessary&quot;. He pitched over 100 innings in the month of August. Wins by McGinnity and fellow pitcher Christy Mathewson accounted for 73% of the Giants&#x27; winning games in 1903, setting an MLB record for a pitching tandem. After the season, McGinnity and some of his teammates threatened to quit the Giants, accusing Brush, now the Giants owner, of going back on a promise to pay the team a monetary bonus for having finished among the top three teams in the NL, as well as a share of the from exhibition games, for which they were paid $56.35 ($ in current dollar terms), though Brush allegedly had made over $200,000 ($ in current dollar terms). McGinnity claimed that he would pitch in the California League, as he had received a salary offer for &quot;$1,000 ($ in current dollar terms) more than [he] got in New York&quot;. Jack Warner eventually joined McGinnity in publicly threatening to quit.
McGinnity set an MLB record during the 1904 season, recording his tenth win in 21 team games on May 21, the fewest team games for a pitcher to reach the mark. In 1904, McGinnity had a 35–8 record, leading the NL in games (51), innings pitched (408), shutouts (9), saves (5), and his career-best 1.61 ERA. With the Giants competing for the pennant, McGinnity again won both games in a doubleheader three times in a matter of weeks. Aided by McGinnity, the Giants won the NL pennant. However, they did not compete in the 1904 World Series as Brush and McGraw refused to face the AL champion Boston Pilgrims, following their altercations with Johnson. After the 1904 season, McGinnity attempted to hold out from the Giants when Brush refused to allow McGinnity to play winter baseball with a team in the Southern United States.

McGinnity won 21 games in the 1905 season, as the Giants won the NL pennant again. This year, the Giants participated in the 1905 World Series, against the AL champion Philadelphia Athletics. McGinnity started Games Two and Four of the five game series against the Athletics, winning one and losing one, while Mathewson pitched and won the other three. All five games, including the game McGinnity lost to Chief Bender, were shutouts. In 1906, McGinnity again led the NL in wins, with 27. This came in spite of a suspension McGinnity served for fighting Pirates catcher Heinie Peitz, which NL president Harry Pulliam described as &quot;attempting to make the ball park a slaughterhouse.&quot; The Mayor of Pittsburgh, who attended the game, insisted that McGinnity be arrested.

In the 1907 season, McGinnity finished with an 18–18 record with a 3.16 ERA, allowing more than a hit per inning for the first time since the 1901 season. He missed the beginning of the 1908 season with a severe fever. In June 1908, Brush put McGinnity on waivers, hoping another owner would relieve him of McGinnity&#x27;s $5,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). He tried to waive McGinnity again in August, but both times McGinnity went unclaimed. Despite this, McGinnity reverted to his old form: from August 22 through the end of the season, he had three wins and two saves as the Giants battled the Chicago Cubs for the NL pennant, falling one game short as the Cubs beat them in a one-game playoff on the final day of the season. Overall, McGinnity had an 11–7 record, five shutouts, a 2.27 ERA, and an NL-leading five saves. The Giants released McGinnity on February 27, 1909, when McGinnity decided to pay for his own release.

===Later career===

McGinnity purchased the Newark Indians of the Class-A Eastern League (EL) for $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 1909 from Frank J. Farrell. The press reported that McGinnity would operate the team as a farm team of the Giants, though he denied these reports. When McGinnity could not retain manager Harry Wolverton, he stepped in as player-manager for the Indians. That season, he had a 29–16 record. His 422 innings pitched and 11 shutouts set EL single-season records. He also won both games of doubleheaders on August 27, 1909, and July 23, 1912.

McGinnity played for and managed the Indians through 1912. The Indians finished second in the EL in 1909 and 1910. McGinnity sold his interests in the Indians to Ebbets and Ed McKeever and purchased the Tacoma Tigers of the Class-B Northwestern League for $8,500 ($ in current dollar terms), spending another $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) on the franchise in renovating the stadium. He served as player-manager of the Tigers at the start of the 1913 season, but stepped down as manager, hiring Russ Hall to serve as manager in June. McGinnity sold stock in the team in 1915 in order to afford operating expenses. He also briefly played for the Venice Tigers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League in 1914.

McGinnity sold the Tigers and purchased the Butte Miners of the Northwestern League in 1916, serving as player-manager and bringing with him several players from Tacoma. In June 1917, he sold his stock in the team and secured his release. He played for the Great Falls Electrics of the Northwestern League for the remainder of the 1917 season. He later became the manager of the A. E. Staley factory baseball team.

McGinnity served as player-manager of the Danville Veterans of the Class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in the 1922 season and Dubuque Climbers of the Class-D Mississippi Valley League during the 1923 season. With Dubuque, McGinnity won 15 games at age 52. One of those wins was a shutout, pitched in a record one hour and seven minutes. Two years later, he returned to play for Dubuque and the Springfield Senators of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League during the 1925 season. He pitched in his final professional game on July 28, 1925, after participating in an old-timers game earlier in the day.

McGinnity joined the coaching staff of former teammate Wilbert Robinson, along with Kelley, for the Brooklyn Dodgers during the 1926 MLB season. McGinnity and Kelley were not retained after the season.

==Personal life==
McGinnity acquired his nickname, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, before his doubleheader pitching became widely discussed. According to Lee Allen in &quot;The National League Story&quot; (1961), a reporter asked McGinnity, while he was still a minor league pitcher, what he did in between seasons. &quot;I&#x27;m an iron man&quot;, he answered. &quot;I work in a foundry.&quot; McGinnity&#x27;s wife&#x27;s family operated an iron foundry in McAlester, Oklahoma, where McGinnity worked in the offseasons.

Because of his nickname and connection to the foundry, John McGraw named McGinnity the starter for the Giants&#x27; March 23, 1904, exhibition game against the Southern Association&#x27;s Birmingham Iron Men which was scheduled to raise funds for the Vulcan statue then being cast for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition that summer in St. Louis, Missouri. At his own request, McGinnity was allowed to visit the downtown foundry and personally pour some of the iron into the moulds for the statue.

While working with Williams College&#x27;s baseball team in 1929, McGinnity became ill. He had surgery to remove tumors from his bladder, and was said to be in critical condition. After the surgery, he was quoted as saying &quot;it&#x27;s the ninth inning, and I guess they&#x27;re going to get me out.&quot; He died November 14, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York, at the home of his daughter. He was interred in McAlester.

==Legacy==

McGinnity finished his MLB career with 246 career wins, seven 20-win seasons, and two 30-win seasons. He had nearly 500 professional wins including his years in the minor leagues. McGinnity set a career record in batters hit by pitch with 152. He revolutionized the fielding of the pitching position, by attempting to make force outs at any base, instead of throwing the ball only to first base.

After his death, McGinnity was eulogized as a &quot;hard player&quot; and &quot;a fighter with brains&quot; who hated to lose. Jennings described him as an even better fielder than he was a pitcher. McGraw said that McGinnity was &quot;the hardest working pitcher I ever had on my ballcub&quot;. Connie Mack called him a &quot;magician&quot;.

After failing to receive the necessary votes from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America for entry in the National Baseball Hall of Fame on seven occasions, McGinnity was posthumously elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1946. He was also inducted into the Quad City Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.

Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included McGinnity in their 1981 book, &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; included McGinnity in its all-time Illinois team in 1990. In his 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, Bill James ranked McGinnity as the 41st greatest pitcher of all time.

<text>Muszyna is a town in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, southern Poland. Population: 4,989 (2006). It plays host to a railroad junction, located near border with Slovakia, with trains going into three directions - towards Nowy Sącz, Krynica-Zdrój and southwards, to Slovakia. The distance from the town to the Slovak border is .

Muszyna lies in the valley of the Poprad, at an altitude of above sea level. The town has the status of a spa, with the Poprad Landscape Park and the picturesque Poprad River Gorge located nearby.

==History==
Muszyna&#x27;s development is tied with proximity of the southern borders of the Polish state. The settlement was located along the so-called “Hungarian Trail”, as for centuries Slovakia belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary. Muszyna was first mentioned in 1209, in a document in which King Andrew II of Hungary allowed local parish priest to collect tolls at the Poprad river near Muszyna. At that time, the settlement belonged to the Niegowicki family (Półkozic coat of arms). In 1288 Muszyna passed into the hands of Bishops of Kraków, and in the early 14th century, King Władysław Łokietek, after a conflict with Bishop Jan Muskata, and the Rebellion of wójt Albert, decided to make the village a royal property. Muszyna remained in the hands of Polish kings for almost 100 years, and in 1356, it was granted Magdeburg rights town charter by King Kazimierz Wielki.

On July 30, 1391, King Władysław Jagiełło granted the so-called Muszyna State (with two towns and 35 villages) to the Bishops of Kraków. As a result, the Muszyna State (&quot;Państwo Muszyńskie&quot;) was treated as a separate territorial unit, with its own administration, army and courts. On behalf of Kraków Bishops, the property was governed by starostas, and remained in the hands of the bishops until 1781. In the 15th century, influx of settlers from Wallachia and Transcarpathia resulted in construction of several Orthodox churches. Muszyna was an important center of the Bar Confederation, and after Partitions of Poland, it became part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained from 1772 to 1918.

===Mineral springs===
In the 1920s, thanks to the efforts of mayor Antoni Jurczak and doctor Seweryn Msciwujewski, Muszyna received the status of a spa town. In 1930 it became a member of the Association of Polish Spa Towns, and in 1932, first mineral springs (Antoni and Wanda) were opened. Muszyna&#x27;s mineral waters contain several bioelements and make it a popular tourist destination across Poland.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

== History ==
The name of Sievi is derived from the word &quot;sievä&quot;, which in the local dialect means &quot;smooth&quot;. The name was in reference to an esker on which the farm of &quot;Sievi(lä)&quot; was located. Said farm was first mentioned in 1547 and was owned by Olli Ollinpoika Hihna. Sievi was a part of the Kalajoki parish, under which it became a chapel community in 1645. The chapel community was also known as &quot;Evijärvi&quot; (not to be confused with the Southern Ostrobothnian Evijärvi) after another village in the area, which is nowadays known as Järvikylä. After becoming an independent parish and municipality in 1862, &quot;Sievi&quot; became the only official name for it.

<text>Marco Minghetti (18 November 1818 – 10 December 1886) was an Italian economist and statesman.

==Biography==
Minghetti was born in Bologna, then part of the Papal States.

With Antonio Montanan and Rodolfo Audinot he founded at Bologna a paper, &quot;Il Felsineo&quot;. He signed the petition to the Papal conclave, 1846, urging the election of a liberal pope, and was appointed member of the state council summoned to prepare a constitution for the Papal States. In the first constitutional cabinet of the Papal States, presided over by Cardinal Antonelli, Minghetti held the portfolio of public works, but after Pius IX publicly spoke against the Italian Risorgimento he resigned, and joined the Piedmontese army as captain on the general staff.

Returning to Rome in September 1848, he refused to join a papal ministry after the November 15 assassination of Pellegrino Rossi, and spent the next eight years in study and travel. In 1856, he was summoned to Paris by Cavour to help prepare a memorandum on the future status of the Romagna provinces for the negotiations occurring for the Paris congress resolving the Crimean War. In 1859, he was appointed by Cavour to become secretary-general of the Piedmontese Foreign Office. In the same year he was elected president of the assembly of the Romagna after the rejection of pontifical rule by those provinces, and prepared their annexation to Piedmont.

In October 1860 he was appointed Piedmontese minister of the interior, but he resigned office shortly after Cavour&#x27;s death. In 1862, he was subsequently chosen to be minister of finance by prime minister Farini. In 1863, Minghetti succeeded Farini as prime minister, and held this position for 19 months. With the help of Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta, by September 15, 1864, he concluded the September Convention agreed to by France, whereby Napoleon III of France agreed to evacuate Rome, and the Savoy monarchy of Italy to transfer her capital from Turin to Florence. The convention excited violent opposition at Turin, causing Minghetti to resign. He took little part in public life until 1869, when he accepted the portfolio of agriculture in the Menabrea Cabinet.

Both in and out of office he exercised his influence against an Italo-French alliance and for an immediate advance upon Rome, and in 1870 was sent to London and Vienna by the Lanza-Sella Cabinet to organize a league of neutral powers on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1873 he overthrew the Lanza-Sella Cabinet and regained the premiership, which, with the portfolio of finance, he held until the fall of the Right from power on 18 March 1876.

During his premiership he inaugurated the &quot;rapprochement&quot; between Italy, Austria and Germany, and reformed the naval and military administration; and before his ouster he was able, as finance minister, to balance the State budget for the first time since 1860. After the advent of the Left, Minghetti remained for some years in opposition, but towards 1884 joined Depretis in creating the &quot;Trasformismo&quot; (&quot;Transformation&quot; movement), which united the various liberal factions in the country. He hoped to imitate the example of William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Liberal Party. Minghetti, however, drew from it no personal advantage, and died at Rome on 10 December 1886 without having returned to power.

His writings include: &quot;Della economia pubblica e delle sue attinenze con la morale e col diritto&quot; (Bologna, 1859), and &quot;La Chiesa e lo Stato&quot; (Milan, 1878). He is commemorated in Rome by a monument at Piazza San Pantaleo on the Corso.

<doc id="784324" wikidata="Q5176635" url="?curid=784324" title="Count (baseball)">
<text>In baseball and softball, the count refers to the number of balls and strikes the batter has. If the count reaches three strikes, the batter strikes out; if the count reaches four balls, the batter earns a base on balls (a &quot;walk&quot;).

==Usage==
The count is usually announced as a pair of numbers, for example, 3–1 (pronounced as &quot;three and one&quot;), the number of balls followed by the number of strikes. Zero is almost always pronounced as &quot;oh&quot;. The count is often used as adjective—an individual pitch may be referred to by the count prior to its delivery; for example, a pitch thrown on a 3–1 count is a &quot;three-one pitch&quot; or a &quot;three-and-one pitch&quot;.

A count of 0–0 is rarely stated; the count is typically not mentioned until at least one pitch has been thrown. A count of 1–1 or 2–2 may be described as &quot;even&quot;. A count of 3–2 is &quot;full&quot;, which is discussed below.

The home plate umpire signals the count with the number of balls on the left hand, and the number of strikes on the right hand. (As a result, it reads backwards when viewed from the pitcher&#x27;s point of view.) Individual umpires vary in how frequently they give this signal; it is often done as a reminder when there has been a slight delay between pitches, such as due to the batter stepping out of the batter&#x27;s box. It can also signal the scoreboard operator that the board shows an incorrect count. Some umpires may also call out the count, although usually only the batter and catcher can hear it.

==Significance==
Baseball statistics measure which counts are most likely to produce favorable outcomes for the pitcher or the batter. Counts of 3–1 and 2–0 are considered advantageous to batters (&quot;hitters&#x27; counts&quot;), because the pitcher—faced with the possibility of walking the batter—is more likely to throw a ball in the strike zone, particularly a fastball. Counts with two strikes (except 3–2) are considered advantageous to pitchers (&quot;pitchers&#x27; counts&quot;). An 0–2 count is very favorable to a pitcher, who has the freedom to throw one or two pitches out of the strike zone intentionally, to get the batter to &quot;chase&quot; the pitch (swing at it), and strike out.

A 3–0 count tends to yield fewer hittable pitches, perhaps because the umpire is reluctant to call four straight balls and may tolerate a fourth pitch that barely misses the strike zone. Batters often &quot;take&quot; (do not swing at) a 3–0 pitch, since the pitcher has missed the strike zone three straight times already, and a fourth would earn the batter a walk. This is a sound strategy because the batter is more likely to eventually reach base even if the count becomes 3–1 than he is if he puts the ball in play on 3–0. It is sometimes also advantageous to take on 2–0 and 3–1.

==Full count==

A 3–2 count is called a full count and the ensuing pitch is called a &quot;payoff pitch&quot;, since a mistake by either the pitcher or the batter ends the plate appearance. The payoff pitch is not necessarily the final pitch in the plate appearance, as a batter may maintain two strikes indefinitely by hitting foul balls.

The full count term may derive from older scoreboards, which had spaces (rather than numerals) to denote up to three balls and up to two strikes. Many scoreboards still use light bulbs for this purpose; thus a 3–2 count means that all the bulbs are lit. The alternate term full house (more commonly used in softball) is inspired by the full house hand in poker, consisting of three of a kind and a pair.

With two outs and a full count, any baserunners who might be forced out start to run toward the next base at the moment the pitcher begins to deliver the pitch. This is because either the batter will walk (awarding such runners the next base), strike out to end the inning, foul off the pitch (allowing runners to return to their original bases), or put the ball into play.

===History===
The full count was not always 3–2, and went through an evolution in the 1870s and 1880s, seeing a gradual reduction in balls allowed before a bases on balls was called. Prior to , fouls were not counted as strikes (though foul bunts were, onwards from ).

<text>Giacomo Antonelli (2 April 1806 – 6 November 1876) was an Italian Catholic prelate who served as Cardinal Secretary of State for the Holy See from 1848 until his death. He played a key role in Italian politics, resisting the unification of Italy and affecting Catholic interests in European affairs. He was often called the &quot;Italian Richelieu&quot; and the &quot;Red Pope.&quot;

==Life==
He was born at Sonnino near Terracina and was educated for the priesthood, but after taking minor orders, he gave up the idea of becoming a priest and chose an administrative career. Created secular prelate, he was sent as apostolic delegate to Viterbo in 1836, where he early manifested his reactionary tendencies in an attempt to stamp out Liberalism. In 1839 he was transferred to Macerata. In 1840 he was ordained a deacon. Recalled to Rome in 1841 by Pope Gregory XVI, he entered the offices of the Secretariat of State, but four years later was appointed pontifical treasurer-general.

Created cardinal on 11 June 1847, one of the last cardinal deacons in deacon&#x27;s orders, he was chosen by Pius IX to preside over the council of state entrusted with the drafting of a constitution for the Papal States.

On 10 March 1848, Antonelli became premier of the first constitutional ministry of Pius IX. Upon the collapse of his cabinet when liberals resigned in protest again papal public refusal to participate in a war of national liberation, 29 April 1848, Antonelli created for himself the governorship of the sacred palaces in order to retain constant access to and influence over the pope.

After the assassination of Pellegrino Rossi (15 November 1848), he arranged the flight of Pius IX to Gaeta on 23 November.
That year, the Papal States were overthrown by liberals and replaced by a Roman Republic, only to be restored to the pope in 1849 by force of French and Austrian arms, called in at Antonelli&#x27;s request.

Notwithstanding promises to the powers upon returning to Rome, on 12 April 1850 Antonelli restored absolute government and disregarded the conditions of the surrender by ordering the wholesale imprisonment of liberals. In 1855, he narrowly escaped assassination. As an ally of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies from whom he had received an annual subsidy, he attempted after 1860 to facilitate Ferdinand&#x27;s restoration by fomenting brigandage on the Neapolitan frontier. To the overtures of Bettino Ricasoli in 1861, Pius IX, at Antonelli&#x27;s suggestion, replied with the famous &quot;Non possumus&quot; but in 1862 accepted too late Ricasoli&#x27;s proposal concerning ecclesiastical property.

After the September Convention of 1864, Antonelli organized the Legion of Antibes to replace French troops in Rome and in 1867 secured French aid against Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s invasion of papal territory. Upon the reoccupation of Rome by the French after the Battle of Mentana on 3 November 1867, Antonelli again ruled supreme, but after the entry of the Italians in 1870, he was obliged to restrict his activity to the management of foreign relations. With the Pope&#x27;s approval, he wrote the letter requesting the Italians to occupy the Leonine City in which the Italian government had intended to allow the pope to keep his temporal power and obtained from the Italians payment of the Peter&#x27;s pence (5,000,000 lire) remaining in the papal exchequer, as well as 50,000 scudi, the only instalment of the Italian allowance (subsequently fixed by the Law of Guarantees, 21 March 1871) that was ever accepted by the Holy See.

By the nature of the post that he occupied from 1850 to his death, Antonelli had little to do with questions of dogma and Church discipline although he signed the circulars addressed to the Powers transmitting the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot; (1864) and the acts of the First Vatican Council (1870).

His activity was devoted almost exclusively to the struggle between the papacy and the Italian Risorgimento. He died on 6 November 1876.

Antonelli bequeathed his personal fortune of about 623,341 gold francs (derived chiefly from his family patrimony) to his four living brothers and two nephews, though pointedly excluding a nephew who had become an anticlerical Italian nationalist, and bequeathed his collection of precious gems to the Vatican museum and the crucifix that he kept on his desk to Pope Pius IX as a personal memento.

Although it did not prevent Pope Pius IX&#x27;s beatification, some observers believe that Antonelli&#x27;s notoriety might be enough to prevent his canonization. 
Antonelli was one of the last deacons to be created a cardinal before Pope Benedict XV decreed in 1917 that all cardinals must have been ordained priests.

No cardinal eligible to participate in a papal conclave has gone as long as Antonelli—29 years—without doing so. Roger Etchegaray overtook Antonelli on 26 November 2008 in years of service as a cardinal and ultimately served for 40 years without participating in a conclave, but he was only eligible to do so for about 23 years because of the age limit of 80 years old imposed by Pope Paul VI in 1971. In both Antonelli&#x27;s and Etchegaray&#x27;s cases, their nonparticipation in conclaves was not by choice since there was no conclave either of them could attend freely and legally. No conclave was held during Antonelli&#x27;s cardinalate, and Etchegaray was excluded by his age from participating in the conclaves of 2005 and 2013.

<text>A fellow traveller (also fellow traveler) is a person who is intellectually sympathetic to the ideology of a political organization, and who co-operates in the organization&#x27;s politics, without being a formal member. In the early history of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolutionary and Soviet statesman Anatoly Lunacharsky coined the term &quot;poputchik&quot; (&#x27;one who travels the same path&#x27;); it was later popularized by Leon Trotsky to identify the vacillating intellectual supporters of the Bolshevik government. It was the political characterisation of the Russian &quot;intelligentsiya&quot; (writers, academics, and artists) who were philosophically sympathetic to the political, social, and economic goals of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but who did not join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The usage of the term &quot;poputchik&quot; disappeared from political discourse in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era, but the Western world adopted the English term &quot;fellow traveller&quot; to identify people who sympathised with the Soviets and with Communism.

In U.S. politics, during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, the term &quot;fellow traveler&quot; was primarily a pejorative applied to those on the political left, to suggest a person who was philosophically sympathetic to Communism, yet was not a formal, &quot;card-carrying member&quot; of the Communist Party USA. In political discourse, the term &quot;fellow traveler&quot; was applied to intellectuals, academics, and politicians who lent their names and prestige to Communist front organizations.
In European politics, the equivalent terms for &quot;fellow traveller&quot; are: and in France; , (neutral) or (negative connotation) in Germany; and in Italy.

== European usages ==

=== USSR ===
In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks applied the term Poputchik (&quot;one who travels the same path&quot;) to Russian writers who accepted the revolution, but who were not active revolutionaries. In the book &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot; (1923), Leon Trotsky popularized the usage of &quot;Poputchik&quot; as a political descriptor attributed to the pre-Revolutionary Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the Social Democrats) to identify a vacillating political sympathizer. In Chapter 2, &quot;The Literary &#x27;Fellow-Travellers&#x27; of the Revolution&quot;, Trotsky said: Between bourgeois Art, which is wasting away either in repetitions or in silences, and the new art which is as yet unborn, there is being created a transitional art, which is more or less organically connected with the Revolution, but which is not, at the same time, the Art of the Revolution. Boris Pilnyak, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nicolai Tikhonov, the Serapion Fraternity, Yesenin and his group of Imagists and, to some extent, Kliuev – all of them were impossible without the Revolution, either as a group or separately. ... They are not the artists of the proletarian Revolution, but her artist &quot;fellow-travellers&quot;, in the sense in which this word was used by the old Socialists... As regards a &quot;fellow-traveller&quot;, the question always comes up – How far will he go? This question cannot be answered in advance, not even approximately. The solution of it depends, not so much on the personal qualities of this or that &quot;fellow-traveller&quot;, but mainly on the objective trend of things during the coming decade.Victor Suvorov in his &quot;Soviet military intelligence&quot; (1984) referred to a less respectable term &quot;shit-eaters&quot; () used by the GRU handlers when talking about the category of agents of influence who were conscious sympathisers of the Soviet movement:
=== Nazi Germany ===
In the aftermath of the Second World War, the Russian term &quot;poputchik&quot; (fellow traveller) was translated to the German as &quot;Mitläufer&quot;, to identify a person who, although not formally charged with participation in war crimes, was sufficiently involved with the Nazi régime to the extent that the Allied authorities responsible for the denazification of Germany could not legally exonerate them from association with the war crimes of the Wehrmacht.

=== Greece ===
For the term &quot;fellow traveller&quot;, the reactionary Régime of the Colonels (1967–74) used the Greek word &quot;Synodiporia&quot; (&quot;The ones walking the street together&quot;) as an umbrella term that described domestic Greek Leftists and democratic opponents of the military dictatorship; likewise, the military government used term &quot;Diethnis&quot; (&quot;international &quot;Synodiporia&quot;&quot;) to identify the foreign supporters of the domestic anti-fascist Greeks.

== American usages ==
=== Pre-World War II U.S. ===
In the U.S., the European term &quot;fellow-traveller&quot; was adapted to describe persons politically sympathetic to, but not members of, the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), who shared the political perspectives of Communism. In the 1920s and 1930s, the political, social, and economic problems in the U.S. and throughout the world, caused partly by the Great Depression, motivated idealistic young people, artists, and intellectuals to become sympathetic to the Communist cause, in hope they could overthrow capitalism. To that end, black Americans joined the CPUSA (1919) because some of their politically liberal stances (e.g. legal racial equality) corresponded to the political struggles of black people for civil rights and social justice, in the time when Jim Crow laws established and maintained racial segregation throughout the United States. Moreover, the American League for Peace and Democracy (ALPD) was the principal socio-political group who actively worked by anti-fascism rather than by pacifism; as such, the ALPD was the most important organization within the Popular Front, a pro-Soviet coalition of anti-fascist political organizations.

As in Europe, in the 1920s and 1930s, the intellectuals of the U.S. either sympathized with or joined the U.S. Communist Party, to oppose the economic excesses of capitalism and fascism, which they perceived as its political form. In 1936, the newspaper columnist Max Lerner included the term &quot;fellow traveler&quot; in the article &quot;Mr. Roosevelt and His Fellow Travelers&quot; (&quot;The Nation&quot;).

In 1938, Joseph Brown Matthews Sr. featured the term in the title of his political biography &quot;Odyssey of a Fellow Traveler&quot; (1938); later, J. B. Matthews was the chief investigator for the anti-Communist activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Robert E. Stripling also credited Matthews: &quot;J.B. Matthews, a former Communist fellow traveler (and, incidentally, the originator of that apt tag)...&quot;

Among the writers and intellectuals known as fellow travelers were Ernest Hemingway and Theodore Dreiser novelists whose works of fiction occasionally were critical of capitalism and its excesses, whilst John Dos Passos, a known left-winger, moved to the right-wing and became a staunch anti-Communist.

Likewise, the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine, Malcolm Cowley had been a fellow traveler during the 1930s, but broke from the Communist Party, because of the ideological contradictions inherent to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 23 August 1939). The novelist and critic Waldo Frank was a fellow traveler during the mid-1930s, and was the chairman of the League of American Writers, in 1935, but was ousted as such, in 1937, when he called for an enquiry to the reasons for Joseph Stalin&#x27;s purges (1936–38) of Russian society.

From 1934 to 1939, the historian Richard Hofstadter briefly was a member of the Young Communist League USA. Despite disillusionment because of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia and the ideological rigidity of the Communist party-line, Hofstadter remained a fellow traveler until the 1940s. In &quot;Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World&quot; (2003), Eric Foner said that Hofstatdter continued thinking of himself as a political radical, because his opposition to capitalism was the reason he had joined the CPUSA.

Moreover, in the elegiac article &quot;The Revolt of the Intellectuals&quot; (&quot;Time&quot; 6 Jan. 1941), the ex-Communist Whittaker Chambers satirically used the term &quot;fellow traveler&quot;:
===Post-World War II U.S.===
In the late 1930s, most fellow-travelers broke with the Communist party-line of Moscow when Stalin and Adolf Hitler signed the German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact (August 1939), which allowed the Occupation of Poland (1939–45) for partitioning between the U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany. In the U.S., the American Communist Party abided Stalin&#x27;s official party-line, and denounced the Allies, rather than the Germans, as war mongers. In June 1941, when the Nazis launched &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;, to annihilate the U.S.S.R., again, the American Communist Party abided Stalin&#x27;s party-line, and became war hawks for American intervention to the European war in aid of Russia, and becoming an ally of the Soviet Union.

At War&#x27;s end, the Russo–American Cold War emerged in the 1946–48 period, and American Communists found themselves at the political margins of U.S. society – such as being forced out of the leadership of trade unions; in turn, membership to the Communist Party of the U.S.A. declined. Yet, in 1948, American Communists did campaign for the presidential run of Henry A. Wallace, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s vice-president. In February 1956, to the 20th congress of the C.P.S.U., Nikita Khrushchev delivered the secret speech, &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, denouncing Stalinism and the cult of personality for Josef Stalin; those political revelations ended the ideological relationship between many fellow-travelers in the West and the Soviet version of Communism.

==== McCarthyism ====
In 1945, the anti-Communist congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) became a permanent committee of the U.S. Congress; and, in 1953, after Senator Joseph McCarthy became chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, they attempted to determine the extent of Soviet influence in the U.S. government, and in the social, cultural, and political institutions of American society.

That seven-year period (1950–56) of moral panic and political witch hunts was the McCarthy Era, characterized by right-wing political orthodoxy. Some targets of investigation were created by way of anonymous and unfounded accusations of treason and subversion, during which time the term &quot;fellow traveler&quot; was applied as a political pejorative against many American citizens who did not outright condemn Communism. Modern critics of HUAC claim that any citizen who did not fit or abide the HUAC&#x27;s ideologically narrow definition of &quot;American&quot; was so labeled – which, they claimed, contradicted, flouted, and voided the political rights provided for every citizen in the U.S. Constitution.

In the course of his political career, the Republican Sen. McCarthy claimed at various times that there were many American citizens (secretly and publicly) sympathetic to Communism and the Soviet Union who worked in the State Department and in the U.S. Army, in positions of trust incompatible with such beliefs. In response to such ideological threats to the national security of the U.S., some American citizens with Communist pasts were suspected of being &quot;un-American&quot; and thus secretly and anonymously registered to a blacklist (particularly in the arts) by their peers, and so denied employment and the opportunity to earn a living, despite many such acknowledged ex-communists moving on from the &quot;fellow traveler&quot; stage of their political lives, such as the Hollywood blacklist.

== Contemporary usages ==
&quot;The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought&quot; (1999), defines the term &quot;fellow-traveller&quot; as a post-revolutionary political term derived from the Russian word &quot;poputchik&quot;, with which the Bolsheviks described political sympathizers who hesitated to publicly support the Bolshevik Party and Communism in Russia, after the Revolution of 1917.

&quot;The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (1993) defines the term &quot;fellow-traveller&quot; as &quot;a non-Communist who sympathizes with the aims and general policies of the Communist Party&quot;; and, by transference, as a &quot;person who sympathizes with, but is not a member of another party or movement&quot;.

&quot;Safire&#x27;s Political Dictionary&quot; (1978), defines the term &quot;fellow traveller&quot; as a man or a woman &quot;who accepted most Communist doctrine, but was not a member of the Communist party&quot;; and, in contemporary usage, defines the term &quot;fellow traveller&quot; as a person &quot;who agrees with a philosophy or group, but does not publicly work for it.&quot;

The Russian word &quot;sputnik&quot; (спутник) also translates, literally (s=with + put=path + nik=a (male) person, thus &quot;someone travelling the same path&quot;) as &quot;fellow traveler&quot;, though most English-speakers only know it as meaning &quot;satellite&quot;.

<text>Siuntio (; ) is a municipality in the Uusimaa region of Southern Finland. Its neighboring municipalities are Ingå to the west, Kirkkonummi to the east, Lohja to the north-west, and Vihti to the north. It is west of Helsinki.

As of 2021, the population was with a population density of . The municipality covers an area of , of which is water.

Siuntio is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages. Previously, the majority of the population spoke Swedish until the 1980s. 

Siuntio&#x27;s motto is &quot;Ota rauhallisestiTa det lugnt&quot;, which means &quot;take it easy&quot; in Finnish and Swedish respectively. The municipality&#x27;s rebranding program introduced the new motto along with a new logo in 2021.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Siuntio has been inhabited since the Stone Age, with the oldest evidence of farming settlements discovered in the river valley around the medieval Siuntio church. Many Bronze Age burial sites can also be found in Siuntio, such as Krejansberget hill and Luntoberget hill near St. Peter&#x27;s Church. Some Iron Age sites, like Ekeberga Burial Site, are also found in the municipality. Apart from burial sites also a prehistoric hill fort, Skällberget, is found opposite to the church. The oldest known document mentioning Siuntio is from 1382. The document addresses a donation to the Church of St. Lawrence in Lohja.

=== The Middle Ages ===
During the Middle Ages two large manor houses, Suitia and Sjundby, were built in Siuntio.

The earliest mention of Suitia Manor is from 1420 in a document addressing a border conflict between Suitia estate and an estate owned by the bailiff of Häme Castle. Later, the estate came to the possession of the Fleming family. Over time, the Flemings acquired new land for the Suitia estate; at one point, Suitia had its own harbor by the sea near the mouth of Pickala river. The Flemings also built the first ironworks in Finland, located on the grounds of Suitia Manor, in the 1530s.

The Sjundby Manor House is first mentioned in a document from 1417. The manor was owned by a number of nobles and royals, including Queen Christina of Sweden.

The stone St. Peter&#x27;s Church was built around 1480 on the site of previous wooden church buildings. The sacristy, the oldest part of the church, and armory were removed after the church caught fire in 1823.

=== 1800–2000 ===
The National Author of Finland, Aleksis Kivi, lived in Siuntio in Fanjunkars croft from 1864 to 1871.

The old municipality center around the church started to lose its significance after the coastal railway was built. The new railway station was built a few kilometers south of the church, which resulted in the creation of the new municipal center around the railway station.

After the Second World War, parts of Southern Siuntio were leased to the Soviet Union as part of the Porkkala Naval Base for 50 years following the 1944 Moscow Armistice between Finland, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. Although the land was returned to Finland in 1956, signs of Soviet occupation can still be found around the area, including military orders written in Cyrillic script on the walls of the dairy house of the Sjundby Manor House and a Soviet Triumphal Arch near Pickala Manor House.

=== 2000–present ===
In 2011 Siuntio, together with the municipalities of Karjalohja, Sammatti and Nummi-Pusula, decided to merge with the city of Lohja starting in 2013. The decision was made following encouragement from the Finnish State to merge smaller municipalities together. The goal was to create larger administrative areas to eventually cut costs. However, the decision caused a conflict between the Siuntio political parties, which also divided the population. After several unclear negotiations, Siuntio failed to deliver any kind of answers and therefore was cut out of the merge with Lohja.

In 2018 Siuntio joined the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority, securing good public transportation connections to Helsinki sub-region.

== Nature and geography ==
The northern part of Siuntio has many high hills and a large esker covered in forest, while the southern part of Siuntio is less hilly but also covered in forests. Smaller and larger lakes can also be found in the southern and middle parts of Siuntio. The western parts of Siuntio have large flat areas of cultivated fields.

Siuntio has also a few Natura 2000 nature protection areas such as the Plytberg Oak Forest, Torsgård&#x27;s old forest, Meiko-Lappträsk lake area and the riverbanks of Siuntio river.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is the largest religious organisation in Siuntio and it is divided into two parishes: The Finnish-speaking parish (&quot;Siuntion suomalainen seurakunta&quot;) and the Swedish-speaking parish (&quot;Sjundeå svenska församling&quot;). Both parishes share the medieval stone church dedicated to St. Peter.

== Sights and cultural heritage ==

=== The Medieval Church of St. Peter ===
The Church of St. Peter in Siuntio was built around the 1480s during Finland&#x27;s Catholic time, and the church still has biblical paintings on its vaults from that era. The oldest objects inside the church are also from the Middle Ages. 
=== Suitia Manor House ===

The Suitia Manor House (Fin. Suitian kartano, Swe. Svidja slott) is a large stone-built manor house built in the 1540s. The walls of the two-storey building are over one meter thick for defensive reasons. The first floor was rebuilt at the beginning of the 1760s by Esbjörn Reuterholm.

The state of Finland sold Suitia to a private owner for 11.7 million euros in 2015. Suitia, together with St. Peter&#x27;s Church, are listed as Nationally Significant Built Cultural Environments and are protected by the Finnish Heritage Agency.
=== Sjundby Manor House ===

The Sjundby Manor House was built in the 1560s by Swedish king Gustav Vasa&#x27;s stall master Jakob Henriksson. The Adlercreutz family has owned Sjundby since the 18th century and tours inside the castle are arranged during summer.

Sjundby was on the Soviet side of the border during the Soviet lease of Porkkala Naval Base. During this period, the house was badly damaged but was eventually restored. Writings in Cyrillic script instructing how Soviet soldiers should behave can still be seen on the walls of the Sjundby dairy house.

Sjundby is listed as a Nationally Significant Built Cultural Environment and is protected by the Finnish Heritage Agency.

=== Pickala Manor House and Soviet Triumphal Arch ===

The Pickala Manor House was on the Soviet side of the border during the leasing of Porkkala Naval Base. Near the manor house runs a cobblestone road, known as the Kabanov&#x27;s road, which runs from Pickala to a Soviet triumphal arch, the only surviving Soviet Triumphal arch in Finland. The road was paved with cobblestone to make it strong enough for Soviet military vehicles to drive on.

Pickala Manor House and its surroundings are listed as Nationally Significant Built Cultural Environment and protected by the Finnish Heritage Agency.

=== Tjusterby Manor House ===
The Tjusterby Manor House was one of the oldest wooden manor houses in Siuntio. The house was located near the church in the Tjusterby hamlet. The Manor House was moved from Helsinki to Siuntio in the late 19th century. Tjusterby Manor was destroyed in a large fire in 2011.

=== Gårdskulla Manor and Agricultural Museum ===
Gårdskulla Manor is one of the largest farms in Finland with about 680 hectares of land. The main building is from the 1850s. Gårdskulla has a large collection of agricultural artefacts shown in its private museum. Over 100 old tractors, some cars, tools and steam machines are shown there.

=== Siuntio Local History Museum ===

Siuntio local history museum, located in Siuntio Church Village, hosts permanent exhibitions regarding the local history and heritage of the municipality all the way from prehistory to modern-day independent Finland.

=== Fanjunkars ===

=== Coat of Arms ===

The coat of arms of Siuntio is the heraldic symbol of the municipality. It was designed by A. W. Rancken and approved by the Ministry of the Interior on 22nd April 1950. The subject of the coat of arms is a key between two wavy beams. The key symbolises St. Peter who is the patron saint of the medieval stone church of Siuntio. The colours of the coat of arms are similar to the coat of arms of Uusimaa region. The official heraldic explanation of the coat of arms is: In a blue field, a horizontally positioned golden key, with a cross in the shaft and the handle designed as a quadrilateral, between two bars of silver which form wave-like patterns.

<doc id="784363" wikidata="Q559622" url="?curid=784363" title="Joseph Albo">
<text>Joseph Albo (; c. 1380–1444) was a Jewish philosopher and rabbi who lived in Spain during the fifteenth century, known chiefly as the author of &quot;Sefer ha-Ikkarim&quot; (&quot;Book of Principles&quot;), the classic work on the fundamentals of Judaism.

==Biography==
Albo&#x27;s birthplace is generally assumed to be Monreal del Campo, a town in Aragon. This is based on Astruc ha-Levi&#x27;s report of the religious debate held at Tortosa in 1413-14, which mentions Albo as one of the Jewish participants and notes he was the delegate of the congregation of Monreal. However, the Latin account of this debate makes no reference to this locality.

Heinrich Graetz believes that Albo could not have been less than thirty years of age when he was sent to take part in the disputation, and he accordingly places the date of Albo&#x27;s birth not later than 1380. His date of death is given variously as 1444 (most likely) or 1430. He is mentioned, however, as preaching at Soria in 1433.

The use Albo makes of medical illustrations creates the presumption that he was adept in medical science, which suggests that he may have practiced medicine. He was versed to some degree in the writings of Arab Aristotelians. His teacher was Hasdai Crescas, author of &quot;Or Adonai.&quot; Opinions vary on whether Crescas was still alive when &quot;Sefer HaIkkarim&quot; was published.

==&quot;Sefer ha-Ikkarim&quot;==
Albo is best known for his philosophical work, &quot;Sefer ha-Ikkarim&quot; (&quot;Book of Principles&quot;), completed in 1425 in Soria.

There are unique nature sights in the municipality of Sonkajärvi, for example the northernmost in Finland reliably confirmed habitats of wild small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) in the vicinity of the lake of Kangaslampi, 63° 45′ N and near the hill of Salmisenmäki, 63° 43′ 42&quot; N.

==History==

The municipality was founded in 1922. Before it Sonkajärvi was a part of Iisalmen maalaiskunta.

==Transport==
Highway 5 (E63) is located about west of the center of Sonkajärvi.

==Wife carrying competition==
Sonkajärvi has gained a worldwide fame for the alternative sport of wife-carrying ( or &quot;&quot;). The first Wife Carrying World Championship dates to 1994, but the creation of the contest, apart from its humorous aspects, has deep roots in the local history. In the late 19th century there was in the area a brigand called Rosvo-Ronkainen, who is said to have accepted in his troops only those men who proved their worth on a challenging track. In those days, it was also a common practice to steal women from the neighbouring villages.

In the Wife Carrying competition each team has one male and one female member, the objective being for the male to carry the female through a special obstacle track. The basic rules are that the woman must be over 17 years of age and have a weight of at least . If she is below that weight, she must be burdened with such a heavy rucksack so that the total weight to be carried by the man is at least 49 kilograms. The only equipment allowed is a belt worn by the carrier and a helmet worn by the carried. The track in Sonkajärvi used annually for the World Championship is long.

<text>Stuart Richard Abbott MBE (born 3 June 1978) is a South African born rugby union footballer who played centre for London Wasps and England.

Abbott was born in Cape Town, South Africa. His mother was English. He was educated at Western Province Prep School and Bishops, where he says he was caned. Springbok centre Robbie Fleck, and Selborne Boome went to the same school. He took a degree in economics at Stellenbosch University and played for the Northern Free State Griffons in the Currie Cup. He later played for Western Province and South Africa U23

During the 1999 World Cup, Abbott signed for English club Leicester Tigers, who had lost several players to international duty, and made two appearances, on the recommendation of former Tigers and Springbok fly-half Joel Stransky.

In 2001 he played for the South African Super 12 side Stormers. In November 2001 Abbott was signed by English club Wasps. He rocketed to prominence in 2002–03 as a prime force in the team that won the Zurich Premiership, he repeated this for 2003–04 when the club reached the finals of both the Heineken Cup and the end-of-season Zurich Premiership playoffs. Wasps won both finals and Abbott scored a try in both. He formed an exciting centre partnership with Fraser Waters.

He turned down an approach from South Africa coach Rudolf Straeuli prior to the World Cup but decided to play for England. Abbott scored on his England debut when he scored one of the five tries in England&#x27;s 43–9 Rugby World Cup warm up match with Wales at the Millennium Stadium in August 2003. After impressing again in a pre-World Cup trial against France two weeks later, was selected in England&#x27;s World Cup squad.

In 2003, he appeared in three Rugby World Cup games, adding a second try in the runaway win over Uruguay. England went on to win the World Cup and with his teammates Abbott was appointed an MBE in the 2004 New Year Honours. He missed out on the 2004 Six Nations Championship through injury but showed his class for his club, earning his call up for the 2004 summer tour. He struggled with injuries after the World Cup and broke his leg in 2005 in a Heineken Cup game between Wasps and Biarritz.
He enjoyed a very successful period at London Wasps winning the Heineken Cup, Zurich Premiership and in his last season there, the Powergen Cup.

In 2006, he joined the newly promoted Harlequins for the 2006–07 season, but only made 17 appearances for them. On 24 October 2007 Abbott announced his retirement due to a shoulder injury.

In May 2008 Abbott was announced Backs Coach at Rosslyn Park FC, who finished second in the 2008/2009 season.

<text>Hampton Court Maze is a hedge maze at Hampton Court Palace and the oldest surviving hedge maze in Britain.

Commissioned by King William III, the maze, which is about one-third of an acre, is planted in a trapezoid shape and was designed by George London and Henry Wise. It was located in the &quot;wilderness&quot; part of the gardens of the palace, of which it is now the only surviving part. Planted between 1689 and 1695, the maze is not particularly difficult, taking about 20 minutes for a person to make their way to the middle. It was originally planted in hornbeam, later replaced by yew.

Psychologist Edmund Sanford took inspiration from the Hampton Court Maze in his idea to create mazes for laboratory rats to study learning. The maze is referenced in some works of literature, including humorist Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889) and Carol Shields&#x27; &quot;Larry&#x27;s Party&quot; (1997), and is referenced in the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode &quot;Three Men, a Woman and a Baby&quot;. It also serves as the inspiration for the maze at Mayer&#x27;s Nest in Ian Martin&#x27;s &quot;Nightmare Nest&quot; broadcast for the CBS Radio Mystery Theater in 1975.

<text>Bettino Ricasoli, 1st Count of Brolio, 2nd Baron Ricasoli (; 9 March 180923 October 1880) was an Italian statesman. He was a central figure in the politics of Italy during and after the unification of Italy. He led the Moderate Party.

==Biography==
Ricasoli was born in Florence. Left an orphan at eighteen, with an estate heavily in debt, he was by special decree of the grand duke of Tuscany declared of age and entrusted with the guardianship of his younger brothers. He was Catholic.

Interrupting his studies, he withdrew to Brolio, and by careful management disencumbered the family possessions. In 1847 he founded the journal &quot;La Patria&quot;, and addressed to the grand duke a memorial suggesting remedies for the difficulties of the state. In 1848 he was elected &quot;Gonfaloniere&quot; of Florence, but resigned on account of the anti-Liberal tendencies of the grand duke.

As Tuscan minister of the interior in 1859 he promoted the union of Tuscany with Piedmont, which took place on March 12, 1860. Elected Italian deputy in 1861, he succeeded Cavour in the premiership. As premier he admitted the Garibaldian volunteers to the regular army, revoked the decree of exile against Mazzini, and attempted reconciliation with the Vatican; but his efforts were rendered ineffectual by the &quot;non possumus&quot; of the pope.

Disdainful of the intrigues of his rival Rattazzi, he found himself obliged in 1862 to resign office, but returned to power in 1866. On this occasion he refused Napoleon III&#x27;s offer to cede Venetia to Italy, on condition that Italy should abandon the Prussian alliance, and also refused the Prussian decoration of the Black Eagle because La Marmora, author of the alliance, was not to receive it.

Upon the departure of the French troops from Rome at the end of 1866 he again attempted to conciliate the Vatican with a convention, in virtue of which Italy would have restored to the Church the property of the suppressed religious orders in return for the gradual payment of 24,000,000. In order to mollify the Vatican he conceded the exequatur to forty-five bishops inimical to the Italian régime. The Vatican accepted his proposal, but the Italian Chamber proved refractory, and, though dissolved by Ricasoli, returned more hostile than before. Without waiting for a vote, Ricasoli resigned office and thenceforward practically disappeared from political life, speaking in the Chamber only upon rare occasions. He died at his Castello di Brolio on 23 October 1880.

The barone created the modern recipe of Chianti wine; though a formula of specific grape percentages is often erroneously attributed to him, his switch in focus to Sangiovese as the lead grape in the blend would have lasting implications for both Tuscan and Italian wine. The family named firm (Ricasoli 1141) still produces wine at Brolio.

His private life and public career were marked by the utmost integrity, and by a rigid austerity which earned him the name of the Iron Baron. In spite of the failure of his ecclesiastical scheme, he remains one of the most noteworthy figures of the Italian &quot;Risorgimento&quot;.

<doc id="784404" wikidata="Q849496" url="?curid=784404" title="D-Generation X">
<text>D-Generation X (DX), is an American professional wrestling stable, and later a tag team, who consisted of various members mostly Generation X wrestlers, most notably Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Chyna, X-Pac, and the New Age Outlaws, a tag team consisting of Road Dogg and Billy Gunn.

The group originated in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE) shortly before the &quot;Attitude Era&quot; in 1997 as a foil to another prominent faction, The Hart Foundation and became one of the main driving forces behind the WWF competing with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the Monday Night War. In addition to two other founding members, Chyna and Rick Rude, the group later expanded with new additions X-Pac, The New Age Outlaws, and Tori until the group officially disbanded in August 2000. After a teased reunion in 2002, DX reformed in June 2006 as the duo of Triple H and Shawn Michaels for the remainder of the year and again in August 2009 until March 2010, shortly before Michaels&#x27; retirement. This incarnation was voted the greatest WWE Tag Team Champions of all time in a 2013 WWE viewer poll. Today, most of its members are active in the day-to-day operations of the WWE, such as Levesque, who serves as the chief content officer and head of creative, while Michaels serves as Senior Vice President of Talent Development Creative overseeing the NXT brand and James holds the role as the Senior Vice President of Live Events.

On October 8, 2018, it was announced that DX would face The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) at the Crown Jewel pay-per view. At Crown Jewel, Triple H and Michaels were victorious against The Undertaker and Kane. On February 18, 2019, it was announced that the group would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame later that year, with Triple H, Michaels, Chyna, The New Age Outlaws, and X-Pac as the inducted members.

== Concept ==
The group&#x27;s gimmick was best known as a gang of rebels who broke the rules, acted and spoke as they pleased, and wrestled whomever they wanted no matter how provocative and insulting. Noted for their crude, profane humor and sophomoric pranks, the stable has been dubbed multiple times as the &quot;most controversial group in WWF/E history&quot;. Michaels&#x27; autobiography suggests that it was WWF head writer Vince Russo who first conceived the moniker for the faction, while Bret Hart claims it originated from &quot;New York Post&quot; columnist Phil Mushnick, a frequent critic of the WWF. Triple H also claims that Shane McMahon coined the name of D-Generation X when responding to Bret Hart&#x27;s characterization of younger wrestlers as degenerates.

DX was one of the three main contributing factors, along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, to the onset of the WWF&#x27;s Attitude Era. WWF/E Chairman Vince McMahon has repeatedly denied that DX was inspired or heavily influenced by World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (WCW) New World Order (nWo), though the core members of both on-screen factions included members of The Kliq; (Sean Waltman even served as a member of both groups; as did Michaels, briefly, during the nWo&#x27;s short-lived revival in the WWF/E in 2002). On October 6, 1997, in one of the earliest DX promos, Michaels alluded to this off-screen connection. After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have &quot;run Scott Hall and Kevin Nash outta town&quot; (referring to Hall and Nash leaving the WWF and signing with WCW), Michaels declared, &quot;The Kliq owns this professional wrestling business&quot;, and said that the group had simply undergone &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;destruction&quot;.

== History ==

=== Formation and early rivalries (1997–1998) ===

According to Triple H, WWF management wanted to keep The Kliq apart on-screen, so they were hesitant to pair he and Michaels together at first. Despite this, the group began to form during the August 11, 1997 main event of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. During Michaels&#x27; match with Mankind, Triple H (then wrestling under the ring name of Hunter Hearst Helmsley) and Chyna both interfered, as Helmsley had been recently feuding with Mankind; the end of the match also saw Rick Rude return to the WWF revealing himself as Michaels&#x27; &quot;insurance policy&quot;, helping Michaels win the match by attacking Mankind with a chair. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels and Helmsley teamed up to take on Mankind and The Undertaker in the main event, only to lose the match by disqualification after Michaels used a chair on Undertaker. Michaels would eventually face the Undertaker at Ground Zero: In Your House on September 7 with Helmsley, Chyna and Rude all interfering on Michaels&#x27; behalf to force the match to end in a no contest. During this time, the group (Michaels and Helmsley in particular) were regularly shown on television practicing sophomoric/crude humor and rebelling against authority figures in the company, primarily Vince McMahon (then primarily presented as an on-screen commentator) and then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter, the latter of which DX made a recurring habit of humiliating by giving him the nickname &quot;Sgt. Slobber&quot;.

D-Generation X&#x27;s first major feud was against the Hart Foundation, which was led by Michaels&#x27; nemesis Bret Hart. At WWF One Night Only, the rest of DX helped Michaels defeat Foundation member British Bulldog for the WWF European Championship, officially making Michaels the WWF&#x27;s first Grand Slam Champion. On-screen, the name was taken from comments by Hart, who on several occasions, particularly including the October 6, 1997 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, had labeled Michaels &quot;nothing more than a degenerate&quot;. The following week, on October 13, 1997, Michaels made &quot;D-Generation X&quot; the group&#x27;s official name, mockingly citing Hart&#x27;s insults as his inspiration and how Generation X (with both members being part of Generation X) is always stereotyped as apathetic and cynical.

Although DX and the members of The Hart Foundation continued to battle on-screen in one fashion or another through the end of 1997, the Bret Hart-Shawn Michaels feud ended abruptly at Survivor Series when Michaels won his third WWF Championship via the Montreal Screwjob, whereby Hart was lied to about the match&#x27;s pre-determined outcome after Hart had signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and refused to drop the WWF Championship to Michaels in Canada and instead agreed to drop the title one month later in Springfield, Massachusetts. Rick Rude was also legitimately upset over the events of the screwjob, and subsequently left the WWF to return to WCW. On the November 24 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, DX invited Jim &quot;The Anvil&quot; Neidhart to join the group, which he accepted prior to a match later that night between Vader and Michaels. Michaels, Chyna and Helmsley assaulted Neidhart at the end of the show after Michaels defeated Vader, showing that Neidhart&#x27;s invitation to the group was nothing more than a ruse. The following week on the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Helmsley defeated Neidhart. After the match, DX assaulted Neidhart once again, before Michaels spray-painted &quot;WCW&quot; on Neidhart&#x27;s back, signifying him following Bret Hart and The British Bulldog to WCW. Sgt. Slaughter and Ken Shamrock saved Neidhart, before Slaughter and Shamrock attacked DX at the end of the show.

D-Generation X was used as the title for a WWF D-Generation X: In Your House pay-per-view telecast on December 7, 1997. By this point, with Michaels holding both the WWF and WWF European Championships, and DX&#x27;s victory in the feud with the Hart Foundation, their status as the lead stable in the company was solidified. Michaels headlined the event and was disqualified in a WWF Championship title defense against Ken Shamrock after interference from Helmsley and Chyna. After the match, Owen Hart interfered, having not been seen on WWF television since Survivor Series, starting a feud between Owen and DX. Earlier in the night, Helmsley (now primarily wrestling under the ring name of Triple H) defeated Sgt. Slaughter with the help of Chyna in a Boot Camp match. On the December 22 episode of &quot;Raw is War,&quot; however, Michaels and Triple H were forced by Slaughter to wrestle each other for the European Championship. In a mock match, Michaels laid down in the middle of the ring while Triple H constantly ran the ropes. Triple H would then pin Michaels and win the European Championship.

Triple H lost the European Championship to Owen Hart in January 1998 only to regain it two months later. Going into WrestleMania XIV that March, Shawn Michaels was the reigning WWF Champion and Triple H was the reigning WWF European Champion. Heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson was also involved as the &quot;special enforcer&quot; in the main event of the night featuring Michaels against Stone Cold Steve Austin. In the weeks leading up to the event, Tyson was revealed to have joined D-Generation X, and looked as if he was going to help Michaels retain the championship. However, at the end of the match, Tyson turned on DX and cost Michaels the match and the WWF Championship, allowing Austin to win the title.

=== Michaels&#x27; departure and &quot;DX Army&quot; (1998–1999) ===
The night after WrestleMania, Triple H officially ejected Michaels from DX for &quot;dropping the ball&quot; over the Tyson incident and subsequently losing the WWF Championship. In reality, Michaels had suffered a severe back injury during his Casket Match with The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble, and started what would become a four-year hiatus from wrestling to recuperate. Triple H would assume full leadership of DX and recruited X-Pac, who had been recently fired from WCW, and the current WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws (&quot;Bad Ass&quot; Billy Gunn and &quot;The Road Dogg&quot; Jesse James) into the stable. Triple H would dub this iteration as his new &quot;DX Army&quot;. While the intent was for the stable to remain heels, they quickly became popular with audiences and were eventually pushed as faces. During this time, they feuded with The Rock and his group The Nation and then later, Vince McMahon&#x27;s Corporation. The group remained united throughout 1998 and into early 1999.

On episodes of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in April and May DX &quot;went to war&quot; with WCW, with whom the WWF were in direct competition at the time, through a series of legitimate visits to WCW headquarters and live events. On April 27, 1998, &quot;Raw Is War&quot; and &quot;Nitro&quot; both took place in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, a mere 19 miles apart. DX traveled from the WWF show in Hampton Coliseum in Hampton to The Scope in Norfolk and shouted insults against WCW through a bullhorn, as well as accusing WCW of giving out free tickets to fill up arenas for television while sporting black armbands with the acronym &quot;POWCW&quot; (Prisoner of WCW), which referenced fellow Kliq members Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. DX then tried to enter the arena via a loading dock in their army jeep before being stopped by someone closing the door. They also attempted to forcibly secure meetings with Nitro&#x27;s executive producer Eric Bischoff and WCW owner Ted Turner at WCW headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Another segment used computer graphics to make it appear as if Triple H had flown over the Roberts Municipal Stadium in Evansville, Indiana where WCW Nitro was taking place and wrote &quot;WCW Sucks&quot; and &quot;DX Says Suck It&quot; in the sky.
The group also feuded with the new Corporate Commissioner, former DX leader Shawn Michaels, who had turned heel and betrayed the group after costing X-Pac a WWF Championship match against The Rock. The faction would continue to feud with Michaels and The Corporation throughout late 1998, with Michaels reversing Billy Gunn&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship victory against Ken Shamrock, costing The Outlaws the Tag Team Titles and even managing to seemingly lure the New Age Outlaws to The Corporation on the December 7 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. However, the Outlaws quickly revealed this to have been a ruse, turning on The Corporation that same night. When The Corporation turned on Michaels in January 1999, he was taken in by DX once more. This too was short lived, as later that night DX were instrumental in Michaels being ambushed by The Corporation, with X-Pac commenting &quot;What goes around, comes around&quot;.

Some of the group&#x27;s most memorable promos were their parodies of their rivals. On July 6, 1998, DX carried out the first of these segments, where they mocked and parodied The Nation, with Triple H mocking The Rock as &quot;The Crock&quot;; Road Dogg playing the part of D&#x27;Lo Brown as &quot;B&#x27;Lo&quot;; Billy Gunn as The Godfather; X-Pac as a parody of Mark Henry, going by &quot;Mizark&quot;; and comedian Jason Sensation as Owen Hart. On December 14, 1998, they would turn their attention to The Corporation with Triple H again appearing as &quot;The Crock&quot;; Road Dogg playing Mr. McMahon (with two midgets representing Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson kissing his behind throughout); Billy Gunn, playing Shane McMahon wearing an adult diaper; X-Pac playing Ken Shamrock; Chyna as The Big Boss Man; and Sensation returning to play Michaels. These parodies would also be resurrected during the fourth incarnation. X-Pac&#x27;s parody of Mark Henry has been seen as highly controversial due to him being in blackface (unlike the rest of DX); X-Pac would admit on his podcast in 2018 that it was one of his biggest career regrets, despite having Henry&#x27;s personal blessing to do the segment.

Throughout 1999, the members would gradually turn on one another, leading to the group officially disbanding for the first time. Initially, Chyna turned on Triple H and X-Pac and joined the Corporation on January 25. At WrestleMania XV, Chyna turned on then fellow Corporation member Kane, helping Triple H to defeat him, and seemingly rejoining DX. Later that night, however, Triple H and Chyna interfered in X-Pac&#x27;s European Championship match with Shane McMahon. Initially, it appeared that they were there to help X-Pac, but Triple H quickly turned on him, delivering a Pedigree to his stablemate, costing him the match. Chyna and Triple H would then join The Corporation, with Kane subsequently being ousted. As a result, X-Pac began to share a bond with Kane, which resulted in Kane becoming a close ally of the faction, and the duo would hold the WWF Tag Team Championship on two occasions.

Though the group maintained a united front against The Corporation, Billy Gunn would become frustrated at Kane&#x27;s presence, as well as The New Age Outlaws&#x27; inability to win the Tag Team Championships from X-Pac and Kane. Following one such defeat on the April 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Gunn became angry at X-Pac. The following week on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, he apologized to X-Pac, but attacked him when X-Pac&#x27;s back was turned, citing his frustration at being &quot;held back&quot; and departing from D-Generation X, therefore reducing the remaining members to just Road Dogg and X-Pac. Over the following weeks, Gunn would continue to attack X-Pac and Road Dogg, often being chased away by Kane. In July, Triple H and Chyna told Billy Gunn that Road Dogg and X-Pac were making a lot more money from DX&#x27;s royalties than the other three (due to them still using the name as a tag team). This would lead to a tag match at Fully Loaded, in which the winners would get the rights to use the DX name, which Road Dogg and X-Pac won. Though not officially a member, upon winning the Tag Team titles from The Acolytes on August 9, Kane, under encouragement from partner X-Pac, uttered his first on-screen words without help from a voice box, saying &quot;suck it&quot;.

=== Reformation and McMahon-Helmsley Era (1999–2000) ===
On October 25, the group reformed as villains when Triple H and X-Pac helped the New Age Outlaws – who had reunited the previous month – defeat Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. Later that week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, X-Pac suggested that DX would get &quot;bigger&quot;, hinting that Kane would finally become an official member. However, later that night, he turned on Kane following a match with The Dudley Boyz, stating there would be no additional members and starting a feud between the two. That same night, DX were &quot;hunted&quot; by Austin, with Stone Cold catching Road Dogg in a bear trap, Billy Gunn in a snare trap, having a portion of the backstage ceiling fall on X-Pac and finally catching the whole group in a net. Despite this, The Outlaws won their fifth Tag Team Championship soon afterward, defeating Mankind and Al Snow on the November 8 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;. Not participating in the reunited DX were Chyna who was in a feud with Chris Jericho for the Intercontinental Championship; Shawn Michaels, who was in the middle of a four-year hiatus from wrestling; and Rick Rude, who had died in April 1999.

Triple H, meanwhile, would escalate an ongoing feud with Vince McMahon on the November 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when he interrupted the wedding of Stephanie McMahon and Test to reveal that he had already married Stephanie at a Las Vegas drive-through wedding chapel while she was supposedly drugged unconscious. Triple H would then defeat Vince in a street fight at Armageddon after Stephanie turned on her father and embraced her then-storyline husband. The two revealed the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; that the ceremony, as well as Stephanie being under the influence, was a ruse as part of a revenge plot for Vince orchestrating Stephanie&#x27;s abduction by the Ministry earlier in the year. This officially marked the beginning of the McMahon-Helmsley Era, with Stephanie becoming an official member of DX through her ties to Triple H.

When Kane&#x27;s storyline girlfriend Tori began to get involved in the feud between Kane and X-Pac, Triple H and Stephanie punished her by scheduling Tori in a match with X-Pac on the December 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after which they would grant Kane a WWF Championship match against The Big Show on the December 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; wherei if Kane lost, Tori would have to spend Christmas with X-Pac. The New Age Outlaws distracted Kane, costing him the match. When Tori returned, she insisted that X-Pac had been a perfect gentleman.
By January 2000, Triple H had dubbed himself &quot;The Game&quot;, after stating he was above the top of the wrestling world (as in not merely the &quot;best in the game&quot;, but in fact &quot;the game&quot; itself) and was nicknamed &quot;The Cerebral Assassin&quot; by Jim Ross. On the January 3 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Triple H defeated Big Show to win his third WWF Championship.
Meanwhile, storylines implied that X-Pac had truly done something harmful to Tori when she started appearing as neurotic and paranoid, with many WWF superstars using Tori&#x27;s mental state to provoke Kane into attacking their enemies over the ensuing month. X-Pac also gave Tori an apparently forced kiss during his match with Kane on the January 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. This storyline culminated on the January 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, when DX jumped Kane during another match against Big Show, leading to a promo in which X-Pac recounted his Christmas rendezvous with Tori; Tori then passionately kissed X-Pac, turning on Kane and joining DX in the process. Throughout this period, DX would feud with the likes of The Rock, Mankind/Cactus Jack, Chris Jericho, Kane and the other McMahons, primarily securing and protecting Triple H&#x27;s WWF Championship as well as The Outlaws&#x27; WWF Tag Team Championship. They would also arrive at arenas in a tour bus called &quot;The DX Express&quot;.

During a match at No Way Out where The Outlaws lost the Tag Team Championship to The Dudley Boyz, Gunn suffered a torn rotator cuff which would place him out of action for several months. On-screen, to explain his impending absence to recover from his injury, Gunn&#x27;s storyline involved him getting thrown out of DX because &quot;he lost his cool&quot; when Triple H had X-Pac take his place in the rematch. X-Pac teamed with Road Dogg once again, but the two never reached the heights the New Age Outlaws had. On March 30, X-Pac and Tori assisted Stephanie McMahon in winning the Women&#x27;s Championship from Jacqueline. At WrestleMania 2000, Triple H defended his title in a fatal four-way elimination match against The Rock, Mick Foley, and Big Show, with a separate McMahon appearing in every superstar&#x27;s corner. Vince McMahon turned on The Rock and aided Triple H in retaining his title. DX would then unite with Vince and Shane&#x27;s Corporation stable, and the resulting group was officially dubbed The McMahon-Helmsley Regime. On April 27, Stone Cold Steve Austin used a crane to drop a steel beam on the DX Express tour bus, causing the bus to explode in the parking lot.
The Rock defeated Triple H for the WWF Championship at Backlash in a match which featured Stone Cold Steve Austin&#x27;s brief return to the WWF. Though Triple H regained the title the following month at Judgment Day, the group gradually broke apart. Road Dogg and X-Pac became frustrated by their lack of success as a tag team and turned on each other, culminating in a match at SummerSlam, which X-Pac won. By late 2000, Triple H had become a solo star, and even briefly turned face during a love triangle storyline involving Stephanie and Kurt Angle. Billy Gunn, meanwhile, had returned to action and struck a partnership with Chyna following the dissolution of her storyline relationship with Eddie Guerrero.

On the November 6, 2000 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Chyna, Road Dogg, Billy Gunn, and Triple H reunited to take on The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn) in an eight-person tag team match, which they won. The match included the group doing their old DX entrance, as well as telling the crowd to &quot;suck it!&quot; This reunion would be short-lived however, as on that very same episode, Triple H turned heel when he attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin and revealed himself as the mastermind behind Austin&#x27;s hit-and-run assault at the Survivor Series the year before. Chyna and Gunn, along with Road Dogg and his new tag team partner K-Kwik, continued to feud with The Radicalz that month, leading to a match at Survivor Series, which The Radicalz would win.

=== Shawn Michaels&#x27; return and feud with Triple H (2002–2004) ===
After November 2000, DX remained unseen and largely unmentioned until Shawn Michaels returned to WWE in the summer of 2002. Michaels persuaded then-&quot;Raw&quot; General Manager Eric Bischoff to sign Triple H to a &quot;Raw&quot; contract as part of the &quot;Brand Extension&quot; at Vengeance. The following night on the July 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; (Shawn Michaels&#x27; 37th birthday), a week after the breakup of the nWo, Triple H handed Michaels a DX T-shirt and stated that he &quot;had an idea&quot;, suggesting that the two reform the group and make Eric Bischoff&#x27;s life a living hell. The duo later came out that night to their old music, crotch chops, and pyro to the delight of the crowd. However, Triple H turned on Michaels that same night; he had teased the reunion as a ploy to appease Michaels and lure him to the ring before giving him a Pedigree, making Triple H a heel once again. This act led to the in-ring return of Michaels at SummerSlam in 2002 and was the genesis of a long feud between the two that ended with Triple H emerging victorious in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood in 2004.

=== Later reformations (2006–2010, 2018) ===
In 2006, a series of events began occurring which hinted at a DX reunion. At WrestleMania 22, former members Shawn Michaels and Triple H performed the group&#x27;s signature crotch chop during their respective matches (the former against Mr. McMahon, and the latter against John Cena for the WWE Championship), which was met with loud cheering from the fans in attendance. The two continued to deliver chops in the following episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; as Michaels feuded with Vince and Shane McMahon and Triple H focused on the WWE Championship, repeatedly running into the McMahons in the process.
On the June 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the events came to a head. During Triple H&#x27;s gauntlet match against The Spirit Squad, Shawn Michaels came in to help his former friend. After the duo had laid out the entire Spirit Squad, the two men put aside their past rivalry and officially reformed. DX continued their brash antics at the expense of the Spirit Squad, the McMahons, and Jonathan Coachman for several weeks and repeatedly took part in blatantly camp product placement during &quot;Raw&quot; promos. DX would defeat the Spirit Squad in a 5-on-2 handicap match at Vengeance, with Michaels forcing Mitch’s face into Triple H’s buttocks after the match concluded. Most of their antics now involved practical jokes on Vince.

On the June 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX added to the list of parodies with Triple H impersonating Vince McMahon, talking about his love of &quot;Dicks&quot; (a double entendre referring to Dick Ebersol, Dick Clark, and Dick Cheney, as well as the male member; this was also used again repeatedly with roosters, saying that Vince loved &quot;cocks&quot;), while Michaels impersonated Shane McMahon, dancing around the ring until &quot;Vince&quot; screamed at him to &quot;STOP IT!&quot; When Vince, Shane, and the Spirit Squad came to confront them, the contents of a port-a-potty were promptly dumped on them.

On the July 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as a result of their actions on June 26, Vince banned DX from the arena; DX responded by hijacking the production truck and performing a series of pranks on Mr. McMahon, including focusing a camera on McMahon in a public restroom, which was also shown on the &quot;Raw&quot; Titantron; as well as tampering with his microphone. At the end of the episode, as Vince tried to leave in his limousine, fireworks were activated inside the limousine, shooting out of the moon roof, causing a dazed Vince to crawl out covered in soot, at which point DX greeted him with sparklers, wishing him a &quot;Happy 4th of July&quot;.

On the August 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX repeatedly vandalized Vince&#x27;s property by &quot;DX&quot; on Vince&#x27;s $30 million private jet, in front of the WWE World Headquarters building, and finally on Vince&#x27;s limousine (as well as tying a chain to the back axle of the limousine, causing the axle to be violently pulled off when Vince and Shane tried to leave).

During their feud, DX defeated the Spirit Squad at Vengeance and on the July 15, 2006 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, as well as The McMahons (Vince and Shane) at SummerSlam. At Unforgiven in a handicap Hell in a Cell match that featured Big Show on The McMahons&#x27; side, DX again came out victorious.

DX&#x27;s next feud was against Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). At Cyber Sunday, the fans selected Eric Bischoff over Vince McMahon and Jonathan Coachman to be the special guest referee for the match. Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a steel chair to give Rated-RKO the win, marking DX&#x27;s first defeat as a tag team since their reunion in June 2006. At Survivor Series, Michaels and Triple H got back at Edge and Orton by leading Team DX (Triple H, Michaels, Matt and Jeff Hardy, and CM Punk) to a 5–0 sweep over Team Rated-RKO (Edge, Orton, Gregory Helms, Johnny Nitro, and Mike Knox). In 2007, DX challenged for the World Tag Team Championship against Edge and Orton at New Year&#x27;s Revolution. The fight ended in a no contest after Michaels hit the referee. During the match, Triple H suffered a legitimate torn quadriceps, which would put him out of action for 7 months. After the match, DX beat down Rated-RKO with steel chairs and on the announce tables.

After Triple H&#x27;s injury, Shawn Michaels continued to uphold the DX image by himself leading into WrestleMania 23. Michaels would still come to the ring with the DX music and attire, even though Triple H was not joining him during this period. During this time, Michaels captured the World Tag Team Championship with John Cena, as well as earning the right to face Cena at WrestleMania 23 for the WWE Championship. It was confirmed in later interviews and documentaries that original plans called for Triple H to challenge Cena for the championship prior to his injury, after which Michaels was substituted in Triple H&#x27;s place. Michaels would continue to use the D-Generation X motif until Backlash, at which point he reverted to his traditional entrance music and attire, thus ending this incarnation of DX. Michaels and Triple H teamed up again as DX on the January 28, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; defeating Umaga and Snitsky. Despite DX reforming for one night only, both Triple H and Shawn Michaels would periodically use the &quot;crotch chop&quot; during their solo runs.

On the September 29, 2008 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H and Shawn Michaels once again reunited as DX to take on Chris Jericho and Lance Cade. They won by disqualification, due to Cade and Jericho&#x27;s two-on-one assault of Michaels. After being mocked by John Morrison and the Miz for two weeks, on the 800th episode celebration of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX defeated the duo. During the Christmas season, DX appeared in numerous vignettes to promote DX clothing and other WWE merchandise; one such commercial also featured Kelly Kelly. In the 2009 WWE draft on April 13, 2009, Triple H was drafted back to the Raw brand.

In the midst of Triple H rejoining &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels took a brief hiatus from WWE after losing to The Undertaker at WrestleMania 25. Meanwhile, Triple H was embroiled in a rivalry with Randy Orton and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase). The feud continued throughout the summer with Triple H mainly combating with Orton over the WWE Championship. Eventually, Triple H would begin to target The Legacy because they were responsible for his losses against Orton during matches. After losing a handicap match to The Legacy, Triple H stated that he would &quot;make a phone call&quot; to Michaels in the hopes of reuniting DX. On the August 10, 2009 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, video segments aired in which Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he was working as a chef; throughout the segments, Triple H would try to convince Michaels to return to WWE and reform DX. After several incidents during the segments (including a grease fire and Shawn getting shouted at by a little girl), Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy at SummerSlam, superkicking the girl, and quitting his chef job in the process.
On the August 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Michaels and Triple H officially reunited as DX, but as they were in the middle of their in-ring promo, Legacy attacked them both. Their first match after reuniting was against Legacy at SummerSlam, which they won. At Breaking Point, however, they lost to Legacy in the first ever Submissions Count Anywhere match in WWE history. The following month at Hell in Cell, DX defeated Legacy in a Hell in a Cell match. DX would go on to challenge John Cena for the WWE Championship in a triple threat match at Survivor Series with both men failing to win the title, although they were able to retain their friendship and tag team partnership. On December 13 at , DX defeated Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and Big Show) to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; the first tag team championship reign for Michaels and Triple H as a tag team.

On December 21, 2009, Triple H announced that Hornswoggle was the new DX &quot;mascot&quot;. This came about after Hornswoggle sued DX for emotional and physical distress due to them not allowing him to join the group. After being taken to &quot;Little People&#x27;s Court&quot;, where they were ruled guilty by a jury and judge consisting of dwarves, Michaels told Triple H that Hornswoggle could be the mascot. Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped, which Hornswoggle agreed to. On the January 11, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mike Tyson, who was the &quot;Raw&quot; guest host for the night, teamed with Jericho to face DX; however, at the end of the bout, Tyson turned on Jericho and re-aligned himself with Michaels and Triple H. On the February 8, 2010 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX lost the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship to ShoMiz (The Miz and Big Show) in a Triple Threat Elimination Tag Team match also featuring The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). On the March 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, DX lost their rematch for the titles which would be the duo&#x27;s last televised match as a tag team. Due to Michaels&#x27; ongoing obsession with ending the Undertaker&#x27;s WrestleMania streak, Triple H and Michaels quietly separated heading into WrestleMania XXVI, but remained on good terms.

Road Dogg, Billy Gunn and X-Pac have gone under the team names of D-Generates of Wrestling and Team Suck as a tribute to D-Generation X. It while wrestling together on the indy scene before returning to WWE.

On the September 3, 2018 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shawn Michaels made a special appearance to promote the match between Triple H and The Undertaker at Super Show-Down, during which he was confronted by The Undertaker himself. At Super Show-Down, Michaels assisted Triple H in defeating The Undertaker, after which, he was attacked by Undertaker and Kane.

On October 8, Triple H and Shawn Michaels announced that they were officially reforming DX to take on The Brothers of Destruction at Crown Jewel. On the October 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, both Undertaker and Kane declared that they would take the souls of Triple H and Shawn Michaels and stated they would never &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;. This then led to Triple H distracting Kane and Shawn Michaels delivering a Sweet Chin Music to the Undertaker. At Crown Jewel, the Brothers of Destruction dominated DX for most of the match, however, DX were eventually able to pick up the win despite Triple H tearing his pec.

=== Non-wrestling reunions (2010–present) ===

Shawn Michaels and Triple H reunited in a non-wrestling capacity for the 2010 &quot;Tribute to the Troops&quot;, after &quot;SmackDown&quot; events in 2011 and 2012 and during the 2012 Hall of Fame ceremony when they inducted Mike Tyson. On July 23, 2012, at the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, X-Pac, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H simultaneously appeared together for only the second time with all five male members present. Since then, DX reunited on several occasions, like at &quot;Raw 25&quot;, at &quot;Raw Reunion&quot;, on the October 10, 2022 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in the celebration of the group&#x27;s 25th anniversary, or at Raw is XXX.

Also, during Triple H&#x27;s heel Authority storyline in 2013, the New Age Outlaws allied with The Authority and won the WWE Tag Team Championship against the Rhodes Brothers (Cody Rhodes and Goldust), and teamed with Kane to wrestle The Shield at WrestleMania XXX. The last of these appearances, during Triple H&#x27;s match against Sting at WrestleMania 31, was also the first legitimate major confrontation between DX and the nWo.

=== Independent circuit (2015–2016) ===
In December 2015, Billy Gunn and X-Pac reformed DX, in an event for Big Time Wrestling, where they defeated Bam Shaw and &quot;The Punisher&quot; Don Vega. They returned as D-Generation X during the MCW event, &quot;Spring Fever In Maryland&quot; on April 23, along with Lio Rush and Brandon Scott. They competed for Empire State Wrestling on May 21, and for Elite Pro Wrestling, where they faced the New Age Kliq on July 22.

On September 4, 2016, Gunn and X-Pac represented DX in a tag team gauntlet match at a Chikara event. The two entered the match as the final team and scored the win over Prakash Sabar and The Proletariat Boar of Moldova.

== Signature taunts ==

=== Crotch chop ===
D-X promos always include a signature gesture whereby the wrestler points his hands towards his own crotch, making the shape of a &quot;V&quot;, and in the later, more popular variant with hands crossed, an &quot;X&quot;. The implication is that the viewer or listener should &quot;suck it&quot;.

The crotch chop was first used in the WWF by Sean Waltman as 1-2-3 Kid during an In Your House match against Razor Ramon. After knocking Ramon down, he seems to do the gesture almost unintentionally, but perhaps took the risk knowing it was a PPV event and thus not subject to normal censoring restrictions. 
Either way, the move went back to obscurity, until Shawn Michaels revived the taunt several months before the formation of D-X, at least as early as July 21, 1997, while he stood in-ring for an interview segment on &quot;Raw Is War&quot; filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Although Michaels had not yet made his heel turn (which would follow a few weeks later, after the events of SummerSlam), his feud with the Canadian-born Bret Hart made Michaels a de facto heel to the Canadian crowd. Months later, at the October 6, 1997 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, both Michaels and Triple H repeatedly directed the crotch chop at both Hart and hostile members of the audience.

According to Triple H, Vince McMahon was hesitant to let D-X members perform the &quot;X&quot; at first, but he was later talked into it. When D-X enters the ring they do a pyro routine. Green X pyrotechnics go off three times, with D-X crotch-chopping at each firing. They then pause for a second, then chop once more as the pyrotechnics fire for the fourth time.

The crotch chop is used in the 2008 film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; by Jamal (Dev Patel) after getting away from pursuing security guards and by a character in the opening scenes of the 2007 movie &quot;Knocked Up&quot;. Fidel Edwards, the West Indian fast bowler has on occasions used the crotch chop after taking a wicket. It has also been used by Professional Bowler Pete Weber after getting a strike, Weber himself is a fan of wrestling. The character Kenny Powers, in the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;, also uses the gesture in a fantasy sequence where he walks through the halls of the school where he works. In a 2010 episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, titled &quot;Extra Large Medium&quot;, a cutaway shows Spock doing the crotch chop after he wins the lottery. In the 2012 film, &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;, Becca does the crotch chop at the end of the Barden Bellas&#x27; rap in the riff off. It&#x27;s also featured in Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario strikers in a taunt that Waluigi does after scoring a goal. Jon Jones performed the &quot;X&quot; crotch chop after defeating Daniel Cormier at UFC 197. The most recent use of the group&#x27;s crotch chop that occurred on October 29, 2023, when Philadelphia 76ers player Joel Embiid performed that gesture as he and his team played the Portland Trail Blazers in the late third quarter. He was fined $35,000 by the National Basketball Association but Triple H, the current Chief Content Officer, was impressed with the gesture, has invited Embiid for a special role at WrestleMania XL in Philadelphia although the Sixers are playing the Memphis Grizzlies and the San Antonio Spurs during the same weekend.

The crotch chop appeared in an NBA game for a second time on Friday, April 26, 2024, during Game 3 of the Western Conference playoffs first round series between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns. Minnesota&#x27;s Anthony Edwards was doing the taunt repeatedly, not directed at an opposing player, but rather at Rudy Gobert, his own teammate. Edwards later stated in an interview alongside Gobert, &quot;I was trying to get Rudy to do it with me but he would never make eye contact with me, which was crazy because I threw you the ball for the and one.&quot;

Teams in the Australian National Rugby League competition have also used the crotch chop to taunt opponents.

=== &quot;Suck it!&quot; and catchphrases/slogans ===

The crotch chop and the words &quot;suck it&quot; actually originated with the nWo. While Syxx/X-Pac was still a member of the faction, he along with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash would regularly perform the gesture. Later on, D-X would use a cross armed x-chop. The signature D-X slogan originated on the October 6, 1997 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, with Shawn Michaels stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve got two words for &#x27;The Hitman&#x27; Bret Hart: suck it!&quot;, before doing a one-armed crotch-chop (while holding the microphone with his other hand). Later in the episode, both Michaels and Triple H (separately) proceeded to the ring for the Bret Hart-Triple H match, each of them directing the slogan and crotch-chops at fans seated along the entry ramp, as well as the viewers watching at home.
&quot;Oh you didn&#x27;t know? Your ass better call somebody.&quot;

The slogan is also used in the D-X Army&#x27;s popular &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to suck it!&quot; promos, conceived as a parody of Michael Buffer&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s get ready to rumble!&quot; match introduction that was routinely featured at televised WCW events. The routine originated in the &quot;D-X Army&quot; era with X-Pac, Road Dogg, and Billy Gunn and starts when Triple H asks the audience, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;. He then shouts, &quot;No, [city name], I said, are you ready?!&quot;, or &quot;I thought this was [city name], I said, are you ready?!&quot;, to elicit a louder reaction from the crowd. He would continue on, in a similar cadence and voice to Buffer, &quot;Then, for the thousands in attendance, and to the millions watching at home: let&#x27;s get ready to suck it!&quot;. Following this, Road Dogg would announce a variation of &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages: D-Generation X proudly brings to you its WWF Tag Team Champions of the World! The Road Dogg Jesse James, The Bad Ass Billy Gunn: The New Age Outlaws!&quot; In which, the variation is, they would call themselves the &quot;soon-to-be WWF Tag Team Champions of the world&quot; only if they weren&#x27;t holding the championship at the time. The group would then talk or posture in relation to the people they were feuding with at the time. Billy Gunn would then end the routine with &quot;And if you&#x27;re not down with that, we got two words for ya!&quot; to which the crowd shouts &quot;suck it!&quot; back at them.

During the tag team revival of the group in later years, the routine was truncated so that Triple H would say his part while Michaels would take Billy Gunn&#x27;s lines to conclude it. They often would just say these two parts, with brief ad libbing, rather than lengthy speeches each time.

<text>David Millar (born 4 January 1977) is a Scottish retired professional road racing cyclist. He rode for Cofidis from 1997 to 2004 and Garmin–Sharp from 2008 to 2014. He has won four stages of the Tour de France, five of the Vuelta a España and one stage of the Giro d&#x27;Italia. He was the British national road champion and the national time trial champion, both in 2007.

Millar was banned for two years in 2004 after he admitted to taking banned performance-enhancing drugs. Upon his return from his ban, Millar became an anti-doping campaigner, a stance which eventually resulted in journalist Alasdair Fotheringham describing him as an &#x27;&#x27; of cycling.

==Early life and education==
Millar is the son of Gordon and Avril Millar, both Scots. His father was a pilot in the Royal Air Force and Millar was born in Mtarfa, Malta, while his father was based there for a three-year tour of duty. His mother worked as a teacher. He has a sister, Frances (Fran) who also works in cycling, currently as the chief executive officer of Team Ineos. The family returned to the United Kingdom, and lived at RAF Kinloss in Scotland before moving to Aylesbury, 60 km north-west of London. His father and mother divorced when Millar was 11 and his father moved to Hong Kong, when he joined the airline Cathay Pacific, which is based there. Millar considers Hong Kong as his home. Millar moved to Hong Kong to join his father when he was 13. He rode in BMX bike races in Hong Kong &quot;and did pretty well.&quot; He bought a road bike in 1992 and raced at 6.30 in the morning before the roads began filling with traffic.

At King George V School he chose mathematics, economics and geography as his A-level, pre-university, examination subjects, then switched to art, graphics and sports studies at his father&#x27;s suggestion. He completed his A-levels and, having moved back to England to be with his mother in Maidenhead, enrolled at an arts college. He started cycling with a club in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. His mother, Avril, took him there so that he would make new friends and have something to do. At age 18, a week before he was due to start at the arts college, he went to race in France. He joined a club at St-Quentin, in the Picardy region, and won eight races. Five professional teams offered him a contract. He signed with Cyrille Guimard because his team, Cofidis, was based in the area and he knew of Guimard&#x27;s skill in recognising young talent.

==Early career==

===2000–2003: early years===
In his first professional season, Millar won the prologue of the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir and the competition for the best young rider in the Mi-Août Breton. He profited from his background in 10-mile time-trials in Britain to win the first stage of the 2000 Tour de France, a 16 km time-trial at Futuroscope. He held the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for a few days. He failed to repeat his feat at Dunkirk in 2001 after puncturing in a bend and crashing. He finished fifth in the prologue in 2002 on a rolling course at Luxembourg. His attempt to win the prologue in central Paris in the centenary Tour of 2003 ended when his chain dropped off 500 m before the finish. He lost by 0.14 s to Brad McGee. Millar had ridden a bike without a front derailleur to save weight. He blamed his directeur sportif, Alain Bondue. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a problem with my chainring; it was a problem with my team&quot;, he told journalists at the finish. He said Bondue had tried to save a few grams by removing the derailleur. Bondue said he had told Millar to use a front derailleur after other riders had similar problems. Bondue was demoted to logistics manager.

Hopes of winning the Tour de France were fuelled by his stage win in the 2001 Vuelta a España, when he was in a breakaway with Santiago Botero on a mountain stage. Millar won a gold medal for Malta in the 2001 Games of the Small States of Europe, held in San Marino. Millar was selected for the Scotland team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but withdrew to compete for Cofidis instead.

In the 2002 Vuelta a España, stage 15 included the ascent of the Alto de l&#x27;Angliru in rain. Team cars stalled on the steepest part, some unable to restart because their tires slipped on messages painted by fans. Riders were caught behind them and others had to ride with flat tires because mechanics could not reach them. Millar crashed three times, and protested by handing in his race number a metre from the line, effectively abandoning from the race. The judges ruled he had not finished the stage and he was not reinstated, having already left for his home in Biarritz. He regretted his temper—he had been ninth—and later apologised to his team.

==Doping==
Millar was dining in a restaurant with Dave Brailsford in Bidart, near Biarritz, on 23 June 2004 when he was approached by three plainclothes policemen of the Paris drug squad at 8.25pm. They detained Millar and took his watch, shoelaces, jewellery, keys and phone. After searching his home for two and a half hours they found empty phials of Eprex, a brand of the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin (EPO), and two used syringes. Millar claimed he had been given them as a gift at the Tour of Spain, and that he had taken them to Manchester and used them there. After that he had kept them as a souvenir. The detectives took Millar into custody.

The raid followed the arrest at the start of 2004 of Bogdan Madejak, a Cofidis soigneur. Police, looking to find out more about the drugs found on Madejak, turned their attention to another rider on the team, Philippe Gaumont, as he arrived at Orly airport on 20 January 2004. On 22 January 2004 the magazine, &quot;Le Point&quot;, published transcripts of police phone taps.

Gaumont said he had given Millar the drugs and syringes the day before the Tour finished on the Champs-Élysées in 2003, when Millar won the time-trial. Gaumont said he didn&#x27;t know what was in the syringe but that &quot;&quot;ça m&#x27;avait bloqué&quot; (that blocked me; i.e. kept me from going well).&quot; Millar denied the claim to the investigating judge, and said that team doctor Menuet was the best person he had ever met and that he was &quot;like a father to me at races.&quot; He denied Gaumont&#x27;s claims that Millar had taken drugs by mixing Stilnox, a sleeping powder, with ephedrine, a stimulant. He called Gaumont a lunatic and said he was talking &quot;absolute crap.&quot; But Millar&#x27;s phone calls had been tapped for four months and Millar eventually confessed to police on 24 June 2004.

Millar admitted using EPO in 2001 and 2003. He blamed it on stress, in particular losing the prologue in the 2003 Tour and being beaten by Jan Ullrich in the 2001 world time trial championship. Under cycling rules a confession equates to a positive test.

British Cycling suspended him for two years in August 2004. He was disqualified as 2003 world time trial champion, fined CHF2,000 (approx. €1250), and disqualified from the 2003 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and 2001 Vuelta a España. Cofidis fired Millar and withdrew from racing while it carried out an internal investigation. Several Cofidis riders and assistants were fired. Alain Bondue, the team&#x27;s director, and Menuet, the doctor, left the team. Vasseur was forbidden to start the 2004 Tour de France but later cleared.

Millar failed in an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to reduce his ban, but the court did backdate his suspension to the day he confessed, 24 June 2004.

Millar was prosecuted in a French court in Nanterre in 2006 with nine other defendants, mostly from Cofidis. The court decided it was not clear he had taken drugs in France and that charges could not be pursued. The doctor he had consulted lived in Spain, south of Biarritz and across the Pyrenees. Millar&#x27;s statement to the judge stated that he had succumbed to the pressure of racing, the expectations placed on him by British fans, and an inability to make close friends. Winning the prologue of the Tour de France made things worse; he had worn the &quot;maillot jaune&quot; of leadership – his &quot;dream&quot;, he said – and when it was all over he was back in his apartment with no friends and just a television for company.

Millar has claimed that doping gained him 25 seconds in the 2003 world time-trial championship. He toasted his championship in the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas. But the suspension cost Millar his job, his income and his house. Millar then began abusing alcohol for much of a year. He said he had scraped by with the help of family and friends.

==Later career==

===2005–2007: post-suspension===

Millar moved to Hayfield, on the edge of the Peak District of northern England, to be close to the Manchester Velodrome where British cycling has its headquarters. He joined a Spanish team, . Its manager, Mauro Gianetti, had contacted him nine months into his suspension.

Millar&#x27;s suspension ended a week before the 2006 Tour de France and he rode with . He finished 17th in the prologue and 11th on the penultimate, time-trial stage. He finished 59th of 139 finishers, more than 2 hours behind the winner, Óscar Pereiro. In the 2006 Vuelta a España, Millar won in stage 14, a time trial around the city of Cuenca. On 3 October, he won the British 4,000m individual pursuit championship in 4m 22.32s at Manchester.

He left to join an American team, run by Jonathan Vaughters, a former rider. Vaughters stressed the team&#x27;s stance against doping. In the 2007 season, Millar won both the British road and time trial championships and came second in the Eneco Tour, 11 seconds behind José Iván Gutiérrez. His other victory of the year came in the Paris–Nice, during which he won the prologue.

===2008–2014: career with Garmin===

For the start of the 2008 season, Slipstream became known as Garmin Slipstream, and Millar took on part ownership of the team, in order to foster their anti-doping stance. He helped orchestrate &#x27;s victory in the Giro d&#x27;Italia opening team time trial. Millar was part of a five-man winning break on stage five of the 2008 Giro d&#x27;Italia when his chain broke in the last kilometre and he flung his bike to the roadside.

In the 2008 Tour de France, Millar came third in the time trial on stage four, 18 seconds behind the winner. Overall he finished 68th, 1h 59m 39s behind Carlos Sastre. His best results of the season came in the 2008 Tour of California in which he finished second overall.

Millar rode the 2009 Giro d&#x27;Italia and then the 2009 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, finishing ninth overall. He competed in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. His best performance in a stage was winning the stage 20 time trial at the Vuelta. The race was Millar&#x27;s first win for two years, and his fifth at the Vuelta.
2010 saw Millar continue his strong time-trial form, with stage wins at the Critérium International and the Three Days of De Panne. De Panne also saw Millar gain his first multi-stage race victory since the 2001 Circuit de la Sarthe. Millar had a number of high placings in major time trials earlier in the season – he finished third in the prologue of the 2010 Tour de France and second in stage three of the Critérium du Dauphiné. An injury in the Tour de France hampered the rest of his season, though he finished all three grand tours. Millar then matched his best clean placing at the Men&#x27;s World Time-Trial Championships, finishing second behind Fabian Cancellara. Shortly after, at the Commonwealth Games, he won a gold medal in the time trial and a bronze in the road race.

2011 saw Millar suffer from illness early in the season, missing many of the classics. His best performance was a 3rd-place finish in the overall of the Circuit de la Sarthe. He recovered in time for the Giro d&#x27;Italia, finishing second on stage 3 to take the pink jersey as leader of the general classification. Millar&#x27;s lead, however, was overshadowed by the death of Wouter Weylandt in the Giro on the same day; in the role of race leader, Millar helped organise the tributes to Weylandt&#x27;s during the subsequent day&#x27;s neutralised stage.

He later won the time-trial stage 21 of the Giro, meaning that he became only the third British rider – after Robert Millar and Mark Cavendish – to achieve victories in all three Grand Tours during his career. In June he published his autobiography titled &quot;Racing Through the Dark&quot;, which Richard Williams in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote was &quot;one of the great first-person accounts of sporting experience&quot;. Millar was team captain of the Great Britain team that helped Cavendish win the 2011 UCI World Championships road race.
Millar fractured his collarbone in a crash in the 2012 E3 Harelbeke one-day race in Belgium on 23 March. He returned to competition at the Tour of Bavaria and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where his best result was a 9th place on stage 4. Despite his injuries earlier in the season, Millar was selected to ride his 11th Tour de France. He won stage 12 by escaping with four other riders, arriving from the finish line in Annonay–Davézieux with more than ten minutes of an advantage over the bunch. He took the win after much cat-and-mouse-play with Jean-Christophe Péraud of . He was the fourth British rider to win a stage in a tour, as Bradley Wiggins became the second British rider to win the event (Nicole Cooke won the women&#x27;s Tour in 2006). Millar was selected to race on the British Road Race Team for the London Olympics. He reprised his role of team captain from the 2011 World Championships, again aiming to steer Mark Cavendish to victory. Millar and GB teammates Bradley Wiggins, Ian Stannard and Chris Froome were forced to set the tempo for the majority of the race, with little help from the other nations, and were eventually unable to reel back a thirty-man breakaway that had gone clear on the final climb of the Box Hill circuit, leaving Cavendish to come in forty seconds behind the winner, Alexander Vinokourov.

Millar was not selected to make the 2014 Tour de France team, a decision that left him &#x27;devastated and shocked&#x27;. Millar retired from professional cycling after the 2014 season with his last competitive start being at the Bec CC Hill Climb in October. The final year of Millar&#x27;s career was captured by documentary maker Finlay Pretsell for the film &quot;Time Trial&quot;. Intended as an insight into the world of professional cycling, the film took on themes of aging and retirement as it traced Millar&#x27;s growing realisation that he was unable to perform at his previous levels. &quot;Time Trial&quot; was released to cinemas in the UK on 29 June 2018.

===Post-racing career===
In March 2015 Millar revealed he was coaching former teammate Ryder Hesjedal, and he has taken a mentoring role with the Great Britain under-23 cycling squad. He represented the professional cyclists&#x27; body Cyclistes Professionnels Associes (CPA) on the UCI&#x27;s working group to establish an Extreme Weather Protocol to provide clear guidance on procedures in the event of severe weather affecting a race; the protocol was first used at the 2016 Paris–Nice. In 2018, he announced that he would challenge incumbent CPA president Gianni Bugno for the leadership of the organisation, running on a manifesto which advocated democratic reforms to the union&#x27;s voting system, a financial audit of its finances, and improving communication with riders. This was the first contested election in the CPA&#x27;s history: Millar was defeated by Bugno, winning 96 votes to the latter&#x27;s 379.

Millar launched his &#x27;Chpt3&#x27; brand in 2015, collaborating with various partners to produce a range of cycling-related products, including bikes and clothing. He works as a cycling journalist and pundit, and since 2016 has been the co-commentator on ITV&#x27;s coverage of the Tour de France and Vuelta a España. Millar also co-hosts Never Strays Far, a &quot;cycling-adjacent&quot; podcast, with fellow ITV commentator Ned Boulting and former pro Peter Kennaugh.

==Personal life==
On 9 September 2011, Millar&#x27;s wife, Nicole, gave birth to their son, Archibald Millar, their second son, Harvey Millar, was born on 2 May 2013. Their daughter Maxine Millar was born on 31 December 2015.

In 2013, while giving consultation to the production of the film &quot;The Program&quot;, Millar hit his head on a low-hanging beam while walking through a hotel. The accident left him without a sense of smell.

Millar&#x27;s sister, Fran, was appointed CEO of the cycling team Team Ineos in June 2019.

He is not related to Robert Millar, now living as Philippa York, a fellow road cyclist from the west of Scotland whose main success came in the mid-1980s.

<text>Bulee &quot;Slim&quot; Gaillard (January 9, 1911 – February 26, 1991), also known as McVouty, was an American jazz singer and songwriter who played piano, guitar, vibraphone, and tenor saxophone. Gaillard was noted for his comedic vocalese singing and word play in his own constructed language called &quot;Vout-o-Reenee&quot;, for which he wrote a dictionary.

In addition to English, he spoke five languages (Spanish, German, Greek, Arabic, and Armenian) with varying degrees of fluency.

He rose to prominence in the late 1930s with hits such as &quot;Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)&quot; and &quot;Cement Mixer (Put-Ti-Put-Ti)&quot; after forming Slim and Slam with Leroy Eliot &quot;Slam&quot; Stewart. During World War II, Gaillard served in the US Army Air Forces. In 1944, he resumed his music career and performed with such notable jazz musicians as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Dodo Marmarosa.

In the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, he acted in films—sometimes as himself—and also appeared in bit parts in television series such as &quot;&quot;. Gaillard resumed touring the circuit of European jazz festivals during the 1980s.

==Early life==
Along with Gaillard&#x27;s birthdate, his lineage and place of birth are disputed. Many sources state that he was born in Detroit, Michigan, though Gaillard said himself that he was born in Santa Clara, Cuba, of an Afro-Cuban mother called Maria (Mary Gaillard) and a German-Jewish father called Theophilus (Theophilus Rothschild) who worked as a ship&#x27;s steward.

During an interview in 1989, Gaillard added: &quot;They all think I was born in Detroit because that was the first place I got into when I got to America.&quot; However, the 1920 census lists one &quot;Beuler Gillard&quot; as living in Pensacola, Florida, having been born in April 1918 in Alabama. Bulee Gaillard&#x27;s Draft Registration card dated October 14, 1940, and signed by Gaillard, lists his birth date as &quot;Jan 4 1911&quot; in &quot;Pensacola Florida.&quot; His World War II Army Enlistment Record also lists his birth year as 1911. Researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc have concluded that he was probably born in June 1918 in Claiborne, Alabama, where a &quot;Theophilus Rothchild&quot; had been raised the son of a successful merchant in the small town of Burnt Corn; other documents give his name as Wilson, Bulee, or Beuler Gillard or Gaillard.

At age 12, he accompanied his father on a world voyage and was accidentally left behind on the island of Crete. On a television documentary in 1989, he said, &quot;When I was stranded in Crete, I was only 12 years old. I stayed there for four years. I traveled on the boats to Beirut and Syria and I learned to speak the language and the people&#x27;s way of life.&quot; After learning a few words of Greek, he worked on the island &quot;making shoes and hats&quot;. He then joined a ship working the eastern Mediterranean ports, mainly Beirut, where he picked up some knowledge of Arabic.

When Gaillard was about 15, he re-crossed the Atlantic, hoping the ship would take him home to Cuba, but it was bound for the U.S. and he ended up in Detroit. He never saw either of his parents again. Alone and unable to speak English, he tried to get a job at Ford Motor Company but was rejected because of his age. Gaillard worked at a general store owned by an Armenian family, with whom he lived for some time, then tried to become a boxer. During Prohibition in 1931 or 1932, he drove a hearse with a coffin that was packed with whiskey for the Purple Gang.

He attended evening classes in music and taught himself to play guitar and piano. When Duke Ellington came to Detroit, Gaillard went backstage and met his hero. Determined to become a musical entertainer, he moved to New York City and entered the world of show business as a &quot;professional amateur&quot;. As Gaillard recalled much later: &quot;The MC would say, &quot;Here they come, all the hopefuls!&quot; Well, we may have been hopefuls but we weren&#x27;t amateurs. Of course, you had to be a little bad in spots. If you were too good you&#x27;d lose the amateur image. I would be a tap dancer this week, next week I&#x27;d play guitar, two weeks later some boogie-woogie piano. They paid us $16 a show. I did one with Frank Sinatra, I got $16 and he got $16. Every time I see him I say, &quot;Got a raise yet, Frank?&quot;

==Career==

Gaillard first rose to prominence in the late 1930s as part of Slim &amp; Slam, a jazz novelty act he formed with bassist Slam Stewart. Their hits included &quot;Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)&quot; and &quot;Cement Mixer (Put-Ti-Put-Ti)&quot;. The duo performs in the 1941 movie &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;.

Gaillard&#x27;s appeal was similar to Cab Calloway&#x27;s and Louis Jordan&#x27;s in that he presented a hip style with broad appeal (e.g. in his children&#x27;s song &quot;Down by the Station&quot;). Unlike Calloway and Jordan, however, he was a master improviser whose stream of consciousness vocals ranged far from the original lyrics. He sang wild interpolations of nonsense syllables, such as &quot;MacVoutie O-Reeney&quot;. One such performance is celebrated in the 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac. Gaillard, with Dodo Marmarosa on piano, appeared as a guest several times on &quot;Command Performance&quot;, recorded at KNX radio studios in Hollywood in the 1940s and distributed on transcription discs to American troops during World War II.

In December 1942, Gaillard was drafted into the United States Army Air Forces. There, Corporal Gaillard was an assistant crew chief working on B-26 “Marauder bombers” at Laughlin Field, Del Rio, Texas.
 He was discharged before the end of the war after a year and seven months of service, six months after being diagnosed with chronic frontal sinusitis.
He resumed his music career on his release from the draft in 1944. Upon his return he released the song &quot;Atomic Cocktail&quot;, which featured seemingly lighthearted lyrics laced with symbolism about nuclear war.

Gaillard later teamed with bassist Bam Brown, and their successes included the hipster anthem &quot;Opera in Vout (Groove Juice Symphony)&quot;. They can be seen in &quot;O&#x27;Voutie O&#x27;Rooney&quot;, a 1947 motion picture featurette filmed live at one of their nightclub performances. Slim and Bam were featured at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on September 23, 1945, along with Count Basie. Gaillard also played for the 2nd Cavalcade of Jazz at Wrigley Field on October 12, 1946, and for the 3rd Cavalcade of Jazz, also at Wrigley Field on September 7, 1947.


In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Gaillard frequently opened at Birdland for Charlie Parker, Flip Phillips, and Coleman Hawkins. His December 1945 session with Parker and Dizzy Gillespie is notable, both musically and for its relaxed convivial air. &quot;Slim&#x27;s Jam&quot;, from that session, is one of the earliest known recordings of Parker&#x27;s speaking voice. In 1949, Gaillard was playing in San Francisco. An account of meeting Gaillard at a performance there can be found near the end of Part Two of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.

Gaillard could play several instruments and manage to turn the performance from jazz to comedy. He would play guitar with his left hand fretting with fingers pointing down over the fingerboard (instead of the usual way up from under it), or would play credible piano solos with palms facing up.

Gaillard wrote the theme for the Peter Potter radio show. In 1950, he wrote and recorded the &quot;Don Pitts On the Air&quot; theme for San Francisco DJ Don Pitts. On March 27, 2008, the Pitts theme entered the archives of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.

In the early 1960s, Gaillard lived in San Diego, California. During that time, he recorded several singles and performed with local bands. Under the name Slim Delgado, he recorded &quot;Frank Rhoads Round&quot;, a rock-and-roll single for the Xavier label. On the B-side is a song called &quot;Dr. Free&quot;.

Gaillard appeared on several TV shows during the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, including &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, and &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;. He also appeared in the &#x27;70s TV series &quot;&quot; and reprised some of his old hits on the NBC prime-time variety program &quot;The Chuck Barris Rah Rah Show&quot;.

By the early 1980s, Gaillard was touring the European jazz festival circuit, playing with such musicians as Arnett Cobb. He also performed with George Melly and John Chilton&#x27;s Feetwarmers, appearing on their BBC television series and occasionally deputising for Melly when he was unwell. Gaillard&#x27;s onstage behavior was often erratic and nerve-wracking for the accompanying musicians. He made a guest appearance on Show 106 of the 1980s program &quot;Night Music&quot;, an NBC late-night music series hosted by David Sanborn.

Gaillard followed Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s advice to move to Europe and settled in London in 1983. Around Christmas 1985, Gaillard recorded the album &quot;Siboney&quot; at Gateway Studios in Battersea, London, produced by Joe Massot. As Massot recalled later:
 In 1986, Gaillard appeared in the musical film &quot;&quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;&quot;, singing &quot;Selling Out&quot;. In the autumn of 1989, the BBC aired director Anthony Wall&#x27;s four-part documentary on Gaillard entitled &quot;Slim Gaillard&#x27;s Civilisation&quot;.

==Death==

Gaillard died of cancer in London on February 26, 1991. His unique and varied career spanned nearly six decades. Gaillard was survived by a number of children including Janis Hunter Gaye (1956-2022), former wife of singer-songwriter Marvin Gaye.

==Languages used in songs==
* Gaillard used Yiddish in at least two of his songs, &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Bagel&quot; and &quot;Matzo Balls&quot;, where he refers to numerous ethnic dishes typically eaten by Ashkenazi Jews. The songs were issued by the Slim Gaillard Quartet in 1945 on the Melodisc label, featuring Gaillard on guitar, Zutty Singleton on drums, &quot;Tiny&quot; Brown on bass and Dodo Marmarosa on piano. &quot;Dunkin&#x27; Bagel&quot; was later included in the 2010 compilation CD &quot;Black Sabbath: The Secret Musical History of Black-Jewish Relations&quot;, issued by the Idelsohn Society for Musical Preservation.
* Gaillard recorded a Greek folk song, &quot;Tee say malee&quot; (&quot;Why Do You Care&quot;).
* Arabic is used in some of Gaillard&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Yep-Roc-Heresy&quot; and &quot;Arabian Boogie&quot;.
* Irish is present in the name &quot;O&#x27;Voutie O&#x27;Rooney&quot;, the title of his 1947 movie and reminiscent of &quot;Vout-o-Reenee&quot;, Gaillard&#x27;s name for his invented language.

<text>The Tale of Tsar Saltan, of His Son the Renowned and Mighty Bogatyr Prince Gvidon Saltanovich and of the Beautiful Swan-Princess ( ) is an 1831 fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin.

As a folk tale it is classified as Aarne–Thompson type 707, &quot;The Three Golden Children&quot;, for it being a variation of The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird. Similar tales are found across the East Slavic countries and in the Baltic languages.

== Synopsis ==
The story is about three sisters. The youngest is chosen by Tsar Saltan (Saltán) to be his wife. He orders the other two sisters to be his royal cook and weaver. They become jealous of their younger sister. When the tsar goes off to war, the tsaritsa gives birth to a son, Prince Gvidon (Gvidón). The older sisters arrange to have the tsaritsa and the child sealed in a barrel and thrown into the sea.

The sea takes pity on them and casts them on the shore of a remote island, Buyan. The son, having quickly grown while in the barrel, goes hunting. He ends up saving an enchanted swan from a kite bird.

The swan creates a city for Prince Gvidon to rule, which some merchants, on the way to Tsar Saltan&#x27;s court, admire and go to tell Tsar Saltan. Gvidon is homesick, so the swan turns him into a mosquito to help him. In this guise, he visits Tsar Saltan&#x27;s court. In his court, his younger aunt scoffs at the merchant&#x27;s narration about the city in Buyan, and describes a more interesting sight: in an oak lives a squirrel that sings songs and cracks nuts with a golden shell and kernel of emerald. Gvidon, as a mosquito, stings his aunt in the eye and escapes.

Back in his realm, the swan gives Gvidon the magical squirrel. But he continues to pine for home, so the swan transforms him again, this time into a fly. In this guise Prince Gvidon visits Saltan&#x27;s court again and overhears his elder aunt telling the merchants about an army of 33 men led by one Chernomor that march in the sea. Gvidon stings his older aunt in the eye and flies back to Buyan. He informs the swan of the 33 &quot;sea-knights&quot;, and the swan tells him they are her brothers. They march out of the sea, promise to be guards and watchmen of Gvidon&#x27;s city, and vanish.

The third time, the Prince is transformed into a bumblebee and flies to his father&#x27;s court. There, his maternal grandmother tells the merchants about a beautiful princess who outshines both the sun in the morning and the moon at night, with crescent moons in her braids and a star on her brow. Gvidon stings her nose and flies back to Buyan.

Back to Buyan, he sighs over not having a bride. The swan inquires the reason, and Gvidon explains about the beautiful princess his grandmother described. The swan promises to find him the maiden and bids him await until the next day. The next day, the swan reveals &quot;she&quot; is the same princess his grandmother described and turns into a human princess. Gvidon takes her to his mother and introduces her as his bride. His mother gives her blessing to the couple and they are wed.

At the end of the tale, the merchants go to Tsar Saltan&#x27;s court and, impressed by their narration, decides to visit this fabled island kingdom at once, despite protests from his sisters- and mother-in-law. He and the court sail away to Buyan, and are welcomed by Gvidon. The prince guides Saltan to meet his lost Tsaritsa, Gvidon&#x27;s mother, and discovers her family&#x27;s ruse. He is overjoyed to find his newly married son and daughter-in-law.

== Translation ==
The tale was given in prose form by American journalist Post Wheeler, in his book &quot;Russian Wonder Tales&quot; (1917). It was translated in verse by Louis Zellikoff in the book &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; by Progress Publishers, Moscow in 1970, and later reissued in &quot;The Tales of Alexander Pushkin (The Tale of the Golden Cockerel &amp; The Tale of Tsar Saltan)&quot; by Malysh Publishers in 1981.

== Analysis ==
=== Tale type ===
Despite being a versified fairy tale written by Pushkin, the tale can be classified, in the East Slavic Folktale Classification (), as tale type SUS 707, &quot;Чудесные дети&quot; (&quot;The Miraculous Children&quot;). The East Slavic classification corresponds, in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, to tale type ATU 707, &quot;The Three Golden Children&quot;. It is also the default form by which type ATU 707 is known in Russian and Eastern European academia.

=== Motifs ===
==== The &quot;East Slavic&quot; redaction ====
In a late 19th century article, Russian ethnographer Grigory Potanin identified a group of Russian fairy tales with the following characteristics: three sisters boast about grand accomplishments, the youngest about giving birth to wondrous children; the king marries her and makes her his queen; the elder sisters replace their nephews for animals, and the queen is cast in the sea with her son in a barrel; mother and son survive and the son goes after strange and miraculous items; at the end of the tale, the deceit is revealed and the queen&#x27;s sisters are punished.

In a series of articles published in &quot;Revue d&#x27;ethnographie et de sociologie&quot;, French scholar Gédeon Huet identified a subset of variants of the story of &quot;Les soeurs jalouses&quot; which involve the calumniated mother and her son cast in the sea in a barrel. He termed this group &quot;the Slavic version&quot; and suggested that this format &quot;penetrated into Siberia&quot;, brought by Russian migrants.

Folklore scholar Christine Goldberg identifies three main forms of this tale type: a variation found &quot;throughout Europe&quot;, with the quest for three magical items (as shown in &quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird&quot;); &quot;an East Slavic form&quot;, where mother and son are cast in a barrel and later the sons build a palace; and a third one, where the sons are buried and go through a transformation sequence, from trees to animals to humans again.

According to Russian scholar T. V. Zueva, in the &quot;main East Slavic version&quot; of &quot;The Miraculous Children&quot;, the third sister goes through a pregnancy of multiple babies; later, she is cast in the sea with one of her sons, and they take refuge on an isle of wonders in the middle of the sea.

==== Rescue of brothers by use of mother&#x27;s milk ====
French comparativist Emmanuel Cosquin, in a 1922 article, noted that in some Belarusian variants of &quot;Les soeurs jalouses&quot; (&quot;The Jealous Sisters&quot;), the third sister&#x27;s remaining son finds his missing brothers and uses their mother&#x27;s milk to confirm their brotherly connection. Likewise, according to Russian folklorist , a &quot;frequent&quot; episode of East Slavic variants of tale type 707 is the protagonist bringing his brothers some cakes made with their mother&#x27;s milk. Russian professor Khemlet Tatiana Yurievna describes that this is the version of the tale type in East Slavic, Scandinavian and Baltic variants, although Russian folklorist claimed that this motif is &quot;characteristic&quot; of East Slavic folklore, not necessarily related to variants of tale type 707.

In other variants, the hero&#x27;s missing elder brothers have been cursed to animal shape, but they can be saved by tasting their mother&#x27;s milk. Russian scholar T. V. Zueva argues that the use of &quot;mother&#x27;s milk&quot; or &quot;breast milk&quot; as the key to the reversal of the transformation can be explained by the ancient belief that it has curse-breaking properties. Likewise, scholarship points to an old belief connecting breastmilk and &quot;natal blood&quot;, as observed in the works of Aristotle and Galen. Thus, the use of mother&#x27;s milk serves to reinforce the hero&#x27;s blood relation with his brothers.

==== Other motifs ====
Russian tale collections attest to the presence of Baba Yaga, the witch of Slavic folklore, as the antagonist in many of the stories.

Russian scholar T. V. Zueva suggests that this format must have developed during the period of the Kievan Rus, a period where an intense fluvial trade network developed, since this &quot;East Slavic format&quot; emphasizes the presence of foreign merchants and traders. She also argues for the presence of the strange island full of marvels as another element.

Folklorist Lev Barag noted that, in the East Slavic tales, the antagonists describe the wondrous sights the hero will search for: children with miraculous traits, a , a pig with golden bristles, a strange bull, a magic mill, among other objects.

=== Mythological parallels ===
This &quot;Slavic&quot; narrative (mother and child or children cast into a chest) recalls the motif of &quot;The Floating Chest&quot;, which appears in narratives of Greek mythology about the legendary birth of heroes and gods. The motif also appears in the Breton legend of saint Budoc and his mother Azénor: Azénor was still pregnant when cast into the sea in a box by her husband, but an angel led her to safety and she gave birth to future Breton saint Budoc.

===Central Asian parallels===
Following professor Marat Nurmukhamedov&#x27;s (ru) study on Pushkin&#x27;s verse fairy tale, professor Karl Reichl (ky) argues that the &quot;dastan&quot; (a type of Central Asian oral epic poetry) titled &quot;Šaryar&quot;, from the Turkic Karakalpaks, is &quot;closely related&quot; to the tale type of the Calumniated Wife, and more specifically to &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;.

==Variants==
===Distribution===
Russian folklorist attributed the diffusion of this format amongst the East Slavs to the popularity of Pushkin&#x27;s versified tale. Similarly, Andreas Johns recognizes that, while being possibly inspired by oral variants, Pushkin&#x27;s work has left its influence on tales later collected from oral tradition. In the same vein, Ukrainian folklorist noted that, despite the Tale of Tsar Saltan being a &quot;reflex&quot; of the folktale, it &quot;significantly&quot; influenced the East Slavic folktale corpus.

Professor Jack Haney stated that the tale type registers 78 variants in Russia and 30 tales in Belarus.

In Ukraine, a previous analysis by professor Nikolai Andrejev noted an amount between 11 and 15 variants of type &quot;The Marvelous Children&quot;. A later analysis by Haney gave 23 variants registered.

===Predecessors===
The earliest version of tale type 707 in Russia was recorded in &quot;Старая погудка на новый лад&quot; (1794–1795), with the name &quot;Сказка о Катерине Сатериме&quot; (&quot;Skazka o Katyerinye Satyerimye&quot;; &quot;The Tale of Katarina Saterima&quot;). In this tale, Katerina Saterima is the youngest princess, and promises to marry the Tsar of Burzhat and bear him two sons, their arms of gold to the elbow, their legs of silver to the knee, and pearls in their hair. The princess and her two sons are put in a barrel and thrown in the sea.

The same work collected a second variant: &quot;Сказка о Труде-королевне&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Princess Trude&quot;), where the king and queen consult with a seer and learn of the prophecy that their daughter will give birth to the wonder-children: she is to give birth to nine sons in three gestations, and each of them shall have arms of gold up to the elbow, legs of silver up to the knee, pearls in their hair, a shining moon on the front and a red sun on the back of the neck. This prediction catches the interest of a neighboring king, who wishes to marry the princess and father the wonder-children.

Another compilation in the Russian language that precedes both &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot; and Afanasyev&#x27;s tale collection was &quot;Сказки моего дедушки&quot; (1820), which recorded a variant titled &quot;Сказка о говорящей птице, поющем дереве и золо[то]-желтой воде&quot; (&quot;Skazka o govoryashchyey ptitse, poyushchyem dyeryevye i zolo[to]-zhyeltoy vodye&quot;).

Early-20th century Russian scholarship also pointed that Arina Rodionovna, Pushkin&#x27;s nanny, may have been one of the sources of inspiration to his versified fairy tale &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;. Rodionovna&#x27;s version, heard in 1824, contains the three sisters; the youngest&#x27;s promise to bear 33 children, and a 34th born &quot;of a miracle&quot; - all with silver legs up to the knee, golden arms up to the elbows, a star on the front, a moon on the back; the mother and sons cast in the water; the quest for the strange sights the sisters mention to the king in court. Rodionovna named the prince &quot;Sultan Sultanovich&quot;, which may hint at a foreign origin for her tale.

===East Slavic languages===
====Russia====
Russian folklorist Alexander Afanasyev collected seven variants, divided in two types: &quot;The Children with Calves of Gold and Forearms of Silver&quot; (in a more direct translation: &quot;Up to the Knee in Gold, Up to the Elbow in Silver&quot;), and &quot;The Singing Tree and The Speaking Bird&quot;. Two of his tales have been translated into English: &quot;The Singing-Tree and the Speaking-Bird&quot; and &quot;The Wicked Sisters&quot;. In the later, the children are male triplets with astral motifs on their bodies, but there is no quest for the wondrous items.

Another Russian variant follows the format of &quot;The Brother Quests for a Bride&quot;. In this story, collected by Russian folklorist with the title &quot;Иванъ Царевичъ и Марья Жолтый Цвѣтъ&quot; or &quot;Ivan Tsarevich and Maria the Yellow Flower&quot;, the tsaritsa is expelled from the imperial palace, after being accused of giving birth to puppies. In reality, her twin children (a boy and a girl) were cast in the sea in a barrel and found by a hermit. When they reach adulthood, their aunts send the brother on a quest for the lady Maria, the Yellow Flower, who acts as the speaking bird and reveals the truth during a banquet with the tsar.

One variant of the tale type has been collected in &quot;Priangarya&quot; (Irkutsk Oblast), in East Siberia.

In a tale collected in Western Dvina (Daugava), &quot;Каровушка-Бялонюшка&quot;, the stepdaughter promises to give birth to &quot;three times three children&quot;, all with arms of gold, legs of silver and stars on their heads. Later in the story, her stepmother dismisses her stepdaughter&#x27;s claims to the tsar, by telling him of strange and wondrous things in a distant kingdom. This tale was also connected to Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;, along with other variants from Northwestern Russia.

Russian ethnographer Grigory Potanin gave the summary of variant collected by Romanov about a &quot;Сын Хоробор&quot; (&quot;Son Horobor&quot;): a king has three daughters, the other has an only son, who wants to marry the youngest sister. The other two try to impress him by flaunting their abilities in weaving (sewing 30 shirts with only one &quot;kuzhalinka&quot;, a fiber) and cooking (making 30 pies with only a bit of wheat), but he insists on marrying the third one, who promises to bear him 30 sons and a son named &quot;Horobor&quot;, all with a star on the front, the moon on the back, with golden up to the waist and silver up to knees. The sisters replace the 30 sons for animals, exchange the prince&#x27;s letters and write a false order for the queen and Horobor to be cast into the sea in a barrel. Horobor (or Khyrobor) prays to god for the barrel to reach safe land. He and his mother build a palace on the island, which is visited by merchants. Horobor gives the merchants a cat that serves as his spy on the sisters&#x27; extraordinary claims.

Another version given by Potanin was collected in Biysk by Adrianov: a king listens to the conversations of three sisters, and marries the youngest, who promises to give birth to three golden-handed boys. However, a woman named Yagishna replaces the boys for a cat, a dog and a &quot;korosta&quot;. The queen and the three animals are thrown in the sea in a barrel. The cat, the dog and the korosta spy on Yagishna telling about the three golden-handed boys hidden in a well and rescue them.

In a Siberian tale collected by A. A. Makarenko in Kazachinskaya Volost, &quot;О царевне и её трех сыновьях&quot; (&quot;The Tsarevna and her three children&quot;), two girls – a peasant&#x27;s daughter and Baba Yaga&#x27;s daughter – talk about what they would do to marry the king. The girl promises to give birth to three sons: one with legs of silver, the second with legs of gold, and the third with a red sun on the front, a bright moon on the neck, and stars braided in his hair. The king marries her. Near the sons&#x27; delivery (in three consecutive pregnancies), Baba Yaga is brought to be the queen&#x27;s midwife. After each boy&#x27;s birth, she replaces them with a puppy, a kitten, and a block of wood. The queen is cast into the sea in a barrel with the animals and the object until they reach the shore. The puppy and the kitten act as the queen&#x27;s helper and rescue the three biological sons sitting on an oak tree.

Another tale was collected from a 70-year-old teller named Elizaveta Ivanovna Sidorova, in Tersky District, Murmansk Oblast, in 1957, by Dimitri M. Balashov. In her tale, &quot;Девять богатырей — по колен ноги в золоте, по локоть руки в серебре&quot; (&quot;Nine bogatyrs - up to the knees in gold, up to the elbows in silver&quot;), a girl promises to give birth to 9 sons with arms of silver and legs of gold, and the sun, moon, stars and a &quot;dawn&quot; adorning their heads and hair. A witch named yaga-baba replaced the boys with animals and things to trick the king. The queen is thrown in the sea with the animals, which act as her helpers. When yaga-baba, on the third visit, tells the king of a place where there are nine boys just as the queen described, the animals decide to rescue them.

In a tale collected from teller A. V. Chuprov with the title &quot;Федор-царевич, Иван-царевич и их оклеветанная мать&quot; (&quot;Fyodor Tsarevich, Ivan Tsarevich and their Calumniated Mother&quot;), a king passes by three servants and inquires them about their skills: the first says she can work with silk, the second can bake and cook, and the third says whoever marries her, she will bear him two sons, one with hands covered in gold and legs in silver, a sun on the front, stars on the sides and a moon on the back, and another with arms of a golden color and legs with a silvery tint. The king takes the third servant as his wife. The queen writes a letter to be delivered to the king, but the messenger stops by a bath house and its contents are altered to tell the king his wife gave birth to two puppies. The children are baptized and given the named Fyodor and Ivan. Ivan is given to another king, while the mother is cast in a barrel with Fyodor; both wash ashore on Buyan. Fyodor tries to make contact with some merchants on a ship. Fyodor reaches his father&#x27;s kingdom and overhears the conversation about the wondrous sights: a talking squirrel on a tree that tells fairy tales and a similar looking youth (his brother Ivan) on a distant kingdom. Fyodor steals a magic carpet, rescues Ivan and flies back to Buyan with his brother, a princess and an old woman. The tale was also classified as type 707, thus related to Russian tale &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;.

In a tale collected by Chudjakov with the title &quot;Der weise Iwan&quot; (&quot;The Wise Ivan&quot;), Ivan Tsarevich, the son of a tsar, pays a visit to a king and his three daughters. He listens to their conversation: the elder sister promises to weave trousers and shirts for the tsar&#x27;s son with a single flax; the middle one that she can weave the same with only a spool of thread, and the youngest that she can bear him six sons, the seventh a &quot;wise Ivan&quot;, and all of them with arms of gold up to the elbow, legs of silver up the knee and pearls in their hair. The tsar&#x27;s son marries the youngest sister, to the jealousy of the elder sisters. While Ivan Tsarevich goes to war, the jealous sisters join with a sorceress to defame the queen, by taking the children as soon as they are born and replace them for animals. After the third pregnancy, the queen and her son, wise Ivan, are cast in the sea in a barrel. The barrel washes ashore on an island and they live there. Some time later, merchants come to the island and later visit Ivan Tsarevich&#x27;s court to tell of strange sights they have seen: exotic felines (sables and martens); singing birds of paradise from the jealous sisters&#x27; aunt&#x27;s garden; and six sons with arms of gold, legs of silver and pearls in their hair. Wise Ivan returns to his mother and asks his mother to bake six cakes. Wise Ivan flies to the sorceress&#x27;s hut and rescues his brothers.

In a Northern Russian tale titled &quot;По колена ноги в золоти&quot; (&quot;Knee-deep in gold&quot;), a man has a daughter and marries a witch named Egibova, who also has a daughter. Egibova and her daughter mistreat the man&#x27;s daughter. One day, prince Ivan Tsarevich passes by their house; Egibova&#x27;s daughter promises to sew a fine shirt for him, and the man&#x27;s daughter promises to bear him two sons, with legs of gold, arms of silver and a pearl on their hair. The prince takes them to the palace, he marries the man&#x27;s daughter and weds Egibova&#x27;s daughter to the royal tailor. When it is time for Ivan&#x27;s wife to give birth, Egibova and her daughter prepare the bath house for her. She gives birth to her promised twins, but Egibova replaces them for a normal girl and a normal boy. Ivan Tsarevich, feeling outraged, orders her to be put in a barrel with her two sons and cast adrift in the sea. Meanwhile, Egibova takes the male twin and curses them to become wolves by day and humans by night, and hides them in a hut in the forest. Back to the barrel, it washes ashora. The man&#x27;s daughter, the boy (named Ivan) and the girl (named Marfa) come out of the barrel. Ivan asks his mother for a ring; he rubs the ring and two Cossacks appear to fulfill his wishes: to have a house built for them. Some time later, some merchants pass by their island, and Marfa turns into a louse and hides in a merchant&#x27;s hair. When the merchants visit Ivan Tsarevich and tell him about the island, Egobova interrupts their narration with her mother&#x27;s fantastical possessions: a mare&#x27;s foal with half of her body in silver; a singing cat (Kotpevun); and the twins with legs of gold, arms of silver and a pearl on their hair. Marfa shapeshifts into a fly and goes back to her mother and Ivan to report. After they learn of the twins, Ivan has two kolobokds made with their mother&#x27;s breast milk, and commands the Cossacks to take him there to the hut.

In a Russian tale collected from a Pomor source in Karelia and given the title &quot;Чудесные Дети&quot; (&quot;Во лбу солнце, на затылке месяц&quot;, or &quot;The Sun on the front, the Moon on the nape&quot;, in another publishing), a king orders his subjects to put out every light in the kingdom, and tells his son that whatever house is illuminated, there he shall find his bride. His son, the prince, who the king wishes to see married, agrees to his terms. At night, the prince takes a walk around the dark city and reaches a single illuminated house, where three sisters are talking to one another about their marriage wishes to Ivan Tsarevich: the elder sister boasts she can weave him a flying carpet, the middle one that she can sew a wide night with silk, and the youngest promises to bear him nine children in three pregnancies, all like bright falcons, each with the sun on the front, a moon on the back of their heads and stars on their braids. Ivan-Tsarevich overhears their conversation and marries the youngest. At the end of the first pregnancy, they have to search for a midwife, and find an old woman (&#x27;babka&#x27;) named Yazhenya. The old woman replaces the first three sons with kitties, the second three sons with puppies, and two of the third triplets with other animals. The first eight children are cursed by Yazhenya to run like wolves during the day, and become falcons at night, while their mother saves her last son and hides him in her braid. Believing in the midwives&#x27;s words, Ivan-Tsarevich orders that his wife is cast in the sea in barrel. His orders are carried out, and the princess is thrown in the sea with one of her sons, and they float adrift until they wash ashore on an island. The boy asks his mother about his father, and the princess says he has riches and ports. The boy then declares they should have the same, and his mother says &quot;from his mouth to God&#x27;s ears&quot;, and a castle and a port appear on the island. Later, some merchant traders pass by their island for supplies, then go to Ivan-Tsarevich&#x27;s court. There, they talk about a previously abandoned island now occupied by a woman and her son, and Yazhenya, dismissing their claims, boasts that her brother has a bull with a banya on its tail, a lake on its middle part, and a church on its head. On a second visit by the merchants, the witch mentions her brother has a crystal lake with margins of jelly that never wanes, with silver spoons nearby, and on the third visit, about eight brothers that become wolves by day and falcons by night. The boy wishes for the strange things on his island, and goes to rescue his brothers with some cakes made with milk. He breaks their animal curse and brings them all to the island.

In a tale collected in Vologda Oblast with the title &quot;Про царя и его детей&quot; (&quot;About the Tsar and his Children&quot;), a prince goes to look for a wife, and arrives at a house where three sisters are weaving. They talk to one another about their marriage wishes to the prince Ivan Tsarevich: the elder promises to feed the entire kingdom-state with a single grain, the middle one that she can clothe the entire kingdom-state with a single thread, and the youngest promises to bear him Vasya-Goldenlocks and Masha with diamond teeth. The prince announces he found his bride, and takes the youngest with him. They marry. When she is ready to give birth, the midwife replaces the twins for puppies and casts them in the sea. Ivan Tsarevich is tricked by the midwife and orders his wife to be placed on a hill to be spat on. Meanwhile, the twins Vasya and Masha are rescued from the water by an old couple. One day, when they are older, Masha dries her head with a towel that becomes gold. Their adoptive parents then decide to kill them for their hair and teeth, but the twins escape to another city, where they take refuge with an old woman. They grow up and, by selling golden towels, they become rich. Some time later, the old midwife learns of their survival and tells Vasya about a flower in the sea that can grant happiness, and about one of Koschei the Deathless&#x27;s twelve daughters he can choose as his wife. Vasya (called Vasil Tsarevich by a helpful witch) finds a helpful witch who advises him how to approach Koschei. The youth finds Elena, Koschei&#x27;s daughter, who also helps him in her father&#x27;s tests, and both escape in a magic flight sequence, by changing into objects to deceive him: a shepherdess (Elena) and a sheep (Vasya), and a church (Elena) and a priest (Vasya). Lastly, they throw behind a towel that creates a river of fire to apart Koschei from them. He asks for some help to cross the river; his daughter Elena throws him a towel for him to cross, and pulls it under him when he is in the middle of the river; he falls and dies. Elena and Vasya later go to a feast with the king and asks if a roasted duck can eat grains, to which Ivan Tsarevich says it cannot. Elena then retorts with a question: a woman can bear puppies? On this, Ivan Tsarevich recognizes his children.

In a Russian tale from Voronezh with the title &quot;ЦАРЬ И СЫН-БОГАТЫРЬ&quot; (&quot;Tsar and his Bogatyr Son&quot;), a prince is looking for a wife, but none is to his liking. One day, he learns that a woman in the village has three beautiful daughters and goes to their house to see them for himself. He meets them, but cannot decide yet, so he questions them: the elder promises to be occupy herself with domestic chores, the middle one with the cooking, and the youngest promises to bear him a bogatyr son. The prince chooses the third sister as his wife, but takes the elder sisters to live with him in the palace. Some time later, the prince has to depart for war and leaves his wife under her sisters&#x27; care. The princes gives birth to her bogatyr son and her sisters write the prince she gave birth to a snake. The prince writes in return that the women should expel or kill the princess. Out of pity for their cadette, they decide to place both mother and son in a barrel and cast them adrift in the ocean. Fortunately, the barrel washes ashore on an island, and mother and son live there until the boy grows up strong. Meanwhile, the prince returns from war and thinks that his wife and son are dead. Years later, the prince learns that a man bogatyr appeared on an island and decides to fight him, so he takes with him an army of 40 soldiers and marches to the island. The bogatyr defeats the prince&#x27;s army and takes him prisoner. The prince then asks the bogatyr his story, and the young man tells him about his and his mother&#x27;s maritime journey. The prince recognizes his son, takes him and his wife back to his palace, and punishes his sisters-in-law.

In a Russian tale collected in Bashkortostan with the title &quot;Про царя и его сына&quot; (&quot;About the Tsar and his Son&quot;), a tsar announces he wishes to marry a woman who will bear him a son with legs of gold up to the knee, arms of silver up to the elbow, and with a moon on the front. In the same kingdom, the youngest of three poor sisters agree to marry him, and bears him the prophesied boy. When the tsar is away, his wife sends an emissary with a letter, but he passes by the queen&#x27;s sisters&#x27; house, who falsify the missive and write it that the she gave birth to a puppy. On reading the false letter, the tsar orders his wife and son to be thrown in the sea in a barrel. His orders are carried out, but mother and son survive and wash ashore on an island. Some time later, war breaks out, and some soldiers pass by the island. The tsar&#x27;s son asks the purpose of the soldiers&#x27; stay, and gives them a bag of manure to be given to his father, the tsar. The soldiers return to the tsar&#x27;s court and deliver the presents, prompting the monarch&#x27;s curiosity. He goes to the island and reunites with his wife and son, then executes his sisters-in-law.

Russian linguist published a tale he titled &quot;Царь Салтан&quot; (&quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;). In this tale, three sisters are carding flax, when the elder wants to marry the tsar and boasts she can clothe the world with a single flax; the middle one that she can feed the whole world with a single ear of rye, and the younget promises to bear him three sons, with silver arms to the elbow, golden legs up to the knee, a moon on the front and stars on the nape. The tsar overhears their conversation and chooses the youngest as his wife. Soon, the elder sister begin to hate their cadette. When the tsar is in another land, the elder sisters bribe an old witch: after the queen gives birth to her three children, the witch writer a letter to the tsar saying that she gave birth to creatures. The tsar writes back with an order to place her elsewhere. Thus, the queen is put inside a barrel with her three sons and cast in the sea. While adrift, the boys grow up in hours and ask their mother to bless them. This causes the barrel to wash up ashore an island. They leave the barrel, then, with their mother&#x27;s blessing, the three boys begin to build a house on the island. Later, ships dock on the island, then go to report their finding to the tsar: on the island, three boys sing on a oak tree. The Tsar has curiosity piqued and is taken to this island, where he finds the youths on the oak, just as it was described. He then meets their mother, who explains they are youths with legs of gold, arms of silver, and astral birthmarks on their heads. She then bids her sons take off their caps to show the moon and the stars on their bodies. The tsar recognizes his wife and sons, and takes them back to his kingdom.

Russian philologist collected a tale from informant Elisaveta Ivanovna Sidorova (Russian: Елизавета Ивановна Сидорова), from Tersky region, in the White Sea. In this tale, titled &quot;Девять богатырей — по колен ноги в золоте, по локбть руки в серебре&quot; (&quot;Nine Bogatyrs - legs of gold up to the knee, arms of silver up to the elbow&quot;), a couple has three daughters. One night, they are talking, and the king, who is looking for a bride, overhears their conversation: the elder boasts she could weave cloths for the whole world if she was queen; the middle one that she could brew beer for the whole world, and the youngest promises to bear nine sons in three pregnancies, each with legs of gold up to the knee, arms of silver up to the elbow, the sun on the front, the moon on the nape, little stars in their hairs, and a shining dawn behind their ears. The king enters their room and chooses the third sister as his bride. They marry. When the king is away, the sisters hire Baba Yaga to hide the children. Each time, the queen gives birth to three sons, who are taken by Baba Yaga. The third time, the queen hides one of her children in her braids, while the witch hides the other two, then writes a false letter to inform the king she gave birth to a nondescript creature, and a second missive with a command to seal the woman in a barrel and cast her in the sea. The false orders are carried out, and the queen is cast in the barrel. While she sways on the waves, the son she rescued grows up very quickly and wishes they can be saved. With his mother&#x27;s blessing, who utters &quot;from his lips to God&#x27;s ears&quot;, the boy&#x27;s wishes are fulfilled, and they wash ashore on an island, then the barrel bursts off to release them. The boy soon wishes for a church to appear in the island, which appears overnight with houses, and a kalinov bridge to connect with the continent. Some beggars visit the island and admire the sights, then report back to the king. The queen&#x27;s son turns into a fly and spies on their conversation: the first time, the boy&#x27;s aunts boast that their aunt has a river of milk with jelly margins and red spoons for people to eat of it; the second time, about the existence of a thrice-bull with a bath house on its tail, a lake under it body, and a church on its horns; the third time, the aunts talk about eight brothers in a field with members of gold and silver and astral birthmarks on their heads. After the first and second visits, the boy tells his mother about the strange sights and, with her blessed words, both the river of milk and the thrice-bull appear to them. The third time, the queen reveals the eight siblings are her son&#x27;s elder brothers. The boy decides to rescue them and asks his mother to bake nine kolachkis, and goes to look for his brothers. He reaches a hut in the meadow, places the kolachikis on the table, then lies in waiting; eight pigeons fly in and become humans, then eat the kolachkis. The boy appears to them and the siblings fly together to their mother in pigeon form. At the end of the tale, the same beggars visit the island again and inform the king about the marvels on the island, the last of which nine brothers with members of gold and silver and astral birthmarks. The king decides to move out to this island and reunites with his wife and sons.

====Belarus====
Russian folklorist , in a systematic study about the Belarusian folktales, termed tale type 707 as Belarusian &quot;Дзівосныя дзеці&quot; (English: &quot;Wonderful Children&quot;): a king overhears three sisters talking, the youngest promising to bear wonderful children; he marries the third sister, whose children are replaced for animals by her elder sisters or a witch; the third sister and her children are cast in the sea in a barrel; they survive and her son founds a kingdom and rescues his brothers. Barag also referred to &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;, by Pushkin, as comparable to the Belarusian type.

Ethnographer and folklorist collected a tale with the title &quot;Дуб Дорохвей&quot; or &quot;Дуб Дарахвей&quot; (&quot;The Dorokhveï Oak&quot;) (fr), published in his collection &quot;Belorussky Sbornik&quot; (&quot;A Belarusian Compilation&quot;). In this tale, a widowed old man marries another woman, who detests his three daughters and orders her husband to dispose of them. The old man takes them to the swamp and abandons the girls there. They notice that their father is not with them, take refuge under a pine tree and begin to cry over their situation, their tears producing a river. The tsar, seeing the river, orders their servants to find its source. They find the three maidens and take them to the king, who inquires about their origin: they say they were expelled from home. The tsar asks each maiden what they can do, and the youngest says she will give birth to 12 sons, their legs of gold, their waist of silver, the moon on the forehead and a small star on the back of the neck. The tsar chooses the third sister, and she bears the 12 sons while he is away. The sisters falsify a letter with a lie that she gave birth to animals and she should be thrown in the sea in a barrel. Eleven of her sons are put in a leather bag and thrown in the sea, but they wash ashore on an island where the Dorokhveï Oak lies. The oak is hollowed, so they make their residence there. Meanwhile, mother and her 12th son are thrown in the sea in a barrel, but leave the barrel as soon as it washes ashore on another island. The son tells her he will rescue his eleven brothers by asks her to bake cakes with her breastmilk. After the siblings are reunited, the son turns into an insect to spy on his aunts and eavesdrop on the conversation about the kingdom of wonders, one of them, a cat that walks and tells stories and tales. The tale was also translated to German language as &quot;Die Eiche Dorochvej&quot; (&quot;The Oak Dorokhvei&quot;), and classified as tale type ATU 707, although it belongs to a form of the story that appears among the East Slavs and more popularly known thanks to &quot;Tsar Saltan&quot;.

Ethnographer Evdokim Romanov published another tale in the same collection, sourced from a peasant teller in Baranovsky. In this tale, titled &quot;Гвідон Саміхлёнавіч&quot; (&quot;Gvidon Samikhlenavich&quot;), an old couple have twelve sons and twelve daughters. One day, they marry all of their sons and nine of their daughters, leaving three unmarried: Arina, Agatha-Salikhvata Premudraya and Nastasya-Prikrasya Dimionavna. Each of their girls ask for their parents&#x27; blessings: Arina for a needle and a thread, Agatha for one grain of rye, and Nastasya for a blessing to give birth to fifteen bogatyr sons with the sun on the front, the moon on the back of the neck, feet of silver, hands of gold and with stars all over their bodies. Then they leave home and go to bathe in the sea in the shape of ducks, after they doff their jeweled robes. Soon enough, king Gvidon Samikhlenavich finds the robes and hides them. The girls leave the sea and try to find their garments. King Gvidon appears and agrees to return the clothes, and inquires them about their abilities: Arina says she can sew all of his clothes with a single needle and thread, Agatha that she can feed him with a single grain of rye, and Nastasya that she will bear him fifteen boys with astral birthmarks. King Gvidon chooses Nastasya as his wife and marries her, while also taking her elder sisters to clothe and feed his army. In time, Nastasya is pregnant with five boys in a first pregnancy, and King Gvidon is forced to depart to fight against Tsar Shkarlupin. While he is away, Arina takes her nephews as soon as they are born and casts them in the water in a barrel, then places five puppies in their place. The same thing happens during the next pregnancies: King Gvidon goes away on war to fight against enemy kings (Tsar Shkarlyhayushchi in the second time, and Khvedar Tirin Birdibiyanovich in the third time), his wife becomes pregnant and gives birth to five sons; her elder sister Arina casts the boys in the sea in a barrel and replaces them for animals (hounds in the second time, and kitten in the third). In the third pregnancy, Arina leaves her sister, Queen Nastasya, with a single remaining son, Ivan Gvidononich, while she casts the other four in the sea. King Gvidon returns home and, after falling for his sister-in-law&#x27;s deception, orders his wife and son to be thrown in the sea in a barrel. His orders are carried out: they place her in, put provisions and gold and silver along with the two, and release them in the sea. Prince Ivan Gvidonovich grows up in hours to a 25 young man and the barrel washes ashore on an island. After they leave the barrel, Ivan Gvidonich utters that a palace of white marble stone with a vineyard should appear on the island, and it happens so; he also wants a golden and silver bridge to appear, and his wish is granted. Later, sailors visit the island, then go to report to King Gvidon about the splendid sights they saw. However, each time his aunt Arina replies with an even more wondrous marvel: first, she mentions a giant oak with twelve trees, twelve goats on them, with twelve bells each; next, she cites fourteen young people that play and sing all day without having to stop to eat or drink, and their fourteen horses with golden and silver mane and hooves that vent fire from their nostrils. Spying on his father&#x27;s court as a little bird, Ivan Gvidonovich then returns to his mother&#x27;s island and wishes to have the large oak on the tree the first time, and, after the second visit, he realizes the fourteen young people are his lost elder brothers. He then wishes for a horse to bring him to the distant kingdom, and reaches his brothers. They greet each other, but the fourteen young men ask their cadet to bring some cheese made of their mother&#x27;s breastmilk, since their lips are black and they have not suckled on their mother&#x27;s milk as children. Ivan Gvidonovich returns to his mother, prepares the cheese with queen Nastasya&#x27;s breastmilk, then returns to deliver his brothers the requested food. After their blood relationship is confirmed, the retinue go to Queen Nastasya&#x27;s island and rejoin their mother. At the end of the tale, the sailors returns to King Gvidon&#x27;s court to tell about the island with the large oak and the fifteen boys on their fiery horses, prompting the king to go visit it. King Gvidon recognizes his wife and sons, then punishes his sister-in-law Arina, and goes to live with his son on his island. Belarusian folklorists and Galina A. Bartashevich, as well as Russian folklorist Lev Barag, classified the tale as East Slavic type SUS 707, and listed it as a Belarusian variant of the tale type.

====Ukraine====
In a Ukrainian tale, &quot;Песинський, жабинський, сухинський і золотокудрії сини цариці&quot; (&quot;Pesynsky, Zhabynsky, Sukhynsky and the golden-haired sons of the queen&quot;), three sisters are washing clothes in the river when they see in the distance a man rowing a boat. The oldest says it might be God, and if it is, may He take her, because she can feed many with a piece of bread. The second says it might be a prince, so she says she wants him to take her, because she will be able to weave clothes for a whole army with just a yarn. The third recognizes him as the tsar, and promises that, after they marry, she will give birth to twelve sons with golden curls. When the girl, now queen, gives birth, the old midwife takes the children, tosses them in a well and replaces them with dog, toad and an ugly dry kid, respectively. After the third birth, the tsar consults his ministers and they advise him to cast the queen and her animal children in the sea in a barrel. The barrel washes ashore an island and the three animals build a castle and a glass bridge to mainland. When some sailors visit the island, they visit the tsar to report on the strange sights on the island. The old midwife, however, interrupts their narration by revealing somewhere else there is something even more fantastical. Pesynsky, Zhabynsky and Sukhynsky spy on their audience and run away to fetch these things and bring them to their island. At last, the midwife reveals that there is a well with three golden-curled sons inside, and Pesynsky, Zhabynsky and Sukhynsky rescue them. The same sailors visit the strange island (this time the true sons of the tsar are there) and report their findings to the tsar, who discovers the truth and orders the midwife to be punished. Folklorist translated the tale to German as &quot;Der Hundesohn, der Froschsohn, der magere Sohn und die goldlockigen Söhne der Zarin&quot; (&quot;The Dogson, the Frogson, the skinny Son, and the Tsarina&#x27;s golden-haired sons&quot;), and indexed it as type 707. According to scholarship, professor Lev Grigorevich Barag noted that this sequence (dog helping the calumniated mother in finding the requested objects) appears as a variation of the tale type 707 only in Ukraine, Russia, Bashkir and Tuvan.

In a tale summarized by folklorist Mykola Sumtsov with the title &quot;Завистливая жена&quot; (&quot;The Envious Wife&quot;), the girl promises to bear a son with a golden star on the forehead and a moon on his navel. She is persecuted by her sister-in-law.

In a South Russian (Ukrainian) variant collected by Ukrainian folklorist , &quot;Богатырь з бочки&quot; (&quot;The Bogatyr in a barrel&quot;), after the titular bogatyr is thrown in the sea with his mother, he spies on the false queen to search the objects she describes: a cat that walks on a chain, a golden bridge near a magical church and a stone-grinding windmill that produces milk and eight falcon-brothers with golden arms up to the elbow, silver legs up to the knees, golden crown, a moon on the front and stars on the temples.

Baltic-German scholar Walter Anderson located a variant first collected by Russian historian from students in Odessa, but whose manuscript has been lost. However, Anderson managed to reconstruct a summary of the tale: Ivan Carevic overhears three sisters talking in a castle about their marriage wishes: all three wish to marry Ivan Carevic, but the eldest wants to sew him a silken shirt; the middle one a shirt with white seams, and the youngest promises to bear him three sons, the first with a Sun on the front, the second with a Moon, and the youngest with stars. Ivan Carevic marries the third sister and she gives birth to her promises wonder children in three consecutive pregnancies, but the babies are replaced by the jealous aunts for a puppy, a kitten, and a normal boy. Ivan Carevic then orders his wife and the normal boy to be thrown in the water in a barrel. Inside the barrel, the normal boy grows up quickly and, with his magical powers, wishes them to reach an island and be safe. The normal boy rescues the queen&#x27;s biological sons. Ivan Carevic reunites with his wife and children and punishes his sisters-in-law.

===Baltic languages===
====Latvia====
According to the Latvian Folktale Catalogue, tale type 707, &quot;The Three Golden Children&quot;, is known in Latvia as &quot;Brīnuma bērni&quot; (&quot;Miraculous Children&quot;), comprising 4 different redactions. Its &quot;first&quot; redaction registers the highest number of tales and follows &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;: the king marries the youngest of three sisters, because she promises to bear him many children with miraculous traits, her sisters replace the children for animals and their youngest is cast into the sea in a barrel with one of her sons; years later, her son seeks the strange wonders the sisters mention (a cat that dances and tells stories, and a group of male brothers that appear somewhere on a certain place).

====Lithuania====
According to professor , the tale type is reported to register 244 (two hundred and forty-four) Lithuanian variants, under the banner &quot;Three Extraordinary Babies&quot;, with and without contamination from other tale types. However, only 39 variants in Lithuania contain the quest for the strange sights and animals described to the king. Kerbelytė also remarks that many Lithuanian versions of this format contain the motif of baking bread with the hero&#x27;s mother&#x27;s breastmilk to rescue the hero&#x27;s brothers.

In a variant published by Fr. Richter under the title &quot;Die drei Wünsche&quot; (&quot;The Three Wishes&quot;), three sisters spend an evening talking and weaving, the youngest saying she would like to have a son, bravest of all and loyal to the king. The king appears, takes the sisters, and marries the youngest. Her son is born and grows up exceptionally fast, much to the king&#x27;s surprise. One day, he goes to war and sends a letter to his wife to send their son to the battlefield. The queen&#x27;s jealous sisters intercept the letter and send him a frog dressed in fine clothes. The king is enraged and replies with a written order to cast his wife in the water. The sisters throw the queen and her son in the sea in a barrel, but they wash ashore in an island. The prince saves a hare from a fox. The prince asks the hare about recent events. Later, the hare is disenchanted into a princess with golden eyes and silver hair, who marries the prince.

====Zaonezh&#x27;ya====
In a tale from with the title &quot;Про Ивана-царевича&quot; (&quot;About Ivan-Tsarevich&quot;), recorded in 1982, three sisters in a bath house talk among themselves, the youngest says she will bear nine sons with golden legs, silver arms and pearls in their hair. She marries Ivan-Tsarevich. A local witch named Yegibikha, who wants her daughter, Beautiful Nastasya, to marry Ivan, acts as the new queen&#x27;s midwife and replaces eight of her sons for animals. The last son and mother are thrown into the sea in a barrel and wash ashore on an island. The child grows up in days and asks his mother to prepare koluboks with her breastmilk. He rescues his brothers with the koluboks and takes them to the island. Finally, the son wishes that a bridge appears between the island and the continent, and that visitors come to their new home. As if granting his wish, an old beggar woman comes and visits the island, and later goes to Ivan-Tsarevich to tell him about it.

<text>Urbano Pio Francesco Rattazzi (; 29 June 1808 5 June 1873) was an Italian politician and statesman.

==Personal life==
He was born in Alessandria, Piedmont. He studied law at Turin, and in 1838 began his practice, which met with marked success at the capital and Casale. His wife, Laetitia Marie Wyse Bonaparte, whom he married in 1863, was a noted French novelist and a grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I. Together they had one daughter: Romana Rattazzi (1871–1943).

==Career==
In 1848, Rattazzi was sent to the Sardinian chamber of deputies in Turin as representative of his native town. He allied himself with the Liberal party, i.e. Democrats. By his debating powers, he contributed to the defeat of the Balbo ministry, and in August received the portfolio of Public Instruction, though he left office after a few days. In December, in the Gioberti cabinet, he became Minister of the Interior, and on the fall of Gioberti, in February 1849, Rattazzi was entrusted with the formation of a new cabinet. The defeat at Novara compelled Rattazzi&#x27;s resignation in March 1849.

He left the Democrats for the Moderate Liberals, and formed the group of the center-left. This party formed a coalition with the center-right headed by Cavour. This coalition was known as the &quot;connubio&quot;, i.e. the union of the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about the fall of the d&#x27;Azeglio cabinet in November 1852 and the organization of a new ministry by Cavour. Rattazzi gave up a Parliament presidency in 1853 to become Minister of Justice and later Minister of the Interior. As Minister of the Interior, he carried a number of measures of reform, including that for the suppression of certain of the monastic orders, partial secularization of church property, and restricting the influence of the religious associations. This precipitated a bitter struggle with the Clerical party. During a momentary reaction of public opinion he resigned office in 1858, but again entered the cabinet under La Marmora in 1859 as Minister of the Interior.

In consequence of the negotiations for the cession of Nice and Savoy to France, which cession he opposed, he again retired in January 1860. On changing his views on this policy, he became president of the lower chamber in the first Italian Parliament, and in March 1862 succeeded Ricasoli in the government, retaining for himself the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and of the Interior. However, in consequence of his policy of repression towards Garibaldi at Aspromonte, he was driven from office in the following December. He was again Prime Minister in 1867, from April to October. Popular reaction to his hostility to Garibaldi again drove him from office. He died at Frosinone on 5 June 1873.

<doc id="784449" wikidata="Q516665" url="?curid=784449" title="Blue-crowned hanging parrot">
<text>The blue-crowned hanging parrot (Loriculus galgulus) is a parrot species endemic to southern Burma and Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, and Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Borneo). These parrots are in height and weight g and have a longevity of 14 years. They are recognized by their green plumage, black beak and characteristic blue feathers arranged like a crown on their head.

==Taxonomy==
The blue-crowned hanging parrot was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus galgulus&quot;. The type locality is the Malaysian state of Malacca. The blue-crowned hanging parrot is now one of 14 hanging parrots placed in the genus &quot;Loriculus&quot; that was introduced in 1849 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth. The genus name is a diminutive of the genus &quot;Lorius&quot; that was introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors for the lorys in 1825. The specific epithet &quot;galgulus&quot; is an unidentified small bird described by the Roman author Pliny the Elder  as hanging by its feet. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Blue-crowned hanging parrots have green plumage and adults have black beaks. There is sexual dimorphism between males and females of the species. Adult males have a characteristic blue &quot;crown&quot; patch on their head and a red mark on their throat as well as a red rump bordered by a yellow lower back. Adult females plumage is duller green in color compared to the males, they do not have the red throat mark and have a less apparent or absent blue crown on the head and lack yellow feathers on their lower back. Juveniles&#x27; plumage is dull green, they also have little to no blue crown patch, they have a little to no blue crown visible and their bills are light in color. 

The calls these birds make when flying are shrill and squeaky. When flying in flocks, the calls can be described as rapid and ringing. As they forage, they utter shrill two-syllable calls.

== Distribution and habitat==
The blue-crowned hanging parrot is distributed throughout southern Thailand, western Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo and other nearby islands. The parrot inhabits forests, forest edges, swamps, riverine forest, bamboo patches, mangrove wooded gardens, and coconut groves, as well as plantations.

Throughout its range, Sulawesi is the only area where more than one &quot;Loriculus&quot; species is found because intraspecific competition usually prevents other closely related species from overlapping.

==Behaviour==
The hanging parrot can be observed travelling alone, in pairs, or in parties of 150 individuals in the canopy. During the mating season, bonded pairs will remain together and the male will chase off any other male that approaches. 

Characteristic of hanging parrots, the blue-crowned hanging parrot sleeps upside down by hanging from tree branches. The birds climb or fly up tall trees and will hang by either both feet or only one foot and will fluff their feathers and tuck their head and neck into their body. This behaviour evolved in order to limit nighttime predation. The parrot&#x27;s green plumage and hanging sleeping position imitates leaves among trees to camouflage themselves among the foliage. This behaviour was likely evolved from a common ancestor of Loriculus and Agapornis parrots endemic to Africa.

Young and sick birds are unable to hang and will perch sitting upright to sleep with their head turned to one side while tucked into the back feathers. Young birds have undeveloped modifications necessary for hanging but develop these rapidly as they fledge.

===Breeding===
The blue-crowned hanging parrot forms bonded pairs during January to July for the breeding season. In order to court a female, the male will display by strutting; where the red rump, tail coverts, and red throat feathers are fluffed up. The male will erect his body and spread his tail and bob his head while running across a branch or perch. With wings held low, he makes soft twittery &quot;jeet jeet&quot; call while showing off his red and gold rump on his lower back to nearby females. In response, a female who is not impressed by the male will react aggressively by chasing him away, or she may act indifferently. If the female is interested in the male, she will actively encourage him and accept food from him. The pair&#x27;s bond is maintained in this species through courtship feeding where the male will regurgitate food and offer it to a female. The female who accepts the food will perch close to the male and they then spend most of their time together.

The parrots will carry nesting material in their contour feathers by tucking them with their beaks. The nests are built by the bird in natural cavities like open tree branches and made out of substrate like bark and leaves the bird finds in its habitat. The females have a gestation period of 20 days where she will incubate her eggs inside the nest. A single clutch can have up to 4 eggs and the chicks leave the nest about 33 days after hatching.

===Food and feeding===
Hanging parrots eat mainly fruits, such as papaya and rambutan, in the wild but will also feed on palm oil nuts, seeds, nectar, and fresh flowers. The blue-crowned hanging parrot employs different feeding methods. Young birds usually use their mandibles to nibble and break off pieces of food when perching and will flick their heads rapidly to remove the pulp after extracting its juice. Adults use their feet or bills to carry food and will feed when perching. Feeding usually occurs away from the food source after being carried to a perch. The bird can bring the food held up by the foot to its beak to feed and they can also hold up their foot and lower their head to feed. Other methods involve holding the food between its claws on the perch and lowering the head completely to feed.

== Relationship to humans ==
This species is commonly called Serindit Melayu in the Riau province and are typically kept as pets. The blue-crowned hanging parrot are important to the flora and Riau identity. Its name is used in &quot;Hulu Keris&quot;, an important symbol of the province as part of the traditional clothing of Riau symbolizing courage, wisdom when upholding truth and justice. In Riau folklore stories of the faunal world, the hanging parrot is referred to as Panglima Hijau. In Malay literature, the blue-crowned hanging parrot symbolically represents love and is considered a love-bird. It is also commonly referred to in rhymes and poetry and is used in ritual activities.

<text>The Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius () is a lavra and the most important Russian monastery, being the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church. The monastery is situated in the town of Sergiyev Posad, about to the northeast from Moscow by the road leading to Yaroslavl, and currently is home to over 300 monks.

==History==
===14th century===

The monastery was founded in 1337 by one of the most venerated Russian saints, Sergius of Radonezh, who built a wooden church in honour of the Holy Trinity on Makovets Hill. Early development of the monastic community is well documented in contemporary lives of Sergius and his disciples. 

In 1355, Sergius introduced a charter which required the construction of auxiliary buildings, such as refectory, kitchen, and bakery. This charter was a model for Sergius&#x27; numerous followers who founded more than 400 monasteries all over Russia, including the celebrated Solovetsky, Kirillov, and Simonov monasteries.

St. Sergius supported Dmitri Donskoi in his struggle against the Tatars and sent two of his monks, Peresvet and Oslyabya, to participate in the Battle of Kulikovo (1380). At the outbreak of the battle, Peresvet died in a single combat against a Tatar bogatyr. The monastery was devastated by fire, when a Tatar unit raided the area in 1408.

===15th century===

St. Sergius was declared patron saint of the Russian state in 1422. The same year the first stone cathedral was built by a team of Serbian monks who had found refuge in the monastery after the Battle of Kosovo. The relics of St. Sergius still may be seen in this cathedral, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The greatest icon painters of medieval Russia, Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny, were summoned to decorate the cathedral with frescoes. Traditionally, Muscovite royals were baptized in this cathedral and held thanksgiving services here.

In 1476, Ivan III invited several Pskovian masters to build the church of the Holy Spirit. This structure is one of the few remaining examples of a Russian church topped with a belltower. The interior contains the earliest specimens of the use of glazed tiles for decoration. In the early 16th century, Vasily III added the Nikon annex and the Serapion tent, where several of Sergius&#x27; disciples were interred.

===16th century===
It took 26 years to construct the six-pillared Assumption Cathedral, which was commissioned by Ivan the Terrible in 1559. The cathedral is much larger than its model and namesake in the Moscow Kremlin. The magnificent iconostasis of the 16th–18th centuries features Simon Ushakov&#x27;s masterpiece, the icon of Last Supper. The interior walls were painted with violet and blue frescoes by a team of Yaroslavl masters in 1684. The vault contains burials of Boris Godunov, his family and several 20th-century patriarchs.

As the monastery grew into one of the wealthiest landowners in Russia, the woods where it had stood were cleared and a village (or posad) sprang up near the monastery walls. It gradually developed into the modern town of Sergiyev Posad. The cloister itself was a notable centre of chronicle-writing and icon painting. Just opposite the monastery walls St. Paraskeva&#x27;s Convent was established, among whose buildings St. Paraskeva&#x27;s Church (1547), Introduction Church (1547), and a 17th-century chapel over St. Paraskeva&#x27;s well are still visible.

===17th century===

In 1550s, a wooden palisade surrounding the cloister was replaced with long stone walls, featuring twelve towers, which helped the monastery to withstand a celebrated 16-month Polish-Lithuanian siege in 1608–1610. A shell-hole in the cathedral gates is preserved as a reminder of Wladyslaw IV&#x27;s abortive siege in 1618.

By the end of the 17th century, when young Peter I twice found refuge within the monastery from his enemies, numerous buildings had been added. These include a small baroque palace of the patriarchs, noted for its luxurious interiors, and a royal palace, with its facades painted in checkerboard design. The refectory of St. Sergius, covering and also painted in dazzling checkerboard design, used to be the largest hall in Russia. The five-domed Church of John the Baptist&#x27;s Nativity (1693–1699) was commissioned by the Stroganovs and built over one of the gates. Other 17th-century structures include the monks&#x27; cells, a hospital topped with a tented church, and a chapel built over a holy well discovered in 1644.

===18th and 19th centuries===

In 1744, Empress Elizabeth conferred on the cloister the dignity of a Lavra. The metropolitan of Moscow was henceforth also the Archimandrite of the Lavra. Elizabeth particularly favoured the Trinity and annually proceeded afoot from Moscow to the cloister. Her secret spouse Alexey Razumovsky accompanied her on such journeys and commissioned a baroque church to the Virgin of Smolensk, the last major shrine to be erected in the Lavra. Another pledge of Elizabeth&#x27;s affection for the monastery is a white-and-blue baroque belltower, which, at 88 meters, was one of the tallest structures built in Russia up to that date. Its architects were Ivan Michurin and Dmitry Ukhtomsky.

Throughout the 19th century, the Lavra maintained its status as the richest Russian monastery. A seminary founded in 1742 was replaced by an ecclesiastical academy in 1814. The monastery boasted a supreme collection of manuscripts and books. 
Medieval collections of the Lavra sacristy attracted thousands of visitors. In Sergiyev Posad, the monastery maintained several sketes, one of which is a place of burial for the conservative philosophers Konstantin Leontiev and Vasily Rozanov.

===20th century===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet government closed the lavra in 1920. Its buildings were assigned to different civic institutions or declared museums. Part was used for training electrical engineers specialising in radio. In May 1923 Charles Ashleigh reported how the hall was used to demonstrate the new radio technology before a mixed audience primarily composed of peasants and soldiers, but with some townspeople. The broadcast started with an announcement followed by music with a band from the Moscow cavalry playing &quot;Stenka Razin&quot;. Then the audience were treated to a short lecture on the benefits of chemical manure and machine ploughs. After a gypsy song the performance was brought to a conclusion with a talk about the wonders of radio. In 1930, monastery bells, including the Tsar-Bell of 65 tons, were destroyed. Pavel Florensky and his followers prevented the authorities from stealing and selling the sacristy collection but overall many valuables were lost or transferred to other collections.
In 1945, following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s temporary tolerance of the church during World War II, the Lavra was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. On April 16, 1946 divine service was renewed at the Assumption Cathedral. The lavra continued as the seat of the Moscow Patriarchate until 1983, when the patriarch was allowed to settle at the Danilov Monastery in Moscow. 
After that, the monastery continued as a prime centre of religious education. Important restoration works were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1993, the Trinity Lavra was inscribed on the UN World Heritage List.

The Lavra has a number of representative churches (&quot;podvorie&quot; or &quot;metochia&quot;) in its vicinity and throughout Russia. The Lavra&#x27;s hieromonks have manned a number of sketes at remote locations (such as the Anzer Island in the Solovki Archipelago in the White Sea), as well as Trinity Church on King George Island in the Antarctic.

<text>Robert O&#x27;Billovich, nicknamed &quot;Bobby O&quot; or &quot;Obie&quot;, (born June 30, 1940) is an east regional scout for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL). O&#x27;Billovich has been involved with the CFL since 1963 in the roles of player, coach, general manager, scout, and several front-office positions. As a long-time coach in the CFL, he won 107 regular season games in the CFL, the eighth highest win total by a head coach in the league&#x27;s history.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Billovich was born and raised in Butte, Montana, where he was an outstanding football and basketball player at Butte High School. At Butte HS he lettered three years in basketball and two years in football; making All State in both sports. He also lettered in track and played shortstop on the Butte American Legion baseball team.

==NCAA college basketball==
After graduating from high school in Butte, Montana, O&#x27;Billovich went to Missoula, Montana to attend Montana State University (later renamed the University of Montana). He played in the NCAA in football, basketball and baseball, where he started in all three sports for three years. O&#x27;Billovich started three years in football for Montana as a quarterback and defensive back (1959–1961). In addition, O&#x27;Billovich was a starting guard in basketball (1960–1962) and the starting shortstop in baseball for Montana (1960–1962). He was an all-Skyline Conference selection in all three sports. He also lettered at least one year in track for Montana. He was named University of Montana &quot;Athlete of the Decade&quot; for 1960–1970, and inducted to the University of Montana&#x27;s &quot;Grizzly Athletic Hall of Fame&quot; in 1993.

==Professional career==
O&#x27;Billovich began his CFL career with the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1963 as a defensive back and backup quarterback. He also served as a backup placekicker, completed his only one-point convert attempt. He recorded 24 interceptions over 69 games with the Rough Riders between 1963 and 1967 before ending his playing career.

==Basketball coaching career==
Bob O&#x27;Billovich was coach of the Carleton University Ravens CIAU men&#x27;s basketball team from 1971 to 1973. From 1973 to 1974, O&#x27;Billovich served as head coach for the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees men&#x27;s basketball team.

==Football administrative career==
In 1974, O&#x27;Billovich launched his CFL coaching career with the Rough Riders, first as a guest coach, and then assistant coach.

O&#x27;Billovich was named head coach of the Toronto Argonauts in 1982, a position he held until 1989. During his tenure at Toronto, the Argonauts appeared in the Grey Cup three times (1982, 1983, 1987), winning the Cup in 1983. He was honoured as CFL Coach of the Year in 1982 and 1987.

Bob O&#x27;Billovich joined the BC Lions in midseason on September 14, 1990, as general manager and interim coach. The Lions had been off to a dismal 2–8-1 start that season; they finished the season with an improved 6–11-1 record. O&#x27;Billovich remained as head coach of the Lions through the end of the 1992 season, a year in which the Lions finished at 3–15.

In 1993, O&#x27;Billovich returned to the Argonauts as general manager. The Argos began that season poorly, and O&#x27;Billovich took over as head coach on September 10, 1993. He coached for the remainder of the 1993 season and for the entirety of the 1994 season. At the end of the 1994 season, O&#x27;Billovich relinquished the head coach position to concentrate on his general manager duties. The Argos again had a poor start for the 1995 season and O&#x27;Billovich took over as head coach for the final nine games after firing Mike Faragalli; the team finished the season with a lackluster 4–14 record. He finished with 89 career regular season wins as a head coach of the Argonauts, which is the most in franchise history.

O&#x27;Billovich was director of player personnel with the Lions from 2003 to 2007. In December 2007, O&#x27;Billovich was hired as general manager by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. On January 12, 2012, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats announced his promotion to Vice President of football operations. On December 17, 2012, Kent Austin replaced O&#x27;Billovich as the Tiger-Cats&#x27; GM when he was also hired as the team&#x27;s new head coach.

He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

Most of the music of that album was composed by Sevara. She brought two producers to work on this album – Bruno Ellingham and Victor Sologoub. In 2009, Sevara released a hit song titled &quot;А Он Не Пришёл&quot; in Russian, which became a major hit throughout the CIS countries.

Sevara&#x27;s &quot;Tortadur&quot; – a collection of Uzbek traditional/classical songs – was released in the US on 11 October 2011, on her own record label, Sevaramusic. Sevara invited &quot;the old school&quot; instrumentalists for the live recording sessions. This album is not electronically treated.

<text>Sotkamo is a municipality of Finland, located in the Kainuu region about east of Kajaani, the capital of Kainuu. Vuokatti, in west of Sotkamo, is the most populous village in the municipality and also a popular skiing resort. Both Hiidenportti National Park and Tiilikkajärvi National Park are located in the municipality.

The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

In sports, Sotkamo is known for its pesäpallo team, Sotkamon Jymy. The Hiukka Stadium is the home field of Sotkamon Jymy, and its well-known competitor is Vimpelin Veto from Vimpeli, known as long-time arch-enemy of Sotkamon Jymy.

One of the major landmarks of Sotkamo is the sandy beach of Hiukka, which locates by the lake Iso Sapsojärvi, just beside the Sotkamo center. In Vuokatti ski center you can find the lake Nuasjärvi and the Vuokatti Hill.

==History==
Sotkamo has grown beside a water route formed by a continuous band of lakes and rivers. The waters of the Sotkamo route run through Kajaaninjoki into Oulujärvi and finally to the Baltic Sea, but in the past the waterways also created an important commercial route to White Sea in the east. The same water route has been used by soldiers of Russia, Sweden and Denmark to rob and ravage this remote countryside for centuries. The name Sotkamo comes either from the Finnish word &quot;sotku&quot; which means a mess and refers to the obscure water route, or from the word &quot;sotka&quot; which was a general name for water birds in ancient Finnish and now designates the common goldeneye.

During the 19th century Sotkamo was visited by notable Finnish artists such as Akseli Gallen-Kallela and Hugo Simberg.

On November 17, 2007 first pictures of the Kern arc were made in the town of Sotkamo by Marko Mikkilä.

<doc id="784500" wikidata="Q1404337" url="?curid=784500" title="Piton">
<text>A piton (; also called pin or peg) in big wall climbing and in aid climbing is a metal spike (usually steel) that is driven into a crack or seam in the climbing surface using a climbing hammer, and which acts as an anchor for protecting the climber from falling or to assist progress in aid climbing. Pitons are equipped with an eye hole or a ring to which a carabiner is attached; the carabiner can then be directly or indirectly connected to a climbing rope.

Pitons were the original form of protection and are still used where there is no alternative. Repeated hammering and extraction of pitons damage the rock, and climbers who subscribe to the clean climbing ethic avoid their use as much as possible. With the popularization of clean climbing in the 1970s, pitons were largely replaced by faster and easier-to-use clean protection, such as nuts and camming devices. Pitons are still found in place (as &quot;fixed&quot; pitons) on some established free climbing routes, as fixed belay station anchors, in places where nuts or cams do not work; and are used on some hard aid climbs.

==Types==

Pitons are sized and manufactured to fit a wide range of cracks. From small to large, the most common are:

* RURP (Realized Ultimate Reality Piton) – a tiny piton the size of a postage stamp used in thin, shallow seams. It was designed by Tom Frost and Yvon Chouinard in 1959 and was manufactured by Chouinard Equipment in the 1960s. It is not a strong piece, and is mainly used for aid climbing, although it can feature as protection on extreme free routes (e.g. Rurp The Wild Berserk (E6 6b) at The Brand, Leicestershire, UK).
* Beak – hooking pitons with the ability to hook, which can be placed without a hammer. Known often as Birdbeaks named for Jim Bridwell whose nickname was &quot;The Bird&quot;. 
* Knifeblade – also known as a bugaboos, are thin straight pitons, that work in thin, deep cracks.
* Lost Arrow – also known as a wedge piton, was designed by John Salathé and Yvon Chouinard (named after Salathé&#x27;s ascent of Lost Arrow Spire), is a hot-forged, tapered piton for medium-sized cracks.
* Angle – A piton made of steel sheet bent into a &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, or &quot;Z&quot; shape; works well for larger cracks, where the steel deforms elastically as the piton is placed.
* Bong – The largest pitons are angles made from sheet aluminum called a bong, named for the sound they produce while being hammered into place (or dropped). Largely replaced by camming units and nuts (chocks) that perform better and without damaging the rock.

==Development==

Early pitons were made of malleable iron and soft steel and would deform to the shape of a crack when hammered into the rock, which worked well in the irregular cracks found on European limestone. Soft pitons are difficult to remove without damaging the piton, so they were left in place and became fixed anchor points on a climb.

During the exploration of the hard granite in Yosemite Valley in the 1950s and 1960s, it was found that soft pitons did not work well. The long routes developed in Yosemite made it impractical and costly to fix routes, and the soft pitons were not durable enough to be placed and removed more than a few times. Pitons needed to be removed and used again on subsequent pitches, sometimes many times. Leaving gear in place went against the ethics of many climbers. John Salathé pioneered designs using hardened steel which were much tougher than the European pitons. Salathé&#x27;s pins, which he developed for a climb of the Lost Arrow, resisted deformation and were easier to remove and reuse, and were durable enough to be reused indefinitely.

==In popular culture==
===Films===
* In the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), James Bond (Roger Moore) makes use of pitons while climbing a sheer cliff face, as a means to infiltrate the villain Kristatos&#x27; (Julian Glover) hideout. Just before he gets to the top of the cliff, Bond is met by Apostis, one of Kristatos&#x27; assassins. Apostis tries to kill Bond by knocking his pitons out of the rock, which would cause Bond to fall to his death. Just before Apostis knocks out the last piton, Bond unclips another piton from his belt and uses it as a throwing knife, injuring Apostis and sending the assassin falling to his death. Bond is then able to infiltrate Kristatos&#x27; hideout.
* Piton guns, fictional, handheld devices that shoot pitons into walls, appear in the 2004 &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; as part of the equipment of Charles Bishop&#x27;s exploration team as they investigate what is revealed to be a pyramid where Predators breed and hunt Aliens. Team members use the guns to shoot pitons into the walls of the chasm being used to enter the pyramid, and after many of them are slaughtered in the central battle between the two species, the sole survivor, Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), uses one to kill an Alien while escaping back to the surface with the last surviving Predator, Scar, whom she allies with.
* In the movie &quot;The Descent&quot; (2005), a piton is discovered while exploring an unknown cave system. The women find and use it to cross a deep hole, but the last woman falls when the piton breaks from the ceiling. When the piton is retrieved, it is clearly shown around 45 minutes into the movie, and one woman explains that the piton is over 100 years old and not used any more in modern cave exploration.

===Games===
* In the video game &quot;I Am Alive&quot;, the main character can also use a piton to rest and replenish their stamina while climbing for extended periods of time.
* In &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&quot;, Nathan Drake acquires a piton from a hanged corpse. The tool becomes more used in the later half of the game. In &quot;&quot;, pitons left behind by enemy mercenaries are used by Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross.
* In the Hitman World Of Assassination Trilogy, a Piton can be used as a lethal weapon to stab targets, acquired by purchasing downloadable content.
* Pitons are a central mechanic of the 2023 climbing / puzzle platforming video game Jusant.
* In Firewatch, pitons are used by the main character Henry to descend a steep gravel incline. An incorrectly sunk piton is also the reason for Brian Goodwin&#x27;s death, according to his father, Ned.

===Literature===
* Dan Simmons&#x27; historical fiction novel, &quot;The Abominable&quot; (2013), centers on mountain climbing and frequently depicts passages in which piton use is crucial (e.g., Chapter 5). Additionally, the world-class British Alpinist, Richard Davis Deacon, sneers at the Germans&#x27; heavy use of such equipment, while the narrator, his younger American protégé, deems it brilliant (Chapter 6).

===Television===
* In the &quot;MacGyver&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Eagles&quot;, MacGyver must climb a mountain to save baby eagles. Short of equipment, he uses tent stakes as pitons.
* In &quot;The Alienist&quot; season 1 episode 4 (&quot;These Bloody Thoughts&quot;), the Jewish twins who work on the case discover a metal tool on the ground of the crime scene (the old immigration station, also known as the battery). One of the twins, Marcus, finds a piton on the ground, which was used by their suspect.

<text>Sottunga is an island municipality of Åland, an autonomous territory of Finland. The municipality is the smallest when it comes to population in Åland and in Finland, with a population of only 
() and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is
. The municipality is unilingually Swedish, with of the inhabitants speaking Swedish as their native language. Sottunga comprises many islands, of which only three, Husö, Finnö and Storsottunga, are inhabited. Storsottunga is usually called Sottunga. There are five villages in the municipality: Finnö, Husö, Hästö, Mosshaga and Sottunga. The highest point of Sottunga is Kasberget (25 m).

Sottunga can be reached by ferry from Långnäs in Lumparland and Galtby in Korpo and many ferries pass the island without making a stop.

==History==
Like the rest of Eastern Åland, Sottunga got its first permanent inhabitants sometime in the 11th century, although there is evidence that the island had had inhabitants long before that. The name &quot;Sottunga&quot; itself is thought to predate the 11th century. In the 17th century there were some ten households on the island and about 70 inhabitants.

Sottunga has suffered during many wars, first during the Great Northern War in 1714–22 when all of Åland fled to Sweden and again during the Finnish War of 1808-09 when all the buildings on the island were set on fire in order to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. In 1800, before the Finnish War, the island had been visited by King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Later during the Winter War of 1939–40 the island was bombed by the Soviet Union. The bombs were responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship SS &quot;Notung&quot; in 1940 just northeast of Sottunga.

The population of Sottunga reached its peak in the 1920s with about 400 inhabitants from which it has gradually declined during the 20th century.

==Economy==
Sottunga does not have many inhabitants and so the island has only one bank, one post office, one primary school and one healthcare center. Only is cultivated and commercial fishing is not practised anymore. The industry of the island is dominated by dairy products and the cultivation of sugar beet.

==Sights==
The church of Sottunga was originally built in 1661. The modern church on the site was built in 1728 after a fire had destroyed the original one. It is the smallest wooden church in Finland. Its clock tower was built in 1770 and the building was renovated in 1802. The painting at the altar was made by P. Berggren in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1845.

Before the church was built Sottunga had a chapel which was built in 1544 and which was approximately one kilometer away from the contemporary church.

On the island of Södö there are old mines dating back to the 19th century. Only 1,700 tons of iron ore were ever mined between the years 1839 and 1847 when the mines were operating.

<doc id="784506" wikidata="Q6982601" url="?curid=784506" title="Navy Arctic Service Ribbon">
<text>The Navy Arctic Service Ribbon is a decoration of the United States Navy which was established in May 1986. The ribbon is authorized to any member of the U.S. Navy or United States Marine Corps for service above the Arctic Circle. Like the Antarctica Service Medal, it may also be awarded to civilians and members of other U.S. services.

==History==

The ribbon was made retroactive to January 1982 and is also granted to members of other branches of the military, providing they are serving with a Navy or Marine Corps command when the Arctic duty was performed. The United States Coast Guard equivalent of the Arctic Service Ribbon is the Coast Guard Arctic Service Medal. On March 18, 2024 the Department of the Navy announced the establishment of the Navy Arctic Service Medal via Naval Message ALNAV 026/24.

==Criteria==

=== Navy Arctic Service Ribbon ===
Awarded to officers and enlisted personnel for twenty-eight days, consecutive or non-consecutive, above the Arctic Circle after 1 January 1982. For personnel working at remote ice camps or divers working under the ice, each day of duty will count as two days when determining award eligibility. No more than one day of credit can be counted for flights in or out during any 24-hour period. Marine Corps personnel undergoing annual cold weather training above the Arctic Circle do not qualify for 2 for 1 credit. The ribbon is issued for one time service only and there are no devices authorized for additional periods of Arctic service. The Antarctic equivalent of the Arctic Service Ribbon is the Antarctica Service Medal. The ribbon is worn after the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and before the Navy Reserve Sea Service Ribbon for Navy personnel. For Marine Corps personnel it is worn before the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon.

=== Navy Arctic Service Medal ===
Designed by the crew of the USS HARTFORD (SSN 768) during ICEX 2018 to recognize the unique sacrifices and circumstances involved in operating under ice for prolonged periods beyond those experienced by crews operating in arctic areas. Awarded as an extension of the Navy Arctic Service Ribbon to officers and enlisted personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps or civilians to units who conducted an ice-covered strait transit, a transit to the North Pole, assigned to a submarine that conducted a vertical surfacing through the ice, assigned to a submarine that conducted a seven day or more classified operation under the ice pack, or assigned to an ice camp or operations center.

<text>The National Library of Wales (), in Aberystwyth, is the national legal deposit library of Wales and is one of the Welsh Government sponsored bodies. It is the biggest library in Wales, holding over 6.5 million books and periodicals, and the largest collections of archives, portraits, maps, and photographic images in Wales. The Library is also home to the national collection of Welsh manuscripts, the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales, and the most comprehensive collection of paintings and topographical prints in Wales. As the primary research library and archive in Wales and one of the largest research libraries in the United Kingdom, the National Library is a member of Research Libraries UK (RLUK) and the Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL).

At the very core of the National Library of Wales is the mission to collect and preserve materials related to Wales and Welsh life and those which can be utilised by the people of Wales for study and research. Welsh is the Library&#x27;s main medium of communication, but it does aim to deliver all public services in Welsh and English.

== History ==

In 1873, a committee was set up to collect Welsh material and house it at University College, Aberystwyth. In 1905, the government promised money in its budget to establish a National Library and a National Museum of Wales, and the Privy Council appointed a committee to decide on the location of the two institutions. David Lloyd George, who later became Prime Minister, supported the effort to establish the National Library in Aberystwyth, which was selected as the location of the library after a bitter fight with Cardiff, partly because a collection was already available in the College. Sir John Williams, physician and book collector, had also said he would present his collection (in particular, the Peniarth collection of manuscripts) to the library if it were established in Aberystwyth. He also eventually gave £20,000 to build and establish the library. 

Cardiff was eventually selected as the location of the National Museum of Wales. Funds for both the National Library and the National Museum were contributed by the subscriptions of the working classes, which was unusual in the establishment of such institutions. In a Prefatory Note to &quot;A List of Subscribers to the Building Fund&quot; (1924), the first librarian, John Ballinger, estimates that there were almost 110,000 contributors. The Library and Museum were established by Royal Charter on 19 March 1907. The Charter stipulated that if the National Library of Wales should be removed from Aberystwyth then the manuscripts donated by Sir John Williams will become the property of the University College. A new Royal Charter was granted in 2006.

The National Library of Wales was granted the privilege of legal deposit under the Copyright Act 1911. Initially, however, the Library could only claim material deemed to be of Welsh and Celtic interest without any restrictions on expensive or limited edition publications. In 1987, the last of these restrictions were removed to make the legal deposit entitlement of the National Library of Wales equal to those of the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, Trinity College Library, Dublin and the National Library of Scotland.

The first use of the Library of Congress Classification by a library in Britain was at the National Library of Wales in 1913.

===Buildings===

On 15 July 1911 King George V and Queen Mary laid the foundation stone of the National Library of Wales. Designed by architect Sidney Greenslade, who won the competition to design the building in 1909, the building at Grogythan, off Penglais Hill, was ready for occupation in August 1915 but the task of transferring the collections was not completed until 1 March 1916, St David&#x27;s Day. The central block, or &quot;corps de logis&quot;, was added by Charles Holden to a modified version of Greenslade&#x27;s design. It was completed in 1937 and is a Grade II* listed building. The grounds (landscaping) of the National Library of Wales are also Grade II listed, and are seen as a significant part of the historical landscape of Wales with the landscaping both supporting, and playing a key part of the overall architectural design of the library building.

The Library is faced with Portland stone on the upper storeys which contrasts with the Cornish granite below it. Restoration work was necessary in 1969 and 1983 due to the effects of weathering on the Portland stone. In recent years many changes have been made to the front part of the building.

The large North Reading Room, where printed books are consulted, has &quot;the proportions of a Gothic Cathedral&quot;, being 175 feet long, 47 feet wide and 33 feet high. There are galleries at three levels above the floor. The feasibility of installing a mezzanine floor to make better use of the space has been considered on two occasions. Until 2022, The South Reading Room was used for consulting archives, manuscripts, maps and other printed materials. It now houses the Wales Broadcast Archive Centre, an Archive of programmes from all the major Welsh broadcasters dating back to the beginnings of broadcasting in Wales in the 1920s; this includes BBC Wales, ITV Wales and S4C. Carved above the entrance is the room&#x27;s original name the Print and Maps Room. Above it on the second floor of the south wing is the Gregynog Gallery where temporary and permanent exhibitions display the treasures of the Library&#x27;s collections.

A six-storey bookstack, which was completed in 1931, was built to increase storage space for the rapidly expanding book collection. A second bookstack was officially opened in March 1982. In 1996, the Third Library Building was opened, doubling the storage capacity of the Library. The second phase of the building was built by T. Alun Evans (Aberystwyth) Ltd.

A fire on 26 April 2013 destroyed a section of roofing in an office area of the building. Restoration was assisted by a government grant of £625,000.

===Wartime sanctuary===

During the Second World War, many of Britain&#x27;s most valuable artworks and manuscripts were stored in the National Library of Wales, which provided the evacuated treasures with a refuge from enemy bombing raids. The architect Charles Holden was instructed to design a tunnel for this purpose in the outcrop of rock close to the main building, with the British Museum sharing in the costs that this incurred. The tunnel was heated and ventilated to ensure the preservation of vellum, papyri and paper during its use from 18 July 1940 until 23 May 1945. In addition to an extensive consignment from the British Museum, which weighed over one hundred tons, the Library received forty-six boxes of manuscript and printed books from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and over a thousand pictures, eighty-two boxes of books and twenty members of staff from the National Gallery. The Library also received irreplaceable items from other prestigious institutions such as the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, Dulwich College and the Royal Society.

A number of distinguished scholars from the British Museum accompanied the collections to Aberystwyth. Their senior member of staff was Deputy Keeper of Printed Books, Victor Scholderer, who responded to a letter from the Director, Sir John Forsdyke, by insisting that he and his colleagues would continue to sleep in the Library so that the tunnel could be checked during the night to ensure that the air conditioning was functioning properly. Scholderer, an expert on incunabula, produced &quot;A Handlist of Incunabula in the National Library of Wales&quot; in gratitude to the hospitality that was afforded to them by the Library. Likewise, Arthur E. Popham, Keeper of Prints and Drawings, dedicated &quot;The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci&quot; &quot;To the Librarian and staff of the National Library of Wales&quot;. Several other institutions donated funds to the Library as an expression of their gratitude and Mrs. David Sassoon, London presented two works by Cicero that were printed at Venice in the fifteenth century.

The documents and artefacts that spent World War II in the care of the National Library include an original exemplification of Magna Carta, drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens and Velásquez from Dulwich College, letters of the kings and queens of England, and autographs belonging to William Shakespeare.

== Library collections ==
The collections of the National Library of Wales include over 6.5 million printed volumes, including the first book printed in Welsh, &quot;Yny lhyvyr hwnn&quot; (1546). In addition to the printed book collections, there are about 25,000 manuscripts in the holdings. The archival collections at the Library include the Welsh Political Archive and National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales. The Library also keeps maps, photographs, paintings, topographical and landscape prints, periodicals and newspapers. In 2010, the Peniarth Manuscript collection and &quot;The Life Story of David Lloyd George&quot; were amongst the first ten inscriptions on the UK Memory of the World Register, a UNESCO record of documentary heritage of cultural significance.

Collection development is focused on materials relating to the people of Wales, those in the Welsh language and resources for Celtic studies, but other materials are collected for the purposes of education and literary and scientific research. As a legal deposit library, the National Library is entitled to request a copy of every work published in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This has allowed the Library to collect modern Welsh, Irish and Gaelic language books for its Celtic collection. The acquisition of material through legal deposit has been supplemented by purchases, international exchanges, donations and bequests.

The Celtic collection includes works in all six Celtic languages. A representative collection of Scottish Gaelic books has been assembled, primarily through purchase of earlier publications, guided by the standard bibliographies, and, for books published after 1911, by legal deposit. Irish literature, which is far more extensive, has been collected through a similar combination of purchase and deposit. However, many collections purchased by or donated to the Library have contained rare Irish books. The Library of Dr E. C. Quiggin, which was received in 1921, contained a large Irish collection and many early Breton books. Further Breton books have been purchased or were acquired in the libraries of Sir Edward Anwyl, Thomas Powel, Dr Thomas Gwynn Jones, Dr Paul Diverres and Llywarch Reynolds. The holdings of Cornish and Manx printed books include practically everything that has been published in those languages, with a few facsimiles.

The Library&#x27;s holdings can also be found in the European Library and Copac union catalogues.

=== Manuscripts ===
The National Library of Wales keeps many rare and important manuscripts, including the Black Book of Carmarthen (the earliest surviving manuscript entirely in Welsh), the Book of Taliesin, the Hendregadredd Manuscript, and an early manuscript of Geoffrey Chaucer. Around three hundred medieval manuscripts are deposited in the Library: about 100 are in Welsh. The manuscript collection amalgamated a number of entire collections that were acquired in the early years of the Library&#x27;s existence, including the Hengwrt-Peniarth, Mostyn, Llanstephan, Panton, Cwrtmawr, Wrexham and Aberdare manuscripts. The Welsh manuscripts in these foundation collections were catalogued by Dr J. Gwenogvryn Evans in the &quot;Reports on manuscripts in the Welsh language&quot; that he compiled for the Historic Manuscripts Commission.

==== Peniarth Manuscripts ====
 

The Peniarth Manuscripts collection is considered to be of global significance and the most important collection of manuscripts in the National Library of Wales. In 2010, it was included in the UK Memory of the World Register of documentary heritage. Of the 561 volumes of manuscripts in the Peniarth collection, some four-fifths were collected by Robert Vaughan (c. 1592–1667) for his library in Hengwrt, Meirioneth. Three of the Four Ancient Books of Wales are part of the Peniarth collection, and this is indicative of the overall quality of the manuscripts and their importance as part of Welsh heritage. There are, however, also manuscripts in Cornish, Latin and English that are themselves noteworthy. The collection includes:
* The Black Book of Carmarthen (), the earliest manuscript in Welsh (Peniarth MS 1).
* The Book of Taliesin (c. 1350–1400) contains the oldest Welsh verse by the sixth-century poet Taliesin (Peniarth MS 2).
* The White Book of Rhydderch (), a composite volume that contains the earliest version of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; (Peniarth MS 4).
* The earliest fragments of &quot;Branwen and Manawydan&quot; and two fragments of &quot;Geraint ap Erbin&quot; comprise the four parts of Peniarth MS 6.
* &quot;Ystoryaeu Seint Greal&quot; (Tales of the Holy Grail), transcribed by Hywel Fychan around the year 1300, is the finest in a series of Romance manuscripts. A letter addressed to Lady Charlotte Guest concerning access to this text to have it copied is loose inside the volume (Peniarth MS 11).
* The &quot;Chronicle of the Princes&quot; in Peniarth MS 20 () is one of the two main versions of &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, the other being the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, which is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.
* &quot;History of the Kings&quot; (Peniarth MS 23C), is a copy of &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, the Welsh translation of the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is a rare instance of an illustrated medieval Welsh manuscript. 
* The Laws of Hywel Dda (c. 1300–1350), the earliest extant text (in Latin) of native Welsh law (Peniarth MS 28). More than 50% of the manuscripts known to contain the laws of Hywel Dda are in the collections of the National Library, with the majority being in the Peniarth Collection (see the list of Welsh Law manuscripts).
* &quot;Llyfr Du&#x27;r Waun&quot; (mid-13th century), also known as the Black Book of Chirk, the earliest Welsh text of the laws of Hywel Dda (Peniarth MS 29).
* Peniarth 32 is a 15th-century volume of the laws of Hywel Dda.
* The Peniarth 51 manuscript contains poetry, Welsh grammar, vocabularies, and historical triads that was written, mostly in the hand of Gwilym Tew, during the second half of the 15th century.
* &quot;Barddoniaeth Hywel Dafi&quot; (c. 1483–1500), a volume of poetry most by and possibly in the hand of Howel Davi. Other poets included in this volume are Bedo Brwynllys, Dafydd Llwyd, Llywelyn ap Morgan, Dafydd ap Gwilym and Ieuan ap Howel. The assumption that this manuscript was written by Howel Davi is challenged by evidence, such as slips of the pen that occur in poems of Davi&#x27;s composition, that suggest the scribe was copying these poems. With the exception of two sections (42 and 43), which are an attempt at transcription by an unskilled hand, the entire manuscript appears to be the work of one scribe (Peniarth MS 67).
* &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot; (The Life of St Meriasek) (1504), the earliest surviving manuscript in the Cornish language (Peniarth MS 105B). It is believed to have been completed in 1504 by Radolphus Ton, who was a canon during the final efflorescence of Cornish literature at Glasney College, Penryn. This play, which is set in Camborne, is a celebration of the life and work of St Meriasek that depicts the cultural links between Cornwall and Brittany. &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot; was rediscovered by W. W. E. Wynne in the 1860s among the volumes from the Hengwrt Library that had been bequeathed to him in 1859. It is the most important extant Cornish manuscript.
* &quot;Cywyddau&quot; and other poems, written in the hand of Lewys Glyn Cothi, comprise the manuscript Peniarth 109.
* &quot;Esboniadau ar Gyfraith Hywel Dda&quot; (Peniarth MS 164), is a volume of commentaries on the Laws of Hywel Dda from the early 15th century. 
* Peniarth Manuscript 259B is a version of the Laws of Hywel Dda from the mid-16th century.
* The Hengwrt Chaucer (c. 1400–1410), a folio volume of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, sometimes attributed to the scribe Adam Pinkhurst. One of the treasures of the National Library of Wales and by far the most important of the Peniarth Manuscripts in English (Peniarth MS 392D).
* The 15th-century volume comprising &quot;Disticha Catonis&quot;, the Battles of Alexander the Great, and History of the Three Kings (Peniarth 481D), and the late 15th-century &quot;Vaux Passional&quot; (Peniarth 482), which was prepared for Henry VII, were acquired and deposited in the National Library by Gwendoline and Margaret Davies in 1921. These two fine illuminated manuscripts were retained by W. R. M. Wynne when he sold the Peniarth Manuscripts to Sir John Williams.
* A bound volume containing books by Giovanni Battista Palatino and Ugo da Carpi, both notable Italian masters of the 16th century, which is assumed to have been owned by John Jones of Gellilyfdy (Peniarth MS 522). 
* Bede&#x27;s &quot;De natura rerum&quot; (12th century), a copy of the scientific treatise in Latin that is believed to have been written in Wales. Contains decorative initials, including three that have a zoomorphic design similar to those found in Irish manuscripts from this time (Peniarth MS 540B).
* Over forty manuscripts in the hand of John Jones of Gellilyfdy, embellished with initial capital letters and head- and tailpieces that demonstrate his calligraphic talent.

==== Llanstephan Manuscripts ====
The Llanstephan Collection of manuscripts was donated to the National Library of Wales by Sir John Williams in 1909. It had been his personal collection, which he kept in the library of his home, Llanstephan mansion, Carmarthenshire. The collection is composed of the 154 manuscripts which had belonged to Moses Williams (1685–1742), that were purchased from Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire and other manuscripts of diverse origins collected by Sir John. Medieval Welsh prose is well represented in the Shirburn Castle collection, with chronicles, legends, fables, theological tracts and collections of works by eminent poets of the period. These manuscripts include a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; from the 13th century, the Gutun Owain Manuscript and the Red Book of Talgarth.

==== Cwrtmawr Manuscripts ====

The Cwrtmawr Manuscripts are one of the significant manuscript collections that were transferred to the National Library of Wales in the early years of its existence. They are from the personal collection of John Humphreys Davies, who was the Principal of University College, Aberystwyth. Davies was a barrister and a keen book collector who acquired the manuscripts gradually from a number of sources. The largest group of manuscripts are those acquired from John Jones (&#x27;Myrddin Fardd&#x27;), but there are several other substantial groups including those from a Welsh clerical family, the Richards of Darowen, Peter Bailey Williams and his brother Rev. St George Armstrong Williams, William John Roberts (&#x27;Gwilym Cowlyd&#x27;), and Daniel Silvan Evans.

==== General Manuscript Collection ====

In addition to the Peniarth and Llanstephan manuscripts, the collection that Sir John Williams donated to the National Library included 500 manuscripts in the general collection (NLW MS 1–500). These manuscripts are an amalgamation of the various purchases that Sir John made between 1894 and 1899, including groups of manuscripts from the Welsh philologist Egerton Phillimore, Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, the Ashburn library and Sir Edmund Buckley of Plas Dinas Mawddwy. Descriptions of 446 of these manuscripts are provided by J. H. Davies in &quot;Additional Manuscripts in the Collections of Sir John Williams&quot;, which the Library published in 1921. The manuscripts in the National Library which are not part of the foundation collections are the focus of the &quot;Handlist of manuscripts&quot;, which was first published in 1941. All manuscripts acquired by donation or purchase are added to this open-ended series, either singly or in groups, if they are: a) in a format compatible with the collection, i.e. manuscript books or rolls, or unbound material that can be filed; and b) not integral to an archive or individual collection. There is, however, much archival material, most notably correspondence, held in the General Manuscript Collection. Individual manuscripts of particular interest include:

*A volume of medieval astronomy texts is the oldest scientific manuscript in the National Library (NLW MS 735C). The first section of the volume was written around 1000 and the second dates from . Both sections were copied in the Limousin region of France. The Latin text describes the constellations with the aid of diagrams and colour illustrations of Zodiac images.
*The Black Book of Basingwerk (NLW MS 7006D) is a 15th-century manuscript containing a version of &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Particular features of interest include the medieval wooden board binding and the decorated initials embellished with gold.
*The Llywarch Reynolds Manuscripts (NLW MS 970 to 997) are the 28 volumes that Llywarch Owain Reynolds bequeathed to the Library in 1916. The most notable among them is the 17th century collection of Welsh poetry, &quot;Llyuyr Hir Llywarch Reynolds&quot;.
*The Book of Llandaff (NLW MS 17110E), also known as &quot;Liber Landavensis&quot;, is an ecclesiastical manuscript written between 1120 and 1140.
*The Llanbeblig Book of Hours (NLW MS 17520A) is a small manuscript book compiled around 1390. The manuscript has a number of entries in the calendar that connect it to Wales, including a celebration of the dedication of the church of Saint Peblig, Caernarfon. Isabella Godynogh (d. 1413) was possibly its original owner. The full-page miniatures, illuminated with gold, and the fine lettering indicate the value of the book. The Llanbeblig Hours is the only known illuminated manuscript that contains the iconographical Lily Crucifixion motif, and may be the earliest example of its use in any media.
*NLW MS 20143A is a manuscript of the laws of Hywel Dda written in Welsh around 1350. It is unusual in that it retains a medieval binding. 
*The Tintern Abbey Bible (NLW MS 22631C) is a 13th-century Bible that has a known association with the medieval library of the Cistercian monastery at Tintern, Monmouthshire. It was purchased by the National Library for £30,000 in a Christie&#x27;s sale in December 1988 and is the second book known to have survived from the Tintern library. Under ultraviolet light the erased 15th-century inscription &quot;Ista biblia olim Abbathie de Tinternie&quot; (This Bible used to [belong to] Tintern Abbey) is visible to confirm the provenance of the manuscript.
*Beunans Ke (NLW MS 23849D) is a 16th-century Cornish manuscript discovered among the papers of Professor J. E. Caerwyn Williams after they were deposited in the National Library in 2000.

Groups of manuscripts in the general collection include:
=== Rare books ===
There are many rare books in the National Library of Wales including the three earliest books printed in Welsh, &quot;Yny lhyvyr hwnn&quot; (1546), Oll synnwyr pen Kembero ygyd (1547) and &quot;A Dictionary in Englyshe and Welshe&quot; (1547) by William Salesbury. The Library also holds the first Welsh translation of the complete Bible (1588). The National Library&#x27;s rare books include collections of incunabula, sixteenth-century European imprints, private press publications, bindings and scientific works.

Thanks to the collections of printed books that were donated by Sir John Williams, J. H. Davies and Edward Humphrey Owen, the Library has particularly strong holdings of publications in the Welsh language from before 1912. Of the 286 Welsh books published between 1546 and 1710, the National Library possesses copies of 210, and has facsimiles of others that exist as a unique copy in another institution.

Many of the named collections of printed books include early or otherwise rare books:
==== Sir John Williams Collection ====
The Sir John Williams Collection forms the nucleus of the Library&#x27;s printed books collection. The collection of approximately 23,360 volumes contains many items of importance to the history of Welsh printing, which were donated to the Library when it was established in 1907. Nineteen of the first twenty-two books published in Welsh are present, of which fourteen were acquired from the Shirburn Castle library with the Llanstephan Manuscripts. The collection from Shirburn Castle comprises 193 printed books and pamphlets that were all printed before 1750; a superb miscellany of books from the first century of Welsh printing. Some of the particularly significant items that belonged to Sir John are:

* [In this book ...] (1546) by Sir John Prise, the only known copy of the first book printed in Welsh.
* by Gruffudd Hiraethog (1547).
* William Salesbury&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary in Englyshe and Welshe&quot; (1547). 
* A translation of the New Testament by Salesbury (1567). The difficulty of reading Salesbury&#x27;s pedantic translation prompted William Morgan, vicar of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, to begin his translation of the Bible in 1578.
* Y Drych Cristianogawl [The Christian Mirror] (1586–7), probably the earliest book printed in Wales.
* The first Welsh translation of the complete Bible by William Morgan (1588). Morgan&#x27;s Bible not only strengthened the hold of the Protestant faith in Wales, it also created a new and accessible prose.
* John Penry&#x27;s pamphlet of 1588, &quot;An exhortation unto the governours.&quot;
* The Welsh translation of the first part of Canisius&#x27;s &quot;Opus catechisticum&quot; by Rosier Smyth, published in Paris, 1609. 
* &quot;Cân o senn iw hên Feistr Tobacco&quot; [A Diatribe against Tobacco] (1718), the only extant copy.
* Early editions of Morgan Llwyd, Robert Recorde, Henry and Thomas Vaughan, and the epigrammist John Owen.
* A comprehensive collection of publications from the Kelmscott Press.
* A 1488 edition of &quot;Lancelot du lac,&quot; part of a large Arthurian collection.
* A Fourth Folio of Shakespeare (1685).

==== Ty Coch Collection ====
Purchased in 1910, the library of Edward Humphrey Owen (1850–1904), from Ty Coch, Caernarfon, is the third of the National Library of Wales&#x27; foundation collections. The 3,680 volumes are mainly of Welsh interest, with the 1567 New Testament and 1588 Bible to be found among some twenty books from the sixteenth century. Other items of interest are a first edition of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise lost&quot; (1668), numerous first editions of John Ruskin and George Borrow, and books from the Baskerville and Strawberry Hill presses.

==== John Humphreys Davies Bequest ====
When John Humphreys Davies died on 10 August 1926 he bequeathed his collection of over 10,000 printed volumes to the National Library of Wales. Davies was a keen bibliographer who acquired multiple copies of some works for variants in the typography and accumulated an important collection of Welsh literature, discovering some previously unrecorded works in the process. Some of the early Welsh books that Davies collected contain leaves or signatures that were not in the copies that the National Library already possessed. The rare books include:
* &quot;Annerch ir Cymru&quot; (1721) by Ellis Pugh was the first Welsh book to be printed in America. 
* A complete first edition of part one of &quot;Aleluja, neu, Casgliad o hymnau, ar amryw ystyriaethau&quot; (1744) by William Williams of Pantycelyn.
* &quot;Testament Newydd&quot; (1567). 
* &quot;Y Bibl&quot; (1630).
* (1661), Ellis Lewis&#x27; Welsh translation, from the English translation by Winterton, of Jeremias Drexel&#x27;s &quot;De aeternitate considerationes.&quot;
* A previously unrecorded large paper issue of &quot;Y Bibl&quot; (1690).
* A copy of the 1688 edition of [Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress] is one of the seventy-three works by John Bunyan.
* Eighty-three volumes of the works of William Williams of Pantycelyn.

There are also substantial collections of pamphlets, elegies, almanacs, ballads, satires and tracts that Davies had collected.

==== Bourdillon Collection ====
In 1922 the National Library of Wales purchased the collection of French medieval literary texts and early illustrated books that had been assembled by Francis William Bourdillon (1852–1921). Bourdillon&#x27;s library included twenty-three editions of the &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot; and an important group of works on the Arthurian legend. The 6,178 printed volumes include sixty-six incunabula, 180 &quot;English short title catalogue&quot; books (1475–1800), including twenty-five &quot;STC&quot; and fifty &quot;Wing&quot; books. Further, there are 320 volumes that were printed in continental Europe during the sixteenth century, and another 260 items which date from the 17th and 18th centuries.

==== Incunabula ====
The National Library has a collection of about 250 incunabula, which are predominantly German, Italian and French imprints. Sixty-six of the incunabula, including seven different editions of the &quot;Roman de la Rose,&quot; with the accepted first edition among them, are part of Francis William Bourdillon&#x27;s collection that was purchased by the Library in 1922. At least three of the incunabula acquired from Bourdillon&#x27;s library are not known in any other copy: a &quot;Quatre fils Aymon&quot;, a &quot;Destruction de Jerusalem&quot;, and a &quot;Vie de Ste. Catherine&quot;. Sir Charles Thomas-Stanford presented or bequeathed eighteen incunabula in total, half of which were printed in Germany.

Three examples of early English printing were donated to the Library by Gwendoline and Margaret Davies of Gregynog in 1921. Two of these books were printed by William Caxton: &quot;Speculum Vitae Christi&quot; of 1488, and the copy of Ranulf Higden&#x27;s &quot;Polychronicon&quot; (1482) that had previously been the property of Higden&#x27;s Monastery, St. Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey at Chester. The third is another copy of the Polychronicon, printed by Caxton&#x27;s successor Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. Nine specimens of early printed books (three German, five Italian and one printed in Ghent) were deposited by Lord Harlech between 1938 and 1941. Other notable incunabula in the Library are the &quot;Astronomica&quot; by Marcus Manilius (1474) with illuminated initials and borders, and Hartmann Schedel&#x27;s &quot;Liber Chronicarum&quot; (1493).

During the time that the incunabula expert, Dr. Victor Scholderer, Deputy-Keeper in the Department of Printed Books at the British Museum, spent in Aberystwyth during the Second World War, he took an interest in the National Library&#x27;s small collection of fifteenth-century printed books and produced a &quot;Hand-list of incunabula&quot; that was published as a supplement to the &quot;National Library of Wales Journal.&quot; The hand-list and its addenda and corrigenda describes 129 books, mostly printed in Germany, Italy and France, although examples from the Netherlands and England were also listed. Scholderer noted that some of the forty-five books printed in France, particularly those in the vernacular, were very rare.

==== Sixteenth-century imprints ====
There are approximately 2,500 sixteenth-century European imprints in the Library. Works from the leading scholar-printers of the early sixteenth-century are represented in the collection, which covers a broad array of subjects. These include Johann Froben (Basle), Jodocus Badius (Lyons and Paris), Robert Estienne (Paris) and Aldus Manutius (Venice). Aldus Manutius of Venice, who is known for his dolphin and anchor printer&#x27;s device, was the finest of the Italian printers of this period and about a hundred examples of his works, known as Aldines, are in the National Library. The Library&#x27;s also owns works from the sixteenth-century Antwerp press of Christophe Plantin and his son-in-law, Balthasar Moretus, who published De Symbolis Heroicis (1634) with its title-page designed by Peter Paul Rubens. The collection of French medieval romances and editions of the &quot;Roman de la rose&quot; from the library of F. W. Bourdillon and the Aldines, which are from the collection of J. Burleigh James, are important features.

The National Library of Wales has one of the two copies of the 1539 edition of Miles Coverdale&#x27;s Great Bible, that were printed on vellum and illuminated throughout. The other copy is in the library of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==== Private presses ====
The Library has a substantial private press collection, some 1,800 volumes in total, with representative examples from all of the important British presses. The holdings of ordinary and special bindings of the Gregynog Press books are comprehensive and along with the reference collection from Gregynog, form the core of the National Library&#x27;s collection of private press editions. However, the Library also has a complete set of the Kelmscott Press publications that Sir John Williams collected, including &quot;The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; (1896). The private press collection has been developed through further acquisitions by donation, purchase and legal deposit, and contains examples of the productions by the Doves Press, Ashendene Press and the Roxburghe Club. Works from foreign presses have been collected and include many publications of the Grolier Club, the Bremer Presse edition of Luther&#x27;s Bible (1926–1928) and &quot;Eclogues&quot; of Virgil (1927) from the Cranach Press

==== Fine bindings ====
The National Library has many examples of books with fine bindings in its holdings. These include under-painted vellum, Victorian carved wood and papier-mâché bindings, French art nouveau bookbinding and bindings by Bernard C. Middleton and the Gregynog Press binder, George Fisher. In the late 1970s, the library acquired an archive recording the work of the Birdsall bindery, Northampton.

Bourdillon&#x27;s library includes books printed before 1600 in their original pigskin or stamped calf bindings and some examples of modern fine binding.

Examples of fore-edge paintings that depict topographical scenes in Wales have been collected by the National Library, including a view of Conway Castle and Bridge on a 1795 copy of &quot;The Poetical Works of John Cunningham&quot;, a rural view, stated to be Wales, painted on a 1795 edition of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; bound by Edwards of Halifax, and an 1823 English-Welsh bilingual edition of &quot;The Book of Common Prayer&quot; with a double fore-edge painting of (1) Bangor and (2) Bangor Cathedral. Other locations in Wales include Barmouth and Neath Abbey, both painted on books published during the nineteenth century. The earliest volume with a fore-edge painting owned by the Library is the 1669 Book of Common Prayer with a depiction of the Crucifixion.

==== The Euclid Collection ====
The National Library&#x27;s collection of works ascribed to Euclid contains more than 300 volumes, representing 270 editions, and is considered to be an important reference point for Euclidean bibliographical studies.
The collection has been developed through additions to the initial thirty-nine volumes of early editions of the &quot;Elements&quot; that Sir Charles Thomas-Stanford donated in 1927, including further eleven volumes from Sir Charles in 1928. With the subsequent additions the collection covers all of Euclid&#x27;s works, including &quot;Data, Phaenomena, Optica&quot; and &quot;Catoptrica&quot; along with numerous editions of the &quot;Elements,&quot; in many languages. There are two incunabula (Erhard Ratdolt, Venice, 1482 and Leonardus de Basilea &amp; Gulielmus de Papia, Vicenza, 1491) in the collection, as well as seventy-three volumes from the sixteenth century, including the first English (Reynold Wolfe, London, 1551) and Arabic (Typographia Medicea, Rome, 1594) editions.

=== Archives ===
The National Library of Wales is home to the largest collection of archival material in Wales. Around 2,500 archives of various sizes have been collected since the library was founded. These archives contain many different types of document, such as charters, estate records, correspondence, literary drafts and digital materials, which range from the medieval to contemporary periods. Many of the earlier archives are those of the landed gentry and their estates, which developed over many centuries, but these are supplemented by corporate archives including the Church of Wales archive and the archive of the Court of Great Sessions that the Library has received. The Library collects corporate archives, which are the records of institutions, societies and public bodies, and the personal archives of individuals who have played a significant role in the life of the nation. Personal archives contain a variety of material that is related to the life and work of notable individuals and families. For example, the papers of Celtic scholar Sir Idris Foster include correspondence, personal papers, scholarly and academic notes, and papers relating to organisations and societies, such as the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, the University of Wales and the Church in Wales.

==== The Welsh Political Archive ====
All materials concerning politics in Wales are kept in the Welsh Political Archive that the National Library established in 1983. This archive coordinates the collection of manuscript, printed and audiovisual records relating to the major political parties active in Wales, with the largest party archive being Plaid Cymru, and notable politicians including Lloyd George. The records of organisations including the Welsh National Council of the United Nations Association and the Association of Welsh Local Authorities also to be found in this archive, as are papers generated by the Parliament for Wales Campaign 1953–6, and several nationalist pressure groups.

Some of the political archives cannot be accessed due to their embargo status.

==== Modern Literary Archives ====
The Modern Literary Archives are home to the work of some of the most important Welsh poets and authors. An insight into the creation of prose and poetry is provided by the letters, manuscript and typescript drafts, notebooks, proofs and other personal papers of 20th and 21st century writers. Archives belonging to Welsh-language authors, Welsh authors writing in English and literary organisations are deposited in the National Library.

Papers and manuscripts belonging to Welsh authors who achieved their fame during the 20th century have been collected by the Library. The Archives of Welsh Authors include the work of authors, poets, playwrights, scholars, journalists and archdruids of the Gorsedd. Significant holding from these archives include draft copies of novels: &quot;Cysgod y Cryman&quot; [The Shadow of the Sickle] by Islwyn Ffowc Elis, &quot;Y Stafell Ddirgel&quot; [The Secret Room] by Marion Eames and &quot;Cyfres Rwdlan&quot; by Angharad Tomos; Saunders Lewis&#x27;s letters, and the correspondence between Rhydwen Williams and Alwyn D. Rees; the diaries of Caradog Prichard and Euros Bowen; and, manuscript copies of poetry, such as &quot;Y Mynach&quot; by Gwenallt, &quot;Y Mynydd&quot; by T. H. Parry-Williams and &quot;Cerddi&#x27;r Gaeaf&quot; by R. Williams Parry. Parry-Williams and Williams Parry were both first cousins of Thomas Parry, the National Librarian.

Dylan Thomas is the most prominent name amongst the Anglo-Welsh authors and the Library has a large collection of his papers. Other important items in the Archives of Welsh Writers in English are Raymond Williams&#x27; drafts of the novels &quot;Border Country&quot; and &quot;People of the Black Mountains&quot; and the papers of David Jones, which include draft copies of &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; and &quot;The Anathemata.&quot;

Prominent holdings in the Archives of Literary Organisations, Journals and Publishers are the National Eisteddfod of Wales, BBC Wales, the Welsh Arts Council and the Welsh Academy. The archive of the National Eisteddfod of Wales contains the central office records, compositions, adjudications and criticisms from 1886 onwards. The Eisteddfod is a unique institution and an important part of the literary tradition of Wales that celebrates poetry, song and the Welsh language. The substantial archive of BBC Wales includes radio drama scripts and talks by well-known authors. A further collection of Welsh authors archives is available in the papers of the Welsh Arts Council.

==== Screen and Sound Archive ====
The Screen and Sound Archive contains &quot;The Life Story of David Lloyd George&quot;, a 1918 biographical film, which is thought to be the first feature-length biopic of a living politician. It was included on the UK Memory of the World Register in 2010.

A 2001 documentary film, &quot;Against the Dying of the Light&quot;, was produced about the work of the Archive.

==== Penrice and Margam Estate Records ====
This extensive collection of estate and family records that was preserved at Penrice Castle in the possession of Miss Talbot of Margam contains manuscript material from the twelfth to nineteenth centuries. This includes the Margam Abbey archive which is one of the fullest surviving British monastic archives with charters from the period of the initial foundation of the Abbey at Pendar, its relocation to Margam, and the dissolution of the monastery.

Along with the manuscripts are numerous seal impressions which are themselves of historic importance. A collection of more than 30,000 seal impressions dating from the twelfth century onwards is preserved in the National Library of Wales, with examples including the seals of Welsh princes, ecclesiastic and papal seals, and in a variety of designs.

=== Pictures ===

The charter of the National Library of Wales states that pictures should be collected which portray places in Wales or people of Welsh background. Images in a number of different media are collected including paintings, drawings, prints and digital formats. The collection contains over 4000 framed paintings and drawings including paintings of Dolbadarn Castle and Aberdulais Mill by J. M. W. Turner and examples of the work of the landscape artist Richard Wilson, who influenced Turner, and Wilson&#x27;s pupil, Thomas Jones of Pencerrig.

A set of original drawings of Welsh scenes that Thomas Rowlandson made during his 1797 tour of Wales with Henry Wigstead, and a set of original drawings of castles, abbeys and cities by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck were donated by Sir John Williams. The Library also has some two hundred original watercolour drawings of Welsh landscapes by John Warwick Smith, and collections of original drawings of Welsh interest by Philip J. de Loutherbourg and S. H. Grimm. The collection of engraved prints illustrate a wide variety of Welsh topography and aspects of Welsh culture, and also show the development of the art of engraving. Every method of engraving is represented in the collection, which also contains examples of the work of famous engravers.

There are around 15,000 Welsh portraits in various media and a further 50,000 photographs and negatives in the Library&#x27;s collection. Portraits include the National Library&#x27;s main benefactors, Sir John Williams, Sir John Herbert Lewis, Lord Rendel, and Lord Davies of Llandinam; prominent Welsh individuals including David Lloyd George and Hwfa Môn; and, those by artists with a connection to Wales, such as Hugh Hughes, William Roos and Christopher Williams. Self-portraits by modern Welsh artists are also collected and include Keith Andrew, David Jones, Charles Tunnicliffe and Kyffin Williams. There are also many photographic portraits of Welsh individuals in the 1880s and 1890s that were taken by John Thomas.

There is a large collection of the work of Kyffin Williams in the Library, which includes his paintings of north Wales, sketches and watercolours of the Welsh colony in Patagonia and caricature portraits. Kyffin Williams bequeathed a significant part of his estate, including his own works and archives, to the National Library when he died in 2006.

=== Photographs ===

The Library holds a collection of more than 800,000 photographs, including the earliest-known photograph in Wales. The daguerreotype of Margam Castle, made by Reverend Calvert Richard Jones, dates from 1841. Many other examples of photography from the 1840s and 1850s, such as the early Swansea photography of the Dillwyn Llewelyn family, are kept in the National Collection of Welsh Photographs. This collection also contains mounted portraits by high-street photographers, topographic views and portraits by John Thomas and scenic postcard photography by Francis Frith that are connected to Wales.

During his career as a photojournalist, Geoff Charles produced a photographic archive that records life in Wales from the 1930s until the 1970s. The Geoff Charles Photographic Collection is the largest individual collection in the Library with 120,000 negatives. This unique contribution to Welsh photography is being preserved and digitised with sponsorship from the Big Lottery Fund.

=== Maps ===

There are over a million maps in the Library&#x27;s collections. There are maps on paper, parchment, cloth, wood, metal and digital media. These formats include a range of material such as globes, manuscript items, a 15th-century woodcut print, copper printing plates, carpet-sized map of Britain and Ordnance Survey digital data.

The Ordnance Survey Maps Collection includes near-to-complete coverage for Wales, beginning with photocopies of the Ordnance Surveyor&#x27;s drawings that formed the basis of the first edition of the one-inch-to-the-mile map which was published in 1818.

The collection of antiquarian printed mapping is substantial and includes examples of Humphrey Llwyd&#x27;s &quot;Cambriae typus&quot; (1574), the first printed map specifically of Wales, and the first county maps of Wales. In 2000, Peter Bellwood stole at least fifty antique maps from the Library, which were sold to private collectors for £70,000. Arrested in 2004, he was jailed for four and a half years.

A complete set of tithe maps, covering almost the whole of Wales, is housed in the National Library. The Welsh Church Commission Collection, which, in 1944, was deposited in the Library, includes the diocesan copies of the tithe maps that were transferred to the Commission in 1920 following the disestablishment of the Church of Wales. They are an important source for the study of mid-nineteenth century Wales and, therefore, are the most frequently used collection of maps and one of the most consulted categories of documents in the Library. The Cynefin Project is digitising over 1100 tithe maps and transcribing the appointment documents to link them together. The project is planned for completion in September 2016.

Other holdings in the maps collection include: manuscript estate maps, enclosure maps, estate sale catalogues, railway plans, architectural drawings, mining plans, and nautical and aeronautical charts.

== Publications ==
The National Library of Wales has published a series of books about its history and collections, including manuscript catalogues, a bibliography of Welsh publications, Parish Registers of Wales, and academic studies of Gwen John, Kyffin Williams and others. The Library also publishes the &quot;National Library of Wales Journal&quot;.

Between 1909 and 1984, the Library published &quot;Bibliotheca Celtica&quot; in fulfilment of the terms of its charter to keep a register of books printed in Welsh and other Celtic languages or relating to Wales and the Celtic nations. In 1985 &quot;Bibliotheca Celtica&quot; was merged with the &quot;Subject Index to Welsh Periodicals&quot; to form &quot;A Bibliography of Wales (Llyfryddiaeth Cymru)&quot;. In 1987, the retrospective bibliography &quot;Libri Walliae: a catalogue of Welsh books and books printed in Wales 1546–1820&quot; was published.

== Digital content ==

Many of the most important manuscripts and books at the Library have been digitised and made freely available to view on the library&#x27;s website in its &quot;Digital Mirror&quot;.

In April 2012, the Library made a policy decision not to claim ownership of copyright in digital reproductions. This meant that the rights information attached to digital representations of works would reflect the copyright status of the original (i.e., that originals in the public domain would remain in the public domain in their digital form). The Library has applied this policy to projects delivered since then (the Welsh Journals Online and Cymru1914) and is still in the process of updating rights information for its pre-2012 projects. Metadata are released into the public domain using the CC0 licence.

The Library has experience of sharing content from its collections under open content licences on platforms such as Wikipedia (e.g., the John Thomas photographic collection) and Flickr. In February 2013, the Library contributed 50 images relating to Monmouthshire to Wikipedia, a successful pilot project with Wikimedia UK. The following month, they became one of the cultural heritage organisations that partnered with Wikimedia Nederland, Wikimedia UK and Wikimedia France, together with Europeana, to be part of their collaboration to provide a set of tools to mass upload material from GLAM institutions to Wikimedia Commons. Also in 2013, the Library was awarded the Wikimedia UK &#x27;GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) of the Year Award&#x27;, for being &quot;a reliable supporter of the Wikimedia movement aims&quot;. By January 2016 almost 8,000 images had been made available for free download.

In January 2015, the Library, in partnership with Wikimedia UK, appointed a full-time Wikipedian in Residence with the aim of developing further its resources on an open licence for a worldwide audience.

The &quot;Cynefin: Mapping Wales&#x27; Sense of Place&quot; project has created a unified tithe map of Wales by digitising over a thousand tithe maps. Cynefin is a partnership between Archives Wales, the National Library of Wales and People&#x27;s Collection Wales that was launched in November 2014. A valuable online tool for historical research is being produced by crowdsourcing the contributions of volunteers through the Cynefin website to transcribe the apportionment documents and link them to the digitised tithe maps.

The Kyffin Williams Bequest Project was set up to catalogue and digitise the material that Kyffin Williams bequeathed to the National Library of Wales on his death in 2006. In addition to the collection of artwork, the bequest also included funds to cover this project. The cataloguing work began in 2008 and the digitisation started in 2009.

=== Welsh Journals Online ===
The National Library of Wales has digitised the back-numbers of 50 journals relating to Wales, in Welsh and English, in the Welsh Journals Online project funded by Jisc. It forms the largest body of Welsh text on the Web, and as well as allowing free access for all to scholarly articles on history, literature and science, and poems and book reviews. OCR of the page scans was undertaken to create TEI searchable text versions. The website contains a total of 400,000 pages. It is intended to add new issues of the titles as they emerge from the embargo period agreed with the publisher.

The fifty titles include:
=== Welsh Newspapers Online ===
 

Welsh Newspapers Online is an open access database of Welsh regional newspapers that has been created from the National Library of Wales&#x27; collection of historical newspapers. The database includes nearly 120 newspapers titles and provides access to over 1,100,000 pages from the years before 1919. Content relating to the First World War that has been digitised is also included in the database. The following publications are included:

<text>Sumiainen is a former municipality of Finland.

It is located in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Finland region. The municipality had a population of 1,293 (2003) and covered an area of 307.93 km2 of which 77.34 km2 is water. The population density was 5.6 inhabitants per km2.

Sumiainen consolidated to Äänekoski together with Suolahti in 2007.

The municipality was unilingually Finnish. The municipality was also known as &quot;Sumiais&quot; in Swedish. The Swedish name is now considered outdated according to the Institute for the Languages of Finland.

The river Kuokanjoki is located to the south of the village, and is one of the world&#x27;s shortest rivers.

== History ==
The toponym Sumiainen was first mentioned in 1442 as &quot;Sumiais&quot;, referring to the nearby lake. The settlement was established sometime in the 16th century, when it was a part of the Rautalampi parish. It became a part of the Laukaa parish after its establishment in 1628. Sumiainen was separated from Laukaa in 1868. It remained separate until 2007, when it was consolidated with Äänekoski together with Suolahti.

<doc id="784512" wikidata="Q6024707" url="?curid=784512" title="Indigenous peoples of Arizona">
<text>Indigenous peoples of Arizona are the Native American people who currently live or have historically lived in what is now the state of Arizona. There are 22 federally recognized tribes in Arizona, including 17 with reservations that lie entirely within its borders. Reservations make up over a quarter of the state&#x27;s land area. Arizona has the third largest Native American population of any U.S. state.

Archaeological evidence for the presence of Paleo-Indians in Arizona dates back at least 13,000 years. Over subsequent millennia, several complex and long-lived cultures emerged; these included the Hohokam, Mogollon, Sinagua, and Ancestral Puebloans, who are all thought to be ancestors of multiple modern tribes. The first Spanish settlers arrived in present-day Arizona in the mid-16th century, later establishing missions and drastically disrupting the indigenous way of life.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, present-day Arizona was ruled in turn by Spain, Mexico, and the United States. Settlers from all three nations encountered resistance from native Arizona communities, particularly the Apache. During 19th and 20th century American rule, Arizona Natives faced forced cultural assimilation under the boarding school system, environmental degradation on reservation lands, and, in some cases, ethnic cleansing.

In the 21st century, Arizona&#x27;s Native communities continue to play a prominent role in its culture, notably in its tourism industry. However, they also face systemic inequality, including a lack of water infrastructure and an increased susceptibility to health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===

Paleo-Indians are believed to have first settled present-day Arizona at least 13,000 years ago. Clovis spear points have been discovered in several locations along the San Pedro River, including at the Naco and Lehner Mammoth Kill Sites. Paleo-Indian peoples were hunter-gatherers who relied highly on North American megafauna for food. The following Archaic period saw these early cultures transition from specializing in big game to a more varied diet, including the advent of early agricultural practices. Archaic cultures identified in present-day Arizona include the San Dieguito complex, the Picosa and subsequent Oshara traditions, and the early Basketmakers.

Following the end of the Archaic period, several prominent cultures emerged in present-day Arizona, including the Hohokam, Mogollon, Sinagua, and Ancestral Puebloans. All of these peoples constructed pueblos, a type of monumental, multi-storied structure that could house as many as several thousand individuals. Several archaeological sites in Arizona that preserve pueblos include the Hohokam Casa Grande Ruins, the Sinagua Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot, and the Ancestral Puebloan structures of Wupatki National Monument. The Hohokam are also known for constructing an elaborate system of canals in what is now the Phoenix metropolitan area, which formed the foundation of the modern-day Salt River Project that provides water for much of Central Arizona.

During the 13th and 14th centuries CE, the Hohokam, Mogollon, Sinagua, and Ancestral Puebloan peoples all experienced a period of severe depopulation. While the precise causes of this are not definitively known, localized climate change, including severe drought and flooding, has been suggested as a driving factor, as has resource depletion and warfare with newly arrived groups in the region. This time saw the migration of the Athabaskan-speaking ancestors of the Navajo and Apache from the Rocky Mountains, as well as the ancestors of the Yavapai. By contrast, the Hohokam, Mogollon, Sinagua, and Ancestral Puebloans are thought to be ancestral to the modern-day Oʼodham, Hopi, and Zuni people, although this can be difficult to determine with certainty.

=== Spanish and Mexican colonization ===

The first Europeans to enter present-day Arizona were Marcos de Niza in 1539 and Francisco Vázquez de Coronado in 1540, both of whom encountered the Zuni and were met with resistance. In the second half of the 17th century, the Spanish Empire began widespread exploration of present-day Arizona, including the establishment of over twenty missions in the Pimería Alta by Eusebio Kino to introduce Christianity to the local Akimel and Tohono Oʼodham populations.

By the mid-18th century, decades of violence and forcible lifestyle changes from Spanish colonization led to discontent among the O&#x27;odham, who in 1751 ignited the Pima Revolt under the leadership of Luis Oacpicagigua. The late 18th century saw intense rebellion against Spanish rule by the Apache, particularly during the 1770s, which led to the expansion of presidios in present-day Arizona, including the Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón. In the late 1780s, the presidios began to hand out rations to the Apache, which reduced the scope of the conflict.

In 1821, the end of the Mexican War of Independence transferred control over present-day Arizona from the Spanish to the newly-established Mexican Empire, leading to the withdrawal of Spanish troops and the eventual abandonment of every mission but Mission San Xavier del Bac, near Tucson. The end of the Spanish policies that had led to relative peace with the Apache reignited the conflict, leading to decades of bloody Apache–Mexico Wars.

=== American Arizona ===

A majority of Arizona and a part of New Mexico became administered by the United States during the late 1840s as a result of the American victory in the Mexican–American War; the southernmost portion of the state, including Tucson, was purchased by the U.S. in 1854. Soon after establishing control over the area, the United States government constructed a series of military forts to enforce its authority over the Native population; the first of these, Fort Defiance, was established in Navajo territory in 1851. After a series of conflicts, including the 1860 Second Battle of Fort Defiance, the military commander of New Mexico Territory, James H. Carleton, and Col. Kit Carson launched a relentless campaign against the Navajo. Upon their surrender in 1864, they, along with the Mescalero Apache, were forced to migrate from their land in present-day Arizona to internment camps at Fort Sumner/Bosque Redondo, in an act of ethnic cleansing that would become known as the Long Walk. It is estimated that hundreds of Navajo died during the migration itself, and upward of 2,000 died due to poor conditions at Bosque Redondo. The Army&#x27;s difficulties in managing the reservation led them to negotiate the 1868 Treaty of Bosque Redondo with the Navajo, which allowed them to return to their land in exchange for establishing a separate reservation there.

The U.S. government also engaged in a series of conflicts with the Apache. Lasting for nearly forty years between 1849 and 1886, the Apache Wars remain the longest armed conflict in U.S. history. Though conflict had erupted earlier in New Mexico, fighting in present-day Arizona was sparked by the 1861 Bascom affair. U.S. campaigns against the Apache, as well as the Yavapai, continued for decades; they were particularly intense following the end of the Civil War, when up to a quarter of all U.S. troops were stationed in the Southwest. The Tohono O&#x27;odham, who had themselves been hostile with the Apache since at least the late seventeenth century, were occasional allies for the Americans, such as in 1871, when a coalition of O&#x27;odham and American settlers conducted a massacre of 144 Apaches at Camp Grant. The formal end of the Apache Wars is not clearly defined; while 1886, which saw the Apache leader Geronimo surrender to the Americans and many Chiricahua Apache deported to Florida, is often cited, sporadic fighting continued until the early 20th century.

In addition to direct conflicts, other aspects of the United States&#x27; policy toward Native peoples profoundly affected Arizona Natives&#x27; way of life. The establishment of reservations, beginning with the Gila River Indian Community in 1859, sometimes involved the resettlement of indigenous groups away from their traditional land. The second half of the 19th century also saw the establishment of the American Indian boarding school system, including the Phoenix Indian School, founded in 1891. Intended to forcibly assimilate Arizona Native children into American culture, school policies prohibited the use of native languages and clothing and separated children from the same tribe. Although the curriculum underwent heavy reform during the 1930s at the behest of reformist Bureau of Indian Affairs chief John Collier, the school remained open until 1990.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
Around the turn of the 20th century, brutal oppression during the Mexican Yaqui Wars drove many Yaquis to flee north to Arizona, becoming the Pascua Yaqui Tribe; by 1940, Arizona was home to around 2,500 Yaquis. Despite this, the Pascua Yaquis were not recognized by the United States government until 1978, when the Pascua Yaqui Reservation was established on the outskirts of Tucson. It is the most recent reservation to be established entirely within Arizona.

The 20th century also saw an increasingly strong movement for self-determination among Arizona Natives, particularly the Navajo. During the construction of the Hoover Dam, John Collier and the U.S. government, believing that Navajo agriculture was causing environmental damage to the area, forced farmers to cull their livestock; the resulting economic impact led the Navajo to engage in organized political resistance and more robust self-governance, a process which accelerated further after World War II. Some Arizona tribes have also engaged in language revitalization initiatives by incorporating indigenous languages into schooling, although state educational standards have at times come into conflict with these programs.

Following the passage of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which established a regulatory structure for Native American gaming in the United States, many Arizona Native tribes have turned to casinos as a source of income. Although only around forty percent of tribes nationwide operate gaming facilities, that proportion is much higher in Arizona, with sixteen of twenty-two recognized tribes being involved in gaming. Native-run casinos, along with sites on tribal land, museums, and cultural festivals, have become an important contributor to Arizona&#x27;s tourism industry in the 21st century.

Native Americans in contemporary Arizona continue to face systemic inequality, compounded by a lack of critical infrastructure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, indigenous peoples, particularly on tribal land, faced disproportionately higher rates of illness. In the Navajo Nation, by far the largest reservation in Arizona, 36% of residents live below the poverty line, 35% of residents lack running water, and thousands of residents lack electricity. Issues of water access have been compounded in recent years by droughts affecting the Colorado River; moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Arizona v. Navajo Nation&quot; (2023) that the U.S. government has no obligation under the Treaty of Bosque Redondo to supply water to the Navajo.

== Reservations ==
The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, headquartered in Tuba City, is federally recognized, but it does not currently have a reservation.

== Languages ==
The indigenous peoples of Arizona speak a variety of languages from several different language families. Speakers of Yuman–Cochimí languages include the Havasupai, Hualapai, Yavapai, Mohave, Halchidhoma, Quechan, Maricopa (Piipaash), and Cocopah. The Navajo and Apache are Southern Athabaskan-speaking people who migrated into the American Southwest from the north, possibly around 1300 CE. Apache bands connected to Arizona include the Tonto Apache, Chiricahua, San Carlos Apache, and White Mountain Apache. The Southern Paiute, including the Chemehuevi, speak the Colorado River Numic language, a Uto-Aztecan language; other Uto-Aztecan speakers include the Hopi, O&#x27;odham, and Pascua Yaqui. The Hopi-Tewa speak both Hopi and the Tanoan Tewa language.

The Zuni speak a language isolate. Various theories for relationships between the Zuni language and other languages have been proposed, but none of these have been widely accepted by researchers.

<text>The National Library of Scotland (NLS; ; ) is one of the country&#x27;s National Collections. It is one of the largest libraries in the United Kingdom. As well as a public programme of exhibitions, events, workshops, and tours, the National Library of Scotland has reading rooms where visitors can access the collections. It is the legal deposit library of Scotland and is a member of Research Libraries UK (RLUK) and the Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL).

There are over 24 million items held at the Library in various formats including books, annotated manuscripts and first-drafts, postcards, photographs, and newspapers. The library is also home to Scotland&#x27;s Moving Image Archive, a collection of over 46,000 videos and films. Notable items amongst the collection include copies of the Gutenberg Bible, Charles Darwin&#x27;s letter with which he submitted the manuscript of &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; the First Folio of Shakespeare, the Glenriddell Manuscripts, and the last letter written by Mary Queen of Scots. It has the largest collection of Scottish Gaelic material of any library in the world.

== Buildings ==
The Library&#x27;s main public building is in Edinburgh city centre on George IV Bridge, between the Old Town and the university quarter. This building is Category A listed. Exhibitions are frequently held here, with past examples including &#x27;Northern Lights: The Scottish Enlightenment&#x27; (21 June 2019 – 18 April 2020), a display which explored Scotland&#x27;s contribution to the progress of Enlightenment, and &#x27;The International Style of Muriel Spark&#x27; (8 December 2017 – 13 May 2018), a celebration of her life and literary achievements.

As the library is a not a lending library, this building is one of several venues where the public are able to visit and consult primary materials in the reading rooms. There are two reading rooms in the George IV building, and a third Multimedia Room for consulting non-written materials:

* General Reading Room – a space for people to conduct research using materials like journals, newspapers and newer, post-1850 books.
* Special Collections Reading Room – a room where the public are able to access old and rare materials, such as rare books and manuscripts.
* Multimedia Room – a space to consult non-written materials, such as microforms and photographs.

There is also a more modern building, constructed in the 1980s, in a residential area on the south side of the town centre, on Causewayside. This was built to accommodate some of the specialist collections, such as maps and science collections, and to provide extra large-scale storage. There is one reading room located here also; the Maps Reading Room, purposed for visitors to consult maps, atlases, gazetteers, and cartographic reference books.

The newest addition to the Library is the 2016 Kelvin Hall public centre in Glasgow, purposed to provide access to the library&#x27;s digital and moving collections, namely the Moving Image Archive. Like at the library&#x27;s main building, exhibits are held here too, though on a smaller scale.

==History==
Originally, Scotland&#x27;s national deposit library was the Advocates Library belonging to the Faculty of Advocates. It was opened in 1689 and gained national library status in the Copyright Act 1710 (8 Ann. c. 21), giving it the legal right to a copy of every book published in Great Britain. In the following centuries, the library added books and manuscripts to the collections by purchase as well as legal deposit, creating a privately-funded national library in all but name.
By the 1920s, the upkeep of collection was too much for the Advocates Library and, with the aid of a £100,000 endowment from Alexander Grant, managing director of McVitie &amp; Price, the library&#x27;s contents were presented to the nation. The National Library of Scotland was formally constituted by the (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 73).

Grant&#x27;s support was recognised with a baronetcy, and in June 1924 he became Sir Alexander Grant of Forres. In 1928 he donated a further £100,000 – making his combined donations the equivalent of around £6 million today – for a new library building to be constructed on George IV Bridge, replacing the Victorian-period Sheriff Court, which moved to the Royal Mile. Government funding was secured which matched Grant&#x27;s donation. Work on the new building was started in 1938, interrupted by World War II, and completed in 1956. The architect was Reginald Fairlie; the architectural sculptor was Hew Lorimer. The coat of arms above the entrance was sculpted by Scott Sutherland and the roundels above the muses on the front facade by Elizabeth Dempster.

By the 1970s, room for the growing collections was running out, and other premises were required. The Causewayside Building opened in the south-side of Edinburgh in two phases, in 1989 and in 1995, at a total cost of almost £50 million, providing additional working space and storage facilities.

Since 1999, the library has been funded by the Scottish Parliament. It remains one of six legal deposit libraries in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is overseen by a board of trustees.

The library also holds many ancient family manuscripts including those of the Clan Sinclair, which date back to 1488.

On 26 February 2009, areas of the building were flooded after a water main burst on the 12th floor. Firefighters were called and the leaking water was stopped within ten minutes. A number of items were lightly damaged.

The last letter written by Mary Queen of Scots made a rare public appearance to mark the opening of a new library visitor centre in September 2009.

The library joined the 10:10 project in 2010 in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. One year later they announced that they had reduced their carbon emissions according to 10:10&#x27;s criteria by 18%.

On 16 May 2012 the (asp 3) was passed by the Scottish Parliament, and received royal assent on 21 June 2012.

In April 2013 the library recruited a Wikipedian in residence, becoming the first institution in the Scotland to create such a post. In 2016, the library recruited a Gaelic Wikipedian in residence.

In September 2016 the library opened a new centre at the refurbished Kelvin Hall, Glasgow, in partnership with Glasgow Life and the University of Glasgow, providing access to the library&#x27;s digital and moving image collections.

==Archives and collections==
The National Library of Scotland has many different collections in varying sizes, though some of the larger ones (with in-depth pages of their own) are listed here:

=== John Murray Archive ===

The John Murray Archive is one of the larger collections at the National Library of Scotland, consisting of over one million items. It contains various documents, letters, manuscripts, and business papers all related to the House of John Murray, a British publisher known for publishing the likes of Jane Austen, Herman Melville, Charles Darwin, and Lord Byron. Also included within the collection is the Archive of Smith, Elder and Company, as well as the Charles Elliot papers. The Library continues to receive additions to the archive on an ad hoc basis.
=== India papers ===

There are over 4,200 bound volumes (40,000 individual reports) within the India Papers collection. The archive consists of reports, photographs, government correspondence, and various other miscellaneous material related to the British Raj. The collection is rare and is the largest of its kind in the UK behind the India Office Records at the British Library. It contains items related to medicine, travel, the arts, human rights, and military history, as well as many others. One of the bigger sections, the Medical History of British India, has been digitised and is available to the public online. One of the highlights from the collection is the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report.

=== Minto papers ===

The Minto Papers are over 2,000 documents relating to the Elliot family, a British family of aristocrats founded in the 17th century. This collection is a valuable source of study for British politics, Scottish history, and the affairs of 19th-century Canada, Italy, and British India.

=== Patrick Leigh Fermor archive ===

The Patrick Leigh Fermor Archive is a collection of different items related to Patrick &#x27;Paddy&#x27; Leigh Fermor, a British travel writer, adventurer, and veteran. The Archive was purchased by the Library in 2012 from Fermor&#x27;s estate, using funds from the John R. Murray charitable trust. There are over 10,000 items in the collection including photographs, sketches, films, war reports, books, manuscripts, and postcards.

=== Moving Image Archive ===

The Moving Image Archive is a collection of over 46,000 moving images (films, television shows, and short video clips). The Library acquired the collection as the Scottish Screen Archive in 2007, though it was renamed in 2015. Over 2,600 items from the collection have been put online and are freely available to the public for viewing in the venue at Kelvin Hall.

=== Lord Hope&#x27;s Historical Archive ===
Lord Hope in November 2014 donated legal and personal papers including opinions covering the period of his active legal career.

== Maps ==

The National Library of Scotland holds over two million cartographic items, making it the largest collection of maps in Scotland and one of the largest in the world. There are several separate collections of maps within the library&#x27;s holdings, namely the Bartholomew Archive and the Graham Brown Collection (see below). At the library there are maps relating to many different kinds of landscapes, such as estates, counties, railways, maps which show the trenches of World War I, and alpine areas.

The collections include:

* Over 1.5 million sheet maps
* 15,000 atlases
* 100,000 maps on microfilm
* Over 200,000 digital maps
* Gazetteers, cartographic reference books and periodicals
* Map ephemera
=== Bartholomew Archive ===

The Bartholomew Archive is a notable map collection that was gifted to the Library in 1995 by the Bartholomew family in memory of Scottish cartographer John Bartholomew (1890–1962). The archive provides information about the Edinburgh-based firm of map engravers, printers, and publishers, John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. It is one of the most extensive cartographic archives available for research in a public institution.

=== Board of Ordnance collection ===

The Library holds roughly 375 military maps and plans that were prepared by the Board of Ordnance in the 18th century for government troops during the Jacobite period. Within the collection are maps of routes, fortifications, and Highland towns. The items in the collections were donated to the library in the 1930s by a government department descended from the Board.

=== Stevenson collection ===
The Stevenson Collection is a collection of 19th and 20th century manuscript and printed maps, drawings, and building plans from the Stevenson family, a Scottish engineering family specialising in building lighthouses, harbours, and other civil engineering works. The collection mostly covers their work in the United Kingdom, although there are some works concerning Japan and New Zealand, and several other countries.

== Acquisitions related to the theatre ==
The National Library of Scotland holds materials related to (primarily) Scottish theatre, though many of the individual notable items are found across different collections. It has a wide range of theatre materials, including scripts and manuscripts, business papers, sets, theatre programmes, and photographs.

=== 20th and 21st century theatre ===
Many of the theatre-related items from the 20th and 21st century are held by the Library. These include plays and unpublished manuscripts; music hall and pantomime material; posters, playbills and programmes; reviews and news cuttings; theatre company archives; and material from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The general public are able (and encouraged) to view these items at the Special Collections Reading Room in the library&#x27;s main building, a space where people can consult rare books, manuscripts, and music. Theatre of the 20th century is also well represented on film and can be viewed by the public at the library&#x27;s Moving Image Archive.

==== The Set of &quot;The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black, Black Oil&quot; ====
&quot;The Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black, Black Oil&quot; is a Scottish play by playwright John McGrath. The play tells the history of economic change and exploitation in the Scottish Highlands, from the Highland Clearances all the way through to the contemporary oil boom at the time of its initial production. The stage set for the play, designed and painted by Scottish artist John Byrne, was made in 1973 and is in the form of a giant-sized pop-up book. The Library acquired the set in 2009, although it is currently on loan to V&amp;A Dundee and is on display at the museum until 2043 as part of a 25-year loan agreement with the NLS.

Measuring over 4 metres in length when opened and over 2 metres tall, the &quot;Cheviot&quot; set is the largest book at the National Library of Scotland. It consists of 5 different scenes painted by Byrne, including: a Highland landscape, a croft house, a poppy-covered war memorial, and a Native American Tipi. The physical set is made from cardboard, however it has been digitised in 3D by the NLS, meaning it can be viewed online via the Cheviot 3D section on the NLS website while it is on loan.
=== Pre-20th century theatre ===
The library holds various items of early modern and restoration English drama, mainly within the Bute Collection. Notable items that can be found here include early editions of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, namely &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, Hamlet&quot;, and &quot;Othello.&quot; The Bute Collection hosts other Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline dramatists as well, namely George Chapman, Thomas Dekker (including an intact copy of the Converted Curtezan of 1604), John Lyly, Philip Massinger, Thomas Middleton, and John Webster.

==== 18th century items ====
Although Scotland&#x27;s first public theatre did not open until 1736, plays were performed at alternative venues like schools, courts, and local festivals. The collections at the National Library of Scotland include early editions several Scottish plays, printed before 1736, that would have been performed like this.

Also held at the NLS are a small number of early editions of &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; (1725) by Scottish poet Allan Ramsay which was turned into a ballad opera and became a favourite of the Scottish stage.

==== 19th century items ====
There is a large collection of Edinburgh Theatre Royal playbills at the library, advertising performances and events from 1807 to 1851. The library also holds a few texts of stage adaptations of the novels of Sir Walter Scott. As well as this, the NLS has books from the lawyer and author Sir Theodore Martin, which mainly relate to his wife, actress Helena Faucit.

The Weir Collection is one of the biggest resources at the National Library of Scotland for 19th century materials related to the theatre. The collection is an Archive of over 500 19th-century playbills, posters, programmes, photographs and newspaper cuttings, presented to the library in 1970 by Kathleen Weir, who inherited them from her father, James J. Weir. One of the earliest playbills in the collection advertises a performance of Rob Roy on 11 March 1829 with Charles Mackay playing Bailie Nicol Jarvie. Particularly attractive are the examples of the pictorial posters of the later part of the 19th century, featuring scenes from plays or portraits of the leading actors and actresses.

== Mountaineering and polar collections ==
The NLS has obtained three substantial collections which make it an important hub for the study of mountains, mountaineering, and the polar regions. Climbing is the central focus of the library&#x27;s mountaineering collections, though materials related to ecology, hillwalking, mountains in art and literature, and geology also make up a large part of them. The Alps and the Himalayas receive the most coverage throughout the collections, and the discovery and exploration of the Arctic and Antarctica are heavily featured also.

=== Graham Brown collection ===

The Graham Brown collection was acquired by the library in 1961 via the bequest of physiologist Professor Thomas Graham Brown. There are over 20,000 items within the collection, including written works related to the history of Alpine climbing, books on Arctic exploration, mountaineering journals, over 250 press cuttings, postcards, manuscripts, and photographs. Much of the material within the collection is personal; there are Brown&#x27;s climbing diary notebooks, papers related to his time as an editor of the Alpine Journal, correspondence, and his book &quot;The First Ascent of Mont Blanc&quot; (1957). The Graham Brown Collection also contains a large number of 19th and 20th century maps, many of them Swiss, French, and Italian – the earliest of these is a 1783 map of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Additions to the collection continue on an ad hoc basis. 
==== Graham Brown Research Fellowship ====
The Graham Brown Research Fellowship was initiated in 2018 and supports a three-month period of research for fellows to explore any aspect of mountaineering, including literature, history, and environment. The first National Library of Scotland Graham Brown Research Fellow was Alex Boyd FRSA, an artist, photographer, and curator. He focussed on the cultural and literary significance of mountains in Scotland.

=== Lloyd collection ===
The Lloyd Archive consists primarily of books and journals on the Alps and was bequeathed by former Vice-President of the Alpine Club, Robert Wylie Lloyd. Lloyd was interested in entomology and collecting art. There are roughly 2000 items in the collection and many of them in English, although there are 300 in French, over 100 in German, 20 in Italian, and some works in Latin. Books in the collection that were published before the middle of the 1700s are concerned with the history and topography of Switzerland, whilst the works from later in the century are more related to the natural history, geography and geology of the country. Also included within the Lloyd collection are guidebooks on Switzerland and illustrated journals of Alpine tours.

=== Wordie collection ===
The Wordie collection consists of works on Arctic and Antarctic exploration and was formed by Sir James Mann Wordie, a British explorer and scholar. The library obtained the collection in 1959, containing nearly 5000 items including books, journals, pamphlets, maps, and correspondence. The collection includes not only technical reports of scientific expeditions, and the results of polar research, but also popular accounts of travel and exploration, whale-fishing and folklore. The oldest item in the collection is the second edition of &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimage&quot; (1614).

== Official publications ==
The National Library of Scotland has an extensive collection of official material as a result of the 1710 Copyright Act and also because of the library&#x27;s status the library of the Faculty of Advocates. The official publications at the library consist largely of documents relating to Westminster Parliament and other UK government bodies, like the Scottish Parliament, though the NLS does also receive materials from overseas, including the United States and the Commonwealth. The India Papers are a prime example of a substantial collection of official publications.

=== Scottish Parliament ===
The Library holds various documents and publications relating to Scottish Parliament including the proceedings from the first surviving Act of Parliament in 1235. All Acts of Parliament are deposited at the Library as a result of the 1925 National Library of Scotland Act, and the public may consult the material in the reading rooms at the library&#x27;s main building. Also held at the library are various business publications of Scottish Parliament, available in print to consult physically at the library are those dated up to September 2015. Publications dated after September 2015 can be viewed digitally.

=== UK Parliament ===
The Library holds a comprehensive collection of the publications of the UK Parliament from the 19th century to the present day. The Library holds copies of the House of Lords Journal, which dates from 1509 to the present day and is the Library&#x27;s oldest currently published periodical. The journal records the proceedings of the House of Lords. The Library, in partnership with ProQuest and the House of Lords digitised 3,000 volumes of material related to the House of Lords.

=== United States ===
From 1950 to 1994, the Library received, under an exchange arrangement with the Library of Congress, a collection of US federal government information. Over that period the Library received approximately 10% of the United States monthly output of official publications. The collection has not yet been completed, and much if it is uncatalogued.

<text>Albert Cameron Hunt (3 April 1857 – 2 October 1915) was an American electrician who invented the wigwag, a grade crossing signal used in transportation. Hunt was a mechanical engineer from Southern California. He invented the wigwag in the early 1900s out of the necessity for a safer railroad grade crossing. Hunt was associated with the Pacific Electric interurban streetcar railroad.

Hunt was born in Freeport, Illinois, the son of Alexander Cameron Hunt, governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1867–69, and Ellen Kellogg. He died of neurosyphilis in 1915.

<text>Stephen Russell (born 1937), also nicknamed &quot;Slug&quot;, is an American computer scientist most famous for creating &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, well known for being the first widely distributed video game.

==Biography==
Born in Hartford, Connecticut, Russell attended Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, from 1954 to 1958.

Russell wrote the first two implementations of the programming language Lisp for the IBM 704 mainframe computer. It was Russell who realized that the concept of universal functions could be applied to the language. By implementing the Lisp universal evaluator in a lower-level language, it became possible to create the Lisp interpreter; prior development work on the language had focused on compiling the language. He invented the continuation to solve a double recursion problem for one of the users of his Lisp implementation.

In 1962, Russell created and designed &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, with the fellow members of the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 minicomputer. &quot;Spacewar!&quot; is widely considered to be the first digital video game and served as a foundation for the entire video game industry.

He later served as an executive of Computer Center Corporation (nicknamed C-Cubed), a small time-sharing company in Washington (state). In 1968, he mentored Bill Gates and Paul Allen on the use of the DEC PDP-10 mainframe, while they were part of the programming group of Lakeside School (Seattle).

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

==History==
Suonenjoki is thought to have served as a milestone in the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323. In the 16th and 17th centuries, more and more people began to settle in the area, and in the 18th century, a preacher room was established in Suonenjoki, then a chapel. In the current agglomeration, bridges over the river of Suonenjoki were built early, &quot;Kruunusilta&quot; (literally means &quot;Crowns Bridge&quot;) already existed in 1780, and &quot;Siioninsilta&quot; (means &quot;Zion Bridge&quot;) at the beginning of the river was replaced by a bridge in the 1830s.

When Suonenjoki gained municipal rights in 1865, the population was about 4,000. In the same year, Suonenjoki Church, the current church in Suonenjoki was completed, replacing the cramped first church built in the late 18th century. A railway station was built on Suonenjoki in connection with the completion of &quot;The Savonian Railway&quot; (also known as Kouvola–Iisalmi railway) in 1889. In the early 20th century, the sawmill industry became the most important industry in the area. Strawberry cultivation became more widespread from the 1940s, and Suonenjoki became known as &quot;the Strawberry Town&quot;. The Suonenjoki co-educational school began operations in 1930, moving to its current high school building in 1950.

==Geography==
The neighbouring municipalities of Suonenjoki are Rautalampi to the west, Tervo to the northwest, Kuopio to the north, Leppävirta to the east, and Pieksämäki to the south on the Southern Savonia side. Suonenjoki River flows through the town from Lake Suontee to Lake Iisvesi. Near the city center is the 10-kilometer-long and at most a couple of kilometers wide scenic Lintharju, which is also part of the European Union&#x27;s Natura 2000 conservation program.

Sysmä was a large parish, though most of its northern lands lacked a permanent population. The northern parts were eventually settled by Savonians and in 1561, the area became the Rautalampi parish which included most of modern Central Finland north of the Päijänne; from Toivakka to Pihtipudas.

The original dialect spoken in Sysmä was a Tavastian dialect. It was replaced by a Savonian dialect soon after Ivar Tawast killed 400 peasants from Sysmä, Jämsä and Kuhmoinen in Padasjoki during the Cudgel War. Many farms in Sysmä were left without owners, so they were taken by Savonian settlers.

Sysmä was also occasionally known in documents as &quot;Sysmäki&quot; due to association with the word &quot;mäki&quot; (hill), compare Kärsämäki which used to be &quot;Kärsämä&quot;.

Hartola was a part of Sysmä until 1784. At the time, the Hartola parish also included Joutsa, Luhanka, Leivonmäki and the western part of Pertunmaa.

<doc id="784603" wikidata="Q1317101" url="?curid=784603" title="&quot;I quit&quot; match">
<text>An &quot;I quit&quot; match is a type of professional wrestling submission match in which the only way to win is to make the opponent verbally concede to the referee (usually into a microphone). It is a variation of the submission match as it can only be won by submission, but it is special in that the submission has to take the form of the forfeiting opponent conceding verbally. Generally, whenever a wrestler knocks down their opponent with a move or inflicts a submission move, the opponent will be asked—either by the referee or the opponent—to say the concession into a microphone. &quot;I quit&quot; matches are commonly used to settle (kayfabe) grudges and embarrass rivals since saying &quot;I quit&quot; is usually a sign of admitted inferiority.

== History ==
The first &quot;I quit&quot; match was in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)/Jim Crockett Promotions at Starrcade on November 28, 1985. Magnum T. A. defeated Tully Blanchard in a match (with a cage around the ring) for Blanchard&#x27;s NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Near the end of that match, Magnum used a piece of wood with a nail in it to pierce Blanchard&#x27;s forehead. At that point, Blanchard screamed &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; into the microphone, indicating that he was conceding the match, awarding Magnum the championship.

One of the most famous &quot;I quit&quot; matches took place on January 24, 1999, at the Royal Rumble between The Rock and Mick Foley (as Mankind) in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) for the WWF Championship. The match lasted just over 20 minutes, ending after Foley took eleven unprotected chair shots to the head while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. The Rock eventually won the match, but it was later revealed that Foley was completely unconscious and The Rock had played a tape of Foley&#x27;s concession announcement over the public address system. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock&#x27;s &quot;I quit!&quot; match against Triple H ended when Triple H was extorted into a verbal concession because Kane was about to chokeslam Chyna. John Cena retained his WWE Championship by defeating John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in an &quot;I quit&quot; match at Judgment Day on May 22, 2005. At Breaking Point on September 13, 2009, Cena defeated his long time rival Randy Orton in an &quot;I quit&quot; match to win the WWE Championship, forcing Orton to verbally concede while he was handcuffed and Cena simultaneously had applied his submission hold, the STF.

&quot;I quit&quot; matches involving women have been rare. At No Mercy on October 19, 2003, there was an intergender match between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and his daughter Stephanie partly under &quot;I quit&quot; rules. However, the match was decided when Stephanie&#x27;s mother Linda threw in the towel for her daughter, giving Vince the victory. The first &quot;I quit&quot; match between WWE Divas was contested at One Night Stand on June 1, 2008, when Beth Phoenix defeated Melina.

On the May 14, 2009 episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) put on its first &quot;I quit&quot; match, where Booker T defeated Jethro Holiday after an axe kick. TNA had another &quot;I quit&quot; match on May 24, 2009, where A.J. Styles defeated Booker T to retain the TNA Legends Championship after Jenna Morasca threw a towel into the ring for Booker T.

On the May 4, 2016 episode of &quot;Lucha Underground&quot;, Sexy Star defeated Mariposa in the promotion&#x27;s first &quot;I quit&quot; match, known in Spanish as a &quot;no mas&quot; (&quot;no more&quot;) match.

An &quot;I respect you&quot; match is a variation of the &quot;I quit&quot; match where the winning concession was &quot;I respect you&quot;. The first &quot;I respect you&quot; match was held in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at SuperBrawl VI on February 11, 1996, and pitted Brian Pillman and Kevin Sullivan. At the end of the match, Pillman conceded by saying &quot;I respect you, bookerman!&quot;. In doing so, Pillman broke kayfabe as Sullivan was also WCW booker at the time.

One January 17, 2017 episode of &quot;WWE 205 Live&quot;, Jack Gallagher defeated Ariya Daivari in an &quot;I forfeit&quot; match where that phrase was the conceding phrase.

<doc id="784606" wikidata="Q5583544" url="?curid=784606" title="Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)">
<text>Goodnight Sweetheart is a British science fiction time travel sitcom, starring Nicholas Lyndhurst, created by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, and produced by the BBC. The sitcom is about the life of Gary Sparrow, an accidental time traveller who leads a double life through the use of a time portal, which allows him to travel between the London of the 1990s and the London of the 1940s during the Second World War. The sitcom&#x27;s creators, who also created &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; and &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, wrote most of the plots for the episodes.

The sitcom premiered on BBC1 on 18 November 1993 and ran for six series until its conclusion on 28 June 1999, with repeats after this date being aired on ITV3, Gold, Drama, Yesterday and Forces TV on Sky Digital. Lyndhurst&#x27;s involvement in the sitcom allowed him to win the Most Popular Comedy Performer at the National Television Awards in 1998 and 1999. On 2 September 2016, the sitcom received a one-off special entitled &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;, following events after the final episode. The sitcom itself later received a musical adaptation in 2017.

== Premise ==

&quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; is about the life of Gary Sparrow (Nicholas Lyndhurst). In 1993, Gary works as a TV repairman, who struggles with his life and the marriage to his ambitious wife Yvonne. He is best friends with Ron Wheatcroft, a printer whose marriage is on the brink of collapse. On attending a TV repair call-out in London&#x27;s East End, Gary accidentally discovers a time portal at &quot;Duckett&#x27;s Passage&quot;, which leads to wartime London, where he meets Phoebe Bamford, a pretty barmaid who works in the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; pub; her father Eric who runs the pub and Reg Deadman, a dim-witted but friendly policeman. Gary strikes up a relationship with Phoebe. He finds he can use the time portal to travel between the 1990s and the 1940s and he uses it to continue seeing Phoebe. To ensure his visits do not interfere with history, Gary brings in assistance from Ron as a confidant, to aid him with problems and to supply him with 1940s five-pound notes and identity documents.

Gary soon finds himself leading a double life. When visiting Phoebe, he explains his absences through working as a secret agent, using his knowledge of future wartime events to his advantage in the deception, also claiming to be a singer-songwriter, passing off modern pop songs as his and supplying many items from the present that were rationed in wartime Britain. When with Yvonne, Gary initially claims his absences to be major call-outs for his work but after losing his job in 1995 to buy and run a shop called &quot;Blitz &#x27;n&#x27; Pieces&quot; – selling goods he acquires in the 1940s as rare memorabilia, to maintain access to the time portal in the present – he uses it to lie that he has to be absent to conduct buying trips for stock.

Over the next five years, Gary&#x27;s life is further complicated by his relationships with the two women. Phoebe eventually takes over the running of the Royal Oak after the death of her father Eric, later marrying Gary, despite him committing bigamy. (Gary rationalises this with the technicality that — because of his travels between eras — he isn&#x27;t married to two women &quot;at the same time&quot;.) His marriage with Phoebe results in a son, Michael. Gary moves into a luxury flat in Mayfair, with Reg becoming a doorman in their building after retiring from the police. Yvonne becomes pregnant, only to suffer a miscarriage but she later becomes successful with her organic beauty products, opening a company and transforming into a millionaire, allowing her and Gary to own a luxury apartment. Ron later faces a divorce, losing his home and control of his printing company, adding to Gary&#x27;s problems, who eventually allows him to have the lease for his Mayfair flat in the present. During his time in the past, Gary has encounters with several historical figures, including Winston Churchill, George Formby and Noël Coward, dealing with some of the peculiar effects of time travel during various trips.

&quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; eventually concludes in 1945 during VE Day. In 1999, Yvonne becomes suspicious of Gary&#x27;s frequent absences and follows him to the shop, where she witnesses his disappearance through the time portal. Gary later becomes trapped in the past when the portal closes after he saves Clement Attlee from an assassination attempt by poisoning. He later deduces that it was his destiny to travel back in time with the purpose of saving Attlee&#x27;s life and the portal closed because he had fulfilled this purpose. Gary is resigned to being forced to stay with Phoebe and their son, though he writes a message behind a strip of wallpaper of his Mayfair flat, knowing that Ron is redecorating it in 1999. Gary&#x27;s writing appears before Ron and Yvonne, advising him to tell Yvonne everything. The final episode of the original series cuts to Yvonne standing at the gates of Blitz &#x27;n&#x27; Pieces, wondering whether or not they would meet again, before being joined by Ron. In 1945, Gary is standing in Duckett&#x27;s Passage, wondering the same, before being joined by Phoebe and Michael.

=== Many Happy Returns ===
In the one-off 2016 special, Gary is still married to Phoebe as they live through the 1960s with their son Michael, who is a teenager. Gary, missing the modern world, decides to visit the hospital where his younger self is being born but inadvertently encounters his father who faints, leaving him to hold his younger self. The incident causes Gary to be thrown into the future in the 2010s, arriving in the men&#x27;s toilets of a trendy burger joint in east London, where his former shop was. During his visit, Gary meets Yvonne, now a multimillionaire investor, with Ron as her tenant in the basement. To his shock, Gary learns that Yvonne got pregnant before the closure of the time portal in 1999 and that he now has a 16-year-old daughter named Ellie. After meeting her, Gary contemplates living a double life again, upon finding a new time portal has opened, hoping to get to know his daughter, whilst still maintaining his life in the 1960s.

== Episodes ==
A total of 59 episodes were made, including a Christmas special in 1995 and a special in 2016. Marks and Gran, the creators, wrote the first series; many later episodes were written by other writers. As in Marks and Gran&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Get Back&quot;, most episodes of &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; — and the programme — were named after popular song titles, others being derived from film titles. The show is named after the song &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot;, a popular song of the 1930s and 1940s, popularised by Al Bowlly in 1931; it was later sung by Nick Curtis as the series signature tune. During one episode Gary and Phoebe refer to Bowlly&#x27;s death during the Second World War. Because of a script-editing error, two episodes (series one, episode six and series four, episode two) were both titled &quot;In the Mood&quot;. There is no special connection between these two episodes.

== Cast ==
== DVD releases ==
All six series and the 1995 Christmas Special have been released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) with music edits made to certain episodes, the Christmas special was released on the third series DVD. The first five series have been released in Australia (Region 4).
* Although the 2016 special &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; has not been released onto DVD, it was released digitally in September 2016 on BBC Store.

== Future ==
The show&#x27;s writers and producers have stated they have received thousands of emails and letters regarding the show wishing for its return to the small screen. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran have both stated that while there are no plans to bring the series back, it might possibly come back if the musical is made and is a success. On 5 July 2016 it was announced that the show would be returning to BBC One for a one-off special, as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;landmark sitcom season&quot;. Unlike the original series, which was filmed in London, it was filmed and produced at dock10 studios, in Salford Quays. Marks and Gran wrote the script and Lyndhurst returned to the role of Gary Sparrow. The special episode aired on 2 September 2016 on BBC One. It received a positive response.

===Musical===
Since 2014 there was talk of &quot;Goodnight Sweetheart&quot; being turned into a musical and in December 2017, dates for a stage musical were announced. This jukebox style musical would feature songs from the 1940s and 1980s with the world premiere taking place at the Brookside Theatre, Romford in September 2018.

<doc id="784611" wikidata="Q946124" url="?curid=784611" title="Little Feat">
<text>Little Feat is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California formed by lead vocalist and guitarist Lowell George, bassist Roy Estrada (both formerly of the Mothers of Invention), keyboardist Bill Payne, and drummer Richie Hayward in 1969. The band&#x27;s classic line-up, in place by late 1972, comprised George, Payne, Hayward, bassist Kenny Gradney, guitarist and vocalist Paul Barrere, and percussionist Sam Clayton. George disbanded the group because of creative differences shortly before his death in 1979. Surviving members re-formed Little Feat in 1987 and the band has remained active to the present.

==History==
===Formative years===
Singer and guitarist Lowell George met keyboardist Bill Payne when George was a member of Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention. They formed Little Feat in 1969 along with former Mothers bassist Roy Estrada, and drummer Richie Hayward from George&#x27;s previous band, The Factory. Hayward had also been a member of the Fraternity of Man whose claim to fame was the inclusion of their &quot;Don&#x27;t Bogart That Joint&quot; on the million-selling &quot;Easy Rider&quot; film soundtrack. The name of the band came from a comment made by the Mothers&#x27; drummer Jimmy Carl Black about Lowell&#x27;s &quot;little feet&quot;. The spelling of &quot;feat&quot; was an homage to the Beatles.

There are three stories about the genesis of Little Feat. One has it that George showed Zappa his song &quot;Willin&#x27;,&quot; and that Zappa fired him from the Mothers of Invention, because he felt that George was too talented to merely be a member of his band and told him he ought to go away and form his own band. The second version has Zappa firing him for playing a 15-minute guitar solo with his amplifier off. The third version says that Zappa fired him because &quot;Willin contains drug references (&quot;weed, whites and wine&quot;). George often introduced the song as the reason he was asked to leave the band. On October 18, 1975 at the Auditorium Theater in Rochester, New York while introducing the song, George commented that he was asked to leave the band for &quot;writing a song about dope&quot;. 
In any version, Zappa was instrumental in getting George and his new band a contract with Warner Bros. Records. The eponymous first album delivered to Warner Bros. was recorded mostly in August and September 1970 and was released in January 1971. When it came time to record &quot;Willin&#x27;,&quot; George had hurt his hand in an accident with a model airplane, so Ry Cooder sat in and played the song&#x27;s slide part. Lowell&#x27;s accident is referenced on the cover art of the band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Under the Radar&quot;. &quot;Willin would be re-recorded with George playing slide for Little Feat&#x27;s second album &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot;, which was also the first Little Feat album to include cover art by Neon Park, who had painted the cover for the Mothers&#x27; &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;. Park&#x27;s surrealist art would continue for all of Little Feat&#x27;s album covers through to his death in 1993.

Sometime during the recording of the first two albums, the band members along with ex-Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black (&quot;the Indian of the group&quot;) backed soul singer Nolan Porter on his first album, &quot;No Apologies&quot;.

The first two albums received nearly universal critical acclaim, and &quot;Willin became a standard, subsequently popularized by its inclusion on Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s album &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;.

Despite good reviews of &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot;, lack of commercial success led to the band splitting up, with Estrada leaving to join Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band, although he has given other reasons for quitting the band, such as to get away from the Los Angeles pollution and the L.A. city life.

===Classic line-up and change of direction===
In late 1972 Little Feat reformed, with bassist Kenny Gradney replacing Estrada. The band also added a second guitarist in Paul Barrere, who had known George since they attended Hollywood High School in California, and percussionist Sam Clayton (brother of session singer Merry Clayton and the brother-in-law of the jazz saxophonist Curtis Amy) and as a result the band was expanded from a quartet to a sextet. Both Barrere and Clayton added vocals on many songs, although all the band members provided backing vocals in various tunes.

This new lineup radically altered the band&#x27;s sound, leaning toward New Orleans funk. The group went on to record &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; (1973)—one of the band&#x27;s most popular albums, which incorporated New Orleans musical influences and styles—as well as &quot;Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot; (1974), which was a studio-recorded attempt to capture some of the energy of their live shows (the name of the latter album pays homage to the Fats Waller song).

In 1973, Payne, Gradney, Barrere, Clayton and George (incorrectly credited as George Lowell) collaborated with jazz drummer Chico Hamilton on his Stax album &quot;Chico the Master&quot;, which is a strong showcase for the band&#x27;s leanings toward funk and R&amp;B. In 1973, Little Feat backed Kathy Dalton on her &quot;Amazing &quot; album on the DiscReet label produced by Warner Brothers. 
Due to disappointing sales, the band disbanded a second time in late 1973. Payne joined the Doobie Brothers and Hayward joined Ike Turner. 

They reformed in 1974, releasing their fourth album &quot;Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot; later that year.
In 1974, Lowell George, along with the Meters and other session musicians, backed Robert Palmer on his Island Records debut solo release &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Sally Through the Alley&quot; which opened with George&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Shoes.&quot; The whole band chipped in on Palmer&#x27;s 1975 release, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, which contained another George composition, &quot;Trouble&quot;. 1976&#x27;s &quot;Some People Can Do What They Like&quot;, Palmer&#x27;s third opus, opened with the Bill Payne/Fran Tate composition &quot;One Last Look&quot;, and later featured George&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Moon&quot;, although George and Gradney sat this one out. In March 1976, Little Feat served as the backing band on the first side of Akiko Yano&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;&quot;, released on the Philips label. The band remained based in Los Angeles due to doing session work on the side in addition to band activities.

The release of &quot;The Last Record Album&quot; in 1975 signalled another change in the Little Feat sound, with Barrere and Payne developing an interest in jazz-rock. Prior to the recording of &quot;The Last Record Album&quot;, drummer Richie Hayward had a motorcycle accident and the liner to the LP release of &quot;The Last Record Album&quot; was decorated with copies of his many hospital bills. Also present was evidence of a late change to the running order of tracks: the lyrics for Barrere&#x27;s song &quot;Hi Roller&quot; were printed on the sleeve, but scored out, and the words &quot;maybe next time&quot; scrawled over them. Sure enough, &quot;Hi Roller&quot; was the first track on the subsequent album &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot;.

George continued to produce the albums, but his songwriting contribution diminished as the group moved into jazz fusion, a style in which he had little interest. In August 1977, Little Feat recorded a live album from gigs at the Rainbow Theatre in London and Lisner Auditorium in Washington, D.C. &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; is considered by many rock music critics to be one of the best live albums of all time, despite the fact that significant portions of George&#x27;s vocals and slide work were over-dubbed later in the studio. It was released in 1978, by which time it had become apparent that George&#x27;s interest in the band was waning, as was his health.

===Death of George and band breakup===
Little Feat began working on a new album, &quot;Down on the Farm&quot;, before disbanding in 1979. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book &quot;Written in My Soul&quot;) conducted eleven days before his death, George made it clear that he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne&#x27;s attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped &quot;into one of his &#x27;Day at the Dog Races&#x27;. I just got out of there as fast as I could. It was embarrassing&quot;. In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barrere.

At this time Warner Bros. released George&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Thanks, I&#x27;ll Eat It Here&quot;, for which he had signed a contract in 1975. The album was mostly a collection of cover versions that George had been working on as a side project for several years and, in his biography &quot;Rock And Roll Doctor&quot;, Mark Brend states that George had hinted he only signed the solo contract to obtain funds to finance Little Feat (and Bill Flanagan states in &quot;Written in My Soul&quot; that George &quot;didn&#x27;t want his audience to assume a collection of other people&#x27;s material marked the direction of Lowell George&#x27;s solo career&quot;).

While touring in support of his solo album in June 1979, at the age of 34, George collapsed and died in his hotel room in Arlington, Virginia. An autopsy determined the cause of death was a heart attack.

The surviving members finished and released &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; in late 1979. A double compilation album of rare studio outtakes and live recordings, &quot;Hoy-Hoy!&quot;, was released in 1981. The album is an overview of the history and sound of Little Feat and includes a cover of the Hank Williams song &quot;Lonesome Whistle&quot;.

In 1981 and 1982, Barrere, Clayton, Gradney and Hayward performed several shows as &quot;Barrere, Clayton, Gradney and Hayward&quot; along with singer/guitarist Phil Brown.

Barrere then released two solo albums, 1983&#x27;s &quot;On My Own Two Feet&quot; (Mirage) and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Real Lies&quot; (Atlantic). Richie Hayward was the drummer on Robert Plant&#x27;s 1985 funk and new wave flavoured &quot;Shaken &#x27;n&#x27; Stirred&quot; (Es Paranza). Payne has always been a popular and busy session musician, as well as a songwriter, and during the band&#x27;s first hiatus performed on a variety of albums by many famous musicians including J. J. Cale, the Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, and Stevie Nicks. He was a guest performer on Raitt&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Forgiveness&quot; in 1977, which featured his composition &quot;Takin&#x27; My Time.&quot;

===Fuller years (1987–1993)===
In 1986, Hayward, Barrere and Payne were invited to play on &quot;Blue Slipper&quot;, the 1987 debut album by Helen Watson. They subsequently appeared on her second album &quot;The Weather Inside&quot;. The surviving former members of Little Feat then reformed in 1987 when Barrere, Clayton, Gradney, Hayward and Payne added songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Craig Fuller, formerly from the band Pure Prairie League, and Fred Tackett on guitar, mandolin and trumpet. The band admired Fuller&#x27;s previous work and were impressed when he toured with them in 1978 as part of the Fuller/Kaz band. They didn&#x27;t require an audition, having played with him on tour, and thus, the new Little Feat lineup was formed. The initial release by the new lineup, &quot;Let It Roll&quot;, was a tremendous success and Fuller&#x27;s presence proved to be a major factor. His strong vocals and songwriting abilities were showcased, co-writing 8 of the 10 songs and handling a large share of lead vocals. The first single, &quot;Hate to Lose Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, earned the band their first No. 1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. All Music Guide critic Stephen Erlewine stated &quot;What&#x27;s surprising about &quot;Let It Roll&quot; is not just that it works, but that it works smashingly.&quot; The LP garnered Feat a certified gold record status on February 14, 1989. On the heels of this success, previous Feat releases experienced a surge in sales. The 1978 live release &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; went platinum in November 1989. &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;, originally released on January 25, 1973, went gold the same month. The band received more exposure than ever, including an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Concerts were booked nationally, and Little Feat played enthusiastic, sold-out shows.

The follow-up album, &quot;Representing the Mambo&quot;, released in 1990, proved to be the group&#x27;s last album for Warner Bros., who were uncomfortable with the album&#x27;s jazzier leanings. The third and final album by this lineup, &quot;Shake Me Up&quot; (1991), was released on Morgan Creek, as was the soundtrack of the 1992 film &quot;White Sands&quot; which contained one song by Little Feat called &quot;Quicksand and Lies&quot;, but this label folded soon afterwards and Little Feat moved from one label to another until the establishment of Hot Tomato Records in 2002.

In the fall of 1991, Clayton was forced to miss several tour dates due to ill health.

Fuller departed in 1993, stating that touring required too much time away from his family. He went on to join a re-formed Pure Prairie League, who in 2005 released their critically acclaimed &quot;All in Good Time,&quot; which heavily featured his songwriting, singing and acoustic guitar. Up until leaving PPL again in 2011, he performed about 40 shows yearly with them, as well as occasional shows with Little Feat in addition to performing solo shows.

===Murphy years (1993–2009)===
Fuller was replaced by Shaun Murphy in September 1993. Murphy had sung on all of the recent Little Feat albums and throughout 1993 she had toured as part of Bob Seger&#x27;s band with Fred Tackett and Bill Payne.

Murphy&#x27;s first album with the group was &quot;Ain&#x27;t Had Enough Fun&quot;. As well as having material specifically written for her, fans attracted to her hard-edged powerhouse voice, further albums &quot;Under the Radar&quot; and &quot;Chinese Work Songs&quot; saw Murphy become an integral part of the group sharing lead vocals and writing with Payne and Barrere. Her rendition of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh&quot; was first recorded in studio on &quot;Chinese Work Songs&quot; and became a favorite in live appearances with Murphy. After recording five studio albums and performing over 1,400 concerts with the band, Murphy was dismissed in 2009, and the group pared down to a six-piece collective entity.

In 2008, the group released &quot;Join the Band&quot;, an album featuring collaborations with Jimmy Buffett, Dave Matthews, Emmylou Harris, Bob Seger, Béla Fleck, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Chris Robinson, Vince Gill, Mike Gordon, and Inara George.

===Hayward illness and death===
In August 2009, Richie Hayward announced that he had recently been diagnosed with a severe liver disease and would be unable to work indefinitely. A benefit concert was organized and a website created where fans unable to attend could donate toward his treatment costs. Little Feat announced that their drum technician Gabe Ford would take his place.

Hayward married and was living on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, with his liver cancer in remission as he awaited a transplant. On July 11, 2010, Little Feat played at the Vancouver Island Music Festival and Hayward was slated to play just a couple of tunes, but once he sat behind his kit, he finished out the night. Hayward had intended to return to the band in the event of recovery, but he died on August 12, 2010, from pneumonia and complications from lung disease.

===2012 and beyond===
In June 2012, Little Feat released their first album of new material in nine years, &quot;Rooster Rag&quot;.

In 2014, the band Leftover Salmon announced that Bill Payne had joined with them as a permanent member. He left in 2015 to take up a permanent post in The Doobie Brothers&#x27; touring band: this restricted his ability to perform longer tours with Little Feat. After this, the full band would perform around 10 dates per year, while Barrere, Tackett, Gradney and Ford would sometimes tour playing Little Feat material as a four-piece called Funky Feat.

In 1994, Paul Barrere had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C and, in 2013, took a leave of absence from touring with Little Feat to combat the disease, and to remain close to his health providers. He later performed a few one-off gigs with Fred Tackett as an acoustic duo and recorded collaborations with longtime friend Roger Cole. In August 2015, it was announced that he was suffering from liver cancer. In 2017 the band was joined for some shows by the Midnight Ramble Horns (Steve Bernstein, Jay Collins, and Erik Lawrence) who then augmented the band for the 50th Anniversary tour of 2018. They continue to often join the band on selected dates. The band then toured more sporadically during the next four years.

Paul Barrere died on October 26, 2019. Scott Sharrard, who had filled in for Barrere during Little Feat&#x27;s 50th Anniversary tour, was later brought on board as a full-time band member.

On September 16, 2020, the band released a video rerecording of the 1975 Lowell George song &quot;Long Distance Love&quot;. The video introduced a new band lineup with Tony Leone, known for his work with Levon Helm and Phil Lesh, joining on drums in place of Gabe Ford. Levon Helm&#x27;s daughter Amy guested on backing vocals - she and Leone had previously played together in Ollabelle. A new song, the first in eight years, &quot;When All Boats Rise&quot;, was released in late October 2020.

The band&#x27;s latest studio album &quot;Sam&#x27;s Place&quot; was released in May 2024. It marks the first Little Feat album where Sam Clayton provides lead vocals on every song.

==Legacy==
Some of the prominent musicians and bands to play and record the music of Little Feat include Phish, The Black Crowes, The Byrds, The Bridge, Garth Brooks, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Steve Earle, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Taylor Hicks, Ron Holloway, Keisuke Kuwata, Nicolette Larson, Nazareth, Robert Palmer, The Radiators, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Seatrain, John Sebastian, Richard Shindell, Carly Simon, Mick Taylor, Van Halen, Joe Walsh, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Sam Bush, Coco Montoya, Vince Herman, Inara George, Stephen Bruton, Widespread Panic, Warren Haynes and Gov&#x27;t Mule, Blackberry Smoke, Jimmy Buffett, Anders Osborne,Tedeschi Trucks Band and Gregg Allman.

In 2010, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey Phish covered Little Feat&#x27;s album, &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot;, for their annual Halloween show. As a result of this concert and the distribution of its recording, the album gained recognition from a wider audience among younger listeners. In 2018, at Peach Fest at Montage Mountain in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the remaining members of Little Feat joined forces with moe., the Turkuaz Horns and the Ramble Band Horns to recreate and pay homage to the band&#x27;s classic live album &quot;Waiting For Columbus&quot;.

Little Feat&#x27;s songs &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot; and &quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub&quot; were featured prominently in the 2010 Edward Norton film &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot;

Guitarist Jimmy Page stated that Little Feat was his favorite American band in a 1975 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview.

==Musical style==
Little Feat’s musical style is marked by an eclectic fusion of genres, incorporating elements of rock, blues, jazz, country, and funk. Early albums like &quot;Sailin’ Shoes&quot; introduced a blend of country rock with folk influences, while &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; showcased a distinctive New Orleans-inspired funk sound that became a hallmark of their style. Their music is also known for its complex rhythms and instrumental improvisations, influenced by bandleader Lowell George&#x27;s bottleneck guitar work, a defining aspect of their early recordings.

Critics often compare their fan base to that of the Grateful Dead due to their devoted following and the band’s turbulent lineup changes. Rolling Stone has described them as a “cult band” with a sound that drew on the musical traditions of cities like New Orleans and Memphis, but with an idiosyncratic twist, blending Southern and swamp rock elements into a “zany South-West synthesis.” By the late 1970s, They began incorporating jazz-rock fusion, evident in tracks such as &quot;Day at the Dog Races&quot;, reflecting a shift in their sound toward jazz influences.

Their live performances are celebrated for their jam band qualities, often characterized by extended instrumental sections that capture the improvisational spirit of jazz while retaining a Southern rock foundation. &quot;Glide&quot; magazine noted that &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; and its surreal cover art became iconic for the band, underscoring their fusion of music and visual artistry and cementing their status as a lasting influence in American rock music.

<text>Hasdai ben Abraham Crescas (; ; c. 1340 in Barcelona – 1410/11 in Zaragoza) was a Spanish-Jewish philosopher and a renowned halakhist (teacher of Jewish law). Along with Maimonides (&quot;Rambam&quot;), Gersonides (&quot;Ralbag&quot;), and Joseph Albo, he is known as one of the major practitioners of the rationalist approach to Jewish philosophy.

==Biography==

Hasdai Crescas came from a family of scholars. He was the grandson of the Talmudist Hasdai ben Judah Crescas, and a disciple of the Talmudist and philosopher Nissim ben Reuben, known as the &quot;RaN&quot;. Following in the footsteps of his teacher he became a Talmudic authority and a philosopher of great originality. He is considered important in the history of modern thought for his deep influence on Baruch Spinoza.

After leaving Barcelona, he held the administrative position of crown rabbi in Aragon. He seems to have been active as a teacher. Among his fellow students and friends, Isaac ben Sheshet (known as the &quot;RIBaSH&quot;), famous for his responsa, takes precedence. Joseph Albo is the best known of his pupils, but at least two others have won recognition, Rabbi Mattathias of Saragossa, and Rabbi Zechariah ha-Levi.

Crescas was a man of means. As such he was appointed sole executor of the will of his uncle Vitalis Azday by the King John I of Aragon in 1393. Still, though enjoying the high esteem even of prominent non-Jews, he did not escape the common fate of his coreligionists. Imprisoned with his teacher upon a false accusation of host desecration in 1378, he suffered personal indignities because he was a Jew. His only son died in a massacre in Barcelona in 1391, a martyr for his faith, during the anti-Judaic persecutions of that period. Nevertheless, he kept his faith.

Notwithstanding this bereavement, his mental powers were unbroken; for the works that have made him famous were written after that terrible year. In 1401-02 he visited Joseph Orabuena at Pamplona at the request of the King of Navarre, who paid the expenses of his journey to various Navarrese towns (Jacobs, l.c. Nos. 1570, 1574). He was at that time described as &quot;Rav of Saragossa.&quot;

==Works==
His works on Jewish law, if indeed ever committed to writing – have not reached us. But his concise philosophical work &quot;Or Adonai&quot;, &quot;The Light of the Lord&quot; became a classical Jewish refutation of medieval Aristotelianism, and a harbinger of the scientific revolution in the 16th century.

Three of his writings have been preserved:
#His primary work, &quot;Or Adonai&quot;, &quot;The Light of the Lord&quot;.
#An exposition and refutation of the main doctrines of Christianity. This treatise was written in Catalan in 1398. The Catalan original is no longer extant; but a Hebrew translation by Joseph ibn Shem-Tov, with the title (&quot;Refutation of the Cardinal Principles of the Christians&quot;), has been preserved. The work was composed at the solicitation of Spanish noblemen. Crescas&#x27; object in writing what is virtually an apologetic treatise on Judaism was to present the reasons which held the Jews fast to their ancestral faith.
#His letter to the congregations of Avignon, published as an appendix to Wiener&#x27;s edition of &quot;Shevet Yehudah&quot; (see above), in which he relates the incidents of the persecution of 1391.

<text>An eyelid ( ) is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects an eye. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle retracts the eyelid, exposing the cornea to the outside, giving vision. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily. &quot;Palpebral&quot; (and &quot;blepharal&quot;) means relating to the eyelids. Its key function is to regularly spread the tears and other secretions on the eye surface to keep it moist, since the cornea must be continuously moist. They keep the eyes from drying out when asleep. Moreover, the blink reflex protects the eye from foreign bodies. A set of specialized hairs known as lashes grow from the upper and lower eyelid margins to further protect the eye from dust and debris. 

The appearance of the human upper eyelid often varies between different populations. The prevalence of an epicanthic fold covering the inner corner of the eye account for the majority of East Asian and Southeast Asian populations, and is also found in varying degrees among other populations. Separately, but also similarly varying between populations, the crease of the remainder of the eyelid may form either a &quot;single eyelid&quot;, a &quot;double eyelid&quot;, or an intermediate form.

Eyelids can be found in other animals, some of which may have a third eyelid, or nictitating membrane. A vestige of this in humans survives as the plica semilunaris.

==Structure==
===Layers===
The eyelid is made up of several layers; from superficial to deep, these are: skin, subcutaneous tissue, orbicularis oculi, orbital septum and tarsal plates, and palpebral conjunctiva. The meibomian glands lie within the eyelid and secrete the lipid part of the tear film.

===Skin===
The skin is similar to areas elsewhere, but is relatively thin and has more pigment cells. In diseased persons, these may wander and cause a discoloration of the lids. It contains sweat glands and hairs, the latter becoming eyelashes as the border of the eyelid is met. The skin of the eyelid contains the greatest concentration of sebaceous glands found anywhere in the body.

===Nerve supply===
In humans, the sensory nerve supply to the upper eyelids is from the infratrochlear, supratrochlear, supraorbital and the lacrimal nerves from the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The skin of the lower eyelid is supplied by branches of the infratrochlear at the medial angle. The rest is supplied by branches of the infraorbital nerve of the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve.

===Blood supply===
In humans, the eyelids are supplied with blood by two arches on each upper and lower lid. The arches are formed by anastomoses of the lateral palpebral arteries and medial palpebral arteries, branching off from the lacrimal artery and ophthalmic artery, respectively.

=== Eyelashes ===
The eyelashes (or simply lashes) are hairs that grow on the edges of the upper and lower eyelids. The lashes are short (upper lashes are typically just 7 to 8 mm in length) hairs, though can be exceptionally long (occasionally up to 15 mm in length) and prominent in some individuals with trichomegaly. The lashes protect the eye from dust and debris by catching them via rapid blinking when the blink reflex is triggered by the debris touching the lashes. Long lashes also play a significant part in facial attractiveness.

==Function==
The eyelids close or blink voluntarily and involuntarily to protect the eye from foreign bodies, and keep the surface of the cornea moist. The upper and lower human eyelids feature a set of eyelashes which grow in up to 6 rows along each eyelid margin, and serve to heighten the protection of the eye from dust and foreign debris, as well as from perspiration.

==Clinical significance==
Any condition that affects the eyelid is called eyelid disorder. The most common eyelid disorders, their causes, symptoms and treatments are the following:
* Hordeolum (stye) is an infection of the sebaceous glands of Zeis usually caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; bacteria, similar to the more common condition Acne vulgaris. It is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms and it appears similar to a red bump placed underneath the eyelid. The main symptoms of styes include pain, redness of the eyelid and sometimes swollen eyelids. Styes usually disappear within a week without treatment. Otherwise, antibiotics may be prescribed and home remedies such as warm water compresses may be used to promote faster healing. Styes are normally harmless and do not cause long lasting damage.
* Chalazion (plural: chalazia) is caused by the obstruction of the oil glands and can occur in both upper and lower eyelids. Chalazia may be mistaken for styes due to the similar symptoms. This condition is however less painful and it tends to be chronic. Chalazia heal within a few months if treatment is administered and otherwise they can resorb within two years. Chalazia that do not respond to topical medication are usually treated with surgery as a last resort.
* Blepharitis is the irritation of the lid margin, where eyelashes join the eyelid. This is a common condition that causes inflammation of the eyelids and which is quite difficult to manage because it tends to recur. This condition is mainly caused by staphylococcus infection and scalp dandruff. Blepharitis symptoms include burning sensation, the feeling that there is something in the eye, excessive tearing, blurred vision, redness of the eye, light sensitivity, red and swollen eyelids, dry eye and sometimes crusting of the eyelashes on awakening. Treatment normally consists in maintaining a good hygiene of the eye and holding warm compresses on the affected eyelid to remove the crusts. Gently scrubbing the eyelid with the warm compress is recommended as it eases the healing process. In more serious cases, antibiotics may be prescribed.
* &quot;Demodex&quot; mites are a genus of tiny mites that live as commensals in and around the hair follicles of numerous mammals including humans, cats and dogs. Human demodex mites typically live in the follicles of the eyebrows and eyelashes. While normally harmless, human demodex mites can sometimes cause irritation of the skin (demodicosis) in persons with weakened immune systems.
* Entropion usually results from aging, but sometimes can be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle, or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from surgery, injury, or disease. It is an asymptomatic condition that can, rarely, lead to trichiasis, which requires surgery. It mostly affects the lower lid, and is characterized by the turning inward of the lid, toward the globe.
* Ectropion is another aging-related eyelid condition that may lead to chronic eye irritation and scarring. It may also be the result of allergies and its main symptoms are pain, excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva. 
* Laxity is also another aging-related eyelid condition that can lead to dryness and irritation. Surgery may be necessary to repair the eyelid to its natural position. In certain instances, excessive lower lid laxity creates the Fornix of Reiss – a pocket between the lower eyelid and globe – which is the ideal location to administer topical ophthalmic medications.
* Eyelid edema is a condition in which the eyelids are swollen and tissues contain excess fluid. It may affect eye function when it increases the intraocular pressure. Eyelid edema is caused by allergy, trichiasis or infections. The main symptoms are swollen red eyelids, pain, and itching. Chronic eyelid edema can lead to blepharochalasis.
* Eyelid tumors may also occur. Basal cell carcinomas are the most frequently encountered kind of cancer affecting the eyelid, making up 85% to 95% of all malignant eyelid tumors. The tumors may be benign or malignant. Usually benign tumors are localized and removed before becoming a cancerous threat and before they become large enough to impair vision. Malignant tumors on the other hand tend to spread to surrounding areas and tissues.
* Blepharospasm (eyelid twitching) is an involuntary spasm of the eyelid muscle. The most common factors that make the muscle in the eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. Eyelid twitching is not considered a harmful condition and therefore there is no treatment available. Patients are however advised to get more sleep and drink less caffeine.
* Eyelid dermatitis is the inflammation of the eyelid skin. It is mostly a result of allergies or contact dermatitis of the eyelid. Symptoms include dry and flaky skin on the eyelids and swollen eyelids. The affected eyelid may itch. Treatment consists in proper eye hygiene and avoiding the allergens that trigger the condition. In rare cases, topical creams may be used but only under a doctor&#x27;s supervision.
* Ptosis (drooping eyelid) is when the upper eyelid droops or sags due to weakness or paralysis of the levator muscle (responsible for raising the eyelid), or due to damage to nerves controlling the muscle. It can be a manifestation of the normal aging process, a congenital condition, or due to an injury or disease. Risk factors related to ptosis include diabetes, stroke, Horner syndrome, Bell&#x27;s Palsy (compression/damage to Facial nerve), myasthenia gravis, brain tumor or other cancers that can affect nerve or muscle function.
* Ablepharia (ablepharon) is the congenital absence of or reduction in the size of the eyelids.

===Surgery===
The eyelid surgeries are called blepharoplasties and are performed either for medical reasons or to alter one&#x27;s facial appearance.

Most of the cosmetic eyelid surgeries are aimed to enhance the look of the face and to boost self-confidence by restoring a youthful eyelid appearance. They are intended to remove fat and excess skin that may be found on the eyelids after a certain age.

Eyelid surgeries are also performed to improve peripheral vision or to treat chalazion, eyelid tumors, ptosis, extropion, trichiasis, and other eyelid-related conditions.

Eyelid surgeries are overall safe procedures but they carry certain risks since the area on which the operation is performed is so close to the eye.

==Anatomical variation==


An anatomical variation in humans occurs in the creases and folds of the upper eyelid.

An epicanthic fold, the skin fold of the upper eyelid covering the inner corner (medial canthus) of the eye, may be present based on various factors, including ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions. In some populations the trait is almost universal, specifically in East Asians and Southeast Asians, where a majority, up to 90% in some estimations, of adults have this feature.

The upper eyelid crease is a common variation between people of White and East Asian ethnicities. Westerners commonly perceive the East Asian upper eyelid as a &quot;single eyelid&quot;. However, East Asian eyelids are divided into three types – single, low, and double – based on the presence or position of the lid crease. Jeong Sang-ki et al. of Chonnam University, Kwangju, Korea, in a study using both Asian and White cadavers as well as four healthy young Korean men, said that &quot;Asian eyelids&quot; have more fat in them than those of White people. Single/double eyelids are polygenic traits. A 2011 study also states that Saudis of &quot;pure Arab&quot; descent generally have higher upper lid crease and upper lid skin fold heights, compared to other ethnic groups.

In some individuals, an eyelid with excessive skin may push the eyelashes downwards and into the eye, obstructing vision in the case of long and thick lashes, and potentially causing corneal abrasion.
=== Prevalence ===
==Society and culture==

===Cosmetic surgery===
Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure performed to correct deformities and improve or modify the appearance of the eyelids. With 1.43 million people undergoing the procedure in 2014, blepharoplasty is the second most popular cosmetic procedure in the world (Botulinum toxin injection is first), and the most frequently performed cosmetic surgical procedure in the world.

East Asian blepharoplasty, or &quot;double eyelid surgery&quot;, has been reported to be the most common aesthetic procedure in Taiwan and South Korea. Though the procedure is also used to reinforce muscle and tendon tissues surrounding the eye, the operative goal of East Asian blepharoplasty is to remove the adipose and linear tissues underneath and surrounding the eyelids in order to crease the upper eyelid. A procedure to remove the epicanthal fold (i.e. an epicanthoplasty) is often performed in conjunction with an East Asian blepharoplasty.

The use of double sided tape or eyelid glue to create the illusion of creased, or &quot;double&quot; eyelids has become a prominent practice in China and other Asian countries. There is a social pressure for women to have this surgery, and also to use the alternative (taping) practices. Blepharoplasty has become a common surgical operation that is actively encouraged, whilst other kinds of plastic surgery are actively discouraged in Chinese culture.

===Death===
After death, it is common in many cultures to pull the eyelids of the deceased down to close the eyes. This is a typical part of the last offices.

<text>Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method for monitoring blood oxygen saturation. Peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp2) readings are typically within 2% accuracy (within 4% accuracy in 95% of cases) of the more accurate (and invasive) reading of arterial oxygen saturation (Sa2) from arterial blood gas analysis.

A standard pulse oximeter passes two wavelengths of light through tissue to a photodetector. Taking advantage of the pulsate flow of arterial blood, it measures the change in absorbance over the course of a cardiac cycle, allowing it to determine the absorbance due to arterial blood alone, excluding unchanging absorbance due to venous blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and, in many cases, nail polish. The two wavelengths measure the quantities of bound (oxygenated) and unbound (non-oxygenated) hemoglobin, and from their ratio, the percentage of bound hemoglobin is computed.
The most common approach is &quot;transmissive pulse oximetry&quot;. In this approach, one side of a thin part of the patient&#x27;s body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, is illuminated, and the photodetector is on the other side. Fingertips and earlobes have disproportionately high blood flow relative to their size, in order to keep warm, but this will be lacking in hypothermic patients. Other convenient sites include an infant&#x27;s foot or an unconscious patient&#x27;s cheek or tongue.

&quot;Reflectance pulse oximetry&quot; is a less common alternative, placing the photodetector on the same surface as the illumination. This method does not require a thin section of the person&#x27;s body and therefore may be used almost anywhere on the body, such as the forehead, chest, or feet, but it still has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious Sp2 results. Such conditions occur while undergoing anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation or in patients in the Trendelenburg position.

==Medical uses==

A pulse oximeter is a medical device that indirectly monitors the oxygen saturation of a patient&#x27;s blood (as opposed to measuring oxygen saturation directly through a blood sample) and changes in blood volume in the skin, producing a photoplethysmogram that may be further processed into other measurements. The pulse oximeter may be incorporated into a multiparameter patient monitor. Most monitors also display the pulse rate. Portable, battery-operated pulse oximeters are also available for transport or home blood-oxygen monitoring.

===Advantages===
Pulse oximetry is particularly convenient for noninvasive continuous measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In contrast, blood gas levels must otherwise be determined in a laboratory on a drawn blood sample. Pulse oximetry is useful in any setting where a patient&#x27;s oxygenation is unstable, including intensive care, operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, pilots in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient&#x27;s oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental oxygen. Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect hypoventilation is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that abnormalities in respiratory function can be detected reliably with its use. Therefore, the routine administration of supplemental oxygen may be unwarranted if the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation in room air, since it can result in hypoventilation going undetected.

Because of their simplicity of use and the ability to provide continuous and immediate oxygen saturation values, pulse oximeters are of critical importance in emergency medicine and are also very useful for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially COPD, or for diagnosis of some sleep disorders such as apnea and hypopnea. For patients with obstructive sleep apnea, pulse oximetry readings will be in the 70–90% range for much of the time spent attempting to sleep.

Portable battery-operated pulse oximeters are useful for pilots operating in non-pressurized aircraft above or in the U.S. where supplemental oxygen is required. Portable pulse oximeters are also useful for mountain climbers and athletes whose oxygen levels may decrease at high altitudes or with exercise. Some portable pulse oximeters employ software that charts a patient&#x27;s blood oxygen and pulse, serving as a reminder to check blood oxygen levels.

Connectivity advancements have made it possible for patients to have their blood oxygen saturation continuously monitored without a cabled connection to a hospital monitor, without sacrificing the flow of patient data back to bedside monitors and centralized patient surveillance systems.

For patients with COVID-19, pulse oximetry helps with early detection of silent hypoxia, in which the patients still look and feel comfortable, but their Sp2 is dangerously low. This happens to patients either in the hospital or at home. Low Sp2 may indicate severe COVID-19-related pneumonia, requiring a ventilator.

=== Safety ===
Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry is generally considered safe for most patients for up to 8 hours. However, prolonged use in certain types of patients can cause burns due to the heat emitted by the infrared LED, which reaches up to 43°C. Additionally, pulse oximeters occasionally develop electrical faults which causes them to heat up above this temperature. Patients at greater risk include those with delicate or fragile skin, such as infants, particularly premature infants, and the elderly. Additional risks for injury include lack of pain response where the probe is placed, such as having an insensate limb, or being unconscious or under anesthesia, or having communication difficulties. Patients who are at high risk for injury should have the site of their probe moved frequently, i.e. every hour, whereas patients who are at lower risk should have theirs moved every 2-4 hours.

==Limitations==
===Fundamental limitations===
Pulse oximetry solely measures hemoglobin saturation, not ventilation and is not a complete measure of respiratory sufficiency. It is not a substitute for blood gases checked in a laboratory, because it gives no indication of base deficit, carbon dioxide levels, blood pH, or bicarbonate (HCO3−) concentration. The metabolism of oxygen can readily be measured by monitoring expired CO2, but saturation figures give no information about blood oxygen content. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin; in severe anemia, the blood contains less hemoglobin, which despite being saturated cannot carry as much oxygen.

Pulse oximetry also is not a complete measure of circulatory oxygen sufficiency. If there is insufficient bloodflow or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood (anemia), tissues can suffer hypoxia despite high arterial oxygen saturation.

Since pulse oximetry measures only the percentage of bound hemoglobin, a falsely high or falsely low reading will occur when hemoglobin binds to something other than oxygen:
* Hemoglobin has a higher affinity to carbon monoxide than it does to oxygen. Therefore, in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, most hemoglobin might be bound not to oxygen but to carbon monoxide. A pulse oximeter would correctly report most hemoglobin to be bound, but nevertheless the patient would be in a state of hypoxemia and subsequently hypoxia (low cellular oxygen level).
* Cyanide poisoning gives a high reading because it reduces oxygen extraction from arterial blood. In this case, the reading is not false, as arterial blood oxygen is indeed high early in cyanide poisoning: the patient is not hypoxemic, but is hypoxic.
* Methemoglobinemia characteristically causes pulse oximetry readings in the mid-80s.
* COPD [especially chronic bronchitis] may cause false readings.

A noninvasive method that allows continuous measurement of the dyshemoglobins is the pulse CO-oximeter, which was built in 2005 by Masimo. By using additional wavelengths, it provides clinicians a way to measure the dyshemoglobins, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin along with total hemoglobin.

=== Conditions affecting accuracy ===
Because pulse oximeter devices are calibrated for healthy subjects, their accuracy is poor for critically ill patients and preterm newborns. Erroneously low readings may be caused by hypoperfusion of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold or from vasoconstriction secondary to the use of vasopressor agents); incorrect sensor application; highly calloused skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during hypoperfusion. To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or pulse waveform. Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion. Obesity, hypotension (low blood pressure), and some hemoglobin variants can reduce the accuracy of the results. Some home pulse oximeters have low sampling rates, which can significantly underestimate dips in blood oxygen levels.

The accuracy of pulse oximetry deteriorates considerably for readings below 80%. Research has suggested that error rates in common pulse oximeter devices may be higher for adults with dark skin color, leading to claims of encoding systemic racism in countries with multi-racial populations such as the United States. The issue was first identified decades ago; one of the earliest studies on this topic occurred in 1976, which reported reading errors in dark-skinned patients that reflected lower blood oxygen saturation values. Further studies indicate that while accuracy with dark skin is good at higher, healthy saturation levels, some devices overestimate the saturation at lower levels, which may lead to hypoxia not being detected. A study that reviewed thousands of cases of occult hypoxemia, where patients were found to have oxygen saturation below 88% per arterial blood gas measurement despite pulse oximeter readings indicating 92% to 96% oxygen saturation, found that black patients were three times as likely as white patients to have their low oxygen saturation missed by pulse oximeters. Another research study investigated patients in the hospital with COVID-19 and found that occult hypoxemia occurred in 28.5% of black patients compared to only 17.2% of white patients. There has been research to indicate that black COVID-19 patients were 29% less likely to receive supplemental oxygen in a timely manner and three times more likely to have hypoxemia. A further study, which used a MIMIC-IV critical care dataset of both pulse oximeter readings and oxygen saturation levels detected in blood samples, demonstrated that black, Hispanic, and Asian patients had higher Sp2 readings than white patients for a given blood oxygen saturation level measured in blood samples. As a result, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients also received lower rates of supplemental oxygen than white patients. It is suggested that melanin can interfere with the absorption of light used to measure the level of oxygenated blood, often measured from a person&#x27;s finger. Further studies and computer simulations show that the increased amounts of melanin found in people with darker skin scatter the photons of light used by the pulse oximeters, decreasing the accuracy of the measurements. As the studies used to calibrate the devices typically oversample people with lighter skin, the parameters for pulse oximeters are set based on information that is not equitably balanced to account for diverse skin colors. This inaccuracy can lead to potentially missing people who need treatment, as pulse oximetry is used for the screening of sleep apnea and other types of sleep-disordered breathing, which in the United States are conditions more prevalent among minorities. This bias is a significant concern, as a 2% decrease is important for respiratory rehabilitation, studies of sleep apnea, and athletes performing physical efforts; it can lead to severe complications for the patient, requiring an external oxygen supply or even hospitalization.

Another concern regarding pulse oximetry bias is that insurance companies and hospital systems increasingly use these numbers to inform their decisions. Pulse oximetry measurements are used to identify candidates for reimbursement. Similarly, pulse oximetry data is being incorporated into algorithms for clinicians. Early Warning Scores, which provide a record for analyzing a patient&#x27;s clinical status and alerting clinicians if needed, incorporate algorithms with pulse oximetry information and can result in misinformed patient records.

=== Equipment ===

====Consumer pulse oximeters====
In addition to pulse oximeters for professional use, many inexpensive &quot;consumer&quot; models are available. Opinions vary about the reliability of consumer oximeters; a typical comment is &quot;The research data on home monitors has been mixed, but they tend to be accurate within a few percentage points&quot;. Some smart watches with activity tracking incorporate an oximeter function. An article on such devices, in the context of diagnosing COVID-19 infection, quoted João Paulo Cunha of the University of Porto, Portugal: &quot;these sensors are not precise, that&#x27;s the main limitation ... the ones that you wear are only for the consumer level, not for the clinical level&quot;. Pulse oximeters used for diagnosis of conditions such as COVID-19 should be Class IIB medical grade oximeters. Class IIB oximeters can be used on patients of all skin colors, low pigmentation and in the presence of motion. When a pulse oximeter is shared between two patients, to prevent cross-infection it should be cleaned with alcohol wipes after each use or a disposable probe or finger cover should be used.

According to a report by iData Research, the US pulse oximetry monitoring market for equipment and sensors was over $700 million in 2011.

====Mobile apps====
Mobile app pulse oximeters use the flashlight and the camera of the phone, instead of infrared light used in conventional pulse oximeters. However, apps do not generate as accurate readings because the camera cannot measure the light reflection at two wavelengths, so the oxygen saturation readings that are obtained through an app on a smartphone are inconsistent for clinical use. At least one study has suggested these are not reliable relative to clinical pulse oximeters.

==Mechanism==

A blood-oxygen monitor displays the percentage of blood that is loaded with oxygen. More specifically, it uses light spectrometry to measure what percentage of hemoglobin, the protein in blood that carries oxygen, is loaded. Acceptable normal Sa2 ranges for patients without pulmonary pathology are from 95 to 99 percent. For a person breathing room air at or near sea level, an estimate of arterial pO2 can be made from the blood-oxygen monitor &quot;saturation of peripheral oxygen&quot; (Sp2) reading.

===Mode of operation===
A typical pulse oximeter uses an electronic processor and a pair of small light-emitting diodes (LEDs) facing a photodiode through a translucent part of the patient&#x27;s body, usually a fingertip or an earlobe. One LED is red, with wavelength of 660 nm, and the other is infrared with a wavelength of 940 nm. Absorption of light at these wavelengths differs significantly between blood loaded with oxygen and blood lacking oxygen. Oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs more infrared light and allows more red light to pass through. Deoxygenated hemoglobin allows more infrared light to pass through and absorbs more red light. The LEDs sequence through their cycle of one on, then the other, then both off about thirty times per second which allows the photodiode to respond to the red and infrared light separately and also adjust for the ambient light baseline.

The amount of light that is transmitted (in other words, that is not absorbed) is measured, and separate normalized signals are produced for each wavelength. These signals fluctuate in time because the amount of arterial blood that is present increases (literally pulses) with each heartbeat. By subtracting the minimum transmitted light from the transmitted light in each wavelength, the effects of other tissues are corrected for, generating a continuous signal for pulsatile arterial blood. The ratio of the red light measurement to the infrared light measurement is then calculated by the processor (which represents the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin to deoxygenated hemoglobin), and this ratio is then converted to Sp2 by the processor via a lookup table based on the Beer–Lambert law. The signal separation also serves other purposes: a plethysmograph waveform (&quot;pleth wave&quot;) representing the pulsatile signal is usually displayed for a visual indication of the pulses as well as signal quality, and a numeric ratio between the pulsatile and baseline absorbance (&quot;perfusion index&quot;) can be used to evaluate perfusion.

===Derived measurements===
{{see also|Photoplethysmogram}}
Due to changes in blood volumes in the skin, a plethysmographic variation can be seen in the light signal received (transmittance) by the sensor on an oximeter. The variation can be described as a periodic function, which in turn can be split into a DC component (the peak value){{efn|This definition used by Masimo varies from the mean value used in signal processing; it is meant to measure the pulsatile arterial blood absorbance over the baseline absorbance.}} and an AC component (peak minus trough). The ratio of the AC component to the DC component, expressed as a percentage, is known as the (peripheral) perfusion index (Pi) for a pulse, and typically has a range of 0.02% to 20%. An earlier measurement called the pulse oximetry plethysmographic (POP) only measures the &quot;AC&quot; component, and is derived manually from monitor pixels.

Pleth variability index (PVI) is a measure of the variability of the perfusion index, which occurs during breathing cycles. Mathematically it is calculated as {{math|(Pimax − Pimin)/Pimax × 100%}}, where the maximum and minimum Pi values are from one or many breathing cycles. It has been shown to be a useful, noninvasive indicator of continuous fluid responsiveness for patients undergoing fluid management. Pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (ΔPOP) is an analogous earlier technique for use on the manually-derived POP, calculated as {{math|(POPmax − POPmin)/(POPmax + POPmin)×2}}.

==History==
In 1935, German physician Karl Matthes (1905–1962) developed the first two-wavelength ear O2 saturation meter with red and green filters (later red and infrared filters). It was the first device to measure O2 saturation.

The original oximeter was made by Glenn Allan Millikan in the 1940s. In 1943 and as published in 1949, Earl Wood added a pressure capsule to squeeze blood out of the ear so as to obtain an absolute O2 saturation value when blood was readmitted. The concept is similar to today&#x27;s conventional pulse oximetry, but was difficult to implement because of unstable photocells and light sources; today this method is not used clinically. In 1964 Shaw assembled the first absolute reading ear oximeter, which used eight wavelengths of light.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

The first pulse oximeter was developed in 1972 by Japanese bioengineers Takuo Aoyagi and Michio Kishi at Japanese medical electronic equipment manufacturer Nihon Kohden, using the ratio of red to infrared light absorption of pulsating components at the measuring site. Nihon Kohden manufactured the first pulse oximeter, Ear Oximeter OLV-5100. Surgeon Susumu Nakajima and his associates first tested the device in patients, reporting it in 1975. However, Nihon Kohden suspended the development of pulse oximetry and did not apply for a basic patent of pulse oximetry except in Japan, which facilitated further development and utilization of pulse oximetry later in U.S. In 1977, Minolta commercialized the first finger pulse oximeter OXIMET MET-1471. In the U.S., the first pulse oximeter was commercialized by Biox in 1980, followed later by Nellcor in 1983.

By 1987, the standard of care for the administration of a general anesthetic in the U.S. included pulse oximetry. From the operating room, the use of pulse oximetry rapidly spread throughout the hospital, first to recovery rooms, and then to intensive care units. Pulse oximetry was of particular value in the neonatal unit where the patients do not thrive with inadequate oxygenation, but too much oxygen and fluctuations in oxygen concentration can lead to vision impairment or blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Furthermore, obtaining an arterial blood gas from a neonatal patient is painful to the patient and a major cause of neonatal anemia. Motion artifact can be a significant limitation to pulse oximetry monitoring, resulting in frequent false alarms and loss of data. This is because during motion and low peripheral perfusion, many pulse oximeters cannot distinguish between pulsating arterial blood and moving venous blood, leading to underestimation of oxygen saturation. Early studies of pulse oximetry performance during subject motion made clear the vulnerabilities of conventional pulse oximetry technologies to motion artifact.

In 1995, Masimo introduced Signal Extraction Technology (SET) that could measure accurately during patient motion and low perfusion by separating the arterial signal from the venous and other signals. Since then, pulse oximetry manufacturers have developed new algorithms to reduce some false alarms during motion, such as extending averaging times or freezing values on the screen, but they do not claim to measure changing conditions during motion and low perfusion. So there are still important differences in performance of pulse oximeters during challenging conditions. Also in 1995, Masimo introduced perfusion index, quantifying the amplitude of the peripheral plethysmograph waveform. Perfusion index has been shown to help clinicians predict illness severity and early adverse respiratory outcomes in neonates, predict low superior vena cava flow in very low birth weight infants, provide an early indicator of sympathectomy after epidural anesthesia, and improve detection of critical congenital heart disease in newborns.

Published papers have compared signal extraction technology to other pulse oximetry technologies and have demonstrated consistently favorable results for signal extraction technology. Signal extraction technology pulse oximetry performance has also been shown to translate into helping clinicians improve patient outcomes. In one study, retinopathy of prematurity (eye damage) was reduced by 58% in very low birth weight neonates at a center using signal extraction technology, while there was no decrease in retinopathy of prematurity at another center with the same clinicians using the same protocol but with non-signal extraction technology. Other studies have shown that signal extraction technology pulse oximetry results in fewer arterial blood gas measurements, faster oxygen weaning time, lower sensor utilization, and lower length of stay. The measure-through motion and low perfusion capabilities it has also allow it to be used in previously unmonitored areas such as the general floor, where false alarms have plagued conventional pulse oximetry. As evidence of this, a landmark study was published in 2010 showing that clinicians at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center using signal extraction technology pulse oximetry on the general floor were able to decrease rapid response team activations, ICU transfers, and ICU days. In 2020, a follow-up retrospective study at the same institution showed that over ten years of using pulse oximetry with signal extraction technology, coupled with a patient surveillance system, there were zero patient deaths and no patients were harmed by opioid-induced respiratory depression while continuous monitoring was in use.

In 2007, Masimo introduced the first measurement of the pleth variability index (PVI), which multiple clinical studies have shown provides a new method for automatic, noninvasive assessment of a patient&#x27;s ability to respond to fluid administration. Appropriate fluid levels are vital to reducing postoperative risks and improving patient outcomes: fluid volumes that are too low (under-hydration) or too high (over-hydration) have been shown to decrease wound healing and increase the risk of infection or cardiac complications. Recently, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and the French Anesthesia and Critical Care Society listed PVI monitoring as part of their suggested strategies for intra-operative fluid management.

In 2011, an expert workgroup recommended newborn screening with pulse oximetry to increase the detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). The CCHD workgroup cited the results of two large, prospective studies of 59,876 subjects that exclusively used signal extraction technology to increase the identification of CCHD with minimal false positives. The CCHD workgroup recommended newborn screening be performed with motion tolerant pulse oximetry that has also been validated in low perfusion conditions. In 2011, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services added pulse oximetry to the recommended uniform screening panel. Before the evidence for screening using signal extraction technology, less than 1% of newborns in the United States were screened. Today, The Newborn Foundation has documented near universal screening in the United States and international screening is rapidly expanding. In 2014, a third large study of 122,738 newborns that also exclusively used signal extraction technology showed similar, positive results as the first two large studies.

High-resolution pulse oximetry (HRPO) has been developed for in-home sleep apnea screening and testing in patients for whom it is impractical to perform polysomnography. It stores and records both pulse rate and Sp2 in 1 second intervals and has been shown in one study to help to detect sleep disordered breathing in surgical patients.

<text>Taivassalo (; ) is a municipality of Finland, about from the city of Turku. It is located in the Southwest Finland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The municipality is unilingually Finnish. Its neighboring municipalities are Kustavi, Masku, Mynämäki, Naantali, Uusikaupunki and Vehmaa.

The medieval sailing ship appearing in the coat of arms of Taivassalo refers to the maritime connections the coastguard already had during the Northern Crusades, as well as to the medieval naval weaponry, the surviving information of which comes from Taivassalo itself. The coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson, and the Taivassalo municipal council approved it at its meeting on October 21, 1953. The Ministry of the Interior approved the coat of arms for use on February 11, 1954.

== Name ==
&quot;Taivassalo&quot; literally means &quot;sky island&quot;, however J. A. Lopmeri and Elias Lönnrot theorized that the initial word was originally &quot;taival/taipale&quot;, as the area was originally an island, by the time of the naming it may have been connected to the mainland by a thin isthmus (&quot;taipale&quot;) as a result of post-glacial rebound. The Swedish name &quot;Tövsala&quot; is an adaptation of the Finnish name.

== History ==
Taivassalo was first mentioned in 1350 as &quot;Thowesalu&quot;, when it was already a separate parish. It also included Velkua, Kustavi (originally &quot;Kivimaa&quot;) and Iniö until the 19th century.

<text>Ekenäs (; ) is a town and former municipality in Finland that comprised the former municipalities of Snappertuna and Tenala together with the town of Ekenäs. It was merged with Pohja and Karis to form the new municipality of Raseborg on January 1, 2009. Ekenäs is in the province of Southern Finland, and is part of the Uusimaa () region.

The town is bilingual, with the majority being Swedish speakers (81%), and the minority Finnish speakers (17%).

==History==
Ekenäs is Finland&#x27;s seventh oldest town and the first of the non-medieval towns. King Gustav Wasa granted town rights to Ekenäs on 15 December 1546, but even before that Ekenäs played a significant role in maritime transport. Today it is mostly noted for its archipelago, part of which is the Ekenäs Archipelago National Park. The old, mainly wooden town center is protected due to its cultural historical value, and renovation of even residential buildings is strictly controlled. The history of the old town dates back to 16th century, but most of the current buildings have been built between 18th and 19th century. 

The present Neoclassical form of the Ekenäs church was designed by Italian-born architect Charles Bassi in 1839–1842 following a fire in 1821. There are two buildings in Ekenäs designed by world famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto; the Ekenäs Savings Bank (1964) and Villa Skeppet (1969), the home of Aalto&#x27;s biographer, Göran Schildt.

Ekenäs is home of the oldest still functional movie theatre in Finland called &quot;Bio Forum&quot;. The theatre is located in the old town centre in a small Art Nouveau (Jugend) building and it was founded in 1912. At the time it was called &quot;Ekenäs Nya Biograf Teater&quot;.

==Notable people==
Among notable residents are author Marianne Alopaeus, who wrote in Swedish. She was born in Ekenäs in 1918. One of the most renowned finnish modernist painters Helene Schjerfbeck spend her summers 1918-1920 in Ekenäs and lived in the town permanently 1925-1941. Ekenäs museum center Ekta has a permanent exhibition of her work called &quot;Helene Schjerfbeck&#x27;s Life and Art&quot;.

Emma Engdahl-Jägerskiöld, one of Finland&#x27;s first internationally-recognised opera singers grew up in, and always retained a close connection with, Ekenäs.

Kaija Saarikettu, violinist and Professor at Sibelius Academy, was born in Ekenäs.

== Attractions ==

Every year Christmas Markets and Christmas opening are organized on the wooden house idyll, pedestrian street Kungsgatan and the market square. 

Ekenäs has an award winning art museum Chappe - an art house by the Sea.

<text>An Electress (, ) was the of a Prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire, one of the Empire&#x27;s greatest princes.

The Golden Bull of 1356 established by Emperor Charles IV settled the number of Electors at seven. However, three of these were Roman Catholic archbishops, and so had no consorts; while of the four secular Electors, one was King of Bohemia, and his consort was always known by the more prestigious title of &quot;Queen of Bohemia&quot;. The consorts usually referred to as Electresses, therefore, were:

* The Electress of the Palatinate;
* The Electress of Saxony;
* The Electress of Brandenburg.

To these were added, in 1623 and 1692 respectively:
* The Electress of Bavaria;
* The Electress of Hanover.

In the final years of the Empire, several Electors were added, who only held their offices for less than three years before the Empire&#x27;s final dissolution. The consorts of these last Electors were:
* The Electress of Württemberg;
* The Electress of Hesse-Kassel.

There was also an Elector of Baden, but the only ruler to use this title was married morganatically and so his spouse did not share his title.

The rulers of Hesse-Kassel continued to use the title of &quot;Elector&quot; until the annexation of the principality by Prussia in 1866.

Persons using or entitled to use the title of &quot;Electress&quot; are listed below. Spouses of Electors in morganatic or unequal marriages are given in a separate table at the bottom of the page.

<doc id="784686" wikidata="Q7099168" url="?curid=784686" title="Or Adonai">
<text>Or Adonai (Hebrew: אור אֲדֹנָי), The Light of the Lord, is the primary work of Rabbi Hasdai Crescas (c. 1340 - 1410/1411), a Jewish philosopher. As some Jews prefer to not use even the respectful title &quot;Adonai&quot; (Lord) other than in prayer (see names of God in Judaism), the book is sometimes called Or Hashem (אור השם) in verbal usage to avoid mentioning even this title of God directly.

A partial translation of Crescas was produced by Harry Austryn Wolfson of Harvard University in 1929.

== Purpose of the work ==

In the early medieval era there had been a tendency for some Jewish religious rationalists to reinterpret classical Jewish theology in the light of then-current philosophy, specifically neo-Aristotelian rationalism. This was the program of Jewish rationalist philosophers such as Saadia Gaon, Maimonides (who was influenced by Ibn Sina aka Avicenna), and Gersonides (who was influenced by Ibn Roshd, aka Averroes). In the view of Crescas, this point of view often led to mistaken conclusions, and threatened to blur the distinctiveness of the Jewish faith. He felt that this program reduced the doctrinal contents of Judaism to a surrogate of Aristotelian concepts.

Crescas makes no concealment of his purpose to vindicate classical Jewish thinking against the rationalism of Maimonides and Gersonides. Of these two the former especially had endeavored to harmonize revelation and faith with philosophy. While, in those instances where this harmony could not be established, Maimonides refused to follow Aristotle to the exclusion of Moses, his successors seemed bent upon the opposite course. For them philosophical rationalism was superior to classical religious thinking.

Crescas met the medieval rationalists as a philosopher who recognized the right of philosophical speculation. He did not agree with those Christian and Muslim theologians who in their speculations were advocates of a twofold truth, one for the theologian and the other for the philosopher, the former not cognizable by natural man, because supernatural and irrational, the latter open to the intelligence of natural man.

Crescas attempted to show that Aristotelian rationalism was far from infallible. In this, he is a precursor of Baruch Spinoza. Crescas deplores the fact that Maimonides, whose scholarship and honesty he otherwise admires, seemed to make Greek philosophy the basis for Jewish doctrine.

After attempting to show the untenability of the Aristotelian propositions, Crescas attempted to &quot;establish the roots and the cornerstones upon which the Torah (i.e. Jewish religion) is propped, and the pivots upon which it turns&quot; (from the preface.)

Crescas does not denounce heretics, but rather exposes the weakness of the ground on which those views he considers to be heterodox rest. He desires to set forth the contents of Judaism and the limitations in respect to them of the scope of philosophy. His book comprises four main divisions (&quot;ma&#x27;amar&quot;), subdivided into &quot;kelalim&quot; and chapters (&quot;perakim&quot;): the first treating of the foundation of all belief—the existence of God; the second, of the fundamental doctrines of the faith; the third, of other doctrines which, though not fundamental, are binding on every adherent of Judaism; the fourth, of doctrines which, though traditional, are without obligatory character, and which are open to philosophical construction.

== The first cause ==

The first main division opens with a thorough criticism of the twenty-five (or twenty-six) Aristotelian propositions (&quot;hakdamot&quot;) which Maimonides accepts as axiomatic and out of which he constructs his idea of God.

In the first section he presents all the demonstrations for these theorems, especially those adduced by Tabrizi; in the second, he shows the inadequacy of many of these ontological and physical propositions, and thus demolishes Maimonides&#x27; proofs for his God-concept. Crescas, admitting that the existence of a first cause is susceptible of philosophic proof, but only by contingence (he rejects the Aristotelian assumption that an endless chain of causes is unthinkable; i.e., the first cause of all that is must be regarded as existent), holds philosophy to be incompetent to prove God&#x27;s absolute unity, as does Ghazzali.

The first cause may be philosophically construed to be simple, for if it were composite another would have to be assumed for the compounding. Still, this would not necessitate the positing of God&#x27;s unity. Other deities might with other functions still be in existence, even if our God were thought to be omnipotent. Therefore revelation alone is competent to establish God&#x27;s unity. Without the creed of Shema Yisrael (&quot;Hear, O Israel&quot;) philosophy fails to be a trusty guide.

Crescas introduces a new element into his idea of God. His predecessors contended that God&#x27;s highest happiness, the divine essence, was God&#x27;s own knowledge. Crescas rejects this as inadequate, and posits instead God&#x27;s love, always intent upon communicating itself and doing good. He argues against Maimonides for the admissibility of divine attributes. From the human subjective point of view, attributes may appear to posit differences in God; but this does not mean that they do so in God objectively. In God, in the Absolutely Good, they merge as identical unity; predicates, especially of only logical or conceptual significance, are incompetent to cause real multiplicity or composition.

The knowledge of God is thus in every moment of existence: this can give us knowing about all things happen in the World, i.e. Providence; this can be the virtue of the best and higher wise man who is knowing on will and thinking of God. Wisdom and knowledge of providence may be the quality of &quot;right-man&quot;, that in the Torah is the figure of sage, prophet and Tzaddik. Hasdai Crescas gives a vision about the providence of God also with Torah:

The sages of Israel teach that the &quot;good&quot; is from God, the King of Heaven and the Creator of the World He governs with providence, that is for the Avodah, the Temple of Jerusalem...&quot;Sion&quot; where Abraham, Yitzchak and Yakov find their eternal Brit with God.

== Six fundamental doctrines ==

In the second division Crescas enumerates six fundamental doctrines as presupposed by revealed faith, without which he believes Judaism would fall: God&#x27;s omniscience, providence, and omnipotence; the belief in prophecy, Free will, and that the world was created for a purpose.

God&#x27;s omniscience embraces all the innumerable individual beings; God has knowledge of what is as yet not in existence; God knows what of all possibilities will happen, though thereby the nature of the possible is not altered. God&#x27;s knowledge is different from that of man: inferences from one to the other are not valid. (Here he sides with Maimonides against Gersonides.)

God&#x27;s providence embraces directly and indirectly all species and individuals. It rewards and punishes, especially in the hereafter. Crescas rejects the theories of Maimonides and Gersonides on this point. Love, not knowledge (intellectual), is the bond between God and man. From God&#x27;s love proceeds only what is good, and punishment is also inherently good. God&#x27;s omnipotence is not merely infinite in time, but also in intensity.

Revelation, and it alone (&quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot;), makes it clear. Natural law is no limitation for God, but whatever is irrational proves neither God&#x27;s omnipotence nor His lack of power; that is, God acts reasonably.

Prophecy is the highest degree of human mentality. Maimonides makes it dependent upon certain conditions. While Crescas admits this, he differs from Maimonides in that he will not admit the refusal of the prophetic gift when these conditions are fulfilled. Connection and communion with God are not brought about by knowledge, but by love and reverence, leading us to God if we keep His commandments.

Very extensive is Crescas&#x27;s presentation of the freedom of the will. He inclines toward its rejection; at all events, to its limitation. The law of causality is so all-pervasive that human conduct can not withdraw itself from its operations. Moreover, God&#x27;s omniscience anticipates our resolutions. But the Torah teaches the freedom of choice and presupposes our self-determination. Thus he concludes that the human will is free in certain respects, but determined in others. Will operates as a free agent when considered alone, but when regarded in relation to the remote cause, it acts by necessity; or, will operates in freedom, both per se and in regard to the provoking cause, but is bound if analyzed with reference to the divine omniscience. Man feels himself free; therefore he is responsible and must be rewarded or punished. The accompanying sentiment (readiness or disinclination to act) makes the deed our own.

== Purpose of the world ==

Maimonides rejected as futile and unwarranted all inquiry into the ultimate purpose of the world. Crescas posits such an ultimate purpose and assumes it to be the happiness of the soul. In this life the soul is intently striving after union with the divine; the laws of the Torah help to realize this, the soul&#x27;s, never quiescent yearning. After death, the soul will enter upon greater possibilities of love, in the higher existence. Former thinkers made immortality depend on knowledge. Crescas believed that this was contrary to the teachings of religion, and also utterly unreasonable. Love, for Crescas, brings about the soul&#x27;s happiness of eternal duration in the hereafter and the communion with God thereupon ensuing. &quot;The soul is the form and essence of man, a subtle spiritual substance, capacitated for knowledge, but in its substance not yet cognizant.&quot;

By this definition Crescas attempts to establish the soul&#x27;s independence of knowledge. Knowledge does not produce the soul. Man&#x27;s highest perfection is not attained through knowledge, but principally through love, the tendency to, and longing for, the fountainhead of all good. Man&#x27;s last purpose, his highest good, is love, manifested in obedience to God&#x27;s laws. God&#x27;s highest purpose is to make man participate in the eternal bliss to come.

The third main division devotes much attention to the theories concerning Creation. Whatever theory, however, be accepted, the belief in miracles and revelation is not affected. Religious tradition is so preponderatingly in favor of the assumption that the world and matter are created, and Gersonides&#x27; counter-reasoning is so inconclusive, that Crescas regards the denial of creation as heterodox. Immortality, punishment, reward, resurrection (a miracle, but not irrational), the irrevocability and eternal obligation of the Law, the belief in urim and thummim and Messianic redemption, are the other tenets treated as doctrines which should be accepted, but which are not strictly speaking, basic.

In the fourth division thirteen opinions are enumerated as open to speculative decision, among them the questions concerning the dissolution of the world. (Crescas holds the earth will pass away while the heavens will endure.) Have there been other worlds besides our own? Are the heavenly bodies endowed with soul and reason? Have amulets and incantations any significance? What are the &quot;Shedim&quot;? What about metempsychosis?

An opponent of Maimonides on philosophical grounds, Crescas was also dissatisfied with the method of Maimonides law code, the &quot;Mishneh Torah,&quot;. This was due to its absence of indications of the sources, the rare mention of divergent opinions, and the lack of provision to meet new cases, owing to its neglect to establish general principles of universal application (&quot;Or Adonai,&quot; Preface).

If among Jews he exercised for a long time only through Joseph Albo any perceptible influence, though he was studied, for instance, by Don Isaac Abravanel, who controverts especially his Messianic theories, and by Abram Shalom in his &quot;Neveh Shalom&quot;, Crescas&#x27; work was of prime and fundamental importance through the part it had in the shaping of Baruch Spinoza&#x27;s system. Spinoza&#x27;s distinction between attributes and properties is identical with Crescas&#x27; distinction between attributes subjectively ascribed and their objective reality in God. The connection between Spinoza&#x27;s views on creation and free will, on love of God and of others, and those of Crescas has been established by Joël in his &quot;Zur Genesis der Lehre Spinoza&#x27;s&quot; (Breslau, 1871).

== Seven principles ==

Hasdai Crescas teaches that there is the way of Torah to do with perfect view all Mitzvot, that is the service of all religious. All this is to obtain the “end of Torah”: good, love and joy. Seven principles are the divine necessity.

== Eschatology ==

Ample space is then given to the end of the World, that is to the end of the universe which could dissolve into nothingness; the world (the creation and “creatures”, i.e. humankind, animals and Nature) is finite precisely because matter isn’t spiritual while spirituality falls within the scope of eternal life: the soul and body (earth in hebrew “Adamà” and Adam is the first man who is created by God from the four types of dust in the world, that is from North, South, East and West… “Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris“, so Adam in rabbinic literature is the correlation between spirit and matter). God created the World with mercy and grace and the Chakhamim, Jewish sages, deduced that God could create other worlds after the end of this one while still with the doubt whether this could persist eternally: in &quot;Or Hashem&quot; or “Or Adonai” and in Jewish liturgical song “Adon Olam” the end of world is mentioned, all this without reference about Olam HaBa that is true also for them in their jewish theology:
