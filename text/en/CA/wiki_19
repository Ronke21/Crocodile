<text>The Kru, Krao, Kroo, or Krou are a West African ethnic group who are indigenous to western Ivory Coast and eastern Liberia. European and American writers often called Kru men who enlisted as sailors or mariners Krumen. They migrated and settled along various points of the West African coast, notably Freetown, Sierra Leone, but also the Ivorian and Nigerian coasts. The Kru-speaking people are a large ethnic group that is made up of several sub-ethnic groups in Liberia and Ivory Coast. In Liberia, there are 48 sub-sections of Kru tribes, including the Jlao Kru. These tribes include Bété, Bassa, Krumen, Guéré, Grebo, Klao/Krao, Dida, Krahn people and Jabo people.

==History==
During the Atlantic slave trade, Kru people were considered more valuable as traders and sailors on slave ships than as slave labor, and Kru oral traditions strongly hold that they were never enslaved. To ensure their status as “freemen,” they initiated the practice of tattooing their foreheads and the bridge of their nose with indigo dye to distinguish them from slave labor. Many were called Krumen by Europeans, and hired as free sailors on European ships in both the slave trade and trade in goods. The Kru sailors were famous for their skills in navigating and sailing the Atlantic. Their maritime expertise evolved along the west coast of Africa where they made a living as fishermen and traders. Knowing the in-shore waters of the western coast of Africa, and having nautical experience, they were employed as sailors, navigators and interpreters aboard slave ships, trading ships, and American and British warships used against the slave trade.

The Kru history is one marked by a strong sense of ethnicity and resistance to occupation. In 1856 when part of Liberia was still known as the independent Republic of Maryland, the Kru along with the Grebo resisted Maryland settlers&#x27; efforts to control their trade. They were also infamous amongst early European slave raiders as being especially resistant to the slave trade.

This resistance included the Kru Revolt of 1915 which saw many Kru killed by American and Liberian reprisals.

===Origins===
Oral tradition remains the most important key to the origin of the Kru. Traditions recorded in the mid nineteenth century by James Connelly relate that the Kru communities that lived along the shore of what is today southern Liberia and the reputed core settlement of the Kru came down to the coast from the interior &quot;some three generations back — say one hundred to one hundred fifty years...&quot; from an original place he called Claho. Coming down the Poor River they &quot;learned the value of salt&quot; and founded the town of Bassa. They subsequently moved again to Little Kroo, and then were subsequently joined by more Kru-speaking communities from the interior. These events likely occurred in the 18th century and are believed to be connected to more intensive European interest in trade in the region at this time. The original settlers from the interior eventually established five towns: Little Kroo, Setra Kroo, Kroo-Bar, Nana Kroo and King Will&#x27;s Town, that came to be regarded as their home district, though soon other offshoots developed along the coast, and particularly in Freetown, Sierra Leone. However, these accounts are often biased because of Europeans&#x27; lack of understanding the Kru language; for example, the term &quot;Bar&quot; or &quot;bah&quot; would signify a river mouth, rather than the proper name of a town. The towns listed by European and American authors are often Anglicized; Settra Kru&#x27;s name in the Klao language is actually Welteh. Many debates over Kru origins and settlement persist today, including the oft-cited origin of the Kru name as originating in a ship&#x27;s &quot;crew.&quot; In actuality, the title &quot;Kru&quot; comes from an Anglicized version of the Kru term for their own tribe: Klao.

===Seafaring===
From the late eighteenth century onward, Kru men (from whence the term Krumen derives) began working on European ships. By the 1790s the inhabitants of their original region were being hired as free sailors on European ships. As the so-called &quot;legitimate trade&quot; replaced the slave trade in the nineteenth century and as trade along the West Africa coast increased, many Kru sailors signed on to the new vessels as seamen. In the process there developed Kru communities around all the major trading factories of the coast, from Sierra Leone around to the mouth of the Congo River.

A number of Kroomen (between 20 and 30) are buried in the Seaforth Old Burial Ground in Simon&#x27;s Town, South Africa, where their graves can still be seen, and Kroomen is the name used to describe them on their gravestones. They were active in the Royal Navy from 1820 to as late as 1924; for example, landed a camp party with 12 Krumen in Elephant Bay in June of that year. Many Kroomen joined the dockyard staff, while others remained on board RN ships as seamen. They were given Westernized or diminutive names by the men on the ships, Tom Ropeman, Bottle of Beer, and Will Cockroach amongst them. They were clearly commonly employed, and the names bestowed were not original, since the cemetery contains for example the remains of Tom Smith Number 1, to distinguish him from another Tom Smith.

Kru sailors were organized as small companies under a headman. They would paddle in small canoes as far as a dozen miles out to see to meet ships as they arrived and negotiated their employment on the spot. Headmen often carried credentials from previous stints of employment in boxes or other containers, and negotiations were conducted rapidly. During the earlier part of the nineteenth century foreign observers often gave the Kru high praise for their honesty, courage, efficiency and willingness to do hard work. Later observers, however, had more disparaging comments to make, though either way, few ships plied African waters without many Kru sailors on board.

Although initially Kru men were interested only in sailor&#x27;s work, in time some took up land based employment doing all sorts of work in the many trading factories that grew up all along the African coast from Sierra Leone to the mouth of the Congo River. They were also recruited as soldiers and common laborers, some traveling as far as India and the Malayan peninsula to the east. Krumen workers served French employers in the French attempt to dig the Panama Canal, others were employed in Jamaica. Others formed communities in the UK, like the Kru town in Liverpool.

===Culture===
In the late nineteenth century, reports described the Kru as divided into small commonwealths, each with a hereditary chief whose duty was simply to represent the people in their dealings with strangers. This remains the case in many enclaves today. Power was vested in the elders, who wore as insignia iron rings on their legs. Their president, who held religious authority as well, guarded the national symbols, and his house was sanctuary for offenders until their guilt is proved. Personal property was held in common by each family. Land also was communal, but the rights of the actual cultivator ceased when he failed to farm it.

===Religion===
The first descriptions of core group of Kru religion were done by missionaries, notably James Connolley, But these accounts can also be augmented by more detailed accounts of the Grebo of nearby Cape Palmas who were linguistically and culturally related. The central elements of the spiritual universe of this region included a figure identified by missionaries as a high, creator God, named Nyesoa, spirits or deities associated with territories, familial spiritual guardians or the souls of the departed who remained near by and could influence events.

In some areas of Liberia, these spiritual entities were contacted through a class of people called &quot;deya&quot;, who underwent long and specialized training and apprenticeship to take up their office. They addressed problems both medical and spiritual using pharmaceutical and spiritual remedies.

===Kru language===

Wilhelm Bleek classified the Kru language with the Mandingo family, and in this he was followed by R. G. Latham; S. W. Koelle, who published a Kru grammar (1854), disagreed. Now Kru is considered a primary branch of the Niger-Congo family.

==Distribution==

The Kru are one of the many ethnic groups in Liberia, comprising 7% of the population. Theirs is also one of the main languages spoken. The Kru are one of the main indigenous group players in Liberia&#x27;s socio-political activities.

==Notable people==
Notable ethnic Krus include the 25th President of Liberia George Weah, who is of mixed Kru, Gbee, Mano, and Bassa heritage, as well as his predecessor, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is of mixed Kru, Gola, and German ancestry. Dr. George Toe Washington, former Armed Forces Chief of Staff of Liberia and ambassador to the United States, Canada, and Mexic, is of Kru and Grebo ancestry. Football star William Jebor is exclusively of Kru background. Mary Broh, the former mayor of Monrovia, is of mixed Kru and Bassa ancestry. And Didwho Twe, a judge and politician who ran for President of Liberia in 1951, was of Kru heritage.

<text>Duke William of Württemberg (; 20 July 1828 – 5 November 1896) was an Austrian and Württemberg General.

==Early life and family==
Duke William was born at Carlsruhe, Kingdom of Prussia (now Pokój, Poland) was the first child of Duke Eugen of Württemberg (1788–1857, son of Duke Eugen of Württemberg and Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern) by his second marriage to Princess Helene of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1807–1880, daughter of Charles Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Countess Amalie Henriette of Solms-Baruth). William had three half-siblings from his father&#x27;s previous marriage with Princess Mathilde of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He was the first member of the House of Württemberg to attend a public high school in Breslau.

==Military career==

===War service===
After studying in Geneva and Bonn, he joined the Austrian Army in 1848 as a lieutenant for Infantry Regiment Kaiser Franz Joseph No. 1 in Vienna. During the First Italian War of Independence (1848–1849) he was wounded several times. In recognition of his bravery, Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz promoted him to captain in the infantry regiment No. 45.

In 1853 he became major, between 1857 and 1859 colonel lieutenant, and colonel and commander of the infantry regiment No. 27 King of the Belgians. He fought also at the Second Italian War of Independence (1859). At the Battle of Magenta, he impressed both his superiors, Major General Wilhelm Ramming and Field Marshal Lieutenant Eduard Clam-Gallas and his opponents. The French generals Gustave Lannes de Montebello and Pierre Louis Charles de Failly mentioned this a few weeks later in a meeting against the Field Marshal Lieutenant Prince of Hesse.

In 1866 he took part in the Austro-Prussian War as a major general, his brigade was assigned to the Northern Army and fought in the Battles of Königgrätz, Swiepwalde, Blumenau and Bratislava.

After the campaign, he arrived with his brigade in Trieste, in 1869 he was made commander of 11th Infantry Division troops in Prague and on 24 October 1869 he was promoted to lieutenant field marshal. During the Franco-Prussian War William fought on the German side against France. He also fought in the Russian-Turkish war in 1878.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
In 1878, during the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he fought (again on the Austrian side) at Rogelj and Jajce. Due to his excellent performances, Emperor Franz Joseph I appointed him Feldzeugmeister and commanding general of the 18th Army Corps. His task was to submit to the west and bring peace to Bosnia. In 1878 he was commissioned to organize the newly established Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina militarily and politically. He served as Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1878 to 1881.

He developed the military and economic interests to be taken into account plan, a large number of communication routes. The school system, especially the militarily organized Knabenpensionat in Sarajevo, developed in a short time, as well as all other branches of administration and justice.

===Later years===
In 1883 William was the commanding general of the XI. Corps in Lemberg. In 1889 he became commander of the 3rd Armeekorps in Graz. In 1891 he retired from the military because of the death of King Charles I of Württemberg. As the late king&#x27;s successor William II had no son, William became the heir presumptive to the throne of Württemberg.

William was Württemberg General of the Infantry à la suite of the &quot;Grenadier Regiment &quot;King Karl&quot; (5 Wurttemberg) No. 123&quot; and the Royal Colonel of the Prussian &quot;Infantry Regiment of Herwarth Bittenfeld (1st Westphalian) No. 13&quot;.

As a member of the House of Württemberg, he was a member of the Estates of Württemberg.

==Death==
William died unmarried and without issue. The consequences of war injuries and a car accident in Italy affected his health. He died during a vacation in Tyrol.

<text>Pop Artificielle is a 1998 album by &quot;lb&quot; (which refers to &quot;Lassigue Bendthaus&quot;, one of the many aliases of musician Uwe Schmidt). All of the songs are covers of pop songs from the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. The entire album, as the title implies, is designed to sound very synthetic, incorporating special vocal processing and elements of glitch music.

It was originally released on KK Records in Belgium in 1998 (cat. no. KK 141); it was licensed to various companies. The album was released in the U.S. by Shadow Records in 2000 and peaked at #32 on the CMJ RPM Charts.

<doc id="762418" wikidata="Q248308" url="?curid=762418" title="Al-Nabigha">
<text>Al-Nābighah (), al-Nābighah al-Dhubiyānī, or Nābighah al-Dhubyānī; real name Ziyad ibn Muawiyah (); was one of the last pre-Islamic Arabian poets. &quot;Al-Nabigha&quot; means genius or intelligent in Arabic.

== Biography ==
His tribe, the Banu Dhubyan, belonged to the district near Mecca, but he spent most of his time at the Lakhmid court of al-Hirah and the court of the Ghassanids. In al-Hirah, he remained under al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith, and then his successor in 562.

After a sojourn at the court of Ghassan, he returned to al-Hirah under al-Nu&#x27;man III ibn al-Mundhir. Owing to his verses written about the Queen he was compelled to flee to Ghassan, but returned ca., 600. When Numan died five years later he withdrew to his own tribe.

His date of death is uncertain, but seems to predate Islam. His poems consist largely of eulogies and satires, and are concerned with the strife of Hirah and Ghassan, and of the Banu Abs and the Banu Dhubyan. He is one of the six eminent pre-Islamic poets whose poems were collected before the middle of the 2nd century of Islam, and have been regarded as the standard of Arabic poetry; some writers consider him the first of the six.

== Religious beliefs ==
The religious beliefs of Al-Nabighah are unclear, but he appears to be represented as some sort of monotheist. Al-Nabighah regularly praises, in religious terms, the Christian Ghassanids, for example: &quot;God has arranged for him [the king] the best creation; He [God] is his [king’s] helper over/against the humankind&quot;. The following Arabic phrase occurs concerning the Ghassanids: &quot;majallatuhum dhātu l-ilāhi&quot;. Though the meaning is disputed, Nicolai Sinai and Ilkka Lindstedt both have interpreted it in relation to the Ghassanids possessing some sort of scripture or book bestowed upon them by God (which may or may not refer to the New Testament).

== Editions of poetry ==
His poems were edited by Wilhelm Ahlwardt in the &quot;Diwans of the Six Ancient Arabic Poets&quot; (London, 1870), and separately by Hartwig Derenbourg (Paris, 1869, a reprint from the &quot;Journal asiatique&quot; for 1868).

<text>Angela Margaret Mason (born 9 August 1944) is a British civil servant and activist, and a former director of the UK-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender lobbying organisation Stonewall. She is a former Chair of the Fawcett Society, a UK women&#x27;s rights campaigning organisation and a Labour Party councillor in Camden.

==Early life==

Born Angela Margaret Weir in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, she grew up on the Isle of Sheppey and was educated at Basingstoke High School, Bedford College, University of London, and the London School of Economics. She was an early member of the Gay Liberation Front in the UK.

==Terrorism charges==
She was one of the Stoke Newington Eight, who in 1972 were charged with planting or sending bombs which aimed to maim or kill government Ministers, their families and Conservative Party officials. She was one of the four accused who was acquitted following a long and still controversial trial. Mason still refuses to discuss the trial in interviews 

Mason was an activist in the trade union and radical movements.

==Career after Angry Brigade==
Mason became a lecturer at the LSE then the Principal Solicitor for the London Borough of Camden. She became a member of gay rights organisation Stonewall in 1989, becoming its director in 1992.

==In government==
From 2003 to 2007, she was the director of the UK government&#x27;s Women and Equality Unit, now the Government Equalities Office, with her high salary attracting media attention. Mason has also been a member of the Equal Opportunities Commission and an advisor to the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. Controversially she used her position as a senior civil servant to oppose one measure of legislative equality for gay people – protections against discrimination in the delivery of public and commercial services – in 2005 and 2006. She was, however, unsuccessful and the measure was passed in the Equality Act 2006. She was awarded the OBE in 1999 and promoted to CBE in 2007.

Since 2007, she has been an advisor to IDeA, a government quango which provides guidelines and regulations for all local authorities in England on equality issues. She was also appointed as chair of the feminist group the Fawcett Society in the same year.

In 2010, she was elected as a Labour councillor to Camden London Borough Council; she represented the borough&#x27;s Cantelowes ward. She served as Deputy Leader of the borough council, and cabinet member for sustainability but was dismissed from the roles in May 2011. She was, however, reappointed to the council&#x27;s Cabinet the following year, and was Cabinet Member for Children until her retirement from the council in 2022.

==Personal life==
Mason married scriptwriter William Mason in 1971, they divorced in 1980 with Mason retaining her married surname. She is in a Civil Partnership with Marxist academic Elizabeth Wilson and has a daughter who was conceived by artificial insemination.

<doc id="762432" wikidata="Q4886528" url="?curid=762432" title="Ben Summerskill">
<text>Ben Jeffrey Peter Summerskill (born 6 October 1961) is chair of The Silver Line and director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, a consortium of 135 charities working across the GB criminal justice pathway. He was the chief executive of the UK-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality organisation Stonewall, the largest gay equality body in Europe, from 2003 to 2014. He has also worked as a businessman and journalist. Summerskill is an occasional contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot; and other publications. In 2015 he won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the British LGBT Awards In 2017, he was appointed by the UK government to the council (Board) of ACAS, the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service. He was first appointed a trustee of the Silver Line in 2017.

==Early life and education==
Ben Summerskill&#x27;s paternal grandmother (Baroness) Edith Summerskill and his aunt (Dr) Shirley Summerskill were both Labour Members of Parliament and government ministers. Dr Edith Summerskill, a former Chairman of the Labour Party, was an early advocate of Britain&#x27;s free National Health Service and a vocal campaigner for women&#x27;s equality. Shirley Summerskill helped introduce the UK&#x27;s Sex Discrimination Act, as a Home Office minister. His maternal grandfather Sydney Elliott was a newspaper editor of various papers, including the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. In 1944, Elliott became Editorial Advisor at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, where he masterminded its campaign to support the Labour Party at the 1945 general election.

Ben Summerskill has a twin sister, Clare, who is a performer. He was educated at Cobden Road Infants School, Amherst County Primary School, Sevenoaks School, where he held a scholarship, and Merton College, Oxford, where he was an Exhibitioner (holder of a junior scholarship) but which he left after two years without taking a degree. He later wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I still recall being struck dumb on being shown, as an undergraduate, a note from an Oxford tutor to a successful candidate&#x27;s father: &#x27;Many thanks for lunch, and the trip in the Rolls.&#x27;&quot;

==Professional life==
His first career was in the restaurant trade. He was operations director from 1987 to 1990 with Kennedy Brookes, by then a publicly quoted hospitality company, responsible for 300 staff and an £18m turnover at the age of 26. Becoming a journalist in 1990, he rose to the position of assistant editor of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper which he joined in 2000 after having worked with Peter Hitchens and Peter Oborne as media editor for &quot;Daily Express&quot; editor Rosie Boycott, and the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; under editor and mentor Max Hastings and other magazines.

==Stonewall==
As chief executive of Stonewall, he succeeded Director Angela Mason in early 2003, expanding its work from parliamentary lobbying into other fields including workplace equality and campaigning against homophobia in schools. He led successful campaigns for the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, the introduction of Civil Partnership for lesbian and gay people in the UK and the introduction in 2007 of protections against discrimination in the provision of &quot;goods and services&quot;, covering areas from healthcare and housing to hotels and holidays. He also led a successful parliamentary campaign in 2007–08 for introduction of a criminal offence of incitement to homophobic hatred and a campaign in 2009–10 to enable gay people to celebrate civil partnerships in religious premises. He also restored Stonewall to financial good health after a number of very precarious years. (Its turnover was £1.4m in 2003, during which it ran a deficit of £117,000, and £5.3m by 2014, with reserves having risen from £11,000 in 2003 to £3.2m and staff numbers rising from 21 to 75.)

Under his direction, Stonewall&#x27;s Diversity Champions programme, promoting good practice among major UK employers, grew from 35 to more than 600 members, employing 5.5 million people between them, ranging from IBM and Tesco to all of Britain&#x27;s armed services and MI5. Stonewall&#x27;s Education for All programme, launched in 2005 to help tackle homophobic bullying in Britain&#x27;s schools and universities, was supported by 70 major teaching and children&#x27;s organisations.

In 2006, Summerskill was appointed a Commissioner on the Britain&#x27;s new Equality and Human Rights Commission. He had for three years been a member of a Steering Group advising the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on establishing the commission, which has statutory powers for the first time to promote equality for lesbian and gay people. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. He was appointed to the committee of the Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service in 2009. In July 2009 Summerskill resigned as an EHRC commissioner citing differences over leadership with its chair Trevor Phillips. Five other commissioners resigned at the same time.

In 2010 he was a finalist as Ernst &amp; Young Social Entrepreneur of the Year and in 2011 he was shortlisted as Britain&#x27;s Most Admired Charity Chief Executive in the Third Sector Awards.

In November 2011 Anthony Ryan, 42, received an eight-month prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court after threatening to &quot;put a bullet in the head&quot; of Summerskill. Ryan, whose sentence was suspended for 18 months, suggested that Summerskill start making &quot;funeral arrangements&quot;.

In 2013 he was named by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; as one of London&#x27;s 1000 most influential people. Summerskill stood down as chief executive of Stonewall in January 2014. His resignation was marked by a &quot;Guardian&quot; editorial.

During his time at Stonewall, Summerskill attracted controversy over the organisation&#x27;s decision not to campaign on transgender issues. The 2008 Stonewall Awards faced protests from transgender rights activists, but Summerskill maintained that the organisation should exclusively campaign for &quot;gay men, lesbians and bisexuals&quot;. The policy of excluding transgender issues was reviewed within months of his 2014 departure and eventually reversed.

==Politics==
Summerskill was a Labour councillor for the Westbourne ward of Westminster City Council from 1994 to 1998.

During his time at Stonewall, Summerskill frequently attracted controversy over the organisation&#x27;s decision not to support equal marriage. In a departure from many others in the LGBT rights movement, Summerskill also voiced his opposition to same-sex marriage while serving as Stonewall&#x27;s chief executive. Speaking at the 2010 Liberal Democrat conference, Summerskill suggested &quot;lots&quot; of gay people didn&#x27;t want same-sex marriage to be legal. The event was attended by Lynne Featherstone, the minister for equality; Evan Harris, president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group DELGA; and Liberal Democrat MP Steve Gilbert, all of whom questioned Summerskill&#x27;s comments. A poll commissioned by LGBT outlet &quot;PinkNews&quot; found 98% in support of marriage equality.

Following a backlash that saw a number of calls for Summerskill&#x27;s resignation, Stonewall confirmed it would support equal marriage in October 2010.

Speaking to &quot;The Observer&quot; in March 2014, he controversially criticised the Liberal Democrats as having only supported equal marriage in order to draw &quot;clear blue water&quot; between their coalition partners, the Conservatives, despite Stonewall having not been in favour of equal marriage when the issue was introduced into the Coalition-led Parliament. Peter Tatchell was particularly critical: &quot;Stonewall does great work but the gay campaign for marriage equality faced an uphill struggle, which was made worse by Stonewall constantly undermining our efforts. Some of the arguments Ben and Stonewall put forward at the time [2010] were quoted by homophobes to justify their opposition to same-sex marriage and this was hugely damaging. I am not a supporter of the Liberal Democrats, but on the issue of same-sex marriage the party took an early position, while Stonewall did all it could to sabotage that position.&quot;

<doc id="762445" wikidata="Q7866970" url="?curid=762445" title="USS Abele">
<text>USS &quot;Abele&quot; (AN-58) was a in the service of the United States Navy, named after Populus alba, commonly called abele, silver poplar, or white poplar.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 8 January 1943 at New Bern, North Carolina, by the Barbour Boat Works; launched on 19 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. G. B. Waters; and commissioned at Morehead, North Carolina, on 2 June 1944.

==War service==
Following brief shakedown training out of Norfolk, Virginia and Boston, Massachusetts, the net laying ship sailed on 11 August for the Pacific Ocean. She made stops at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the Panama Canal Zone, Manzanillo, Mexico; and San Diego. On 27 September, she reached Pearl Harbor and reported to Commander, Minecraft, Pacific Fleet, who assigned her to target towing and net defense duty.

On 24 January 1945, &quot;Abele&quot; left Pearl Harbor, bound for Iwo Jima. After sailing via Eniwetok and Guam with Task Group 51.5, the ship arrived off Iwo Jima on 20 February and began laying a torpedo net. She remained in the area for eight days laying nets and fleet moorings before getting underway on the 28th and heading for Saipan to prepare for the upcoming Okinawa invasion.

After a brief period spent in the Leyte Gulf staging area, &quot;Abele&quot; arrived off Kerama Retto on 26 March to begin laying net defenses. Although she was attacked by Japanese suicide boats and aircraft during the next seven weeks, she suffered no damage. On 18 April, the ship assisted in the downing of one enemy aircraft. On 12 May, she sailed to Nakagusuku Wan, Okinawa, and assisted in laying of heavy anti-torpedo nets across the harbor entrance. She also claimed credit for downing one Japanese &quot;Val&quot; on 11 June.

&quot;Abele&quot; was ordered to Tinian on 5 August to recover the anti-torpedo net located there. Following the formal Japanese surrender early in September, the ship got underway to return to the west coast of the United States. She reached San Francisco in late November. &quot;Abele&quot; was decommissioned on 1 March 1946, her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946, and the vessel was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 7 May 1947.

&quot;Abele&quot; won one battle star for her World War II service.

==Civilian service==
Delivered to Great Lakes Lumber and Shipping Company, Fort William, Ontario, 29 April 1947, as &quot;Abele&quot;. At some point she was converted to a tug. Sold to Straits Towing Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1953 and changing her name to &quot;Superior Straits&quot; in 1954. She was withdrawn from service with her engines removed in the 1960s, reducing her to a barge. In 1971 she was bought by P &amp; B Towing Ltd., North Vancouver, British Columbia. Dubarry Investments Ltd., Vancouver, acquired her in 1973 until 2006.

<text>Constance Caroline Woodhill Naden (24 January 185823 December 1889) was an English writer, poet and philosopher. She studied, wrote and lectured on philosophy and science, alongside publishing two volumes of poetry. Several collected works were published following her death at the young age of 31. In her honour, Robert Lewins established the Constance Naden Medal and had a bust of her installed at Mason Science College (now the University of Birmingham). William Ewart Gladstone considered her one of the nineteenth century&#x27;s foremost female poets.

==Early life==
Constance Naden was born on 24 January 1858 at 15 Francis Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, England to Caroline Ann Woodhill Naden who died within two weeks of giving birth, and Thomas Naden, an architect, later president of the Birmingham Architectural Association. She was brought up by her mother&#x27;s parents, Caroline and Josiah Woodhill, from 12 days old until her grandparents&#x27; deaths. Naden&#x27;s well-read and devout baptist grandparents lived at Pakenham House, Edgbaston. Her father lived with the Woodhills for a time, but by 1871 the census shows that he was living nearby with a new wife and Naden&#x27;s four half-siblings aged between three and seven. At age eight Naden was sent to a local Unitarian day school, where she developed a talent for painting. She submitted some paintings to the Birmingham Society of Artists, one of which (titled &#x27;Bird&#x27;s Nest and Wild Roses&#x27;) was accepted for display at the Society&#x27;s Spring Exhibition in 1878.

==Education==

She became interested in philosophy, languages and the sciences. In 1879, Naden attended the Birmingham and Midland Institute to study botany and French, and from 1881 to 1887 attended Mason Science College to study physics, geology, chemistry, physiology, and zoology; she also became a member of the Birmingham Natural History Society. Naden also edited the Mason College magazine. In 1885 she won the &quot;Paxton prize&quot; for an essay upon the geology of the district. In 1887 she won the &quot;Heslop&quot; gold medal for her long essay, &quot;Induction and Deduction&quot;, published after her death.

==Philosophy==

From the late 1870s onwards Naden developed a philosophy called Hylo-Idealism in collaboration with Robert Lewins, MD, whom she first met in 1876 and corresponded with for the rest of her life. The key principle of this philosophy is that &quot;Man is the maker of his own Cosmos, and that all his perceptions – even those which seem to represent solid, extended and external objects – have a merely subjective existence, bounded by the limits moulded by the character and conditions of his sentient being.&quot;

Naden published a number of essays defending this view, in the &quot;Journal of Science,&quot; &quot;Knowledge,&quot; &quot;The Agnostic Annual&quot; and other periodicals. She used such signatures as &quot;C.N.&quot;, &quot;C.A.&quot; and &quot;Constance Arden&quot;.

Naden was interested in Herbert Spencer&#x27;s concept of a unifying philosophy explaining the universe through the principles of evolution. In his work &quot;The Social Organism&quot; (1860), Spencer compared society to a living organism and argued that, just as biological organisms evolve through natural selection, society evolves and increases in complexity. 

==Poetic writing==
In 1881, Naden published her first volume of poetry &quot;Songs and Sonnets of Springtime&quot;. This is a diverse collection, and her sonnet sequence that describes the changing of the seasons is particularly notable.

==Later life== 

Naden&#x27;s grandmother Woodhill died on 21 June 1887 and she inherited a considerable fortune, which allowed her to travel to Constantinople (Istanbul), Palestine, India, and Egypt with her friend the educationalist and campaigner for women&#x27;s right to higher education, Madeline Daniell. 

She returned to England in June 1888 and bought a house on Park Street, Grosvenor Square, which she shared with Daniell. She raised funding to allow Indian women to study medicine and became a member of the National Indian Association. She joined the Aristotelian Society, endeavoured to form a Spencer society, and belonged to various societies of benevolent aims. On 22 October 1889 she delivered an address upon Mr. Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Sociology&quot; to the sociological section at Mason College. She also spoke about the need for women&#x27;s suffrage at public events, as recorded by reports in the Women&#x27;s Penny Paper.

Naden was described as:
slight and tall, with a delicate face and &#x27;clear blue-grey eyes.&#x27; She was regular and active in her habits. She had a penetrating voice, and was thoroughly self-possessed in public speaking.
While some noted her tendency towards sarcasm in formal debates and academic discussions, she was well-loved and had very warm personal and intellectual friendships. This is attested to by the poignant remembrances of her friends in the posthumous &quot;Memoir&quot;, for example Prof. Charles Lapworth wrote that he saw her &quot;not so much a student, [but] as an interested and sympathetic fellow-worker, and in her early death I have lost one of the best and dearest of my personal friends&quot;.

==Illness and death==

In 1889 a diagnosis of infected ovarian cysts was deemed to require surgery; on 5 December she was operated on by Lawson Tait, and while initially this was a success, on 23 December she died of a related infection. Naden&#x27;s last letter to Robert Lewins, which is printed on the opening pages of the 1891 essay collection &quot;Further Reliques of Constance Naden&quot; details the circumstances of the surgery and her worries regarding it. She was buried in the nonconformist Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham. The gravestone was badly damaged over the course of the twentieth century, and in September 2017 a campaign was launched to replace it with a more fitting memorial. A rededication ceremony for the new gravestone took place on Saturday 11 May 2019.

==Remembrance==
Naden was lauded after her death for her philosophical writings, by Robert Lewins, M.D., her contributions to poetry, her support of the women&#x27;s suffrage cause in popular women&#x27;s periodicals, and for her &quot;Pantheistic view of immortality&quot; by William Ewart Gladstone, in which he ranked her among the nineteenth century&#x27;s top female poets. Herbert Spencer, who had been an important influence on her work, remarked: &quot;I can think of no woman, save &#x27;George Eliot,&#x27; in whom there has been this union of high philosophical capacity with extensive acquisition. Unquestionably her subtle intelligence would have done much in furtherance of rational thought; and her death has entailed a serious loss.&quot; Lewins founded the Constance Naden Medal at Mason College in her honour, which is awarded each year, first for the &quot;best competitive philosophical essay&quot; and now for the best Faculty of Arts master&#x27;s degree thesis at the University of Birmingham. Lewins also commissioned a bust of Naden which he presented to Mason&#x27;s College. It sits on a plinth of three books, the spine of which are inscribed &quot;Songs and Sonnets of Springtime&quot; and &quot;A Modern Apostle, The Elixir of Life, etc.&quot; on the front and &quot;Induction and Deduction and Hylo-Idealism&quot; on the back. It was originally placed in the college&#x27;s library. Mason College became the University of Birmingham in 1900, and the bust stands in the Cadbury Research Library Reading Room.

On 14 December 2009, the Birmingham Civic Society provided a commemorative blue plaque which was unveiled by the Lord Mayor. It is located at her childhood home, Pakenham House 20 Charlotte Road, Edgbaston. The inscription reads &quot;Constance C.W. Naden 1858–1889 Poet, Scientist and Philosopher lived here for most of her life.&quot;

Naden&#x27;s grave in Key Hill Cemetery is shared with her mother and maternal grandparents. During the twentieth century the stone was broken up and buried, along with other memorials in the area; in 2010 it was excavated by the Friends of the Cemetery but it remained illegible. On 11 May 2019, following a successful fundraising campaign by the Constance Naden Trust, a rededication ceremony was held to mark the installation of Constance Naden&#x27;s new gravestone. The replacement stone reproduces the text on the original but draws additional attention to Naden&#x27;s achievements with the words &#x27;Poet, philosopher, artist, Scientist&#x27; newly inscribed near the top of the stone along with a line from her 1881 poem &#x27;The Pantheist&#x27;s Song of Immortality&#x27;: &#x27;For earth is not as though thou ne&#x27;er hadst been&#x27;.

==Posthumous publications==
Three books were published posthumously, &quot;Induction and deduction, and other essays&quot; (1890), &quot;Further Reliques of Constance Naden&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Complete Poetical Works of Constance Naden&quot; (1894). 

==Critical reception==
Naden&#x27;s poetry has received increasing attention since the 1980s, as people sought to recover lost women&#x27;s voices. A range of scholarship on her life and works has appeared, with particular focus on the interplay between literature and science in her works, her relationship with freethought, and her proto-feminist ideas. Clare Stainthorp has published an overview of the first three decades of critical writings on Naden, in which she also suggests avenues for future research. In 2019, Stainthorp&#x27;s book &quot;Constance Naden: Scientist, Philosopher, Poet&quot; provided the first in depth consideration of Naden&#x27;s life and explored the significance of her published and unpublished poems and essays.

<text>The 1962 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active since 1946, with only seven named storms. The season officially began on June 15, while the first tropical storm developed on June 30. No further activity occurred until late August, when Hurricane Alma brushed the Outer Banks before becoming extratropical southeast of New England, destroying hundreds of boats and producing beneficial rainfall. Around that time, Tropical Storm Becky developed unusually far east in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the easternmost storm on record to recurve to the northeast. Celia followed in the September, forming east of the Lesser Antilles and executing a loop near Bermuda before dissipating. Hurricane Daisy was the costliest of the season, leaving about $1.1 million in damage in New England (1962 USD). The storm dropped the highest rainfall total on record in Maine, and its precipitation caused 22 traffic fatalities. Ella, the strongest storm of the season, remained offshore of the eastern United States but caused two deaths. The final system, an unnamed hurricane, formed on November 28 and meandered erratically off the Southeastern United States before becoming extratropical on December 4.

In addition to the seven named storms, there were two non-developing tropical depressions. The first struck Texas in August, causing street flooding and killing three. The second formed off the west coast of Florida and flooded widespread areas after 1 in 100 year rainfall. The floods affected 5,000 houses and caused millions in damage. The season officially ended on November 15.

== Season activity ==
The hurricane season officially began on June 15, 1962. The National Hurricane Center began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the existing equipment. The agency had access to a system of radars that extended from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes. The season officially ended on November 15.

During the season, four hurricanes developed from seven named storms. This was below the average of 10 storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1946. Four of the five storms developed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, as well as a persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September 10 was the quietest in 30 years.

The only region of the United States threatened by hurricanes was New England, although no stations recorded hurricane-force winds in the country. This was the first such occurrence during the 20th century that no tropical storms or hurricanes hit the country. Overall damage was the lowest in several years.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm One ===

The first storm of the season originated from a cold front that stalled over the western Atlantic Ocean on June 28. A frontal low developed a day later off the coast of South Carolina. The low moved northward and northward, gradually acquiring tropical characteristics. The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee assessed that the system transitioned into a tropical storm by late on June 30, while moving over the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The storm at the time was co-located with an upper-level low, suggesting characteristics of a subtropical cyclone. Based on reports from ships and land stations, the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). On July 1, an approaching cold front steered the storm away from the coast. The storm gradually weakened and transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone late on July 2. Turning to the north, the storm moved across Newfoundland, and curved to the west and southwest, striking New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The storm turned back to the northeast, remaining offshore Nova Scotia until it was absorbed by an approaching extratropical storm on July 6.

While in its formative stages, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in coastal portions of North Carolina, causing locally heavy crop damage. Cedar Island reported of rainfall in an 18-hour period; at the time, it was the second-highest single-day rainfall total.
=== Hurricane Alma ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression along the southeast Florida coast on August 26. It moved northward along the coast, located beneath an anticyclone that aided in its intensification. The depression began a motion to the northeast on August 27, and that day it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alma about east of the Florida/Georgia border. This marked the latest development of the first storm since 1941. Alma steadily intensified as it paralleled the coastline of the Carolinas, becoming a hurricane on August 28 a few miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras. Despite its proximity, the storm produced peak wind gusts of only in Nags Head. Wind gusts downed a power pole in Hatteras, which caused an hour long power outage for one-third of the town. There, the storm tide was above normal, which resulted in some erosion. The highest rainfall total from Alma in the United States was a report of in Cape Hatteras. Damage in the state amounted to $35,000.

After passing the Outer Banks, Alma continued to intensify further, reaching peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) about 85 mi (140 km) south of Nantucket. Despite its intensity, the hurricane never developed a well-defined eye. Alma quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it made its closest approach to New England, due to cooler water temperatures. In Rhode Island and Massachusetts along the coast, the storm produced northerly winds of , and one house was damaged by a fallen tree. Tides reached above normal, which resulted in minor coastal flooding. However, Alma produced strong waves that destroyed over 100 boats. Damage from the storm was estimated at less than $1 million, though its rains were beneficial to drought-stricken areas of New England. Precipitation extended northward through Maine, and storm damage was reported as far north as Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Slick roads resulted in several traffic accidents, although there were no deaths. After moving by the region, Alma turned to the southeast due to a high-pressure system to its north. It became extratropical on August 30.
=== Tropical Storm Becky ===

A tropical disturbance emerged from Africa in late August and developed into a weak tropical depression on August 27. For about 30 hours, the system affected the Cape Verde islands with rainfall, during which it moved slowly to the west and west-northwest. Late on August 28, it was estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm. The next day, satellite imagery observed a well-developed tropical cyclone in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. In addition, a ship reported winds of force 9 on the Beaufort scale, suggesting winds of . On that basis, the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky, despite the agency only issuing advisories for storms west of 35° W. Around that time, the storm moved over an area of anomalously warm water temperatures, which allowed for its intensification. On August 30, Becky turned to the north and northeast due to an approaching trough, becoming the easternmost cyclone since 1886 that a storm began a motion to the north. A hurricane hunters flight on August 31 indicated that Becky became extratropical about south of Santa Maria Island in the Azores. The storm&#x27;s remnants continued to the northeast, dissipating on September 1 about west of Spain.
=== Tropical Storm Celia ===

A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 12, about east of the Lesser Antilles. However, satellite imagery indicated that it could have become a tropical cyclone a day earlier. Late on September 12, a ship reported winds of , which provided the basis for the San Juan Weather Bureau to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Celia. The storm quickly attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), and on September 13 a hurricane watch was issued for the northern Leeward Islands. However, Celia passed beneath a mid- to upper-level trough and quickly weakened. By late on September 14, a hurricane hunters flight indicated that the storm&#x27;s structure no longer resembled that of a tropical cyclone. The next day, Celia weakened to a tropical depression, and the Weather Bureau discontinued tropical cyclone advisories. It turned to the north and later to the east, passing well southeast of Bermuda. On September 18, Celia began executing a loop to the north, during which it re-intensified into a tropical storm, as reported by ships. It attained winds of on September 19, but again weakened to a tropical depression the next day. Celia became extratropical on September 21, without having affected land.
=== Hurricane Daisy ===
On September 29, reconnaissance aircraft indicated the formation of a tropical depression to the east of the Lesser Antilles. For several days it moved to the west-northwest, passing just north of the islands without intensifying further. This was due to its presence beneath an upper-level trough, although the system began intensifying as the trough dissipated. On October 2, after turning to the northwest between two high-pressure areas, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. Developing an anticyclone aloft, the storm continued to gradually intensify, reaching hurricane strength on October 3. Two days later, Daisy turned to the north-northeast and attained peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Cool air imparted weakening as Daisy turned northwestward, and on October 7, the storm transitioned into an extratropical about east of Chatham, Massachusetts. On the following day, the extratropical remnants of Daisy struck Nova Scotia just south of Yarmouth and later re-emerged into the Atlantic, before dissipating south of Newfoundland on October 9.

In New England, Hurricane Daisy&#x27;s outer rainbands combined with an approaching nor&#x27;easter to drop torrential rainfall over the region for 65 hours, producing upwards of in portions of Massachusetts. The highest total from Daisy alone was at Portland International Jetport in Maine; this was the state&#x27;s highest tropical cyclone rainfall total between 1950 and 2011. Across the region, the rains caused widespread flood damage. In Maine, wind gusts reaching destroyed hundreds of small boats, along with high waves from the storm. In New England, Daisy left five injuries, one direct death, and about $1.1 million in damage. Slick roads, however, resulted in 22 traffic fatalities. In Nova Scotia, winds gusted to , which destroyed three boats and left two towns without power service. Rough seas killed six people in the province.
=== Hurricane Ella ===

In the middle of October, an area of disturbed weather persisted across the Turks and Caicos Islands, associated with an upper-level low. On October 14, a tropical depression developed and moved northward. A day after forming, it intensified into Tropical Storm Ella as it began a track to the northwest, located east of a weakening upper-level trough. On October 17, Ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the east-northeast on October 19, and later that day Ella attained its peak intensity of ; that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to the northeast, and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of . Ella became extratropical on October 22 over the northern Atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front. Shortly thereafter its remnants moved over Newfoundland before dissipating on October 23.

Ella is historically notable for its role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The storm greatly complicated naval operations relating to the &#x27;quarantine&#x27; blockade of Cuba and badly damaged several Soviet nuclear-armed submarines en route to the island, contributing to the escalation of the B-59 Incident. Early in its duration, Hurricane Ella briefly threatened to strike the North Carolina coastline. Although it remained offshore, the hurricane produced significant beach erosion along the coast. There were two associated deaths from a missing motor boat that left Charleston, South Carolina. The crew of two was declared deceased after a Coast Guard, Navy, and Air Force search failed to locate their bodies. There was no damage in Canada from its remnants.
=== Hurricane Ten ===

On November 25, a cold front was stalled over the western Atlantic Ocean. A day later, an extratropical storm producing hurricane-force winds developed about south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The storm remained nearly stationary for several days near the coast, drifting westward and later to the south. On November 27, the storm&#x27;s wind structure became more symmetric, with an inner core developing inside the larger extratropical low. Based on ship reports near the center, the system transitioned into a hurricane early on November 28; due to its interaction with the extratropical storm, the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone, although the lack of satellite imagery prevented such a classification. By later on November 28, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, affected by wind shear. By that point, the storm had turned to the east, followed by a turn to the northwest and later west-southwest on the next day. Late on November 30, satellite imagery indicated an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. A day later, the storm re-intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h). On December 2, the hurricane turned back to the southwest as it made its closest approach to the Outer Banks. Stronger wind shear caused the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm again on December 3, as an approaching cold front steered the storm northeastward. Two days later, the storm transitioned back into an extratropical storm to the east of the Outer Banks, briefly regaining hurricane intensity on December 5. A day later, a larger extratropical storm over the northeastern United States absorbed the former hurricane.

For several days, the storm meandered off the southeast coast of the United States, producing high tides and beach erosion from Florida to Virginia; many of these areas were affected by a severe nor&#x27;easter in March 1962. The storm&#x27;s interaction with a ridge to its northeast produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in gale-force winds across the Virginia and North Carolina coast. In Virginia, a dredge involved in the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel broke loose and rain aground. During the storm&#x27;s formative stages, it produced wind gusts of on Oak Island, North Carolina. High waves washed away dunes, wrecked coastal houses, and sank several boats, including a ferry. The storm washed out a temporary bridge and deepened a temporary inlet on Hatteras Island north of Buxton, both the aftermath of the March 1962 storm. As a tropical cyclone, the hurricane produced tropical storm force winds along the North Carolina coast. Rainfall associated with the storm was generally light, except for portions of the Outer Banks and in Georgia.
=== Other systems ===

On August 26, a tropical depression formed in the western Gulf of Mexico about northeast of Tampico, Tamaulipas. It moved slowly to the north-northwest around a ridge without intensifying beyond winds of 30 mph (45 km/h). The system encountered wind shear throughout its duration, which displaced the convection from the center to its northeast. The depression struck just west of the Texas/Louisiana border on August 29 before dissipating on August 30. Rainfall in Texas was minimal, estimated around . However, heavy amounts of precipitation fell across Louisiana, peaking at near Hackberry. Rainfall extended northeastward through Arkansas and Missouri. On August 29 as the depression moved ashore, heavy rainfall caused street flooding in Cameron, Louisiana. Two tornadoes were reported in the town, one of which produced winds of . The storms damaged 115 houses or trailers, of which one was destroyed. There were 30 people injured, of whom 18 required hospital attention, and there were three deaths.

An upper-level low spawned a tropical depression off the west coast of Florida on September 20. The depression moved very slowly to the north-northwest, which produced heavy rainfall from Naples to Tampa, Florida. The highest total was in Sarasota, although precipitation of over extended into Georgia and extreme southern South Carolina. A developing cyclone off the Carolinas caused the dissipation of the depression on September 23. The rains resulted in of floodwaters across western Florida, and both the Manatee River and the Phillippi Creek experienced record crests. The flooding entered over 5,000 houses, which forced the evacuation of more than 100 families. The floods also caused schools to close in three counties. In addition, floodwaters affected thousands of acres of farmlands in six counties, and some did not dry out for several weeks. Wind gusts reached in eastern Florida, and more than 20,000 people were left without power. There was one death in the state related to the storm, and damage was estimated at $2.78 million.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1962. A storm was named &quot;Celia&quot; for the first time this season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1962 USD.

<text>Charles Nagel (August 9, 1849 – January 5, 1940) was a United States politician and lawyer from St. Louis, Missouri. He was Secretary of Commerce and Labor during President William Howard Taft&#x27;s administration (1909–1913) and was one of the key founders of the United States Chamber of Commerce.

==Life and career==
Nagel was born on August 9, 1849, in Colorado County, Texas, the son of Friedericke (Litzmann) and Hermann Nagel. Nagel moved to a boarding school in St. Louis, Missouri, for high school and stayed to study law at Washington University School of Law. He graduated with his law degree in 1872. Nagel furthered his education by traveling to Europe and learning political economy at the University of Berlin.

Returning to St. Louis in 1873, Nagel joined the state bar and began to practice law. He was a member of the firm Finkelnburg, Nagel and Kirby, and later of Nagel and Kirby. His first foray into politics came when he won election to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1881, where he served until 1883. He was president of the St. Louis city council from 1893 to 1897. He also taught at St. Louis Law School (1885–1909) and was a member of the Republican National Committee (1908–1912).

Nagel was a corporate attorney for Adolphus Busch when President William Howard Taft chose him, in 1909, as Secretary of Commerce and Labor, a position he held until the end of the Taft administration in 1913. He was the last person to serve in the post before it was separated to two cabinet positions, Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Labor. While heading the Department of Commerce and Labor, Nagel made it more accessible to the needs of businessmen while also expanding the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.

Nagel was also a founder of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Following his time in the cabinet, Nagel returned to the practice of law, arguing before the Supreme Court three times before his death. He died in St. Louis, Missouri on January 5, 1940, and was interred there in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

==Family==
Nagel was married twice: first, in 1876, to Fannie Brandeis, the sister of Louis Dembitz Brandeis, later a Supreme Court justice. She died in 1889 and he married Anne Shepley in 1895. He had six children, including Charles Nagel, Jr., an architect and curator.

<doc id="762487" wikidata="Q403629" url="?curid=762487" title="Mostafa el-Nahas">
<text>Mostafa el-Nahas Pasha or Mostafa Nahas (; June 15, 1879 – August 23, 1965) was an Egyptian politician who served as the Prime Minister for five terms.

==Early life, education and exile ==
He was born in Samanud (Gharbiyya) where his father was a lumber merchant. He graduated from el-Nassereyya Elementary School in Cairo in 1891. He also graduated from the Khedivial Secondary School in 1896. After earning his license from the Khedivial Law School in 1900, he worked in Mohammad Farid&#x27;s law office before opening his own practice in Mansoura. In 1904 he became a judge in the Tanta National Court. He was dismissed from the bench in 1919 when he joined the Wafd as a representative of the Egyptian National Party. Exiled with Saad Zaghlul to the Seychelles in 1921-1923, Nahhas was chosen upon his repatriation to represent Samanud in the first Chamber of Deputies elected under the 1923 Constitution.

==Political history==
He became minister for communications in 1924. Reelected in 1926 as a deputy from Sir Abu Nanna (Gharbiyya) and barred by the British from taking another cabinet post, he was elected one of the Chamber&#x27;s two vice presidents and, in 1927, its president. Upon Sa&#x27;d Zaghlul&#x27;s death in August 1927, he defeated Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s nephew in the contest to lead the Wafd Party.

He served as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1928, 1930, between 1936 and 1937, from 1942 until 1944, and finally between 1950 and 1952. He was prime minister for only a few months in 1928 after clashing with the king over his desire to strictly limit royal power. Nahhas married a much younger wife from a very prominent family, Zainab Hanem Elwakil, who was more than 30 years younger than he was. His wife was said to have great influence on him, and is alleged to have played a big role in spoiling the friendship between Mostafa el-Nahhas and Makram Ebeid. When the Great Palestinian Revolt started in 1936, Nahas helped to found the Arab Higher Committee to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people. In the Abdeen Palace incident of 1942, the British ambassador Sir Miles Lampson presented King Farouk with an abdication decree drafted by Sir Walter Monckton after the palace was surrounded by troops. Farouk capitulated, and Nahas formed a new government shortly thereafter as prime minister.

Nahas fell out with his patron, Makram Ebeid who was serving as the Finance minister and expelled him from the Wafd and the cabinet at the instigation of his wife. Ebeid retaliated with &quot;The Black Book&quot;, a detailed expose published in the spring of 1943 listing 108 cases of major corruption involving Nahas and his wife. Ebeid accused Nahas of having the Egyptian embassy in London buy expensive silver-fox fur coats for his wife with government funds; of confiscating a school in the Garden City area of Cairo to turn into his personal office; of using government money to irrigate land in the desert owned by his cousin; and of abusing his position as prime minister to pressure landowners in the Nile delta to sell farmland to him. Against Madame Nahas, Ebeid accused her of engaging in insider trading on the Alexandria cotton exchange and of pressuring her husband to appoint members of her family to high offices of state that they were not qualified for. Even Lampson wrote in his diary that &quot;the so-called book does seem to contain pretty damaging evidence&quot;. His wife died two years after his death in 1967. His and her cemetery are located in the Elwakil yard in Basateen, Cairo.He also helped found the Arab League in 1944.  

In 1950, in a volte-face that stunned observers of Egyptian politics, Karim Thabet of King Farouk&#x27;s &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; arranged an alliance between the king and Nahas Pasha. The U.S ambassador Jefferson Caffery reported to Washington:&quot;The proposal was that the King would receive Nahas in private audience prior to summoning a Wafd government and that if the King were not satisfied by his conversation with Nahas, Nahas gave his word or honor that he would retire from the leadership of the Wafd Party as an &quot;elder statesmen&quot; and that the King would then be free to choose any of the younger Wafd leaders in whom he had confidence. The King agreed to this proposal and was completely captivated by Nahas, who tactfully started the interview by swearing that his one desire in life was to kiss the King&#x27;s hand and to remain always worthy in His Majesty&#x27;s opinion of being allowed to repeat the performance. At this point Nahas went on his knees before the King who according to Thabet was so charmed that he assisted him to his feet with the words, &quot;Rise, Mr. Prime Minister&quot;&quot;. Caffery reported in his cable to Washington that he was appalled that Nahas, whom Caffery called the most stupid and corrupt politician in Egypt, was now prime minister. Caffery stated that Nahas was unqualified to be prime minister because of his &quot;completely total ignorance of the facts of life as they apply to the situation today&quot;, giving the example: &quot;Most observers are willing to concede that Nahas knows of the existence of Korea, but I have found no one who would be willing to seriously contend that he is aware of the fact that Korea borders on Red China. His ignorance is as colossal as it is appalling...At the time of my interview with Nahas he was totally unconscious of the subject which I was discussing. The only ray of light which penetrated was the fact that I wanted something from him. This prompted the street politician&#x27;s response of &quot;aidez-nous et nous vous aiderons&quot;. Caffery stated that Nahas&#x27;s French (the language of the Egyptian elite) was &quot;of dubious quality&quot; and he spoke a colloquial Egyptian Arabic more appropriate to the streets than the high society of Cairo. Caffery called Nahas a venal &quot;street politician&quot; whose only platform was the &quot;tried and true formula of &#x27;Evacuation and Unity of the Nile Valley&#x27;&quot; and stated the only positive aspect of him as prime minister was that &quot;we can get anything which we want from him if we are willing to pay for it&quot;.

Nahas&#x27;s government was extremely corrupt and in year 1951 alone Madame Nahas had acquired ownership of one thousand acres of farmland in the Nile Delta, which was ideal for growing cotton and made her into an extremely rich woman. The Korean War caused a shortfall in the American cotton production as young men were called up for national service, causing a cotton boom in Egypt. As the international prices for cotton rose, Egyptian landlords forced their tenant farmers to grow more cotton at the expense of food, leading to major food shortages and inflation in Egypt. Nahas passed a law forbidding Egyptian farmers to grow wheat, which would done something to reduce the food shortages and the consequent inflation, as he and his wife personally benefited from the high international prices for cotton.  

Nahas promised in early 1951 a Five Year Plan to provide a $20 million US dollars for a universal pension system plus money for improved education, clean drinking water, and better roads, but nothing came of the plan while the corruption continued unabated. He was one of the signers of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, but in 1951 he denounced it. In a bid for popularity amid rumors that King Farouk was planning to dismiss him, on 17 October 1951 Nahas unilaterally abrogated the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian treaty, making himself the hero of the hour. Nahas told Parliament: &quot;It was for Egypt that I signed the 1936 treaty and it is for Egypt that I call on you to abrogate it&quot;. 
As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base, announced a boycott of British goods, forbade Egyptian workers to enter the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks, turning the area around the Suez Canal into a low level war zone. On 24 January 1952, Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal, during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas. In response, General George Erskine on 25 January sent out British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia and gave the policemen an hour to surrender their arms under the grounds the police were arming the guerrillas. The police commander called the Interior Minister, Fouad Serageddin, Nahas&#x27;s right-hand man, who was smoking cigars in his bath at the time, to ask if he should surrender or fight. Serageddin ordered the police to fight &quot;to the last man and the last bullet&quot;. The resulting battle saw the police station leveled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed, together with 3 British soldiers. The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt and the next day, 26 January 1952 was &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, as the anti-British riot was known, that saw much of Downtown Cairo, which Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris, burned down. Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day.  

After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Wafd Party was dissolved. Both he and his wife were imprisoned from 1953 to 1954. He then retired to private life. His death on 23 August 1965 led to a mass demonstration at his funeral that was allowed by Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s government.

It appeared nearly 10,000 years ago and from that time has constantly increased in size. 75% of the contemporary area became waterlogged less than 500 years ago.

The swamp is a major reservoir of fresh water for the region, and the Vasyugan river has its source there. It is home to a number of endangered species which is a concern among local environmentalists as the production of oil and gas has become a major industry in the region.

The swamp has a continental climate (Walter system) or taiga (WWF system), with long cold winters and short hot summers.

<text>Syed Sajjad Ali Shah (; 17 February 1933 – 7 March 2017) was a Pakistani judge who served as the 13th Chief Justice of Pakistan from 4 June 1994 to 2 December 1997. He had been appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by Benazir Bhutto. Prior to that, he served as the 6th Chief Justice of Sindh High Court from 13 December 1989 to 4 November 1990.

== Early life and career ==
Shah was born on 17 February 1933 in Karachi. He enrolled as an advocate in 1959, and eventually became a district public prosecutor, an additional district and sessions judge, and, later, a district and sessions judge.

He was appointed as joint secretary in the federal Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs and, in 1977, was posted as the Registrar of the Supreme Court. In 1987, he was made a judge of the Sindh High Court 1987.

Shah served as the Chief Justice of Sindh High Court from 13 December 1989 to 4 November 1990.

== Chief Justice of Pakistan ==
When Dr. Nasim Hasan Shah retired as Chief Justice of Pakistan in 1994, Justice Saad Saud Jan should have taken his place based on seniority. But Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto threw tradition overboard when she bypassed two senior judges and appointed Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of Pakistan. Later, she was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari on charges of corruption, and Sajjad Ali Shah, along with six other judges of the Supreme Court, upheld this decision. Reading from a 12-page short order, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah said: &quot;The presidential order contained enough substance and adequate material had been provided to conclude that the government could not be run in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and that an appeal to the electorate had become necessary.&quot; He became a critic of Nawaz Sharif and matters came to a head in 1997 when Sharif was defending himself in Supreme Court against accusations of corruption. An unruly mob stormed into the Supreme Court, forcing CJ Sajjad Ali Shah to adjourn the case against PM Nawaz Sharif. Hundreds of Sharif supporters broke through the police cordon around the courthouse and the Chief Justice had to flee for his safety. The police managed to restore order only after baton charging and tear gassing the mob, both inside and outside the courthouse.

President Leghari had given his support to Sharif. He was appalled by the measures being taken by the government but had no powers to dismiss it since the Eighth Amendment had been revoked. He was particularly concerned when he was asked by the government to dismiss Syed Sajjad Ali Shah and appoint an acting Chief Justice of Pakistan. He, therefore, resigned on 2 December 1997. Shortly afterwards, Muhammad Rafiq Tarar was elected to replace him as the President. On 23 December, Ajmal Mian was appointed as permanent Chief Justice. Sajjad Ali Shah had been dismissed.

==Death==
Syed Sajjad Ali Shah died at the age of 84 on 7 March 2017 in Karachi after suffering from severe chest infection.

<text>Rudolf John Frederick Lehmann (2 June 1907 – 7 April 1987) was an English publisher, poet and man of letters. He founded the periodicals &quot;New Writing&quot; and &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, and the publishing house of John Lehmann Limited.

==Early life and education==
Born in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, the fourth child of journalist Rudolph Lehmann, and brother of Helen Lehmann, novelist Rosamond Lehmann and actress Beatrix Lehmann, he was educated at Eton and read English at Trinity College, Cambridge. He considered his time at both as &quot;lost years&quot;. At Trinity, Lehmann had a passionate relationship with Virginia Woolf&#x27;s nephew, Quentin Bell.

==Literary magazine founder==

After a period as a journalist in Vienna, he returned to England to found the popular periodical &quot;New Writing&quot; (1936–40) in book format. This literary magazine sought to break down social barriers and published works by working-class authors as well as educated middle-class writers and poets. It proved a great influence on literature of the period and an outlet for writers such as Christopher Isherwood, W. H. Auden, Edward Upward and miner-author B. L. Coombes. Lehmann included many of these authors in his anthology &quot;Poems for Spain&quot; which he edited with Stephen Spender. With the onset of the Second World War and paper rationing, &quot;New Writing&#x27;s&quot; future was uncertain and so Lehmann wrote &quot;New Writing in Europe&quot; for Pelican Books, one of the first critical summaries of the writers of the 1930s in which he championed the authors who had been the stars of &quot;New Writing&quot;—Auden and Spender—and also his close friend Tom Wintringham and Wintringham&#x27;s ally, the emerging George Orwell. Wintringham reintroduced Lehmann to Allen Lane of Penguin Books, who secured paper for &quot;The Penguin New Writing&quot; a monthly book-magazine, this time in paperback. The first issue featured Orwell&#x27;s essay &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot;. Occasional hardback editions combined with the magazine &quot;Daylight&quot; appeared sporadically, but it was as &quot;Penguin New Writing&quot; that the magazine survived until 1950.

==Publisher==
He joined Leonard and Virginia Woolf as managing director of Hogarth Press between 1938 and 1946. He then established his own publishing company, John Lehmann Limited, with his novelist sister Rosamond Lehmann (who had a nine-year affair with one of Lehmann&#x27;s contributing poets, Cecil Day-Lewis). They published new works by authors such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Nikos Kazantzakis, and discovered talents like Thom Gunn and Laurie Lee. Lehmann edited two anthologies of new writing entitled &quot;Orpheus: A Symposium of the Arts&quot; (1948–49). He also published the first two books by the cookery writer Elizabeth David, &quot;A Book of Mediterranean Food&quot; and &quot;French Country Cooking&quot;. He published two of Denton Welch&#x27;s posthumous works: &quot;A Voice Through a Cloud&quot; (for which he supplied the title) (1950) and &quot;A Last Sheaf&quot; (1951). This publishing house published several book series, including the Chiltern Library, the Holiday Library, the Modern European Library, and the Library of Art and Travel. It operated from 1946–1953.

==Autobiographer==
In 1954, he founded &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, remaining as editor until 1961, following which he was a frequent lecturer and completed his three-volume autobiography, &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot; (1955), &quot;I Am My Brother&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Ample Proposition&quot; (1966). &quot;In The Purely Pagan Sense&quot; (1976) is an autobiographical record of his homosexual life in England and pre-war Germany, discreetly written in the form of a novel. He also wrote the biographies &quot;Edith Sitwell&quot; (1952), &quot;Virginia Woolf and her World&quot; (1975), &quot;Thrown to the Woolfs&quot; (1978), &quot;Rupert Brooke&quot; (1980) and &quot;Christopher Isherwood. A Personal Memoir&quot; (1987). His book &quot;Three Literary Friendships&quot; (1983), deals with the relationships between Lord Byron and Percy Shelley, Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, Robert Frost and Edward Thomas.

In 1965, he published &quot;Christ the Hunter&quot;, a spiritual/autobiographical prose poem which had been broadcast in 1964 on the BBC Third Programme. In 1974, Lehmann published a book of poems, &quot;The Reader at Night,&quot; hand-printed on handmade paper and hand-bound in an edition of 250 signed copies (Toronto, Basilike, 1974). An essay by Paul Davies about the creation of this book is included in Professor A.T. Tolley&#x27;s collection, &quot;John Lehmann: A Tribute&quot; (Ottawa; Carleton University Press, 1987), which also includes pieces by Roy Fuller, Thom Gunn, Charles Osborne, Christopher Levenson, Jeremy Reed, George Woodcock, and others.

==Death==
Lehmann died in London in April 1987.

<text>Israel ben Moses Najara (; ; – ) was a prolific Jewish liturgical poet, preacher, Biblical commentator, kabbalist (although this is disputed), and rabbi in Gaza.

== Biography ==
The rabbinic Najara family was originally from Nájera, a Spanish city in Northern Spain on the Najerilla river. Nájera was the former capital of the Kingdom of Navarre and in the 11th century it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile. In the rabbinical literature of the 16th-19th centuries, Najaras are found in Algiers, Tunis, Damascus, and Gaza.

It is believed that Najara&#x27;s grandfather, rabbi Levi Najara, was born in Spain and fled to Damascus due to the 1492 expulsion of the Jews from Spain. His father, rabbi Moshe ben Levi Najara, was born in Salonica, Greece, and in his later years moved with his family to Safed and was involved with the kabbalistic circles of the Arizal. Rabbi Israel Najara was born in Damascus around 1555. He lived most of his life between Safed, Damascus, and Gaza. Many details of his life can be inferred from his poetry. After an attack on the Jews of Safed by an Arabic tribe in 1579, Najara left with his family and settled in Jobar on the outskirts of Damascus, where he served as a sofer and rabbi. He experienced unusual personal tragedy; his first wife died at a young age, and his only daughter from this marriage died at the age of ten. He eventually remarried, and some of the children from his second marriage survived into adulthood. In his later years, he was a rabbi in Gaza, where he is buried. One of his sons, Moses Najara, was also a poet, and succeeded his father as the chief rabbi of Gaza. His grandson Yaakov Najara was embroiled in the Sabbatean controversy.

From his secular poems, which he wrote in the meters of various Ladino, Turkish, and Greek songs, it is evident that he was familiar with several foreign languages. He traveled extensively in the Ottoman Empire; there is evidence that he visited Salonica, Istanbul and Bursa. Due to his upbringing in Safed, he came under the extensive influence of Lurianic Kabbalah.

As may be seen from his works, he was a versatile scholar, and he corresponded with many contemporary rabbis, among others with Bezaleel Ashkenazi, Yom-Ṭob Ẓahalon, Moses Hamon, and Menahem Ḥefeẓ. His poetic effusions were exceptionally numerous, and many of them were translated into Persian. While still young he composed many hymns, to Arabic and Turkish tunes, with the intention, as he says in the preface to his &quot;Zemirot Yisrael,&quot; of turning the Jewish youth from profane songs. He wrote &quot;piyyuṭim&quot;, &quot;pizmonim&quot;, &quot;seliḥot&quot;, &quot;vidduyim&quot;, and dirges for all the week-days and for Sabbaths, holy days, and occasional ceremonies, these piyyuṭim being collected in his &quot;Zemirot Yisrael.&quot; Many of the &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; are in Aramaic.

== Works ==
Najara&#x27;s letters, secular poems, epigrams, and rhymed prose form the work entitled &quot;Meimei Yisrael&quot; () are published at the end of the second edition of the &quot;Zemirot Yisrael&quot; (). Najara&#x27;s other works are as follows: 
*&quot;Mesaḥeḳet ha-Tebel&quot; (Safed, 1587), an ethical poem on the nothingness of the world;
*&quot;Shoḥaṭe ha-Yeladim&quot; (printed with Moses Ventura&#x27;s &quot;Yemin Mosheh&quot;, Amsterdam, 1718), Hebrew verse on the laws of slaughtering and porging, composed at the request of his son Moses;
*&quot;Ketubbat Yisrael&quot; (with Joseph Jaabez&#x27;s &quot;Ma&#x27;amar ha-Aḥdut&quot;, n.p., 1794), a hymn which, in the kabalistic fashion, represents the relationship between God and Israel as one between man and wife (it was composed for the holiday of Shavuot);
*A collection of hymns published by M. H. Friedländer (Vienna, 1858) under the title &quot;Pizmonim&quot;.

His unpublished works are:
*&quot;She&#x27;erit Yisrael&quot;, containing sixty poems, which is, according to its heading, the second part of &quot;Zemirot Yisrael&quot;; it is found in the &quot;bet ha-midrash&quot; of the German community in Amsterdam; from it Leopold Dukes published one poem;
*&quot;Ma&#x27;arkhot Yisrael&quot;, a commentary on the Pentateuch;
*&quot;Miḳveh Yisrael&quot;, sermons
*&quot;Piẓ&#x27;ei Ohev&quot;, a commentary on Job.

M. Sachs attempted to render some of Najara&#x27;s &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; into German.

After the ruins of the house inhabited by R. Judah he-Ḥasid at Jerusalem were cleared away in 1836, some writings of Israel Najara of the year 1579 were found.

=== Zemirot Yisrael ===
&quot;Zemirot Yisrael&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Zemirot Yisrael Najara&quot;, was first published at Safed (1587) and contained 108 &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; and hymns. Many additional songs were printed in the Venetian edition from 1599. This edition contains the &quot;Meme Yisrael&quot; and the &quot;Mesaḥeḳet ha-Tebel&quot; additions, and is divided into three parts: 
# &quot;Olat Tamid&quot; (), containing 225 &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; organized according to the Ottoman makam system; he notes twelve makamlar: Rast, Dugah, Huseyni, Bûselik, Segâh, Segâh Irak, Acem, Mahur, Neva Uzzal, Naks Huseyni, and Nikriz;
# &quot;Olat Shabbat&quot; (), containing 54 &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; for each Shabbat of the year (set to presumably well known melodies of other piyyutim, as indicated in the incipits);
# &quot;Olat Ḥodesh&quot; (), containing 160 &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; and dirges for the High Holy Days, Purim, the Ninth of Ab, and occasional ceremonies. These include epic poems recounting the Hanukkah and Purim stories, as well as the &quot;piyyuṭ&quot; sung by Sephardic communities on Shavuot (also known as the &quot;ketubbah shel matan Torah&quot;) describing an allegorical &quot;marriage contract&quot; between God and Israel. It was published a third time at Belgrade (1837), but with the omission of many songs and of the two works just mentioned. Extracts from the &quot;Zemirot Yisrael&quot; were published under the title of &quot;Tefillot Nora&#x27;ot&quot; (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1712).

===Influence===
Many of Najara&#x27;s &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; and hymns have been taken into the rituals and &quot;maḥzorim&quot; in use among the Jews in different countries, especially in Italy and Israel.

The poetic works of Rabbi Israel Najara had considerable influence on the various &quot;baqashot&quot; traditions of Morocco, Turkey (also known as the &quot;maftirim&quot; tradition), and Syria. At least 26 compositions by Najara are part of the Moroccan &quot;baqashot&quot; canon, and roughly 8 of the 66 Syrian &quot;baqashot&quot; were composed by Najara (). On Shabbat eve, the Jews of Aleppo sing many hymns and prayers written by Najara.

The best known of his hymns are &quot;Yah Ribbon &#x27;Alam&quot; () recited on the Sabbath by the Jews of various countries, as well as &quot;Yodukha Ra&#x27;ayonay&quot; () and &quot;Yarhiq Nedod&quot; ().

== Critical reception ==
For some of his poetic innovations – for example his hymns on the marriage of God and Israel – Najara was severely criticized by Menahem Lonzano when the latter was in Damascus.

The &quot;Shibḥei Ḥayyim Viṭal&quot; contains a violent attack (accusations included: use of foul language, being a drunkard, homosexuality, and sexual relations with non-Jewish women) by Hayyim Vital upon a poet whose name is not mentioned, but whom some take to be Israel Najara. (It was later discovered that Vital actually had named Najara, but this had been censored out until the 1954 publication of &quot;Sefer HaḤezyonot&quot; based on Vital&#x27;s own autograph manuscript.) However, Vital did not make these accusations based on observation, but rather based on mystical revelations which he claimed to have received from a spirit. Despite the accusations, Isaac Luria, Vital&#x27;s teacher, declared that Najara&#x27;s hymns were listened to with delight in heaven. Najara&#x27;s &quot;piyyuṭim&quot; were praised also by Leon of Modena, who composed a song in his honor, which was printed at the beginning of the &quot;Olat Shabbat,&quot; the second part of the &quot;Zemirot Yisrael.&quot;

<text>was a Japanese doctor known chiefly for his tenure as Director-General of the World Health Organization.

==Early life and education==

He was born in Chiba, Japan, on 16 May 1928.

In 1955 Nakajima received his M.D. from Tokyo Medical University, Japan. He then studied in Paris.

At some point after 1967, he obtained a PhD in medical sciences in Japan.

==Professional life==

===Before 1974: France and Japan===

From 1956 or 1958 to 1967 Nakajima worked at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research doing medical and pharmaceutical research. After his stay in France, he returned to Japan and became research director of Nippon Roche, a Japanese subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche.

===Early work at WHO===

Nakajima joined WHO in 1974 in the position of Scientist, Drug Evaluation and Monitoring. In 1976, he became Chief of the WHO Drug Policies and Management Unit. It was in this position that he played a key role in developing the concept of essential drugs, as Secretary of the first Expert Committee on the subject.

In 1978 or 1979, the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific nominated and elected Nakajima as Regional Director, an office he held for two consecutive terms until 1988 when he was elected Director-General of WHO.

===1988–1993: First term as Director-General of WHO===

In January 1988 the WHO executive board selected Nakajima to become Director-General in a 17-to-14 vote over Carlyle Guerra de Macedo of Brazil.

During his leadership at WHO he notoriously had a conflict with then head of the WHO&#x27;s Global Programme on AIDS (GPA), Jonathan Mann, which resulted in Mann&#x27;s resignation. Mann thought Nakajima was not aggressive enough in his approach against AIDS. Much of the success of the Global Programme on AIDS was attributed to Mann, who also had autonomy over the Global Programme on AIDS, which Nakajima wanted to take away. Nakajima also limited Mann&#x27;s budget and travel. Following Mann&#x27;s resignation, the number of GPA staff dropped from more than 250 to four. This conflict and its impact on WHO&#x27;s AIDS efforts has been documented as a part of the PBS Frontline documentary &quot;The age of AIDS&quot;.

During his tenure, Nakajima was also accused of being a poor communicator and administrator.

During his first term in 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched.

===1993–1998: Second term as Director-General of WHO===

In May 1993, Nakajima was re-elected in a 93-to-58 vote to a second term of office as Director-General. His re-election was opposed by all major donor countries to the WHO including the United States. There was controversy surrounding this re-election because the WHO awarded contracts to executive board members prior to the vote by the executive board in January. An audit was conducted that concluded in March and cleared Nakajima of misusing WHO&#x27;s finances. Nakajima ran against Mohammed Abdelmoumène, an Algerian neurologist and Nakajima&#x27;s deputy who had been fired by Nakajima in August 1992 for &quot;disloyalty&quot;.

In 1997, Nakajima announced that he was not seeking another re-election and that his term of office would end in July 1998. He was replaced by Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, whose candidacy was supported by the United States and the European Union.

==Death==

Nakajima died after a short illness in Poitiers, France, on January 26, 2013.

<text>Rhythmeen is the twelfth studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top, released in 1996. It is their last album with longtime producer Bill Ham.

==Production and recording==
Billy recalls &quot;Rick Rubin has turned me on to one of his acts called Barkmarket and that the guitar player uses C# and B tunings so we began experimenting with really low tunings.&quot; Around the Rhythmeen era Billy&#x27;s collection of African artifacts began and several tracks include African tribal percussion.

This is when Billy began to sport the Nudu Hat, woven by the Bamileke tribe in Cameroon, Africa.

Gibbons uses a 1955 Les Paul Goldtop guitar which is featured prominently throughout the album.

&quot;We originally had a working title of &#x27;Nearing the Completion Stage&#x27;. But, it was the backbeat, that mean groove, which hit us as a strong recurring element of the album. So, we did our customary play on words, shuffling words about until we came up with our own invention—a feel-good elixir named Rhythmeen.&quot;

==Reception==

AllMusic gave it a mixed review, stating, &quot;ZZ Top&#x27;s long-awaited return to blues finally arrived in 1996, well over a decade after they abandoned their simple three-chord boogie for a synth and drum machine-driven three-chord boogie.&quot;

The album peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number 32 on the UK Albums Chart.

<text>Galata is the former name of the Karaköy neighbourhood in Istanbul, which is located at the northern shore of the Golden Horn. The district is connected to the historic Fatih district by several bridges that cross the Golden Horn, most notably the Galata Bridge. The medieval citadel of Galata was a colony of the Republic of Genoa between 1273 and 1453. The famous Galata Tower was built by the Genoese in 1348 at the northernmost and highest point of the citadel. Galata is now a quarter within the district of Beyoğlu in Istanbul.
== Etymology ==
There are several theories concerning the origin of the name &quot;Galata&quot;. The Greeks believe that the name comes either from &quot;Galatai&quot; (meaning &quot;Gauls&quot;), as the Celtic tribe of Gauls (Galatians) were thought to have camped here during the Hellenistic period before settling into Galatia in central Anatolia; or from &quot;galatas&quot; (meaning &quot;milkman&quot;), as the area was used by shepherds for grazing in the Early Medieval (Byzantine) period. According to another hypothesis it is a variant of the Italian word &quot;calata&quot;, which means &quot;a section of the docks of the ports intended for the mooring of merchant ships, for the direct embarkation or disembarkation of goods or passengers, for the temporary storage of goods and marine equipment&quot;, since the neighborhood was for centuries a Genoese colony. The name &quot;Galata&quot; has subsequently been given by the city of Genoa to its naval museum, &quot;Galata - Museo del mare&quot;, which was opened in 2004.

== History ==

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
In historic documents, Galata is often called Pera, which comes from the old Greek name for the place, Peran en Sykais, literally &quot;the Fig Field on the Other Side.&quot;

The quarter first appears in Late Antiquity as Sykai or Sycae. By the time the &quot;Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae&quot; was compiled in ca. 425 AD, it had become an integral part of the city as its 13th region. According to the &quot;Notitia&quot;, it featured public baths and a forum built by Emperor Honorius (r. 395–423), a theatre, a porticoed street and 435 mansions. It is also probable that the settlement was enclosed by walls in the 5th century. Sykai received full city rights under Justinian I (r. 527–565), who renamed it Iustinianopolis, but declined and was probably abandoned in the 7th century. Only the large tower, &quot;Megalos Pyrgos&quot; (the &quot;kastellion tou Galatou&quot;) which controlled the northern end of the sea chain that blocked the entrance to the Golden Horn remained. Galata Tower (&quot;Christea Turris&quot;) was built in 1348 at the northern apex of the Genoese citadel.

In the 11th century, the quarter housed the city&#x27;s Jewish community, which came to number some 2,500 people. In 1171, a new Genoese settlement in the area was attacked and nearly destroyed. Despite Genoese averments that Venice had nothing to do with the attack, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) used the attack on the settlement as a pretext to imprison all Venetian citizens and confiscate all Venetian property within the Byzantine Empire. The &quot;kastellion&quot; and the Jewish quarter were seized and destroyed in 1203 by the Catholic crusaders during the Fourth Crusade, shortly before the sack of Constantinople.

In 1233, during the subsequent Latin Empire (1204–1261), a small Catholic chapel dedicated to St. Paul was built in place of a 6th-century Byzantine church in Galata. This chapel was significantly enlarged in 1325 by the Dominican friars, who officially renamed it as the Church of San Domenico, but local residents continued to use the original denomination of San Paolo. In 1407, Pope Gregory XII, in order to ensure the maintenance of the church, conceded indulgences to the visitors of the Monastery of San Paolo in Galata. The building is known today as the &quot;Arap Camii&quot; (Arab Mosque) because a few years after its conversion into a mosque (between 1475 and 1478) under the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II with the name &quot;Galata Camii&quot; (Galata Mosque; or alternatively &quot;Cami-i Kebir&quot;, i.e. Great Mosque), it was given by Sultan Bayezid II to the Spanish Moors who fled the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 and came to Istanbul.

In 1261, the quarter was retaken by the Byzantines, but Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) granted it to the Genoese in 1267 in accordance with the Treaty of Nymphaeum. The precise limits of the Genoese colony were stipulated in 1303, and they were prohibited from fortifying it. The Genoese however disregarded this, and through subsequent expansions of the walls, enlarged the area of their settlement. These walls, including the mid-14th-century Galata Tower (originally &quot;Christea Turris&quot;, &quot;Tower of Christ&quot;, and completed in 1348) survived largely intact until the 19th century, when most were dismantled in order to allow further urban expansion towards the northern neighbourhoods of Beyoğlu, Beşiktaş, and beyond. At present, only a small portion of the Genoese walls are still standing, in the vicinity of the Galata Tower.

With its design modeled after the 13th century wing of the Palazzo San Giorgio in Genoa, the Genoese Palace was built by the Podestà of Galata, Montano De Marini. It was known as the &quot;Palazzo del Comune&quot; (Palace of the Municipality) in the Genoese period and was initially built in 1314, damaged by fire in 1315 and repaired in 1316.

The building&#x27;s appearance remained largely unchanged until 1880, when its front (southern) façade on Bankalar Caddesi (facing the Golden Horn), together with about two-thirds of the building, was demolished for constructing the street&#x27;s tramway line. The front façade was later reconstructed in the 1880s with a different style and became a 5-floor office building named &quot;Bereket Han&quot;, while its rear (northern) façade on Kart Çınar Sokak (and the remaining one-third of the palace building) has retained the materials and design of the original structure, but needs restoration. Bankalar Caddesi has rows of Ottoman-era bank buildings, including the headquarters of the Ottoman Central Bank, which is today the Ottoman Bank Museum. Several ornaments that were originally on the façade of the Genoese Palace were used to embellish these 19th-century bank buildings in the late Ottoman period.

===Ottoman period===
When Constantinople fell to Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453, the neighborhood was mostly inhabited by Genoese and Venetian Catholics, though there were also some Greek, Armenian and Jewish residents. The Christian residents of Galata maintained a formal neutrality during the Ottoman siege, neither siding with the Sultan, nor openly against him. One modern historian, Halil İnalcık, has estimated (based on a census from 1455) that around 8% of Galata&#x27;s population fled after the city fell. 

In the 1455 census it is recorded that Jews primarily resided in the Fabya quarter and Samona (which is in the vicinity of present-day Karaköy). Though the Greek-speaking Jews of Galata appear to have retained their homes after the conquest, there are no Jewish households recorded in Galata by 1472, a situation that remained unchanged until the mid-16th century.

Contemporary accounts differ about the course of events that took place in Galata during the Ottoman conquest in 1453. By some accounts, those who remained in Galata surrendered to the Ottoman fleet, prostrating themselves before the Sultan and presenting to him the keys of the citadel. This account is fairly consistent in records from Michael Ducas and Giovanni Lomellino; but according to Laonikos Chalkokondyles, the Genoese mayor made the decision to surrender before the fleet arrived in Galata and relinquished the keys to the Ottoman commander Zagan Pasha, not the Sultan. One eyewitness, Leonard of Chios, describes the flight of Christians from the city:&quot;Those of them who did not manage to board their ships before the Turkish vessels reached their side of the harbor were captured; mothers were taken and their children left, or the reverse, as the case might be; and many were overcome by the sea and drowned in it. Jewels were scattered about, and they preyed on one another without pity.&quot;

According to Ducas and Michael Critobulus, the population was not harmed by Zaganos Pasha&#x27;s forces, but Chalkokondyles does not mention this good conduct, and Leonard of Chios says the population acted against orders from Genoa when they agreed to accept servitude for their lives and property to be spared. Those who fled had their property confiscated; however, according to Ducas and Lomellino, their property was restored if they returned within three months.

Morisco who were expelled from Spain settled in Galata around 1609–1620, their descendants intermingled with the locals.

Galata and Pera in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were a part of the &quot;Municipality of the Sixth Circle&quot; (), established under the laws of 11 Jumada al-Thani (Djem. II) and 24 Shawwal (Chev.) 1274, in 1858; the organisation of the central city in the city walls, &quot;Stamboul&quot; (), was not affected by these laws. All of Constantinople was in the &quot;Prefecture of the City of Constantinople&quot; ().

The Camondo Steps, a famous pedestrian stairway designed with a unique mix of the Neo-Baroque and early Art Nouveau styles, and built in circa 1870–1880 by the renowned Ottoman-Venetian Jewish banker Abraham Salomon Camondo, is also located on Bankalar Caddesi. The seaside mansion of the Camondo family, popularly known as the Camondo Palace (&quot;Kamondo Sarayı&quot;), was built between 1865 and 1869 and designed by architect Sarkis Balyan. It is located on the northern shore of the Golden Horn, within the nearby Kasımpaşa quarter to the west of Galata. It later became the headquarters of the Ministry of the Navy (&quot;Bahriye Nezareti&quot;) during the late Ottoman period, and is currently used by the Turkish Navy as the headquarters of the Northern Sea Area Command (&quot;Kuzey Deniz Saha Komutanlığı&quot;). The Camondo family also built two historic apartment buildings in Galata, both of which are named &quot;Kamondo Apartmanı&quot;: the older one is located at Serdar-ı Ekrem Street near Galata Tower and was built between 1861 and 1868; while the newer one is located at the corner between Felek Street and Hacı Ali Street and was built in 1881.

Galatasaray S.K., one of the most famous football clubs of Turkey, gets its name from this quarter and was established in 1905 in the nearby Galatasaray Square in Pera (now Beyoğlu), where Galatasaray High School, formerly known as the &quot;Mekteb-i Sultani&quot;, also stands. &quot;Galatasaray&quot; literally means &quot;Galata Palace&quot;.

In the early 20th century, Galata housed embassies of European countries and sizeable Christian minority groups. At the time, signage in businesses was multilingual. Matthew Ghazarian described Galata in the early 20th century as &quot;a bastion of diversity&quot; which was &quot;the Brooklyn to the Old City’s Manhattan.&quot;

==Media==

In the Ottoman era many newspapers in non-Muslim minority and foreign languages were produced in Galata, with production in daylight hours and distribution at nighttime; Ottoman authorities did not allow production of the Galata-based newspapers at night.

<text>USS &quot;Abeona&quot; was a mercantile stern wheel steamer that traded on the Mississippi between 1831 and her destruction by fire in 1872, except for two years, between 1863 and 1865, when she served the United States Navy as a gunboat.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Abeona&quot; was built in 1831, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the US Navy purchased her on 21 December 1864, at Cincinnati, Ohio. The navy converted her to a &quot;tinclad&quot; gunboat at Mound City, Illinois, and commissioned her there on 10 April 1865, (one day after the surrender of General Robert E. Lee).

==Service history==
&quot;Abeona&quot; performed patrol and guard duty on the Mississippi River, and its tributaries — primarily in the Mississippi River Squadron&#x27;s 5th (the Mississippi, between Natchez and Vicksburg) and 10th (the Cumberland River and upper Ohio River) Districts. After all organized Confederate resistance ceased and the South had begun its painful and uncertain return to a peaceful way of life, &quot;Abeona&quot; was decommissioned at Mound City, 4 August 1865.

She was sold there on 11 August 1865, to J. A. Williamson, &quot;et al.&quot;, and was registered under the same name on 17 October 1865. The veteran stern wheeler operated on the Mississippi, and its branches, until she caught fire at Cincinnati, 7 March 1872, and was destroyed.

As of 2004, no other ships in the United States Navy have borne this name.

<text>Sir Lewis Bernstein Namier (; 27 June 1888 – 19 August 1960) was a British historian of Polish-Jewish background. His best-known works were &quot;The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III&quot; (1929), &quot;England in the Age of the American Revolution&quot; (1930) and the &quot;History of Parliament&quot; series (begun 1940) he edited later in his life with John Brooke.

== Life ==

Namier was born Ludwik Bernstein Niemirowski in Wola Okrzejska in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, now part of the Lublin Voivodeship of southeastern Poland, although his family moved to Austrian Poland in 1890. His family were secular-minded Polish-Jewish gentry. His father, with whom young Lewis often quarreled, idolized the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By contrast, Namier throughout his life detested it. Before coming to England he was educated at the University of Lwów in Austrian Galicia (now in Ukraine) and the University of Lausanne. At Lausanne, Namier heard Vilfredo Pareto lecture, and Pareto&#x27;s ideas about elites would have a great influence on his thinking.

Namier emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1907, studied first at the London School of Economics for a year and then at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1908, and became a British subject in 1913, whereupon he anglicised his name. 

During the First World War, he fought as a private with the 20th Royal Fusiliers in 1914–15 but was discharged owing to poor eyesight. He then held positions with the Propaganda Department (1915–17), the Department of Information (1917–18) and finally with the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office (1918–20).

===Professional career===
Following the defeat of Germany in World War One, Namier joined the British delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919. Based on his personal background, Namier maintained a firm personal interest in Russian affairs; however, he was also seen as one of the biggest enemies of the newly-independent Polish state in the British political environment. During the Polish–Soviet War his relationship with the Polish delegation was highly antagonistic and his attitude towards Poland and Polish territories openly hostile. Namier was later accused of changing the British proposal – the &quot;Curzon Line&quot; – for the eastern border of Poland by leaving the city of Lviv (in Polish, Lwów) and the Oil Basin on the eastern side when the British Foreign Office sent a cable to the Commissar for Foreign Affairs of Bolshevik Russia, . 

The Polish delegation had no knowledge of the existence of Line &quot;A&quot; whatsoever since the idea of handing Lwów over to the Bolsheviks was rejected by Prime Minister Władysław Grabski at the very beginning of talks. Lwów had never been under the rule of Moscow in its history. 

Professor Piotr Eberhardt from the Polish Academy of Sciences speculates that Lloyd George could have been aware of Namier&#x27;s modification; Bartłomiej Rusin refutes the claims that Namier was responsible and calls him &quot;merely a convenient supplier of anti‑Polish arguments&quot;. 

The earlier-approved compromised version of the Curzon Line which was approved at the Spa Conference in Belgium was renamed by Namier as Curzon Line &quot;B&quot;. Chicherin relayed this document to Lenin who rejected it nevertheless, assured of his victory over Poland followed by a planned annexation of its entire territory.

In one of his memoranda Namier falsified the results of a national census from Eastern Galicia originating from Austria-Hungary. He single-handedly reduced the number of ethnic Poles living in the region from 2 million down to 600–700 inhabitants. Professor Anna M. Cienciala believes that Namier was not the original initiator of this misrepresentation, but merely an unscrupulous supplier of handy arguments for the anti-Polish lobby among the Entente members.

After leaving government service, Namier taught at Balliol (1920–21) before going into business for himself. Later Namier, who was a long-time Zionist, worked as political secretary for the Jewish Agency in Palestine (1929–31). For a time he was a close friend and associate of Chaim Weizmann, but Weizmann later severed relations with Namier when the latter converted to Anglicanism to marry his second wife.

Namier served as professor at the University of Manchester from 1931 until his retirement in 1953, having been loudly cheered by his students at the conclusion of his last lecture there on European History. Namier remained active in various Zionist groups (in particular, lobbying the British government to allow the creation of what he called a Jewish Fighting Force in the Mandate of Palestine) and from 1933 was engaged in efforts on behalf of Jewish refugees from Germany.

He was married twice and knighted in 1952 at the onset of Cold War. Also in 1952, Namier was given the honour of delivering the Romanes Lecture, on which subject Namier chose &quot;Monarchy and the Party System&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1917, Namier married a Russian refugee, Clara Sophia Edeleff-Poniatowska, although they separated in 1921. He was by this time estranged from his father so that when his father died in 1922 the family estate was left to Namier&#x27;s sister. In 1940 when he feared a Nazi invasion of Britain he burned a large number of his papers and arranged to commit suicide. 

In 1945, his first wife died. In 1947, he married writer Julia de Beausobre (born Iulia Michaelovna Kazarina), who authored a biography of him after his death. To marry Julia, who was a convinced Christian, he converted to Anglicanism which led to an estrangement with Chaim Weizman. 

His sister, Teodora Niemirowska, was the mother of Anna Kurska.

== Political views ==

Namier is best known for his work on the Parliament of Great Britain, in particular English politics in the 1760s. His principal conclusion of that decade was that there was no risk of an authoritarian disposal of British parliamentarism. By way of its very detailed study of individuals, this course of study caused substantial revision to accounts based on a party system. Namier&#x27;s best-known works were &quot;The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III&quot;, &quot;England in the Age of the American Revolution&quot; and the &quot;History of Parliament&quot; series he edited later in his life with John Brooke.

Namier used prosopography or collective biography of every Member of Parliament (MP) and peer who sat in the British Parliament in the latter 18th century to reveal that local interests, not national ones, often determined how parliamentarians voted. Namier argued very strongly that far from being tightly organised groups, both the Tories and Whigs were collections of ever-shifting and fluid small groups whose stances altered on an issue-by-issue basis. Namier felt that prosopographical methods were the best for analysing small groups like the House of Commons, but he was opposed to the application of prosopography to larger groups. At the time of its publication in 1929, &quot;The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III&quot; caused a historiographical revolution in understanding the 18th century.

&quot;What Namier&#x27;s minutely detailed studies revealed was the fact that politics in 1760 consisted mainly in the jockeying for position and influence by individuals within the political elite&quot; rather than ideas such as liberty or democracy, or rivalry with foreign kings, or social effects of industrial and technological change. &quot;Spending many years himself, off and on, in psychoanalysis, [Namier] believed that the &quot;deep-seated drives and emotions&quot; of the individual were what explained politics&quot;, wrote Richard J. Evans on 29 November 2019, reviewing &quot;Conservative Revolutionary: the lives of Lewis Namier&quot; (Manchester University Press, 2019), a new biography by D. W. Hayton (a participant in the History of Parliament project).

===Controversies===
Namier used sources such as wills and tax records to reveal the interests of the MPs. In his time, his methods were new and quite controversial. His obsession with collecting facts such as club membership of various MPs and then attempting to correlate them with voting patterns led his critics to accuse him of &quot;taking ideas out of history&quot;. Namier has been described by the historian Lawrence Stone as a member of an &#x27;elitist school&#x27; with a &#x27;deeply pessimistic attitude toward human affairs&#x27;.

His biographer John Cannon concludes:
:Namier&#x27;s achievements were greatly praised during his lifetime and unduly disparaged subsequently. On his chosen ground, the accession of George III, he made important and probably irreversible corrections to the traditional whiggish account...Later on Namier was not so much repudiated as outflanked, by critics who pointed to the narrowness of his concerns, and his lack of interest in anything but political history. The technique of structural analysis, with which his name was inextricably linked as &#x27;Namierism&#x27;, offered, in his view, an escape from voluminous narrative...[but] its limitations are very evident. There are great swathes of history where, for lack of evidence, structural analysis can hardly be applied. Even where it can, there is no guarantee that it will, in itself, generate interesting and important questions.

===Diplomatic history controversies===
As a former patient of Sigmund Freud, Namier was a believer in psychohistory. He also wrote on modern European history, especially diplomatic history and his later books &quot;Europe in Decay&quot;, &quot;In the Nazi Era&quot; and &quot;Diplomatic Prelude&quot; unsparingly condemned the Third Reich and appeasement. In the 1930s, Namier had been active in the anti-appeasement movement and together with his protégé A. J. P. Taylor spoke out against the Munich Agreement at several rallies in 1938. In the early 1950s, Namier had a celebrated debate on the pages of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; with the former French foreign minister Georges Bonnet. 

At issue was the question whether Bonnet had, as Namier charged, snubbed an offer by the Polish foreign minister Colonel Józef Beck in May 1938 to have Poland come to the aid of Czechoslovakia in the event of a German attack. Bonnet denied that such an offer had been made, which led Namier to accuse Bonnet of seeking to falsify the record. 

Namier concluded the debate in 1953 with words &quot;The Polish offer, for what it was worth, was first torpedoed by Bonnet the statesmen, and next obliterated by Bonnet the historian&quot;.

Namier&#x27;s writings on German history have been criticised for being influenced by Germanophobia. His hatred of Germany was legendary; Namier himself wrote in 1942 as the war raged on: &quot;it did not require either 1914, or 1933, or 1939 to teach me the truth about the Germans. Long before the last war I considered them a deadly menace to Europe and the civilisation.&quot; 

Like the work of his friend Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, Namier&#x27;s diplomatic histories are generally poorly regarded by modern historians because he was content to condemn appeasement without seeking to explain the reasons for it; and eager to dismiss political principles as rhetorical posturing.

<doc id="762531" wikidata="Q81523" url="?curid=762531" title="Galata Bridge">
<text>The Galata Bridge (, ) is a bridge that spans the Golden Horn in Istanbul, Turkey. From the end of the 19th century in particular, the bridge has featured in Turkish literature, theater, poetry and novels. The current Galata Bridge is just the latest in a series of bridges linking Eminönü in the Fatih district and Karaköy in Beyoğlu since the early 19th century. The current bridge, the fifth on the same site, was built in 1994.

The bridge was named after Galata (the former name for Karaköy) on the northern shore of the Golden Horn.

==History==
The first recorded bridge over the Golden Horn was built during the reign of Justinian the Great in the 6th century, close to the area near the Theodosian Land Walls at the western end of the city.

In 1453, before the Fall of Constantinople, the Turks assembled a mobile bridge by placing their ships side-by-side across the water, so that their troops could move from one side of the Golden Horn to the other.
In 1502–1503, Sultan Bayezid II solicited plans for a bridge in the current location. Utilising three well-known geometrical principles, the pressed-bow, parabolic curve and keystone arch, artist Leonardo da Vinci designed an unprecedented single span long bridge across the Golden Horn, which, had it been constructed, would have become the longest bridge span in the world. However, the ambitious design was not approved by the Sultan.

Another Italian artist, Michelangelo, was also invited to contribute a design but rejected the proposal, and the idea of building a bridge across the Golden Horn was shelved until the 19th century.

In 2001 a small-scale version of Leonardo&#x27;s bridge design was constructed near Oslo, Norway by the contemporary artist Vebjørn Sand, the first civil engineering project based on a Leonardo sketch ever to be constructed.

=== &quot;Hayratiye&quot; bridge ===
In the early 19th century, Mahmud II (1808–1839) had a bridge built further up the Golden Horn, between Azapkapı and Unkapanı. This bridge, known as the Hayratiye (Benefaction in English), was opened on September 3, 1836. The project was carried out by Deputy Lord High Admiral Fevzi Ahmet Paşa using the workers and facilities of the naval arsenal at nearby Kasımpaşa. According to the History of Lutfi, this bridge was built on linked pontoons and was around long.

=== &quot;Cisr-i Cedid&quot; bridge ===
In 1845 the first Galata Bridge at the mouth of the waterway (i.e. on the current site) was constructed out of wood at the request of the Valide Sultan, the mother of Abd-ul-Mejid I (1839–1861). It was known as the Cisr-i Cedid (New Bridge) to distinguish it from the earlier bridge further up the Golden Horn, which became known as the Cisr-i Atik (Old Bridge). The Baedeker&#x27;s guidebook also referred to it as the Sultan Valideh Bridge. It continued in use for 18 years.

On the Karaköy side of the bridge, an inscribed couplet by poet İbrahim Şinasi recorded that the New Bridge was built by Sultan Abdulmejid I who was the first to pass over it. The first to pass below it was the French captain Magnan in his ship the &quot;Cygne&quot;.

For the first three days, crossing the bridge was free. After that, a toll (&quot;mürüriye&quot;) was paid to the Naval Ministry. Toll-collecting started on November 25, 1845 and the following tolls were collected:
*Free: military and law enforcement personnel, fire fighters on duty, clergy,
*5 para: pedestrians,
*10 para: people with backpacks,
*20 para: load-bearing animals,
*100 para: horse carriages,
*3 para: sheep, goats or other animals

Until 31 May 1930, this toll was collected by officials in white uniforms who stood at both ends of the bridge.

=== The second bridge ===
In 1863 this bridge was replaced by a second wooden bridge, built by Ethem Pertev Paşa on the orders of Sultan Abdulaziz (1861–1876) during the infrastructure improvements that preceded Napoleon III&#x27;s visit to Istanbul.

=== The third bridge ===

In 1870, a contract was signed with a French company, Forges et Chantiers de la Mediteranée for construction of a third bridge, but the outbreak of war between France and Germany delayed the project, which was given instead to the British firm G. Wells in 1872. This bridge, completed in 1875, was long and wide and rested on 24 pontoons. It was built at a cost of 105,000 gold liras and was used until 1912 when it was towed upstream to replace the old Cisr-i Atik Bridge.

=== The fourth bridge ===
The fourth Galata Bridge (in Turkish usually known as &quot;Eski Köprü&quot;; lit. &quot;the old bridge&quot;) was built in 1912 by the German firm Hüttenwerk Oberhausen AG for 350,000 gold lira. This floating bridge was long and wide. The bridge was made of 12 individual pieces; 2 terrestrial pieces 17 meters in length, 9 pieces around 40 meters in length, and a central piece 66.7 meters in length, which made the bridge moveable. It was a tolled bridge until 1930.

The fourth bridge contained bars and restaurants at its underside. It is usually described as an important place for the development of modern Turkish rock music, due to it housing the influential bar . Modern Turkish rock bands and singers such as Duman, MFÖ, Şebnem Ferah and Teoman have spent their formative years in Kemancı. 

In 1992 it was badly damaged in a fire and after one week towed up from its original location. At the time of the fire disaster, the fifth and the current bridge was already under construction near the fourth one and the fourth bridge was planned to be decommissioned in the near future. During the towing process one damaged section of the bridge collapsed. The bridge was classified as a cultural heritage of the second degree by the Turkish authorities.

3 pieces of the bridge went missing after the towing. After repairs the remaining parts of the old bridge were repurposed between Ayvansaray-Hasköy in 2002. From July to October 2012 the bridge was opened for motor vehicles to ease the traffic flow on the Haliç Bridge, which was under renovation. Due to the fact that the bridge was not allowing ferries to pass, disrupting the water circulation and preventing the ongoing cleaning efforts at the Golden Horn the bridge&#x27;s middle section was towed near the shoreline in 2012. After the second towing the former shops and restaurants were squatted by the homeless and the bridge was left in disrepair. In 2016 the majority of the bridge was transported to and Tuzla shipyards. The remaining 50 meter section on the Hasköy/Balat coast was left in disrepair.

=== The fifth (current) bridge ===
The fifth Galata bridge was built by the Turkish construction company STFA just a few meters away from the previous bridge, between Karaköy and Eminönü, and completed in December 1994. It was designed and supervised by GAMB (Göncer Ayalp Engineering Company). It is a bascule bridge, which is long with a main span of . The deck of the bridge is wide and has two vehicular lanes and one walkway in each direction. Tram tracks running down the middle of it allow the T1 tram to run from Bağcılar, in the western suburbs to Kabataş, a few blocks away from Dolmabahçe Palace.

In 2003 a string of restaurants were added to the underside of the bridge in imitation of the more ramshackle ones that had clung to the underside of the fourth bridge.

==Culture==
The Galata Bridge has long acted as a symbolic link between the old city of Istanbul, site of the imperial palace and principal religious and secular institutions of the Ottoman Empire, and the modern districts of Beyoğlu, where a large proportion of the inhabitants used to be non-Muslims and where foreign merchants and diplomats lived and worked. As Peyami Safa wrote in his novel, &quot;Fatih-Harbiye&quot;, a person who went from Fatih to Harbiye via the bridge passed into a different civilisation and culture.

The bridge crops up in most late 19th-century accounts of Constantinople, perhaps most vividly in Edmondo De Amicis&#x27;s &quot;Constantinople&quot; in which he describes the colourful array of characters from many races to be seen on it. The bridge also appears in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; although it did not exist in the 16th century as the book suggests. 

It is sometimes suggested that the card game bridge acquired its name because the British soldiers who invented it used to cross the Galata Bridge on their way to favourite coffeehouses.

== In popular culture ==
Geert Mak&#x27;s short book, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, published in 2008, is entirely devoted to the bridge and the many people who make a living in and around it. Apart from its place in fiction, the Galata Bridge&#x27;s romantic appearance has made it the subject of many paintings and engravings.

The opening chapter of British author Ben Elton&#x27;s time-travelling novel &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; takes place on the Galata Bridge.

Duman&#x27;s first album &quot;Eski Köprünün Altında&quot; () and the album&#x27;s first song &quot;Köprüaltı&quot; () mention the fourth bridge.

The &quot;Istanbul Tales&quot; film of 2005 features the bridge in the last 10 minutes. Also showing the sections.

<doc id="762535" wikidata="Q3752751" url="?curid=762535" title="Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet">
<text>Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet PC, FBA (10 December 1845 – 18 January 1937) was an English jurist best known for his &quot;History of English Law before the Time of Edward I&quot;, written with F.W. Maitland, and his lifelong correspondence with US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. He was a member of the Cambridge Apostles.

== Life ==
Pollock was the eldest son of William Frederick Pollock, Master of the Court of Exchequer, and Juliet Creed, daughter of the Rev, Harry Creed. He was the grandson of Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, the great-nephew of Field Marshal Sir George Pollock, 1st Baronet, and the first cousin of Ernest Pollock, 1st Viscount Hanworth, Master of the Rolls.

He was educated at Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected Fellow in 1868 (later Honorable Fellow in 1920). In 1871 he was admitted to the Bar. He wrote a series of textbooks that took a new approach to the teaching of English Law including &quot;The Principles of Contract at Law and in Equity&quot; (1876) and &quot;The Law of Torts&quot; (1887).

Rather than relying on specific applications of law, these works emphasised underlying principles. They acted as models for future textbooks and helped modernise English legal education. Pollock taught at the University of Oxford (1883–1903), as Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence. He was Professor of Common Law in the Inns of Court (1884–1890). He was Editor of the Law Reports from 1895 to 1935. He was the first editor of the &quot;Law Quarterly Review&quot; which was founded in 1885. He was also, in 1894, the Chairman of The Society of Authors He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1911. He was elected Treasurer of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1931.

==Family==
Pollock married on 13 August 1873 to Georgina Harriet Deffell (died on 30 March 1935), a daughter of John Deffell. They had two children:
* Alice Isabella Pollock, born on 15 June 1876, died on 28 June 1953. Married first at St Marylebone Parish Church in London on 19 November 1902 to Sydney Waterlow (1878–1944), a diplomat and grandson of Sir Sydney Waterlow, 1st Baronet. This marriage was annulled in 1912, and she remarried the same year Captain Orlando Cyprian Williams, MC, CB (d.1967).
* Frederick John Pollock (1878–1963), a noted historian, who succeeded to the baronetcy.

== Fencing ==
Together with his younger brother, Walter Herries Pollock, he participated in the first English revival of historical fencing, originated by Alfred Hutton and his colleagues Egerton Castle, Captain Carl Thimm, Colonel Cyril Matthey, Captain Percy Rolt, Captain Ernest George Stenson Cooke, Captain Frank Herbert Whittow.

He was cited in an 1897 slander case involving the London Fencing Club when Sir John Hutton was sued by a French naval officer, Rene Martin Fortris, who accused Hutton of falsely stating that Fortris had been making unwelcome advances towards his daughter for two years. According to Fortris, this led to Sir Frederick Pollock and John Norbury declining his application for membership of the London Fencing Club. The jury was unimpressed by Fortris&#x27;s case and found in favour of Sir John Hutton.

<text>Henri Namphy (; 2 October 1932 – 26 June 2018) was a Haitian general and political figure who served as President of Haiti&#x27;s interim ruling body, the National Council of Government, from 7 February 1986 to 7 February 1988. He served again as President of Haiti from 20 June 1988 after the June 1988 coup that he led, until his deposition on September 17, 1988 in the September coup.

Following the fall of the government headed by President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled the country with his family in 1986, Lieutenant General Namphy became president of the interim governing council, made up of six civilian and military members, which promised elections and democratic reforms. His regime was given the moniker &quot;duvalierism without Duvalier&quot;.

Namphy, who enjoyed a reputation for being honest and apolitical, had trouble in his early weeks in power; Haitians ceased their celebrations over the departure of Duvalier and started rioting and looting. In March 1986, as violence swept the capital, Port-au-Prince, the popular justice minister resigned from the ruling council and Namphy dismissed three other members who had close ties with the Duvalier regime. The new council had two other members apart from Namphy. The council had difficulty in exerting its authority because of frequent strikes and demonstrations.

An election held in October for a constituent assembly to prepare a draft constitution reflected a lack of public interest in determining the country&#x27;s political future. The first attempt at elections, in November 1987, ended when some three dozen voters were massacred. In January 1988 Leslie Manigat won an election that was widely considered fraudulent, and Namphy overthrew him on 20 June in the June 1988 Haitian coup d&#x27;état after Manigat had dismissed Namphy as army commander, after Namphy had made moves that Manigat did not approve of. Namphy remained in power until 17 September 1988, when he was deposed by a group of young officers organized by General Prosper Avril.

He died from lung cancer on 26 June 2018 in the Dominican Republic, after 30 years in exile. He told his family that he wanted to be buried in the Dominican Republic. In his testament, he bequeathed his personal library to the Fundación Global Democracia y Desarrollo foundation.

Namphy was tetralingual (he spoke Haitian Creole, French, Spanish and English). He had married twice and had two daughters, one based in Martinique and the other in the Dominican Republic.

<text>Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier and 1st Baron Ettrick, (15 September 1819 – 19 December 1898) was a British polyglot, diplomat and colonial administrator. He served as the British Minister to the United States from 1857 to 1859, Netherlands from 1859 to 1860, Russia from 1861 to 1864, Prussia from 1864 to 1866 and as the Governor of Madras from 1866 to 1872. He also acted as the Governor-General of India from February to May 1872.

Francis Napier was born on 15 September 1819 to William Napier, 9th Lord Napier and had his early education through private tutors. He joined the Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 but did not complete his graduation. Instead, he mastered foreign languages and served as a diplomat in foreign missions. In 1866, he was appointed Governor of Madras and served from 1866 to 1872. On the assassination of the Earl of Mayo, the then Viceroy of India in February 1872, Napier was appointed to act temporarily as the Viceroy of India and served from February to May 1872. Napier returned to the United Kingdom in July 1872 and in his later life, chaired the Napier Commission. Napier died at Florence, Italy on 18 December 1898 at the age of 79.

Napier was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1864. In 1872, he was created Baron Ettrick in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in recognition of his services in India.

== Early life and education ==
Francis Napier was born on 15 September 1819 to William John Napier, the 9th Lord Napier of Merchistoun and his wife, Elizabeth Cochrane-Johnstone at Thirlestane Castle in Selkirkshire. He was the eldest son of the couple.

Napier had his early education in private and was schooled at Saxe-Meiningen. He joined Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 but did not complete his graduation. However, he acquired a knowledge of a few foreign languages under the tutorship of one Rev. Walter Patterson. Napier became the 10th Lord Merchistoun on the death of his father William John Napier on 11 October 1834.

== Diplomatic career ==
Due to his fluency in multiple languages, Napier&#x27;s lack of educational qualifications was overlooked and he entered the diplomatic service in 1840. He was appointed to the British embassy at Vienna and later, Constantinople, where he served as an attaché. In 1848, Napier was appointed Secretary of the British delegation at Naples. He served as the Acting Ambassador for a period of eighteen months in Naples, when Italy was embroiled in the Sicilian insurrection.

After his experience in Naples, he found time to publish a book assessing contemporary painters in Naples. An aristocratic haughtiness regarding the local populace infuses his writing, dismissing the skills of more than one artist, and in reactionary fashion, the revolutionary instincts of the masses. In the preface, he writes: 
Napier&#x27;s handling of affairs as acting ambassador in Naples impressed the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Palmerston. He was posted to the British embassy at St Petersburg, where he became a close confidante of Tsar Alexander II. After serving short, satisfactory terms at the British embassies at St Petersburg and Constantinople, Napier was appointed envoy extraordinaire and minister plenipotentiary to the United States and served from 1857 to 1859. Napier&#x27;s tenure in Washington was soon mired in controversy. The abolitionist Charles Sumner and elements of the Northern press accused the British minister of being a pro-slavery partisan. More damaging still in the eyes of the British government was the claim that he had taken upon himself to declare in conversations that Britain recognized the Monroe Doctrine, when all the British governments till then had repudiated it. Critics at the Foreign Office accused him of &quot;giving up everything the United States can wish for, even before they ask it&quot;, which for them explained Napier&#x27;s immense popularity with Washington&#x27;s influential residents. He was recalled and given the less sensitive post of minister to the Netherlands. Napier served there from 1859 to 1861 and in Prussia from 1864 to 1866. He was then appointed Governor of Madras in 1866 and served from 27 March 1866 to 19 February 1872.

== Governor of Madras ==

As soon as Napier took office as the Governor of Madras, he was faced with a severe famine in Ganjam District. He took the services of Florence Nightingale whom he had known in Constantinople. Napier undertook many major irrigation schemes during his tenure. The Pennar Dam was completed during his tenure and two other irrigation works, the Rushikulya Dam in Ganjam and the Mullaperiyar Dam were conceived during his tenure.

Despite being at odds with different viceroys over financial issues throughout his tenure, Napier was able to resolve disputes in an amicable manner due to the friendly relations he had with Sir John Lawrence and well as his successor, Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo. When the Earl of Mayo was assassinated in the Andamans on 8 February 1872, Napier was designated to act as the Viceroy of India and he served for a short time before being relieved by Lord Northbrook. For his creditable performance as Governor of Madras, Napier was created Baron Ettrick of Ettrick in the peerage of the United Kingdom.
In 1869, Napier constructed the Napier Bridge across the Coovum River in Chennai. The Napier Park in Chennai and the Napier Museum in Trivandrum, Travancore were set up in his memory. Between 1866 and 1872, he had partially restored the Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal as well, which was earlier demolished considerably by Grandson of King Thirumalai Nayak.

In addition there is a surgical ward in Stanley Medical College Hospital in Chennai, named in his honor. The ward was originally built with the help of donations by the Governor Napier.

== Later life and death ==

At the end of his term as acting Viceroy of India, Napier returned to the United Kingdom and acted as the President of the Social Science Association during its meetings at Plymouth and Glasgow in October 1874. During this time, Napier also served in the London School Board.

Lord Napier continued, both in England and in Scotland, to take great interest in social questions. He was the chairman of the Napier Commission(the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands) which was appointed in 1883 and reported in 1884.

Napier died in Florence, Italy on 19 December 1898 at the age of 79.

== Honours ==
Napier was appointed to Privy Council in 1861 and made a Knight of the Thistle in 1864.

== Family==

Napier married Anne Jane Charlotte (1824–1911) on 2 September 1845. The couple had four sons.

* William Napier, 11th Lord Napier (1846–1913)
* John Scott (1848–1928)
* R. N. Basil (1850–1874)
* Mark Francis (1852–1919)

<doc id="762545" wikidata="Q1457961" url="?curid=762545" title="List of mine warfare vessels of the United States Navy">
<text>This is a list of mine warfare vessels of the United States Navy.

Ship status is indicated as either currently active [A] (including ready reserve), inactive [I], or precommissioning [P]. Ships in the inactive category include only ships in the inactive reserve, ships which have been disposed from US service have no listed status. Ships in the precommissioning category include ships under construction or on order.

==Historical overview==
Mine warfare consists of: minelaying, the deployment of explosive naval mines at sea to sink enemy ships or to prevent their access to particular areas; minesweeping, the removal or detonation of naval mines; and degaussing, the process of decreasing or eliminating a remnant magnetic field in a ship&#x27;s hull to prevent its detection by magnetic mines. The US Navy has operated ships and craft for all three purposes. Mine planting is the laying and maintenance of controlled mines for harbor defense, which was traditionally a role of the US Army.

===Classifications===
Mine warfare ships were originally considered by the US Navy to be either auxiliaries or yard and district craft, and so were given hull classification symbols beginning with either &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;Y&#x27;, depending on their capabilities. The exceptions were four converted cargo ships with ID numbers (prior to the modern hull system), certain large &#x27;cruiser&#x27; minelayers which were given hull symbols beginning with &#x27;CM&#x27;, converted destroyers which were given hull symbols beginning with &#x27;DM&#x27;, and three unclassified civilian cargo ships after World War II. 

On 7 February 1955 all of these ships and craft still in service or reserve were reclassed and received new hull symbols beginning with &#x27;M&#x27;, usually without change of hull number. The exception was the degaussing ships, which retained the &#x27;A&#x27; hull symbol.

Modern Littoral Combat Ships use &#x27;L&#x27; hull symbols even though they can be used for mine warfare.

==Auxiliary minelayers (ACM)==
All ACMs except USS &quot;Buttress&quot; and USS &quot;Monadnock&quot; were originally US Army mine planters.

Note that the official classification of these as &quot;devices&quot; rather than &quot;ships&quot; accounts for these ships absence of listings among the Navy&#x27;s ships while designated MSS-1 and MSS-2. 
* MSS-1, ex-Liberty ship &quot;Harry L. Glucksman&quot;
* , ex-LST-1166

==Submarine minelayers (SM)==

* USS &quot;Argonaut&quot; (SM-1), later APS-1, sunk by Japanese destroyers off Rabaul on 10 January 1943

== District auxiliary, miscellaneous (YAG) ==

Three Liberty ships were converted into experimental minesweepers.
* &quot;Floyd W. Spencer&quot; (YAG-36)
* &quot;John L. Sullivan&quot; (YAG-37)
* &quot;Edward Kavanagh&quot; (YAG-38)

Another Liberty ship, the SS &quot;R. Ney McNeely&quot;, was also converted into an experimental minesweeper, but was returned to the reserve fleet without having a YAG number assigned.

==Degaussing craft (YDG)==
*YDG-1
*YDG-2
*YDG-3
*YDG-4, lost off New Caledonia, 1 October 1943
*YDG-5
*YDG-6, ex-YMS-344
*YDG-7, ex-YMS-480
*YDG-8, ex-PCE-876, later ADG-8
*YDG-9, ex-PCE-879, later ADG-9
*YDG-10, ex-PCE-883, later ADG-10
*YDG-11, ex-PCE-919, AM-359, later ADG-11
==Motor mineplanters (YMP)==
Mineplanters were used to plant and maintain controlled mines for harbor defense; since the US Army had the primary responsibility for these minefields it is likely that the YMP hull designation was seldom used.

==Auxiliary motor mine sweepers (YMS)==
All Auxiliary Motor Mine Sweeper (YMS) ships to date are &quot;YMS-1&quot; class, which itself has multiple subclasses.

&quot;YMS-482&quot; through &quot;YMS-500&quot; were planned but cancelled.

==Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)==

The Littoral Combat Ships can carry Mine Warfare Modules which operate unmanned vehicles of various types for mine clearance operations.

==Unclassified civilian minesweepers==
After the end of World War II three war-damaged civilian ships with skeleton Navy crews and automated engineering spaces were used as minesweepers to trigger still-active US pressure mines in Japanese waters. There ships were not Navy ships and were to be disposed and therefore were not assigned Navy hull classifications. Reportedly no active mines were found.
* SS &quot;Pratt Victory&quot;
* SS &quot;Joseph Holt&quot;
* SS &quot;Marathon&quot;

<doc id="762556" wikidata="Q40524" url="?curid=762556" title="Pánfilo de Narváez">
<text>Pánfilo de Narváez (; born 1470 or 1478, died 1528) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; and soldier in the Americas. Born in Spain, he first sailed to the island of Jamaica (then Santiago) in 1510 as a soldier. Pánfilo participated in the conquest of Cuba and led an expedition to Camagüey, escorting Bartolomé de las Casas. 
He is best remembered as the leader of two failed expeditions, the first of which began in 1519 and ended in 1520 after defeat and capture in battle against Hernán Cortés. Pánfilo&#x27;s second expedition, the Narváez expedition, began in 1527 and ended for him with his death the following year. Only four men returned from it, reaching present-day Mexico City in 1536. He was named an &quot;adelantado&quot; by King Carlos V before embarking on that final expedition.

==Birth and family==
Pánfilo de Narváez was born in Castile (in either Navalmanzano, near Cuéllar, or Valladolid) in 1470 or 1478. He was a relative of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the first Spanish governor of Cuba. Pánfilo&#x27;s nephew was Antonio Velázquez de Narváez. Bartolomé de las Casas described him as &quot;a man of authoritative personality, tall of body and somewhat blonde inclined to redness&quot;.

==Early years as conquistador==
Narváez took part in the Spanish conquest of Jamaica in 1509. In 1511, he went to Cuba to participate in the conquest of that island under the command of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar. 

He led expeditions to the eastern end of the island in the company of Bartolomé de las Casas and Juan de Grijalva. De las Casas (who was an eyewitness) reported that Narváez presided over the massacre of Caonao, where Spanish troops killed a village full of natives who had come to meet them with food. After the massacre Narváez asked de las Casas, &quot;What do you think about what our Spaniards have done?&quot; De las Casas replied, &quot;I send both you and them to the Devil!&quot;

==Expedition to Mexico==
Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the governor of Cuba, sponsored Hernán Cortés to man an expedition to Mexico in 1519. With second thoughts about Cortés&#x27; loyalty, however, he recalled the expedition shortly after it began. Cortés disobeyed, proceeding with the expedition that would result in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Narváez (arriving from Cuba) was named governor of Mexico by Velázquez, who sent him and 1,400 men on 19 ships to México to intercept Cortés.

Narváez disembarked at Veracruz, where Cortés had left a small garrison and set out with the rest of his men for the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. The garrison was manned by Cortés&#x27; captain, Gonzalo de Sandoval, who captured some of Narváez&#x27;s men and sent them to Tenochtitlan to alert Cortés. Unable to defeat the garrison, Narváez went to the Totonac town of Cempoala and set up camp.

When news of Narváez&#x27;s arrival reached Cortés, he gathered a contingent of his troops (perhaps as few as 250) and returned to the coast. Although his remaining 900 men outnumbered those of Cortés three to one, Narváez was outmanoeuvred, lost an eye and was taken prisoner in the Battle of Cempoala on May 27, 1520. After a two-year imprisonment, he was returned to Spain.

==Expedition to Florida==

When Narváez returned to Spain, he was appointed &quot;adelantado&quot; of Florida by Charles V and sent to colonize the territory. He embarked from Sanlúcar de Barrameda on June 17, 1527, with a fleet of five ships and 600 men. Narváez himself believed that there were other wealthy empires, like the Aztecs, up North.

After reaching Cuba and losing several ships in a hurricane, Narváez regrouped and set sail with five ships, 400 men, and 10 women for the Rio de las Palmas (near present-day Tampico) in February 1528. His fleet ran aground, and he decided to go to Havana to obtain additional supplies. Narváez was unable to reach Havana, as storms and strong winds forced him north to Florida&#x27;s west coast. The expedition arrived there in April 1528, weakened by storms and desertions. Narváez landed with 300 men at the mouth of Boca Ciega Bay, north of Tampa Bay at the present-day Jungle Prada Site in St. Petersburg, among hostile natives.
He led an excursion inland, where he discovered the southern shore of present-day Old Tampa Bay. Narváez continued along its coastline and arrived at the main village of the Tocobaga Indians (present-day Safety Harbor), where he discovered &quot;many boxes from Castile&quot; and several European artefacts. Recent research suggests that he may have found the remnants of the 1521 settlement established and abandoned by Juan Ponce de León. 

Finding their landing place unsuitable for settlement, Narváez ordered the expedition to split into 100 men and 10 women aboard ships and 300 men and 42 horses travelling by land. They planned to head north along the coast, planning to re-unite at a large bay that his pilots assured him was nearby. There was no large harbour north of their landing site, and Narváez never saw his ships again.

His expedition moved north until it reached the present-day St. Marks River, in the territory of the Apalachee people. Unable to find the gold and other riches he sought and tired of hostilities with the natives, Narváez ordered the construction of four rafts in an attempt to reach Pánuco (his original destination). 

A storm drowned most of his remaining 240 men near Galveston Island, with only about 80 swept ashore. Narváez and a small group of men were carried out to sea and were never seen again. 

Only four men survived the six years it took for the remainder of the expedition to find its way back. It was eight years from their initial landing in Florida before they arrived in Culiacán (Sinaloa), where they found Melchor Diaz mayor and captain of the province. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado and the Moroccan slave Estevanico (Esteban) had remained in captivity on (or near) Galveston Island for six years.

Cabeza de Vaca wrote a &quot;relación&quot; about the journey on foot by these four survivors across the present-day southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It was the first book describing the people, animals, flora and fauna of inland North America.

<doc id="762557" wikidata="Q302157" url="?curid=762557" title="Aaron Jay Kernis">
<text>Aaron Jay Kernis (born January 15, 1960) is a Pulitzer Prize- and Grammy Award-winning American composer serving as a member of the Yale School of Music faculty. Kernis spent 15 years as the music advisor to the Minnesota Orchestra and as director of the Minnesota Orchestra&#x27;s Composers&#x27; Institute, and is currently the workshop director of the Nashville Symphony Composer Lab. He has received numerous awards and honors throughout his thirty-five-year career. He lives in New York City with his wife, pianist Evelyne Luest, and their two children.

== Background, early life, and education ==
Aaron Jay Kernis was born in Philadelphia, and grew up in neighboring Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania. He began his musical career by playing the violin and piano. His composition career began at age 13, and he was awarded three BMI Foundation Student Composers Awards throughout his time as a student. He studied composition with John Adams at the San Francisco Conservatory; Charles Wuorinen at the Manhattan School of Music; and Morton Subotnick, Bernard Rands, and Jacob Druckman at Yale University. His wide range of teachers and time spent on both the east and west coasts helps to define his eclectic musical style that blends minimalism with post-Romanticism.

== Works ==

=== Orchestral works ===
Aaron Kernis found immediate success as a composer when his work &quot;Dream of the Morning Sky&quot; was premiered in 1983 by the New York Philharmonic with Zubin Mehta conducting. He was only 23 years old at the time, but won unanimous praise for an incident that took place. In an open rehearsal, in front of an audience, Zubin Mehta stopped the orchestra to complain loudly about the vagueness of the score. Rather than being cowed by the strong-willed conductor, Aaron Jay Kernis simply replied, &quot;Just read what&#x27;s there.&quot; The audience applauded young Kernis for sticking up for his work, and within weeks the story received national attention.

Kernis has written more than 30 works for orchestra including concertos for cello, english horn, violin, viola, flute, horn, and toy piano. His key orchestral works include &quot;Musica Celestis&quot;, &quot;New Era Dance&quot;, &quot;Lament and Prayer&quot;, &quot;Newly Drawn Sky&quot;, and &quot;Colored Field&quot;.

=== Non-orchestral works ===
Although Kernis is known best for orchestral works, he has also written more than 30 works for chamber ensemble, 22 works for [chorus], and 14 solo [keyboard] compositions. &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Musica Instrumentalis&quot; stand out among his finest non-orchestral works. His music is published exclusively through G. Schirmer, New York. A complete works list is here.

== Musical style ==
Kernis&#x27;s style has been described as having neo-romantic intensity with exuberant imagination. His thematic material tends to keep audiences engaged while his sound palette offers them an innovative approach to orchestration. There have been many comparisons drawn to Leonard Bernstein, Gustav Mahler, and Igor Stravinsky due to their rhythmic drive and timbral exploration. His eclectic influences range from Claude Debussy to modern hip-hop music. Kernis claims that his works have been influenced by nineteenth century music, minimalism, and impressionism. He has said numerous times that he feels more comfortable writing beautiful music as opposed to atonal works. 

&quot;100 Greatest Dance Hits&quot; features a wide range of musical styles from rock to salsa. New York Philharmonic cellist Carter Brey says that Kernis is &quot;not afraid to take chances and that there is a lot of passion in his writing&quot;. Music critic Benjamin Ivry feels that Kernis&#x27;s success comes from a varied, ambitious style that is enjoyable to listen to. He characterizes him as an imaginative composer who is capable of achieving any emotion.

Kernis often starts his works with a visual image or concrete idea. &quot;Lament and Prayer for Orchestra&quot; (1996) was written to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Holocaust and &quot;Second Symphony&quot; (1991) was written in response to the Gulf War. His &quot;Concerto for Violin and Guitar&quot; (1997) has a jazz-like setting with Mahler-influenced lyricism. His Pulitzer-winning &quot;Musica Instrumentalis&quot; is based on the last movement of String Quartet No. 9 (Beethoven), which explains the sonata form and fugal writing of the work. Kernis often finds a way to blend his trademark creativity with the visual image or idea to create a piece that the audience can connect with emotionally. His goal for each of his compositions is to write music that moves the listener emotionally while maintaining innovation and his individual identity.

== Prizes, awards, and commissions ==
Aaron Jay Kernis has been honored by ASCAP, BMI, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the New York Foundation of Arts. In 1984, he won the Rome Prize that enabled him to study in Europe. Kernis received an exclusive five-year recording contract with Argo Records in 1996. In 1998, he won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Music, which recognized his &quot;String Quartet No. 2 (musica instrumentalis)&quot;. Then, in 2002, he won the prestigious University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for &quot;Colored Field&quot;. Kernis was also commissioned by Disney for his choral symphony &quot;Garden of Light&quot; for their millennium celebration. He also was awarded the 2012 Nemmers Prize in Music Composition, which allowed him to spend 2013–15 in residence at Northwestern University, and in 2014, he was named composer-in-residence for the 2014–2015 year at Mannes College.

Kernis has received commissions from leading ensembles and soloists around the world. His works have been premiered by the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Baltimore Symphony, San Francisco Symphony, Renée Fleming, and Joshua Bell, among others. He spent two years as composer-in-residence with Astral Artists in Philadelphia. Kernis also wrote &quot;Color Wheel&quot; in 2001 for the opening of the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s Kimmel Center.

In 2013, Kernis was inducted in to the American Classical Music Hall of Fame, and he was awarded the A. I. duPont Composers Award from the Delaware Symphony. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, he also was awarded the Stoeger Prize from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Joseph H. Bearns Prize, and a New York Foundation for the Arts Award.

In 2019 a Violin Concerto, composed by Kernis, won Grammy Awards for contemporary classical composition and classical instrumental solo.

== Discography ==
More than 45 of Kernis&#x27;s compositions have been recorded by major ensembles and soloists. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra received a Grammy nomination for its recording of various Kernis works. Joshua Bell also received a Grammy nomination for his recording of the work &quot;Air&quot; for violin. A full discography can be found here.

<text>Paul Horowitz (born 1942) is an American physicist and electrical engineer, known primarily for his work in electronics design, as well as for his role in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (see SETI).

==Biography==
At age 8, Horowitz achieved distinction as the world&#x27;s youngest amateur radio operator. He went on to study physics at Harvard University (A.B., 1965; A.M., 1967; Ph.D., 1970), where he has also spent all of his subsequent career. His early work was on scanning microscopy (using both protons and X-rays). Horowitz has also conducted astrophysical research on pulsars and investigations in biophysics. His interest in practical electronics has led to a handful of inventions, including an automated voting machine and an acoustic mechanism for landmine detection, and an electronic Morse Code/Baudot code keyboard using a diode matrix and 66 TTL integrated circuits for Amateur Radio use. Since 1974 he has taught a practical course in electronics whose lecture notes became one of the best known textbooks in the field: &quot;The Art of Electronics&quot; (coauthored with Winfield Hill).

Horowitz was one of the pioneers of the search of intelligent life beyond the Earth, and one of the leaders behind SETI. This work has attracted both admiration and criticism. Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr has sharply criticized Horowitz for wasting the resources of the university and the efforts of graduate students on such an endeavour. Carl Sagan provided a strong rebuttal to Mayr&#x27;s criticism, and pointed out that many eminent biologists and biochemists had endorsed SETI with the statement: 
 Sagan was believed to have based the main character in his novel &quot;Contact&quot; partly on Horowitz.

Horowitz led the META and BETA SETI projects. Horowitz and Sagan reported that, in the course of project META, they had detected 37 signals &quot;which survived all our cuts&quot; and cannot be positively identified.
On September 10, 1988 the university&#x27;s 84-foot radio dish detected &quot;an enormous spike which was 750 times noise. If you converted the radio signal into audio it would sound just like a tone. It would sound like a flute.&quot; All 37 signals, however, have been single events which have never been heard again. The software company 37signals has been named after these signals.

Horowitz holds professorial appointments at Harvard in both physics and electrical engineering. He has also served as a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group. One of his doctoral students, John A. Howell, is now Emeritus Professor of Physics at Earlham College.

<doc id="762575" wikidata="Q1311758" url="?curid=762575" title="William Natcher">
<text>William Huston Natcher (September 11, 1909 – March 29, 1994) was a Democratic congressman, serving in the United States House of Representatives from 1953 until his death from heart failure in Bethesda, Maryland in 1994. He is the second longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

==Early life==
Natcher was born on September 11, 1909, in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Natcher received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Western Kentucky State College (now Western Kentucky University) in Bowling Green in 1930 and an LL.B. from the Ohio State University in Columbus in 1933. Natcher married in 1937, and had two daughters.

Natcher practiced law in Bowling Green. From 1936 to 1937 he was U.S. Conciliation Commissioner for Kentucky&#x27;s Western District, and he served as Warren County Attorney from 1938 to 1950. Natcher was President of Kentucky&#x27;s Young Democratic Clubs from 1941 to 1946.

He served in the United States Navy during World War II. From 1951 to 1953 Natcher was Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Kentucky&#x27;s Eighth Judicial District.

==Congressional career==
He was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1953 from the 2nd district. He cast 18,401 consecutive roll-call votes between 1953 and 1994, never missing a single roll call vote over his forty-one-year Congressional career until his last days in office, the all-time record for both the House of Representatives and Congress as a whole. Natcher refused to accept campaign contributions. He was also chairman of the House Appropriations Committee from 1993 to 1994. His knowledge of House rules in debate led House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to employ him as presiding officer during crucial debates.

Natcher did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964.

Natcher holds the record for the longest perfect voting record in the history of Congress. He did not miss a single vote for nearly the entirety of his 40 years of service, casting 18,401 consecutive votes from his 1953 swearing to his last appearance on the House floor on March 3, 1994. On the day of his last vote, he arrived at the Capitol from Bethesda Naval Hospital by ambulance and was wheeled onto the House floor on a gurney. He missed the first vote of his career the next day, when doctors advised him not to return to the Capitol. He died a few weeks later, never having returned to the House floor again.

On March 4, 1994, Natcher was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President of the United States Bill Clinton. He continued to serve in Congress until his death on March 29, 1994, in Bethesda, Maryland.

===Legacy===
Natcher was a champion of road projects within Kentucky, especially the construction of a cable-stayed bridge between Kentucky and Indiana near Owensboro. Natcher helped get the majority of federal funding for the new bridge, which now carries U.S. Highway 231 across the Ohio River between Maceo, Kentucky and Rockport, Indiana. The William H. Natcher Bridge was named in his honor before he died, although it was not completed until 2002.

Also named in Natcher&#x27;s honor is Interstate 165, the William H. Natcher Expressway, a Kentucky Interstate highway (formerly a toll road) that runs between Bowling Green and Owensboro. From its 1972 opening until 1997, the road was known as the Green River Parkway, then the William H. Natcher Parkway until the Interstate designation was granted to the road in 2019.

Building 45 of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, is named in his honor.

During his congressional career, Natcher was a passionate believer in libraries and literacy. He fought for continued federal funding for library construction and initiatives. These programs continue today; the Kentucky Library Association presents the William H. Natcher Award annually for acts of philanthropy and support of libraries within the Commonwealth.

==Washington, DC, Metrorail Funding==
Natcher was a pro-highway Congressman, encouraging road projects, including in the District of Columbia. From 1970 to 1973, he repeatedly held up funding for the Washington Metro system, delaying its construction until 1973, when he lost a vote to block Metro funding. Natcher refused to allow federal funding for the Washington DC Metro until Arlington County officials agreed to have I-66 go through North Arlington neighborhoods.

In addition, Natcher sought construction of the controversial Three Sisters Bridge, demanding the project begin construction before funds could be released to WMATA. Eventually, a coalition of Congressmen led by Robert Giaimo circumvented Natcher, preventing construction of the Bridge.

<text>Samuel George Montague Nathan (20 January 1895 – 16 July 1937) was an English soldier who served in the British Army during World War I, the Royal Irish Constabulary&#x27;s Auxiliary Division during the Anglo-Irish War and the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. During his service in the Auxiliary Division, Nathan was suspected of being involved in the assassination of two Sinn Féin politicians, which later contributed to the alienation of Irish volunteers in the International Brigades from their British counterparts during the Spanish Civil War. 

In the Spanish Civil War, Nathan initially commanded the British company of the majority-French Marseillaise Battalion but was appointed battalion commander in early 1937 following the execution of his predecessor for espionage. Nathan later became Chief of Staff of the XV International Brigade and was killed in action on 16 July 1937 at the Battle of Brunete. Even though he had been turned down in his attempt to join the Communist Party of Great Britain either because of his &quot;sexual orientation&quot; or because of his unwillingness to &quot;pretend great political enthusiasm&quot; - Comintern observers admired him for his &quot;cool arrogance under fire&quot;.

==Background==
Samuel George Montague Nathan was born in Hackney, London in 1895. His father was Jewish and the Nathans had been settled in England since the 18th century. His mother was an Englishwoman and was a Christian. George Nathan himself was baptised into the Church of England at St Mark&#x27;s, Bow Street on 24 January 1897. Although nominally raised an Anglican and identifying himself as such earlier in life, after 1917 he referred to himself as Jewish.

==Military==

===World War I===
During the First World War, he fought in the British Army on the Western Front. He rose from private to company sergeant major and &quot;after three years and 334 days in the service, he was commissioned in the field on 9 April 1917&quot; to become &quot;the only Jewish officer in the Brigade of Guards&quot;. This is what he claimed but Nathan was, as his medal index card shows, commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and was never a CSM.

===Irish War of Independence===

In 1920, Nathan was discharged from the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. On October of that year, Nathan joined the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and was posted to G Company as a Section Leader, being stationed at the Lakeside Hotel in Killaloe, County Clare. The Auxiliary Division was a paramilitary unit of the RIC and fought in the Irish War of Independence against the Irish Republican Army, working heavily in conjunction with paramilitary RIC constables known as the Black and Tans. Nathan was ordered to return to Dublin on 30 April 1921 and left the Auxiliary Division on 2 May 1921, returning to London.

During his service in the Auxiliary Division, Nathan was suspected of being involved with a series of assassinations in Limerick which took place on 7 March 1921, when the sitting mayor of Limerick, Sinn Féin politician George Clancy, councillor and former mayor Michael O&#x27;Callaghan and city clerk Joseph O&#x27;Donoghue were all shot and killed in their homes. Groups of plainclothes men had knocked on the door of each, claiming to be a search party and once inside struggled with each party, shooting them. George Clancy&#x27;s wife Máire, who had struggled with the party before they shot her husband, identified George Nathan in a statement.

An article published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; by Richard Bennett in 1961 stated that two former Auxiliary Division members had anonymously identified Nathan as the killer of the two mayors. Local rumours in Limerick claimed that Leslie Ibbotson was the other man involved, but this has never been proven. Frank Percy Crozier, a former Auxiliary Division officer, wrote in his book &quot;Ireland for Ever&quot; that he agreed with Kathleen O&#x27;Callaghan (wife of one of the men killed, Michael O&#x27;Callaghan) that the mayors were &quot;murdered by police, acting under orders, as part of a plan to &#x27;do away with&#x27; Sinn Fein leaders, and put the blame on Sinn Fein&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
After returning from Dublin, Nathan relinquished his commission and rejoined the British Army; this time the West Yorkshire Regiment as a private, but had left the military by October 1922 at his own request. Having spent his entire adulthood in the military, Nathan was ill-prepared for civilian life. He worked a number of jobs, such as being a doorman for Peter Jones, but was fired after trying to form a trade union. He also worked as a butcher. He briefly rejoined the Army as a private in the Royal Fusiliers but was discharged with ignominy after a Court Martial on 25 May 1926. He traveled to Halifax, Nova Scotia in February 1928, intending to become a farmer, but only found work as a salesman, staying in Canada for some years. His financial state was poor and he wrote to the British Legion in 1935, requesting assistance.

The Spanish Civil War began in the summer of 1936 in the Second Spanish Republic, as a Nationalist insurgency was launched by elements of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces. In September 1936, the Communist International under the control of Joseph Stalin decided to found the International Brigades to assist the sitting Popular Front government (ranging from the bourgeois liberals of the Republican Union to the Marxist-Leninists of the Communist Party of Spain) of the Second Spanish Republic. Nathan elected to travel to Spain in December 1936, where he joined the mostly French Marseillaise Battalion of the XIV International Brigade, as a Captain of the British Company with it.

Nathan&#x27;s first action in the conflict was at the Battle of Lopera. This was a disaster for the International Brigade, in their attempt to take the town of Lopera, they were decimated by local Andalusian &quot;requetés&quot; and the Moroccan &quot;regulares&quot;. 78 of the 145 &quot;British&quot; (which also included Irish) Company died including John Cornford and Ralph Winston Fox. Comintern were embarrassed by this and so André Marty, the political commissar, had Marseillaise Battalion commander Gaston Delasalle executed for &quot;incompetence, cowardice&quot; and being a &quot;fascist spy&quot; (on the recommendation of André Heussler.) That day Nathan had organised a retreat under fire, which saved even more of his men from being killed.

In January 1937, the British Battalion of the XV International Brigade was founded, training at Madrigueras. However, problems emerged when some Irish members were unhappy about being referred to as part of a &quot;British Battalion&quot; (the Communist name of the Saklatvala Battalion had not caught on and the Spanish referred to them even more offensively as &quot;el batallón inglés&quot;). Irish volunteers from the Republican Congress also found out that they were subordinated to two former members of the Auxiliary Division from the Anglo-Irish War; Nathan and Wilfred Macartney. The tension was such that Nathan, confronted, said to Frank Ryan and the other Irishmen that he had indeed served the Auxiliaries in County Limerick.&quot;If you want to shoot me for what happened in Ireland, all right, but I was under orders.&quot;Nathan denied being a fascist, saying he had come to Spain to fight fascism and that &quot;we are Socialists together now.&quot; Joe Monks claims that, &quot;the meeting responded to the spirit of his speech and clapped him.&quot; Nevertheless, later that month the Irish volunteers voted 26 for and 11 against the motion to instead join the American Lincoln Battalion as the Connolly Column.

Nathan&#x27;s purported homosexuality did not go down well with the Communist International representatives (being then defined in official Marxist–Leninist terminology as a &quot;fascist perversion&quot;) and though he professed a vague allegiance to socialism, he was not a hardcore Marxist–Leninist and had not been a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain before arriving in Spain. However, he proved to be generally popular among the rank and file of the International Brigades, according to the likes of Jason Gurney and Fred Copeman. Aside from this, as a man with proven military experience, he was an asset at a time when the British volunteers consisted mostly of people with little prior training.

According to Copeman, Nathan performed well during the Battle of Jarama in February, one of the most heated contests of the Spanish Civil War. Particularly on the third day, he is claimed to have been the most capable officer of the XV International Brigade. During this battle, the Brigade lost more than half of their men; 375 out of 600 died; including Christopher Caudwell. Nathan finally came unstuck at the Battle of Brunete where he was killed as a result of bomb fragments from a Junkers Ju 88 aerial bombardment and died on the 17 July 1937. Romantic myth claims he was &quot;buried under olive trees close to the River Guadarrama,&quot; but he was actually buried in the village cemetery of Torrelodones, which was along the way on an evacuation route for the combat wounded and dead from Brunete to Madrid.

<text>George Jean Nathan (February 14, 1882 – April 8, 1958) was an American drama critic and magazine editor. He worked closely as an editor with H. L. Mencken bringing the literary magazine &quot;The Smart Set&quot; to prominence and while co-founding and editing &quot;The American Mercury&quot; and &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Nathan was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on February 14, 1882, the son of Ella (Nirdlinger) and Charles Naret Nathan. He was graduated from Cornell University in 1904. There, he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society and an editor of &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot;. 

== Relationships and marriage ==
Nathan had a reputation as a &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot; and the character of Addison De Witt, the waspish theater critic who squires a starlet (played by a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe) in the 1950 film &quot;All About Eve&quot; was based on Nathan. 

Beginning in the late 1920s, Nathan had a romantic relationship with actress Lillian Gish that lasted almost a decade. Gish repeatedly refused his proposals of marriage.
At age 73 in 1955, Nathan married Julie Haydon (1910—1994). She was a stage and film actress who debuted on Broadway in 1935. A collection of Nathan-Haydon papers was donated by his wife to the La Crosse Public Library archives in La Crosse, Wisconsin, her residence at the time of her death. 

== Death ==
Nathan died in Manhattan in 1958, aged 76. He and his wife are buried together in the Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York.

== Legacy ==
He wrote only one play, the one-act play entitled &quot;The Eternal Mystery&quot;, which premiered in 1913 at the Princess Theatre in Manhattan. Owen Hatteras referred to the play as a failure when he quipped that Nathan had &quot;...forbidden the production of the play henceforth in any American city save Chicago, in which city anyone who chooses may perform it without payment of royalties&quot;.

Walter Winchell opened one of his 1937 columns with a reference to Nathan as &quot;a tough critic&quot;. An honor in dramatic criticism, the George Jean Nathan Award, is named after him. Nathan was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Often, comments by Nathan are quoted. One example, cited in 2025, is: &quot;Patriotism is often an arbitrary veneration of real estate above principles.&quot;.

=== Papers ===
Separate from the collection of papers with his wife, Nathan bequeathed a collection of his letters and papers to Cornell University. Among the papers at Cornell are several letters he received from Eugene O&#x27;Neill.

<text>Stenhousemuir (; ) is a town in the Central Lowlands of Scotland. It lies within the Falkirk council area of Scotland. The town is north-northwest of Falkirk and directly adjoins to Larbert in the west, where the nearest rail access is located. The villages of Carron and Carronshore adjoin Stenhousemuir to the east but to a lesser extent. Historically, Stenhousemuir lies with the historic county of Stirlingshire. At the 2001 census it showed that it had a resident population of 10,351 but according to a 2009 estimate this was revised to around 10,190 residents. The combined population of the four localities in 2011 was 24,722, representing about 15% of the Falkirk council area total.

In 2008, a £15 million town centre development scheme was completed and opened which provided a new civic square, a library and large retailing outlets for Stenhousemuir.

==History==
The &quot;stone house&quot; from which the village took its name was a Roman building on the north of the Carron River Valley known in later centuries as Arthur&#x27;s O&#x27;on, i.e. King Arthur&#x27;s oven. It is no longer to be seen, having been demolished to rebuild a dam on the River Carron by Sir Michael Bruce of Stenhouse in 1743. The stones were swept away in a flood soon after. Detailed drawings had been made in the 1720s and a replica was made in 1763 to serve as a dovecote on the roof of the stable block of Penicuik House in Midlothian, and this remains. The site of the original building has been localised to the garden of a modern house on a housing estate, apparently by the American academic Norma Lorre Goodrich (1917–2006).

Stenhousemuir became home to the &quot;Falkirk Tryst&quot; from 1785 - one of the largest gatherings of livestock farmers and buyers from all over Scotland and beyond. After the decline of the Tryst in Crieff, the Falkirk Tryst came to be held more frequently, on the second Tuesdays of August, September and October each year. Thomas Gisbourne in his &quot;Essay on Agriculture&quot; described the Tryst in 1849 as &quot;a scene to which Great Britain, perhaps even the whole world, does not afford a parallel&quot;. The Trysts continued until the late 19th century. R.B. Cunninghame Graham&#x27;s sketch &quot;The Falkirk Tryst&quot; was anthologised in &quot;A Hatchment&quot; in 1913.

The town was home to the McCowan&#x27;s toffee factory, established in 1922, who made both traditional toffee and also the Wham Bar.

==Sport==

Stenhousemuir F.C. play football at Ochilview Park and are currently in Scottish League One. The Tryst Golf Club, built in 1885, has its clubhouse in Burnhead Road, which is arguably in Larbert.

The Cricket Club has been in existence since 1876. It has produced international players representing Scotland and had a number of notable cricket professionals playing for the club e.g. Abdul Qadir.

==Landmarks==
Ochilview, Falkirk Tryst Golf Club and Stenhousemuir Cricket Club are all accessible via Tryst Road, leading north out of the village. The street is so called because it was the site of the annual Tryst. On the anniversary of the Tryst in September each year, a travelling funfair comes to the site.

There are four churches in the village: nearer the centre of the village is Larbert East Church with its imposing tower, meanwhile one third of a mile to the east of the village centre on the aptly named Church Street is the Stenhouse and Carron church which is smaller but more distinctive architecturally, designed in 1897 by the firm of John James Burnet. The village is home to a Salvation Army church and community centre housed in a modern building adjacent to Stenhousemuir Primary school. Further west along Main Street lies the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette. Larbert West church sits just across the old boundary of Burnhead Road between Stenhousemuir and South Broomage.

The shopping area of Stenhousemuir was renovated in 2008. A new library with community area, football pitch and new shops including a Asda supermarket alongside relocation of a number of existing businesses.

Part of the regeneration resulted in construction of a new community centre and rebuild of the medical centre which provides additional NHS support services to the area.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Matthew Nathan (3 January 1862 – 18 April 1939) was a British soldier and colonial administrator, who variously served as the governor of Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, Hong Kong, Natal and Queensland. He was Under-Secretary for Ireland from 1914 to 1916, and was responsible, with the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell, for the administration of Ireland in the years immediately preceding the Easter Rising.

==Early life and career==
Nathan was born in Paddington, London, England. He was of Jewish descent and the second son of businessman Jonah Nathan and Miriam Jacob Nathan. His brothers were Colonel Sir Frederick Nathan, an officer of the Royal Artillery and sometime Superintendent of Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, and Sir Nathaniel Nathan, a colonial judge in Trinidad and Tobago.

Nathan was educated at Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he was the winner of the Pollock Medal (1880) before being gazetted to Royal Engineers in 1880. He continued his training at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham from 1880 to 1884.

Nathan was sent to military expeditions to Sudan (1884–1885) and to Lushai, India (1889–1894). He was promoted to the position of captain in 1889 and became the secretary to the Colonial Defence Committee between 1896 and 1898. Nathan was promoted to major in 1898.

==Colonial career==

Nathan was appointed acting governor of Sierra Leone from 1899 to 1900. Late that year, he was appointed as Governor of Gold Coast, a position he occupied until 1903. In 1902, Nathan imported into the Gold Coast a £543 French Gardner-Serpollet, paraffin-fired, steam-driven car for his use on the roads around Accra. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

In 1903, Nathan was appointed as Governor of Hong Kong, a position he would serve until 1907. During his tenure, Nathan made use of his engineering background to establish a central urban planning and reconstruction policy. He built a major thoroughfare in the marshy area of the Kowloon Peninsula; derided at the time as &quot;Nathan&#x27;s Folly&quot;, it developed into a major shopping avenue, afterwards named Nathan Road. The construction of Kowloon-Canton Railway started under this period.

In 1907, Nathan was made Governor of Natal (until 1909). In that same year, he was raised to a higher rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1909 he returned to England and took up an appointment as secretary to the General Post Office, a position he served until 1911. He was chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue between 1911 and 1914.

==Under-Secretary for Ireland==
Nathan was appointed Under-Secretary for Ireland in late 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I and the signing into law of the Home Rule Act 1914. His immediate superior was the Chief Secretary, Augustine Birrell. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was then largely a ceremonial position, and the Chief Secretary spent much of his time in London, where he was a member of the cabinet. Therefore, the Under-Secretary was effectively the head of the administration in Ireland.

Nathan&#x27;s job involved liaising with the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) to prepare them for self-government. He was also concerned with recruiting in Ireland, and received regular reports from the police and military about anti-recruiting and pro-independence activity, including the threat of a German invasion or arms landing in support of an Irish rising. 

Alarmed at the growing numbers of separatists in the Civil Service, Nathan wrote to the authorities to have them transferred to England, and eventually got cabinet approval for a letter warning civil servants that they would be dismissed if they continued as members of the Irish Volunteers. He used the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 to suppress newspapers that he considered seditious, against the advice of the IPP In general, however, he avoided any action that might provoke violence.

On 21 April 1916, Nathan was informed that a German boat had been stopped off the coast of County Kerry carrying arms and ammunition and that a man had been arrested after coming ashore from another vessel. The man arrested was subsequently identified as Sir Roger Casement 

A mobilization of the Irish Volunteers fixed for Easter Sunday was cancelled the day before. Nathan, believing that a rising had been averted, rejected the insistent urging of the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wimborne, to order the arrest of a large number of rebel leaders and the necessity of raiding premises associated with the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army. Nathan cabled Birrell, the Chief Secretary, in London regarding Wilborne&#x27;s demands. On Easter Monday, while he was in his office in Dublin Castle, the Easter Rising broke out and Dublin Castle itself was attacked. An elderly unarmed sentry, Constable O&#x27;Brien, was shot dead by Sean Connolly. A passing priest administered the last rites. 

The Castle gates were closed, and the rebels did not press the attack, but Nathan was a virtual prisoner until troops arrived from the Curragh Camp on Monday evening. Nathan remained in the Castle for the rest of the week (being moved to the stables to accommodate the military), where he kept in contact with London, keeping the government up to date with the situation and helping to answer questions in Parliament.

The Rising came to an end on 30 April. The same day, Birrell offered his resignation, and on 3 May, at Birrell&#x27;s request, Nathan also resigned. The Royal Commission on the 1916 Rebellion (the Hardinge commission) was critical of Birrell and Nathan, in particular their failure to take action against the rebels in the weeks and months before the Rising.

==Later career==

After his resignation, Nathan was appointed secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, a position he held until 1919. In 1920, he was appointed Governor of Queensland and served in that position until 1925. It was to be his last post in the Colonial Service. During his tenure, Nathan actively promoted British migration to Queensland. 

In 1922, he founded, along with Henry Caselli Richards, the Great Barrier Reef Committee. He was chancellor of the University of Queensland in 1922–25 and was awarded an honorary LL.D. in 1925. 

After his appointment as governor expired, Nathan left Queensland for retirement in Somerset, England, where he died in the village of West Coker in 1939. He was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery, London.

==Honours==
*Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, 1902
*Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, 1908

==Places named after him==
Nathan Road, the main commercial artery in the Kowloon Peninsula (otherwise known as the Golden Mile), was named after him. 

In Australia, Nathan and Nathan Heights in Brisbane (the capital city of Queensland) and Nathan Street in the Canberra suburb of Deakin were named after him. 

Nathan House, a boarding house for Form 2 learners at Maritzburg College in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa is named in his honour. 

Scottburgh, South Africa has a street named after Sir Matthew Nathan.

<text>Theodora Nathalia &quot;Tonie&quot; Nathan (February 9, 1923 – March 20, 2014) was an American radio producer, television producer, and political activist. She was the first woman to receive an electoral vote in a United States presidential election. She was the 1972 vice presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party and running mate of John Hospers, when Roger MacBride, a Republican elector from Virginia, cast the historic vote as a faithless elector.

==Background==
Nathan was born in 1923 to Jewish parents in New York City. Her last name at birth was Nathan, and she married a man, Charles Nathan, who had the same last name.

She operated her own insurance agency, a music publishing firm and a decorating service in the Los Angeles area before moving to Eugene, Oregon. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism from the University of Oregon in 1971. Nathan then worked as a radio and television producer. She produced and occasionally hosted a daily talk show on KVAL-TV (CBS affiliate) in Eugene.

==Political campaigns==
===1972 vice-presidential nomination===
At the first presidential nominating convention of the Libertarian Party in 1972, Nathan was nominated by the convention delegates to run for vice president with presidential candidate John Hospers, chairman of the philosophy department at the University of Southern California. While the ticket received only 3,674 official votes out of more than 75 million votes cast, Republican elector Roger MacBride of Virginia chose to vote for Hospers and Nathan instead of Nixon and Agnew. As a result, Nathan became the first woman and the first Jew in American history to have received an electoral vote in a presidential election. (Although Barry Goldwater was half-Jewish by ethnicity, he was not Jewish by religion, as he was raised in the Episcopalian faith of his mother; Goldwater received his electoral votes 8 years before Nathan received hers.)

Nathan and Hospers campaigned on a platform of minimal government intervention.

===1976 vice-presidential candidacy===
Nathan consented to have her name put forward for the Libertarian vice-presidential nomination in the 1976 presidential election, though she did not actively campaign for the position. She lost that nomination to Jim Lewis.

=== 1992 Oregon State Senate campaign ===
Nathan ran against Democrat Bill Dwyer in the 1992 Oregon State Senate election to represent Oregon&#x27;s 21st House district. She lost, receiving 17.3% of the vote compared to Dwyers&#x27; 82.7%.

===Senate and House of Representatives campaigns===
Following her vice-presidential run, she made a series of unsuccessful runs as a Libertarian candidate during the 1970s through the 1990s, for offices including the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.
In the 1980 U.S. Senate election, Nathan participated in three statewide television debates with incumbent Bob Packwood and then-State Senator Ted Kulongoski. She received 43,686 votes for 3.83% of the vote.
In 1990 Nathan ran as a Libertarian candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives for Oregon&#x27;s 4th congressional district. She was the lone challenger to incumbent Congressman Peter DeFazio and received 26,432 votes for 14% of the vote.

Nathan ran unsuccessfully for the Oregon State Senate in 1992 and 1998.

==Other political activities==
Nathan was a founding member and former vice chair of the Libertarian Party, as well as a founding member and former president of the Association of Libertarian Feminists. She was a speaker at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, where she also announced Gary Johnson as the 2012 Libertarian Party presidential nominee.

==Views==
Nathan was originally a Democrat until one of her sons, Paul, gave her some writings by Ayn Rand. That helped spur his mother’s political views of freedom, free markets and individuality, and prompted her to switch her political allegiance from the Democratic to Libertarian Party, Paul said. She attended the party&#x27;s first national convention in 1972 in Colorado as an interested observer and freelance writer, but was ultimately asked to join the party&#x27;s national ticket as a running mate. Throughout the years, Nathan championed a number of social and fiscal issues such as ending the military draft and the war on drugs, advocating historic preservation, abortion rights and a flat tax.

During the 2004 presidential election, Nathan wrote a column for &quot;LewRockwell.com&quot; saying that Americans &quot;should vote their consciences and pick the candidate who best represents their values.&quot; She also stated, &quot;It makes you wonder, doesn&#x27;t it. What is the major news media afraid of? Could it be that most Americans share the Libertarian ideals of Republican fiscal conservatism (reducing the size and cost of government) and Democratic social liberalism (allowing citizens control over their personal lives)? Perhaps such Libertarian views represent a genuine threat to both major parties…&quot; and &quot;It is possible that during the coming debates President Bush or Senator Kerry will discuss the many issues that created reasons for new political parties to form – issues on environmentalism, a possible draft, the Drug War, abortion and gay rights, the falling dollar, immigration laws, foreign policy principles, the unwieldy IRS code and the Supreme Court&#x27;s adherence to the Constitution.&quot;

==Personal life==
Nathan was married to Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Nathan, an ASCAP composer who wrote top-ten hit songs in the 1950s. They were married from 1942 until his death in 2012. The couple had three sons.

===Death===
Nathan died on March 20, 2014, at the age of 91 from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Daniel Nathans (October 30, 1928 – November 16, 1999) was an American microbiologist. He shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of restriction enzymes and their application in restriction mapping.

==Early life and education==
Nathans was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the last of nine children born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, Sarah (Levitan) and Samuel Nathans. During the Great Depression his father lost his small business and was unemployed for a long time.

Nathans attended public schools and then to the University of Delaware, where he received his BS degree in chemistry in 1950. He received his MD degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1954 and did a one-year internship at Presbyterian Medical Center with Robert Loeb.

Wanting a break before his medical residency, Nathans became a clinical associate at the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. There he split his time between caring for patients receiving experimental cancer chemotherapy and research on recently discovered plasma-cell tumors in mice, similar to human multiple myeloma. Struck by how little was known about cancer biology, he became interested in protein synthesis in myeloma tumors, and published his first papers on this research.

Nathans returned to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center for a two-year residency in 1957, again on Robert Loeb&#x27;s service. He continued working on the problem of protein synthesis as time allowed. In 1959, he decided to work on the research full time and became a research associate at Fritz Lipmann&#x27;s lab at the Rockefeller Institute in New York.

==Career==

In 1962, Nathans came to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as an assistant professor of microbiology. He was promoted to associate professor in 1965 and to professor in 1967. He became the director of the microbiology department in 1972 and served in that position until 1982. In 1981, the department of microbiology was renamed the department of molecular biology and genetics.

In 1982 Johns Hopkins University made Nathans a University Professor, a position in which he served until his death in 1999. He also became a senior investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute unit at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1982.

From 1995 to 1996, Nathans served as the interim president of Johns Hopkins University.

In January 1999, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine established the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, a multidisciplinary clinical and research center named for Nathans and pioneering medical geneticist Victor McKusick.

Nathans was also given six honorary doctorates over the span of his career.

==Awards==

* 1967: Selman Waksman Award in Microbiology
* 1976: NAS Award in Molecular Biology
* 1977: Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
* 1978: Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

<text>Alfred Gabriel Nathorst (7 November 1850 – 20 January 1921) was a Swedish Arctic explorer, geologist, and palaeobotanist.

==Life==
He was born in Väderbrunn in Sweden. Nathorst&#x27;s interest in geology was awakened by Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; and, at the age of 21, Nathorst visited Lyell in England in 1872.

Nathorst was employed at the Geological Survey of Sweden in 1873–84. He was then appointed professor, by royal decree on the 5 December 1884, and was simultaneously made curator of the new &quot;Department of Archegoniates and Fossil Plants&quot; at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. He remained at this post until his retirement in 1917.

Nathorst visited Spitsbergen in 1870 and in 1882–83 he participated in the &quot;Second Dickson expedition&quot; (&quot;Den andra Dicksonska Expeditionen till Grönland&quot;) led by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. He led an expedition on the ship &quot;Antarctic&quot; to Bear Island and Svalbard including the isolated Kong Karls Land in 1898. The following year (1899), Nathorst led an expedition to Greenland. This second expedition had the dual purpose of geographical mapping and of searching for survivors of S. A. Andrée&#x27;s Arctic balloon expedition of 1897. The Andreé expedition was not found, however Nathorst found and mapped the Antarctic Sound, a fjord branch connecting Kaiser Franz Joseph Fjord to the north with the head of King Oscar Fjord to the south. The two expeditions are described in two volumes &quot;Två somrar i Norra Ishavet&quot; (in Swedish).

Starting with macrofossil deposited in glacial clay found in Scania in 1871, Nathorst investigated postglacial development in plants. He also researched plant remains from older geological eras, such as the palaeozoic and mesozoic from the Arctic and tertiary from Japan. These investigations made him an internationally acknowledged authority on palaeobotany.

Nathorst had a scientific dispute with Eugen Warming over the history of the flora of Greenland. Warming hypothesised that part of the flora had survived the last glaciation – the nunatak hypothesis, while Nathorst considered that the entire flora had immigrated anew after the glaciation – the tabula rasa hypothesis. 

He was an elected member of many learned societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1885). He died on 20 January 1921.

==Legacy==
A number of plant, animal and fungal species have been named to his honour, e.g. &quot;Saxifraga nathorstii&quot; (Dusén) Hayek (East Greenland saxifrage) and a suite of fossil plant species, &quot;Williamsonia nathorstii&quot; Carruthers (a fossil dragonfly) and &quot;Laestadites nathorstii&quot; Mesch. (a fossil fungus).

Nathorst Land in East Central Greenland is named after him.
On Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Nathorst Land and Nathorstbreen are named after him. Also Alfredfjellet, a mountain at the island of Bjørnøya, is named after him.

<doc id="762603" wikidata="Q4571051" url="?curid=762603" title="1963 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1963 Atlantic hurricane season was a slightly below average season in terms of tropical cyclone formation, with a total of ten nameable storms. Even so, it was also a notoriously deadly and destructive season. The season officially began on June 15, 1963, and lasted until November 15, 1963. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed over the Bahamas on June 1. 

In late July, Hurricane Arlene, developed between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The storm later impacted Bermuda, where strong winds resulted in about $300,000 (1963 USD) in damage. During the month of September, Tropical Storm Cindy caused wind damage and flooding in Texas, leaving three deaths and approximately $12.5 million in damage. Hurricane Edith passed through the Lesser Antilles and the eastern Greater Antilles, causing 10 deaths and about $43 million in damage, most of which occurred on Martinique.

The most significant and deadliest system of the season was Hurricane Flora, which peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Drifting slowly and executing a cyclonic loop, Flora dropped very heavy rainfall in the Greater Antilles, including over in Cuba. Extreme flooding ensued, leaving behind at least 7,193 fatalities and about $773.4 million in damage. In October, Hurricane Ginny moved erratically offshore the Southeastern United States, though eventually, the extratropical remnants struck Nova Scotia. Ginny caused at least three deaths and $400,000 in damage in the United States alone. The final cyclone, Tropical Storm Helena, caused five deaths and over $500,000 in damage on Guadeloupe. Overall, the storms in this season caused at least 7,214 deaths and about $833.8 million in damage.

== Season summary ==
The 1963 hurricane season officially began on June 15 and ended on November 15. It was an average season with ten tropical storms, slightly above the 1950–2000 average of 9.6 named storms. Seven of these reached hurricane status, which is above the 1950–2000 average of 5.9. Furthermore, three storms reached major hurricane status, which is Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early in the season, activity was suppressed by an abnormally intense trough offshore the East Coast of the United States as well as strong westerly winds. Later, tropical cyclone formation occurred more often after a portion of the trough weakened and easterly flow increased across much of the Atlantic. The tropical cyclones of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season collectively caused at least 7,214 deaths and $833.8 million in damage.

Tropical cyclogenesis began early, an unnamed tropical storm developing on June 1. However, activity ceased for nearly two months, before Arlene formed on July 31. Another system formed in August, Hurricane Beulah. September was much more active, with Cindy, Debra, an unnumbered tropical depression. Edith, and Flora all developing in that month. Flora was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, peaking as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . There were two other system in October, Hurricane Ginny and Tropical Storm Helena; the latter dissipated on October 30.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an above average accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 113. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Unnamed tropical storm ===

Toward the end of May, a tropical disturbance moved northward from Panama toward the western Caribbean Sea. On May 31, a trough moved across eastern Cuba. On June 1, a tropical depression developed over the western Bahamas. Initially, the depression could have been a subtropical cyclone, due to an upper-level low located over the circulation. The depression moved to the northeast and later to the north, strengthening into a tropical storm on June 2. A day later, the storm attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h); on the same day, the storm made landfall just west of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. By June 4, the storm weakened to a tropical depression as it continued northwestward through Virginia, Maryland, and finally Pennsylvania, where the depression degenerated into a trough.

The disturbance dropped heavy rainfall across Cuba, reaching in Santiago de Cuba. The storm produced gusty winds along the eastern United States coast, from North Carolina through Maryland. Winds reached 40 mph (65 km/h) in Ocean City, Maryland and 39 mph (64 km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia. The latter city recorded of rainfall in a 24-hour period, setting a daily rainfall record for the location. Heavy rainfall reached as far north as Washington, D.C.
=== Hurricane Arlene ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on July 31 while located about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. It headed west, becoming Tropical Storm Arlene on August 2. Shortly thereafter, Arlene turned to the northeast and bypassed the Lesser Antilles. Around 00:00 UTC on August 5, Arlene weakened back to a tropical depression. Based on ship data and reconnaissance aircraft flights being unable to locate a circulation, Arlene degenerated into a trough about 24 hours later. Observations from ships indicated that the system became a tropical depression again early on August 7. Several hours later, Arlene became a tropical storm again. While curving to the northeast on August 8, the cyclone intensified into a hurricane.

Arlene intensified further on August 9 and was a strong Category 2 hurricane by the time it struck Bermuda with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) at 15:30 UTC. Shortly thereafter, the system became a Category 3 hurricane and peaked with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Arlene weakened and lost tropical characteristics as it continued northeastward, becoming extratropical early on August 11 about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical remnants turned east-southeastward and persisted for a few days, until dissipating just north of Madeira on August 14. Several hurricane warnings and watches were issued for the Leeward Islands; however, no damage was reported on any of the islands. The storm had its greatest impact on Bermuda, where high winds and near-record rainfall of downed trees, power lines, and caused flooding. Damages across the island amounted to $300,000.
=== Hurricane Beulah ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 11. The system organized into a tropical depression early on August 20 about northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana. On August 21, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beulah while moving to the northwest. Later that day, the first reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm observed winds of . Based on another reconnaissance flight on August 22 observing a barometric pressure of , Beulah intensified into a hurricane around 18:00 UTC. The storm intensified into a Category 3 hurricane by early on August 24, at which time Beulah attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Radar imagery depicted an elliptical eye with a diameter of .

Early on August 25, Beulah weakened significantly due to unfavorable conditions caused by an anticyclone to its south, falling to Category 1 intensity. After leveling off to sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) several hours later, Beulah maintained this intensity for the next few days. Early on August 26, the hurricane turned northeastward under the influence of an upper-level trough offshore the East Coast of the United States. At 00:00 UTC on August 28, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical low eventually turned eastward towards western Europe. The remnants then moved erratically, striking Ireland, the United Kingdom twice, and France before entering the North Sea. On September 8, the remnants finally dissipated north of Jan Mayen.
=== Unnamed hurricane ===

As early as September 8, ships north of Puerto Rico reported a weak circulation. Drifting northward, the system developed tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on September 9, while situated about northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands. The cyclone was subtropical in nature, fueled by both latent heat and instability from contrasting cool and warm air masses. While passing Bermuda later on September 10, sustained wind speeds of and decrease in barometric pressure were observed. The system moved east-northeastward and strengthened into a tropical storm late on September 10. The cyclone intensified further and reached hurricane status early on September 12, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Around that time, the &quot;Freiburg&quot; observed winds of . Thereafter, the system weakened to a tropical storm about 24 hours later and accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front. Around 12:00 UTC on September 14, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone while located about north-northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores.
=== Tropical Storm Cindy ===
In mid-September, a trough of low pressure was situated in the Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Storm Cindy at 12:00 UTC on September 16, while located about south of Cameron, Louisiana. Cindy strengthened while moving north-northwestward. Around that time, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Around 14:00 UTC on September 17, Cindy made landfall near High Island, Texas, at that intensity. After landfall, Cindy weakened to a tropical depression within about 22 hours. Turning southwest, the depression dissipated near Alice, Texas, at 00:00 UTC on September 20.

In southwestern Louisiana, over of rain fell in some areas. Rice crops were flooded, causing about $360,000 in damage. However, the precipitation was described as more beneficial than detrimental. Along the coast, tides inundated roads leading to Cameron and Holly Beach. A man drowned offshore Cameron while evacuating from an oil rig. The storm brought flooding to the southeastern Texas, particularly in and around Port Arthur. Two people drowned in the Port Acres area. Water entered 4,000 homes across Jefferson, Newton, and Orange counties. In Oklahoma, flooding in Guthrie prompted 300 residents to flee their homes; water intruded into 25 businesses and 35 homes. Overall, Cindy caused about $12.5 million in damage, of which $11.7 million stemmed from property damage.
=== Hurricane Debra ===

On September 19, a westward moving tropical wave became a tropical depression about east of the southwesternmost islands of Cape Verde. The depression moved northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Debra early the next day. Despite the system&#x27;s intensity at the time, a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed a radar eye on September 20. On the next day, Debra curved northward and intensified into a hurricane around 18:00 UTC. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Debra soon began weakening and fell to tropical storm status late on September 22. The system continued weakening and dissipated late on September 24, while located about halfway between Bermuda and Flores Island in the Azores.
=== Hurricane Edith ===
An Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) disturbance developed into a tropical depression while east of the Windward Islands on September 23. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith early the next day. Several hours later, Edith intensified into a hurricane. Around 00:00 UTC on September 25, the cyclone became a Category 2 hurricane just north of Barbados and peaked with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Seven hours later, Edith struck Saint Lucia at the same intensity. The storm traversed the eastern Caribbean Sea and weakened to a tropical storm early on September 26. Edith then turned northwestward and briefly became a hurricane again, but weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall near La Romana, Dominican Republic, at 10:00 UTC the next day. Interaction with land and an upper-level trough caused Edith to weaken considerably before it emerged into the Atlantic on September 28. Several hours later, Edith struck Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands as a tropical storm. The storm weakened to a tropical depression and became extratropical just east of the Bahamas on September 29. The extratropical low was soon absorbed by an extratropical system developing offshore the East Coast of the United States.

In Martinique, a wind gust of was observed at Le Lamentin Airport; tides about above normal and heavy rainfall impacted the island. Throughout the island, about 6,000 homes were demolished and 13,000 other were severely impacted. Agriculture suffered significantly, with bananas and other food crops destroyed, while sugar cane experienced significant damage. Winds up to caused significant damage on Dominica and strong winds on Saint Lucia ruined about half of the island&#x27;s banana crop. In Puerto Rico, the storm brought heavy rainfall to the southwest corner of the island and abnormally high tides to the south coast. Several beach front properties were badly damaged, particularly in the Salinas municipality. Overall, Edith caused 10 deaths, all on Martinique, and approximately $46.6 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Flora ===
A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression well east of the Lesser Antilles at 12:00 UTC on September 28. About 24 hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Flora. The cyclone intensified into a Category 1 hurricane early on September 29 and became a Category 2 hurricane before striking Tobago several hours later. Flora continued west-northwestward into the Caribbean and intensified into a Category 3 hurricane early on October 2 and became a Category 4 about 24 hours later. At 18:00 UTC on October 3, Flora peaked with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). Early the next day, the hurricane made landfall in southwestern Haiti at the same intensity. Flora re-emerged into the Caribbean several hours later as a Category 3 hurricane. Late on October 4, the cyclone made landfall near San Antonio del Sur, Cuba, with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). A ridge to the north caused Flora to stall and move erratically over eastern Cuba for four days. Flora weakened slowly over land, falling to a Category 1 hurricane on October 5, but re-strengthened into a Category 2 after briefly emerging into the Gulf of Guacanayabo. Flora weakened to a tropical storm late on October 7, about 24 hours before emerging into the Atlantic. However, Flora quickly re-strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane and pass through the southeastern Bahamas early on October 9. Thereafter, Flora continued northeastward and gradually weakened, falling to Category 1 intensity on October 11. Flora gradually lost convection and became extratropical on October 12 while located 270 mi (430 km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The extratropical remnants continued north-northeastward until a larger extratropical cyclone absorbed it offshore Greenland on October 17.

In Trinidad and Tobago, abnormally high tides capsized six ships in Scarborough harbor, while strong winds caused severe effects to coconut, banana, and cocoa plantations, with 50% of the coconut trees destroyed and 11% severely damaged. About 2,750 houses were destroyed, while 3,500 others were impacted. The hurricane killed 24 people and resulted in $30.1 million damage. Six additional drowning fatalities occurred in Grenada. The slow movement of the storm resulted in record rainfall totals for the Greater Antilles. In Dominican Republic, over of land was flooded. Bridges and roads were significantly damaged, with many roads left unpassable for several months. The hurricane caused about $60 million in damage and over 400 deaths. In Haiti, flash floods washed out large sections of several towns, while mudslides buried some entire cities. In most areas, crops were entirely destroyed. Additionally, the combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities. About 3,500 people were confirmed dead and damage ranged from $125 million to $180 million. In Cuba, the storm dropped of rainfall at Santiago de Cuba. Nearly all crops in southeastern Cuba were affected by strong winds and flooding. Many citizens were left stranded at the tops of their houses. Several entire houses were swept away by the flooding, and many roads and bridges were destroyed, resulting in major disruptions to communications. Throughout the country, the hurricane destroyed as many as 30,000 dwellings. Flora left at least 1,750 fatalities and $500 million in damage in Cuba. In Jamaica, the storm produced up to of precipitation at Spring Hill. Flora was attributed to 11 deaths and about $11.9 million in damage on the island. In the Bahamas, the storm left damage to crops, property, and roads that exceeded $1.5 million in damage, while one person drowned. Overall, Hurricane Flora caused at least 7,193 deaths and over $783.4 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Ginny ===
Late on October 17, a tropical depression formed near Turks and Caicos from the interaction of a trough and a tropical wave, although the system was not very tropical due to cold air. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ginny early on October 19. The next day, Ginny attained hurricane status, and approached North Carolina before looping to the southwest due to a ridge over New England. By October 22, Ginny crossed the Gulf Stream and intensified, developing an eye. Ahead of an advancing trough, Ginny turned sharply northward and later northeastward, paralleling the coast of the Southeastern United States. For eight days, the storm was within of the United States coastline. Moving farther offshore, Ginny gradually intensified and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) late on October 28. Later that day, Ginny made landfall in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, shortly before becoming extratropical. Its remnants dissipated on October 30 over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Early in its existence, Ginny dropped heavy rainfall across the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. In Florida and Georgia, Ginny produced above normal tides that caused minor damage and beach erosion. Rainfall was beneficial in South Carolina, and in North Carolina, high tides caused minor flooding and destroyed one house. In Massachusetts, wind gusts reached in Nantucket, and 1,000 homes lost power in Chatham. Ginny was the latest hurricane on record to affect Maine during a calendar year. During its passage, the storm brought an influx of cold air that produced up to of snow in northern Maine, killing two people. Offshore, many boats were damaged or ripped from their moorings; one person died from a heart attack while trying to rescue his boat. Damage from Ginny in the United States was estimated at $400,000. In Canada, high winds downed trees and caused power outages, leaving the entirety of Prince Edward Island without power.
=== Tropical Storm Helena ===

A tropical wave accompanied by a large area of convection moved westward in late October. On October 25, the wave spawned a tropical depression, based on ship and reconnaissance flights reports of southwest winds and heavy rainfall. Although poorly defined, the system gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Helena. Late on October 26, Helena entered the Caribbean after passing between Dominica and Guadeloupe. The storm reached peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 27. Its slow, erratic movement and failure to intensify further was due to a weak trough across the region. Early on October 28, Helena struck Antigua at the same intensity. Around this time, the storm developed an intense rainband that produced winds of , as measured by reconnaissance aircraft between Dominica and Guadeloupe. However, Helena re-emerged into the Atlantic and weakened to a tropical depression on October 29 and dissipated on the following day.

The threat of Helena prompted the San Juan Weather Bureau to issue a hurricane watch and later gale warnings for portions of the Lesser Antilles. On the Guadeloupe, the storm left 500 people homeless, killed 5 people, and seriously injured 14 others. Several boats were heavily damaged or sank. Damage was estimated at $500,000.
=== Other system ===
A tropical wave or trough of low-pressure developed into a tropical depression over the Bay of Campeche on September 23. The depression remained nearly stationary due to a frontal boundary over the northern Gulf of Mexico. On September 26, the depression struck the west coast of the Yucatán Peninsula and re-emerged into the Bay of Campeche on the following day. Ships near the area reported barometric pressures of less than but not gale-force winds. It is unknown if the depression remained a tropical cyclone beyond September 27, though it may have become a subtropical cyclone on September 28. The remnants of the depression became extratropical and moved rapidly northeastward, crossing Florida on September 29 and then dissipating offshore the Northeastern United States by October 1.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1963. Storms were named &quot;Ginny&quot; and &quot;Helena&quot; for the first (and last) time in 1963.

=== Retirement ===
The name &quot;Flora&quot; was later retired. The names &quot;Ginny&quot; and &quot;Helena&quot; were also removed from the naming list. They were replaced with &quot;Fern&quot;, &quot;Ginger&quot; and &quot;Heidi&quot; for the 1967 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1963 USD.

<text>Giulio Natta (; 26 February 1903 – 2 May 1979) was an Italian chemical engineer and Nobel laureate. He won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 with Karl Ziegler for work on high density polymers. He also received a Lomonosov Gold Medal in 1969.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Natta was born in Imperia, Italy. He earned his degree in chemical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano university in Milan in 1924. In 1927 he passed the exams for becoming a professor there. From 1929 to 1933, he was also in charge of physical chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Milan. In 1933 he became a full professor and the director of the Institute of General Chemistry of Pavia University, where he stayed until 1935. During this time he began using crystallography to elucidate the structures of a wide variety of molecules including phosphine, arsine and others. In that year he was appointed full professor in physical chemistry at the University of Rome.

===Career===
From 1936 to 1938 he moved as a full professor and director of the Institute of Industrial Chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Turin. In 1938 he took over as the head of the Department of chemical engineering at the Politecnico di Milano university, in a somewhat controversial manner, when his predecessor Mario Giacomo Levi was forced to step down because of racial laws against Jews being introduced in Fascist Italy.

Natta&#x27;s work at Politecnico di Milano led to the improvement of earlier work by Karl Ziegler and to the development of the Ziegler–Natta catalyst. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963 with Karl Ziegler for their research in high polymers.

===Personal life===

In 1935 Natta married Rosita Beati; a graduate in literature, she coined the terms &quot;isotactic&quot;, &quot;atactic&quot; and &quot;syndiotactic&quot; for polymers discovered by her husband. They had two children, Giuseppe and Franca. Rosita died in 1968.

Natta was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1956. By 1963, his condition had progressed to the point that he required the assistance of his son and four colleagues to present his speech at the Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm. Natta died in Bergamo, Italy at age 76.

<text>This is a list of patrol vessels of the United States Navy.

Ship status is indicated as either currently active [A] (including ready reserve), inactive [I], or precommissioning [P]. Ships in the inactive category include only ships in the inactive reserve, ships which have been disposed from US service have no listed status. Ships in the precommissioning category include ships under construction or on order.

==Assault Support Patrol Boat (ASPB)==

Eighty-six Assault Support Patrol Boats were built for use in the Vietnam War.

==Patrol boat, river (PBR)==

The Patrol Boat, River was acquired for the Vietnam War: 718 of these 31/32-foot long boats were purchased with a peak of 250 used in Vietnam.

==Patrol craft coastal (PC)==

The following submarine chasers were 173/174 feet long and used the PC designation. The large missing sections of these numbers for the most part come from the sharing of the same number sequence with the 110-foot submarine chasers that used the SC designation and the 134-foot patrol craft sweepers that used the PCS designation. This number sequence would end in 1964, and then restart with &#x27;1&#x27; for the &quot;Cyclone&quot;-class costal patrol craft.

===Patrol craft sweeper, control (PCSC)===

Thirteen patrol craft sweepers (PCS) were converted into amphibious landing control vessels during World War II and reclassified as Patrol Craft Sweeper, Control.
==Patrol escort (PE)==
Of 112 planned 60 of these World War I era ships were completed, being given numbers from 1 to 60. Only three were commissioned prior to the Armistice which ended World War I and only eight saw service in World War II of which &quot;PE-56&quot; was sunk by a U-boat.
PE-61 through PE-112 were cancelled on November 30, 1918.
PE-5, PE-15, PE-25, PE-45, PE-65, PE-75, PE-86, PE-95, PE-105, and PE-112 were allotted for transfer to Italy, though this plan was cancelled and none were ever delivered.

==Patrol frigate (PF)==
Destroyer escorts were designed and built to naval construction standards, and as such could only be built at yards experienced with naval standards. The United States Maritime Commission created its S2 design - which was based on the British-designed &quot;River&quot; class - for much the same role but using civilian construction standards. These ships would be classed by the Navy as the &quot;Tacoma&quot; class frigates.

<text>USS &quot;Abercrombie&quot; (DE-343) was a in the service of the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was finally sunk as a target in 1968.

==Namesake==
William Warner Abercrombie was born on 24 July 1914 in Medford, Oregon. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman 2nd class at Kansas City, Kansas, on 27 August 1940. After undergoing elimination flight training at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Kansas City, from 16 September to 5 October, he received an honorable discharge on 24 December 1940, to accept an appointment as an aviation cadet, USNR, on 27 December. Three days later he arrived at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, to begin his formal flight training. He underwent further instruction at Naval Air Station Miami before he received his wings on 10 July 1941. He was appointed Ensign on 4 August 1941, he arrived at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia, for temporary duty. There he joined Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8), established on 2 September 1941 under the command of Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron.

During the Battle of Midway on the morning of 4 June 1942, Waldron led 15 Douglas TBD Devastators, one piloted by Abercrombie, from the &#x27;s flight deck. He located the Imperial Japanese Navy carrier force and led them in on their torpedo runs. VT-8 pressed home a desperate attack in the face of fighters and heavy antiaircraft fire, and all 15 planes were shot down. Abercrombie received a Navy Cross, and a share of VT-8&#x27;s Presidential Unit Citation, posthumously.

==History==
=== Construction and commissioning ===
&quot;Abercrombie&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 8 November 1943 at Orange, Texas by the Consolidated Steel Corporation. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; was launched on 14 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Abercrombie, mother of the late Ensign Abercrombie, and commissioned on 1 May 1944.

===May – October 1944===
The destroyer escort spent the first three weeks of May in the vicinity of Galveston, Texas either at sea in the Gulf of Mexico testing her ordnance and equipment or in port receiving finishing touches in preparation for shakedown training. She conducted her shakedown cruise in the British West Indies late in May and early in June before putting into Boston on 25 June for post-shakedown repairs. Eleven days later, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; headed south to Norfolk where she stopped over on the night of 7 and 8 July. From there the warship took departure for Aruba, a Dutch island off the coast of Venezuela, and a transshipment and refining center for Venezuelan crude oil, in company with , , and . &quot;Abercrombie&quot; and &quot;Walter C. Wann&quot; shepherded the two oilers into port at Aruba late in the evening of 15 July. Two days later after the oilers loaded cargo, the convoy put to sea again.

After seeing &quot;Chepachet&quot; and &quot;Salamonie&quot; safely to the Panama Canal, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; began two weeks of patrol and escort duty in the Caribbean Sea that ended on 1 August when she entered the canal. Following two days of liberty at Balboa, Panama, the destroyer escort got underway for San Diego where she arrived on 11 August. On 22 August, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; set sail for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor a week later. For three weeks, the warship conducted training exercises with escort carriers in the Hawaiian Islands before putting to sea on 19 September to escort to Manus in the Admiralty Islands.

&quot;Abercrombie&quot; and her charge entered Seeadler Harbor at Manus on 30 September. The destroyer escort remained there for two weeks. On 14 October, she returned to sea and joined the screen of an escort carrier task group on its way to provide close air support for the amphibious landings at Leyte in the Philippine Islands. After rendezvousing with a large convoy of amphibious ships and merchantmen off Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea, &quot;Abercrombie&quot;″s group set course for the Philippines. The convoy arrived in Leyte Gulf on 20 October not long after the troops had made the initial landings. Leaving the reinforcement convoy in Leyte Gulf, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; escorted the small carriers to their operating area east of the Philippines.

For the next five days, the destroyer escort screened the carriers against submarine and air attack while their aviators supported the troops on Leyte with close support and interdiction sorties. While not actually engaged in any of the three phases of the Battle for Leyte Gulf fought on 24 and 25 October, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; was close enough for her crew to watch some portions of the phase known as the Battle off Samar on 25 October when a Japanese surface force of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers made a surface gun attack on the escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts of the northernmost elements of her Task Group (TG) 77.4.

===November 1944 – March 1945===
After the excitement of 25 October, the warship spent the remainder of the month screening the escort carriers. She then headed back to Manus in the Admiralty Islands where she arrived on 3 November. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; remained at Manus for most of November, setting sail for the northern Solomons, Bougainville on 28 November. After amphibious landing exercises at Cape Torokina on Bougainville and at Huon Gulf, New Guinea, she returned to Manus to make final preparations for the invasion of Luzon.

On 27 December, the destroyer escort put to sea in company with a large group of amphibious ships. For the invasion of Luzon, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; served as the flagship for TG 79.9, Control Group &quot;Able,&quot; of Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson&#x27;s Task Force (TF) 79, the Lingayen Attack Force. Steaming northwest to Leyte Gulf thence through the Surigao Strait, she passed through the Mindanao Sea around the southern tip of Negros and turned north to transit the Sulu Sea. From that point on to Lingayen Gulf, Japanese aircraft and midget submarines harassed the invasion force. Though enemy aircraft sank several American warships and damaged a number of others, the combat air patrol (CAP) provided a fairly effective umbrella, and only a small percentage of the raiders succeeded in penetrating the aerial shield. As a consequence, &quot;Abercrombie&quot;″s guns remained silent throughout the passage.

On the night of 8 and 9 January 1945, the destroyer escort entered Lingayen Gulf. Early on the morning of the 9th, she steamed in close to shore to take up station as a control ship for the amphibious craft. She anchored about off the main assault beaches near the town of Lingayen. During the final pre-invasion bombardment, &quot;Abercrombie&quot;″s guns opened fire on the enemy for the first time when a kamikaze dived on . In spite of the defensive efforts of the ships around the cruiser, the aircraft succeeded in crashing &quot;Columbia&quot;, the third enemy plane to do so in as many days. Not long thereafter, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; turned to her primary mission as landing craft of the first assault waves formed up on her for the run to the beaches. For most of the morning, landing craft lined up under her direction before starting for the shore.

By 1100, the general lack of resistance on the beaches allowed the transports and cargo ships to move inshore to complete disembarking troops and unloading supplies and equipment. That development freed &quot;Abercrombie&quot; of control ship duties, and she steamed out to join the antiaircraft screen for empty transports awaiting the formation of convoys for the return voyage to rear area bases. That evening, the warship stood out of Lingayen Gulf in the screen of one such convoy and escorted it by way of Leyte to Biak in the Schouten Islands. From there, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; carried out another convoy escort mission, seeing troops and equipment safely to Mindoro in the Philippines. The destroyer escort then voyaged to Ulithi Atoll in the Western Carolines for two weeks of rest and relaxation. At the conclusion of that interlude, she returned to Leyte where she made preparations for and trained for the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands.

On 21 March, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; departed Leyte with TG 51.1 as part of the screen for the Western Islands Attack Group. That unit&#x27;s assignment was to secure Kerama Retto, a group of small islands located to the west of the southern half of Okinawa, before the main assault for use as a fleet anchorage, replenishment area, and temporary repair facility. Her unit, therefore, went into action in the Ryūkyūs a week before the majority of the invasion force. For five days, she provided antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection for the naval units supporting the subjection of that group of islets. On 1 April, attention shifted to the main objective when the landing force stormed ashore on Okinawa itself. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; spent another five days guarding the supporting ships against attack by Japanese submarines and planes.

===April – December 1945===
She cleared the Ryukyu Islands on 5 April in company with Task Unit (TU) 51.29.4 and set a course for the Marianas. The destroyer escort stopped at Saipan from 9 to 11 April and then put to sea in company with bound for Ulithi. After spending the night of 12 and 13 April at Ulithi, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; sortied from the anchorage on 13 April with TG 55.8 for the return voyage to Okinawa.

Arriving back in the Ryūkyūs on 17 April, the destroyer escort spent the next two months performing a variety of services in support of the campaign to wrest Okinawa from the Japanese. During that period, anti-air defense proved to be the most pressing problem. Enemy air power in the form of both kamikaze and conventional raids tested the Navy&#x27;s endurance nearly to the limit. Ships such as &quot;Abercrombie&quot; patrolling the radar picket stations surrounding Okinawa provided early warnings of incoming air raids and bore the brunt of those onslaughts. The destroyer escort tangled with Japanese planes on at least 16 separate occasions, claiming two definite kills and two assists. When not standing watch on a radar picket station, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; conducted antisubmarine searches, rescued downed American airmen, and provided escort services to a variety of ships.

On 14 June, the warship departed the Ryūkyūs in company with TU 31.29.8, bound for the Marianas. She arrived at Saipan four days later and remained there, undergoing routine maintenance while her crew enjoyed some respite from the rigors of duty at Okinawa, until the end of the month. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; returned to sea on 1 July to proceed independently to Okinawa. She reached her destination on 4 July 1945 but remained there only two days. On 6 July, she cleared the Ryūkyūs as a unit of TF 32 to join the US 3rd Fleet in its rampage through Japanese home waters. Over the ensuing three weeks, she screened the larger units of the fleet against a submarine threat that probably did not exist and sank mines. On 31 July, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; returned to Okinawa and resumed antiaircraft and antisubmarine defense duties for a week.

The warship took departure from Okinawa once again on 8 August and shaped a course for Leyte in the Philippines. She entered San Pedro Bay at Leyte on the 11th and commenced a nine-day maintenance period. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; stood out of San Pedro Bay on 20 August and headed back to Okinawa. She stayed in the vicinity of Okinawa from 23 August to 9 September and then embarked upon a voyage to escort occupation forces to Korea. She arrived in Jinsen (now Inchon), Korea, on the 15th and departed again on 17 September. The warship made a three-day stopover at Okinawa between 19 and 22 September and then headed for occupation duty in Japan. &quot;Abercrombie&quot; entered Wakanoura Wan, Honshū, on 24 September, and began six weeks of duty in support of the forces occupying Japan. On 4 November, the destroyer escort concluded her assignment in Japan and laid in a course for the United States. Steaming by way of Pearl Harbor, she entered port at San Pedro, California on 21 November and began preparations for inactivation.

===1946–1968===
Early in 1946, &quot;Abercrombie&quot; was towed to San Diego where she was placed out of commission on 15 June 1946. Berthed with the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, the destroyer escort remained inactive there until sometime in the mid-1950s when she was moved to Bremerton, Washington. On 1 May 1967, her name was struck from the Navy list. In November, she was towed back to San Diego and, on 7 January 1968, the warship was sunk as a target by the guns, missiles, and aircraft of a task group built around off San Diego, California.

==Honors==
&quot;Abercrombie&quot; earned four battle stars during World War II.

<doc id="762613" wikidata="Q76811" url="?curid=762613" title="Friedrich Naumann">
<text>Friedrich Naumann (25 March 1860 – 24 August 1919) was a German liberal politician and Protestant parish pastor. In 1896, he founded the National-Social Association that sought to combine liberalism, nationalism and (non-Marxist) socialism with Protestant Christian values, proposing social reform to prevent class struggle. He led the party until its merger into the Free-minded Union in 1903. From 1907 to 1912 and again from 1913 to 1918, he was a member of the Reichstag of the German Empire.

Naumann advocated an imperialist foreign policy, laying out Germany&#x27;s claim to dominate Central Europe in his 1915 &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; plan. After the First World War, he co-founded the German Democratic Party and was elected to the Weimar National Assembly. Naumann is also somewhat controversial for his anti-Armenian statements. The Friedrich Naumann Foundation of the Free Democratic Party is named after him.

==Life==
Naumann was born in the parsonage of Großpösna near Leipzig in Saxony, being the son of the local Lutheran pastor. He attended school in Leipzig and the &quot;Fürstenschule&quot; in Meissen, whereafter he studied Protestant theology at the universities of Leipzig and Erlangen. In 1881 he was one of the founders of the nationalist student fraternity &quot;Verein Deutscher Studenten&quot; in Leipzig. From 1883 he worked at the &quot;Rauhes Haus&quot; charity institution established by Johann Hinrich Wichern in Hamburg, before in 1886 he took over the rectorate of Lengenberg near Glauchau in Saxony. From 1890 he also served in the Inner mission in Frankfurt.

During the 1880s, Naumann was a follower of the conservative-clerical and antisemitic Berlin movement led by Adolf Stoecker and his Christian Social Party. At the 1890 Evangelical Social Congress however, he became a spokesman of the liberal wing, distancing himself from Stoecker&#x27;s conservatism and antisemitism. Later he became interested in the social theories advocated by his friend Max Weber, one of the most pronounced critics of Emperor Wilhelm II. His ideal was that of helping the workers, whose miserable life circumstances he had witnessed in Hamburg. His goal was to raise interest in this issue among the middle class, however, initially he was hindered by the German middle class fear of the proletariat, who were regarded as potential revolutionaries. Naumann later tried to involve Weber in politics, but this failed due to the bad health and temper of Weber.

Starting from 1894 he published the weekly magazine &quot;Die Hilfe&quot; (&quot;The Help&quot;) to address the social question from a non-marxist middle class point of view. To this end he wrote the short book, &quot;Soziale Briefe An Reiche Leute&quot; (&quot;Social Letters to Wealthy People&quot;) published in Göttingen in 1895.

Together with Rudolph Sohm and Caspar René Gregory, he founded the National-Social Association in 1896; an attempt to provide a social liberal, social Christian and nationalist alternative to the Marxist, predominantly irreligious and internationalist Social Democrats. The Association tried to address the growing social rift between rich industrialists and the poor working class with social reforms rather than class struggle. In the same year, Naumann gave up his pastoral office, concentrating on his political and writing activities from then on. In his 1897 &quot;National-Social Catechism&quot; (structured in rhetorical questions and answers, following the model of &quot;Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism&quot;) he explained the National-Social Association&#x27;s fundamental conviction that &quot;the national and the social (interest) belong together&quot;. By national(ism) he understood &quot;the drive of the German people to expand its influence on the globe&quot;; while he defined social(ism) as &quot;the drive of the working masses to extend their influence within the people&quot;.

During the 1890s Hamidian massacres, Naumann became known for expressing anti-Armenianism in &quot;Die Hilfe&quot; including the famous &quot;potter&#x27;s quote&quot; in which Naumann quoted a German potter, whom he met during his journey to the Near East in Constantinople, as stating: 
Historian Stefan Ihrig states that &quot;Naumann had exposed a very broad audience to justifications for killing Armenians and had made Germany&#x27;s ears deaf to the Armenian plight as well as anti- Armenianism &#x27;morally&#x27; and politically more acceptable&quot;. But with regard to the Armenian genocide in 1915 &quot;Die Hilfe&quot; – still edited and led by Friedrich Naumann – wrote: Later in his life, Naumann worked for an approachment of German social democratic and liberal movements, but faced major opposition from conservatives. Industrialists like Freiherr von Stumm called Naumann and his associates &quot;Allies of the Socialists&quot;. Naumann wanted to preserve Christian values, which he hoped would improve the fraught relations between workers and corporate businessmen. The National-Social Association failed in the German elections of 1898 and 1903 and was then dissolved into the Freeminded Union. Naumann became a member of the Reichstag parliament upon the 1907 federal election.

In 1907, he co-founded the Deutscher Werkbund association. On the eve of World War I, Naumann proved to be a monarchist, but his sympathy for the German emperor Wilhelm II had vanished since the well-known Daily Telegraph Affair of 1908. He espoused a kind of liberal imperialism, signing the 1914 Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, and still in 1918 backed the &quot;Anti-Bolshevist League&quot; of Eduard Stadtler. On the other side Naumann supported the Peace Resolution, with which the Reichstag offered peace negotiations without annexiations in 1917.

In 1919, Friedrich Naumann was among the founders of the social liberal German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei, DDP) with Theodor Wolff and Hugo Preuss. As a member of the Weimar National Assembly, he became one of the &quot;Fathers of the Constitution&quot; of the Weimar Republic, and, shortly before his death, was elected as the first president of the Democratic Party.

==Reception==
Naumann is often considered an advocate of German nationalism with militarist and annexionist ideals, due to his book &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; (1915) on the geopolitics of a Central Europe under German leadership. The work had a great public impact, though it did not affect the military strategy of World War I. Like many scholars of his time, Naumann upheld the theories of Social Darwinism and &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. He shared his views with the intellectual circles he frequented, including not only Max Weber, but also Lujo Brentano, Hellmut von Gerlach, young Theodor Heuss, his wife Elly Heuss-Knapp, and Gustav Stresemann.

For Jürgen Frölich, historian at the Archive of Liberalism, Naumann is &quot;a key figure in German liberalism in the late Kaiserreich&quot;, who saw his political goals mainly realized, when just before the end of war the Constitution of the German Empire adopted an amendment, which turned the state into a short living parliamentary democratic monarchy.

According to the historian Götz Aly, Naumann &quot;distorted liberalism beyond recognition and completed the turn to nationalist power and popular welfare politics&quot;. While Naumann was not a forerunner of the Nazis&#x27; antisemitism, Aly accuses him of having &quot;combined social, imperial, and national thought into a cohesive intellectual current that could eventually blend with the NSDAP&#x27;s mindset&quot;.

<doc id="762615" wikidata="Q311583" url="?curid=762615" title="Yitzhak Navon">
<text>Yitzhak Rachamim Navon (; 9 April 1921 – 6 November 2015) was an Israeli politician, diplomat, playwright, and author. He served as the fifth President of Israel between 1978 and 1983 as a member of the centre-left Alignment party. He was the first Israeli president born in Jerusalem and the first Sephardi Jew to serve in that office.

==Biography==

Navon was born in Jerusalem to Yosef and Miryam Navon, a descendant of a Sephardi Jewish family of rabbis, and had ancestry in Jerusalem going back centuries. On his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from Sephardi Jews who settled in Turkey after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. His ancestors, the Baruch Mizrahi family immigrated from Turkey to Jerusalem in 1670. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from the renowned Moroccan-Jewish kabbalist rabbi Chaim ibn Attar, who immigrated to Israel and settled in Jerusalem in 1742.

In 1924, the Navon family moved from Jaffa Road to the Ohel Moshe neighbourhood in Nachlaot. In 1932, they moved to Sheikh Badr near the western entrance to Jerusalem, relocating to Mekor Baruch in 1936.

He attended the Doresh Tziyon and Takhemoni elementary schools and the Hebrew University high school.

Navon studied Arabic and Islamic studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He taught Hebrew literature for several years. He was fluent in Arabic, Hebrew, Ladino, French and English.

Navon was a member of the Haganah&#x27;s Arab Intelligence Unit and worked undercover in Jerusalem. During the war, he listened to wiretapped conversations of the British Army. Later he was sent by the Israeli foreign service to Uruguay and Argentina to track down Nazis.

Navon was married to Ofira Navon née Resnikov, who died of cancer in 1993. Navon died in Jerusalem at the age of 94 on 6 November, 2015.

==Political career==

In 1951, Navon became the political secretary of Israel&#x27;s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. The following year he was appointed Ben-Gurion&#x27;s bureau chief. He remained in this position under Prime Minister Moshe Sharett. His judgment was crucial to advice the government received during the Suez Crisis and Lavon Affair.

In 1963 Ben-Gurion resigned as prime minister and Navon became a civil service department head at the Ministry of Education and Culture. Navon began a long campaign fighting illiteracy in Israel, which affected about 12% of the Jewish population. It&#x27;s a shame and disgrace that more than 200,000 adults in Israel do not know how to read or write in any language, and we must do everything possible to erase this stain from us. Navon ordered the mobilisation of hundreds of female soldiers serving compulsory national service to teach illiterate adults to read and write Hebrew. Two years later, Navon was elected to the Knesset as a member of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s Rafi. The new party which had dared challenge the Mapai establishment was driven by &#x27;modernization and scientification&#x27;; it merged into the Israeli Labor Party (part of the Alignment) in 1968. But the labour elite of which Navon was one, would in the future dictate the Left&#x27;s agenda. Navon served as deputy speaker of the Knesset and chairman of the Knesset Committee on Foreign and Defense Affairs.

==President of Israel (1978–83)==
On 19 April 1978, Navon was elected by the Knesset to serve as the fifth President of Israel. The race was uncontested and Navon received 86 votes in the 120-member Knesset with 23 members casting blank votes. He assumed office on 29 May 1978 and was the first president with small children to move into Beit HaNassi, the presidential residence in Jerusalem. His wife, Ofira, was active in promoting the welfare of Israeli children.

As a president, Navon met with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and was influential in the peace talks. According to Haaretz newspaper, he achieved more in one visit than five by Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister.

Although the Israeli presidency is a ceremonial office, Navon was an outspoken advocate of a judicial commission of inquiry to probe Israel&#x27;s role in the Sabra and Shatila massacre perpetrated by Lebanese Falangists in 1982.

==Minister of education==
In 1983, Navon turned down the opportunity to run for a second term of office. Instead he returned to politics, the only Israeli ex-president to do so. When the polls showed that Navon was more popular than Labor chairman Shimon Peres, Peres was pressured to step aside and allow Navon to take over the party leadership. Navon&#x27;s fluency in the Arabic language made him especially popular among Arab and Mizrahi voters. But Navon did not accept the chairmanship. In 1984, he was elected to the Knesset and served as minister of education and culture from 1984 to 1990. Navon was Minister of Education during the first Intifada. During the summer of 1989 there were riots and protests. Jerusalem parents appealed to Navon by petition, to reopen their schools. Navon a socialistic Jew was impressed by the legal implications: &quot;This action is immoral and ineffective and will cause irreversible damage in the long and short run to Palestinian children and to our own.&quot; As the violence escalated moderates suffered at the hands of extremists.

Remaining in the Knesset until 1992, he briefly left politics. Navon emerged from retirement to chair a Commission of Inquiry on Israeli medical authorities&#x27; controversial practice of discarding blood donated by Israelis of Ethiopian origin due to concerns about AIDS transmission.

==Literary career==

Navon wrote two musicals based on Sephardic folklore: &quot;Romancero Sefardi&quot; (1968) and &quot;Bustan Sefardi&quot; (&quot;Sephardic Garden&quot; 1970), which were successfully performed at Habimah, Israel&#x27;s national theater in Tel Aviv.
He is also the author of &quot;The Six Days and the Seven Gates&quot; (1979), a modern legend of the reunification of Jerusalem, first published in Hebrew by Shikmona Publishing Company and later translated into English.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2003, the Spanish government granted Navon an award at Herzliya.

The Jerusalem - Yitzchak Navon Station in central Jerusalem, Israel, is named after Navon and honors his history in the country.
Shortly before his death, he was placed honorary last 120th spot on the Zionist Union list on 2015 Israeli legislative election.

<doc id="762617" wikidata="Q7318434" url="?curid=762617" title="Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition">
<text>The Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSVCE) is an English translation of the Bible first published in 1966 in the United States. In 1965, the Catholic Biblical Association adapted, under the editorship of Bernard Orchard OSB and Reginald C. Fuller, the ecumenical National Council of Churches&#x27; Revised Standard Version (RSV) for Roman Catholic use. It contains the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the Vulgate. The editors&#x27; stated aim for the RSV Catholic Edition was &quot;to make the minimum number of alterations, and to change only what seemed absolutely necessary in the light of Catholic tradition.&quot;

Noted for the formal equivalence of its translation, it is widely used and quoted by Roman Catholic scholars and theologians, and is used for scripture quotations in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The RSV is considered the first ecumenical Bible and brought together the two traditions – the Catholic Douay–Rheims Bible and the Protestant King James Version.

== Background ==
The 1943 encyclical of Pope Pius XII, &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;, encouraged translations of the Catholic Bible from the original languages instead of the Vulgate alone, as had been the tradition since the Council of Trent. &quot;It was in fact with a view to filling this rather obvious gap in the shortest possible time that some Catholic scholars considered the possibility of so editing the Revised Standard Version, on its appearance in 1952, as to make it acceptable to Catholic readers.&quot;
In 1965, the RSV-CE New Testament was published. 

== Considerations for an RSV Catholic Edition ==
A Catholic Bible differs in the number, order, and occasionally preferred emphasis from books typically found in Bibles used by Protestants. The Catholic Church declares: &quot;Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own that very ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament which is called the Septuagint; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the Vulgate.&quot; Not all the books in the Septuagint are included among those that the Catholic Church considers to be part of the Old Testament.

==RSV Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE)==
In early 2006, Ignatius Press released the Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE). The Ignatius Edition &quot;was revised according to [the norms of] &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot;, 2001&quot; and &quot;approved under the same [i.e. 1966] imprimatur by the Secretariat for Doctrine and Pastoral Practices, National Council of Catholic Bishops, February 29, 2000.&quot; To that end, Ignatius Press submitted its proposed revisions to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and to the Congregation for Divine Worship, making specifically-requested changes to those portions of the text in liturgical use as lectionary readings. As with the original RSV and its first Catholic edition, the translation copyright remains in the hands of the National Council of Churches. The RSV-2CE is the basis for Ignatius Press&#x27; &quot;The Ignatius Catholic Study Bible: New Testament&quot;, and is likewise used in Midwest Theological Forum&#x27;s &quot;The Didache Bible&quot;, a study Bible with commentaries based on the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;. The full &quot;Ignatius Catholic Study Bible,&quot; including both the Catholic Old Testament and the New Testament, will be published in Fall 2024. The RSV-2CE is also the translation used in the English-language version &quot;Great Adventure Catholic Bible&quot;, published by Ascension Press. Father Mike Schmitz reads from this translation in his podcast, &quot;The Bible in a Year&quot;. 

The Second Catholic Edition removed archaic pronouns (thee, thou) and accompanying verb forms (didst, speaketh), revised passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot; and elevated some passages out of RSV footnotes when they favored Catholic renderings. For instance, the RSV-2CE renders &quot;almah&quot; as &quot;virgin&quot; in Isaiah 7:14, restores the term &quot;begotten&quot; in John 1:18 and other verses, uses the phrase &quot;full of grace&quot; instead of &quot;favored one&quot; in Luke 1:28, and substitutes &quot;mercy&quot; for &quot;steadfast love&quot; (translated from the Hebrew &quot;hesed&quot;) throughout the Psalms.

=== Liturgical use and endorsements ===
Catholic authors Scott Hahn, Curtis Mitch, and Jimmy Akin use the RSV2CE.

Although the revised lectionary based on the New American Bible is the only English-language lectionary that may be used at Roman Rite Catholic Mass in the United States, the Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition has been approved for liturgical use in Ordinariate Catholic parishes for former Anglicans around the world. To that end, Ignatius Press has published a lectionary based on the RSV-2CE, approved for use by the Episcopal Conference of the Antilles and by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments for use in the personal ordinariates. The Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in the United Kingdom has adopted the RSV-2CE as &quot;the sole lectionary authorized for use&quot; in its liturgies, and the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales agreed in November 2015 to ask approval to use it in a new lectionary for England and Wales.

<text>Gender transition is the process of affirming and expressing one&#x27;s internal sense of gender, rather than the gender assigned to them at birth. It is the recommended course of treatment for individuals struggling with gender dysphoria, providing improved mental health outcomes in the majority of people. 

A social transition may include coming out as transgender, using a new name and pronouns, and changing one&#x27;s public gender expression. This is usually the first step in a gender transition. People socially transition at almost any age, as a social transition does not involve medical procedures. It can, however, be a prerequisite to accessing transgender healthcare in many places. 

In transgender youth, puberty blockers are sometimes offered at the onset of puberty to allow the exploration of their gender identity without the distress of irreversible pubertal changes. Upon reaching the age of consent, they become eligible to pursue a medical transition if it is still desired.

A medical transition may include hormone replacement therapy (HRT), transgender voice therapy, and gender affirming surgeries. The ability to start a medical transition is typically offered after a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a form of medicalization. In recent years, there has been a push for an informed consent model of transgender healthcare which allows adults to access HRT without a formal diagnosis. 

Transitioning is a process that can take anywhere from several months to several years. As a personal journey, there will never be a one-size-fits-all approach to transition.

==Terminology==
This page uses topic-specific vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to the layperson. Below are some definitions to make this page more accessible:

=== Identity-related terms ===

* Assigned gender at birth (AGAB) is a term that refers to the sex or gender assigned to people when they are born. As people are assigned a gender at birth in regards to their physical characteristics, an assigned gender does not account for one&#x27;s internal gender identity. 
* Gender expression refers to the external presentation of one&#x27;s gender identity. Typically, a person&#x27;s gender expression is thought of in terms of masculinity (a tomboy, a butch lesbian, a drag king) or femininity (an effeminate male, a &#x27;femboy&#x27;, a drag queen), but an individual&#x27;s gender expression may incorporate both feminine and masculine traits, or neither. One may express their gender through clothing, behavior, hair styling, voice, etc. It is not necessarily related to one&#x27;s gender identity.
* Gender identity refers to the personal sense of one&#x27;s own gender. It may correlate with the gender assigned at birth, or differ from it. In most individuals, gender identity is congruent with their assigned gender. Those who do not identify with their birth gender may identify as &quot;transgender&quot;.

* Gender dysphoria refers to the distress a person experiences from a mismatch between their internal gender identity and their gender assigned at birth. People who suffer from gender dysphoria may &quot;transition&quot; in order to alleviate this distress.
* Cisgender is an adjective that refers to individuals who identify the gender assigned to them at birth. Cisgender people may have any sexual orientation or gender expression. 
* Transgender is an adjective that refers to individuals who identify with a gender that differs from the one assigned to them at birth. Transgender people may have any sexual orientation or gender expression.

* Non-binary is a term that refers to a gender identity described as neither entirely male nor female (not one of the two binary sexes). Non-binary people may suffer from gender dysphoria, and may consider themselves transgender. Non-binary people may have any sexual orientation or gender expression.
* Transitioning refers to the process of affirming and expressing one&#x27;s internal sense of gender, as opposed to the gender assigned to them at birth. There are two major facets of gender transitioning: a social transition, and a medical transition; almost all transgender people will socially transition, and most will undergo some degree of medical transition. See the opening paragraphs for further information on social and medical transitioning.
* Detransitioning (sometimes also known as re-transitioning) is the cessation of transgender identity and/or a transition to a different gender, often to one&#x27;s natal gender.

=== Medical-related terms ===
It is important to note that most transgender individuals will receive few, if any, surgeries throughout their lifetimes and some may never receive HRT. Barriers to accessing medical transitioning can include: a lack of financing, a lack of desire, or a lack of accessibility. There is no one way to transition, and while a medical transition or surgery can absolutely be medically necessary for some individuals&#x27; personal wellbeing, no two transitions are the same.

* Puberty blockers / hormone blockers are terms that refer to medications used to block natal sex hormones. For transgender youth, hormone blockers may be offered at the onset of puberty to allow the exploration of their gender identity without the distress of irreversible pubertal changes. Puberty blockers are considered reversible and their use is deemed safe and effective as treatment for gender dysphoria in gender-diverse children and precocious puberty in cisgender children; their use may be discontinued at any time if natal puberty-blocking is no longer desired. For transgender adults, hormone blockers may be offered in a course with cross-sex hormone replacement therapy in order to treat gender dysphoria. 
* Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a medical treatment that replaces the primary sex hormones in one&#x27;s body, in order to develop the secondary sex characteristics of the opposite sex. Individuals seeking masculinizing HRT are prescribed the male sex hormone testosterone, while individuals seeking feminizing HRT are prescribed the female sex hormone estrogen.

* Voice therapy (or &#x27;voice training&#x27;) refers to a &quot;non-surgical&quot; gender-affirming treatment for the masculinization or feminization of one&#x27;s voice. &quot;Transfeminine people&quot; will not experience any impact on voice pitch from feminizing hormone therapy (unless their natal puberty was sufficiently blocked), so voice training is very often underwent in order to learn how to speak in a higher and more feminine register. &quot;Transmasculine people&quot;, on the other hand, will experience a marked lowering in pitch from masculinizing HRT (testosterone) to an often cisgender male level, so vocal masculinization training is uncommon outside of those who have not underwent masculinizing HRT. Irrespectively, vocal masculinization training can help one learn to speak in a lower and more masculine register. 
* Voice surgery refers to a &quot;surgical&quot; treatment that allows for the masculinization or feminization of one&#x27;s vocal pitch. &quot;Transfeminine people&quot; can undergo voice surgery to surgically increase their pitch range. Transmasculine people very uncommonly undergo voice surgery, as masculinizing HRT (testosterone) often lowers voices to a cisgender male pitch. Irrespectively, vocal masculinization surgery can be underwent to surgically decrease their pitch range.
* Facial surgery refers to any gender-affirming surgery underwent on the face. There exists facial masculinization and facial feminization.

* Top surgery refers to any gender affirming surgeries performed on the breasts. In transmasculine individuals, this may be a double mastectomy (removal of breast tissue), and/or a &#x27;male chest reconstruction&#x27;. In transfeminine individuals, this may be a breast augmentation.
* Bottom surgery refers to any gender affirming surgeries performed on the genitalia. In transmasculine individuals, this may be a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), and/or a oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries). A penis can be constructed through metoidioplasty or phalloplasty, and a scrotum through scrotoplasty. In transfeminine individuals, this may be a penectomy (removal of the penis), orchiectomy (removal of the testicles), vaginoplasty (construction of a vagina), and/or a vulvoplasty (construction of a vulva).

=== Social-related terms ===

* Going &#x27;full-time&#x27; refers to the act of living everyday life as one&#x27;s identified gender. People who go full-time may or may not pass, and may or may not keep their transgender identity a secret.
* Passing refers to the perception and recognition of trans people as their desired gender identity by outsiders who may not know they are transgender. For many trans people, passing is a very important aspect of their transition often seen as an &#x27;end goal&#x27;. Passing can greatly alleviate gender dysphoria. Failure to pass can cause serious repercussions for trans people&#x27;s psychological well-being and safety, including but not limited to: poor mental health, discrimination, increased barriers to medical care, harassment, fetishization, ostracization, increased risk of homelessness, and targeted violence due to increased visibility of one&#x27;s transgender status.

* Going &#x27;stealth&#x27; refers to the act of living as one&#x27;s identified gender without revealing oneself to be transgender. In some countries, being stealth may be a safety necessity, due to health, safety, and wellbeing risks of being openly transgender.

==Various aspects==
Transitioning is a complicated process that involves any or all of the gendered aspects of a person&#x27;s life, which include aesthetics, social roles, legal status, and biological aspects of the body. People may choose elements based on their own gender identity, body image, personality, finances, and sometimes the attitudes of others. A degree of experimentation is used to know what changes best fit them. Transitioning also varies greatly between cultures and subcultures according to differences in the societies&#x27; views of gender.

===Social aspects===

The social process of transitioning begins with &#x27;coming out&#x27;, where others are told that one does not identify with their birth sex. The newly out trans person may adopt a new name, ask to be referred to with a new set of pronouns, and change their presentation to better reflect their identity. Socially transitioning does not involve medical intervention or gender affirming surgery, but it may be a prerequisite to access transgender healthcare in some regions.

People may socially transition at any age, with documented cases of children as young as 5, or adults as old as 75. While many of those who socially transition will pursue a medical transition, not everyone can access gender affirming care, and not all may wish to pursue it.

=== Psychological aspects ===
A person&#x27;s ideas about gender in general may change as part of their transition, which may affect their religious, philosophical and/or political beliefs. In addition, personal relationships can take on different dynamics after coming out. For instance, what was originally a lesbian couple may become a heterosexual one as a partner comes out as a trans man - or parents of a boy may become parents of a girl after their child comes out as a trans woman.

===Legal aspects===
Transgender people in many parts of the world can legally change their name to something consistent with their gender identity. Some regions also allow one&#x27;s legal sex marker changed on documents such as driver licenses, birth certificates, and passports. The exact requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; some require sex reassignment surgery, while many do not. In addition, some states that require sex reassignment surgery will only accept &#x27;bottom surgery&#x27;, or a genital reconstruction surgery, as a valid form of sex reassignment surgery, while other states allow other forms of gender confirmation surgery to qualify individuals for changing information on their birth certificates. In some U.S. states, it is also possible for transgender individuals to legally change their gender on their drivers license without having had any form of qualifying gender confirmation surgery. Also, some U.S. states are beginning to add the option of legally changing one&#x27;s gender marker to X on legal documents, an option used by some non-binary people.

===Physical aspects===
Physical aspects of gender transition can go along with social aspects; as well as wearing gender affirming clothing, transgender people often hide features from their natal puberty, with many transgender men binding their breasts and transgender women shaving. Other physical aspects of transitioning require medical intervention, such as transgender hormone therapy or surgeries.

=== Grieving gender identity ===
Over the course of a gender transition, people who are close to the transitioning individual may experience a sense of loss and work through a grieving process. This type of loss is an ambiguous loss, characterized by feelings of grief where the item of loss is obscure. Family members may grieve for the gendered expectations that their loved one will no longer follow, whereas the transgender person themself may feel rejected by their relatives&#x27; need to grieve. Feelings that arise are described as a way of seeing the person who is transitioning as the same, but different, or both present and absent.

<doc id="762620" wikidata="Q7571041" url="?curid=762620" title="Southside (Virginia)">
<text>Southside, or Southside Virginia, has traditionally referred to the portion of the state south of the James River, the geographic feature from which the term derives its name. This was the first area to be developed in the colonial period.

During the colonial era, Southside was considered the area where entrepreneurs settled, as opposed to some of the more established and wealthier families in the Tidewater counties. Many early Southside settlers were younger sons of established Tidewater families. A major portion of the territory was formed in 1703, when Prince George County, Virginia was organized from Charles City County. Four other counties and three independent cities were formed from this territory, the counties in the 18th century and some of the independent cities in the 19th and 20th centuries. 

In the 21st century, however, some people use a more limited definition of the region that is confined to the Piedmont area: those counties lying south of the James River, west of the Fall Line, and east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. This is the southern portion of Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont region. This definition describes an area often considered to be the heart of Southside. It also accounts for social and economic changes as the eastern counties developed dense populations, and the Richmond suburbs expanded to occupy large portions of Chesterfield and Powhatan counties.

Southside Virginia is also known as Virginia&#x27;s Black Belt, as it has long had a high concentration of African-Americans relative to other regions of the state. Southside represents the northeastern extremity of the American Black Belt, a heavily African-American region stretching from Virginia to East Texas.

==Counties==

Counties considered part of the region began those divided from Prince George County: Brunswick, Dinwiddie, Nottoway, Amelia, and Prince Edward, formed from parts of Prince George County. In addition to Richmond, the independent city of Petersburg, Virginia was established in this region.

In addition, the western part of Southside has long been reputed for its isolated, rural, and culturally conservative character. Associated counties are Patrick, Henry, Bedford, Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte, Mecklenburg, Campbell, Lunenburg, Appomattox, Buckingham, Cumberland, Powhatan, and Greensville counties. 

The independent cities of Danville, Emporia, and Martinsville are also considered to be in the western part of the region. 

The more rural, western areas of Southside are noted for sharing similarities and connections with North Carolina. For instance, residents of Danville and Martinsville frequently visit the Piedmont Triad for amenities and the Piedmont Triad International Airport. Residents of South Boston and Clarksville, Virginia travel to the Research Triangle for amenities, including use of the Raleigh–Durham International Airport.

==Climate==

Southside Piedmont region has a climate different from the coastal areas of Virginia. Summers are typically hot, with highs generally in the upper 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit or low 30s Celsius; quite often hotter than in Richmond. Winters are moderately cold, and nighttime lows often drop below freezing; frequently cooler than Norfolk. Much of this has to do with the distance of the region from the temperature-moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean.

Snow and frozen precipitation (usually less than ) usually falls every year in Southside, with the western and northern fringes of the area getting several inches more snow than the rest.

==Industries==

Southside, along with much of Upper South, was long known for its tobacco crop. The nutrient-rich soil, along with frequent spring rains, provided ideal growing conditions for tobacco, as well as soybeans and some cold-hardy cotton plants. Tobacco exhausts the soil, however, and in the early 19th century, planters moving into the Piedmont area shifted to mixed crops.

The Fall Line was the area where the first industries were established, with mills running off the water power of rivers, in Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia, for instance. Petersburg was an industrial city with a large proportion of free blacks even before the American Civil War.

Beginning in the 1940s, various textile mills opened up in the Piedmont area of Southside, most notably the enormous Dan River Mills in Danville. Martinsville was also known for its textile mills as well. Companies like Tultex, Pannill Knitting Company, Fieldcrest, and Bassett-Walker. The city as called the &quot; Sweatshirt Capital of the World&quot;. The textile industry, formerly located in New England and the Northeast, shifted to the South because of cheaper labor costs and less union organization. The cost of living in much of Southside is still low compared to most metropolitan areas. The Southside workforce found textile work to be much more lucrative than the low incomes associated with farming by that time. Mechanization required larger farms to be profitable. 

Along with tobacco manufacturing, textile mills added to the prosperity of the Southside region to become more prosperous. Beginning in the 1970s, however, many of the textile mills closed, outsourcing work to other countries where labor costs were cheaper, such as Mexico, India and other nations in Southeast Asia, and China. The waning demand for tobacco products due to health issues affected the Southside economy.

Furniture manufacturing was another major industry, Kenlea Furniture operated for many years in Kenbridge and the Bassett Furniture company continues to operate in the town of Bassett. The Army bases Fort Gregg-Adams and Fort Barfoot employ many people. They were built up to a large extent during World War II. Some residents commute from this area to the Philip Morris factory in south Richmond.

In the 1990s new manufacturing jobs were established in the area, with manufacturing of industrial-grade metals and ceramics. Numerous prisons were established in the area, and employed local people in relatively high-paying security jobs.

==Media==

Television stations are receivable from all parts of Southside, with the eastern parts receiving Richmond stations and the western parts receiving Roanoke/Lynchburg stations. In addition, some viewers on the northern edges of the region receive Charlottesville stations, while viewers on the southern edge receive Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point and Raleigh/Durham stations.

While most people receive large-market radio stations from the same places as their TV stations, Southside has a large variety of local radio. Country stations tend to dominate Southside radio, though local classic rock, adult contemporary, Top 40, and public radio formats exist.

All of Southside can receive Virginia&#x27;s largest newspaper, the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;. Southside is also covered by Cardinal News, a nonprofit newsroom that covers Southwest and Southside Virginia. In addition, all the towns listed below (and others) have local newspapers, and they are generally weekly publications.

<doc id="762622" wikidata="Q1041627" url="?curid=762622" title="Air-to-Air Stinger">
<text>The Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) (also unofficially called AIM-92 Stinger) is an air-to-air missile system developed from the shoulder-launched FIM-92 Stinger, for use on helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache, T129 ATAK, Eurocopter Tiger, and also UAVs such as the MQ-1 Predator. The missile itself is identical to the shoulder-launched Stinger.

==Development==
The US Army has used the ATAS variant on its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in the air-to-air role.

In a 19 November 1996 demonstration, a Stinger (ATAS) Block-1 missile was launched from an OH-58D at the Yuma Proving Ground and successfully destroyed a QUH-1 drone helicopter deploying countermeasures at a range greater than .

All Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block II missiles will be modified existing Stinger RMP missiles (FIM-92C). Block II will incorporate various improvements including a new staring IR focal plane array seeker, a new battery, and advanced signal processing capabilities. The seeker permits engagements of helicopters in clutter out to the maximum physical range of the missile, also improved accuracy and IRCCM capabilities, and will provide a full night capability. The Block II missile also supports seeker slaving (steering the missile&#x27;s seeker off-axis before launch to lock onto targets). This was first demonstrated on 6 November 1997 at Yuma.

ATAL is an upgrade to the Air-to-Air Stinger launcher fielded on the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and Blackhawk helicopters. In mid 2000, tests were carried out with the ATAL system mounted on the AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter. Nine missiles were fired, eight of which scored direct hits against simulated hovering helicopter targets in a clutter environment. The missiles were launched with the Longbow helicopter traveling at speeds from hovering to , side slips up to , partial power descents, pull-up maneuvers, hovering pedal turns, push-over maneuvers, and a 22-degree bank.

==Operational history==
An Iraqi MiG-25 shot down a Predator drone performing reconnaissance over the no fly zone in Iraq on 23 December 2002. Predators had been armed with Stingers, and were being used to &quot;bait&quot; Iraqi fighter planes, then run. In this incident, the Predator, with a top speed of , and a ceiling of , could not run from the MiG-25, which has a top speed of , and a ceiling of , so it fired a Stinger missile. The Stinger failed to hit the MIG, possibly because it could not distinguish between the heat signatures of the MIG and the missile it fired. The missile fired by the MiG destroyed the Predator. This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone had engaged in combat.

==Models==
There are three variants of &quot;Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS)&quot;:

===ATAS===
The original Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) is an adaptation of the early versions man portable Stinger System including FIM-92B and C. It is a light weight missile designed to engage low altitude targets.

===ATAS Block I===
The ATAS Block I is an upgrade to the sensors and software to upgrade the ATAS to FIM-92E standard.

===ATAS Block II===
All Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block II missiles will be modified existing Stinger RMP missiles. The Block II retrofit program will add the Block I modifications plus incorporate a staring IR focal plane array seeker, a new battery, and advanced signal processing capabilities. The new seeker will permit engagements of helicopters in clutter out to the kinematic range of the missile. The missile and launcher will be MIL-STD-1760 compatible. The Block II program will also extend shelf life, improve accuracy and IRCCM capabilities, and will provide a full night capability.

==General characteristics==
&quot;As FIM-92 Stinger&quot;
* Length: 
* Diameter: 
* Wingspan: 
* Launch weight: 
* Guidance: Fire-and-forget passive infrared seeker for Block I and Fire-and-forget passive IR focal plane array seeker in Block II version

<text>Boris Ivanovich Morozov (; 1590 – 1661) was a Russian statesman and boyar who led the Russian government during the early reign of Tsar Alexis. Morozov came from a long noble line, yet was poor before his appointments.

==Life==
In 1634, when Tsarevich Alexis was five years old, Morozov was appointed as his tutor. This began Morozov&#x27;s influence on the Russian court and affairs.

On 17 January 1648, Morozov procured the marriage of the tsar with Maria Miloslavskaya, himself marrying her sister, Anna, ten days later, both daughters of Ilya Danilovich Miloslavsky.

During his long career at the Kremlin court, Morozov supervised a number of government departments (called prikazy) – Grand Treasury, Streltsy, Pharmacy, and Payroll. Aspiring to increase the treasury’s income, Morozov reduced salaries of state employees and introduced a high indirect salt tax. These measures caused the Salt Riot of 1648. The rebels demanded Morozov&#x27;s handover, but the tsar hid him in his palace and then sent him in a fictitious exile into the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. After four months, however, Morozov returned to Moscow.

In 1649, Morozov took an active part in preparing the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, a legal code which would survive well into the 19th century. In the early 1650s, while maintaining a low profile, he was still in charge of the Russian government. He owned 55,000 peasants and a number of mills, distilleries, and factories that produced iron, bricks, and salt. His sister-in-law, Boyarynya Morozova, was involved in the Old Believer movement.

<text>USS &quot;Abilene&quot; (PF-58), a , was in the service of the United States Navy, named after the city of Abilene, Kansas.

==Construction==
She was laid down on 6 May 1943 as &quot;Bridgeport&quot;, Maritime Commission (MARCOM) hull 1465, and originally classified as patrol gunboat, PG-166, on 6 May 1943, at the Globe Shipbuilding Company in Superior, Wisconsin. She was launched on 21 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Rogers; acquired by the Navy on 31 May 1944; renamed &quot;Abilene&quot;, reclassified a patrol frigate, and assigned hull number PF-58 on 28 June 1944; and commissioned on 28 October 1944 with Lieutenant Commander Chester I. Steel, USCG, in command.

==Service history==
Following shakedown at Bermuda, &quot;Abilene&quot; steamed to NS Argentina, Newfoundland, where she joined the North Atlantic Weather Patrol. She operated on this station through May 1945, conducting weather observations and rendering navigational assistance to airplanes.

After a brief period of upkeep at Boston, Massachusetts, &quot;Abilene&quot; assumed air-sea rescue duties in the Atlantic in June 1945. As a member of Task Group 24.5, the patrol vessel collected weather data while serving as a plane guard along the air routes between Europe and the United States.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Abilene&quot; was decommissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 21 August 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 13 November 1946. The ship was sold to the government of the Netherlands on 5 May 1947.

The ship was renamed &quot;Cirrus&quot;, and eventually scrapped in 1969.

<doc id="762637" wikidata="Q7536263" url="?curid=762637" title="Skookumchuck River">
<text>The Skookumchuck River is a long river located in southwest Washington, United States. It is a tributary of the Chehalis River, which is the largest drainage basin located entirely within the state.

==History==
The name &quot;Skookumchuck&quot; derives from Chinook Jargon: in this context, &quot;rapids&quot;. The word &quot;skookum&quot; means &quot;strong&quot;, and &quot;chuck&quot; means &quot;water&quot;. The Quinault Indian Nation, by way of the 1856 Treaty of Olympia, hold fishing rights on the river. Beginning in 2021, the river is allowed to be used as a year-round water bank and is the largest in the state, allowing a draw of 28,000 acre-feet of water per year.

==Course==
The river begins with several tributaries in the Snoqualmie National Forest in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, and flows west past the town of Bucoda, Washington to its confluence with the Chehalis River near Centralia, Washington.

==Skookumchuck Dam==

The Skookumchuck Dam was built in 1970, creating the long Skookumchuck Reservoir. Its primary use is to provide water for the TransAlta coal plant and is not used for local or community water needs. The dam is an earthen bank structure measuring tall and spans .

With low water levels in the reservoir, the system provides some flood protection to communities downstream, such as Bucoda, however, the dam was not built for flood prevention. The earthen dam has been part of several flood mitigation proposals to protect the Centralia and Chehalis communities from continuing overflow events. The embankment contains a trap system in which mature steelhead are caught and transported over the spillway but existing fish passages prevent young salmon from migrating.

The dam and reservoir is overseen by TransAlta and, by contract, will continue in their oversight role after the coal plant is closed at the end of 2025. At that time, water rights will revert to the city of Centralia for public consumption.

===Dam removal===
A 2022 study to remove the dam by the Office of Chehalis Basin (OCB) estimated a cost up to $35 million, with a potential high of $80 million when factors are added for the loss of downstream water rights. The study concluded the best options were improvements to the dam to include fish passages, as well as to use the dam for flood control purposes.

In June 2024, a petition to remove the dam at the termination of the Centralia Steam Generation Plant operations was filed by the Quinault Indian Nation. Requesting the removal by at least the end of 2025, the Quinault expects immediate, natural restoration of the river&#x27;s flow and salmon habitat.

==Ecology and environment==
The Skookumchuck River has lost several key components for a healthy river system due to human activities, such as farming and the dam. , the aquatic habitat and species are considered to be lacking in diversity due to a lack of natural wood deposits and pool areas for fish. This leads to higher predation, leading fish using the river as a pass-through rather than a feed-and-rest area. Additionally, a network of dams, dikes, and removal of natural barriers has disconnected the floodplain, causing more erosion to the habitat as waters rush through the Skookumchuck during high rain and thaw events.

The loss of old-growth trees and lack of native plant species is also a concern. Non-native and invasive plants have caused riparian habitats to struggle as native plants are prevented from being reestablished. The decrease in native trees and shrubs, with deep roots and shade cover ideal for the banks of the river, lead to more erosion and subsequently a lack of food and shelter for aquatic animals.

A project began in mid-2024 to repair human-caused issues of the Skookumchuck system and was authorized by the Chehalis Basin Strategy. Known as the Riverbend Project, the habitat restoration efforts are in partnership or support with various state agencies such as the Chehalis Basin Board, the Office of Chehalis Basin&#x27;s Aquatic Species Restoration Program, the Thurston Conservation District, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Further collaboration includes a mix of groups and professionals working in environmental conservation. The project has helped to protect the river from agricultural and farming impacts with a focus on surface runoff, and has included the removal of invasive plants, the planting of native vegetation, a reconnection of the floodplain by creating higher flow channels, the placement of logjams, and integrating both natural river habitats with that of farms by the practice of silvopasture.

The Riverbend Project is expected to continue possibly up to 2030, focusing on maintenance and monitoring of the system, adapting as needed. The $8 million effort is funded by a large association of partners in both Thurston County and Washington state.

<text>The Hamma Hamma River is a river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It rises near Mount Washington in the Olympic Mountains within the Olympic National Park and drains to Hood Canal and thence to the Pacific Ocean.

The name Hamma Hamma comes from a Twana village once located at the river&#x27;s mouth and called &quot;Hab&#x27;hab&quot;, referring to a reed that grows along the river&#x27;s banks.

<doc id="762650" wikidata="Q5483052" url="?curid=762650" title="Francisco's Fight">
<text>Francisco&#x27;s Fight is the name commonly given to an alleged skirmish between a detachment of the British Legion and Peter Francisco, a Continental Army soldier with a long service record, during the American Revolutionary War in July 1781. Francisco&#x27;s varying descriptions of the skirmish claimed the death of at least one man and the wounding of several others. It wasn&#x27;t recorded by anyone else. Later historical accounts of the skirmish embellished the story with details not present in the documentary record.

==Background==

In early July 1781, General Charles Cornwallis, in command of British troops in Virginia, arrived at Portsmouth and prepared to embark some of the troops on transports. While en route to Portsmouth, he dispatched Banastre Tarleton and some of his British Legion (also known as &quot;Tarleton&#x27;s Legion&quot;) on a raiding expedition into central Virginia. Moving rapidly, Tarleton and his men left Suffolk on July 9, and rode deep into the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The complete expedition ended up being a trek that succeeded in raiding some military stores, although most of the targeted supplies had already been sent off to Nathanael Greene&#x27;s Continental Army in South Carolina; Tarleton returned to Portsmouth on July 24.

Peter Francisco was a private who served in several units during the war. He was a striking figure, reported to be about six feet six inches (about 198 cm) and over , and was known for his strength. In the northern campaigns, he was in the battles at Brandywine and Monmouth Court House, and supposedly was the second man in the fortifications during the Battle of Stony Point. He then served in the southern army under General Greene, where he was reported to have killed 11 men during the May 1781 Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He was also injured in that battle, and had returned to his home in Buckingham, Virginia to recuperate.

==Skirmish==
The only documented primary sources for this action originate with Peter Francisco himself. One is a 1820 letter addressed to the Virginia State Assembly in 1820. The other is Francisco&#x27;s 1829 application to the United States Congress for financial support. His request was rejected on the grounds that he was already receiving a military pension. The two accounts differ in some details, but much of the narrative is essentially the same. No other sources are known to corroborate the events he describes; Tarleton, in his memoir, only generally mentions casualties that occurred during the expedition.
In the 1820 account Francisco describes how, while passing through Amelia County, Virginia (in a part that is now Nottoway County) on his way home, he encountered a detachment of dragoons from the British Legion at Capt. Benjamin Ward&#x27;s Plantation, “West Creek”. One of the dragoons demanded that he give up his watch and silver shoe buckles. He refused. As the dragoon bent down to take his buckles, Francisco, who was unarmed, reached down and drew the man&#x27;s sword from its scabbard. He then used the sword to kill the man. According to the Virginia letter, he then &quot;wounded and drove off the others&quot;, taking eight of the nine horses [the ninth horse was ridden by one of the horseman who had a large cut on his back]. In the 1829 letter to Congress, he claims to have killed two more men and &quot;frightened off the rest of the party, amounting in number to six.&quot;

==Embellished account==
One of the most widely published accounts of Francisco&#x27;s fight was that of Virginia historian Henry Howe, first published by him in 1845, and also appearing in an 1844 compendium of Revolutionary War anecdotes by John Lauris Blake. The version reprinted below (from Howe&#x27;s 1852 edition) contains details not present in Francisco&#x27;s own written accounts, including the presence nearby of Tarleton&#x27;s main body, and an allegation of the tavernkeeper&#x27;s assistance to the raiders. Some of its details are visible in the 1814 engraving depicted above.

While the British army were spreading havoc and desolation all around them, by their plundering and burnings in Virginia, in 1781, Francisco had been reconnoitring, and while stopping at the house of a Mr. V---, then in Amelia, now Nottoway county, nine of Tarleton&#x27;s cavalry came up, with three negroes, and told him he was their prisoner. Seeing he was overpowered by numbers, he made no resistance. Believing him to be very peaceable, they all went into the house, leaving him and the paymaster together. &#x27;Give up instantly all that you possess of value,&#x27; said the latter, &#x27;or prepare to die.&#x27; &#x27;I have nothing to give up,&#x27; said Francisco, &#x27;so use your pleasure.&#x27; &#x27;Deliver instantly,&#x27; rejoined the soldier, &#x27;those massy silver buckles which you wear in your shoes.&#x27; &#x27;They were a present from a valued friend,&#x27; replied Francisco, &#x27;and it would grieve me to part with them. Give them into your hands I never will. You have the power; take them, if you think fit.&#x27; The soldier put his sabre under his arm, and bent down to take them. Francisco, finding so favorable an opportunity to recover his liberty, stepped one pace in his rear, drew the sword with force from under his arm, and instantly gave him a blow across the scull. &#x27;My enemy,&#x27; observed Francisco, &#x27;was brave, and though severely wounded, drew a pistol, and, in the same moment that he pulled the trigger, I cut his hand nearly off. The bullet grazed my side. Ben V---. (the man of the house) very ungenerously brought out a musket, and gave it to one of the British soldiers, and told him to make use of that. He mounted the only horse they could get, and presented it at my breast. It missed fire. I rushed on the muzzle of the gun. A &quot;short struggle ensued&quot;. I disarmed and wounded him. Tarleton&#x27;s troop of &quot;four hundred men&quot; were in sight. All was hurry and confusion, which I increased by repeatedly hallooing, as loud as I could, &quot;Come on, my brave boys; now&#x27;s your time; we will soon dispatch these few, and then attack the main body!&quot; The wounded man flew to the troop; the others were panic struck, and fled. I seized V---, and would have dispatched him, but the poor wretch begged for his life; lie was not only an object of my contempt, but pity. The eight horses that were left behind, I gave him to conceal for me. Discovering Tarleton had dispatched ten more in pursuit of me, I made off. I evaded their vigilance. They stopped to refresh themselves. I, like an old fox, doubled, and fell on their rear. I went the next day to V--- for my horses; he demanded two, for his trouble and generous intentions. Finding my situation dangerous, and surrounded by enemies where I ought to have found friends, I went off with my six horses. I intended to have avenged myself of V--- at a future day, but Providence ordained I should not be his executioner, for he broke his neck by a fall from one of the very horses.&#x27;

==Legacy==
In 1931 the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a marker at the approximate site of the skirmish. It is located in the vicinity of the community of Jennings Ordinary.
There is a state historical marker commemorating the event; according to Mark Boatner&#x27;s &quot;Landmarks of the American Revolution&quot; (1992 ed.), it is located on U.S. Route 360, six miles south of Burkeville and about five miles due west of the site formerly occupied by Ward&#x27;s tavern.

<text>Maurice Benard (born March 1, 1963) is an American actor. He played Nico Kelly in the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1987 to 1990 and in 1991 portrayed Desi Arnaz in the biographical television film &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;. In 1993, Benard began starring as Sonny Corinthos in the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. For his role in &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Benard received three Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

==Early life==
Benard was born Mauricio José Morales in Martinez, California, the son of Martha, a bank employee, and Humberto Morales, a bakery superintendent. He grew up in San Francisco, California, and is of Nicaraguan and Salvadoran ancestry. 

==Career==
In 1980s, he began career as a model before acting. In 1987, Benard made his television debut playing Nico Kelly in the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role he played until 1990. He received Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Outstanding Male Newcomer: Daytime in 1989. He later made guest appearances in prime time shows include &quot;DEA&quot;, &quot;Stat&quot; and &quot;Dark Justice&quot;. In 1991, Benard appeared in a supporting role in the made-for-television movie &quot;Her Wicked Ways&quot; and later that year played Desi Arnaz in the biographical television film &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot; opposite Frances Fisher. The following year he made his big screen debut appearing in the biographical drama film, &quot;Ruby&quot; and later had secondary role in the 1993 independent film &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot;.

In 1993, Benard was cast as Sonny Corinthos, a manic depressive mobster kingpin in the ABC daytime soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot;. His first air date on &quot;GH&quot; was August 13, 1993. Initially, the character was only supposed to last for six months as Benard was not interested in anything more than a year. He revealed that after his stint on &quot;All My Children&quot;, he was not interested in doing another soap. He joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; because he had gone broke and acting was all he knew at the time. The producers offered him two separate roles, that of mobster Damian Smith, with a two-year contract, and that of Sonny. Benard revealed that just two weeks after starting work, he suffered a manic depressive breakdown. At one point he had stopped coming in to work but expressed his gratitude to the network for keeping faith in him instead of firing him immediately. He reprised his role in the 1996 prime time special &quot;General Hospital: Twist of Fate&quot;, daytime spin-off &quot;Port Charles&quot; in 2000, and in an episode of prime time spin-off &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; in 2007.

Benard has been nominated for ten Daytime Emmy Awards for his role of Sonny Corinthos, winning for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2003, 2019, and 2021, as well as winning three Soap Opera Digest Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in 1996, 2003, and 2005.

In addition for his daytime television career, Benard also starred in a number of feature and made-for-television movies. He appeared in the 2015 comedy-drama film &quot;Joy&quot; directed by David O. Russell. He starred in the 2017 independent mystery thriller film &quot;The Ghost and the Whale&quot;, executive produced by his wife Paula. He guest-starred on ABC crime series &quot;Castle&quot; in 2016 and appeared opposite Jamie Luner in the Lifetime thriller &quot;A Lover Betrayed&quot; (2017). In 2018, Benard appeared in the horror anthology film, &quot;Nightmare Cinema&quot; starring in segment directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. In 2019 he played John Gotti in the Lifetime crime film &quot;Victoria Gotti: My Father&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He later starred in films &quot;Hold On&quot; (2019), and &quot;Equal Standard&quot; (2020).

==Personal life==
Benard married Paula Smith on August 11, 1990. They have four children: three daughters and one son. He and his wife adopted his wife&#x27;s younger sister Heather, after their mother&#x27;s death.

His cousin, Marvin Benard, played professional baseball.

Benard was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 22. He has become a spokesperson for treatment of the disorder with Mental Health America. He made the decision to have the &quot;General Hospital&quot; writers make his character, Sonny Corinthos, also have the disorder. Many of the struggles he faces on the show due to the disorder are ones he faced in his own life. Much praise has been given to the show for the realistic depiction.

<doc id="762654" wikidata="Q289371" url="?curid=762654" title="Dosewallips River">
<text>The Dosewallips River ( ) is a river situated on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It rises near Mount Anderson in the Olympic Mountains within Olympic National Park and drains to Hood Canal and thence to the Pacific Ocean.

The river originates in two forks, which join about five miles from the headwaters. The National Park Service maintains trails and campsites along both forks, including one at the fork itself. The road leading to the trailhead was washed out in January 2002, and the ranger station near the trailhead has been abandoned.

The entire estuary of the Dosewallips is within Dosewallips State Park and ongoing restoration efforts led by Wild Fish Conservancy, the Port Gamble S&#x27;Klallam Tribe, and the Hood Canal Coordinating Council are intended to improve salmon habitat through the reconnection of the river to its historical floodplain.

==Name==
The name Dosewallips comes from a Twana Indian myth about a man named Dos-wail-opsh who was turned into a mountain at the river&#x27;s source. There are also several Klallam legends about the &quot;Great Changer&quot;, Doquebatl, who transformed a mythical Klallam chief into a mountain at the headwaters of the Dosewallips River. In another story Doquebatl changed a woman into Mount Rainier and her son into Little Tahoma.

==History==

In 1923, the Washington State Department of Highways built a steel truss bridge over the river near its mouth in Brinnon to carry U.S. Route 101.

In 1982, the Jefferson County Public Utility District proposed the construction of a 10.4-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the river near the Elkhorn Campground. Controversy over the dam project led to a dispute between the PUD and the Washington Department of Ecology that was settled in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Ecology&quot; in 1994.

<doc id="762656" wikidata="Q3321664" url="?curid=762656" title="Mount Anderson (Washington)">
<text>Mount Anderson is a peak in the Olympic Mountains of the Pacific Northwest. Rising in the center of Olympic National Park in Washington state, it is the second highest peak on the Anderson Massif, after West Peak. Anderson Glacier used to be located in a cirque on the mountain&#x27;s southern flank while Eel Glacier is in another cirque, northwest of the summit. Hanging Glacier is on the east side of a ridge which extends north from the peak.

Anderson is at the center of three major watersheds in the Olympic Range. Most of the water which falls on the massif flows into the Dosewallips River which drains, by way of the Hood Canal, into Puget Sound. The drainage from the west side flows down the Quinault River and into the Pacific, while some of the water on the mountain&#x27;s northwest side flows into the Hayes River which finds its way north, to the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Mount Anderson was named by army Lieutenant Joseph O&#x27;Neil for his commanding officer, Thomas M. Anderson. It was first climbed in 1920 by Fairman B. Lee and a party of 13.

==Climate==
Mount Anderson is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

==Geology==

The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

<text>The Croatian Military Frontier ( or &quot;&quot;) was a district of the Military Frontier, a territory in the Habsburg monarchy, first during the period of the Austrian Empire and then during Austria-Hungary.

==History==
Founded in the late 16th century out of lands of the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia, it was initially a nominal part of that Kingdom, to be transferred in 1627 to direct imperial rule as part of the Military Frontier. The Frontier was located on the border with the Ottoman Empire. In the Frontier zone, the king-emperors promised free land and freedom of religion to people who came to the area with the majority of the population being Croats, Serbs and Vlachs. In exchange, the people who lived in the area had an obligation to fight for the Empire, and to protect the land. In 1630 Emperor Ferdinand II enacted the &quot;Statuta Valachorum&quot; laws. It was known that the soldiers had to fulfill military service between the ages of 16 and 66. At the end of the 17th century, Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia expanded its borders so the territory of the Croatian Military Frontier was also expanded to include some former Ottoman territories in the east. In 1783 it was placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command headquartered in Zagreb. The Military Frontier was demilitarized on 8 August 1873. The Croatian Military Frontier existed until 15 July 1881, when it was abolished and incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (like the Slavonian one).

==Geography==

This part of the Military Frontier included the geographic regions of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and bordered the Adriatic Sea to the west, Venetian Republic to the south, Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia to the north-west, the Ottoman Empire to the south-east, Habsburg Kingdom of Slavonia to the east, and Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary to the north.

It extended onto the Slavonian Military Frontier near the confluence of the Una river into the Sava. Like the rest of the Military Frontier, it ceased to exist as a political entity in the late 19th century.

==Sections==

Croatian Military Frontier included three General Command () sections which were divided into eight Regiments:
* Varaždin General Command
** Križevci Regiment N°V
** Đurđevac Regiment N°VI
* Karlovac General Command
** Lika Regiment N°I
** Otočac Regiment N°II
** Ogulin Regiment N°III
** Slunj Regiment N°IV
* Zagreb General Command
** Glina Regiment N°X
** Petrinja Regiment N°XI

==Demographics==
In 1802, the estimated population consisted of:
* 195,300 Roman Catholics
* 180,800 Orthodox Christians

In 1820, estimated population of Croatian Military Frontier included:
* 207,747 Catholics
* 198,728 Orthodox Christians

According to Hungarian statistician Elek Fényes, in 1840 the Croatian Military Frontier was populated by 498,947 people and the ethnic structure was:
* 258,454 Croats
* 240,493 Serbs

The first modern census from 1857 recorded the religion of the populace of Croatian Military Frontier:
* 285,344 Roman Catholics
* 253,429 Orthodox Christians
* 5,433 Eastern Catholics

74.8% of the active population in Croatian-Slavonian Military Frontier were employed in agriculture, 18.63% were inactive soldiers, while 3.11% were working in industry.

<text>Mount Washington is a peak in the Olympic Mountains of Washington state. The mountain is located in the Mount Skokomish Wilderness.

==Climate==
Mount Washington is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Hamma Hamma River and Skokomish River.

<text>The first USS &quot;Ability&quot; (PYc-28) was a yacht in the service of the United States Navy used for anti-submarine warfare during World War II.

==Service history==
She was built as &quot;Reomar IV&quot; in 1926 at Bay City, Michigan by Defoe Boat and Motor Works, and purchased by the Navy on 12 March 1942. She was renamed &quot;Ability&quot; and assigned hull number PYc-28. Commissioned on 28 September 1942.

After a brief period of shakedown training, &quot;Ability&quot; reported in November 1942 to Commander, Eastern Sea Frontier, and through the late autumn and winter performed patrol duty. Between March 1943 and September 1944, &quot;Ability&quot; was attached to the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida. There, she participated in antisubmarine warfare training exercises and carried out harbor guard duties.

The ship was decommissioned on 29 September 1944, and placed in an &quot;in service&quot; status for duty as a naval reserve training ship at Tompkinsville, New York. &quot;Ability&quot; was placed out of service on 19 September 1945, and was struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1945. She was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 18 May 1946.

<text>The Big Quilcene River is a river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Quilcene&quot; comes from the Twana word /qʷəʔlsíd/, referring to a tribal group and the name of an aboriginal Twana village and community on Quilcene Bay.

==Course==
The Big Quilcene River rises in the Buckhorn Wilderness near Marmot Pass, south of Buckhorn Mountain, and near Boulder Ridge. It flows generally east through the Olympic Mountains and the Olympic National Forest. After flowing south briefly the river is joined by Tunnel Creek and again flows east. It cuts through the Quilcene Range of the Olympic Mountains in which it collects a number of tributaries, including Mile And A Half Creek. Near Rainbow Campground the river turns north and is paralleled by U.S. Route 101. In its last few miles the river turns east and flows by the south side of Quilcene before emptying into Quilcene Bay, part of Hood Canal.

The Little Quilcene River enters Quilcene Bay less than a mile to the north.

<doc id="762676" wikidata="Q1897597" url="?curid=762676" title="Hugh Faringdon">
<text>Hugh Faringdon, (died 14 November 1539), earlier known as Hugh Cook, later as Hugh Cook alias Faringdon and Hugh Cook of Faringdon, was an English Benedictine monk who presided as the last Abbot of Reading Abbey in the town of Reading in Berkshire, England. At the dissolution of the monasteries under King Henry VIII of England, Faringdon was accused of high treason and executed. He was declared a martyr and beatified by the Catholic Church in 1895.

==Life==
Born Hugh Cook, he adopted the surname of Faringdon when he became a monk, sometime prior to 1500. The use of this surname suggests that he came from Faringdon, a town some northwest of Reading. However it is also significant that he subsequently used the arms of the Cook family of Kent, suggesting that he had connections there. He is believed to have been educated within the abbey, and later served as the sub-cellarer of the abbey.

Hugh Faringdon was elected Abbot of Reading Abbey in 1520, upon the death of Abbot Thomas Worcester. As well as his spiritual duties, he also took up the civil duties expected at that time of a mitred abbot, being appointed as Justice of the Peace and to various governmental Commissions for Berkshire from 1526 to 1538.

At first Faringdon&#x27;s relationship with King Henry VIII of England seemed to have been supportive. King Henry was his guest on 30 January 1521, and he later became one of the royal chaplains. Among Henry&#x27;s New Year gifts in 1532 was £20 in a white leather purse to the Abbot of Reading. When the king was hunting in the neighborhood, the abbot would take the opportunity of sending him presents of Kennet trout or hunting knives.

Faringdon seems to have taken the king&#x27;s side during the divorce controversy. While Henry was searching for authorities to support his views on matrimonial laws, Faringdon sent him books which he thought would serve the purpose. He sat in Parliament from 1523 to 1539 and, in 1530, he signed, with other members of the House of Lords, a letter to the Pope pointing out the evils likely to result from delaying the divorce desired by the King; and, again in 1536, he signed the Articles of Faith drawn up in Convocation which virtually acknowledged the supremacy of the Crown over the Church. On Sunday, 4 November 1537, he sang the requiem and dirge for Queen Jane Seymour at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, and was present at the burial on 12 November. As late as March 1538, he was in favour, being placed in the commission of the peace for Berkshire.

When the commissioners arrived to take the surrender of Reading Abbey, they reported favourably of the abbot&#x27;s willingness to conform, but the surrender of the abbey does not survive, and it is not therefore known whether or not Faringdon actually signed it.

In 1539, Faringdon was indicted for high treason after being accused of having assisted the Northern rebels with money. He was tracked down at Bere Court, his manor at Pangbourne, and taken back to the Tower of London, where he spent two months. As a mitred abbot he was entitled to be tried by Parliament, but no scruples troubled the chancellor, Thomas Cromwell. His death sentence was therefore passed before his trial began. Along with John Rugg, a known associate, and John Eynon, the priest of St Giles&#x27; Church in Reading, he was found guilty and hanged, drawn and quartered before the inner Abbey gatehouse on 14 November 1539.

John Rugg had been charged with taking and concealing one of the Abbey&#x27;s celebrated relics, being the purported hand of St. Anastasius. The monks of Reading, not under suspicion of complicity in the Abbot&#x27;s alleged treason, were given pensions normally set upon monks and nuns at the dissolution of their monasteries.

==Legacy==
Hugh Faringdon was declared a martyr of the Catholic Church and beatified by the Pope Leo XIII in 1895 and his feast day is 15 November.

There are stained glass windows of Blessed Hugh in the following churches: 

* St James&#x27; Church, the Roman Catholic parish church that occupies part of the footprint of the now ruined Reading Abbey. His two martyred companions are also commemorated.
* Saint Meinrad Archabbey, in Saint Meinrad, Indiana, along with beatified companions Whiting and Beche
* Belmont Abbey outside Hereford

A plaque at the English Martyrs Church in Liebenrood Road, Reading commemorates him.

There is a panel painting of him in the Our Lady and Saint Anne Church in Caversham, Reading.

He is also depicted on &quot;The Martyrdom of Hugh Faringdon, last Abbot of Reading&quot;, painted by Harry Morley in 1917, and now in the collection of the Museum of Reading. 

The Blessed Hugh Faringdon Catholic School, a specialist performing arts college in Reading, is named after him, as also the Blessed Hugh Catholic Church in Faringdon.

<doc id="762678" wikidata="Q7734618" url="?curid=762678" title="The Flying Saucers Are Real">
<text>The Flying Saucers Are Real, by Donald Keyhoe, is a book that investigated reports of UFOs by United States Air Force fighters, personnel, and other aircraft, between 1947 and 1950.

==Synopsis==
It was printed in paperback by Gold Medal Books, in 1950, and sold for $0.25. In December 1949, prior to the publishing of the book, Keyhoe published an article by the same name in &quot;True&quot; magazine, with similar material. The book was a huge success and popularized many ideas in ufology that are still widely believed today. According to Edward J. Ruppelt, the article was &quot;one of the most widely read and widely discussed magazine articles in history&quot;.

&quot;The Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; is short — only 175 pages. Keyhoe contended that the Air Force was investigating these cases, with a policy of concealing their existence from the public until 1949. He stated that this policy was then replaced by one of cautious, progressive revelation.

Keyhoe further stated that Earth had been visited by extraterrestrials for two centuries, with the frequency of these visits increasing sharply after the first atomic weapon test in 1945. Citing anecdotal evidence, he intimated the Air Force may have attained and adapted some aspect of the alien technology, its method of propulsion and perhaps its source of power. He believed the Air Force or the United States federal government would eventually reveal these technologies to the public when the Soviet Union was no longer a threat.

==Reception==
&quot;Keyhoe&#x27;s book &quot;Flying Saucers Are Real&quot; ... was the first influential attempt to promote the idea of &quot;flying saucers&quot; as alien spacecraft.&quot; A loose parody of Keyhoe&#x27;s book and of reports of UFO sightings and alien abductions is &quot;The Flying Saucers Are Very Very Real&quot; (2016).

<doc id="762680" wikidata="Q116229" url="?curid=762680" title="Mount Constance">
<text>Mount Constance is a peak in the Olympic Mountains of Washington and the third highest in the range. It is the most visually prominent peak on Seattle&#x27;s western skyline. Despite being almost as tall as the ice-clad Mount Olympus to the west, Mount Constance has little in the way of glaciers and permanent snow because the eastern, and particularly this northeastern, portion of the Olympics receives far less precipitation. However the narrow and steep Crystal Glacier still exists on the mountain&#x27;s north face, shaded by the bulk of the main peak and with a small lake at its terminus. In addition, the treeline is higher here than mountains to the west, also hinting at the drier alpine conditions.

By virtue of its position at the eastern edge of the Olympics, Mount Constance also enjoys spectacular vertical relief. For example, it rises over above the Dosewallips River to the south in only . It is also only from the tidewater of Hood Canal. The summit of Mount Constance lies on the boundary between Olympic National Park and Buckhorn Wilderness. The Constance massif includes Mount Constance, Inner Constance, the twin peaks of Warrior to the north, as well as numerous subsidiary summits on rocky southern ridges enclosing the cirque basin that contains Lake Constance.

== History ==

In 1853, surveyor George Davidson named three mountains in the Olympics. He named Mount Ellinor for Ellinor Fauntleroy, who later became his wife, Mount Constance for Ellinor&#x27;s older sister and The Brothers for her two brothers.

A U.S. Army bomber plane from McChord Field crashed below the peak of Mount Constance in September 1941, killing all six aboard.
21 March 1975: an air traffic controller confused aircraft call signs and cleared a McChord AFB based C-141A, 64–0641, of the 62d Military Airlift Wing, to descend below safe minimums and it impacted Mount Constance in the Olympic National Forest, Washington, killing 16 passengers and crew

==Climate==

Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Constance is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

==Geology==

The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

== Climbing ==

Routes on the mountain are from Class 3 to mid-Class 5, with ratings from Grade 2 to Grade 4. 
Mount Constance was first climbed in 1922 by R. Schellin and A.E. Smith from the southeast.

=== Access ===

Boulder Ridge (including the Gargoyles, Charlia Lakes, Cloudy Peak, Alphabet Ridge, and Warrior) and Home Lake / Constance Pass are readily accessed via the Buckhorn Wilderness Area (U.S. Forest Service) side of the Upper Dungeness River Trail and Marmot Pass. An alternative approach to the Mount Constance massif—including Inner Constance and the twin peaks of Warrior—is via the Dosewallips River Trailhead off of US 101 and Hood Canal. A third alternative is to access the Constance massif via Quilcene logging roads (FS 2700 aka &quot;Penny Creek Road&quot; off U.S. 101) leading to a brief ascent to Tunnel Creek Ridge and the high alpine shores of Harrison Lake. Views of the east side of Mount Constance and Warrior are available from these roads (the lower portions of which are paved) which actually connect to FS 2800 and the Dungeness / Sequim area via the 5000-foot Bon Jon Pass.

<text>The New Orleans metropolitan area, designated the New Orleans–Metairie metropolitan statistical area by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, or simply Greater New Orleans (, ), is a metropolitan statistical area designated by the United States Census Bureau encompassing seven Louisiana parishes—the equivalent of counties in other U.S. states—centered on the city of New Orleans. The population of Greater New Orleans was 1,271,845 in 2020, up from 1,189,166 at the 2010 United States census. Greater New Orleans is the most populous metropolitan area in Louisiana, and the 45th most populous in the United States. According to 2017 census estimates, the broader New Orleans–Metairie–Slidell combined statistical area (CSA) had a population of 1,510,562.

The New Orleans metropolitan area was devastated by Hurricane Katrina—once a category 5 hurricane, but a category 3 storm at landfall—on August 29, 2005. Within the city of New Orleans proper, multiple breaches and structural failures occurred in the system of levees and flood walls designed under federal government auspices. The city of New Orleans experienced a steep population decline after the hurricane, though by the 2020 census, it had regained a good portion of that loss.

The post-August 2005 decline in the city&#x27;s population negatively impacted population numbers for the entire metropolitan area, which had a population of 1,337,726 million as recorded in the 2000 United States census. Most of the decline in population was accounted for by the decline experienced in the city of New Orleans proper (coterminous with Orleans Parish); the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the city&#x27;s population dropped from 453,728 prior to the storm (July 1, 2005) to 389,476, the estimate for 2020.

Greater New Orleans is the largest regional economy in Louisiana and borders the second largest economically-important area, Greater Baton Rouge. One Fortune 500 company is headquartered in the region, Entergy. The largest companies operating in the New Orleans metropolitan area are Globalstar, AT&amp;T, GE Capital, and the Port of New Orleans. Home to some of Louisiana&#x27;s most-visited tourist destinations, tourists have spent over $10.05 billion in 2019.

== Geography ==
For U.S. census purposes, the New Orleans–Metairie metropolitan statistical area includes seven parishes: Jefferson, Orleans (coterminous with the city of New Orleans), Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, and St. John the Baptist.

St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington parishes all lie across Lake Ponchartrain from New Orleans, and are oftentimes included as part of the region.

According to the New Orleans region&#x27;s chamber of commerce, GNO, Inc. (formerly Metrovision), the region boasts a civilian labor force of over 650,000 and there are over 65,000 students enrolled in the region&#x27;s nine universities and eight community/technical colleges.

The Louisiana State Legislature created a commission (the Regional Planning Commission) to be responsible for the planning and development of the New Orleans metropolitan area. The eight parishes covered by the commission are: Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany and Tangipahoa.

Each parish within the New Orleans metropolitan area and New Orleans–Metairie–Slidell combined statistical areas lie on a very low sea level elevation, though further inland near the Mississippi border its area above sea level increases to 371 feet.

==Demographics==

The New Orleans metropolitan area was first defined in 1950. Then known as the New Orleans standard metropolitan area (New Orleans SMA), it consisted of three parishes—Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard—and had a population of 685,405. Following a term change by the Bureau of the Budget (present-day U.S. Office of Management and Budget), the New Orleans SMA was called the New Orleans standard metropolitan statistical area (New Orleans SMSA). By the census of 1960, the population had grown to 868,480, a 27% increase over the previous census.

St. Tammany Parish was added to the New Orleans SMSA in 1963. The four-parish area had a combined population of 899,123 in 1960 and 1,045,809 in 1970. By the 1980 census, the population had increased by 14% to 1,187,073.

In 1983, the official name was changed to the New Orleans metropolitan statistical area (New Orleans MSA). Two more parishes, St. Charles and St. John the Baptist, were added to the metropolitan area the same year, making a six-parish MSA. The newly defined area had a total of 1,256,256 residents in 1980, but that number had declined to 1,238,816 in 1990.

The New Orleans MSA expanded to eight parishes in 1993 with the inclusion of Plaquemines and St. James. The eight-parish area had a combined population of 1,285,270 at the 1990 census and 1,337,726 in 2000.

The MSA was renamed the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area in 2003, and St. James Parish was removed. At the 2010 U.S. census, the metropolitan statistical area&#x27;s population grew to 1,189,166. The overall racial composition of the New Orleans metropolitan area was as follows: White 58.2% (non-Hispanic white 52.4%), Black or African American 32.5%, American Indian 0.8%, Asian 3.5%, some other race 2.8%, two or more races 2.0%, and Hispanic or Latino (of any race) 8.6%. For those under 18, the majority are minority, with only 45.2% being non-Hispanic whites.

In 2013, St. James was once again included in the MSA, which at the same time was renamed to &quot;New Orleans–Metairie&quot;. The 2019 U.S. census estimates determined the New Orleans metropolitan area&#x27;s population stood at 1,270,530. In 2020, its population increased to 1,271,845. Of the metropolitan population, 485,267 households made up the area with an average of 2.6 persons per household. An estimated 50% of households were married couples, 7% had a male householder with no female present, 23% female with no male householder present, and 19% non-family households. Roughly 43% of the metropolitan population was married and 57% were unmarried. The Greater New Orleans unmarried population included 40% males and 36% females never married.

In 2019, there were 561,747 housing units and 63% were owner-occupied. Nearly 70% of the households were single unit households, 28% were multi-units and approximately 3% were mobile homes. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $211,900, about 25% higher than the amount in Louisiana at the time ($172,100). At the 2019 estimates 47% of housing units were from under $100,000 to $100,000 to $200,000. The New Orleans metropolitan area gained 12.5% of move-ins since 2018.

As of 2020, Greater New Orleans had a racial makeup of 51% White Americans, 35% Blacks or African Americans, 3% Asians, 2% from two or more races, and 9% Hispanic or Latinos of any race. The area&#x27;s median age was 39 and the population made up 52% females and 48% males. Almost 8% of the population were foreign-born with the majority of origins from Latin America and Asia. The predominant language spoken among the racial and ethnic makeup is English only, followed by Spanish. Greater New Orleans residents had an estimated per capita income of $31,889 and median household income of $55,710. Roughly 16.4% of the metropolis lived at or below the poverty line.

In 2023, St. Tammany was split off into its own metropolitan area, leaving the New Orleans MSA with seven parishes and tabulating an adjusted 2020 census population of 1,007,275.

==Combined statistical area==
The New Orleans–Metairie–Slidell combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of nine Louisiana parishes and one Mississippi county. The CSA includes two metropolitan areas and two micropolitan areas.

===Components===
* Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
** New Orleans–Metairie MSA: (Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist parishes).
** Slidell–Mandeville–Covington MSA: (St. Tammany Parish)
* Micropolitan statistical areas (μSAs)
** Bogalusa (Washington Parish)
** Picayune (Pearl River County, Mississippi)

=== Demographics ===
At the 2019 American Community Survey, the combined statistical area had a population of 1,507,017. In 2022 following a redrawing of the former New Orleans–Metairie–Hammond combined statistical area, and the addition of a Slidell metropolitan area, it had a census-estimated population of 1,485,510.

<text>The second USS &quot;Ability&quot; (MSO-519) was an in the service of the United States Navy.

She was laid down on 5 March 1956 at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin by Peterson Builders, launched on 29 December 1956, sponsored by Mrs. Henry P. Williams, and commissioned on 4 August 1958 with Lt. Comdr. W. L. Hough in command.

==Service history==
===Charleston, 1958–1965===
Following outfitting, the minesweeper put to sea on 28 August – bound for Charleston, S.C. — and, on the 29th, reported for duty with Mine Squadron (MinRon) 4. She remained at Charleston until embarking upon her shakedown cruise on 17 September. The ship conducted that training out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and returned to Charleston on 20 October. She served with Mine Division (MinDiv) 45, operating out of Charleston through the end of 1958 and the first six months of 1959. On 1 July 1959, she was transferred to MinDiv 85 as its flagship. &quot;Ability&quot; continued to operate out of Charleston, primarily in support of the Naval Mine Warfare School. She also occasionally provided support services to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Test Facility located at Port Everglades, Florida, and to the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory at Panama City, Florida. When not engaged in those duties, she conducted independent ship&#x27;s exercises and type training along the east coast and in the West Indies.

The year 1960 began normally for &quot;Ability&quot; with operations out of Charleston in support of the Naval Mine Warfare School and the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory. That autumn, however, she added a new dimension to her operations which would remain a facet of her service for the remainder of her career. Late in September, the minesweeper stood out of Charleston bound for the Mediterranean Sea and her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. On 5 October, she reported for duty with the Commander, 6th Fleet, at Rota, Spain. &quot;Ability&quot; spent the next four months conducting minesweeping exercises, supporting amphibious landing exercises, and visiting various Mediterranean ports. On 12 February 1961, she completed turnover ceremonies at Rota, shaped a course for Charleston, and arrived back in her home port on 1 March 1961.

&quot;Ability&quot; served as a close recovery vessel in May 1961 during the &quot;Freedom 7&quot; space shot. For the last two months of 1962, she supported the quarantine of Cuba brought about by the siting of offensive Soviet missiles on that island. She began that duty patrolling the Windward Passage but concluded it as a harbor defense ship for the American base at Guantánamo Bay.
For the remainder of 1964 and all of 1965, she conducted operations out of Charleston in support of the Naval Mine Defense Laboratory and made voyages along the east coast and to the West Indies to participate in various exercises and to engage in refresher training. Her highlight of 1965 came in December when she provided support services for the &quot;Gemini 6&quot; and &quot;Gemini 7&quot; space shots.

===Mediterranean, 1966–1970===
Early in 1966, &quot;Ability&quot; embarked upon another assignment with the 6th Fleet. In February, soon after her arrival in the Mediterranean, she participated in the search for an American nuclear device lost when two Air Force planes, a B-52 bomber and a KC-135 cargo plane, collided in midair. Otherwise, the deployment consisted of the usual exercises and port visits. &quot;Ability&quot; returned to Charleston on 13 July 1966 and resumed services to the Mine Defense Laboratory and the Mine Warfare School. That employment lasted until 11 May 1967, when she shaped a course for Montreal, Canada, to make a goodwill visit to the world&#x27;s fair at that city, Expo &#x27;67. After also visiting Quebec, the minesweeper resumed her normal duties at Charleston on 9 June 1967.

In early 1968 the Ability deployed to the Caribbean in support of the Amphibious Ready Squadron. She returned to Charleston in May 1968.

On 25 July 1968, &quot;Ability&quot; embarked upon her final Mediterranean cruise. The assignment lasted until late November and consisted of normal 6th Fleet operations – exercises, port visits, and Soviet ship surveillance missions. On 30 November, she departed Gibraltar bound for the United States. The minesweeper reentered Charleston harbor on 15 December and began a holiday leave and upkeep period. During 1969 and the first five months of 1970, &quot;Ability&quot; busied herself with normal east coast and West Indies operations.

===Decommissioning and sale===
In June 1970, she was placed out of commission to undergo extensive repairs and modifications at Todd Pacific Shipyards Corp. in Brooklyn, New York. The contract for her rehabilitation, however, was terminated on 16 October 1970 as a result of Department of the Navy force level decisions. Determined to be excess to the needs of the Navy, &quot;Ability&quot; was struck from the Navy List on 1 February 1971. She was subsequently sold for scrapping.

<doc id="762691" wikidata="Q682585" url="?curid=762691" title="Supercritical fluid">
<text>A supercritical fluid (SCF) is a substance at a temperature and pressure above its critical point, where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist, but below the pressure required to compress it into a solid. It can effuse through porous solids like a gas, overcoming the mass transfer limitations that slow liquid transport through such materials. SCFs are superior to gases in their ability to dissolve materials like liquids or solids. Near the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in large changes in density, allowing many properties of a supercritical fluid to be &quot;fine-tuned&quot;.

Supercritical fluids occur in the atmospheres of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, the terrestrial planet Venus, and probably in those of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Supercritical water is found on Earth, such as the water issuing from black smokers, a type of hydrothermal vent. SCFs are used as a substitute for organic solvents in a range of industrial and laboratory processes, most commonly carbon dioxide for decaffeination and water for steam boilers for power generation. Some substances are soluble in the supercritical state of a solvent (e.g. carbon dioxide) but insoluble in the gaseous or liquid state—or vice versa. This can be used to extract a substance and transport it elsewhere in solution before depositing it in the desired place by allowing or inducing a phase transition in the solvent.

==Properties==
Supercritical fluids generally have properties between those of a gas and a liquid. In Table 1, the critical properties are shown for some substances that are commonly used as supercritical fluids.

Table 2 shows density, diffusivity and viscosity for typical liquids, gases and supercritical fluids.

Also, there is no surface tension in a supercritical fluid, as there is no liquid/gas phase boundary. By changing the pressure and temperature of the fluid, the properties can be &quot;tuned&quot; to be more liquid-like or more gas-like. One of the most important properties is the solubility of material in the fluid. Solubility in a supercritical fluid tends to increase with density of the fluid (at constant temperature). Since density increases with pressure, solubility tends to increase with pressure. The relationship with temperature is a little more complicated. At constant density, solubility will increase with temperature. However, close to the critical point, the density can drop sharply with a slight increase in temperature. Therefore, close to the critical temperature, solubility often drops with increasing temperature, then rises again.

===Mixtures===
Typically, supercritical fluids are completely miscible with each other, so that a binary mixture forms a single gaseous phase if the critical point of the mixture is exceeded. However, exceptions are known in systems where one component is much more volatile than the other, which in some cases form two immiscible gas phases at high pressure and temperatures above the component critical points. This behavior has been found for example in the systems N2-NH3, NH3-CH4, SO2-N2 and n-butane-H2O.

The critical point of a binary mixture can be estimated as the arithmetic mean of the critical temperatures and pressures of the two components,

where &quot;χ&quot;&quot;i&quot; denotes the mole fraction of component &quot;i&quot;.

For greater accuracy, the critical point can be calculated using equations of state, such as the Peng–Robinson, or group-contribution methods. Other properties, such as density, can also be calculated using equations of state.

==Phase diagram==
Figures 1 and 2 show two-dimensional projections of a phase diagram. In the pressure-temperature phase diagram (Fig. 1) the boiling curve separates the gas and liquid region and ends in the critical point, where the liquid and gas phases disappear to become a single supercritical phase.

The appearance of a single phase can also be observed in the density-pressure phase diagram for carbon dioxide (Fig. 2). At well below the critical temperature, e.g., 280 K, as the pressure increases, the gas compresses and eventually (at just over 40 bar) condenses into a much denser liquid, resulting in the discontinuity in the line (vertical dotted line). The system consists of 2 phases in equilibrium, a dense liquid and a low density gas. As the critical temperature is approached (300 K), the density of the gas at equilibrium becomes higher, and that of the liquid lower. At the critical point, (304.1 K and 7.38 MPa (73.8 bar)), there is no difference in density, and the 2 phases become one fluid phase. Thus, above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure. At slightly above the critical temperature (310 K), in the vicinity of the critical pressure, the line is almost vertical. A small increase in pressure causes a large increase in the density of the supercritical phase. Many other physical properties also show large gradients with pressure near the critical point, e.g. viscosity, the relative permittivity and the solvent strength, which are all closely related to the density. At higher temperatures, the fluid starts to behave more like an ideal gas, with a more linear density/pressure relationship, as can be seen in Figure 2. For carbon dioxide at 400 K, the density increases almost linearly with pressure.

Many pressurized gases are actually supercritical fluids. For example, nitrogen has a critical point of 126.2 K (−147 °C) and 3.4 MPa (34 bar). Therefore, nitrogen (or compressed air) in a gas cylinder above this pressure is actually a supercritical fluid. These are more often known as permanent gases. At room temperature, they are well above their critical temperature, and therefore behave as a nearly ideal gas, similar to CO2 at 400 K above. However, they cannot be liquified by mechanical pressure unless cooled below their critical temperature, requiring gravitational pressure such as within gas giants to produce a liquid or solid at high temperatures. Above the critical temperature, elevated pressures can increase the density enough that the SCF exhibits liquid-like density and behaviour. At very high pressures, an SCF can be compressed into a solid because the melting curve extends to the right of the critical point in the P/T phase diagram. While the pressure required to compress supercritical CO2 into a solid can be, depending on the temperature, as low as 570 MPa, that required to solidify supercritical water is 14,000 MPa.

The Fisher–Widom line, the Widom line, or the Frenkel line are thermodynamic concepts that allow to distinguish liquid-like and gas-like states within the supercritical fluid.

==History==
In 1822, Baron Charles Cagniard de la Tour discovered the critical point of a substance in his famous cannon barrel experiments. Listening to discontinuities in the sound of a rolling flint ball in a sealed cannon filled with fluids at various temperatures, he observed the critical temperature. Above this temperature, the densities of the liquid and gas phases become equal and the distinction between them disappears, resulting in a single supercritical fluid phase.

In recent years, a significant effort has been devoted to investigation of various properties of supercritical fluids. Supercritical fluids have found application in a variety of fields, ranging from the extraction of floral fragrance from flowers to applications in food science such as creating decaffeinated coffee, functional food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, polymers, powders, bio- and functional materials, nano-systems, natural products, biotechnology, fossil and bio-fuels, microelectronics, energy and environment. Much of the excitement and interest of the past decade is due to the enormous progress made in increasing the power of relevant experimental tools. The development of new experimental methods and improvement of existing ones continues to play an important role in this field, with recent research focusing on dynamic properties of fluids.

==Natural occurrence==

===Hydrothermal circulation===
Hydrothermal circulation occurs within the Earth&#x27;s crust wherever fluid becomes heated and begins to convect. These fluids are thought to reach supercritical conditions under a number of different settings, such as in the formation of porphyry copper deposits or high temperature circulation of seawater in the sea floor. At mid-ocean ridges, this circulation is most evident by the appearance of hydrothermal vents known as &quot;black smokers&quot;. These are large (metres high) chimneys of sulfide and sulfate minerals which vent fluids up to 400 °C. The fluids appear like great black billowing clouds of smoke due to the precipitation of dissolved metals in the fluid. It is likely that at that depth many of these vent sites reach supercritical conditions, but most cool sufficiently by the time they reach the sea floor to be subcritical. One particular vent site, Turtle Pits, has displayed a brief period of supercriticality at the vent site. A further site, Beebe, in the Cayman Trough, is thought to display sustained supercriticality at the vent orifice.

===Planetary atmospheres===
The atmosphere of Venus is 96.5% carbon dioxide and 3.5% nitrogen. The surface pressure is and the surface temperature is , above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid.

The interior atmospheres of the Solar System&#x27;s four giant planets are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium at temperatures well above their critical points. The gaseous outer atmospheres of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into the dense liquid interior, while the nature of the transition zones of the ice giants Neptune and Uranus is unknown. Theoretical models of extrasolar planet Gliese 876 d have posited an ocean of pressurized, supercritical fluid water with a sheet of solid high pressure water ice at the bottom.

==Applications==

===Supercritical fluid extraction===

The advantages of supercritical fluid extraction (compared with liquid extraction) are that it is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. Alternative solvents to supercritical fluids may be poisonous, flammable or an environmental hazard to a much larger extent than water or carbon dioxide are. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling the density of the medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the supercritical fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of green coffee beans, the extraction of hops for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of supercritical fluid extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.

===Supercritical fluid decomposition===
Supercritical water can be used to decompose biomass via Supercritical Water Gasification of biomass. This type of biomass gasification can be used to produce hydrocarbon fuels for use in an efficient combustion device or to produce hydrogen for use in a fuel cell. In the latter case, hydrogen yield can be much higher than the hydrogen content of the biomass due to steam reforming where water is a hydrogen-providing participant in the overall reaction.

===Dry-cleaning===
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCD) can be used instead of PERC (perchloroethylene) or other undesirable solvents for dry-cleaning. Supercritical carbon dioxide sometimes intercalates into buttons, and, when the SCD is depressurized, the buttons pop, or break apart. Detergents that are soluble in carbon dioxide improve the solvating power of the solvent. CO2-based dry cleaning equipment uses liquid CO2, not supercritical CO2, to avoid damage to the buttons.

===Supercritical fluid chromatography===
Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) can be used on an analytical scale, where it combines many of the advantages of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). It can be used with non-volatile and thermally labile analytes (unlike GC) and can be used with the universal flame ionization detector (unlike HPLC), as well as producing narrower peaks due to rapid diffusion. In practice, the advantages offered by SFC have not been sufficient to displace the widely used HPLC and GC, except in a few cases such as chiral separations and analysis of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. For manufacturing, efficient preparative simulated moving bed units are available. The purity of the final products is very high, but the cost makes it suitable only for very high-value materials such as pharmaceuticals.

===Chemical reactions===
Changing the conditions of the reaction solvent can allow separation of phases for product removal, or single phase for reaction. Rapid diffusion accelerates diffusion controlled reactions. Temperature and pressure can tune the reaction down preferred pathways, e.g., to improve yield of a particular chiral isomer. There are also significant environmental benefits over conventional organic solvents. Industrial syntheses that are performed at supercritical conditions include those of polyethylene from supercritical ethene, isopropyl alcohol from supercritical propene, 2-butanol from supercritical butene, and ammonia from a supercritical mix of nitrogen and hydrogen. Other reactions were, in the past, performed industrially in supercritical conditions, including the synthesis of methanol and thermal (non-catalytic) oil cracking. Because of the development of effective catalysts, the required temperatures of those two processes have been reduced and are no longer supercritical.

===Impregnation and dyeing===
Impregnation is, in essence, the converse of extraction. A substance is dissolved in the supercritical fluid, the solution flowed past a solid substrate, and is deposited on or dissolves in the substrate. Dyeing, which is readily carried out on polymer fibres such as polyester using disperse (non-ionic) dyes, is a special case of this. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in many polymers, considerably swelling and plasticising them and further accelerating the diffusion process.

===Nano and micro particle formation===

The formation of small particles of a substance with a narrow size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. Supercritical fluids provide a number of ways of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the saturation point of a solute by dilution, depressurization or a combination of these. These processes occur faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, promoting nucleation or spinodal decomposition over crystal growth and yielding very small and regularly sized particles. Recent supercritical fluids have shown the capability to reduce particles up to a range of 5-2000 nm.

===Generation of pharmaceutical cocrystals===
Supercritical fluids act as a new medium for the generation of novel crystalline forms of APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) named as pharmaceutical cocrystals. Supercritical fluid technology offers a new platform that allows a single-step generation of particles that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional techniques. The generation of pure and dried new cocrystals (crystalline molecular complexes comprising the API and one or more conformers in the crystal lattice) can be achieved due to unique properties of SCFs by using different supercritical fluid properties: supercritical CO2 solvent power, anti-solvent effect and its atomization enhancement.

===Supercritical drying===

Supercritical drying is a method of removing solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension drags on small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the supercritical fluid can be removed without distortion. Supercritical drying is used in the manufacturing process of aerogels and drying of delicate materials such as archaeological samples and biological samples for electron microscopy.

=== Supercritical water electrolysis ===
Electrolysis of water in a supercritical state, reduces the overpotentials found in other electrolysers, thereby improving the electrical efficiency of the production of oxygen and hydrogen.

Increased temperature reduces thermodynamic barriers and increases kinetics. No bubbles of oxygen or hydrogen are formed on the electrodes, therefore no insulating layer is formed between catalyst and water, reducing the ohmic losses. The gas-like properties provide rapid mass transfer.

===Supercritical water oxidation===
Supercritical water oxidation uses supercritical water as a medium in which to oxidize hazardous waste, eliminating production of toxic combustion products that burning can produce.

The waste product to be oxidised is dissolved in the supercritical water along with molecular oxygen (or an oxidising agent that gives up oxygen upon decomposition, e.g. hydrogen peroxide) at which point the oxidation reaction occurs.

===Supercritical water hydrolysis===
Supercritical hydrolysis is a method of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under supercritical conditions. The supercritical water, acts as a solvent, a supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat transfer agent and as a source of hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a supercritical state is thereby minimized.

===Supercritical water gasification===
Supercritical water gasification is a process of exploiting the beneficial effect of supercritical water to convert aqueous biomass streams into clean water and gases like H2, CH4, CO2, CO etc.

===Supercritical fluid in power generation===
The efficiency of a heat engine is ultimately dependent on the temperature difference between heat source and sink (Carnot cycle). To improve efficiency of power stations the operating temperature must be raised. Using water as the working fluid, this takes it into supercritical conditions. Efficiencies can be raised from about 39% for subcritical operation to about 45% using current technology. Many coal-fired supercritical steam generators are operational all over the world. Supercritical carbon dioxide is also proposed as a working fluid, which would have the advantage of lower critical pressure than water, but issues with corrosion are not yet fully solved. One proposed application is the Allam cycle.

Supercritical water reactors (SCWRs) are proposed advanced nuclear systems that offer similar thermal efficiency gains.

===Biodiesel production===
Conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel is via a transesterification reaction, where a triglyceride is converted to the methyl esters (of the fatty acids) plus glycerol. This is usually done using methanol and caustic or acid catalysts, but can be achieved using supercritical methanol without a catalyst. The method of using supercritical methanol for biodiesel production was first studied by Saka and his coworkers. This has the advantage of allowing a greater range and water content of feedstocks (in particular, used cooking oil), the product does not need to be washed to remove catalyst, and is easier to design as a continuous process.

===Enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture and storage===
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used to enhance oil recovery in mature oil fields. At the same time, there is the possibility of using &quot;clean coal technology&quot; to combine enhanced recovery methods with carbon sequestration. The CO2 is separated from other flue gases, compressed to the supercritical state, and injected into geological storage, possibly into existing oil fields to improve yields.

At present, only schemes isolating fossil CO2 from natural gas actually use carbon storage, (e.g., Sleipner gas field), but there are many plans for future CCS schemes involving pre- or post-combustion CO2. There is also the possibility to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by using biomass to generate power and sequestering the CO2 produced.

===Enhanced geothermal system===

The use of supercritical carbon dioxide, instead of water, has been examined as a geothermal working fluid.

===Refrigeration===
Supercritical carbon dioxide is also emerging as a useful high-temperature refrigerant, being used in new, CFC/HFC-free domestic heat pumps making use of the transcritical cycle. These systems are undergoing continuous development with supercritical carbon dioxide heat pumps already being successfully marketed in Asia. The EcoCute systems from Japan are some of the first commercially successful high-temperature domestic water heat pumps.

===Supercritical fluid deposition===
Supercritical fluids can be used to deposit functional nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical vapour deposition allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical vapour deposition would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.

===Antimicrobial properties===
CO2 at high pressures has antimicrobial properties. While its effectiveness has been shown for various applications, the mechanisms of inactivation have not been fully understood although they have been investigated for more than 60 years.

<doc id="762692" wikidata="Q1063792" url="?curid=762692" title="Qoo">
<text>is a non-carbonated beverage from the Coca-Cola Company under its Minute Maid subsidiary. Originally introduced in Japan on May 28, 1999, in the Kyushu region and on November 1, 1999, in all of Japan after Coca-Cola executed the creation of a kid- and teen-oriented beverage after a year-long initiative. When Qoo was introduced, it replaced Hi-C in Japan. Qoo is now available throughout much of Asia in a variety of flavors including grape and orange. As soon as Qoo was introduced, the white grape flavor was available at drink fountains in Japan, including at McDonald&#x27;s. In Germany, the product line was sold from January 2003 until November 2005.

The name comes from the mascot&#x27;s reaction to tasting the drink. The mascot was designed by Momoko Maruyama, who created &quot;Deko Boko Friends&quot;. The jingle, for the original Japanese commercial, is sung by Londell &quot;Taz&quot; Hicks, an American now living in Japan who is best known for the AKB48 overture.

Qoo is transliterated in Chinese as 酷兒 (&quot;kùér&quot;). It evokes images of &quot;cool kid&quot; since 酷 (&quot;kù&quot;) is a transliteration of the English word cool and 兒 (&quot;ér&quot;) means &#x27;child&#x27; or &#x27;son&#x27;.

<text>Night Ranger is an American hard rock band from San Francisco, California. The band formed in 1979, and experienced a surge of popularity during the 1980s with the release of several successful albums and hit singles. Guitarist Brad Gillis and drummer Kelly Keagy have been the band&#x27;s only constant members, though bassist Jack Blades performed on all but one of their albums. Other current members of the band include guitarist Keri Kelli and keyboardist Eric Levy.

The band&#x27;s first five albums sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and the group has sold 17 million albums total. The quintet is best known for the power ballad &quot;Sister Christian&quot;, which peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1984, along with several other top 40 hit singles in the 1980s, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me You Love Me&quot;, &quot;When You Close Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Sentimental Street&quot;, &quot;Four in the Morning (I Can&#x27;t Take Any More)&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye.&quot;

After their success waned in the late 1980s, the band split up in 1989, and its members pursued other musical endeavors, including group and solo efforts. Brad Gillis and Kelly Keagy teamed up with bassist Gary Moon and released an album in 1995 under the Night Ranger moniker without the other original members, but the band reunited with Blades, Watson and Fitzgerald in 1996 to release two new albums in the latter half of the decade. Though there have been lineup changes since that time, the band continues to record and tour.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
The group&#x27;s origin can be traced to Rubicon, a pop/funk group led by former Sly and the Family Stone saxophonist Jerry Martini. After Rubicon&#x27;s demise in 1979, bassist Jack Blades formed a trio with two other Rubicon members, drummer Kelly Keagy and guitarist Brad Gillis. Performing under the name Stereo, the threesome added former Montrose keyboardist Alan Fitzgerald in 1980. Fitzgerald recommended enlisting a second virtuoso guitarist and Jeff Watson was added to the group. As Stereo, the band played small clubs around San Francisco such as the Palms in the Tenderloin neighborhood. By late that year, the band changed their name to &quot;Ranger&quot; and began opening for acts such as Sammy Hagar.

=== 1980s ===
In 1982 the band changed its name to Night Ranger after a country band, the Rangers, claimed a trademark infringement. By this point, they had recorded their debut album &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; for Boardwalk Records and done opening stints for ZZ Top and Ozzy Osbourne; the latter had employed Brad Gillis as a replacement guitarist for the recently deceased Randy Rhoads, in the spring and summer of 1982. After Boardwalk folded, producer Bruce Bird secured Night Ranger a deal with MCA on their Camel subsidiary in 1983.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine took a swipe at Night Ranger&#x27;s &quot;formula&quot; of &quot;sub-Broadway&quot; ballads. Other critics were even less flattering, with terms such as &quot;poseurs&quot; and &quot;pomp-rockers&quot; put forth in various music guides, but favorable critics, such as &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, underscored Jack Blades&#x27; puppy-dog appeal, which won over female fans, while Gillis and Watson&#x27;s dueling guitars pleased the same male audience that guitar-driven bands such as Van Halen had already begun to cultivate. Both guitarists also featured prominently in magazines such as &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot;.

&quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;″s first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me You Love Me&quot;, received a boost through its MTV video airplay, and peaked modestly at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Sing Me Away&quot;, a concert favorite sung by Keagy, fell short of the top 40 at a peak position of number 54, though it also was featured on MTV.

Night Ranger&#x27;s popularity rose sharply with their second album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;, which pushed the band from opening act to headliner status by the summer of 1984. Apart from the album&#x27;s first single &quot;(You Can Still) Rock in America&quot;, &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; spun off two hit ballads: &quot;When You Close Your Eyes&quot; (number 14) and &quot;Sister Christian&quot; (number five), written and sung by Kelly Keagy for his younger sister Christine. &quot;Sister Christian&quot; proved to be the band&#x27;s milestone—as well as a millstone since the song pigeonholed the group as a &quot;Power Ballad&quot; band after its release. According to a later interview with Gillis, &quot;Sister Christian&quot; was actually completed in 1982, but he said the band chose not to release it on &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; because they were afraid of losing their hard rock credibility.

In 1985 Night Ranger continued headlining tours in support of their third album &quot;7 Wishes&quot;, which followed a very loose concept of the band flying across the ocean in a WWII B-25 Mitchell bomber. Blades later reported that he and Gillis were fascinated by World War II planes. The video for &quot;Sentimental Street&quot; even placed them in an Amelia Earhart scenario, with the entire band lost at sea. Like &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;, &quot;7 Wishes&quot; garnered three hit singles: &quot;Sentimental Street&quot; (number eight; sung by Kelly Keagy); Blades&#x27; mid-tempo rocker &quot;Four in the Morning (I Can&#x27;t Take Anymore)&quot; (number 19), the title describing the time of night Blades wrote the song; and the pleasant, acoustic-flavored &quot;Goodbye&quot; (number 17), which had the band veering in an overtly folk-rock, even country, direction. According to a 2001 TNN interview, Blades wrote &quot;Goodbye&quot; in memory of his older brother, James, who had died from a heroin overdose several years before.

Between 1984 and 1987, Night Ranger branched out into soundtracks, recording or contributing songs to several teen-oriented films. In 1984, the band released &quot;Interstate Love Affair&quot; (later appearing on &quot;7 Wishes&quot;) for &quot;Teachers&quot;, starring Nick Nolte. In 1985, they also contributed another &quot;7 Wishes&quot; track, &quot;This Boy Needs to Rock&quot;, to the soundtrack of &quot;Explorers&quot;. The band also received exposure on two Anthony Michael Hall vehicles, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984) and &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; (1986). &quot;Rumours in the Air&quot; from &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; appeared on the former, while the latter featured &quot;Wild and Innocent Youth&quot;, a rollicking Blades-Keagy composition that has still never been released on a Night Ranger album or compilation.

In 1987 Blades co-wrote the title theme to the Michael J. Fox film &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, which served as the lead-off single on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Big Life&quot; that same year. Unlike the previous three Night Ranger albums that were produced by Pat Glasser, this one was produced by David Foster and featured more up-tempo songs than power ballads. &quot;Big Life&quot; featured some fairly mature Blades-Keagy songwriting, including the nuanced fan favorite &quot;Rain Comes Crashing Down&quot;, inspired by a stormy California afternoon. &quot;Carry On&quot; was most reminiscent of classic Night Ranger, and was used as the B-side of &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; single. None of the chosen &quot;Big Life&quot; singles hit the top 40. &quot;Secret of My Success&quot; stalled just short of hit-single status at number 64 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hot 100 despite heavy rotation on MTV in the spring of 1987. Night Ranger also openly quarreled with MCA over choosing &quot;Hearts Away&quot; as a single instead of one of their heavier songs. Their label expected another top-10 ballad, like &quot;Sister Christian&quot; or &quot;Sentimental Street&quot;, but despite Keagy&#x27;s passionate vocals, &quot;Hearts Away&quot; failed to catch on, peaking at number 90 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hot 100. The band embarked on a vigorous series of tour dates across North America and the Caribbean, featuring The Outfield as the opening act. A third single/video was released for &quot;Color of Your Smile&quot;, but it failed to reach the charts due to limited airplay.

In early 1988, Fitzgerald left the band before recording began on their fifth album &quot;Man in Motion&quot;, citing his diminished role in the more guitar-driven direction the band was striving for on the new album. A majority of the keyboards on the album were performed by Jesse Bradman, who was also hired to perform during live shows on the album&#x27;s tour. The band attempted a return to their earlier hard rock style to lift the group&#x27;s sagging fortunes. However, none of the singles from the album gained significant radio airplay, as MCA once again chose to release ballads over harder-edged songs. &quot;I Did It for Love&quot; (written by Russ Ballard) fared poorly, even with a cameo appearance by popular actress Morgan Fairchild in the video. The band still views &quot;Restless Kind&quot; as one of their favorites, but it failed to chart. &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Thinking (I&#x27;m Alone Tonight)&quot; and &quot;Reason to Be&quot; were similarly unsuccessful in early 1989. &quot;Man in Motion&quot; thus became the first Night Ranger album not to achieve gold or platinum status.

=== Early 1990s: &quot;Moon Ranger&quot; era ===
After a tour in 1988–89 supporting &quot;Man in Motion&quot; (including an opening slot for Kansas), the members of Night Ranger were feeling the negative effects of constant touring and recording for the past ten years and decided to split up.

Blades left to form the popular super-group Damn Yankees with Ted Nugent and Tommy Shaw of Styx. Gillis and Watson both released their first solo albums, while Watson also joined super-group Mother&#x27;s Army.

In 1991 Keagy and Gillis began working with ex-Three Dog Night vocalist/bassist Gary Moon and guitarist/keyboardist David Zajicek was added in 1993. They recorded the album &quot;Feeding off the Mojo&quot; in 1995 with producer David Prater under the Night Ranger name. The album fared poorly both critically and amongst longtime fans. Said Brad Gillis in a 2017 interview: &quot;Getting together with Gary was an interim thing to keep the Night Ranger brand out there. We had that one record, Feeding off the Mojo. It really wasn’t Night Ranger because Night Ranger is…like any other band, you’ve gotta have that classic voice that sings the songs.&quot;

=== 1996–1999: &quot;Reunion&quot; ===
In 1996, Blades returned to Night Ranger, which ultimately led to a reunion of all five original members. Two studio albums were released on CMC Records, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Neverland&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Seven&quot;, the title of which seems to disregard the &quot;Feeding Off The Mojo&quot; album in the band&#x27;s discography. The new albums were not as successful as their early material in the United States, but the ballad &quot;Forever All Over Again&quot; from &quot;Neverland&quot; did become a minor Adult Contemporary hit in the States. However, the albums did become quite popular in Japan.

The band continued to tour between the members&#x27; various solo albums and projects, mostly on the summer festival circuit. Blades also began a stint as chief counselor for the Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp. In 1999, they joined other 1980s bands in the second installment of the Rock Never Stops Tour, which also happened to feature Blades&#x27; former Damn Yankees bandmate Ted Nugent.

=== 2000–2010: Changing lineups===

In 2003, Fitzgerald once again left the band and was replaced by Great White rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Lardie. Fitzgerald went on to handle offstage keyboards for Van Halen as he had previously done in the 90&#x27;s.

The band recorded their next album &quot;Hole in the Sun&quot; in 2007, which was released overseas in April of that year, but did not appear in the US until July 2008. After working on the album, Watson was fired from the band. Details of the separation have not been made public, but the band made a statement following a post by Watson regarding the split:&quot;We are shocked and saddened to learn of Jeff Watson&#x27;s comments regarding his departure from Night Ranger. There are four sides to this story our three are the same; only Jeff&#x27;s is different. While we don&#x27;t want to get into details at this point in time, we are all truly sorry that our significant and continuing differences with Jeff could not be worked out. Still, we wish Jeff nothing but success in all of his future endeavors and are grateful for his positive contributions in the past.&quot;
Watson&#x27;s replacement for the remainder of their 2007 tour was Winger/Whitesnake guitarist Reb Beach. After the tour, Lardie and Beach returned to their main bands. Christian Matthew Cullen replaced Lardie while Joel Hoekstra took over for Beach by early 2008. Hoekstra was also a member of Trans-Siberian Orchestra and performed in the Broadway production of Rock of Ages concurrently with his membership in Night Ranger.

In January 2008, the band played a special show in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba for U.S. Navy and Marine troops stationed on the island.

=== 2011–2021 ===
In early 2011, Cullen was replaced by Garaj Mahal keyboardist Eric Levy in time for the recording of the band&#x27;s new album &quot;Somewhere in California&quot;. The song &quot;Growin&#x27; Up in California&quot; was released as a single and the band took part in a summer package tour that included Journey and Foreigner. Night Ranger guitarist Joel Hoekstra also did double duty for a stretch of the tour filling in for Mick Jones of Foreigner on several shows.

On March 25, 2012, they gave an a cappella performance of the Star-Spangled Banner before the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California.

In May 2012, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; by recording &quot;24 Strings and a Drummer&quot; as both a live DVD and album in an intimate, all-acoustic setting in front of a select number of fans at TRI Studios in San Rafael, California. The CD/DVD features some of their greatest hits, such as &quot;(You Can Still) Rock in America&quot; and &quot;Sister Christian&quot;, in new acoustic arrangements. The live acoustic album consists of 12 songs plus a bonus track.

On September 1, 2012, they performed as the headlining act for the &quot;River Days&quot; festival in Portsmouth, Ohio. Keyboardist Eric Levy was forced to miss this performance due to his wife giving birth. Brandon Ethridge (from the musicals &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;) handled the keyboards for this performance.

In late 2012, guitarist Keri Kelli (whose resume includes stints with Alice Cooper, Slash, Skid Row, Vince Neil Band, Ratt, Warrant, L.A. Guns, Tal Bachman, John Waite, and others) filled in for Joel Hoekstra while he was playing with Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He did the same in late 2013.

They released their 11th studio album, &quot;High Road&quot; on June 10, 2014. A deluxe edition includes a bonus track and a DVD of music videos and behind-the-scenes extras. Hoekstra left the band in August to join Whitesnake alongside former Night Ranger touring guitarist Reb Beach. Keri Kelli was then formally hired as the permanent replacement for Hoekstra.

The band released a live DVD/double CD recording on December 2, 2016, on Frontiers Records celebrating the band&#x27;s 35th anniversary. &quot;35 Years and a Night in Chicago&quot; was recorded May 7, 2016, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. Included in the release was the new song &quot;Day and Night&quot;. A second encore that night featured another new song, &quot;Running Out of Time&quot;. Both songs were included on the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Up&quot; in March 2017, the first to include Keri Kelli on guitar. The single &quot;Somehow Someway&quot; preceded the album&#x27;s release.

Night Ranger&#x27;s latest studio album &quot;ATBPO&quot; was released on August 6, 2021.

<doc id="762696" wikidata="Q2270905" url="?curid=762696" title="Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in the theory of Lie algebras, the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem (or PBW theorem) is a result giving an explicit description of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. It is named after Henri Poincaré, Garrett Birkhoff, and Ernst Witt.

The terms &quot;PBW type theorem&quot; and &quot;PBW theorem&quot; may also refer to various analogues of the original theorem, comparing a filtered algebra to its associated graded algebra, in particular in the area of quantum groups.

== Statement of the theorem ==

Recall that any vector space &quot;V&quot; over a field has a basis; this is a set &quot;S&quot; such that any element of &quot;V&quot; is a unique (finite) linear combination of elements of &quot;S&quot;. In the formulation of Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem we consider bases of which the elements are totally ordered by some relation which we denote ≤.

If &quot;L&quot; is a Lie algebra over a field K, let &quot;h&quot; denote the canonical K-linear map from &quot;L&quot; into the universal enveloping algebra &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;).

Theorem. Let &quot;L&quot; be a Lie algebra over K and &quot;X&quot; a totally ordered basis of &quot;L&quot;. A &quot;canonical monomial&quot; over &quot;X&quot; is a finite sequence (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) of elements of &quot;X&quot; which is non-decreasing in the order ≤, that is, &quot;x&quot;1 ≤&quot;x&quot;2 ≤ ... ≤ &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Extend &quot;h&quot; to all canonical monomials as follows: if (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is a canonical monomial, let 
:formula_1
Then &quot;h&quot; is injective on the set of canonical monomials and the image of this set formula_2 forms a basis for &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) as a K-vector space.

Stated somewhat differently, consider &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). &quot;Y&quot; is totally ordered by the induced ordering from &quot;X&quot;. The set of monomials

:formula_3

where &quot;y&quot;1 &lt;&quot;y&quot;2 &lt; ... &lt; &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot; are elements of &quot;Y&quot;, and the exponents are &quot;non-negative&quot;, together with the multiplicative unit 1, form a basis for &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;). Note that the unit element 1 corresponds to the empty canonical monomial. The theorem then asserts that these monomials form a basis for &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) as a vector space. It is easy to see that these monomials span &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;); the content of the theorem is that they are linearly independent.

The multiplicative structure of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) is determined by the structure constants in the basis &quot;X&quot;, that is, the coefficients formula_4 such that

:formula_5

This relation allows one to reduce any product of &quot;y&quot;&#x27;s to a linear combination of canonical monomials: The structure constants determine &quot;yiyj – yjyi&quot;, i.e. what to do in order to change the order of two elements of &quot;Y&quot; in a product. This fact, modulo an inductive argument on the degree of (non-canonical) monomials, shows one can always achieve products where the factors are ordered in a non-decreasing fashion.

The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem can be interpreted as saying that the end result of this reduction is &quot;unique&quot; and does not depend on the order in which one swaps adjacent elements.

Corollary. If &quot;L&quot; is a Lie algebra over a field, the canonical map &quot;L&quot; → &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) is injective. In particular, any Lie algebra over a field is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra.

== More general contexts ==

Already at its earliest stages, it was known that K could be replaced by any commutative ring, provided that &quot;L&quot; is a free K-module, i.e., has a basis as above.

To extend to the case when &quot;L&quot; is no longer a free K-module, one needs to make a reformulation that does not use bases. This involves replacing the space of monomials in some basis with the symmetric algebra, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;), on &quot;L&quot;.

In the case that K contains the field of rational numbers, one can consider the natural map from &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) to &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;), sending a monomial formula_6. for formula_7, to the element 
:formula_8
Then, one has the theorem that this map is an isomorphism of K-modules.

Still more generally and naturally, one can consider &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) as a filtered algebra, equipped with the filtration given by specifying that formula_6 lies in filtered degree formula_10. The map &quot;L&quot; → &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) of K-modules canonically extends to a map &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) → &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) of algebras, where &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) is the tensor algebra on &quot;L&quot; (for example, by the universal property of tensor algebras), and this is a filtered map equipping &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) with the filtration putting &quot;L&quot; in degree one (actually, &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) is graded). Then, passing to the associated graded, one gets a canonical morphism &quot;T&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) → gr&quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;), which kills the elements &quot;vw&quot; - &quot;wv&quot; for &quot;v, w&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;, and hence descends to a canonical morphism &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) → gr&quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;). Then, the (graded) PBW theorem can be reformulated as the statement that, under certain hypotheses, this final morphism is an isomorphism &quot;of commutative algebras&quot;.

This is not true for all K and &quot;L&quot; (see, for example, the last section of Cohn&#x27;s 1961 paper), but is true in many cases. These include the aforementioned ones, where either &quot;L&quot; is a free K-module (hence whenever K is a field), or K contains the field of rational numbers. More generally, the PBW theorem as formulated above extends to cases such as where (1) &quot;L&quot; is a flat K-module, (2) &quot;L&quot; is torsion-free as an abelian group, (3) &quot;L&quot; is a direct sum of cyclic modules (or all its localizations at prime ideals of K have this property), or (4) K is a Dedekind domain. See, for example, the 1969 paper by Higgins for these statements.

Finally, it is worth noting that, in some of these cases, one also obtains the stronger statement that the canonical morphism &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) → gr&quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) lifts to a K-module isomorphism &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) → &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;), without taking associated graded. This is true in the first cases mentioned, where &quot;L&quot; is a free K-module, or K contains the field of rational numbers, using the construction outlined here (in fact, the result is a coalgebra isomorphism, and not merely a K-module isomorphism, equipping both &quot;S&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) and &quot;U&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) with their natural coalgebra structures such that formula_11 for &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;). This stronger statement, however, might not extend to all of the cases in the previous paragraph.

== History of the theorem ==
In four papers from the 1880s Alfredo Capelli proved, in different terminology, what is now known as the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem in the case of formula_12 the General linear Lie algebra; while Poincaré later stated it more generally in 1900. Armand Borel says that these results of Capelli were &quot;completely forgotten for almost a century&quot;, and he does not suggest that Poincaré was aware of Capelli&#x27;s result.

Ton-That and Tran have investigated the history of the theorem. They have found out that the majority of the sources before Bourbaki&#x27;s 1960 book call it Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Following this old tradition, Fofanova in her encyclopaedic entry says that Poincaré obtained the first variant of the theorem. She further says that the theorem was subsequently completely demonstrated by Witt and Birkhoff. It appears that pre-Bourbaki sources were not familiar with Poincaré&#x27;s paper.

Birkhoff and Witt do not mention Poincaré&#x27;s work in their 1937 papers. Cartan and Eilenberg call the theorem &quot;Poincaré-Witt Theorem&quot; and attribute the complete proof to Witt. Bourbaki were the first to use all three names in their 1960 book. Knapp presents a clear illustration of the shifting tradition. In his 1986 book he calls it &quot;Birkhoff-Witt Theorem&quot;, while in his later 1996 book he switches to &quot;Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem&quot;.

It is not clear whether Poincaré&#x27;s result was complete. Ton-That and Tran conclude that &quot;Poincaré had discovered and completely demonstrated this theorem at least thirty-seven years before Witt and Birkhoff&quot;. On the other hand, they point out that &quot;Poincaré makes several statements without bothering to prove them&quot;. Their own proofs of all the steps are rather long according to their admission. Borel states that Poincaré &quot;more or less proved the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem&quot; in 1900.

<text>The third USS &quot;Ability&quot; (AFD-7/AFDL-7) was a small auxiliary floating drydock in the service of the United States Navy.

==Construction==
The construction of &quot;AFD-7&quot;, a one-section, steel, floating dry dock built at Eureka, California, by the Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co., was begun sometime early in 1943 and was completed in April 1944.

==Service history==
The small, non-self-propelled auxiliary floating dry dock was then towed to the east coast for duty at the US Coast Guard base at Curtis Bay, Maryland, where she began a long career of docking small naval combatants (up to the size of destroyer escorts) for hull repairs.

At the end of World War II, the vessel returned to the Pacific and proceeded via Pearl Harbor to Guam. While serving there, she was redesignated &quot;AFDL-7&quot; in August 1946. Following brief operations at the naval operating base at Guam, &quot;AFDL-7&quot; was taken out of service on 1 January 1947, and laid up with the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Some time in 1948, she was towed back to Hawaii and laid up at Pearl Harbor. New Year&#x27;s Day 1950, found her at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs, which lasted into the following year. Two years later, she was back at Pearl Harbor still inactive. She was inactive, in reserve, there until June 1970, when she was transferred, on loan, to the United States Army for service in South Vietnam. In October 1971, the small dry dock was returned to the United States Navy and laid up at Guam. On 1 January 1973, she was reactivated and served at various advanced Pacific bases. She remained in this status through 1980.

During this period of service, &quot;AFDL-7&quot; was named &quot;Ability&quot; on 7 June 1979. While at Guam, she was taken out of service early in 1981. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 15 February 1981. She was sold for scrap on 1 July 1982.

<text>The Chicago Marathon is a road marathon held in October in Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the seven World Marathon Majors. Thus, it is also a World Athletics Label Road Race. The Chicago Marathon is one of the largest races by number of finishers worldwide. The race was awarded the World Athletics Heritage Plaque in 2024, for &quot;outstanding contribution to the history and development of road running.&quot;

Annual Chicago marathons were held from 1905 to the 1920s, but the first race in the present series occurred on September 25, 1977, under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon, which drew a field of 4,200 runners. The race has been held every year since, except in 1987 when only a half-marathon was run, and in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It became among the fastest-growing modern-marathon road races in the world, due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances. It generally begins and ends in Grant Park, and travels streets of the North Side, West Side and South Side, before returning to the Loop. The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationships with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances. Since 2008, the race has been sponsored and organized by Bank of America, and is officially known as the Bank of America Chicago Marathon.

The race admits around 50,000 runners and only runners who finish within 6 hours are officially timed. Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery. Although the race has limited registration, exceptions include elite runners, legacy finishers, and charity representatives. In the 21st century, increasingly, local, national and global charities as well as humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising.

==History==
The first modern marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad in Greece generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States. While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis, the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897, soon to be followed by a Chicago annual race. Beginning in 1905, the Chicago Marathon (organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909, then sponsored by the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; after 1910) was held annually, with significant community and spectator support, until the early 1920s.
The first Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That first race began at the Evanston Golf Club and finished in front of a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park Race Track. Beginning with a little over a dozen runners, only seven completed the course. In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Chicagoan Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s, eventually on a revised course that largely resembles today&#x27;s marathon route. The second year, feet bleeding, Canadian Dennis Bennett won, while a band played &quot;Maple Leaf Forever&quot;. In the early years, runners had their own regimens: John Lindquist from Brooklyn took a commanding lead in 1907 while doing whiskey shots, but by mile 23, he was apparently falling asleep; while, the next year, the French-born Chicagoan Albert Corey had more success sipping champagne. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.

It was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the public&#x27;s eyes. Frank Shorter&#x27;s 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle-class American ideals. Then the 1976 New York City Marathon, which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course, popularized the big city marathon. Also that year, a group of runners in Chicago held a meeting at the YMCA on LaSalle Street to discuss interest and begin planning a local marathon. As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon. By the mid-1980s, the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons. During the mid-1980s, it was named America&#x27;s Marathon/Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments. Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathons of the mid-1980s as &quot;The World&#x27;s Marathon&quot;. The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate.
The modern era Chicago Marathon was founded over the objection of Ed Kelly, Chicago Park District Superintendent who refused permission to run in the parks or along the Lake Michigan lakefront. With the help of Lee Flaherty, the event&#x27;s founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s support for the marathon was enlisted. Although Mayor Daley died, his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board. Michael Bilandic, a runner, and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25, 1977. This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon. Flaherty footed the bill for the first race, which had no sponsors. He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon. In 1979, however, Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor.
In the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August. It has from its inception with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers been one of the nation&#x27;s largest marathons. The 2000 running was second only to New York. The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer. By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America&#x27;s most important marathons. In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York&#x27;s). The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen. Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation. At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if not the world. Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison. Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988 and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon. The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions. In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned. In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank. In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon. In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty. In 1998, the race began using transponder timing. In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women&#x27;s world record marathon time, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon.
In 2007, Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank&#x27;s parent company ABN AMRO North America in 2007 and assumed the race&#x27;s title sponsorship. The 2007 race made history with the first ever CEO Marathon Challenge. The race featured a special competition among the CEOs, presidents, company owners and c-suite executives of companies with at least $5 million in annual gross revenue ($2.5 million for women). The 2007 race also made history for having three (men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s &amp; men&#x27;s wheelchair) of its four races decided in the final 100 meters in a day of record setting heat. The race was partially shut down early (after three and a half hours) as temperatures rose to an unseasonably hot 88 °F (31 °C), which surpassed both the temperature records for the Chicago Marathon and official Chicago records for October 7. Over 10,000 registrants chose not to run in the record temperatures, while 10,934 people did not finish (many were called after the course closed early for safety). One runner died, over 30 were hospitalized, and over 400 others sought medical attention. Marathon owner and sponsor Bank of America, which had just acquired LaSalle Bank, has denied culpability. Similar hot conditions have been experienced in other city center races. In 2003, London&#x27;s The British 10K also had extremely hot weather that affected many runners.

The 2020 edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of either transferring their entry to 2021, 2022, or 2023, or obtaining a full refund.

In 2024, Sebastian Coe president of World Athletics, presented the Chicago Marathon with the World Athletics Heritage Plaque, saying: &quot;The Chicago Marathon has an illustrious world record history . . . Coupled with a marathon history in the city dating back to 1905, the Chicago Marathon thoroughly deserves the heritage plaque which recognizes an outstanding contribution to the history and development of road running.&quot;


==Course==

The marathon course is a loop course, starting and ending at Grant Park. From there, the current course winds through 29 of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods. The course loop can be generally divided into three sections: North, West, and South. In each of these sections, three of the city&#x27;s main stadiums are near the course&#x27;s turning points: Wrigley Field to the north; the United Center to the west; and Rate Field to the south. The city&#x27;s fourth professional stadium, Soldier Field, is located near the start/finish area.

For the first three miles, runners wind through Chicago&#x27;s downtown area. Eventually, they head north along LaSalle Street.

Runners are supported by over 12,000 volunteers spread throughout the course including at 20 aid stations located approximate every 1–3 miles. For runners in distress, aid station volunteers include medical staff and ambulatory services are scattered throughout the course.

Digital timers are positioned every 5 kilometers, as well as the halfway point.
==Runner statistics==
The Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings. In 1905, 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon, 15 actually started the race, and 7 finished. For the first &quot;modern&quot; marathon race in 1977, 4,200 people took part. In 1995, 9,000 people registered, and in 1999, over 29,000 people registered. The 2001 marathon run on October 7 reached its cap of 37,500, which was instituted after the 2000 race drew 33,171 runners, just prior to the entry deadline on September 19. In 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 it reached its cap of 40,000. The October 10, 2004, October 9, 2005 and October 22, 2006 races reached their 40,000 entrant caps on August 16, July 14, and May 26 respectively. On April 18, 2007, the 2007 race run on October 7 reached its cap of 45,000 entrants. There was a late registration exemption whereby elite runners (marathon times of less than 2:31/3:01 or half marathon times of 1:11/1:21 for (men/women)) could register until September 1 even though the race had reached its registration cap in the spring. The 40,000 registrants and 33,000 finishers in 2003 made the Chicago Marathon the third or fourth largest marathon depending on which metric (registrants or finishers) is used.

The Chicago Marathon has never excluded women. Historically, however, the women&#x27;s field has been smaller than the men&#x27;s. This seems to be the result of older age categories having large multiples of men to women, but the women are beginning to outnumber the men in the 20s age group of the field.

===Records===
World records have been broken at Chicago seven times. In 1984, Steve Jones broke the world record with 2:08:05. In 1999, Khalid Khannouchi was the first to surpass 2:06:00 with 2:05:42. 

The men&#x27;s course record was broken in the 2013 race by Dennis Kimetto with a time of 2:03:45. On October 8, 2023, the late Kelvin Kiptum set a new world record, and therefore also the Chicago course record, completing the course in 2:00:35.

The women&#x27;s record was broken in two consecutive years. In 2001, Catherine Ndereba broke the record in 2:18:47, and Paula Radcliffe surpassed that mark with 2:17:18 the year after. In 2019, Brigid Kosgei won in a world record time of 2:14:04, which was surpassed in 2023 by Sifan Hassan setting a new course record of 2:13:44. The next year, in 2024, Ruth Chepng&#x27;etich broke the women&#x27;s world record again with a time of 2:09:56.
==Economic impact==
Much of the marathon&#x27;s impact is derived from the tourism industry. More than 10,000 of the runners in 2010 indicated that it was their first visit to Chicago. Of that, 6,000 came from 100 countries. Due to the travelers, the event increases hotel occupancy rates during the marathon. According to an independent study by the University of Illinois, the 2015 marathon contributed an estimated US$277 million worth of activity to the Chicago economy, equivalent to 1,948 jobs.

=== Charity program ===
Since the charity program was officially established in 2002, more than 106,000 runners have raised over $207 million for local, national and global causes.

Charity fundraising is now closely intertwined with the event as the runners now raise money for research, aid the suffering and heighten public awareness of different causes. The marathon offers all registered entrants the opportunity to fundraise for a charity partner. The marathon recognizes four levels of charities based on the number of participants recruited, and fundraising levels.

Runners can also opt out of the public lottery or obtain a guaranteed place after this has been drawn by choosing to run for an official charity. The 2016 event had over 170 charity partners, and raised more than US$16.9 million.

==Deaths==
* 1998 – Kelly Barrett, 43, Littleton, Colorado – Believed to be caused by hyponatremia
* 2000 – Danny Towns, 45, Edmond, Oklahoma – Cardiac arrest
* 2001 – Luke Roach, 22, Seattle, Washington – Collapsed near finish line. Body temperature reached (heat stroke)
* 2003 – Rachael Townsend, 29, The Plains, Ohio – Mitral valve prolapse
* 2007 – Chad Schieber, 35, Midland, Michigan – Mitral valve prolapse
* 2011 – William Caviness, 35, Greensboro, North Carolina – Believed to have died from cardiac arrest five hundred yards from finish line.

<text>In commerce, time to market (TTM) is the length of time it takes from a product being conceived until its being available for sale. The reason that time to market is so important is that being late erodes the addressable market into which producers have to sell their product. A common assumption is that TTM matters most for first-of-a-kind products, but actually a late product launch in any industry can negatively impact revenues—from reducing the window of opportunity to generate revenues to causing the product to become obsolete faster.

==Measuring TTM==
There are no standards for measuring TTM, and measured values can vary greatly. First, there is great variation in how different organizations define the start of the period.

For example, in the automotive industry the development period starts when the product concept is approved. Other organizations realize that little will happen until the project is staffed, which can take a long time after approval if developers are tied up on existing projects. Therefore, they consider the start point when the project is fully staffed. The initial part of a project—before approval has been given or full staffing is allocated—has been called the fuzzy front end, and this stage can consume a great deal of time. Even though the fuzzy front end is difficult to measure, it must be included in TTM measurements for effective TTM management.

Next, definitions of the end of the TTM period vary. Those who look at product development as engineering say the project is finished when engineering department transfers it to manufacturing. Others define the conclusion as when they ship the first copy of the new product or when a customer buys it. High-volume industries will often define the end point in terms of reaching a certain production volume, such as a million units per month.

Finally, TTM measurements vary greatly depending on complexity –- complexity of the product itself, the technologies it incorporates, its manufacturing processes, or the organizational complexity of the project (for example, outsourced components). New-to-the-world products are much slower than derivatives of existing products. Some companies have been successful in putting their products into categories of newness, but establishing levels of complexity remains elusive.

Although TTM can vary widely, all that matters is an organization&#x27;s TTM capability relative to its direct competitors. Organizations in other industries may be much faster, but do not pose a competitive threat, although one may be able to learn from them and adapt their techniques.

==TTM and quality==
A tacit assumption of many is that TTM and product quality are opposing attributes of a development process. TTM may be improved (shortened) by skipping steps of the development process, thus compromising product quality. For those who use highly structured development processes such as Phase–gate model or Six Sigma, product development is often viewed as a clearly defined sequence of steps to be followed. Skipping a step—due to perceived time pressure, for example—may not only undercut quality but can ultimately lengthen TTM if the organization must complete or repeat the step later.

Other organizations operate more aggressively, recognizing that not all steps need to be completed for every project. Furthermore, they actively apply tools and techniques that will shorten or overlap steps, cut decision-making time, and automate activities. Many such tools and techniques are available (see References below).

==Types of TTM==
Organizations pursue TTM improvement for a variety of reasons. Some variations of TTM are
* Flexibility to catch the market window. It is the optimal time to launch a product and maximize the profit. Before this point, your product will never reach the full targeted audience. After this point, the sales will never reach the optimal peak.
* Pure speed, that is, brings the product to market as quickly as possible. This is valuable in fast-moving industries, but it is not always the best objective.
* More predictable schedules. Rather than reaching the market as soon as possible, delivering on schedule, for example to have the new product available for a trade show, can be more valuable. In addition to processes such as Stage-Gate or Six Sigma, project risk management (see References below) is an effective tool here.
* Minimizing resources, especially labor. Many managers figure that the shorter the project the less it will cost, so they attempt to use TTM as a means of cutting expenses. A primary means of reducing TTM is to staff the project more heavily, so a faster project may actually be more expensive.
* Flexibility to make changes. Product innovation is intimately tied to change, and often the need for change appears midstream in a project. Consequently, the ability to make changes during development without being too disruptive can be valuable. For example, one&#x27;s goal could be to satisfy customers, which could be achieved by adjusting product requirements during development in response to customer feedback. Then TTM could be measured from the last change in requirements until the product is delivered.
These types of TTM illustrate that an organization&#x27;s TTM goals should be aligned with its business strategy rather than pursuing speed blindly.

<text>Syed Nazrul Islam (1925 – 3 November 1975) was a Bangladeshi politician and a senior leader of the Awami League. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, he was declared as the Vice President of Bangladesh by the Provisional Government. He served as the Acting President in the absence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

==Early life==
Syed Nazrul Islam was born in 1925, into a Bengali Muslim family of Syeds in the village of Bir Dampara, Jashodal Union in Kishoreganj (then Mymensingh District) of the Bengal Presidency. He obtained degrees in history and law from the University of Dhaka and was an active student political leader in the Muslim League. Syed captained his college&#x27;s cricket and hockey teams and participated in the Pakistan movement. He entered the civil service of Pakistan in 1949 but resigned in 1951 to work as a professor of history at the Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh, where he also practised law.

==Political career==
Nazrul Islam&#x27;s political career began when he joined the Awami Muslim League and participated in the Language Movement in 1952, for which he was arrested by police. He would rise to various provincial and central party leadership positions, becoming a close confidante of the party&#x27;s leader Sheikh Mujib. He was jailed during the Six Point Demand movement. He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1970, where he served briefly as deputy leader of the majority. Following the arrest of Mujib on 25 March 1971 by Pakistani forces, Syed escaped to Mujibnagar with other party leaders and proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh. Sheikh Mujib was elected as the President of Bangladesh, and Syed stepped in as the acting President, with Tajuddin Ahmed as the government&#x27;s prime minister. Syed played a key role in leading the nationalist cause, co-ordinating the Mukti Bahini guerrilla force and winning support from India and other nations.

After the independence of Bangladesh, Syed was appointed minister of industries, the deputy leader in parliament and a member of the constitution committee. When Mujib banned other political parties and assumed sweeping powers as president in 1975, Syed was appointed vice-chairman of the BAKSAL, the renamed Awami League.

==Personal life==

Nazrul Islam married Syeda Nafisa Islam and had 4 sons and 2 daughters. His four sons were Sayed Ashraful Islam,Syed Manzurul Islam Manju, Syed Shariful Islam and Syed Shafayetul Islam, and his two daughters were Syeda Zakia Noor Lipi MP and Syeda Rafia Noor.

Syed Nazrul Islam also had a younger brother, who was a Freedom Fighter, the late Syed Wahidul Islam, and he had three nephews and five nieces. His three nephews were Syed Tariqul Islam, Syed Ashfaqul Islam, and Syed Affaqul Islam. His five nieces were Syeda Nasima Islam, Laila Morshed Supa, Syeda Nazma Sheema, Syeda Farhana Islam, and Syeda Munalisa Islam.

==Death==
Following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975, Syed went into hiding with other Mujib loyalists such as Tajuddin Ahmad, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman and Muhammad Mansur Ali, but was ultimately arrested by the regime of the new president Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. The four leaders were imprisoned in the Dhaka Central Jail and assassinated on 3 November under controversial and mysterious circumstances known as the Jail Killing. This day is commemorated every year in Bangladesh as Jail Killing Day. Captain (relieved) Kismat Hashem was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for the killings. He died due to cardiac arrest in Canada.

==Legacy==

Government-run Shahid Syed Nazrul Islam Medical College in Kishoreganj is named in his memory. Sayed Ashraful Islam is son of Sayed Nazrul Islam.

<doc id="762713" wikidata="Q457201" url="?curid=762713" title="Melchior Ndadaye">
<text>Melchior Ndadaye (28 March 1953 – 21 October 1993) was a Burundian banker and politician who became the first democratically elected and first Hutu president of Burundi after winning the landmark 1993 election. Though he attempted to smooth the country&#x27;s bitter ethnic divide, his reforms antagonised soldiers in the Tutsi-dominated army, and he was assassinated amidst a failed military coup in October 1993, after only three months in office. His assassination sparked an array of brutal tit-for-tat massacres between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups, and ultimately led to the decade-long Burundi Civil War.

== Early life ==
Melchior Ndadaye was born on 28 March 1953 in the commune of Nyabihanga, Ruanda-Urundi. The son of Pie Ndadaye and Thérèse Bandushubwenge, he was the first of ten children in a Hutu family. He attended primary school in Mbogora and in 1966 enrolled at the normal school in Gitega. Following the 1972 Ikiza, in which the government of Burundi targeted and massacred educated Hutus, he fled to Rwanda, fearing what would happen if he returned to school in Gitega. He enrolled at the Groupe Scolaire Officiel in Butare to complete his secondary studies, graduating in 1975. He then enrolled at the National University of Rwanda to take up pedagogical studies, earning a &quot;license degree&quot; in 1980. Ndadaye taught at the Lycée pédagogique in Save, southern Rwanda, from 1980 to 1983.

== Early political involvement and return to Burundi ==

Ndadaye became involved in politics while in Rwanda, and in 1976 founded the Mouvement des Étudiants Progressistes Barundi au Rwanda (BEMPERE), a progressive movement for exiled Burundian Hutu students. In August 1979 Ndadaye and other Burundian exiles founded the Burundi Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Umugambwe wa&#x27;Bakozi Uburundi&quot;, UBU), a Marxist-Lenininist political party. He served as the party&#x27;s secretary for information and editor-in-chief of its newspapers, &quot;Le Flambeau&quot; and &quot;Ukuri&quot;. From 1982–1983 ideological divisions arose in UBU, with one faction advocating armed revolution and another—led by Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Ndadaye—advocating democracy and political freedom. Ndadaye published a document calling for an &quot;alliance of Burundian progressive forces,&quot; further distancing himself from other members. As a result of the fracture, Ndadaye left UBU and returned to Burundi in 1983.

In July 1984 Ndadaye married Laurence Nininahazwe, with whom he had three children. From that year until 1986 he worked at the Centre Neuro-Psychiatrique Kamenge in Bujumbura. During this time he was a member of another political party, Front de Lutte pour la Démocratie (FROLUDE), but the group disbanded after fears grew that it had been infiltrated by the government and some of its members were arrested. From 1986 until 1988 Ndadaye directed the Coopératives d&#x27;Épargne et de Crédit in Gitega. In 1989 he returned to Bujumbura and became head of Meridian Bank Biao&#x27;s credit service. He then took up study with the Institut Technique de Banque at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers in Paris, securing a diploma in higher banking studies in 1992.

== Leader of FRODEBU ==
In June 1986 Ndadaye and other former UBU members, seeing the growing international preference for democracy and peaceful electoral processes, founded a new underground political movement, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU). He subsequently became the party&#x27;s president. In 1988 he was named first secretary of the Gitega branch of the Union des Travailleurs du Burundi, a labor union affiliated with the ruling Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party. That year Burundi became beset by ethnic violence, and on 23 October he criticised the government of President Pierre Buyoya in a meeting called by the governor of Gitega Province. As a result, he was imprisoned for two months in Rumonge. In February 1991 Ndadaye became one of the twelve founding members of the Iteka League, a human rights association. In March Buyoya appointed a 35-member Constitution Commission to study the country&#x27;s ethnic and political problems and draft a new basic law. Ndadaye was the sole member of the political opposition to serve on it. The body produced a 145-page report titled, &quot;The Democratisation of Institutions and Political Life in Burundi.&quot; Ndadaye resigned in August, citing the commission&#x27;s lack of diversity, and omissions and undemocratic provisions in the report. He was also dissatisfied with UPRONA&#x27;s control over the political transition.

The 1991 constitution made provisions for multiparty politics, and on 25 May 1992 FRODEBU petitioned the Ministry of Interior for official recognition, which was granted on 23 July. Ndadaye remained critical of the transition, expressing anger at the government&#x27;s domination by UPRONA members and accusing UPRONA activists of using state resources to support their activities. On 18 April 1993 a FRODEBU congress nominated Ndadaye as its candidate of choice for the upcoming presidential election. Viewed as a liberator of Burundi&#x27;s Hutus, he also obtained the support of a coalition of minor Hutu-dominated opposition parties, the Forces pour le Changement Démocratique (FCD). Ntibantunganya, another founding FRODEBU member, said that Ndadaye further benefitted from a public perception that he was a &quot;political virgin&quot;. Advocating change, Ndadaye and his allies made frequent use of the phrase &quot;new Burundi&quot; (Kirundi: &quot;uburundi bushasha&quot;). He put forward a platform titled, &quot;Our proposals to build a new Burundi&quot;, comprising 46 specific measures involving political, economic, and socio-cultural issues. He advocated disbanding the Tutsi-dominated armed forces and recreating the army and gendarmerie based on equitable recruitment from each colline, thus ensuring more ethnically balanced forces. FRODEBU&#x27;s opponents denounced the party as a Hutu extremist organization and attempted to tie it to the Parti pour la libération du peuple Hutu (PALIPEHUTU), a rebel group. Ndadaye decried this characterisation, and instead accused UPRONA&#x27;s leadership of attempting to sow ethnic division.

Ndadaye, endorsed by FRODEBU and the FCD, competed against UPRONA&#x27;s candidate, Buyoya, and Pierre Claver Sendegeya of the Parti pour la Réconciliation du Peuple. In the 1 June presidential election, Ndadaye won 64.86 percent of the vote, whereas Buyoya only garnered 33.20 percent and Sendegeya got 1.26 percent. The poll was certified by international observers as being free and fair, and none of the candidates contested the results. UPRONA members were stunned by Ndadaye&#x27;s landslide victory. According to Buyoya, some party members asked him to falsify the returns to show a victory for himself, but he refused, feeling it would compromise his integrity and risk civil war. Foreign observers were also surprised by Buyoya&#x27;s loss, but were generally satisfied that a civilian would assume power and that democratic processes were being followed. In the subsequent parliamentary elections on 29 June, FRODEBU won 71.4 percent of the vote and earned 80 percent of the seats in the National Assembly.

Rumours circulated in Burundi that the army would attempt to intervene to disrupt the transition. Ndadaye reassured a supporter that &quot;They can kill Ndadaye, but they can&#x27;t kill all 5 million Ndadayes.&quot; A plot from a handful of officers discovered on 3 July to seize Ndadaye&#x27;s residence failed due to a lack of support from other components of the military, resulting in several arrests, including that of its suspected leader, Lieutenant Colonel Slyvestre Ningaba, who had been &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; for Buyoya. Buyoya and army leaders condemned the coup attempt. When Ndadaye called Buyoya to ask him about the coup, Buyoya joked with him that it was a &quot;kind of baptism of fire&quot;.

== Presidency ==

Ndadaye was sworn-in as President of Burundi on 10 July 1993. He became both the first democratically-elected head of state and first Hutu president of Burundi. In his inaugural address he promised to create a &quot;new Burundi&quot;. He assembled a government of 23 ministers, including 13 FRODEBU and six UPRONA members. Nine of the ministers were Tutsi, including Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi, a member of UPRONA. He also appointed a Council of National Unity comprising 15 Hutus and 15 Tutsis who were to advise him on ethnic concerns.

Despite his cautious approach to the presidency, some of his actions nevertheless provoked tensions in the community. He questioned contracts and concessions approved under previous Tutsi governments, which threatened the economics of the powerful Tutsi elite and army. He began reforms to the military, shifting the national police to a separate command and changing the admission requirements for the military and police so as to reduce the entrenched Tutsi dominance. The dominance of FRODEBU caused problems at a local level, as Ndadaye&#x27;s Hutu supporters took over many positions previously held by Tutsis in the public service, and botched the resettlement of refugees returning after the 1972 massacres in such a way as to leave many Tutsi families homeless. The issues were exacerbated by the newly-free press, who began reporting in such a way as to inflame ethnic tensions. He appointed Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu as Army Chief of Staff.

Internationally, Ndadaye attended the signing of the Arusha Accords—a peace agreement designed to end the Rwandan Civil War—on 4 August. His relationship with Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was tenuous. In September he went to the United Nations headquarters and addressed the General Assembly. On 18 October he attended a summit of Francophone countries in Mauritius.

== Assassination and legacy ==
=== Prelude ===
On 19 October 1993, an army officer approached the wife of Minister of Communications Jean‐Marie Ngendahayo and informed her that personnel in the army headquarters were plotting against the president. At 15:00 on 20 October, Major Isaïe Nibizi, the officer responsible for presidential security, informed Ndadaye&#x27;s chef de cabinet of suspicious military movements. Later that afternoon, Ndadaye hosted a cabinet meeting in Bujumbura to mark the first 100 days of his presidency (which had passed two days prior) and discuss what his government had accomplished in comparison to its campaign promises. At the conclusion of the meeting Ngendahayo requested to speak in private with Ndadaye. In the president&#x27;s office, Ngendahayo raised concerns about Ndadaye&#x27;s safety. Instead of informing the president about the vague threat his wife had learned of, he told him that he felt it strange that UPRONA, the Tutsi-dominated opposition party, was denouncing the government&#x27;s popular policy of allowing thousands of Burundian refugees to return to the country before the commune elections in December. Ngendahayo stated that he thought this would cost UPRONA the elections, and thus the only reason they would oppose the policy is if they planned to take power via an assassination and a coup. He also requested that Ndadaye further consider a previous report declaring his personal security to be inadequate. Ndadaye instructed Ngendahayo to bring him the Minister of Defence, Colonel Charles Ntakije.

Ntakije told Ndadaye that a coup was being planned by the 11th Armoured Car Battalion, which was going to attack the Presidential Palace at 02:00 on 21 October. When asked how he would respond, Ntakije said he would gather trusted officers and organise an ambush if the battalion left its camp. Ndadye inquired about the status of Sylvestre Ningaba, a former army colonel who had been arrested in July for attempting a coup, and asked if he could be relocated to a different prison so the putschists could not obtain his help. Ntakije said that this would not be possible due to the objections of prison officials to transferring detainees at nighttime, but he assured the president that he would station an additional armoured car at the Presidential Palace for extra security. Ndadaye spoke about training possibilities for the Presidential Guard before dismissing both ministers for the evening and going to the palace. When he arrived he told his wife, Laurence, about the coup plot, but was mostly assured by what Ntakije had said to him. Writing on Ndadaye&#x27;s willingness to return to the palace despite the threat, journalists Gaëtan Sebudandi and Pierre-Olivier Richard asserted that the president was probably convinced that the coup would be easily foiled, just like the plot on 3 July. Krueger wrote, &quot;That a president as intelligent as Ndadaye&#x27;s associates found him to be would so readily accept such scant preparations for his protection seems, in retrospect, remarkable to an outsider...However, in a capital perpetually nervous with rumour, it becomes exhausting to take seriously every reported threat. Moreover, Ndadaye may have had a kind of &quot;che sarà, sarà&quot;, fatalistic attitude that could come to a person who, having overcome numerous life threatening challenges, was unwilling to run away from the position and responsibilities he had so recently assumed.&quot;

=== Attack on the Presidential Palace ===
At around midnight on 20 October, putschists of the 11th Armoured Car Battalion departed from Camp Muha in over a dozen armoured cars and took up positions around Bujumbura. Within an hour they surrounded the Presidential Palace. They were joined by hundreds of soldiers and gendarmes from the other eleven military camps in Bujumbura, including members of the 1st Parachute Battalion and a few personnel from the 2nd Commando Battalion. They prepared to attack the palace, which was only guarded by 38 soldiers of the Presidential Guard and two armoured cars. Shortly before 01:00 on 21 October, Ntakije called the president and told him that armoured cars had left Camp Muha for an unknown destination and advised him to leave the palace immediately. Ndadaye then attempted to reach Captain Ildephonse Mushwabure, the commander of the palace guard, by phone, but when he did not answer he went into the palace gardens. At 01:30 the putschists fired a single shot, and shortly thereafter at least one armoured car blasted a hole in the grounds wall and began bombarding the palace with cannon fire. Laurence Ndadaye took her three children into an interior room and sheltered them under tables, while the president was disguised in a military uniform by his guards and placed in one of their armoured cars in the garden, where he remained for the next six hours.

=== Death ===
At about 7:30, Laurence Ndadaye and her children left the palace and reached one of the two cars on the grounds, which would not start. They quickly reunited with President Ndadaye, who was in the other armoured vehicle. The family considered scaling the perimeter wall to go to the neighbouring Meridian Hotel, but found that the palace was completely surrounded by putschists. At Captain Mushwabure&#x27;s direction, Ndadaye decided to be taken with his family to Camp Muha. At 7:30 they left in their armoured car, and were trailed by the putschists&#x27; vehicles. Upon arriving at the base at 8:00, their car was surrounded by putschists of the 1st Battalion. Ndadaye was taken by Army Chief of Staff Bikomagu to a meeting with other senior officers of the army. About an hour later he returned with Secretary of State for Security Colonel Lazare Gakoryo, having reached a verbal agreement with the officers. Ndadaye reentered the armoured car with Gakoryo to finalise their understanding on paper, but when the secretary of state exited the vehicle soldiers began shouting for the president to come out. Once he did, Bikomagu quieted the crowd and Ndadaye appealed to the soldiers to negotiate peacefully with him.

Soldiers began closing in on the president, and Bikomagu instructed them to let his family go since they were &quot;of no interest&quot; to them. He directed a driver to take the family away, and at Laurence&#x27;s direction, the soldier brought them to the French embassy, where they were allowed to take refuge. Bikomagu then pointed at President Ndadaye and said to the putschists, &quot;He is the one you were looking for. Here he is. Do what you want with him.&quot; They placed Ndadaye in a jeep and drove him to the 1st Parachute Battalion&#x27;s camp nearby, closely followed by Bikomagu, Gakoryo, and Major Nibizi. The president was taken to an office where ten junior officers—specifically assigned to the task—killed him. A coroner&#x27;s report later found that Ndadaye was held by a cord around his neck while the soldiers bayoneted him 14 times. Half of the wounds penetrated his thorax and the subsequent bleeding filled up his lungs, killing him. The soldiers then dug a mass grave in the centre of the camp, where they buried Ndadaye, President of the National Assembly Pontien Karibwami, Vice President of the National Assembly Gilles Bimazubute, Minister of Home Affairs and Communal Development Juvénal Ndayikeza, and Director of Intelligence Richard Ndikumwami. After several hours the soldiers realised that international opinion would strongly disapprove of such treatment of the bodies, so they exhumed them and allowed family members to collect them. Ndadaye was reburied on 6 December in a ceremony in Bujumbura alongside other officials killed in the coup.

=== Aftermath ===

Ndadaye&#x27;s death sparked severe ramifications across the country. The attempted coup rapidly failed, as Francois Ngeze, the civilian politician installed as temporary head of state, refused to support the coup leaders and called for Prime Minister Kinigi, who had survived the coup and was in hiding at the French embassy to assume control, a move soon backed by key military chiefs. Kinigi was thus appointed as acting president while a resolution to the constitutional crisis caused by the assassination of both the president and the president of the assembly was found. The United Nations Security Council condemned the assassination and coup, and was soon followed in doing so by the United Nations General Assembly. Many thousands of civilians, on both sides, were killed in the resulting carnage, with estimates varying but generally agreed to be above 100,000. The ongoing violence developed into the decade-long Burundi Civil War.

A United Nations investigation into Ndadaye&#x27;s murder, the result of which was released in 1996, accused the army command of being responsible for the assassination and of being complicit in the resulting massacres by Tutsi troops. It did not name specific figures as being responsible, but Buyoya, Ndadaye&#x27;s predecessor as president, has long been suspected of having some role in the assassination.

In 1999, as part of attempts to end the civil war, an array of arrests were made of those suspected of involvement in the Ndadaye assassination. Five men, including the alleged ringleader, army officer Paul Kamana, were sentenced to death, and 74 others received sentences ranging from one year to twenty years. Most of the high-ranking officials charged, however, were acquitted, in a verdict condemned by Ndadaye&#x27;s supporters.

In Burundi, Ndadaye has been posthumously remembered as a martyr for democracy and a national hero. Ndadaye Day is observed annually on 21 October to commemorate his death. The day is commemorated by the laying of a wreath on the tomb of Ndadaye. During President Pierre Nkurunziza&#x27;s tenure as president, the government erected a monument jointly honouring Ndadaye and Louis Rwagasore at a roundabout in Bujumbura.

<text>Niels Thomasius Neergaard (27 June 1854 – 2 September 1936) was a Danish historian and political figure, a member of the Liberal Moderate Venstre and since 1910 of Venstre. He served as Council President of Denmark between 1908 and 1909 and as Prime Minister of Denmark and Finance Minister from 1920 to 1924. He was also minister of defence from 1908 to 1909, and finance minister on three more occasions: August to October 1909, 1910 to 1913 and 1926 to 1929.

==Biography==
Neergaard was educated at the University of Copenhagen, from which he attained the degrees cand.mag. in history and cand.polit. in 1879 and 1881, respectively.

Neergaard&#x27;s greatest challenges as a politician were as prime minister and finance minister after the Easter Crisis of 1920, organizing the return of South Jutland to Danish rule and having to deal with the economic crisis brought on by World War I. He also had a significant influence on the content of the Constitution of 1915.

Neergaard&#x27;s largest work as a historian, &quot;Under junigrundloven&quot; (1892-1916), is still considered the primary work on Danish politics 1848–1866. In addition to his political activities and work as a historian he also dealt with journalism, and in 1884 he founded a cultural and literary magazine, &quot;Tilskueren&quot;.

<doc id="762722" wikidata="Q1619015" url="?curid=762722" title="Nick Begich Sr.">
<text>Nicholas Joseph Begich Sr. (born April 6, 1932 – disappeared October 16, 1972; declared dead December 29, 1972) was an American counselor, educator and politician. He served in the Alaska state senate for eight years before being elected in 1970 as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Alaska. He is presumed to have died in the crash of a light aircraft in Alaska in October 1972; his body was never found. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life and education==
Begich was born and raised in Eveleth, Minnesota. His father, John Begich (né Begić), was born in Podlapača, Udbina, Croatia. Nick Sr.&#x27;s mother, Anna (née Martinić), was also of Croatian descent. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Cloud State University in 1952 and a Master of Arts from the University of Minnesota in 1954. He took graduate courses at the University of Colorado Boulder and University of North Dakota.

Both Begich and his brother Joseph made careers in politics. Joseph Begich stayed in Eveleth. He served 18 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives from that base.

==Career==
Begich moved to Alaska after college, where he worked as a guidance counselor in the schools of Anchorage. He was later Director of Student Personnel for the Anchorage school system before becoming Superintendent of Schools at Fort Richardson.

In 1962, Begich was elected to the Alaska Senate, where he served for eight years. Begich also taught political science during parts of this period at the University of Alaska at Anchorage.

In 1968, Begich ran at-large for Alaska&#x27;s only U.S. House seat. He lost to the incumbent, Republican Howard Pollock.

In 1970, Pollock ran for Governor of Alaska, and Begich ran again for Congress. He succeeded in defeating the Republican banker Frank Murkowski. The latter was later elected as a U.S. Senator and then as Governor of Alaska. In 1972 in his re-election race, Begich was opposed by Republican state senator Don Young.

Begich&#x27;s plane went down weeks before the election but his body was not found. His name was still on the ballot, and Begich posthumously won the 1972 election, with 56% to Don Young&#x27;s 44%. However, after Begich was declared dead, a special election was held. Young won the seat and retained it until his own death on March 18, 2022.

==Disappearance==
On October 16, 1972, Begich and House Majority Leader Hale Boggs (D-Louisiana), were two of the four men on board a twin-engine Cessna 310 when the airplane disappeared during a flight from Anchorage to Juneau. Also on board were Begich&#x27;s aide, Russell Brown, and the pilot, Don Jonz. The four were heading to a campaign fundraiser for Begich.

In an enormous search effort, search and rescue aircraft of the United States Coast Guard, Navy, Army, Air Force, Civil Air Patrol and civilians were deployed to look for the four men and the missing Cessna 310. After proceeding for 39 days, the air search was suspended on November 24, 1972. Neither the airplane nor any of its four occupants was ever found. The four men were all officially declared dead on December 29, 1972.

The Cessna was required to carry an emergency locator transmitter (ELT) per Alaska state statute section 02.35.115, Downed Aircraft Transmitting Device. This took effect on September 6, 1972, five weeks before the plane disappeared. The Alaska statute made reference to Federal Aviation Regulation 91.52, published on September 21, 1971, which mandated ELTs in aircraft such as this. It had an effective date of December 30, 1973, for existing aircraft.

No ELT signal determined to be from the plane was heard during the search. In its report on the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the pilot&#x27;s portable ELT, permissible in lieu of a fixed ELT on the plane, was found in an aircraft at Fairbanks, Alaska. The report also notes that a witness saw an unidentified object in the pilot&#x27;s briefcase that, except for color, resembled the portable ELT. The NTSB concluded that neither the pilot nor aircraft had an ELT.

==Legacy==
In 1972, the tallest building in Whittier, Alaska, was renamed as Begich Towers in memory of Congressman Nick Begich. Begich Peak, which is three miles north of the &quot;Begich, Boggs Visitor Center&quot; at Portage Lake, was also named after him.

In November 2015, a &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; story detailed the work of journalist Jonathan Walczak. Since 2012 he has investigated the plane crash and subsequent events in an effort to determine the fate of the flight that carried Begich and Boggs.

Walczak created a podcast about Begich&#x27;s disappearance, which was released by iHeartMedia in the summer of 2020. The podcast, called &quot;Missing in Alaska&quot;, explored such conspiracy theories as that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover or Detroit mobsters operating in Tucson had arranged for Hale Boggs to be assassinated.

==Electoral history==

==Personal life==
In 1956, Begich married Margaret Jean Jendro, nicknamed Pegge. They had six children together: Nick Jr., Mark, Nichelle, Tom, Stephanie, and Paul.

Begich&#x27;s widow, Pegge, married again, to Jerry Max Pasley. Their marriage did not last long. She ran against the incumbent Don Young for the US House of Representatives seat in 1984 and 1986 but was unable to defeat him.

Two sons followed their parents into politics. Mark was elected as a member of the Anchorage Borough Assembly, then became mayor. He was narrowly elected in 2008 as the junior U.S. senator from Alaska. The incumbent, Republican Ted Stevens, had been convicted of seven felonies, eight days before the 2008 election, after being caught up in the Alaska political corruption probe. The charges against Stevens were later set aside because of prosecutorial misconduct.

In 2016, Tom Begich won the Democratic primary nomination for Seat J in the Alaska Senate. He faced little opposition in that general election and since, and was redistricted to Seat I in 2020. He continued to hold that office until 2023.

Nick Begich III, son of Nick Jr. and grandson of Nick Begich, unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Seat A in District 2 of the Anchorage City Council in 2016, for Alaska&#x27;s at-large House Seat in the 2022 special election, and for the same seat in the 2022 regular election. He won Alaska&#x27;s at-large House seat in the 2024 election as a Republican.

<text>The Dungeness River is a long river located in the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It rises near Mount Constance in the Olympic Mountains within the Olympic National Park, flows through the Buckhorn Wilderness, passes by the town of Sequim, and empties into the Strait of Juan de Fuca at Dungeness Bay, behind the Dungeness Spit. One of its main tributaries is the Gray Wolf River. It is crossed by the Dungeness River Bridge.

==History==
The river was named for Dungeness Spit. The name &quot;Dungeness&quot; refers to the Dungeness headland in England. It was given by George Vancouver in 1792, who wrote: &quot;The low sandy point of land, which from its great resemblance to Dungeness in the British Channel, I called New Dungeness.&quot;

The Dungeness River, along with the Chehalis River, is part of only two river basins in Washington state that are granted protections and rights under &quot;in-stream flow regulation&quot;. Passed in 1976, the law allows the river the right to maintain its own water levels.

==Geography==
Scarborough Island is a small eyot (river island) in the Dungeness River, in Sequim, Washington. About one acre square, it is located near Dungeness Meadows and can be seen from the Dungeness River Dike.

<text>USS &quot;Abinago&quot; (YTB-493/YTM-493) was a large harbor tug in the service of the United States Navy. Her name means &quot;in the morning&quot; in the Navajo language.

She was laid down on 25 September 1944 at Brooklyn, New York by Ira S. Bushey and Sons, launched on 22 December 1944, and delivered to the Navy on 14 June 1945.

==Service history==
Placed in service with the 1st Fleet, the tug served on the west coast until May 1947, when she was placed in reserve at San Diego. By January 1949, the ship had moved to the 15th Naval District in Panama, but apparently remained in reserve. In October 1950, she was placed back in service for duty in the 5th Naval District, based at Norfolk. Late in 1958, &quot;Abinago&quot; was reassigned from the 5th Naval District to &quot;advanced bases, Atlantic.&quot; However, extant records reveal no specific facts concerning her duties. During her somewhat over eight years in that assignment, the vessel was reclassified a medium harbor tug in February 1962 and simultaneously redesignated YTM-493. &quot;Abinago&quot; was in the Atlantic Inactive Fleet between March 1967 and February 1968 and then resumed active service with the Atlantic Fleet.

In 1973, the tug was listed as active in the 5th Naval District but preparing for inactivation. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1975 and she was turned over to the Government Services Administration for disposal. Sold to the University of Georgia Institute of Natural Resources, she was transferred on 21 November 1975.

<text>Erwin Neher (; ; born 20 March 1944) is a German biophysicist, specializing in the field of cell physiology. For significant contribution in the field, in 1991 he was awarded, along with Bert Sakmann, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for &quot;their discoveries concerning the function of single ion channels in cells&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Neher was born in Landsberg am Lech, Upper Bavaria, the son of Elisabeth (née Pfeiffer), a teacher, and Franz Xaver Neher, an executive at a dairy company. He studied physics at the Technical University of Munich from 1963 to 1966.

In 1966, he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study in the US. He spent a year at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and earned a master&#x27;s degree in biophysics. While at the Charles Stevens Laboratory at Yale University for post-doctoral work he met fellow scientist Eva-Maria Neher, whom he married in 1978 and subsequently the couple had five children – Richard, Benjamin, Carola, Sigmund, and Margret.

In 2003 Neher was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

==Career==
In 1986, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Bert Sakmann. In 1987, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. Along with Bert Sakmann, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991 for &quot;their discoveries concerning the function of single ion channels in cells&quot;. Neher and Sakmann were the first to record the currents of single ion channels on a live cell (they were first recorded using the lipid bilayer method) through their development of the patch-clamp technique, a project Neher began as a postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of Charles F. Stevens at Yale.

Since 1983, he became a director at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen and led the Department for Membrane Biophysics. He turned into an emeritus director of the Institute since 2011. He is also a Professor Emeritus at the University of Göttingen and a co-chair of the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Göttingen .

==Honors and awards==

* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1991, jointly with Bert Sakmann)
* Fellow of the Royal Society (1994)
* Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience (1991)
* Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize (1987)
* Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (1986)

Neher holds honorary degrees from:

<doc id="762733" wikidata="Q380148" url="?curid=762733" title="Motilal Nehru">
<text>Motilal Nehru (6 May 1861 – 6 February 1931) was an Indian lawyer, activist, and politician affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He served as the Congress President twice, from 1919 to 1920 and from 1928 to 1929. He was a patriarch of the Nehru-Gandhi family and the father of Jawaharlal Nehru, India&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

==Early life and education==
Motilal Nehru was born on 6 May 1861, the posthumous son of Gangadhar Nehru and his wife Indrani. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, Gangadhar Nehru was the kotwal or police officer of Delhi.

Thus, Motilal came to spend his childhood in Khetri, second largest thikana (feudal estate) within the princely state of Jaipur, now in Rajasthan. His elder brother, Nandlal Nehru gained the favour of Raja Fateh Singh of Khetri, who was the same age as him, and rose to the position of Diwan (Chief Minister; effectively the manager) of the vast feudal estate. In 1870, Fateh Singh died childless and was succeeded by a distant cousin, who had little use for his predecessor&#x27;s confidants. Nandlal left Khetri for Agra and found that his prior career at Khetri equipped him to advise litigants regarding their legal suits. Once he realised this, he exhibited his industry and resilience again by studying for and passing the necessary examinations so that he could practice law in the British colonial courts. He then began practising law at the provincial High Court at Agra. Subsequently, the High Court shifted base to Allahabad, and the family moved to that city.

According to Nanda, by their teenage years Motilal and other sons of Gangadhar had learnt to speak English. According to historian Sarvepalli Gopal, Motilal was, like his ancestors, more fluent in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu than in any other Indian language.

==Career==
Motilal passed the bar examination in 1883 and began practicing law at Kanpur. Three years later, he moved to Allahabad to join the lucrative practice already established by his brother Nandlal. The following year, in April 1887, his brother died at the age of forty-two, leaving behind five sons and two daughters. Thus Motilal at the age of 25 became sole bread-earner of the extended Nehru family.
Many of Motilal&#x27;s suits were civil cases concerning large land-owning families. He soon made a name for himself in the civil society of Allahabad. With the success of his practice, in 1900, he bought a large family home in the Civil Lines area of the city, rebuilt it and named it Anand Bhavan (lit. Joy house). In 1909, he reached the pinnacle of his legal career by gaining the approval to appear in the Privy Council of Great Britain. His frequent visits to Europe angered the Kashmiri Brahmin community as he refused to perform the traditional &quot;prayashchit&quot;, or reformation ceremony, after crossing the ocean (according to Strict Hinduism, one lost one&#x27;s caste after crossing the ocean, and was required to perform certain penance rites to regain caste). In 1899, he was expelled from the caste for refusing to perform the penancy ceremony. He was the first chairman of the board of directors of The Leader, a leading daily published from Allahabad.

On 5 February 1919 he launched a new daily paper, &quot;The Independent&quot;, as a counterpoint to &quot;The Leader&quot;, which was much too liberal for Motilal&#x27;s standard and articulate thought in 1919.

He started on the path to become wealthy among the few leaders of the Indian National Congress. Under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi in 1918, Nehru became one of the first to transform his life to exclude western clothes and material goods, adopting a more native Indian lifestyle.

To meet the expenses of his large family and large family homes, Nehru had to occasionally return to his practice of law. Swaraj Bhawan originally belonged to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the 19th century Muslim leader and educationist. At the house-warming party, Sir William Moor hoped that this large palatial home in Civil Lines of Allahabad would become the cement holding together the British Empire in India. Paradoxically, the house was bought by Motilal Nehru in 1900, and went on to become a cradle to the Indian Freedom Struggle which was to destroy British rule in India.

===Political career===
Motilal Nehru twice served as President of the Congress Party, once in Amritsar (1919) and the second time in Calcutta (1928). The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 left a deep impression on him where it has been reported that he wrote in its aftermath: &quot;My blood is boiling&quot;. In December that year, he was elected to preside over the Amritsar Congress. Motilal was in the centre of the gathering storm which pulled down many familiar landmarks during the following year. He was the only front rank leader to lend his support to non-co-operation at the special Congress at Calcutta in September 1920. The Calcutta Congress (December 1928) over which Motilal presided was the scene of a head-on clash between those who were prepared to accept Dominion Status and those who would have nothing short of complete independence. A split was averted by a proposal by Mahatma Gandhi, according to which if Britain did not concede Dominion Status within a year, the Congress was to demand complete independence and to fight for it, if necessary, by launching civil disobedience. He was arrested during the Non-Cooperation Movement. Although initially close to Gandhi, he openly criticised Gandhi&#x27;s suspension of civil resistance in 1922 due to the murder of policemen by a riotous mob in Chauri Chaura in Uttar Pradesh.

Motilal later joined the Swaraj Party, which sought to enter the British-sponsored councils. Motilal had been elected to the United Provinces Legislative Council where he staged the first walk-out in protest of the rejection of a resolution he had moved. In 1923, Nehru was elected to the new Central Legislative Assembly of British India in New Delhi and became leader of the Opposition. In that role, he was able to secure the defeat, or at least the delay, of Finance bills and other legislation. He agreed to join a Committee with the object of promoting the recruitment of Indian officers into the Indian Army, but this decision contributed to others going further and joining the Government itself.

In March 1926, Nehru demanded a representative conference to draft a constitution conferring full Dominion status on India, to be enacted by the British parliament. This demand was rejected by the Assembly, and as a result Nehru and his colleagues resigned their Assembly seats and returned to the Congress party.

The entry of Motilal&#x27;s son Jawaharlal Nehru into politics in 1916, started the most powerful and influential Indian political dynasty. When, in 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru was elected as Congress president it greatly pleased Motilal and Nehru family admirers to see the son take over from his father. Jawaharlal had opposed his father&#x27;s preference for dominion status, and had not left the Congress Party when Motilal helped found the Swaraj Party.

==Nehru report==
Motilal Nehru chaired the famous Nehru Commission in 1928, a counter to the all-British Simon Commission. The Nehru Report, the first constitution written only by Indians, envisioned a dominion status for India within the Empire, akin to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It was endorsed by the Indian National Congress, but rejected by more nationalist Indians who sought complete independence. The report was rejected by the Muslim leadership of India, especially Muhammad Ali Jinnah over concerns that the lack of constitutional safeguards against majoritarianism created unacceptable risks for Indian Muslims.

==Death and legacy==
Motilal Nehru&#x27;s age and declining health kept him out of the historic events of 1929–1931, when the Congress adopted complete independence as its goal and when Gandhi launched the Salt Satyagraha. He was arrested and imprisoned with his son; but his health gave way and he was released. In the last week of January 1931 Gandhi and the Congress Working Committee were released by the Government as a gesture in that chain of events which was to lead to the Gandhi-lrwin Pact. Motilal had the satisfaction of having his son and Gandhi beside him in his last days. On 6 February 1931 he died.

Motilal Nehru is remembered for being the patriarch of India&#x27;s most powerful political dynasty which has since produced three Prime Ministers. Two of his great-great-grandsons, Rahul Gandhi, and Varun Gandhi are members of the lower house of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha and belong to the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party respectively.

<doc id="762734" wikidata="Q1334367" url="?curid=762734" title="Elwha River">
<text>The Elwha River is a river on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. From its source at Elwha snowfinger in the Olympic Mountains, it flows generally north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Most of the river&#x27;s course is within the Olympic National Park.

The Elwha is one of several rivers in the Pacific Northwest that hosts all five species of native Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon), plus four anadromous trout species (steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, bull trout, and Dolly Varden char). From 1911 to 2014, dams blocked fish passage on the lower Elwha River. Before the dams, 400,000 adult salmon returned yearly to spawn in of river habitat. Prior to dam removal, fewer than 4,000 salmon returned each year in only of habitat below the lower dam. The National Park Service removed the two dams as part of the $325 million Elwha Ecosystem Restoration Project. Dam removal work began in September 2011 and was completed in August 2014. The river has already carried sediment to its mouth, creating 70 acres of estuary habitat at the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The first documented use of the name Elwha River dates to Henry Kellett&#x27;s 1846 map.
==Course==

The Elwha River begins at the Elwha snowfinger near Mount Barnes and Mount Queets in the Olympic Range within Olympic National Park, in Jefferson County, Washington. The river flows southeast, then curves northward for the great majority of its course, with its mouth at the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Major peaks near the Elwha&#x27;s source include Mount Queets, Mount Christie, Mount Meany, Mount Noyes, and Mount Seattle.

After receiving the tributaries Delabarre and Godkin creeks, the Elwha River flows northward. The Hayes River joins in Press Valley, where the Hayes River Ranger Station is located. Lost River joins near the northern end of Press Valley, after which the Elwha crosses into Clallam County, Washington.

Just after the county line, the Elwha River passes the Elkhorn Ranger Station and enters the Grand Canyon of the Elwha. As the river leaves the Grand Canyon, it is crossed by Dodger Point Bridge. Humes Ranch Cabin is located near the river along the Geyser Valley trail. After passing Krause Bottom, the river enters Rica Canyon at Goblins Gate. Prior to dam removal, the river fanned out into a delta below Rica Canyon, at the head of Lake Mills, the reservoir behind Glines Canyon Dam. Below the dam site, the Elwha is paralleled by Olympic Hot Springs Road. The river receives a tribunate from the Madison creek. The trailhead for Madison Creek Falls is also along the river. Campgrounds and the Elwha Ranger Station are located along the river before it exits Olympic National Park. Until early 2012, when Lake Aldwell was drained, the river entered this reservoir behind Elwha Dam.

Downriver from the former site of the Elwha Dam, the Elwha River flows several miles north through the Elwha Canyon and the Lower Elwha Indian Reservation, to enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca at Angeles Point, just west of the city of Port Angeles, Washington.

==Dams==

The undamming of the Elwha was, at the time, the largest dam removal project in history. The Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project is the second largest ecosystem restoration project the National Park Service has attempted, after the Everglades. The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992 was signed by the first President Bush after it was passed by Congress. The project was projected to cost $350 million. The act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire and remove the two dams on the river and restore the ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries.

The removal of the tall Elwha Dam and the tall Glines Canyon Dam began in September 2011. Two downstream water treatment facilities were completed in early 2010 to protect the water supply for the city of Port Angeles and the fish hatcheries from silt and sediment that would wash downstream once the dams were removed. In order to protect fish stocks below the dams during removal, the dams were taken out over a three-year period, pausing to ensure there would be no silt in the river while salmon spawned downstream.

The Elwha Dam was completely dismantled in March 2012. Restoration of the area around the dam followed, including tens of thousands of native plants started in local greenhouses. The removal of the Glines Canyon Dam was completed in August 2014.

Salmon will naturally recolonize the of habitat in Olympic National Park. The area once under the reservoirs is being revegetated to prevent erosion and speed up ecological restoration of the area. Because almost all of the Elwha&#x27;s watershed is in a national park, the river should become relatively pristine, with few of the issues of agricultural runoff and water heating that affect other salmon river habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Model projections by the Park Service show that up to 392,000 fish will fill 70 miles of habitat, theoretically matching the &quot;pre-dam peak&quot;.

By late December 2012, about 10 percent of the estimated of sediment that had been caught behind the river&#x27;s two dams had collected at the Elwha&#x27;s mouth, forming sandbars. With the Elwha Dam removed, the sediment had been pushed downstream as heavy rainfall produced faster-moving flows in the free-running river. By November 2014, 30 percent of the stored sediment had been carried to the mouth of the river, creating of new estuary habitat for a wide variety of shellfish and other species.

The mountain was named to honor James Halbold Christie, who was the leader of the Seattle Press Expedition which first explored the unknown interior of the range in 1889–1890. The massif has several peaks, and the large Christie Glacier resides in the north cirque below the main summit.

==Climate==
Mount Christie is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger.

Dungeness Spit is a sand spit jutting out approximately from the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula in northeastern Clallam County, Washington into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It is the longest natural sand spit in the United States. The spit is growing in length by about per year. The body of water it encloses is called Dungeness Bay. 

The Dungeness Spit is entirely within the Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge and home of the New Dungeness Lighthouse. Its land area, according to the United States Census Bureau, is 1,271,454 square meters (0.4909 sq mi, or 314.18 acres). The lighthouse once was run by United States Coast Guard, but in 1976 the agency installed an automatic light. Since 1994 the lighthouse has been staffed and maintained by the volunteer &quot;New Dungeness Light Station Association&quot;. The spit is open to the public year around. The spit has a campground and &quot;Dungeness Recreation Area&quot; that is also open year-round. The campground features a 1-mile long scenic bluff trail, several miles of hiking/biking trails, and a designated equestrian trail. 

The spit was first recorded by Europeans during the Spanish 1790 Quimper expedition. British explorer George Vancouver named the landform in 1792, writing &quot;The low sandy point of land, which from its great resemblance to Dungeness in the British Channel, I called New Dungeness.&quot; He named it after the Dungeness headland in England.

In December 2001 a heavy winter storm forced water over the spit. The next morning the spit was split in three places, and vehicles supplying the lighthouse were not able to traverse the spit for about a month.

<doc id="762748" wikidata="Q1266200" url="?curid=762748" title="Harriet Nelson">
<text>Harriet Nelson (formerly Hilliard; born Peggy Lou Snyder; July 18, 1909 – October 2, 1994) was an American actress. Nelson is best known for her role on the sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Nelson was born Peggy Lou Snyder in Des Moines, Iowa, the daughter of Hazel Dell née McNutt (1888–1971) and Roy Hilliard Snyder (1879–1953). She appeared on the vaudeville stage when she was three years old and made her debut on Broadway in her teens.

She frequented the Cotton Club, began smoking at age thirteen. She wed the comedian, Roy Sedley (1901-1989), in 1930. They were briefly married, but Roy was abusive and lived what has been described as &quot;a high-flying life&quot;. They separated a year later, and the marriage was annulled in 1933. She left high school before graduating and joined the Corps de Ballet at the Capitol Theater, later dancing in the Harry Carroll Revue and working as a straight woman for comedians Ken Murray and Bert Lahr. By 1932, she was still performing in vaudeville when she met the saxophone-playing bandleader Ozzie Nelson. Nelson hired her to sing with the band, under the name Harriet Hilliard. They married three years later.

Hilliard had a respectable film career as a solo performer, apart from the band. RKO Radio Pictures signed her to a one-year contract in 1936, and she appeared in three feature films, the most famous being the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot;. She was very much in demand during the World War II years for leading roles in escapist musicals, comedies, and mysteries.

In Ozzie Nelson&#x27;s book, he wrote that Harriet was quite popular during her short time at RKO, and that he and she wanted her to continue her solo film career. However, they decided it was more important for her to continue with the band and subsequent radio show.
Although the couple occasionally appeared together in movies, either as a duo (in &quot;Honeymoon Lodge&quot;) or as separate characters (in &quot;Hi, Good Lookin&#x27;!&quot;), they are best known for their broadcasting efforts. In 1944, the Nelsons began a domestic-comedy series for radio, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. It was highly popular and made a successful transition to television. It was one of the stalwarts of the ABC-TV schedule from 1952 to 1966. The Nelsons&#x27; two sons, Ricky and David, were featured continuously on the show. Peter Jones, director of the television documentary &quot;Ozzie and Harriet: The Adventures of America&#x27;s Favorite Family,&quot; has described Harriet Nelson: &quot;She was a bombshell. She liked gay people. She liked a good off-color joke. She enjoyed her cocktails at night. She had the talent to go on and be a big star, but she made that decision to be Ozzie&#x27;s wife.&quot;

In 1973, Ozzie and Harriet also appeared in the sitcom &quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls&quot;.

In 2009, Harriet was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1952–1966.

==Personal life==
Harriet (then known as Peggy Lou Snyder) wed the comedian Roy Sedley (1901-1989), in 1930. They were briefly married, but Roy was abusive and lived what has been described as &quot;a high-flying life&quot;. [4] They separated a year later, and the marriage was annulled in 1933. [5] In 1935, she married bandleader Ozzie Nelson. They had two sons, David (born in 1936) and Eric (known as Ricky, born in 1940). The couple remained married until Ozzie&#x27;s death from liver cancer in 1975. Her grandchildren include actress Tracy Nelson and musicians Matthew and Gunnar Nelson. She was also the mother-in-law of Rick&#x27;s wife Kristin Harmon and David&#x27;s wife June Blair.

Nelson and her husband were charter members of the Hollywood Republican Committee.

==Later years and death==
In 1978, Harriet Nelson moved full-time to the Laguna Beach, California, beach home the family had built in 1954. She died of congestive heart failure on October 2, 1994. She is interred with her husband and younger son Ricky (who died in a plane crash in 1985) in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles.

For her contribution to the television industry, Harriet Nelson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.
