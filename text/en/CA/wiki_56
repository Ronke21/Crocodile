<text>The classical rocket equation, or ideal rocket equation is a mathematical equation that describes the motion of vehicles that follow the basic principle of a rocket: a device that can apply acceleration to itself using thrust by expelling part of its mass with high velocity and can thereby move due to the conservation of momentum.
It is credited to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who independently derived it and published it in 1903, although it had been independently derived and published by William Moore in 1810, and later published in a separate book in 1813. Robert Goddard also developed it independently in 1912, and Hermann Oberth derived it independently about 1921.

The maximum change of velocity of the vehicle, formula_1 (with no external forces acting) is:

formula_2
where:
* formula_3 is the effective exhaust velocity;
**formula_4 is the specific impulse in dimension of time;
**formula_5 is standard gravity;
* formula_6 is the natural logarithm function;
* formula_7 is the initial total mass, including propellant, a.k.a. wet mass;
* formula_8 is the final total mass without propellant, a.k.a. dry mass.

Given the effective exhaust velocity determined by the rocket motor&#x27;s design, the desired delta-v (e.g., orbital speed or escape velocity), and a given dry mass formula_8, the equation can be solved for the required wet mass formula_7:
formula_11 The required propellant mass is then formula_12

The necessary wet mass grows exponentially with the desired delta-v.

== History ==
The equation is named after Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky who independently derived it and published it in his 1903 work.

The equation had been derived earlier by the British mathematician William Moore in 1810, and later published in a separate book in 1813.

American Robert Goddard independently developed the equation in 1912 when he began his research to improve rocket engines for possible space flight. German engineer Hermann Oberth independently derived the equation about 1920 as he studied the feasibility of space travel.

While the derivation of the rocket equation is a straightforward calculus exercise, Tsiolkovsky is honored as being the first to apply it to the question of whether rockets could achieve speeds necessary for space travel.

== Experiment of the boat==
In order to understand the principle of rocket propulsion, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky proposed the famous experiment of &quot;the boat&quot;. A person is in a boat away from the shore without oars. They want to reach this shore. They notice that the boat is loaded with a certain quantity of stones and have the idea of quickly and repeatedly throwing the stones in succession in the opposite direction. Effectively, the quantity of movement of the stones thrown in one direction corresponds to an equal quantity of movement for the boat in the other direction (ignoring friction / drag).

==Derivation==
===Most popular derivation===
Consider the following system:

In the following derivation, &quot;the rocket&quot; is taken to mean &quot;the rocket and all of its unexpended propellant&quot;.

Newton&#x27;s second law of motion relates external forces (formula_13) to the change in linear momentum of the whole system (including rocket and exhaust) as follows:
formula_14
where formula_15 is the momentum of the rocket at time formula_16:
formula_17
and formula_18 is the momentum of the rocket and exhausted mass at time formula_19:
formula_20
and where, with respect to the observer:
* formula_21 is the velocity of the rocket at time formula_16
* formula_23 is the velocity of the rocket at time formula_19
* formula_25 is the velocity of the mass added to the exhaust (and lost by the rocket) during time formula_26
* formula_27 is the mass of the rocket at time formula_16
* formula_29 is the mass of the rocket at time formula_19

The velocity of the exhaust formula_25 in the observer frame is related to the velocity of the exhaust in the rocket frame formula_3 by:
formula_33
thus,
formula_34
Solving this yields:
formula_35
If formula_21 and formula_37 are opposite, formula_38 have the same direction as formula_21, formula_40 are negligible (since formula_41), and using formula_42 (since ejecting a positive formula_43 results in a decrease in rocket mass in time),
formula_44

If there are no external forces then formula_45 (conservation of linear momentum) and
formula_46

Assuming that formula_3 is constant (known as Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s hypothesis), so it is not subject to integration, then the above equation may be integrated as follows:
formula_48

This then yields
formula_49
or equivalently
formula_50 or
formula_51 or
formula_52
where formula_7 is the initial total mass including propellant, formula_8 the final mass, and formula_3 the velocity of the rocket exhaust with respect to the rocket (the specific impulse, or, if measured in time, that multiplied by gravity-on-Earth acceleration). If formula_3 is NOT constant, we might not have rocket equations that are as simple as the above forms. Many rocket dynamics researches were based on the Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s constant formula_3 hypothesis.

The value formula_58 is the total working mass of propellant expended.

formula_59 (delta-v) is the integration over time of the magnitude of the acceleration produced by using the rocket engine (what would be the actual acceleration if external forces were absent). In free space, for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity, this is the increase of the speed. In the case of an acceleration in opposite direction (deceleration) it is the decrease of the speed. Of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle, and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle. Hence delta-v may not always be the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle.

===Other derivations===

====Impulse-based====
The equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass.
By representing the delta-v equation as the following:
formula_60

where T is thrust, formula_7 is the initial (wet) mass and formula_43 is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass,

and realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved,
formula_63

The integral is found to be:
formula_64

Realising that impulse over the change in mass is equivalent to force over propellant mass flow rate (p), which is itself equivalent to exhaust velocity,
formula_65
the integral can be equated to
formula_66

====Acceleration-based====
Imagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it (Newton&#x27;s First Law of Motion). From the moment its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket expels gas mass at a &quot;constant mass flow rate R&quot; (kg/s) and at &quot;exhaust velocity relative to the rocket ve&quot; (m/s). This creates a constant force &quot;F&quot; propelling the rocket that is equal to &quot;R&quot; × &quot;ve&quot;. The rocket is subject to a constant force, but its total mass is decreasing steadily because it is expelling gas. According to Newton&#x27;s Second Law of Motion, its acceleration at any time &quot;t&quot; is its propelling force &quot;F&quot; divided by its current mass &quot;m&quot;:
formula_67

Now, the mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to &quot;m&quot;0 – &quot;mf&quot;. For the constant mass flow rate &quot;R&quot; it will therefore take a time &quot;T&quot; = (&quot;m&quot;0 – &quot;mf&quot;)/&quot;R&quot; to burn all this fuel. Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to time from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;T&quot; (and noting that &quot;R = dm/dt&quot; allows a substitution on the right) obtains: 
formula_68

==== Limit of finite mass &quot;pellet&quot; expulsion ====
The rocket equation can also be derived as the limiting case of the speed change for a rocket that expels its fuel in the form of formula_69 pellets consecutively, as formula_70, with an effective exhaust speed formula_71 such that the mechanical energy gained per unit fuel mass is given by formula_72.

In the rocket&#x27;s center-of-mass frame, if a pellet of mass formula_73 is ejected at speed formula_74 and the remaining mass of the rocket is formula_27, the amount of energy converted to increase the rocket&#x27;s and pellet&#x27;s kinetic energy is
formula_76

Using momentum conservation in the rocket&#x27;s frame just prior to ejection, formula_77, from which we find 
formula_78

Let formula_79 be the initial fuel mass fraction on board and formula_80 the initial fueled-up mass of the rocket. Divide the total mass of fuel formula_81 into formula_69 discrete pellets each of mass formula_83. The remaining mass of the rocket after ejecting formula_84 pellets is then formula_85. The overall speed change after ejecting formula_84 pellets is the sum

formula_87

Notice that for large formula_69 the last term in the denominator formula_89 and can be neglected to give
formula_90 where formula_91 and formula_92.

As formula_93 this Riemann sum becomes the definite integral
formula_94 since the final remaining mass of the rocket is formula_95.

===Special relativity===

If special relativity is taken into account, the following equation can be derived for a relativistic rocket, with formula_1 again standing for the rocket&#x27;s final velocity (after expelling all its reaction mass and being reduced to a rest mass of formula_97) in the inertial frame of reference where the rocket started at rest (with the rest mass including fuel being formula_7 initially), and formula_99 standing for the speed of light in vacuum:
formula_100

Writing formula_101 as formula_102 allows this equation to be rearranged as
formula_103

Then, using the identity formula_104 (here &quot;exp&quot; denotes the exponential function; &quot;see also&quot; Natural logarithm as well as the &quot;power&quot; identity at logarithmic identities) and the identity formula_105 (&quot;see&quot; Hyperbolic function), this is equivalent to
formula_106

==Terms of the equation==

===Delta-&quot;v&quot;===

Delta-&quot;v&quot; (literally &quot;change in velocity&quot;), symbolised as Δ&quot;v&quot; and pronounced &quot;delta-vee&quot;, as used in spacecraft flight dynamics, is a measure of the impulse that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launching from, or landing on a planet or moon, or an in-space orbital maneuver. It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is &quot;not&quot; the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle.

Delta-&quot;v&quot; is produced by reaction engines, such as rocket engines, is proportional to the thrust per unit mass and burn time, and is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given manoeuvre through the rocket equation.

For multiple manoeuvres, delta-&quot;v&quot; sums linearly.

For interplanetary missions delta-&quot;v&quot; is often plotted on a porkchop plot which displays the required mission delta-&quot;v&quot; as a function of launch date.

===Mass fraction===

In aerospace engineering, the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle&#x27;s mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle&#x27;s performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design. Another related measure is the payload fraction, which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload.

===Effective exhaust velocity===

The effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a specific impulse and they are related to each other by:
formula_107
where
*formula_4 is the specific impulse in seconds,
*formula_3 is the specific impulse measured in m/s, which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in m/s (or ft/s if g is in ft/s2),
*formula_5 is the standard gravity, 9.80665m/s2 (in Imperial units 32.174ft/s2).

==Applicability==
The rocket equation captures the essentials of rocket flight physics in a single short equation. It also holds true for rocket-like reaction vehicles whenever the effective exhaust velocity is constant, and can be summed or integrated when the effective exhaust velocity varies. The rocket equation only accounts for the reaction force from the rocket engine; it does not include other forces that may act on a rocket, such as aerodynamic or gravitational forces. As such, when using it to calculate the propellant requirement for launch from (or powered descent to) a planet with an atmosphere, the effects of these forces must be included in the delta-V requirement (see Examples below). In what has been called &quot;the tyranny of the rocket equation&quot;, there is a limit to the amount of payload that the rocket can carry, as higher amounts of propellant increment the overall weight, and thus also increase the fuel consumption. The equation does not apply to non-rocket systems such as aerobraking, gun launches, space elevators, launch loops, tether propulsion or light sails.

The rocket equation can be applied to orbital maneuvers in order to determine how much propellant is needed to change to a particular new orbit, or to find the new orbit as the result of a particular propellant burn. When applying to orbital maneuvers, one assumes an impulsive maneuver, in which the propellant is discharged and delta-v applied instantaneously. This assumption is relatively accurate for short-duration burns such as for mid-course corrections and orbital insertion maneuvers. As the burn duration increases, the result is less accurate due to the effect of gravity on the vehicle over the duration of the maneuver. For low-thrust, long duration propulsion, such as electric propulsion, more complicated analysis based on the propagation of the spacecraft&#x27;s state vector and the integration of thrust are used to predict orbital motion.

==Examples==
Assume an exhaust velocity of and a formula_1 of (Earth to LEO, including formula_1 to overcome gravity and aerodynamic drag).

*Single-stage-to-orbit rocket: formula_113 = 0.884, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload.
*Two-stage-to-orbit: suppose that the first stage should provide a formula_1 of ; formula_115 = 0.671, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a formula_1 of ; formula_117 = 0.648, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2% of the original total mass, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% of the original launch mass is available for &quot;all&quot; engines, the tanks, and payload.

==Stages==
In the case of sequentially thrusting rocket stages, the equation applies for each stage, where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage, and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned. For each stage the specific impulse may be different.

For example, if 80% of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage, and 10% is the dry mass of the first stage, and 10% is the remaining rocket, then

formula_118

With three similar, subsequently smaller stages with the same formula_3 for each stage, gives:

formula_120

and the payload is 10% × 10% × 10% = 0.1% of the initial mass.

A comparable SSTO rocket, also with a 0.1% payload, could have a mass of 11.1% for fuel tanks and engines, and 88.8% for fuel. This would give

formula_121

If the motor of a new stage is ignited before the previous stage has been discarded and the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse (as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fuel stage), the situation is more complicated.

The label&#x27;s all-electronic format closely tracked with European contemporaries, such as Off Beat, and since 1995 has been instrumental in promoting and distributing underground electronic music in America.

On June 9, 1999, Metropolis bought the American industrial label, Pendragon Records. It assumed distribution responsibilities for Pendragon&#x27;s back catalogue, as well as that of 21st Circuitry, another industrial label that had gone out of business.

<text>Vincent Terrell Jackson (January 14, 1983 – February 15, 2021) was an American professional football wide receiver who played for 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Northern Colorado Bears, and was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the second round of the 2005 NFL draft. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Jackson was selected to the Pro Bowl three times and exceeded 1,000 receiving yards six times in his career. Jackson died in 2021, with the official cause of his death reported as chronic alcohol abuse. An autopsy found Stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy in his brain.

== Early life ==
Jackson attended Widefield High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a senior, he was a &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; All-State Honorable Mention, a first-team all-area pick, and a first-team all-conference pick. He also was a standout in basketball. A straight-A student in high school, Jackson was accepted to Columbia, but decided to attend University of Northern Colorado on a partial scholarship to play both basketball and football.

== College career ==
Jackson enrolled at the University of Northern Colorado and played for the Northern Colorado Bears football team from 2001 to 2004 UNC was one of the few colleges that recruited Jackson out of high school. One of the few true freshmen to ever play for Northern Colorado, Jackson earned All-American honors as a punt returner, scoring the first time he ever touched a ball on a punt return against Adams State College. He became Northern Colorado&#x27;s all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards (game &amp; season), kick return yards, punt return yards, and receiving touchdowns. His senior season was highlighted by a 13-catch, 249-yard, three-touchdown effort against Florida Atlantic. Jackson is the all-time career record holder in receiving yards and yards per catch among various other, game, season, and career records. 
Jackson also started for Northern Colorado in basketball, playing for two seasons at UNC and leading the team in scoring both years.

== Professional career ==
=== San Diego Chargers ===
==== 2005 season ====

Jackson was selected in the second round (61st overall) of the 2005 NFL draft (the highest ever by a Northern Colorado graduate) by the San Diego Chargers.

Jackson got off to a slow start in 2005 due to injuries. He was inactive for the first five games of the season and finally saw his first NFL action in an October 16 game against the Oakland Raiders. Jackson caught his first pass on November 6 against the New York Jets, but he would only catch two more passes for the rest of the season.

==== 2006 season ====
Jackson caught his first NFL touchdown on September 17, 2006, in a victory over the Tennessee Titans. In the Chargers&#x27; Christmas Eve game against the Seattle Seahawks, Jackson had a memorable touchdown catch that led the Chargers to victory. With 29 seconds left, quarterback Philip Rivers threw a touchdown pass to Jackson and the Chargers ended up winning the game 20–17 and setting a franchise record for wins. Jackson ended the season strongly and finished second on the team with six touchdown catches.

In a 2006 game against the Oakland Raiders, Jackson nearly made one of the most bizarre turnovers in recent NFL history. After making a 13-yard catch on fourth down, Jackson immediately got up and spun the ball forward in celebration. Because Jackson had fallen on his own and was not tackled, Raiders cornerback Fabian Washington believed it to be a fumble and leapt upon the ball. Possession was originally awarded to Oakland, but the Chargers were then flagged for an illegal forward pass and allowed to keep the ball.

==== 2007 season ====
By virtue of the release of Keenan McCardell and an injury to Eric Parker, Jackson entered the 2007 season as a starting wide receiver for the Chargers. He started the season in an unmemorable fashion in a home game against the Chicago Bears by dropping a sure touchdown that bounced off his chest in the end zone. However, by the end of the season, Jackson had distinguished himself as a top target for Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers.

==== 2008 season ====
In the 2008 season, Jackson had a career season with 59 receptions, seven touchdowns, and 1,098 yards. He became the first Chargers wide receiver to have 1,000 yards receiving since 2001.

==== 2009 season ====

Jackson followed his strongest season as a pro with an even stronger one during the 2009 season, when he finished with 68 receptions, and led the team in receiving with nine touchdowns and 1,167 yards. During a January 17, 2010, divisional playoff game against the New York Jets, Jackson made a 37-yard catch that was challenged by Jets head coach Rex Ryan. Jackson received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for kicking the challenge flag, which cost the Chargers 15 yards (the play was upheld). Jackson would finish the game with seven receptions for 111 yards, becoming the first receiver of the 2009 NFL season to record a 100-yard game on the Jets All-Pro cornerback and future Buccaneer teammate Darrelle Revis.

==== 2010 season ====
On March 2, 2010, Jackson faced arraignment for driving with a suspended license. He was handcuffed briefly and had his car impounded following a traffic stop just a few hours before the Chargers&#x27; playoff loss to the New York Jets. Jackson was pulled over for playing loud music. He was cited for driving with a suspended license and expired tags.

Jackson was selected to his first Pro Bowl during the 2009 NFL season as an alternate. Jackson had a strong showing in his first Pro Bowl appearance, racking up seven receptions for 122 yards, including a 48-yard catch and run for a touchdown.

On July 1, 2010, it was announced that Jackson had been suspended for three games for violating the league&#x27;s personal conduct policy.

Following a contract dispute, Jackson returned in week 11 of the 2010 NFL season after holding out the first 10 games. In week 15 against the San Francisco 49ers, Jackson had a career-high three touchdowns and 112 yards en route to a 34–7 win. He finished the season with 14 receptions and 248 yards.

==== 2011 season ====
On February 15, 2011, the Chargers placed their franchise tag on Jackson.

During the labor dispute between league owners and players following the end of the 2010 season, a lockout occurred from March 11 to July 25. Jackson was one of the 10 plaintiffs in the Brady antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, which included star players such as Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, and fellow 2010 holdout Logan Mankins. Initially, Adam Schefter of ESPN reported that Vincent Jackson wanted compensation in the form of $10 million or to become an unrestricted free agent when the lockout was over. Jackson denied reports that he had asked for compensation, but on July 23 Jackson released his claim in the Brady v. NFL lawsuit. Jackson&#x27;s decision to drop his alleged request of unrestricted free agency and/or monetary compensation helped expedite the completion of the new labor deal. Jackson&#x27;s Franchise Tag was held up under the new NFL CBA.

On July 29, 2011, the first day teams were permitted to sign non-rookie free agents, Jackson signed his one-year Franchise offer, thus remaining a Charger. Because of his contract holdout during the 2010 NFL season, Jackson received only $583,000 in compensation for playing in the final six games of the season. For the 2011 season, under the franchise tag, Jackson received approximately $11.4 million, almost 20 times more than in the previous season. In week nine, Jackson played a personal best of 141 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers. He finished the season with totals of 60 catches for 1,106 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl as an alternate for Wes Welker.

==== Contract dispute ====
When the NFL&#x27;s Collective Bargaining Agreement expired, Jackson became a Restricted Free Agent for an additional year, causing the Chargers to place a one-year, $3.2 million tender on him. Seeking a long-term deal instead, Jackson held out of training camp. On June 15, 2010, the Chargers cut his tender to $583,000 for holding out, 110% of his salary for the 2009 NFL season.

On August 20, 2010, the Chargers placed him on the Roster Exempt List, meaning that he would have to serve a three-game suspension once he had agreed to a contract. The National Football League Players Association arranged a deal in which, if Jackson was traded by the Chargers by 4 PM on September 22, he would have instead been placed on the Commissioner Exempt List, rolling six games of suspensions (three for pleading guilty to drunk driving and three for being placed on the roster exempt list) into four. No deal materialized. The agreement also stipulated that he could be traded two days before the NFL trade deadline, but once again no deal materialized in that time. On October 29, 2010, Jackson ended his hold-out and signed the one-year tender. The deadline to sign and accrue a full season, so that he would be an unrestricted free agent in 2011, was October 30, 2010.

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===
==== 2012 season ====
On March 13, 2012, Jackson signed a five-year, $55.55 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On September 7, 2012, Jackson was elected a team captain.
On October 21 against the New Orleans Saints, Jackson set multiple Buccaneer records, with the longest reception and longest play from scrimmage in Tampa Bay history (95 yards) and the most receiving yards in a single game (216 yards). Jackson was selected to his third Pro Bowl to replace the injured Calvin Johnson.

Jackson finished the 2012 season with career-highs in receptions (72) and receiving yards (1,384).

==== 2013 season ====
On September 5, 2013, Jackson was selected as one of the 2013 team captains.
On October 13, 2013, in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Jackson caught his first touchdown since December 2012. He finished the day with nine catches for 114 yards and two touchdowns. The next week, against the Atlanta Falcons, Jackson again had multiple touchdowns while eclipsing the 100 yard mark. At the conclusion of a 4–12 season, Jackson proved to be one of the few bright spots on a football team in disarray, compiling 78 catches for 1,224 yards and seven touchdowns.

==== 2014 season ====
The 2014 season saw declines in Jackson&#x27;s catches and yards due to the emergence of rookie wide receiver Mike Evans. Jackson also was the center of trade rumors before the trade deadline but was ultimately not traded. He finished the 2014 season with over 1,000 yards for the sixth time in his career. He and fellow receiver Mike Evans became the first Buccaneer duo to ever catch for over 1,000 yards. In week 12, Jackson surpassed 8,000 career receiving yards in a game against the Chicago Bears.

==== 2015 season ====
With the arrival of rookie quarterback Jameis Winston and new offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter, Jackson&#x27;s numbers saw further decline during the 2015 season, during which injuries and inconsistent play resulted in Jackson&#x27;s fewest catches (33), yards (543), and touchdowns (3) since coming to Tampa. On December 30, 2015, Jackson was placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

==== 2016 season ====
On October 18, 2016, Jackson was placed on injured reserve after suffering a knee injury in Week 5 in a win against the Carolina Panthers.

===Retirement===
Jackson announced his retirement on May 17, 2018.

==NFL career statistics==
===Buccaneers franchise records===
Jackson set Buccaneers records for receiving yards in a single game (216) and the longest single reception (95 yards) during Tampa Bay&#x27;s October 21, 2012, game against the New Orleans Saints.

== Personal life ==

Both of Jackson&#x27;s parents served in the United States Armed Forces. He sponsored military families at every Buccaneers home game through the &#x27;Jackson in Action&#x27; Front Row Fans section at Raymond James Stadium.

In November 2012, Jackson spoke to students at Northwest Elementary about the importance of physical fitness, helped present a $10,000 Play 60 grant, and led students through a physical education class to congratulate the winners of the Play 60 Super School contest.

In 2016, Jackson graduated from the University of South Florida with a degree in Business Management.

==Death==
On February 15, 2021, Jackson was found dead by a housekeeper in a room at Homewood Suites near Brandon, Florida. There were no apparent signs of trauma. On February 17, the sheriff of Hillsborough County announced that Jackson&#x27;s family said he may have suffered from chronic alcoholism, which contributed to his death. He also stated that they believed he suffered from the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only be confirmed after death from a biopsy of the brain. The family responded that the sheriff did not speak on their behalf. They donated Jackson&#x27;s brain to the Boston University CTE Center. His body was cremated after his family held a private funeral service.

Jackson&#x27;s family confirmed on December 16, 2021, that researchers had discovered Stage 2 CTE in his brain. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease. On December 22, the Hillsborough County Florida Medical Examiner concluded that official cause of Jackson&#x27;s death was chronic alcohol use.

<doc id="772530" wikidata="Q8013394" url="?curid=772530" title="William Jackson (Australian soldier)">
<text>John William Alexander Jackson, VC (13 September 1897 – 4 August 1959) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Jackson was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1916 for selfless courage under heavy fire while rescuing his comrades near Armentières in France during the First World War. Jackson is the youngest Australian to have been awarded a Victoria Cross. His was the first VC to be won by an Australian on the Western Front.

==Early life==
John William Alexander Jackson was born on 13 September 1897 on &quot;Glengower&quot; station, near Gunbar. Known as William or Bill, he was the fourth child of John Gale Jackson and Adelaide Ann (&quot;née&quot; McFarlane). His mother died in 1905 and the six surviving children were raised by her parents at &quot;Seaton Park&quot; (a district property). William and his siblings attended the Gunbar School and William later found employment on local properties.

==First World War==
On 15 February 1915, Jackson enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in the first group of volunteers from Gunbar. In order to do so, with his father&#x27;s approval, Jackson had raised his age by one year.

Placed in the 17th Battalion (5th Infantry Brigade) Jackson embarked for Egypt in May 1915 for initial training. On 20 August he was landed at Gallipoli and fought at Kaiakij Aghala (Hill 60). Six weeks later Jackson was hospitalised with severe dysentery. He recovered in a military hospital in Cairo and on 15 February 1916 rejoined his battalion only days before it embarked for France as part of the 2nd Division.

On 10 April Jackson&#x27;s Division took over a forward position in the eastern Amentieres section of the Western Front. As a prelude to what became known as the Battle of the Somme, orders were issued for raids to be carried out on enemy positions between 20 and 30 June 1916.

On the night of 25 June, Jackson was acting as a scout for a party of forty soldiers, as they carried out an assault on the forward trenches of a Prussian infantry regiment, south-east of Bois Grenier (near Armentières). During the assault Jackson captured an enemy soldier and returned with him through no man&#x27;s land. Prisoners were valued for the purpose of interrogation. On learning that some of his party had been hit in the intense shelling and gun-fire, Jackson returned to no man&#x27;s land. He helped to bring in a wounded man, before going out again. While assisting Sergeant Camden to bring in the seriously wounded Private Robinson, a shell exploded nearby. The blast rendered Camden unconscious, blew off Jackson&#x27;s right arm above the elbow and inflicted further wounds to Robinson.

Despite the loss of his arm, Jackson managed to return to his trenches, claiming he only felt &quot;a numbing sensation&quot;. An officer applied a tourniquet to his arm, using a piece of string and a stick, and Jackson returned to no man&#x27;s land for another half an hour until he was satisfied there were no wounded men left on the battlefield.

The hospital ship &quot;St. Patrick&quot; took Jackson from Boulogne to England where the remainder of his right arm was amputated. While recovering in an Australian military hospital near London, it was announced that Jackson had been awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) &quot;for his great coolness and most conspicuous bravery while rescuing his wounded comrades while under heavy enemy fire&quot;. Approval of Jackson&#x27;s VC was gazetted on 8 September 1916, five days prior to his nineteenth birthday.

Two weeks later, approval was gazetted of the award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) to Private Jackson and to Sergeant Camden for their part in the rescue of wounded soldiers that night.

==Return to Australia==
Jackson left England with a large group of repatriated servicemen aboard the &quot;Themistocles&quot;, and arrived in Sydney on 5 July 1917. At a reception in Sydney for the returned soldiers, held at the Anzac Buffet in the Domain, Jackson was hoisted shoulder-high and singled out for great honour. Accounts suggest that Jackson&#x27;s private and reticent nature left him ill-prepared for the attention and adulation he received on his return to Australia.

Shortly afterwards Jackson travelled by train to Hay, accompanied by his comrade Sergeant Camden. They were met at the railway station by a large crowd who rushed &quot;to get a sight of Private Jackson, and cheer after cheer was given for the returned hero&quot;. The two soldiers were officially welcomed in front of the Post Office. The Deputy Mayor spoke of Hay&#x27;s reflected glory when reports stated that Jackson was from &quot;Gunbar, near Hay&quot;. Camden replied on Jackson&#x27;s behalf, and spoke of his comrade&#x27;s selfless courage: &quot;Bill was not looking for a VC that night, he was looking for a cobber&quot;. That evening Jackson and Sergeant Camden dined with local dignitaries at Tattersall&#x27;s Hotel, on a table covered with the Union Jack and table-napkins folded in the form of military tents.

Gunbar had been experiencing hard times. A period of close settlement in the last decades of the previous century had ended, due to drought and the realities of farming marginal land. Businesses had closed and many of the original selectors and their descendants had left the district and the trend was towards larger holdings and fewer people. Despite this, Jackson was met with great celebration and pride on his return. The residents sought to show their appreciation of Jackson by buying him a farming property in the area, but he declined their offer, believing the loss of his arm rendered him incapable of work on the land.

Several years after Jackson&#x27;s discharge in September 1917 the Army advised his father, John Jackson, that his son&#x27;s DCM had been cancelled. In trying to rectify what seems to be a bureaucratic error the AIF asked John Jackson to return the official DCM award notification he had been sent. John Jackson claimed it was no longer in his possession. By this stage Jackson was living in Kensington, Sydney, close to members of his father&#x27;s family.

==Later life==
In the early 1920s Jackson moved to Merriwa in the New England area, where he became a dealer in skins. In 1927 he became the licensee of the Figtree Hotel near Wollongong for eighteen months. During the Depression years Jackson had several jobs, including managing a green-grocery business and working as a clerk in Sydney. William Jackson married Ivy Morris, a dressmaker, in January 1932 at Kogarah. They had one child, a daughter named Dorothea.

After enlisting during the Second World War Jackson was interrogated in December 1941 regarding his right to wear a DCM ribbon. He denied any knowledge that the award had been cancelled and replied that he would continue to wear all his medals. Jackson requested a discharge and indicated he would prefer to let the matter be decided in Court. The Army seems to have relented, probably on advice from the War Office in London, because Jackson re-enlisted less than three weeks after his discharge on 30 March 1942. He served as corporal in the 2nd Australian Labour Company until September 1942.

After 1946 Jackson again worked as a dealer in skins. He moved to Melbourne in 1953 and was appointed as a Commissionaire and Inquiry Attendant at the Melbourne Town Hall. In August 1953, at a civic reception for Sir William Slim, the Governor-General of Australia, the guest of honour noticed his lift-driver was wearing a VC ribbon, and spoke at length to Jackson, despite the waiting civic dignitaries.

During the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia, Jackson was given several honoured roles. In 1956 Jackson sailed to England for the Victoria Cross Centenary Celebrations. He became extremely ill on the voyage and spent six weeks in hospital, before being flown home.

Jackson continued as an employee of the Melbourne City Council until his death. Jackson died of heart disease on 5 August 1959 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg. He was cremated at Springvale Cemetery with full military honours and his ashes placed in the Boronia Gardens.

On 28 May 2008, the Victoria Cross and campaign medals awarded to Private William Jackson, were sold privately to an Australian collector, whose identity has not been revealed. The price paid for the VC group is thought to be around A$650,000.

<text>William Harding Jackson (March 25, 1901 – September 28, 1971) was a U.S. civilian administrator, New York lawyer, and investment banker who served as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Jackson also served briefly under President Dwight D. Eisenhower as Acting United States National Security Advisor from 1956 to 1957.

==Early life==
William Harding Jackson was born on March 25, 1901, on the Belle Meade Plantation, in Belle Meade, Tennessee, near Nashville, Tennessee. He was named after his father William Harding Jackson (1874–1903), who died when he was two years old. His mother was Anne Davis Richardson (1877–1954). (After her husband&#x27;s death, she married Maxwell Stevenson of Hempstead, New York).

Jackson attended the Fay School in Boston and St. Mark&#x27;s School, an Episcopal Preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. He received his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from Princeton University (1924) and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1928).

==Career==
In 1928, Jackson joined the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. In 1929 he became an Associate of Beekman, Bogue &amp; Clark. Following the stock market crash of 1929, Jackson moved to the business and financial interest law firm of Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn, where he became a full partner in 1934.
During World War II, Jackson served in the United States Army (6 March 1942 – 7 July 1945) as an intelligence officer, graduating from the Army-Air Force (USAAF) Air Combat Intelligence School at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was assigned as an A-2 Assistant Intelligence officer, HQ 1st Bomber Command at 90 Church Street in New York (close to his law office), which immediately became the USAAF Anti-Submarine Command. Jackson was the principal author (along with investment banker Alexander Standish and Harold B. Ingersoll) of the USAAF Bay of Biscay Intelligence Estimate, calling for the attack on Nazi U-boats at their source on the coast of France. This was a significant turning point for the Battle of the Atlantic. 

After graduation from Harrisburg in June 1942, Jackson was promoted to Major and brought into the War Department by Secretary Henry L. Stimson, where he became General Staff (Chief of Secret Intelligence reporting to General George C. Marshall from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at COSSAC headquarters) with the cover title Chief of G-2 intelligence for First Army Group (FUSAG). After training on the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park, UK, he became the senior ULTRA Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) team leader for all US armies in the ETO.

Jackson achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assigned by Gen. Hap Arnold to the planning staff of Brig. Gen. Harold George, who had just taken over the USAAF Air Transport Command (ATC). He was listed as the Adjutant General for the ATC European Wing that ferried more than 7,000 U.S. aircraft to Britain during WW II. He received recognition for work rebuilding or expanding air fields in the United Kingdom for American aircraft and creating an expanded communications network for top secret secured communications (again, with Standish and Ingersoll). By summer of 1943, he was given the &#x27;cover title&#x27; Assistant Attache for Air, stationed at the US Embassy under Ambassador Gil Winant near Grosvenor Square, next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Shortly thereafter he was promoted to full colonel and appointed G-2 intelligence chief at FUSAG headquarters in London&#x27;s West End to work on Operation Bodyguard, the massive deception plan to make the Nazis believe the D-Day assault (Operation Overlord) would come from Scandinavia in the north and at Pas-de-Calais under the command of Gen. George S. Patton, at the narrowest point of the English Channel. He worked closely with Gen. T. J. Betts, Deputy G-2 Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and then Colonel Edwin L. Sibert (G-2) at Headquarters, 1st Army located in Bristol.

After the successful D-Day feint, Jackson was made head of all OSS X-2 Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) in the ETO, traveling with Twelfth Army Group&#x27;s forward EAGLE TAC headquarters to Luxembourg on General Omar Bradley&#x27;s staff. During the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; in Dec-Jan 1945 (in addition to his duties with ULTRA and SCIU teams), on January 1, 1945, during the middle of heated battle, Jackson was named Deputy G-2 for all U.S. armies at Twelfth Army Group.

Decorations—For service to his country and the people of Europe, Jackson was awarded the &quot;Bronze Star Medal,&quot; the &quot;Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster (OLC)&quot;, and the Belgian &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot;. He is believed to be the only US Army officer below the rank of general to receive both the French &quot;Legion of Honor&quot; and &quot;Croix de Guerre with Palm&quot;.
Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI5, MI6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. On November 14, 1945, at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan&#x27;s plan.

After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn to become an investment banker and the &#x27;Managing Partner&#x27; (1947–1955) for J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. of New York.

In 1948, George F. Kennan proposed that control over the government&#x27;s directorate for political warfare should be &quot;answerable&quot; to the Secretary of State, suggesting that &quot;one man must be boss;&quot; and suggesting further, that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Agency should get &quot;out of the business of covert psychological operations&quot;. Kennan took the discussion to Allen W. Dulles, then in private law practice in New York, thinking Dulles would be the logical choice to head the new agency at State. Some believe this started an inter-agency squabble over just who would control intelligence among the military-industrial and civilian intelligence complex. National Security Council (NSC) executive director, Adm. Sidney Souers, appointed Jackson on February 13 to serve on the NSC&#x27;s Intelligence Survey Group with Allen Dulles and Mathias Correa (an aide to then Sec. of Defense James Forrestal) for the purpose of analyzing departmental practices and inter-agency coordination. The Survey Group, known as the &quot;Dulles, Jackson, Correa Committee&quot; or &quot;Dulles Group&quot;, submitted its final report on February 28, 1949. It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which resulted in the removal of several key persons at CIA and, eventually, the removal of Hillenkoetter.

On July 18, 1950, the new Secretary of Defense, Louis Johnson, and General Omar Bradley sent a letter to President Truman nominating William Harding Jackson for Director of Central Intelligence to replace Hillenkoetter. Having known of Jackson&#x27;s background, Truman added a short note to the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying &quot;...&quot;Don: Let&#x27;s look into this. Tell Mr.&quot; [Averell] &quot;Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we&#x27;ll forget Gen. Smith.&quot;&quot;
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.

Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under Walter Bedell Smith (DCI), former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General. Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the &quot;Dulles Report&quot; and NSC-50, and Jackson&#x27;s resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the &#x27;White House Staff&#x27; publication and by the CIA as being a &#x27;Special Adviser&#x27; and &#x27;Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence&#x27; (from 1951–1955).

In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower&#x27;s Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the &quot;Jackson Committee&quot; (1953–1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). While employed as managing director at J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., Jackson was named &#x27;Special Assistant to the Secretary of State&#x27; John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 &quot;Big Four&quot; talks in Geneva. In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower for psychological warfare. He succeeded Nelson Rockefeller who had resigned in December. On 1 March Jackson was appointed by Eisenhower as Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Affairs to &quot;assist in the coordination and timing of the execution of foreign policies involving more than one department or agency. He will represent the President on the Operations Coordinating Board (as Vice Chairman) and will attende meetings of the Cabinet and the National Security Council.&quot; President Eisenhower appointed Jackson to additional responsibilities serving as Acting United States National Security Advisor from September 1, 1956, until January 7, 1957.

==Personal life==
Jackson&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.

At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940–1949) on the board of directors of &quot;The Society of the New York Hospital&quot;, one of America&#x27;s oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences. After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.

In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former President of the Wabash Railroad. They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.
==Death==
Jackson died on September 28, 1971, in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 70.

<text>Providence Park (formerly Jeld-Wen Field; PGE Park; Civic Stadium; originally Multnomah Stadium; and from 1893 until the stadium was built, Multnomah Field) is an outdoor soccer venue located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It is the home of the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer (MLS) and Portland Thorns FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). Providence Park is currently the oldest facility to be configured as a soccer-specific stadium for use by an MLS team, and is one of the most historic grounds used by any United States professional soccer team. It has existed in rudimentary form since 1893, and as a complete stadium since 1926.

Providence Park has been the home of the Timbers since 1975. The stadium has been host to several major United States soccer events including U.S. national team matches, Soccer Bowl &#x27;77, the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 2014 MLS All-Star Game, the 2015 NWSL Championship Game, and MLS Cup 2021.

The Portland-based Multnomah Athletic Club was founded in 1891 and soon constructed the stadium for their amateur sports teams beginning in 1893. In 1926, the facility was expanded into a complete stadium, including the upper seating bowl and the wooden benches which can still be found in the park. In 1956, the stadium was renovated in earnest for the first time to reflect its growing usage in the community. In 1966 the City of Portland purchased the park and renamed it Civic Stadium.

It was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Timbers and the Portland Beavers, while the naming rights of the stadium were purchased by Portland General Electric and it was renamed PGE Park. In 2011, the park underwent renovations again, this time so it could accommodate the Portland Timbers MLS franchise and a year later the stadium name rights were sold, this time to Jeld-Wen (Jeld-Wen Field). In 2014, the name was changed again to Providence Park after Providence Health &amp; Services bought the naming rights.

A 2019 expansion raised the capacity to 25,218 and added a multi-level facade to the East End. The Portland Timbers have sold out every game at Providence Park since moving to MLS in 2011, and the Thorns set a single-game National Women&#x27;s Soccer League attendance record in August 2019 with a sell-out crowd of the same capacity. In 2019, both clubs ranked among the top ten in attendance among professional soccer teams (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s) in the United States and Canada.

==Description==
Providence Park is an outdoor soccer stadium which houses the MLS Portland Timbers and NWSL Portland Thorns. The stadium is owned by the City of Portland, and is managed by Peregrine Sports, LLC, the entity that owns the Timbers and Thorns.

The stadium sits on a rectangular block bounded by Southwest Morrison Street, Southwest 18th Avenue, the Multnomah Athletic Club building and Southwest Salmon Street, and Southwest 20th Avenue.

The Multnomah Athletic Club (MAC), an athletic club in downtown Portland which originally constructed the venue, stands next door; the windows of the north side of the club&#x27;s building overlook the field.

The Interstate 405 freeway in Portland is also known locally as the Stadium Freeway and travels near the stadium. In addition, the Providence Park MAX Light Rail station is across the street. The property slopes significantly downhill from the south end to the north end, with the result that the playing surface sits well below street level. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.

==History==

Since 1893, the site had been home to Multnomah Field, which consisted of sports fields with various grandstands. Before the MAC developed the site as an athletic field, it was a large Chinese vegetable garden, supplying produce to much of Portland. In 1912, the distinctive Multnomah Athletic Club, which currently borders the south end of the stadium, was constructed. The overarching stadium was completed in 1926 for $502,000, and named &quot;Multnomah Civic Stadium&quot; after the club.

The site was used for college football (including seven Civil War games between the University of Oregon and Oregon State University), cricket matches and greyhound racing. Well into the 1960s, most significant football games hosted by Oregon and Oregon State were held at this site because of its capacity. Oregon played in 107 games at Multnomah/Civic Stadium between 1894 and 1970. The University of Washington played all its road games against Oregon and Oregon State at Multnomah Field/Multnomah Stadium between 1923 (OSU) and 1924 (Oregon) until 1966 (OSU) and 1967 (Oregon). The site also hosted the Portland Rose Festival.

In 1956, the Portland Beavers moved to the stadium after their original field, Vaughn Street Park, was condemned. After two attempts for a new domed stadium in Delta Park were defeated by voters in 1964, the city looked to purchase what was already in existence. In 1966, the Multnomah Athletic Club sold the stadium for $2.1 million to the city of Portland, which renamed it &quot;Civic Stadium&quot;. The city government rejected several proposed renovation plans, including construction of a 57,000-seat domed stadium, and adding a second deck supported by helium-filled balloons. Prior to the 2011 MLS season, the stadium was renamed &quot;Jeld-Wen Field&quot; from &quot;PGE Park&quot;, in a partnership with Klamath Falls-based company Jeld-Wen. Jeld-Wen is a manufacturer of windows and doors, leading to the stadium&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The House of Pane.&quot; In 2014, the stadium was renamed &quot;Providence Park&quot; after a partnership with Providence Health &amp; Services was announced.

Kerry Tymchuk, executive director of the Oregon Historical Society, summarized the stadium&#x27;s history: &quot;Providence Park has been home to some of the most iconic moments in Oregon sports history. It also ranks with such classic venues as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park as a stadium that has stood the test of time and that is uniquely part and parcel of the city in which it resides. ... Portland is a city that prides itself on its uniqueness. While many major cities have chosen to replace historic sports stadiums with modern domes or complexes, Portland has chosen to retain much of the original architecture and charm of one of architect A.E. Doyle&#x27;s most beloved creations.&quot;

===Renovations===

====1956====

The first major renovation to Providence Park after its full construction in 1926 came in 1956, when the Portland Beavers moved to what was then called &quot;Multnomah Stadium&quot;, from the dilapidated cross-town Vaughn Street Park. For the first time, permanent East End seating was constructed, as well as a large ticketed section in the southeast corner of the stadium. The East End seats were all constructed above an outfield wall, and box seats were built in the stadium for the first time. Along with the expansion came the demolition of the greyhound racing track, which was constructed in 1933.

====1982====
In November 1980, Portland voters passed a ballot measure that provided the city (who had owned the stadium since 1966) with a much-needed $9.5 million to improve the foundation, concourse and replace the roof. The money allowed the city to replace the aging roof, adding an extended roofline out of laminated Oregon timber. The new roof covered a much higher percentage of seats and included the construction of a new press box, which was finished by winter 1982.

====2001====
In November 2000, the Portland City Council authorized bonds to finance a renovation of then-Civic Stadium. A $38.5 million renovation took place in 2001, upgrading the seating and concourse area, and adding new luxury suites and club seats. The renovation improved the structural soundness of the facility by adding over 750 tons of steel, and introduced a new sound system. The renovation also included some retro-features, such as a manually operated scoreboard. At that point, PGE bought the naming rights and it became &quot;PGE Park&quot;.

The 2001 renovation also removed the remaining seats along 18th Avenue and added in the first electronic video board in the park, modernizing the park for soccer and minor-league baseball. The stadium was temporarily expanded for the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup with bleachers along the east and south ends to bring soccer capacity from 19,556 to over 28,000. A grass surface was also installed for the tournament over the existing NeXturf artificial surface.

====2011====

In July 2009, after attempts to both find a new home for an MLS franchise and identify a site for a new home for the Portland Beavers, the Portland City Council approved a $31 million renovation to make PGE Park ready for the 2011 Major League Soccer season, by reconfiguring the stadium primarily for soccer and football. The decision led to the departure of the Beavers.

A presentation to the Portland Design Commission indicated that 5,000 seats would be added, bringing capacity to about 22,000, but with only about 18,000 available for use on a regular basis.

The renovation met Major League Soccer standards, introduced a new playing surface, which shifted west and north, and added space on the east and south sides, with new seating areas and new amenities. The Lighthouse Impact 16 main video screen was designed by Anthony James Partners and features over of LED video. A Lighthouse B10 pitchside display runs the length of the East End and portions of the north and south ends and is over long. As the project was nearing completion, it was revealed to be $5 million over budget, making the total cost of the renovation $36 million. The agreement between the city and Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson meant that Paulson was responsible for any cost overruns larger than $1 million.

The newly renovated stadium made its début on April 14, 2011, when Major League Soccer&#x27;s Timbers defeated the Chicago Fire, 4–2. The announced attendance at Timbers games in 2011 was 18,627, a sell-out.

A few thousand seats were added for two games late in the 2011 season to bring the capacity to 20,323. About 2,000 seats were opened up for the 2012 season, bringing capacity up to 20,438. Following the 2012 season in which the Timbers&#x27; average attendance was 20,438, during the 2012–13 off-season the Timbers widened the pitch for the 2013 season, adding on each side to achieve a width of . The team widened the pitch by another yard in 2014, for a total pitch size of .

====2019====
In April 2017, the Portland Timbers unveiled a US$85 million renovation plan which would add roughly 4,000 new seats to the East End. Timbers&#x27; President of Business Mike Golub stated that &quot;We felt it was imperative to see how we could transform the stadium and add capacity to both meet the demand that we have for tickets and also position the club to be viable and competitive for years to come&quot;, referencing the Timbers&#x27; current season ticket waitlist of approximately 13,000. The renovation was privately funded and brought the stadium to a capacity of 25,218, which was the 4th-highest of any soccer-specific venue in MLS.

The club partnered with Portland-based Allied Works Architecture to design the expansion, and began construction in late 2017, with the goal of having the renovated stadium ready in late May or early June of the 2019 MLS season.

The expanded Providence Park opened for the first time on June 1, 2019, as the Timbers hosted LAFC, selling out the capacity of 25,218. Included in the $85 million renovation were the addition of three decks of new seats, two new video boards and a modern edge-to-edge roof, as well as updated LED lighting throughout the park. The lowest tier of the new addition is a premium seating section named Tanner Ridge, a reference to Tanner Creek under the stadium, and includes separate food and beverage options from the rest of the stadium.
The renovated stand on the East End was the largest single seat expansion in Providence Park history. The vertically stacked stand resembles the Boca Juniors&#x27; stadium La Bombonera and was inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre. The new stands also resemble an original, unrealized design from 1926 for the stadium that shows 2-story stands. White seats in the added upper decks spell out &quot;SC USA&quot;, a reference to Portland&#x27;s NASL-era nickname of &quot;Soccer City USA.&quot; This added to existing seats in the east stand that spell out &quot;PORTLAND&quot;.

In 2019, Timbers and Thorns ownership were in discussions with Portland mayor Ted Wheeler about replacing the artificial turf at Providence Park with real grass. A real grass field could make Providence Park more attractive for hosting international soccer matches. , Providence Park is the only soccer-specific stadium in MLS that doesn&#x27;t use real grass. It is also the only current or planned soccer-specific NWSL venue to use an artificial surface, and one of two NWSL venues, along with Seattle&#x27;s Lumen Field, to use an artificial surface. The NWSL moved its neutral-site 2021 championship match from Portland to Lynn Family Stadium in Louisville, Kentucky, a grass venue, after players publicly complained about the artificial surface and early kickoff time.

==Current tenants==
The stadium is currently home to the Portland Timbers of MLS, which the stadium has hosted in all of the club&#x27;s iterations since 1975, and the Portland Thorns FC of NWSL since 2013. Starting in 2022, the facility is also the home turf for the Oregon Onyx of the Western Ultimate League and the Portland Nitro of the American Ultimate Disc League.

===Portland Timbers===
The Portland Timbers hosted their first match at the stadium on May 2, 1975, against the Seattle Sounders. It was the first professional soccer match ever hosted at Providence Park. The club would get their first win just 5 days later on May 7, 1975, with Peter Withe scoring the first ever home Timbers goal in a 1–0 victory over Toronto Metros-Croatia. The Timbers were immediately successful at the stadium, only losing once during 1975 and setting the Timbers home attendance record of 33,503 in the NASL semifinals against the St. Louis Stars on August 17, 1975.

The team played at Providence Park (then called Civic Stadium) until 1982 before folding. However, they helped develop the soccer culture in Portland and the passionate fans at the park that still remain today.

The Portland Timbers were reborn in 1985, continuing to play at Civic Stadium. The club used the stadium during their time in the Western Soccer Alliance and the American Professional Soccer League until 1990.
A new Portland Timbers franchise was founded in 2001 and began to use the park again for its home games. The naming rights were sold to PGE and the stadium became known as PG&amp;E Park. A $38.5 million renovation was completed to allow for a more comfortable soccer experience. Around this time, the Timbers established themselves as one of the best-drawing teams in the A-League, averaging attendance above 5,000 in each of their four years of existence. As they moved to the USL, the club became more successful, going unbeaten at home in the 2007 regular season. In 2008, the club averaged 8,567 home fans, the second-highest in the USL First Division. In 2009, Portland was selected to become a Major League Soccer franchise, and in the same year the Timbers went unbeaten for a USL-record 24 matches in a row.

In 2011, the stadium was renovated to provide Portland with a premier location to watch the Timbers play in Major League Soccer as well as fit the standards required by the league. The $36 million renovation modernized the stadium, added a high-tech video board and added new seating and amenities. The park was renamed Jeld-Wen Field after Klamath Falls-based windows and doors company Jeld-Wen purchased the naming rights.
The stadium officially opened for Major League Soccer play on April 14, 2011, when the Timbers defeated the Chicago Fire, 4–2, before a sellout crowd of 18,627. This was the first time top-level American soccer had been played in the city of Portland since August 22, 1982.

Jeld-Wen Field was the site of the first Timbers playoff home game in their MLS history, defeating arch-rival Seattle 3–2 on November 2, 2013. This allowed the Timbers to win 5–3 on aggregate and clinch the two-game series, advancing to the Conference finals. In 2014, the stadium was renamed Providence Park after Providence Health &amp; Services bought the naming rights. Home victories over the Vancouver Whitecaps and FC Dallas in the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs provided a launch pad to the Timbers winning the 2015 MLS Cup. In 2018, Portland hosted two rounds of playoffs at Providence Park, rewarding the home support with crucial results as the Timbers defeated Seattle and Sporting Kansas City to advance to the MLS Cup Final. The Timbers defeated Minnesota United FC and Real Salt Lake in the 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs, which helped the Timbers advance to and host the 2021 MLS Cup Final, the first time Providence hosted the MLS championship game.

After the completion of the 2019 renovation, capacity at the park increased to 25,218. The Timbers played their first game at the park on July 1, 2019, against LAFC, selling out the expanded sections.

The Timbers have sold out every home game to date since their transition to MLS in 2011. Providence Park has been consistently cited as one of the best American soccer stadiums and as one of the best places to see Major League Soccer. MLS writer Charles Boehm described Timbers games at Providence Park &quot;one of North American soccer&#x27;s greatest spectacles&quot; in 2019.

===Portland Thorns FC===

The Thorns played their first season in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League in 2013, playing in Providence Park. The team&#x27;s first home match on April 21 provided the club its first victory, a 2–1 win over Seattle Reign FC. In addition to setting a new league record for attendance, the opening day crowd of 16,479 was bigger than any single-game attendance from Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer, the last women&#x27;s national league before the NWSL.

Portland won the NWSL Championship in 2013 and 2017, using home victories in the playoffs to propel them to the titles. Providence Park also hosted the 2015 NWSL Championship Game, where FC Kansas City defeated Seattle Reign FC, 1–0, to win the championship. It also hosted the 2021 NWSL Championship, where Portland also won the championship against NJ/NY Gotham FC 6–5 on penalties, with both teams scoring 1–1 in regulation.

The Thorns have had the highest average attendance in the league in each of their first seven seasons, and set a league attendance record of 25,218 at an August 11, 2019 match against the North Carolina Courage.

===Former tenants===
In 1933, pari-mutuel betting was legalized in Oregon, and by May 23 of that year the Multnomah Kennel Club hosted its first greyhound race on the stadium&#x27;s new track. The Kennel Club maintained its headquarters at the stadium until 1956, when the track was removed.

The Portland Beavers minor league baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) had played some games at Multnomah Field during 1905 when their Vaughn Street Park was temporarily reconfigured to host a track and field event. They moved into Multnomah Stadium in 1956 after over a half century at Vaughn Street, a wooden ballpark which was soon demolished. The sod from the field at Vaughn Street was transferred to the new venue; Civic Stadium installed artificial turf in 1969.

From 1973 to 1977 the independent Portland Mavericks of the Northwest League played their home games at the stadium. Actor Kurt Russell was an infielder for the Mavericks. The Beavers returned to Portland in 1978 until 1993 when they were moved out of the city again. The Class A Portland Rockies were established in 1995 and played at the park until 2000 when they were moved and renamed the Tri-City Dust Devils. In 2001, the Albuquerque Dukes were moved to Portland and renamed the &quot;Beavers&quot; marking the third time the franchise would occupy the park for their home games.

As a baseball venue, the stadium had an unorthodox south-southeast alignment, with home plate in the northwest corner (20th and Morrison) of the property.

After it was announced that Major League Soccer was moving a franchise to Providence Park (then known as PGE Park) the Beavers had to start looking for a new stadium. However, the plan never came to fruition and team owner Merritt Paulson put the Beavers up for sale. The club&#x27;s major-league parent, the San Diego Padres, purchased the team, which moved to Tucson, Arizona as the Tucson Padres. The team played its final game at the stadium on September 6, 2010.

The stadium hosted the USFL&#x27;s Portland Breakers, as well as the Portland Storm and Portland Thunder of the WFL.

Soccer has been hosted at Providence Park since the original Portland Timbers were founded in the original North American Soccer League in 1975. Various iterations of the team have called the stadium home, including the 1980s version in the Western Soccer Alliance and the 2000s version in the USL First Division before the MLS club was formed.

From 2008 to 2017, Providence Park was used as home for the Timbers U23s of the USL2, a development platform for the club. Following the 2017 season, the Portland U23s moved to Salem, OR.

During the last few months of the 2020 MLS season, Providence Park hosted home matches for Vancouver Whitecaps FC after COVID-19 cross-border restrictions imposed by the Canadian government prevented the team from playing matches in Canada.

==Events==

===Soccer===

On August 28, 1977, the stadium was site of the North American Soccer League Soccer Bowl &#x27;77 between the New York Cosmos and the Seattle Sounders, the last official game of the legendary Pelé. The Cosmos won the championship.

On September 7, 1997, the stadium hosted a World Cup soccer qualifying match between the United States men&#x27;s national team and Costa Rica. A raucous capacity crowd of 27,396 saw the U.S. squad win, 1–0, on a goal by Tab Ramos in the 79th minute. A loud and knowledgeable stadium fully cheering on the USMNT in Portland created an atmosphere that &quot;took years for any other American city to match&quot;.

Providence Park has hosted the United States men&#x27;s national team on 4 different occasions. Outside of tournament play in the 1998 World Cup qualifying and the 2013 Gold Cup, the stadium has hosted two friendlies: on April 4, 1985, against Canada (a 1–1 draw), and on May 28, 1998, against Kuwait (a 2–0 win).

The stadium was the site of four group matches in the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup. The stadium also hosted two group matches, two quarterfinals, and both semifinals in the 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Providence Park hosted the 2014 MLS All-Star Game. 

On December 11, 2021, Providence Park hosted the 2021 MLS Cup after the Timbers won the Western Conference Final over Real Salt Lake and are the highest seed remaining. The stadium saw a total attendance of 25,218 spectators.

===College football===

Known as Multnomah Stadium at the time, the venue was formally dedicated on Oct. 9, 1926, as the University of Washington&#x27;s football team beat the University of Oregon, 23–9, with more than 24,000 fans in attendance.

The Providence Park all-time college football attendance record was set on October 18, 1930 as 35,266 fans watched the Oregon Ducks defeat their rival the Washington Huskies by a score of 7–0.

On 7 different occasions the Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry game was held at Providence Park, with the last time being in 1952, where the Beavers beat the Ducks 22-19.

Both Oregon and Oregon State regularly played games, especially against nearby Washington, at Providence Park up until the 1960s and 1970s. At the time, the stadium could hold or draw more fans than the schools&#x27; home fields, so it was a logical space for high-stakes games. The Ducks last played in Providence on September 12, 1970, defeating the University of California 31-24. The Beavers played in Portland all the way up until 1986, with their last game until 2022 being a 49-0 blowout loss to #15 UCLA on November 1, 1986.

Providence Park, then known as Civic Stadium, was home to many generations of high-octane offense from the Portland State Vikings, including from 1975 to 1980 when Mouse Davis, the &quot;godfather&quot; of the run and shoot offense and Portland State Football Hall of Famer, was the head coach of PSU. While coaching at Civic, he led the PSU football program to a 42–24 record over six seasons while averaging 38 points and nearly 500 yards of offense per game. PSU led the nation in scoring three times. The unique passing game made stars out of Davis&#x27; two main quarterbacks, June Jones and Neil Lomax. In 1975, Jones threw for a Division II record 3,518 yards. Davis&#x27; next quarterback, Lomax, set NCAA records of 13,220 yards and 106 touchdowns in 42 games. Under Davis&#x27; direction, Portland State set 20 NCAA Division II offensive records in addition to the Vikings being named the NCAA&#x27;s all-time point producers in 1980, scoring 541 points in 11 games for 49.2 points per game, along with 434.9 yards passing and 504.3 yards of total offense per game.
During a November 9, 1980 game, Lomax threw for seven first-quarter touchdowns against Delaware State, which the Vikings won 105–0.

On October 27, 2007, the stadium hosted the highest-scoring game in modern NCAA football history, when the Weber State University Wildcats defeated the PSU Vikings, 73–68, a combined point total of 141 points. This point total eclipsed the previous NCAA record of 136 points, set in a 1968 Division III game, and the previous Division I record of 133 points, set in 2004. While this record lasted only two weeks, and has been surpassed four times in all, it remained the highest-scoring game involving NCAA Division I teams until 2018, when Texas A&amp;M defeated LSU in a 74–72 seven-overtime game. Coincidentally, Mouse Davis was the offensive coordinator for Portland State at the time, returning to Providence Park under the head coaching of Jerry Glanville.

Oregon State played FCS Montana State in Providence Park on September 17, 2022, due to OSU&#x27;s Reser Stadium being under construction. It was the first game in the stadium hosted by an FBS team since the Beavers last did it in 1986. The Beavers won the game 68–28.

===Baseball===

Given that the stadium&#x27;s primary purposes originally were track and field, football, and dog racing, it had somewhat odd dimensions for baseball. Due to the curving northern stands, foul territory along the third base line was much larger than that along the first.

During the 1970s, the Jantzen swim wear company had a 3D model of the Jantzen girl attached to the left field wall in its baseball configuration. The Jantzen girl was in play because it was below the top of the wall and it was hit a couple of times over the years. The Jantzen girl was removed from the outfield wall during renovations and is now on display in the concourse under the west stands.
On May 27, 1991, the stadium received national attention when Vancouver Canadians outfielder Rodney McCray, while attempting to catch a fly ball, crashed through a wooden advertisement behind the warning track in right-center field; a real-life version of an incident in the fictional book and film, &quot;The Natural&quot;. While McCray failed to make the out, he only suffered scrapes and bruises and remained in the game. Highlight reels of that play ran for weeks on cable channels such as CNN and ESPN. On August 12, 2006, the Beavers commemorated the event with a Rodney McCray Bobblehead Night, passing out bobbleheads of McCray to fans and renaming right-center field &quot;McCray Alley&quot;.

In the mid-1990s the stadium was planned to be the home of the yet-to-be named Portland team, a charter franchise of the United League (UL) which was planned to be a third league of Major League Baseball (MLB).

On July 15, 2009, the stadium hosted the Triple-A All-Star Game, with the International League stars defeating the Pacific Coast league, 6–5. The game was attended by 16,637 fans, the largest crowd for a Triple-A All-Star game since 1991, and the third largest at the time. Portland&#x27;s Chad Huffman won the Home Run Derby.

===Concerts===
While on a four-day tour of the Pacific Northwest, September 2, 1957, Elvis Presley performed in one of the first three outdoor stadium rock concerts in music history. Presley had held the second ever in Vancouver, BC, Canada just a few days earlier, on September 1, 1957, at Empire Stadium, his first being at the Cotton Bowl, in Dallas, TX, on 11 October 1956. The concert created mass hysteria and an estimated 14,600 people attended the concert.

In a November 8, 2013 interview with the Portland Business Journal, Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson expressed his desire to host summer concerts at the stadium.

==Art and design==

Providence Park&#x27;s outside walls are covered with naturally-grown ivy. The entrance billboard used to announce dates and future games is a deliberate retro replica of the old scoreboard that used to be in the same location.

Multiple art installations and sculptures line the outside plazas of Providence Park. Those include &quot;Facing the Crowd&quot;, a series of two bronze sculptures, and &quot;You Are Here&quot;, an artistic rendition of a 12-foot wide log ring with historical artifacts of Portland&#x27;s past embedded inside.

==In popular culture==
In 2010, Providence Park was a filming location of Season 2 of the television series &quot;Leverage&quot;. The episode depicts a fictional Massachusetts (where the series was set) minor league team also known as the Beavers.

The IFC show &quot;Portlandia&quot; references Providence Park multiple times throughout the series and the lead characters Peter (Fred Armisen) and Nance (Carrie Brownstein) attend a Timbers match in a 2012 episode, bringing along a home-made sign to root for the club.

Providence Park was added to the stadium rotation in the FIFA video game series for the first time in September 2020, beginning with FIFA 21. Providence became the sixth Major League Soccer stadium added to the game, and the addition allowed for the access of all three Cascadia clubs&#x27; home stadiums for the first time. The Thorns&#x27; inclusion in FIFA 23 also made Providence Park one of four NWSL venues featured in the game.

==Feral cat colony==
Since approximately 1985, the field has been home to a feral cat colony, which may have been at the park before the current stadium opened in 1926. There are an estimated 12–19 cats in the colony, referred to as &quot;living rat traps&quot;. After a construction worker killed a feral cat in 2000, the park enlisted the Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon to assist the animals during construction efforts and to run a trap-neuter-return program. The cats are discussed in Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s travelogue of Portland, &quot;Fugitives and Refugees&quot;.

<text>The St. Paul Civic Center was an indoor arena located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The arena opened in 1973 and was closed and demolished in 1998. It once sat near the Ordway Music Theater and the Roy Wilkins Auditorium. The Xcel Energy Center was built on the former site of the arena. 

==History==
The arena opened on January 1, 1973, and had seating capacity of approximately 16,000 for hockey. The arena could be expanded up to 17,800 for concerts and other non-sporting events. The Civic Center was the home of both iterations of the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the WHA—the first from 1973 to 1976 and the second from 1976 to 1977. The boys&#x27; state high school hockey and basketball tournaments were also held at the Civic Center as well as three NCAA Frozen Four national ice hockey championships. The arena was also the home of Verne Gagne&#x27;s American Wrestling Association (AWA).

The arena was unique in North America in that the hockey dasher boards were made of clear acrylic glass from the shelf all the way down to the ice. This was because the arena&#x27;s seating configuration was round, and the closest seats between the blue lines were not flush against the boards.

Previously not an issue when dasher board advertising was rare, the clear boards made for better sightlines for most spectators seated between the blue lines, since the seating angles in the Civic Center were shallow. When the Minnesota Moose of the International Hockey League played their two seasons, they were replaced with standard white opaque boards to allow advertising. The new boards were disadvantageous to the previous seating arrangements, and with the Moose&#x27;s quick departure to Winnipeg, showed the arena was outdated for the state&#x27;s most popular sport only 21 years after opening, much less National Hockey League standards.

==Popular culture==
On June 28, 1984, Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band, actress Courteney Cox and 200 extras filmed the Brian De Palma-directed music video for &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; at the arena, one day before Springsteen&#x27;s 1984 Born in the U.S.A. Tour formally opened at the arena.

The song &quot;I Bought a Headache&quot; from The Replacements&#x27; album &quot;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&quot; is about regretting purchasing an $8.50 ticket to a rock concert that is so loud it makes his head hurt. Billy Joel recorded and released a live version of his song, &quot;Streetlife Serenader&quot;. The song was recorded from a 1980 concert held at the arena.

<text>TV Globo (, &quot;Globe TV&quot;) is a Brazilian free-to-air television network, launched by media proprietor Roberto Marinho on 26 April 1965. It is owned by media conglomerate Grupo Globo, in turn owned by Marinho&#x27;s heirs. The network is by far the largest of its holdings. TV Globo is the largest commercial TV network in Latin America and the second largest commercial TV networks in the world and the largest producer of telenovelas. All of this makes Globo renowned as one of the most important television networks in the world and Grupo Globo as one of the largest media groups.

Rede Globo is headquartered in the Jardim Botânico neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, where its news division is based. The network&#x27;s main production studios are located at a complex dubbed Estúdios Globo, located in Jacarepaguá, in the same city. TV Globo is composed of 5 owned-and-operated television stations and 122 affiliates throughout Brazil plus its own international networks, TV Globo Internacional and TV Globo Portugal. In 2007, TV Globo moved its analog operations to high-definition television production for digital broadcasting.

According to Brazilian national and international statistical data, TV Globo is one of the largest media companies in the world, and produces around 2,400 hours of entertainment and 3,000 hours of journalism per year in Brazil. Through its network, the broadcaster covers 98.6% of Brazil&#x27;s territory. Recognized for its production quality, the company has already been presented with 14 international Emmys. The international operations of TV Globo include seven pay-per-view television channels and a production and distribution division that distributes Brazilian sports and entertainment content to more than 190 countries around the world.

In Brazil, Rede Globo presently reaches 99.5% of potential viewers, practically the entire Brazilian population, with 5 owned-and-operated stations and 131 network affiliates that deliver programming to more than 183 million Brazilians. The network has been responsible for the 20 most-watched TV programs broadcast on Brazilian television, including &quot;Avenida Brasil&quot;, a 2012 record-breaking telenovela that reached 50 million viewers and was sold to 130 countries.

The successful programming structure of TV Globo has not changed since the 1970s: In primetime Monday through Saturday it airs four telenovelas and the newscast &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot;. The three telenovelas, along with other productions are made in the net&#x27;s Projac, the largest production center in South America.
The four top-rated TV shows in Brazil are Globo&#x27;s flashy hourlong soap operas, called novelas, at 6 pm, 7 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. nightly, and Globo&#x27;s national evening news at 8 p.m.—all from the network&#x27;s own studios. Globo also produces 90% of its programming.

Rede Globo (as it is known) has had a near monopoly on TV viewership and a symbiotic relationship with successive military and civilian governments. Its political and cultural sway in Brazil is unrivaled. &quot;Globo has a very persuasive influence on diverse aspects of Brazilian society,&quot; comments Raul Reis, a former Brazilian journalist. Producing Brazilian-made programming in accordance with international technical standards, the television network grew to become the flagship of multimedia Globo Organization including cellular phone service, cable, television stations in Portugal and Mexico, book and magazine publishing, Internet and film production. Globo&#x27;s cultural and financial power continues to grow. The company is dramatically expanding its role in Brazilian and Latin American media, transforming itself from an old-style family fiefdom into a twenty-first-century media conglomerate. Most recently, Globo struck a strategic alliance with Microsoft, which paid $126 million in August for an 11.5 percent share in Globo Cabo, the company&#x27;s cable subsidiary. Now an international economic powerhouse, TV Globo no longer needs the perks its proximity to local power once offered: It is on the road to becoming Latin America&#x27;s prime player in the world&#x27;s mass-media market.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

The roots of TV Globo can be traced to the beginning of the 20th century. What eventually became the Globo empire began in 1925 with the creation of the newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot; in Rio de Janeiro. In 1944, &quot;Rádio Globo&quot; went on the air and has become a school of radio broadcast news. It was the first radio network in Brazil to follow a 24-hour all news format. It had 26 wholly owned and affiliated stations.

In July 1963, Brazilian President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco approved a request by &quot;Rádio Globo&quot; to establish a television channel. On 30 December 1957, the National Council of Telecommunication (Portuguese: Conselho Nacional de Telecomunicações, or CONTEL) published a decree which granted a channel in Rio de Janeiro to TV Globo Ltda. &quot;Globo&quot; then started preparing the beginning of its television broadcasting operations.

In 1965, the Rede Globo de Televisão was created. It was the beginning of the Globo television network and vital component in the growth and expansion of the Globo organizations.

Globo began broadcasting on 26 April 1965 in Rio de Janeiro on channel 4. That same day, at about 10:45 a.m., Rubens Amaral formally introduced Rede Globo to viewers in Rio de Janeiro, and all over Guanabara State, with the song &quot;Moon River&quot; by Henry Mancini at the start of the children&#x27;s show, &quot;Uni Duni Te&quot;. By May of that same year, the live telecast of the Holy Mass, which later became its longest running and oldest program, was seen for the first time. The following year, Globo purchased another television station, São Paulo-based TV Paulista, expanding its operations and beginning to dominate national television ratings. In January 1966, Globo broadcast its first major news coverage on flooding in Rio de Janeiro.

&quot;Jornal da Globo&quot;, another trademark show for the network, was the successor to &quot;Tele Globo&quot; (1965–66), the network&#x27;s first news program that ran until 1966. It featured a broadcast time of 30 minutes and was hosted by Hilton Gomez and, later, Luis Jatoba. In 1967, Globo began to build its national network with the affiliation of Porto Alegre-based TV Gaúcha (now RBS TV). TV Gaúcha would become Globo&#x27;s affiliate in Florianópolis in the late 1970s, when it received its current name. It is one of &quot;Globo&quot;″s oldest affiliates, active since 1962, three years before &quot;Globo&quot; was launched. Uberlândia&#x27;s TV Triângulo (now &quot;Rede Integração&quot;) and Goiânia&#x27;s &quot;TV Anhanguera&quot; (now &quot;Rede Anhanguera&quot;) soon followed in 1967 and 1968. The now extinct TV Guajará, based in Belém, was launched in 1969, and was followed by TV Verdes Mares the following year. 1968 was also the year in which Globo&#x27;s branch station in Belo Horizonte, TV Globo Minas, was launched.

=== Jornal Nacional and the climb to the dominance of Brazilian television (1969–80) ===
==== JN, Jornal Hoje and the Plim-plim jingle ====
On 1 September 1969, the country and national television broadcasting changed with the premiere of &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot; (&quot;National News&quot;), the nation&#x27;s first live newscast anchored by Cid Moreira and Hilton Gomez. Its theme music, &quot;The Fuzz&quot; by Frank DeVol, became one of the show&#x27;s trademarks, together with the program logo and the &quot;Boa Noite&quot; (&quot;Good night&quot;) closing established by the hosts. Its success was followed by the launch of &quot;Jornal Hoje&quot; (&quot;Today&#x27;s News&quot;) on 21 April 1971, the same day in which its Brasília station (TV Globo Brasília, Channel 10) was inaugurated. The program was exclusively shown on the Rede Globo Rio de Janeiro (Channel 4) flagship station until 1974 when it became a nationwide midday newscast. It broadcast its first FIFA World Cup in 1970, the same year in which the Rede Excelsior network closed down, absorbed by &quot;Globo&quot;. The network&#x27;s famous &quot;Plim-Plim&quot; interval sound also debuted that year.

==== A new corporate image ====

The network&#x27;s 1976 broadcasting scheduling process developed the Padrão Globo de Qualidade (Globo&#x27;s Quality Standard): two soap operas, followed by its flagship &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot;, and one to two more drama shows or cinema, comedy programming and others, including &quot;Globo Reporter&quot; and the late newscasts. The programming schedule would later be adapted for regional affiliates with the addition of local news broadcasts on select hours. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when &quot;Rede Excelsior&quot; was launched (the process was inherited by &quot;Rede Globo&quot; upon Excelsior&#x27;s closure in 1970). The network&#x27;s audience share increased in the late 1970s, eventually clinching the top ratings spot of Brazil television. This was the reason Silvio Santos, one of the network&#x27;s original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 11-year-old program (Programa Silvio Santos, &quot;The Silvio Santos Show&quot;) to Rede Tupi, while putting up his own network, TVS (now SBT) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. In the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on São Paulo&#x27;s RecordTV until 1987, on Rede Tupi until 1980, and on TVS, now SBT, until the present day.
&quot;Os Trapalhões&quot; began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network&#x27;s morning news program, &quot;Bom Dia São Paulo&quot; (Good Morning São Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1975 would also be the first time its present corporate logo was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was then a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network&#x27;s first presentation package with the new corporate logo for the first time with the help of New York-based Dolphin Productions - making Globo the first national network to use the Scanimate system of computer animation and the second TV station in Brazil to adopt it after TVS in Rio de Janeiro, the first TV channel to use the system in 1976. That year also marked the premiere of &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot; (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), one of the network&#x27;s famous children&#x27;s series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007 (both were live-action ones) and from April 2007, it has an animated version as well but the 2000 logo version of &quot;Globo&quot; that they used turned out to be their last.

The network&#x27;s second successful FIFA World Cup telecast after its first (FIFA World Cup 1978) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of &quot;Globo Esporte&quot; (&quot;Globo Sports&quot;), the network&#x27;s daily sports newscast, still airing before &quot;Jornal Hoje&quot;, then anchored by Luciano do Valle. That same year, &quot;Caso Especial&quot; ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, &quot;Aplauso&quot;. The decade closed with the premiere of the &quot;Domingo Maior&quot; (Great Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, the &quot;Cinema Especial&quot; holiday film specials, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the &quot;Jornal das Sete&quot; (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979–83, precursor to the network&#x27;s local news programs of today. &quot;Jornal da Globo&quot; was anchored by Sergio Chapelin at the time and aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes. &quot;Domingo Global&quot;, the musical program showcasting both Brazilian and international music, also made its debut.

=== At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980–90) ===
As &quot;Rede Globo&quot; marked its 15th year of broadcasts in 1980–81, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that Rede Tupi shut down all of its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15th Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the &quot;Os Trapalhões&quot; marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television.

&quot;Vale a Pena Ver de Novo&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Worth Watching Once Again&quot;), an afternoon drama block, debuted on 5 May that year. &quot;Globo Rural&quot;, its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays. Another debut program was the woman-oriented &quot;TV Mulher&quot;.

==== More surprises and shows ====

1981 saw the debut of the top-rating comedy program &quot;Viva O Gordo&quot; with Jô Soares at the helm, one of the network&#x27;s many mainstay comedies of the decade. Aside from its 1982 FIFA World Cup coverage in 1982, the network premiered the children&#x27;s show &quot;Balão Mágico&quot; (&quot;Magic Balloon&quot;), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children&#x27;s musical group Turma do Balão Mágico, whose music struck a chord with its viewers. 1982 saw the &quot;Jornal da Globo&quot; relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.

1983 saw the birth of another network hit: &quot;Vídeo Show&quot;, successfully airing until 2019. Its first program host was Tássia Camargo. The network&#x27;s daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983 to 1994), it gives an inside look of the network&#x27;s programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo&#x27;s historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program&#x27;s early co-hosts. It had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Aragão of &quot;Os Trapalhões&quot;, lasting until 1986. Another success was the top-rating drama &quot;Guerra Dos Sexos&quot; in the evening slots.

Also debuting that year were the &quot;Praça TV&quot; local newscasts (the names of the program were different depending on the state or locality it was transmitted to; &quot;RJTV&quot;, &quot;SPTV&quot;, &quot;MGTV&quot;, &quot;DFTV&quot;, &quot;NETV&quot;, &quot;ABTV&quot;, &quot;ALTV&quot;, &quot;BATV&quot;, &quot;Brasil TV&quot;, &quot;CETV&quot;, &quot;ESTV&quot; (today &quot;Gazeta Meio Dia&quot; and &quot;Boa Noite Espírito Santo&quot;), &quot;GRTV&quot;, &quot;JMTV&quot;, &quot;MSTV&quot;, &quot;MTTV&quot;, &quot;Paraná TV&quot; (today &quot;Meio Dia Paraná&quot; and &quot;Boa Noite Paraná&quot;), &quot;PITV&quot;, &quot;RNTV&quot;, &quot;SETV&quot;, between others), aired twice a day and the national version of the network&#x27;s São Paulo morning newscast, &quot;Bom Dia Brasil&quot; (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo&#x27;s Brasília studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcast in full then in Globo&#x27;s Recife, Brasília and Belo Horizonte stations because São Paulo (1977–) and Rio de Janeiro (1983–84 and 1989–) had their own local editions (Bom Dia Praça) of the newscast.

In 1984, it not only premiered its &quot;Supercine&quot; film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended Praça TV to late night as a result of the &quot;Jornal da Globo&quot; relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute &quot;Praça TV Terceira Edição&quot; (Praça TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day&#x27;s local news in their own networks after Jornal da Globo was aired. By then, Eliakim Araújo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and had Jô Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was &quot;Praça TV Sunday Editions&quot;, lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as &quot;Fantastico&quot;&#x27;s preview show in the midday and early evening editions. It was also the year of the Diretas Já (Direct Elections (for president) Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot; had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign&#x27;s progress.

=== 1985–89: Globo at 20, countdown to 25 ===

1985 was Globo&#x27;s 20th anniversary. It was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One reason was the &quot;Festival 20 Anos&quot; (&quot;20 Years Festival&quot;) showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of &quot;Roque Santeiro&quot;, then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on &quot;Rede Globo&quot; newer than its planned previous edition, and the debut of &quot;Corujão&quot;, its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country&#x27;s military rule of 21 years. Since it is the last program before sign-off except for some days of the week, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network&#x27;s sign-off plug, showing the next day&#x27;s programming. SOS Nordeste Urgente ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the &quot;Criança Esperança&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Hope&quot;) charity telethon, to be aired the next year.

In 1986, Editora Globo, the Globo publishing house, was established. It holds 10% of the Brazilian magazine market, Brazil&#x27;s second largest publisher leading in several segments of the market.

1986 was the key year when Xuxa Meneghel&#x27;s own show, &quot;Xou da Xuxa&quot; (&quot;Xuxa&#x27;s Show&quot;) debuted on Rede Globo. Xuxa, who left the similarly formatted program &quot;Clube da Criança&quot; on &quot;Rede Manchete&quot;, joined the network and thus, her show replaced the successful &quot;Balão Mágico&quot; as a result. It was a hit among children in all the country, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1992. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os Trapalhões, which lasted until 1987. The network&#x27;s other big program was its coverage of the 1986 Copa Ouro, plus the first telecast of the &quot;Criança Esperança&quot; children&#x27;s charity show, which Renato Aragão (of Os Trapalhões) hosted. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed. 1987 saw yet more improved programming debut in all areas. In 1988, &quot;Vale Tudo&quot;, one of Brazilian television&#x27;s best dramas, premiered on the channel followed by its &quot;Tela Quente&quot; (&quot;Hot Screen&quot;) weekly film block, aired on Mondays.

On 26 March 1989, the network&#x27;s own Sunday variety program, &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot; (&quot;Faustão&#x27;s Big-Sunday&quot;), was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT&#x27;s &quot;Programa Silvio Santos&quot;. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before &quot;Fantástico&quot;. Another newcomer was the &quot;Temperatura Máxima&quot; film block, airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally airing on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Praça TV in the local level.

Even &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot; and &quot;Jornal da Globo&quot; got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of &quot;The Fuzz&quot; plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by William Bonner and Fátima Bernardes (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to &quot;Jornal Hoje&quot;), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined &quot;Fantástico&quot; along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as &quot;Jornal Hoje&quot; principal anchor (replacing Cordeiro) and joined &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot; as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with &quot;Fantástico&quot; until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila&#x27;s own wedding. The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo&#x27;s 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their years-end campaign video commemorating its 25th anniversary, in which most of the network&#x27;s artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme song. In 1990, Globo turned 25 years old. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (&quot;25 Years Festival&quot;) of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:

* &quot;Escolinha do Professor Raimundo&quot; (weekday afternoons)

TV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to Rede Manchete&#x27;s &quot;Pantanal&quot; drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening, and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the 1990 FIFA World Cup that same year, and covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.

=== 1991–1992: The countdown to 30 years and Globosat Networks ===

1991 saw the birth of &quot;Globosat&quot;, the Globo Organization&#x27;s own cable service, of which &quot;Rede Globo&quot; was but part. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 30 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of &quot;O Dono do Mundo&quot;, another of its top record dramas, plus &quot;Vamp&quot;, its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a South American hit. Plantão JN, Globo&#x27;s own breaking news service was relaunched into &quot;Plantão da Globo&quot; that year, and Fausto Silva began hosting his own New Year&#x27;s program. Globo became the official network for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; when it made its national premiere. Its 6:00 soap opera, &quot;Felicidade&quot;, marked yet another first for the network because it had a woman director, Denise Saraceni, for the first time in national television drama history.

By the next year, President Collor&#x27;s impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo&#x27;s news and sports teams. Globo became the official network for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and it carried to the television audience all over the nation the journey of the Brazil national football team into its fourth championship. It would be also a great year for its drama and news departments. However, May Day celebrations that year were marred by the sudden death that same day of the nation&#x27;s Formula One hero, Ayrton Senna, during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. As the official F1 broadcaster, it brought the sad news of his demise to the nation and covered its aftermath with special coverages and the huge national mourning for his sudden loss.

=== 1995–1999: Into the 21st century and the 5th century of Brazil ===

&quot;Globo&quot; turned 30 on 1 January 1995. The highlights of the year included the opening of the brand new Estúdios Globo studios and the launch of a new youth oriented program: Malhação, plus its Festival 30 Anos (30 Years Festival) commemorative series. It was the year that Os Trapalhões ended a long successful run on the network, and the Plim Plim interval idents were updated by various cartoonists for the anniversary. &quot;Globo&quot; suffered a year of audience losses but in 1996 audience share began to increase until they were the nation&#x27;s number one network, aided by brand new programs (among them were the telenovela &quot;O Rei do Gado&quot; and the very popular sitcom &quot;Sai de Baixo&quot;) and its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, coupled with changes in the newsrooms. &quot;Globo&quot; was the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, &quot;Globo News&quot;, which started in the same year. Now based in both São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the latter the main headquarters, it broadcast replays of &quot;Globo&quot; news programs, and had its own news programs and commentaries. The network ratings were threatened by the top rated programming from SBT and Record, but in 1998 the network recovered its top place with its 1998 FIFA World Cup live coverage, although violent images became an issue when its 9 P.M. telenovela Torre de Babel was pulled off the air. Holiday programming was boosted by its New Year&#x27;s Eve premiere of &quot;Show da Virada&quot;, Aloysio Legey&#x27;s creation and Brazil&#x27;s response to international New Year television celebrations worldwide. That year was also the start of its ground breaking Brazil 500 project aimed at preparing the nation for its 500th anniversary of European discovery.

&quot;Globo&quot; has since expanded to become the largest TV Network in Brazil, with over $2 billion in revenue in 1992.

=== 2000: Globo at the beginning of the new millennium and the golden year of Brazilian television ===
2000, the 35th anniversary of Globo, the 50th of Brazilian television and the 500th for Brazil, was highlighted by its &quot;TV Ano 50&quot; series honoring the first five decades of Brazilian television, and the Brazil 500 festival concert, the launch of three brand new variety shows (the Saturday afternoon hit Caldeirão do Huck, the late weeknight Programa do Jô with Jo Soares and Altas Horas, with Serginho Groisman, aired on Sunday midnights), new dramas, and its 2000 Summer Olympics coverage, and was capped off by the Titanic two-part premiere in December as part of Cinema Especial (for the first time in Brazilian TV), another ratings record breaker. &quot;Globo&quot; became a pioneer in reality-based programming with the premiere of two reality programs: &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; and &quot;No Limite&quot;, the former of which would continue to air for a total of twenty seasons.

=== 2001–2003: The success of &quot;O Clone&quot;, coverage of the World Cup and the death of Roberto Marinho ===
2001 started well for Globo, despite a fire at the Xuxa Park set in January that caused the show to end its run. The network had low audience ratings in several programs, two dramas were national hits, and the second version of &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot; children&#x27;s program debuted. In the news departments the network covered the 9/11 attacks in the United States, and continued its coverage in the long aftermath.

On 1 October 2001, &quot;O Clone&quot; debuted and enjoyed both critical and popular success. It was written by Glória Perez and featured a large cast of stars. The telenovela was exported to 91 countries and has also become an international success.

&quot;Globo&quot; aired the 2002 World Cup as national broadcaster. On 23 November 2002, the Canadian rock band Rush came to Rio de Janeiro, and performed a 3-hour-long set at the Maracanã Stadium. This concert was broadcast live on Globo and later released on DVD.

On 6 August 2003, owner and president of &quot;Globo&quot;, Roberto Marinho, died at age 98 in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro. His three children assumed leadership of the network in the aftermath and Globo provided national coverage of the mourning that followed up till his burial.

=== 2004–2019: Continued dominance, decline of telenovelas, and Globo vs. Record ===

For Globo, 2004 was the beginning of the long decline of viewership support for its legendary telenovelas, but the year was one of the strongest for television drama as telenovelas &quot;Da Cor do Pecado&quot; and &quot;Senhora do Destino&quot; made high ratings one after the other. The year saw its 2004 Athens Olympics Coverage as well and debuted &quot;Brazil TV&quot; in the afternoon bringing national news stories for satellite viewers. 
2004–2005 was the year that changed the network&#x27;s viewers as it marked its 40th anniversary years with mixed feelings, due to the improving situation of &quot;Rede Record&quot;, to which some &quot;Globo&quot; talent began decamping. The year ended in a high note for the network: &quot;Alma Gêmea&quot; and &quot;Belíssima&quot; scored high audience ratings in drama, and the network transmitted to viewers nationwide the robbery at the Central Bank of Fortaleza via &quot;TV Verdes Mares&quot;.

2006 started out with the record-breaking live coverage of U2&#x27;s successful 20–21 February São Paulo concerts, another triumph in the audience ratings. Despite several scandals that rocked the network it did a great job covering the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the Presidential elections of that year. By 2007, Globo began its digital television broadcasts, and several hit programs were aired, including hit 9 pm drama &quot;Paraíso Tropical&quot;. The network also became the official home for the broadcasts of the 2007 Pan-American Games held in Rio de Janeiro. That same year, the &quot;Plim Plim&quot; idents were returned after Globo stopped using these idents since 1995. Globo revised its logo yet again in 2008 (resizing the screen from 4:3 to 16:9), and started using its iconic logo for its O&amp;O stations nationwide. Its &quot;Rede Fuso&quot; program for states outside the Brasília time zone launched, affecting programming in these areas.

2009 saw Globo witnessing the victory of &quot;Caminho das Índias&quot; in the national ratings in the 9 pm slot, which earned it an International Emmy Awards nomination and subsequent win, alongside the high rating 6 pm soap &quot;Paraíso&quot;, a reboot of the 1982 original, the first 6 pm drama since 2007 to post high audience ratings. The death of Michael Jackson that June was honored with a special &quot;Globo Reporter&quot; on 26 June, the day after his death, and made an historic effort to broadcast the golden jubilee concert of Roberto Carlos in HD on 11 July. In August, &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary. All this happened just as the Globo-Record rivalry erupted yet again late in the year, given several reports on Globo&#x27;s news programs that countered those on Record that were targeting the network.

The IBOPE ratings of São Paulo metropolitan area shows that Globo telenovelas has lost, between 2004 and 2008, 26.2% of viewership, although Globo is still the leader network. Its previous 9 p.m. telenovela, &quot;Viver a Vida&quot;, had an average rating of 37 points, an all-time low for Globo. But eventually overtaken by &quot;Passione&quot; (2010–11) and &quot;Insesato Coração&quot; (2011), who obtained an average of 35 points. These indices showed improvement in the ratings of the telenovelas &quot;Fina Estampa&quot; (2011–12) and &quot;Avenida Brasil&quot; (2012). In 2005, a Globo telenovela&#x27;s rating reached 38% but by 2010, another telenovela garnered just 25.4%. Record&#x27;s telenovelas grew in popularity, as from 6.5% in 2005, the ratings more than doubled to 14% in 2010.

&quot;Globo&quot; was hit hard in news: &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot;, &quot;Bom Dia Brasil&quot;, and &quot;Fantástico&quot; lost 27%, 20%, and 29% of their audiences, respectively, as three Rede Record news programs (&quot;Jornal Da Record&quot;, &quot;Fala Brasil&quot;, and &quot;Domingo Espetacular&quot;) posed serious competition. In addition, &quot;Fala Brasil&quot;, as of 2010, has overtaken &quot;Bom Dia Brasil&quot;, while &quot;Domingo Espetacular&quot; overtook &quot;Fantástico&quot; in Goiânia, Belém, and Fortaleza. Telenovelas in the 1980s easily reached over 50 present, &quot;Vale Tudo&quot; and &quot;O Salvador da Pátria&quot; being notable examples.

In 2010, as &quot;Globo&quot; celebrated its 45th year, viewers watched Globo&#x27;s coverage of the Rio de Janeiro floods in January, attacks by drug gangs in April, plus the historic arrest that November of two suspects in the Tim Lopes case from 2002. Despite the rising tide of support for Record programs, part of the big triumphs in this anniversary year was the &quot;Ti Ti Ti&quot; remake, which was one of the year&#x27;s top rating dramas (also the first HD soap to be produced and made in this format on the 7 pm slot), the first 6 pm drama made in HD, &quot;Araguaia&quot;, and its JN no Ar project on Jornal Nacional, aiming to viewers nationwide with the newscasts visiting various Brazilian cities. In 2011, the year Globo launched its present slogan, &quot;O Clone&quot; was rebroadcast on &quot;Vale a Pena Ver de Novo&quot;, the longest in the history of that block and a ratings winner in its timeslot. &quot;Insensato Coração&quot;, the first ever drama to be officially declared a &quot;9 pm Drama&quot; (&quot;Novela das Nove&quot;) after years of titling them as 8 pm soaps, aired with great successes for 8 months that year. Alongside it was the first Globo news program in HD, &quot;Bem Estar&quot;, which debuted that February. April saw the record breaking &quot;Cordel Encantado&quot; debut episode, resulted in it being one of its highest rating 6 pm dramas to date and a hit among viewers nationwide. Xuxa celebrated her silver jubilee on the network with a special TV Xuxa episode that 2 July – the same day &quot;Glee&quot; hit Brazilian TV screens. 
The year of 2012 saw more hits with its debut season of the national version of The Ultimate Fighter, followed by yet another number one drama at the 9:00 pm slot, &quot;Avenida Brasil&quot;, as well as the modern reboot of the 1975 drama &quot;Gabriela&quot;. That April, the network made an overnight telecast of UFC 146 in both analog and high definition to national viewers.
As the network celebrated its golden jubilee in start of 2015, shaken by the unexpected move of Xuxa Meneghel to Record, the celebrations began on 2 January with a special retrospective showing of past miniseries. However, primetime dramas at the 9 pm slot were on the losing edge, especially during the second quarter of the year, given the poor standing of &quot;Babilônia&quot; against other networks in its time slot, the lowest ever ratings in recent years for a 9:00 pm drama, but would rebound once &quot;A Regra do Jogo&quot; premiered on 31 August. It won at the New York International Film and Television Festival in April, and the launch that spring of the network&#x27;s own on demand video site, Globoplay.

2016 saw Globo become the official broadcaster of the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first Olympic Games to be held in South America.

On 8 January 2019, Globo announced that &quot;Vídeo Show&quot; would be cancelled after 35 years due to declining ratings.

===2020–present===
On 12 March 2020, Globo announced plans to suspend production of all of its existing telenovelas and the vast majority of its series in order to comply with global restrictions that were put in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, with &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; continuing to be filmed without an audience for the remainder of its twentieth season. On 26 October 2020, Globo announced GExperience, an interactive experience in which visitors will be able to go behind the scenes of a live TV show and see memorabilia from Globo&#x27;s most famous novelas. Building work began in November 2020 and the experience is expected to open in April 2021 at the Market Place shopping centre in São Paulo. Also, on 26 April 2020, Rede Globo is celebrating its 55th anniversary due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are appearing different faces that they wear masks and have different emotions in the ident.
====2021====

On January 25, Fausto Silva announced that he would retire from his variety show &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot; at the end of the year. His timeslot was filled by a new version of &quot;Domingão&quot; hosted by Luciano Huck, while Marcos Mion took over Huck&#x27;s previous show &quot;Caldeirão&quot;. Meanwhile, Silva moved to rival network Band where he debuted a new show on weeknights.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in early March 2021 Globo decided to remove actors over the age of eighty from the recordings of soap operas. Less than two weeks later, actors over 69 were also removed. On March 23, the broadcaster stopped recording soap operas and series until April 19, due to the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 1, Globo sold its record label Som Livre to Sony Music for an undisclosed amount. On the 15th, the network started to make available its soundtracks of soap operas and series, in addition to podcasts and songs used in the musical realities in the Deezer application, also creating an exclusive package in Globoplay for subscribers with a free year on the premium account.

On April 28, Grupo Globo replaced the chairmanship of the Board of Directors, which had been occupied by Roberto Irineu Marinho since August 2003, when his father and founder of the conglomerate, Roberto Marinho, died. With the unanimous approval of the Board, his brother João Roberto Marinho assumed the presidency, and Roberto Irineu became vice-president of the group, along with the younger brother of the three, José Roberto Marinho.

On May 27, the rights to all matches in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers were acquired. Until then, the channel held the rights only to matches played by the Brazilian and Argentine teams as principals. The acquisition of the games came to be seen as a counterattack, as the broadcaster lost the bids for the broadcasting rights of the UEFA Champions league (season 2021/22 to 2023/24) and the 2021 Copa América to SBT.

Globo&#x27;s general audience in June was the worst for that month in the network&#x27;s entire history. With 11.3 points, it was the third consecutive month with decreasing audiences.

On September 28 it was announced the end of Malhação, after 27 seasons. The last unreleased season to air was (Toda Forma de Amar/Every way of loving), which had an early finale due to measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, only reruns such as (Viva a Diferença/live the difference) and (Sonhos/Dreams) have been shown, leading to the cancellation of productions for the seasons (Transformação/Transformation) and (Eu Quero é Ser Feliz/I want to be happy). The station&#x27;s planning is for a new schedule to replace the teen soap opera time.

On October 25, Globo and CONMEBOL reached an agreement and opted to terminate the arbitration in Switzerland, due to the termination of the contract in August 2020 for the broadcasting rights of the Copa Libertadores between 2019 and 2022. broadcaster may return to participate in negotiations regarding the broadcasting rights of the event between the years 2023 and 2026.

== Controversies ==
It has been popularly alleged that TV Globo&#x27;s absolute dominance in Brazilian television has allowed its proprietors to influence public opinion in the country, such as during the 1989 presidential campaign, when it broadcast an edited version of the candidates&#x27; debate favoring Fernando Collor de Mello to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Globo&#x27;s history and influence was chronicled in the 1993 British documentary &quot;Beyond Citizen Kane&quot;, which compared it to that of the fictional character Charles Foster Kane.

In 1994, &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot;, Globo&#x27;s nationwide television news show, was forced by the Superior Court of Justice to read a statement by then Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s governor, Leonel Brizola. The group was found guilty of defaming Brizola in a newspaper article and on television. The court granted Brizola the right to address a response on Globo&#x27;s &quot;Jornal Nacional&quot;, which had Cid Moreira to read Brizola&#x27;s response.

In 2016, Globo generated worldwide controversy when &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the network had replaced the winner of its &quot;Globeleza&quot; carnival pageant because she was deemed to be too &quot;black&quot;. The winner, Nayara Justino, had been selected after winning a vote on one of Brazil&#x27;s most popular TV shows. Globo denied any wrongdoing.

==Logo and identity==

Globo&#x27;s original logo was a stylized star, with shapes evoking the number 4—in reference to the channel number of its original station. In 1966, it was replaced by a circle with a mesh design; in 1969, after becoming a full network, the mesh circle was accompanied by seven interlocking circles in a horizontal row, representing Globo&#x27;s seven original affiliates. The current &quot;Globo&quot; logo, consisting of a globe, a cut-out representing a television screen, and a second globe within the &quot;screen&quot;, has been used in various forms since 1976, and was created by the German-born Austrian-Brazilian designer Hans Donner .

The original version, colored in blue and white, was replaced by a shaded metallic version in 1982. The following year, the same logo gained a three-dimensional version. In 1986, the logo adopted its longest-standing iteration, which rendered the two globes in silver, and fills the &quot;screen&quot; with a rainbow-colored gradient. The rainbow globe logo remained relatively unchanged through 2021, with changes limited to how the spheres and screen were rendered, such as in 2008 (when its shading became a less intricate &quot;chrome&quot;, and the screen cut-out was made rectangular to reflect the 16:9 aspect ratio and digital television), and in April 2014, where the metallic shading was replaced by a simpler white gloss, and a solid, two-dimensional version of the logo was used more frequently in marketing. Network staff stated that this version of the logo was intended to make it more &quot;alive&quot; and diverse, and make it better-suited for multi-platform use.

By 2021, as part of a wider reorganization of Globo&#x27;s media assets, Rede Globo had begun to phase in a rebranding to &quot;TV Globo&quot; (stylized in lowercase as &quot;tvglobo&quot;). TV Globo unveiled a revamped logo and identity in December 2021, developed by a team led by new chief art director Ricardo Moyano (who replaces the outgoing Donner). The three-dimensional version of Globo&#x27;s new logo carries a softer, shaded appearance, and replaces the rainbow motif with variants of the logos carrying different fluorescent color schemes (such as a light blue version with an orange and pink screen). The new branding was phased in across Globo&#x27;s on-air presentation and programming throughout 2022.

<text>John Edward Jacob (born 1934 in Trout, Louisiana) is a U.S. civil rights leader. He served as the president of the National Urban League between 1982 and 1994.

Jacob received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from Howard University and was a social worker in Baltimore before joining the Urban League. In 1965, he became director of education and youth incentives at the Washington, D.C. chapter. Later he served as president and executive director of the San Diego Urban League. In 1979 he became executive vice-president of the national office under Vernon Jordan, whom he succeeded as president.

During his tenure as Urban League president, Jacob fought cutbacks in federal social programs and the weakening of civil rights enforcement under the Reagan Administration. In particular, he objected to the appointment of a conservative majority to the Civil Rights Commission that was hostile to vigorous protection of civil rights, as well as the Justice Department&#x27;s prosecutions of other public agencies engaged in affirmative action.

==Urban Marshall Plan==

In the early 1980s, Jacob helped develop a plan for urban recovery similar to the 1947 Marshall Plan initiated to assist European nations after World War II. Aid was sought from private sectors to facilitate entry-level job training programs, and Jacob proposed the League give direct assistance from its own resources to poverty-stricken minorities and whites, including housing and job placement. In addition, he recommended the federal government institute full employment through substantial public works and job training programs, and along with other civil rights groups, supported economic pressure in the corporate world to develop markets and jobs for minorities.

The son of a Baptist minister, Jacob was also an adherent of self-help. He promoted SAT tutoring, comprehensive teenage pregnancy prevention, and a male responsibility program for fatherhood, to address issues contributing to the cycle of poverty in the African-American community. Jacob added voter registration, education, and drug control to the League&#x27;s agenda of priorities.

In contrast to Reagan, George H. W. Bush was initially receptive to Jacob&#x27;s domestic Marshall Plan proposal, and Jacob welcomed dialogue with the new administration. But Bush&#x27;s veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990 soured the relationship. The early 1990s also saw new court decisions and conservative political pressure against affirmative action policies the Urban League supported.

<doc id="772549" wikidata="Q4922750" url="?curid=772549" title="Blackburn Hundred">
<text>Blackburn Hundred (also known as Blackburnshire) is a historic sub-division of the county of Lancashire, in northern England. Its chief town was Blackburn, in the southwest of the hundred. It covered an area similar to modern East Lancashire, including the current districts of Ribble Valley (excluding the part north of the River Ribble and east of the Hodder, which was then in Yorkshire), Pendle (excluding West Craven, also in Yorkshire), Burnley, Rossendale, Hyndburn, Blackburn with Darwen, and South Ribble (east from Walton-le-dale and Lostock Hall).

Much of the area is hilly, bordering on the Pennines, with Pendle Hill in the midst of it, and was historically sparsely populated. It included several important royal forests. In the 18th century several towns in the area became industrialized and densely populated, including Blackburn itself, and Burnley.

==Early history==
The shire probably originated as a county of the Kingdom of Northumbria, but was much fought over. In the Domesday Book it was among the hundreds between the Ribble and Mersey rivers (&quot;Inter Ripam et Mersam&quot; in the Domesday Book) that were included with the information about Cheshire, though they are now in Lancashire and cannot be said clearly to have then been part of Cheshire. The area may have been annexed to the embryonic Kingdom of England following the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.

The Domesday Book entry shows that before the Norman conquest, the hundred had been held directly by King Edward. It mentions royal holdings in Blackburn, Huncoat, Walton-le-Dale and Pendleton, and those of a church at Blackburn and St Mary&#x27;s in Whalley. Also it talks of 28 freemen holding land as manors, but gives no further details about them. After the conquest Blackburnshire was part of a large area given to Roger de Poitou and he had demised it to Roger de Busli and Albert de Gresle.

Domesday also mentions a sizable area of woodland. Two areas, the first one league long and as wide, and another six long and four leagues wide, which could be as much as .

Later the much the east of the hundred was established as royal hunting grounds, Known as the forest of Blackburnshire it was divided into the four forests of Accrington, Pendle, Trawden and Rossendale.

==Feudal period==
At the start of the 12th century Roger de Poitou joined the failed rebellion against King Henry I in favor of his brother Robert Curthose, as a result losing his English holdings. In 1102 King Henry granted the whole of Blackburnshire and part of Amounderness to Robert de Lacy, the Lord of Pontefract, while confirming his possession of Bowland. These lands formed the basis of the Honour of Clitheroe.
Subsequently most of the ancient parish of Ribchester, except the township of Alston-with-Hothersall, and in the ancient parish of Chipping, the vills of Aighton and Dutton and part of the forest of Bowland belonging ecclesiastically to the ancient parish of Great Mitton were annexed to Blackburnshire.

The separateness of the district was reinforced when it became a royal bailiwick in 1122. In 1182, it became part of the newly created County Palatine of Lancaster.

By 1243 it is believed that there were 57 manors in the hundred.

Those held in demesne were Colne, Great and Little Marsden, Briercliffe, Burnley, Ightenhill, Habergham, Padiham, Huncoat, Hapton, Accrington, Haslingden, Downham, Worston, Chatburn and Little Pendleton.

Those held by thegnage were: Twiston, Chipping, Thornley, Wheatley, Ribchester, Dutton, Dinckley, Henthorn, Wilpshire, Clayton-le-Dale, Salesbury, Osbaldeston, Samlesbury, Read, Simonstone, Oswaldtwistle, Livesey, Birtwistle, Church, Cliviger and Worsthorne.

Those held by knight&#x27;s service were: Little Mitton, Wiswell, Hapton, Towneley, Coldcoats, Snodworth, Twiston, Extwistle, Aighton, Great Mearley, Livesey, Downham, Foulridge, Little Mearley, Rishton, Billington, Altham, Great Harwood, Clayton le Moors, and Walton in le Dale.

==Post medieval==

The hundred of Blackburnshire continued to have administrative relevance until the abandonment of the system of hundreds in the early 19th century, long after feudalism ceased in England. As in other parts of England, the hundred was divided into parishes which were ecclesiastical parishes as well as being used for administrative purposes, like modern English civil parishes.

Early Blackburnshire had only two parishes, each covering a considerable but sparsely populated area. Whalley (now a much smaller parish) was the larger of the two, and covered the east of the hundred, while Blackburn parish covered the west. As mentioned above, the hundred was expanded to cover parts of the parishes of Chipping, Ribchester and Mitton. As Blackburnshire became more heavily populated and economically developed, the parishes of Whalley and Blackburn were split into many smaller parts over the centuries.

*The ancient parish of Blackburn contained Blackburn, Little Harwood, Ramsgreave, Salesbury, Clayton-le-Dale, Mellor, Witton, Pleasington, Over Darwen, Lower Darwen, Eccleshill, Tockholes, Livesey, Walton-Le-Dale, Cuerdale, Samlesbury, Balderston, Osbaldeston, Billington, Wilpshire, Dinckley, Great Harwood, Rishton. It also included Yate and Pickup Bank with extra-parochial status.
*The ancient parish of Whalley contained Whalley, Clitheroe, Chatburn, Worston, Mearley, Bowland-with-Leagram, Mitton, Henthorn and Coldcoats, Pendleton with Pendleton Hall, Standen And Standen Hey (Standen was extra-parochial), Wiswell, Church, Oswaldtwistle, Huncoat, Altham, Clayton-Le-Moors, Old Accrington, New Accrington, Haslingden, Higher Booths, Lower Booths, Henheads, Newchurch in Pendle, Burnley, Habergham Eaves, Briercliffe with Extwistle, Worsthorne with Hurstwood, Cliviger, Ightenhill Park (extra-parochial), Reedley Hallows, Filly Close and New Laund Booth (extra-parochial), Padiham, Simonstone, Read, Hapton, Higham with West Close Booth, Heyhouses (extra-parochial), Dunnockshaw (extra-parochial), Goldshaw Booth, Barley-with-Wheatley Booth, Roughlee Booth, Wheatley Carr Booth (extra-parochial), Old Laund Booth, Colne, Marsden, Barrowford Booth, Foulridge, Trawden, Downham, and Twiston.

Blackburn became a separate archdeaconry, splitting off from the archdeaconry of Manchester, in 1877, and becoming the Diocese of Blackburn in 1926.

<text>Sam Boyd Stadium (formerly the Las Vegas Silver Bowl) is a closed football stadium in Whitney, Nevada, an unincorporated community in the Las Vegas Valley. It honors Sam Boyd (1910–1993), a major figure in the hotel and casino industry in Las Vegas. The stadium consisted of an uncovered horseshoe-shaped single-decked bowl, with temporary seating occasionally erected in the open north end zone. The artificial turf field had a conventional north–south orientation, at an elevation of above sea level.

It was the home field of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Rebels for 49 seasons, from 1971 through 2019; they moved to Allegiant Stadium in 2020. The annual Las Vegas Bowl took place at Sam Boyd in December from 1992 through 2019, and also moved to Allegiant. Sam Boyd was also used for high school football championship games and at times regular-season high school games for Bishop Gorman High School. 

A long time stop on the AMA Supercross Championship beginning in 1990, the final race of the season was located at the stadium every year. It also hosted the first 19 editions of the annual Monster Jam World Finals until 2018. 

From 2010 to 2019, it hosted the USA Sevens leg of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series in the sevens version of rugby union.

Several teams called the stadium home over the years, including the Las Vegas Quicksilvers of the North American Soccer League, the Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League, the Las Vegas Outlaws of the original XFL and the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.


==History==
Built at a cost of $3.5 million, the stadium debuted on October 23, 1971; its dedication game was the following season&#x27;s opener.

Originally known as Las Vegas Stadium, the name was changed to Las Vegas Silver Bowl in 1978, Sam Boyd Silver Bowl in 1984, and Sam Boyd Stadium on April 26, 1994. The original seating capacity was 15,000 through 1977, raised to 32,000 in 1978, and to 36,800 in 1999. Except from 1999 to 2002, the stadium has had an artificial turf surface. A $1.2 million renovation during the summer of 2015 replaced field turf that had not been changed out in more than a decade and was severely worn from usage. Additionally, two rows totaling 860 seats were removed from the east and west sidelines to widen the field and drop Sam Boyd&#x27;s capacity to 35,500.

In 2011, UNLV began exploring building a new stadium to replace Sam Boyd Stadium.

In 2017, it was announced that the Oakland Raiders would relocate to Las Vegas, and a new stadium, Allegiant Stadium began construction. The UNLV Rebels joined the Raiders at the new stadium in 2020.

In 2016, Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis had physically toured the stadium to assess the stadium as a possible temporary home if the team moved to Las Vegas. It was suggested that Sam Boyd Stadium could have served as a temporary home for the Raiders should fan support in Oakland fall to levels that could not reasonably be accommodated at the facility: the Los Angeles Chargers had come to a similar arrangement and played at the Dignity Health Sports Park, a stadium that is smaller than Sam Boyd Stadium, while in 1997, the Tennessee Oilers came to a similar arrangement in Memphis with Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium and in Nashville with Vanderbilt Stadium after their new stadium had delays in its construction.

A fall in fan support in Oakland did not occur, and the Raiders later signed a stadium lease for 2018: after looking at their options, a 2019 lease with a 2020 option in Oakland meant Sam Boyd Stadium was not required. In any event, the stadium would have required renovation to meet the NFL&#x27;s regulations to serve as a temporary home venue: since it would have been abandoned after the construction of Allegiant Stadium was completed, this would have been financially and logistically impractical.

On November 23, 2019, the Rebels defeated San Jose State 38–35 in their last game at the stadium. Four weeks later on December 21, the Washington Huskies defeated the Boise State Broncos 38–7 in the last Las Vegas Bowl held at the stadium.

The last scheduled non-football event of the 2019–2020 academic year was a Monster Jam show (which wasn&#x27;t the World Finals as it had been moved to Camping World Stadium in 2019) on March 21–22: this event was postponed for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually was canceled).

A professional development football league called The Spring League held several exhibition games at Sam Boyd Stadium in March 2020. In July 2020, the league announced plans for a four-team fall season (which would make the league&#x27;s name a misnomer) in October, 2020 with all games being held at Sam Boyd; however, the season was held at the San Antonio Alamodome instead.

Due to scheduling issues with the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium, UNLV moved its September 5, 2020 home game to Sam Boyd Stadium. That game was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

UNLV&#x27;s contract with Allegiant Stadium effectively prohibits the university from holding events at Sam Boyd Stadium in what is essentially a no-compete clause. In exchange for shutting down the stadium, UNLV receives annual compensation of up to $3.5 million over a 10-year period from the Raiders.

The exact future of the stadium remains up in the air, as UNLV officials are considering selling it, swapping it for a property closer to campus, demolishing it, or remodeling the stadium for secondary or high school use. After the opening of Allegiant Stadium, Sam Boyd Stadium was used for the 2021 UNLV commencement due to social distancing requirements; normally this is held at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. Clark County later purchased the stadium for $5 million, though no future plans have been announced.

==College football==

From 1992 through 2019, the stadium was the site of the annual Las Vegas Bowl. In the later years of the bowl game at the stadium, the game was very well attended. In 2005, Brigham Young University made its first postseason appearance since 2001 and excited BYU fans over-filled the stadium; the announced attendance was a record 40,053. The following season, BYU returned to the Las Vegas Bowl as a nationally ranked team. Additional seating was arranged at Sam Boyd Stadium for the 2006 game; the resulting attendance of 44,615 was the largest crowd to watch a team sports event in the history of the state of Nevada at that time. In 2007, BYU made its third straight appearance and attendance was 40,712. BYU made its fourth straight appearance 2008, ranked #16 in the nation and faced off against the Arizona Wildcats who made their first bowl appearance since 1998. Arizona won the contest, 31–21; 40,047 attended the game which featured David Hasselhoff singing the national anthem.

Sam Boyd Stadium was also the site of all three Western Athletic Conference title football games (1996–1998), and the Las Vegas All-American Classic postseason all-star game (2004–2006).

Due to restrictions set by their local governments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Mexico and San Jose State programs used the stadium as a temporary home field during the late stages of the 2020 season. The Spartans hosted the 2020 Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game against Boise State (which resulted in a 34-20 win for San Jose) in what is currently the stadium&#x27;s final scheduled event and was announced to the media final sporting event in Sam Boyd Stadium history.

==Professional football==
The stadium hosted the Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League in 1994, the Las Vegas Outlaws of the original XFL in 2001 and the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League from 2009 to 2011. On November 27, 2009, the Locomotives played the Florida Tuskers in the 2009 UFL Championship Game at Boyd, which the Locos won 20–17 in overtime. Sam Boyd Stadium was originally announced as the host for the 2019 and 2020 Alliance of American Football championship games, but the former was moved to Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas and the league later folded halfway through its 2019 season. The stadium also hosted The Spring League games in 2020.

==Soccer==
Following the 1976 season of the North American Soccer League, the San Diego Jaws decided to relocate and become the Las Vegas Quicksilvers. Despite a roster featuring international superstar Eusébio, the Quicksilvers could only manage an 11–15 record and a 5th-place finish in their division. They averaged an attendance of 7,092 per game. When the 1977 season ended, the franchise opted to move back to San Diego after only one year and became the San Diego Sockers. They were followed by the Las Vegas Seagulls, who played in the American Soccer League. They compiled a record of in their only season in 1979.

In 1999, the stadium hosted the CONCACAF Champions Cup tournament, which determined the continental champion of North and Central America. The stadium also hosted several Major League Soccer preseason exhibition matches. Spanish superclub Real Madrid defeated Mexico&#x27;s Santos Laguna 2–1 in a friendly match played on a temporary grass pitch in Sam Boyd Stadium in 2012. The paid attendance was 29,152, which made it the highest attended soccer match in Nevada history.

Sam Boyd Stadium hosted the inaugural Leagues Cup final between clubs of Major League Soccer and Liga MX on September 18, 2019. Cruz Azul won the final, defeating UANL 2–1.

===Finals===
==USA Sevens rugby==

The stadium hosted the USA Sevens rugby tournament every year from 2010 to 2019. The USA Sevens was the largest rugby tournament in North America, drawing over 60,000 fans in 2012. The tournament brought together over 15 national teams from six continents in rugby sevens as part of the World Rugby Sevens Series. The USA Sevens debuted in 2004 in Los Angeles and moved to San Diego in 2007. A temporary grass pitch was installed for the event each year through 2015. The March 2016 event was played on the artificial surface.

==Other events==
In 2010, Sam Boyd Stadium became the host of the Clark County High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame, including a 22 feet by 12 feet wall wrap with vintage photos of the inductees that will be displayed in the Southwest concourse of the stadium.

From 1990 until 2019, the final round of the AMA Supercross Championship was held at the venue. The final race at the stadium in 2020 will be the second to final round. Most of the track is located inside the stadium with extensions taken into the area behind the score board. This event also includes the Davey Coombs Sr. East/West Shootout which was first won by Kevin Windham in 1997. From 2011 until 2019, the Monster Energy Cup was held at the venue. Ryan Villopoto won the inaugural 2011 event as did Marvin Musquin in the 2017 event and Eli Tomac in 2018 event. Adam Cianciarulo won the final event at the stadium in 2019.

From 2000 to 2018, Sam Boyd Stadium hosted the Monster Jam World Finals in late March every year; the annual event has changed to rotating venues each year. The venue also hosted the inaugural Monster Jam All-Star Challenge from October 11-12, 2019. 

During the 1990s, The Grateful Dead played 14 shows at the stadium. The stadium and grounds hosted the two-day Vegoose music festival from 2005 to 2007.

In April 2018, the Las Vegas Horse Polo Classic was held at the stadium.

In February 2020, five Major League Rugby matches were played at the stadium over 2 weekends.

U2 played at the stadium multiple times, including during their ZooTV Tour on November 12, 1992, for the opening night of Popmart Tour on April 25, 1997 and during the 360º Tour on October 23, 2009 in front of 42,213 fans.

<doc id="772562" wikidata="Q3942616" url="?curid=772562" title="Rum Tum Tugger">
<text>Rum Tum Tugger is one of the many feline characters in the 1939 poetry book &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot; by T. S. Eliot, and in the 1981 musical &quot;Cats&quot; which is based on Eliot&#x27;s book. Rum Tum Tugger is a rebellious Jellicle cat who loves to be the center of attention.

The role of Rum Tum Tugger was originated by Paul Nicholas on the West End in 1981, and by Terrence Mann on Broadway in 1982. Then, in the 1998 video production, he was performed by John Partridge. Jason Derulo portrayed Rum Tum Tugger in the 2019 film adaptation.

==Origins==
In T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Old Possum&#x27;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;, Rum Tum Tugger is described as a rebel cat who cannot help but be difficult. He is never satisfied with what you give him;

:The Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat:
:If you offer him pheasant he would rather have grouse.
:If you put him in a house he would much prefer a flat,
:If you put him in a flat then he&#x27;d rather have a house.
:If you set him on a mouse then he only wants a rat,
:If you set him on a rat then he&#x27;d rather chase a mouse.
The Rum Tum Tugger is characterized as notoriously hard to please, constantly setting himself apart from others by deliberately doing the opposite of what is expected. By the end of the poem, the reader is left with the impression that he is deviously self-centered and takes pleasure in his contrarian nature. Performers playing this role are often described with the three words: &quot;perverse, preening, and independent.&quot;

==Musical==
===Character===
Rum Tum Tugger is a rebellious and unappeasable cat. He loves the limelight, while at the same time enjoys being seen as an individual by separating himself a little from the tribe. A ladies&#x27; man, the female kittens (Victoria, Etcetera, Electra and Jemima) are in awe of him, and he flirts openly with almost every female cat in the 1998 film adaptation (especially Bombalurina), although Demeter seems to dislike him deeply. He also admires Mr. Mistoffelees, even going so far as to sing a ballad about how talented he is. His older brother, the serious and responsible Munkustrap, often has to keep him in line.

Rum Tum Tugger is often portrayed as a rock star-esque cat, and Andrew Lloyd Webber has stated that part of the character is intended to be an homage to Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones. In an attempt to modernize the show, Rum Tum Tugger was revamped into a street rapper in the 2014 West End revival.

The role is usually played by a rock tenor with a strong falsetto register.

As a major character part, Tugger is a principal singing role with several solos. He sings solo in his own song, &quot;The Rum Tum Tugger&quot;, as well as &quot;Magical Mr. Mistoffelees&quot;. He sings &quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot; with Munkustrap.

===Appearance===
Rum Tum Tugger is a black tomcat with leopard spots on his chest and a wild mane; he wears a spiked collar and a belt covered with silver rhinestones. His cat breed was said to be Maine Coon, because of his wild mane and being portrayed as much bigger than the other cats.

===Notable casting===
The role of Rum Tum Tugger was originated by Paul Nicholas in the West End in 1981, and by Terrence Mann on Broadway in 1982. The character was played by Antoine Murray-Straughan and Marcquelle Ward in the 2014 and 2015 West End revivals respectively, and by Tyler Hanes in the 2016 Broadway revival.

On screen, he was played by John Partridge in the 1998 film adaptation, and by Jason Derulo in the 2019 film adaptation.

<doc id="772567" wikidata="Q3486226" url="?curid=772567" title="Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium">
<text>Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium is an outdoor college football stadium in the south central United States, located on the campus of the University of Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Commonly known as H. A. Chapman Stadium, it is the home field for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane of the American Athletic Conference.

The HA Chapman Stadium opened in 1930 and its current seating capacity is around 30,000 for football, following the renovation of 2008. The FieldTurf playing field has a traditional north-south alignment at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

== History ==
The 14,500-seat stadium opened in 1930 as Skelly Field, named for its primary benefactor, William Skelly, the founder of Skelly Oil. Tulsa defeated Arkansas 26–6 at the inaugural game on October 4.

In 1947, the north stands were added and the stadium was renamed Skelly Stadium. In 1965, the track was removed, the field was lowered, the west stands were expanded and the south stands were added, bringing the capacity to 40,385 seats. In February 2005, the north stands were demolished to make way for the new Case Athletic Complex, reducing the seating to 35,542. In 2007–2008, the stadium was renovated, reducing capacity to 30,000 

Located on historic U.S. Route 66, the stadium hosted the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League (USFL) in 1984. Skelly was once the principal home field for two American football legends – future NFL Hall-of-Famer (and later U.S. Congressman) Steve Largent when he played for the University of Tulsa and Doug Williams of the Oklahoma Outlaws, who later was a Super Bowl MVP for the Washington Redskins. The stadium was also home to the Tulsa Roughnecks of the North American Soccer League 1978–1984 and the short-lived Tulsa Mustangs of the AFA.

On April 26, 2007, it was reported that, with a renovation project underway, the stadium was renamed as Skelly Field at H. A. Chapman Stadium after the primary benefactor of the renovation.

The stadium is also used for the Jenks–Union football rivalry games.

==Attendance==
The stadium&#x27;s attendance record was established in 1987, when 47,350 watched top-ranked Oklahoma shut out Tulsa 65–0 on September 26.

===Top ten single-game attendances===
===Largest season attendance average===
The highest attendance average in a season was 31,236 in 1991 with 7 games.
==Wins==

===Tulsa&#x27;s Victories at Skelly Field===
==Renovation==

The stadium was renovated following the 2007 season. The project included new seating, a new pressbox, club and loge seating, and a new scoreboard. With the removal of the upper section of the west stands, seating capacity dropped to approximately 30,000, which made Chapman Stadium the smallest stadium in Conference USA.

<doc id="772572" wikidata="Q377458" url="?curid=772572" title="Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor">
<text>Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), also known as coxibs, are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that directly target cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme responsible for inflammation and pain. Targeting selectivity for COX-2 reduces the risk of peptic ulceration and is the main feature of celecoxib, rofecoxib, and other members of this drug class. 

After several COX-2–inhibiting drugs were approved for marketing, data from clinical trials revealed that COX-2 inhibitors caused a significant increase in heart attacks and strokes, with some drugs in the class having worse risks than others. Rofecoxib (sold under the brand name Vioxx) was taken off the market in 2004 because of these concerns, while celecoxib (sold under the brand name Celebrex) and traditional NSAIDs received boxed warnings on their labels. Many COX-2–specific inhibitors have been removed from the US market. As of December 2011, only Celebrex (celecoxib) is still available for purchase in the United States. In the European Union, celecoxib, parecoxib, and etoricoxib have been approved for use by the European Medicines Agency.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) inhibits COX-2 almost exclusively within the brain and only minimally in the rest of the body, although it is not considered an NSAID, since it has only minor anti-inflammatory activity.

== Medical uses ==
Some COX-2 inhibitors are used in a single dose to treat pain after surgery. In this role etoricoxib appears as good as, if not better than, other pain medications, and celecoxib appears to be about as useful as ibuprofen.

NSAIDs are often used in treatment of acute gout attacks. COX-2 inhibitors appear to work as well as nonselective NSAIDs, such as aspirin. They have not been compared to other treatment options such as colchicine or glucocorticoids.

=== Cancer ===
COX-2 appears to be related to cancers and abnormal growths in the intestinal tract. Overexpression of COX-2 produces excess prostaglandins, which have been shown to increase the possibility of colorectal cancer. COX inhibitors have been shown to reduce the occurrence of cancers and precancerous growths. The National Cancer Institute has done some studies on COX-2 and cancer. COX-2 can act as an anti-tumor enzyme, but only in specific cases. The FDA has approved Celebrex for treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). COX-2 inhibitors are currently being studied in breast cancer and appear to be beneficial.

=== Neuropsychiatric disorders ===

COX-2 inhibitors have been found to be effective in suppressing inflammatory neurodegenerative pathways, with beneficial results in animal studies for major depressive disorder, as well as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These need to be confirmed in human clinical trials. Current studies support an association of disorders such as these with chronic inflammation, which appears to decrease with the use of COX-2 inhibitors.

=== Other targets ===

The inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. However, with regard to this drug&#x27;s promise for the therapy of advanced cancers, it is unclear whether the inhibition of COX-2 plays a dominant role, and this has become a controversial and intensely researched issue. In recent years, several additional intracellular components (besides COX-2) were discovered that appear to be important for mediating the anticancer effects of celecoxib in the absence of COX-2. Moreover, a recent study with various malignant tumor cells showed that celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells, even though some of these cancer cells didn&#x27;t even contain COX-2.

Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib&#x27;s anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen analogs of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their chemical structures. Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others didn&#x27;t. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in cell culture was investigated, it turned out that the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing that inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects. One of these compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually turned out to display stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib itself and this anticancer effect could also be verified in highly drug-resistant tumor cells and in various animal tumor models.

=== Adverse effects ===
Analysis of clinical trial data revealed that there was a significant increase in the rate of vascular events like myocardial infarction or stroke with COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo. These results led Merck to voluntarily withdraw (rofecoxib) from the market in September 2004 and to regulatory authorities imposing a boxed warning on the label of celecoxib. Traditional NSAIDs were also found to have cardiovascular risks, leading to similar boxed warnings.

The cause of the cardiovascular problems became, and remains, a subject of intensive research. As of 2012 results have been converging on the hypothesis that the adverse cardiovascular effects are most likely due to inhibition of COX-2 in blood vessels, which leads to a decrease in the production of prostacyclin in them. Prostacyclin usually prevents platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, so its inhibition can lead to excess clot formation and higher blood pressure.

== Research ==

=== Research history ===
The COX-2 enzyme was discovered in 1988 by Daniel Simmons, a Brigham Young University researcher. The mouse COX-2 gene was cloned by UCLA scientist Harvey Herschman, a finding published in 1991.

The basic research leading to the discovery of COX-2 inhibitors has been the subject of at least two lawsuits. Brigham Young University has sued Pfizer, alleging breach of contract from relations BYU had with the company at the time of Simmons&#x27;s work. A settlement was reached in April 2012 in which Pfizer agreed to pay $450 million. The other litigation is based on United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 owned by University of Rochester, which claimed a method to treat pain without causing gastro-intestinal distress by selectively inhibiting COX-2. When the patent issued, the university sued Searle (later Pfizer) in a case called, &quot;University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle &amp; Co.&quot;, 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.

In the course of the search for a specific inhibitor of the negative effects of prostaglandins that spared the positive effects, it was discovered that prostaglandins could indeed be separated into two general classes that could loosely be regarded as &quot;good prostaglandins&quot; and &quot;bad prostaglandins&quot;, according to the structure of a particular enzyme involved in their biosynthesis, cyclooxygenase.

Prostaglandins whose synthesis involves the cyclooxygenase-I enzyme, or COX-1, are responsible for maintenance and protection of the gastrointestinal tract, while prostaglandins whose synthesis involves the cyclooxygenase-II enzyme, or COX-2, are responsible for inflammation and pain.

The existing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) differ in their relative specificities for COX-2 and COX-1; while aspirin and ibuprofen inhibit COX-2 and COX-1 enzymes, other NSAIDs appear to have partial COX-2 specificity, particularly meloxicam (Mobic). Aspirin is ≈170-fold more potent in inhibiting COX-1 than COX-2. Studies of meloxicam 7.5 mg per day for 23 days find a level of gastric injury similar to that of a placebo, and for meloxicam 15 mg per day a level of injury lower than that of other NSAIDs; however, in clinical practice meloxicam can still cause some ulcer complications.

Valdecoxib and rofecoxib were about 300 times more potent at inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1, but too toxic for the heart, suggesting the possibility of relief from pain and inflammation without gastrointestinal irritation, and promising to be a boon for those who had previously experienced adverse effects or had comorbidities that could lead to such complications. Celecoxib is approximately 30 times more potent at inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1, with etoricoxib being 106 times more potent.

=== Research fraud ===
Between 1996 and 2009, Scott Reuben purportedly conducted clinical research on the use of COX-2 inhibitors, often in combination with gabapentin or pregabalin, for the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain, research which was found in 2009 to have been faked. Reuben pleaded guilty, paid fines, and served six months in jail, and lost his medical license. A 2009 review of meta-articles used in evidence-based medicine found that while some reviews were no longer valid when the Reuben studies were removed, the conclusions in the majority of them remained unchanged. The review found that the key Reuben claims that needed to be re-examined were &quot;the absence of detrimental effects of coxibs on bone healing after spine surgery, the beneficial long-term outcome after preemptive administration of coxibs including an allegedly decreased incidence of chronic pain after surgery, and the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac or clonidine when added to local anesthetics for intravenous regional anesthesia.&quot;

=== Early COX-2-inhibiting drugs ===
Celebrex (and other brand names for celecoxib) was introduced in 1999 and rapidly became the most frequently prescribed new drug in the United States. By October 2000, its US sales exceeded 100 million prescriptions per year for $3 billion, and was still rising. Sales of Celebrex alone reached $3.1 billion in 2001. A Spanish study found that between January 2000 and June 2001, 7% of NSAID prescriptions and 29% of NSAID expenditures were for COX-2 inhibitors. Over the period of the study, COX-2 inhibitors rose from 10.03% of total NSAIDs prescribed by specialty physicians to 29.79%, and from 1.52% to 10.78% of NSAIDs prescribed by primary care physicians (98.23% of NSAIDs and 94.61% of COX-2 inhibitors were prescribed by primary care physicians). For specialty physicians, rofecoxib and celecoxib were third and fifth most frequently prescribed NSAIDs but first and second in cost, respectively; for primary-care physicians they were ninth and twelfth most frequently prescribed NSAIDs and first and fourth in cost.

Sales and marketing efforts were supported by two large trials, the Celecoxib Long-term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS) in &quot;JAMA&quot;, and the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR). The VIGOR trial was later proven to have been based on faulty data, and Vioxx was eventually withdrawn from the market.

==== VIGOR study and publishing controversy ====

The VIGOR (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research) trial, &quot;which was the making of Merck&#x27;s drug rofecoxib (Vioxx),&quot; was at the center of a dispute about the ethics of medical journals. In the VIGOR trial, over 8,000 patients were randomized to receive either naproxen or rofecoxib (Vioxx). Both studies concluded that COX-2 specific NSAIDs were associated with significantly fewer adverse gastrointestinal effects. In the CLASS trial which compared Celebrex 800 mg/day to ibuprofen 2400 mg/day and diclofenac 150 mg/day for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis for six months, Celebrex was associated with significantly fewer upper gastrointestinal complications (0.44% vs. 1.27%, &quot;p&quot; = 0.04), with no significant difference in incidence of cardiovascular events in patients not taking aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

The VIGOR trial results were published in 2000 in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; Bombardier and her research team claimed that there was &quot;an increase in myocardial infarction in the patients given rofecoxib (0.4%) compared with those given naproxen (0.1%)&quot; and &quot;patients given naproxen experienced 121 side effects compared with 56 in the patients taking rofecoxib,&quot; a &quot;marvellous result for Merck&quot; which &quot;contributed to huge sales of rofecoxib.&quot; Merck&#x27;s scientists incorrectly interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks &quot;is primarily due to&quot; this protective effect. In September 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, &quot;Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).&quot; This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). By 2005 &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published an editorial accusing the Bombardier et al. of deliberately withholding data.

Claire Bombardier, a University of Toronto rheumatologist, had claimed that the VIGOR trial showed that Vioxx 50 mg/day had benefits over naproxen for rheumatoid arthritis, specifically that Vioxx reduced the risk of symptomatic ulcers and clinical upper gastrointestinal events (perforations, obstructions and bleeding) by 54%, to 1.4% from 3%, the risk of complicated upper gastrointestinal events (complicated perforations, obstructions and bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract) by 57%, and the risk of bleeding from anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract by 62%. An enormous marketing effort capitalized on these publications; Vioxx was the most heavily advertised prescription drug in 2000, and Celebrex the seventh, according to IMS Health.

=== Neuroblastomas ===
Small tumors of the sympathetic nervous system (neuroblastoma) appear to have abnormal levels of COX-2 expressed. These studies report that overexpression of the COX-2 enzyme has an adverse effect on the tumor suppressor, p53. p53 is an apoptosis transcription factor normally found in the cytosol. When cellular DNA is damaged beyond repair, p53 is transported to the nucleus where it promotes p53 mediated apoptosis. Two of the metabolites of COX-2, prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) and A1 (PGA1), when present in high quantities, bind to p53 in the cytosol and inhibit its ability to cross into the nucleus. This essentially sequesters p53 in the cytosol and prevents apoptosis. Coxibs such as Celebrex (celecoxib), by selectively inhibiting the overexpressed COX-2, allow p53 to work properly. Functional p53 allows DNA damaged neuroblastoma cells to commit suicide through apoptosis, halting tumor growth.

COX-2 up-regulation has also been linked to the phosphorylation and activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2, a protein that mediates p53 ligation and tagged destruction, through ubiquitination. The mechanism for this neuroblastoma HDM2 hyperactivity is unknown. Studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors block the phosphorylation of HDM2 preventing its activation. In vitro, the use of COX-2 inhibitors lowers the level of active HDM2 found in neuroblastoma cells. The exact process of how COX-2 inhibitors block HDM2 phosphorylation is unknown, but this mediated reduction in active HDM2 concentration level restores the cellular p53 levels. After treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor, the restored p53 function allows DNA damaged neuroblastoma cells to commit suicide through apoptosis reducing the size of growth of the tumor.

<text>Catherine Nyambura Ndereba (born 21 July 1972) is a retired Kenyan marathon runner. Between 2003 and 2008, she finished in the top two in five successive global championship marathons. Ndereba has twice won the marathon at the World Championships in Athletics and won silver medals at the Summer Olympic Games in 2004 and 2008, becoming Kenya&#x27;s first female multi-medalist. She is also a four-time winner of the Boston Marathon and a two-time winner of the Chicago Marathon. It was at the latter in 2001 that she broke the women&#x27;s marathon world record with a time of 2:18:47.

In 2008, Ndereba was described by &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sportswriter Philip Hersh as the greatest women&#x27;s marathoner of all time.

==Career==
Catherine Ndereba comes from Gatunganga in Nyeri District, and went to Ngorano Secondary School where she pursued her running career.

She was awarded the Order of the Golden Warrior by President Mwai Kibaki in 2005.

Ndereba finished seventh at the 2009 London Marathon, equalling Katrin Dorre&#x27;s record of 21 sub-2:30 hours marathons. She placed third at the Yokohama Women&#x27;s Marathon later that year, finishing the course in a time of 2:29:13 hours. She did not finish another marathon race until October 2011, when she crossed the line in 2:30:14 hours for third at the Beijing Marathon.

<doc id="772580" wikidata="Q2790698" url="?curid=772580" title="Heritage Bank Center">
<text>Heritage Bank Center is an indoor arena in downtown Cincinnati, adjacent to Great American Ball Park. It was completed in September 1975 and named Riverfront Coliseum because of its placement next to Riverfront Stadium. In 1997, the facility became known as The Crown, and in 1999, it changed its name again to Firstar Center after Firstar Bank assumed naming rights. In 2002, following Firstar&#x27;s merger with U.S. Bank, the arena took on the name U.S. Bank Arena and kept that name until 2019.

The arena seats 17,556 people and is the largest indoor arena in the Greater Cincinnati region with of space. The arena underwent a $14 million renovation project in 1997. The current main tenant is the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL.

==History==
The arena was the home of the Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey Association from 1975 to 1979. Since then, the arena has hosted two minor league hockey teams and various concerts, political rallies, tennis tournaments, figure skating, professional wrestling, traveling circus and rodeo shows, and other events. The facility&#x27;s longest-serving tenant was the Cincinnati Bearcats men&#x27;s basketball program of the University of Cincinnati, who used the arena from its construction until 1987, when the team moved to Cincinnati Gardens and eventually to the on-campus Fifth Third Arena.

Until the opening of Fifth Third Arena at the University of Cincinnati and Truist Arena at Northern Kentucky University, commencement ceremonies for both schools were held at Heritage Bank Center. On occasion, there have been local pushes for the attraction of another major sports franchise to occupy the arena, possibly a National Basketball Association (NBA) or National Hockey League (NHL) franchise. The Cincinnati Royals moved to Kansas City – Omaha in 1972, and were the last NBA team to call Cincinnati home. The NBA Cleveland Cavaliers have played preseason games at Heritage Bank Center.

In August 2019, it was announced that U.S. Bank would not be renewing its naming rights sponsorship of the arena, which had been in effect since 2002. Kentucky-based Heritage Bank assumed naming rights of the arena on November 4, 2019.

===Owners===
* Brian and Albert Heekin (1975–1997)
* Cincinnati Entertainment Associates (1997–2001)
* Nederlander Entertainment (2001–present)
* Anschutz Entertainment Group (2011–present)

==Renovations==
The arena was renovated in 1997 as part of the facility&#x27;s purchase that year by a group headed by Doug Kirchhofer, owner of the Cincinnati Cyclones. The renovation cost $14 million and included new seating, improved concourses and restrooms, expanded concession areas, and a new center-hanging video board. As part of the renovation, the building was renamed &quot;The Crown&quot; and the Cyclones, who then played in the International Hockey League, moved from the Cincinnati Gardens.

A $200 million renovation was proposed in 2015 by arena owners Nederlander Entertainment and AEG Facilities. The renovations would include both upgrades to the seating and expansion to increase capacity to 18,500 seats, additional luxury suites and other premium seating, a new exterior facade, new video boards, and a renovation of the exterior concourse. 
The push for extensive renovations and upgrades came in 2014 after the city ran a bid for the 2016 Republican National Convention, which was unsuccessful due to the lack of adequate hotel rooms and infrastructure in the proximity of the Arena.

In 2017, Nederlander Entertainment announced its intention to tear down and replace the arena if a deal could be made with taxpayers, citing inadequate space and dated &#x27;70s aesthetics. This plan came after the Arena was awarded to be a site for the 2022 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, contingent upon updates to the venue. However, after little progress was made the NCAA decided in late 2019 to move the site of the games to Indianapolis.

==Sporting events==

===Basketball===

The Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association played 14 games at the newly opened arena for their 1975–1976 season before the team folded due to the ABA–NBA merger following the season.

Cincinnati Bearcats men&#x27;s basketball utilized Riverfront Coliseum as their home court from 1976 to 1987. During the Bearcats&#x27; tenancy the venue hosted the 1978 and 1983 Metro Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

Additional conference tournaments hosted here was the finals of the 1981 and the entire 1992 Midwestern Collegiate Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament as well as the 2005 and 2006 Atlantic 10 men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In these instances, Xavier served as the host for the conference tournaments.

The 2002 and 2004 Conference USA men&#x27;s basketball tournament were also hosted at the venue, in these instances with Cincinnati serving as the host for the conference tournaments.

The arena was the site of the Regional of the 1979 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament and 1987 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament, as well as a first and second round site for the 1988 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1992 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament. The arena was also host to the 1997 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament Final Four.

In the aftermath of the 2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl, Cincinnati and Xavier agreed to move the Crosstown Shootout to the arena for the next two seasons. After the 2013 game, the Shootout returned to being played on campus.

====Regular season college basketball games====
&quot;This table does not include regular season games played by Cincinnati, when the team utilized Riverfront Coliseum as their home court from 1976 to 1987.&quot;

===Hockey===

The first tenant of the arena was the Cincinnati Stingers franchise, which existed from 1975 to 1979 as an expansion team of the World Hockey Association. Despite moderate success, the Stingers did not survive the NHL–WHA merger in 1979 and the team ceased operations. A handful of minor league hockey franchises have called the arena home, with the most successful and longest standing being the Cincinnati Cyclones. As of 2020, the Cyclones are the only active tenant of the venue.

The arena has played host to a handful of college hockey events, including the 1996 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament Frozen Four, which was won by Michigan. The site also hosted the regional games for the 2014, 2016, and 2017 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament. In each instance, Miami (OH) served as the host for the regional games.

==Concerts==
The first entertainment event (opening night) to be staged at the facility was a rock concert by The Allman Brothers Band and special guest Muddy Waters on the &quot;Win, Lose Or Draw Tour&quot; on September 9, 1975, attended by 16,721 persons.

On June 25, 1977, Elvis Presley gave his second-to-last concert at the Riverfront Coliseum, with 17,140 persons attending.

In 1979, The Bee Gees played two sold-out shows during their &quot;Spirits Having Flown Tour&quot;.

On March 28, 2010, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift performed a sold-out show at the venue during her &quot;Fearless Tour&quot;.

On October 22, 2019, musical duo Twenty One Pilots performed as part of their &quot; Bandito Fall Tour&quot; 2019.

On October 24, 2019, Canadian singer Celine Dion performed a show during her &quot;Courage World Tour&quot;. She had performed at the venue previously when the facility was named &quot;The Crown&quot;, as part of her &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love Tour&quot;, on September 19, 1998. 

On August 24, 2022, My Chemical Romance performed a sold-out show at the venue as part of their Reunion Tour.

Multiple other artists and groups have performed at the venue, including Paul McCartney, The Eagles, Elton John, gospel music artist Ron Kenoly, and several performances of Handel&#x27;s Messiah.

===1979 The Who concert deaths===

On December 3, 1979, 11 teenagers and young adults were killed by compressive asphyxia, and 26 others were injured, during a crowd crush caused by a rush for the best seats before the start of a sold-out concert by English rock band The Who. On that evening, a total of 18,348 ticketed fans were attending, which included 14,770 in general admission seats. The concert was using festival seating, where seats were made available on a first-come, first-served basis. When the fans waiting outside the Coliseum could hear the band conducting a late sound-check, they incorrectly presumed that the concert was beginning without them and tried to break through the still-locked venue doors. Some people (at the very front of the crowd) were either trampled underfoot or squeezed to the point of suffocation while standing, as the crowds pushing from behind were unaware that the doors were still closed. Only a few doors were in operation that night, and there were reports that management did not open more doors due to union restrictions and the concern of people gate-crashing the ticket turnstiles.

As a result, the remaining concerts scheduled for 1979, namely Blue Öyster Cult on December 14 and Aerosmith on December 21, were canceled, and concert venues across North America switched to reserved seating or changed their rules about festival seating. Cincinnati immediately outlawed festival seating at concerts. After establishment of a crowd control task force by Cincinnati mayor Ken Blackwell, the first concert held at the facility after the tragedy was ZZ Top with the Rockets on March 21, 1980, on ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Expect No Quarter Tour&quot;.

On August 4, 2004, the Cincinnati City Council unanimously overturned the ban on festival seating because it placed the city at a disadvantage for booking concerts. Many music acts prefer festival seating because it can allow the most enthusiastic fans to get near the stage and generate excitement for the rest of the crowd. The city had previously made a one-time exception to the ban, allowing festival seating for a Bruce Springsteen concert on November 12, 2002. Cincinnati was, for a time, the only city in the United States to outlaw festival seating altogether.

<doc id="772590" wikidata="Q178477" url="?curid=772590" title="World's Finest Comics">
<text>World&#x27;s Finest Comics is an American comic book series published by DC Comics from 1941 to 1986. The series was initially titled World&#x27;s Best Comics for its first issue; issue #2 (Summer 1941) switched to the more familiar name. Michael E. Uslan has speculated that this was because DC received a cease and desist letter from Better Publications, Inc., who had been publishing a comic book entitled &quot;Best Comics&quot; since November 1939. Virtually every issue featured DC&#x27;s two leading superheroes, Superman and Batman, with the earliest issues also featuring Batman&#x27;s sidekick, Robin.

==Publication history==
The idea for &quot;World&#x27;s Best Comics&quot; #1 originated from the identically formatted 1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair Comics featuring Superman, Batman, and Robin with 96 pages and a cardboard cover. The year before there was a similar 1939 &quot;New York World&#x27;s Fair Comics&quot; featuring Superman but without Batman and Robin because Bob Kane and Bill Finger had not yet created them.

The series was initially a 96-page quarterly anthology, featuring various DC characters – always including Superman and Batman – in separate stories. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;pairing Superman and Batman made sense financially, since the two were DC&#x27;s most popular heroes&quot;. When superheroes fell out of vogue in the early 1950s, DC shortened the size of the publication to that of the rest of its output, leaving only enough space for one story; this led to Superman and Batman appearing in the same story together starting with &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #71 (July 1954). The title often depicted Batman gaining superpowers as a way to avoid having him be overshadowed by Superman. Lex Luthor and the Joker first joined forces in issue #88 (June 1957). A new supervillain, the Composite Superman, was introduced in #142 (June 1964). The story &quot;The Clash of Cape and Cowl&quot;, by writer Edmond Hamilton and artist Curt Swan, in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #153 (Nov. 1965) is the source of an Internet meme in which Batman slaps Robin. Noted Batman artist Neal Adams first drew the character in an interior story in &quot;The Superman-Batman Revenge Squads&quot; in issue #175 (May 1968).

The title briefly featured Superman teaming with heroes other than Batman in the early 1970s beginning with issue #198 (November 1970). That issue featured the first part of a two-issue team-up with the Flash. Other characters to appear in the next two years included Robin, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, the Teen Titans, Doctor Fate, Hawkman, Green Arrow, the Martian Manhunter, the Atom, and the Vigilante. Nick Cardy was the cover artist for &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; for issues #212–228. Metamorpho was the backup feature in issues #218–220 and #229 after the character had a brief run as the backup in &quot;Action Comics&quot;.

The series reverted to Superman and Batman team-ups after issue #214, initially with a unique twist, featuring the children they might one day have: Superman Jr. and Batman Jr. These characters, billed as the Super-Sons, were co-created by writer Bob Haney and artist Dick Dillin in issue #215 (January 1973). Super-Sons stories alternated with tales of the original Superman and Batman through issue #263, with issues #215–216, 221–222, 224, 228, 230, 231, 233, 238, 242, and 263 featuring the sons. Haney frequently disregarded continuity by scripting stories which contradicted DC&#x27;s canon or by writing major heroes in an out-of-character fashion. He introduced Batman&#x27;s older brother, Thomas Wayne Jr., in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #223 (May–June 1974). This story was used as a basis for a plot detail in the &quot;Court of Owls&quot; story arc in 2012. Issues #223 (May–June 1974) to #228 (March–April 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.

With issue #244 (April–May 1977), &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; became one of the first 80-page Dollar Comics. It featured the Superman and Batman team with back-up features. The number of pages was reduced from 80 to 64 starting with issue #253 (October–November 1978) and reduced to 48 pages with issue #266 (December 1980 – January 1981) which lasted until issue #282 (August 1982).

Issue #250 (April–May 1978) combined Superman and Batman with the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, and Wonder Woman into the World&#x27;s Finest Team in a 56-page story. Writer Roy Thomas wrote a book-length story for issue #271 (September 1981) which pieced together all the &quot;first meetings&quot; of Superman and Batman. This issue did not have any backup features. The Hawkman story &quot;Drive Me to the Moon!&quot; in #272 (October 1981) featured Hawkgirl changing her title to Hawkwoman. As of issue #283 (September 1982), the series reverted to a standard format title again featuring only Superman and Batman team-ups, which continued until the series&#x27; cancellation with issue #323 (January 1986). The series reached issue #300 in February 1984. This double-sized anniversary issue was a &quot;jam&quot; featuring a story by writers David Anthony Kraft, Mike W. Barr, and Marv Wolfman with art by Ross Andru, Mark Texeira, Sal Amendola, and George Pérez. David Mazzucchelli, the artist of the &quot;&quot; story arc in 1987, first drew Batman in a backup story in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #302 (April 1984). Issue #314 (April 1985) was the last Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; issue and the first &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; appearances of the Monitor and (Lyla) the Harbinger. The series ended with issue #323 (January 1986) by writer Joey Cavalieri and artist José Delbo.

<text>The Little School is a novel written by Alicia Partnoy, a woman who was &quot;disappeared&quot; during the Dirty War period of the history of Argentina. It is an account of a clandestine detention center. She tells of all the people that she met and saw through a tiny hole in her blindfold. The guards made sure prisoners of The Little School did not talk with each other or see each other. Prisoners were beaten and tortured for almost any reason and many were killed.

Military regimes are not at all unusual in Argentina but those that ruled from 1976 to 1979 were unique in the number of civilians, mostly young people, who were kidnapped, jailed, tortured, and/or murdered because of their political beliefs. Early in 1977 the author was taken into custody by the army and sent to &quot;the little school,&quot; one of many camps where dissidents were &quot;taught&quot; their &quot;lessons&quot;. Imprisoned without charges, she spent almost a year blindfolded and bound, cut off from friends and family, including her child, until being inexplicably released. Partnoy&#x27;s glimpses of her life in prison are understandably disjointed and meandering, but they stand as a record of character and fortitude.

It is the small details that make these stories so heartbreaking. A child&#x27;s nursery rhyme that runs endlessly through the mind of one prisoner while being tortured. A friend&#x27;s jacket that shields the guard&#x27;s blows once that friend is removed from the school, possibly killed. A broken tooth kept in a matchbox that reminds one prisoner she is still &quot;whole.&quot; The glimpses of life another prisoner catches through the bottom of the blindfold, where it doesn&#x27;t quite lay flat against her cheeks. The sheer delight in catching raindrops in the palm of a hand where the window leaks during a storm.

<text>Salah Jadid (; 1926 – 19 August 1993) was a Syrian military officer and politician who was the leader of the far-left bloc of the Syrian Regional Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Ba&#x27;athist Syria from 1966 until 1970, when he was ousted by Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s Corrective Movement.

==Early life and career==
Jadid was born in 1926 in the village of Dweir Baabda, near the coastal city of Jableh, to an Alawite family of the Haddadin tribe. Another report states his birth year as 1924. He studied at the Homs Military Academy, and entered the Syrian Army in 1946. Jadid was originally a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), but later became a member of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar, in the 1950s through an associate of Akram al-Hawrani. Even so, Jadid remained close to the SSNP; his brother, Ghassan, was one of its most prominent members in Syria. He changed allegiance again in the 1950s, when he became a member of the Arab Nationalist Movement, a party supporting Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s ideological beliefs. Jadid supported Syria&#x27;s ascension into the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union republic consisting of Egypt and Syria.

During the UAR-era, Jadid was stationed in Cairo, Egypt. Jadid established the Military Committee alongside other Ba&#x27;athists in 1959. The chief aim of the Military Committee was to protect the UAR&#x27;s existence. In the beginning there were only four members of the Military Committee, the others were Hafez al-Assad, Abd al-Karim al-Jundi and Muhammad Umran. The Military Committee also tried to save the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath movement from annihilation. Committee members were among those who blamed Aflaq for the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s failing during the UAR years. The party&#x27;s Third National Congress in 1959 supported Aflaq&#x27;s decision to dissolve the party, but a 1960 National Congress, in which Jadid was a delegate representing the then-unknown Military Committee, reversed the decision and called for the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s reestablishment. The Congress also decided to improve relations with Nasser by democratising the UAR from within. A faction within the party, led by al-Hawrani, called for Syria&#x27;s secession. The Military Committee did not succeed in its aims, and in September 1961 the UAR was dissolved. Nazim al-Kudsi, who led the first post-UAR government, persecuted Jadid and the others for their Nasserite loyalties, and all of them were forced to retire from the Syrian Army.

In 1963 Jadid was promoted from Lieutenant colonel to Major general and named Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Syria.
==Strongman of Ba&#x27;athist Syria==
Salah Jadid came to power after a military coup in 1966, in which he was a leading figure. The coup was due to strong ideological differences between the Military Committee and the National Command of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, whose unity had almost collapsed shortly after the seizure of power in 1963. A new coup overthrew the National Command and ousted the Aflaqites from power (and sent Michel Aflaq into exile).

While Jadid remained away from public view, as the second secretary of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, men allied to him filled the top posts in state and army: Nureddin al-Atassi, as party chairman, state president and later prime minister; Yousuf Zouayyen, as prime minister; Ibrahim Makhous as foreign minister, Hafez al-Assad as defense minister; Abd al-Karim al-Jundi, as security chief. Many of these men were Alawis (e.g. all of the above except Atassi, Jundi, and Zouayyen, who were Sunni, giving the government a sectarian character. Several were military men, and all belonged to the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s left-wing.

Under Jadid&#x27;s rule, Syria aligned itself with the Soviet bloc and pursued hardline policies towards Israel and &quot;reactionary&quot; Arab states especially Saudi Arabia, calling for the mobilization of a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; against Zionism rather than inter-Arab military alliances. Domestically, Jadid attempted a socialist transformation of Syrian society at a forced pace, creating unrest and economic difficulties. Opponents of the government were harshly suppressed by Jadid&#x27;s special services and Mukhabarat, while the Ba&#x27;ath Party replaced parliament as law-making body and other parties were banned. Public support for his government, such as it was, declined sharply following Syria&#x27;s defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel captured the Golan Heights, and as a result of the troubled internal conditions of the country.

After the war, in particular, tensions began to increase between Jadid&#x27;s followers and those who argued that the situation called for a more moderate stance on socialism and international relations. This group coalesced around Defense Minister Hafez al-Assad, who protested the &quot;adventurism&quot; of Jadid, and demanded a normalization of the internal situation by adopting a permanent constitution, liberalizing the economy, and mending ties with non-Ba&#x27;athist groups, as well as the external situation, by seeking an alliance with conservative Arab states such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. While Jadid retained the allegiance of most of the civilian Ba&#x27;ath apparatus, Assad as defense minister gradually asserted control over the military wing of the party. In 1969, Assad purged several Jadid loyalists, and from that point on Jadid had lost his preeminence in the state.

==Downfall and death==
In 1970, when conflict erupted between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian army, Jadid sent Syrian-controlled Palestinian troops of the nominally PLO-run Palestine Liberation Army, based in Syria, into Jordan to aid the PLO, but in fact it was regular troops of the Syrian army. After the initial military successes of the invasion, King Hussein asked Israel to carry out airstrikes against Syrian troops together with the Jordanian Air Force. The airstrikes caused heavy losses for the Syrian troops, which was due to the almost full lack of air defense systems and the fact that the commander of the Syrian Air Force, Assad, did not agree to send squadrons to Jordan to support their invaded army. The decision to invade Jordan was not generally welcomed by Assad&#x27;s more moderate Ba&#x27;ath faction, and the troops withdrew. 

The action helped trigger a simmering conflict between the Jadid and Assad factions within the Ba&#x27;ath Party and army. The Syrian Communist Party aligned itself with Jadid, drawing him the support of Soviet ambassador, Nuritdin Mukhitdinov. Angered by this, Assad decided to scare the Soviets by sending Mustafa Tlass to Beijing to procure arms and wave Chairman Mao&#x27;s Little Red Book. In November 1970, Jadid tried to fire Assad and his supporter Mustafa Tlass. Assad responded by launching an intra-party coup dubbed the Corrective Movement. Jadid was arrested on 13 November 1970, and remained in the Mezzeh prison in Damascus until his death of a heart attack on 19 August 1993.

<text>Gottlieb von Jagow (22 June 1863 – 11 January 1935) was a German diplomat. He served as the State Secretary of the German Foreign Office between January 1913 and 1916.

==Early life==
Born in Berlin, Jagow was educated at the University of Bonn. He entered the diplomatic service in 1895 and was first assigned to the German embassy in Rome and then to the Prussian mission at Munich. After he had passed his examination in diplomacy in 1897, he was assigned to the Prussian mission at Hamburg but quickly switched again to Rome, where he advanced to the position of Second Secretary (legation counsellor). After a short interlude with the German mission at The Hague, he returned as First Secretary to the embassy in Rome in March 1901, where he stayed until 1906, when he was transferred to the Foreign Office in Berlin. He first made his mark as private secretary to Bernhard von Bülow, a former Imperial Chancellor. In December 1907, he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary to Luxembourg, in May 1909 he became German ambassador at Rome. During the Italo-Turkish War, he conducted important negotiations with the Italian government and, it is said, prevented a war between Austria-Hungary and Italy at the time.

In 1913, he was appointed Secretary of State (Foreign Minister) for Germany. He played an active part in the negotiations preceding the outbreak of World War I and was particularly concerned with German relations with Austria-Hungary. He was the first member of the German government in Berlin to become acquainted with the terms of the ultimatum of 18 October 1913 to Serbia, the first indication of the July 1914 crisis.

However, Sir Martin Gilbert wrote, &quot;War seemed unlikely in the spring and summer of 1914.&quot; The illusion of peace masked debates over aims of colonial annexation and supremacy in Africa, negotiated neutrality for other states to facilitate the invasion of France, and attempts to compete with British sea power. On 13 July 1914, Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph was persuaded to accept the ultimatum after Serbia had failed to accommodate the Austrian note.

Jagow married Countess Luitgard Ernestine zu Solms-Laubach (Arnsburg, 17 December 1873 - Arnsburg, 24 January 1954) in Arnsburg on 18 June 1914.

==A diplomacy towards war==
During the July Crisis on 6 July 1914, Jagow was confident that an Austro-Serbian war would be localized, and that Russia was not yet prepared for a continental war. This belief was incorrect: the Chancellor was more sceptical, which indirectly led to the outbreak of World War I. But by 29 July he was &quot;very depressed&quot; that Austria&#x27;s Note policy of duality had hastened war. After the war, Jagow attributed deeper reasons for the outbreak of war to &quot;this damned system of alliances.&quot; He had tried before war&#x27;s outbreak to persuade the Chancellor to allow a debate at the Reichstag on war aims in 1916, but a veto was imposed, and a ban on all criticism of the government. Long conferences with the Chancellor and Kaiser did nothing to change his mood. He wrongly believed Britain would respect Germany&#x27;s access to Rotterdam, part of the catalogue of grievances that caused the war. Consequently, he was perceived as the &quot;weak&quot; link in a weak government before being replaced. But he had always been aware of the French alliance with Britain. Furthermore, he made no secret of the racial Slavic nationalism threatened from Russia; as soon as her railways were complete she would invade. Jagow also indulged in taunting ally Austria as &quot;nervous&quot; while at the same time ignoring Serbia&#x27;s pleadings for peace. He attempted to lull Britain into a false sense of security, while &quot;cutting the lines&quot; of diplomatic communication after it was too late. In fact the fortnight&#x27;s delayed response to Austria&#x27;s commencement of hostilities gave Jagow the opportunity to blame Russia for starting the war. On 24 July the British thought he was &quot;quite ready to fall in with suggestion as to the four Powers working in favour of moderation at Vienna and St Petersburg&quot; But he was already ill and exhausted from his exertions, acknowledging that Serbia was the victim of bullying. He was a member of the Foreign ministry team that denied a British offer for a Five Power Conference, having already agreed to Moltke&#x27;s plan two days &quot;before&quot; Austria&#x27;s declaration against Serbia on 28 July 1914. The following day Lichnowsky&#x27;s cable telegram was ignored for hours, which Jagow argued was responsible for Bethmann-Hollweg&#x27;s &quot;misstep.&quot;

The Offensive Plan was revised by Jagow and his Chancellor and delivered to the King of the Belgians the next day as an ultimatum in a sealed envelope with a note demanding &quot;an unequivocal answer&quot; to Germany&#x27;s demand for her troops to be allowed to march through the country on the way to France.

The diminutive bureaucrat was eternally optimistic by character that German superiority would triumph. When the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Entente in November 1914, Jagow directed Leo Frobenius to try to persuade the government of Abyssinia to also join the Central Powers. The Tripolitana as it was known managed by the Mannesmann brothers was determined by economic &quot;realpolitik&quot; &quot;to collaborate with Turkey in raising the Sudan in revolt.&quot; Stirring revolt dominated German foreign policy in the East; at the heart of which was Jagow&#x27;s dialogue for the &quot;liberation of Poland&quot;. Instrumental was Under Secretary Zimmerman, one of Bethmann&#x27;s governmental supporters, who ran Agent Parvus in Constantinople: the aim was &quot;the complete destruction of Tsarism and the dismemberment of Russia into smaller states&quot;. Nonetheless Jagow was naturally cautious and particularly skeptical of the Turks&#x27; commitment to the alliance. At the same time however, he successfully secured Turkish sovereign rights over the Dardanelles on 18 April 1915. Yet determined to continue the fight in Galicia, when Jagow received President Wilson&#x27;s offer of an international peace congress negotiations, American mediation was flatly refused. He called it a &quot;schwarmerei&quot;; but as the war dragged on he became domineered by Zimmerman&#x27;s pretensions for the Chancellery. Successes in Russia encouraged him to keep Austria-Hungary in the war by &quot;finesse&quot; of any possible &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the Tsarists.

Jagow subscribed to the school of thought that Russia had to be pushed back deep into her hinterland. The irredentist solution was one of the Polish Kingdom&#x27;s independent enfranchisement, preventing the sullied blood to dilute German racial superiority. He told Baron Burian that the state must be ruled by Dualism and &quot;very extensive autonomy&quot; Austrian suzerainty. However, as in Belgium he sought &quot;Pan-Germanisation&quot;, and a customs area from Austria-Hungary, safeguarding German exports. More sinister was a program for ethnic cleansing of Poles and Jews conditional on an Austro-German military alliance. Jagow himself favoured the latter policy of annexation and germanisation. He sent a Memorandum on 11 September to Falkenhayn, who rejected any possibility of an alliance with Austria&#x27;s &quot;slipshod&quot; army. By 30 October Jagow had developed the idea that Courland and Lithuania should be annexed in return for Austrian-Poland &quot;chaining&quot; the Dual Monarchy&#x27;s destiny to Germany&#x27;s. An able and skilful diplomat, he persuaded the General Staff to drop objections to the political proposal to impose &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; on Vienna. The threat in Jagow&#x27;s mind was Slavic nationalism.

Wilson&#x27;s aide, Colonel House, reassured Jagow that US policy in 1916 was not designed to blame the civilian politicians but only the military: according to Friedrich Katz, Jagow was the principal supporter of a failed plan designed to involve the United States and Mexico in a war. At the time the Mexican Revolution had created rising tensions between both countries. As a result, Jagow expected that the United States would not enter World War I if it was militarily involved with Mexico. Nonetheless Jagow was responsible for the Longwiy-Breiy Plan to occupy the plateau that overlooked the city of Verdun made possible by Baron Romberg&#x27;s visit to Berlin. But it was merely a pretext for a new extension of German strategy deeper into France proper.

Jagow remained steadfastly anti-Russian, to the extent he sacked staff to get a putative alliance with Ushida, the Japanese ambassador. His meddling with Ushida in St Petersburg got him &#x27;discarded&#x27; too for attempting a separate peace with Russia on Germany&#x27;s behalf; he even confessedly admitted on 17 May 1916 that the &quot;whole swindle ceases to matter&quot;. Any diplomatic &quot;rapprochement&quot; was broken as it was unplanned, when Russia launched the Brusilov Offensive that summer. Jagow&#x27;s policy had woefully failed: he was scheming to introduce a Grand Duchy of Poland as Germany conspired to divide the country in half adopted Falkenhayn&#x27;s policy idea of a Germano-Polish Kingdom was declared on 5 November 1916; and a &quot;Flamenpolitik&quot; for the Poles, the &quot;Klub des polnischen Staatswesens&quot;. He recognised that Austria&#x27;s defeat had collapsed the front to Germany&#x27;s detriment. but Germany ignored Jagow&#x27;s former policy of a &#x27;preventive war&#x27; now discredited; for he had to do something that &quot;assures our future&quot;. The new Ludendorff alternative would make Poland &quot;also completely dependent on her economically&quot;.

Jagow retired in November 1916. A quiet, unassuming and scholarly man, he was one of the worst speakers in the Reichstag. James W. Gerard, United States ambassador to Germany at the time, in his book &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;, said Jagow was forced out of office by an agitation against him on account of his lack of force in defending government policy in the Reichstag.

Jagow wrote a defence of German policy entitled &quot;Ursachen und Ausbruch des Weltkrieges&quot; (“Causes and the outbreak of the World War”), published in 1919.

<text>Miangul Jahan Zeb HPk, HQA, CIE () (5 June 1908 – 14 September 1987), also known as Miangul Abdul-Haq Jahan Zeb, was the Wāli of Swat from 1949 to 1969, a princely state that is now part of Pakistan. He succeeded his father, Wadud of Swat. He is remembered for building schools, hospitals, and roads, but also for his absolute rule over the region, which ended in 1969. When Pakistan came into being, Wadud of Swat declared the accession of Swat State to Pakistan on 23 November 1947. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor-General of Pakistan, accepted the Instrument of Accession on 24 November 1947. Wadud of Swat announced his resignation in favor of his son Jehanzeb. Jahanzeb also worked to protect the landmarks of previous cultures.

==Early life and education==
Jahan Zeb, born in Saidu Sharif on 5 June 1908 to a Gujjar family, was the eldest son of Miangul Abdul Wadud also known as Wadud of Swat. He was educated at the Islamia Collegiate School in Peshawar and at Islamia College, part of the University of Peshawar. He had four sons and one daughter. Miangul Aurang Zeb, Wāli Ahad of Swat, a former governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and governor of Balochistan; Miangul Shahzada Alam Zeb, father of Miangul Akbar Zeb, the Pakistani high commissioner to Canada; Miangul Shahzada Amir Zeb, a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan in 1977, who also ruled Swat in the absence of his father; and Miangul Shahzada Ahmed Zeb.

==Political career==
Jahan Zeb was appointed Wāli Ahad in 1933. His father, the Wāli of Swat, eventually abdicated in favour of him, the eldest son, whom he had carefully educated along modern lines and gradually trained to assume the full burdens of government. Jahan Zeb was enthroned as Wāli of Swat on 12 December 1949. In 1951, he was granted the title of Ghazi-e-Millat and a hereditary salute.

==System of administration==
The role of the Wāli was that of a king and religious leader, chief minister and commander-in-chief, chief exchequer, and head qazi. He ensured that his government provided good administration and productive revenue collection; a judicial system that dispensed quick and free justice; a system of qala (forts) that lent security and protection to the people; and jobs, welfare, education, and health services. Rapid communication through roads, bridges, and telegraph and penal codes provided rule of law, and telephones and informers kept the Wāli apprised of developments. This was a unique system of administration.

==Patronage of education==
Jahan Zeb surpassed other contemporary rulers in the field of education. Before his era, Swat did not have a modern education system. His father laid the foundations of the system, which Jahan Zeb rapidly developed. He founded a girls&#x27; high school in Saidu Sharif, the first female educational institution in Swat. Jahanzeb College for Men has the importance of Aligarh College in the entire Malakand division. He also established a missionary school for girls at Sangota.

== Patronage of archaeology ==
The Wali was keen to preserve the history of his principality and investigate its archaeology. In 1955 he invited the Italian Archaeological Mission in Swat to the valley under the leadership of the noted scholar Giuseppe Tucci. In 1958 he sponsored the building of the Swat Museum, which contains exceptionally fine examples of Gandharan art and artifacts.

*Hon. LL.D. (University of Peshawar) (1965)

<text>(11August 177815October 1852) was a German gymnastics educator and nationalist whose writing is credited with the founding of the German gymnastics (Turner) movement, first realized at Volkspark Hasenheide in Berlin, the origin of modern sports clubs, as well as influencing the German Campaign of 1813, during which a coalition of German states effectively ended the occupation by Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire. His admirers know him as , roughly meaning &quot;Father of Gymnastics &quot;. Jahn invented the parallel bars, rings, high bar, the pommel horse and the vault horse.

== Life ==
 was born in the village of in Brandenburg, Prussia. He studied theology and philology from 1796 to 1802 at the universities in , , and . After the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, he joined the Prussian army. In 1809, he went to Berlin where he became a teacher at the and at the Plamann School.

Brooding upon what he saw as the humiliation of his native land by Napoleon, conceived the idea of restoring the spirits of his countrymen by the development of their physical and moral powers through the practice of gymnastics. The first , or open-air gymnasium, was opened by in in the south of Berlin in 1811, and the (gymnastics association) movement spread rapidly. Young gymnasts were taught to regard themselves as members of a kind of guild for the emancipation of their fatherland. The nationalistic spirit was nourished to a significant degree by the writings of .

In early 1813 took an active part in the formation of the famous Lützow Free Corps, a volunteer force in the Prussian army fighting Napoleon. He commanded a battalion of the corps, but he was often employed in the secret service during the same period. After the war, he returned to Berlin, where he was appointed state teacher of gymnastics, and he took on a role in the formation of the student patriotic fraternities, or , in .

A man of a populistic nature, rugged, eccentric and outspoken, often came into conflict with the authorities. The authorities eventually realized he aimed at establishing a united Germany and that his schools were political and liberal clubs. The conflict resulted in the closing of the in 1819 and arrest.

He advocated that the German states should unite after the withdrawal of Napoleon&#x27;s occupying armies and establish a democratic constitution under the monarchy, which would include the right to free speech. As a German nationalist, advocated maintaining German language and culture against foreign influence. In 1810 he wrote, &quot;Poles, French, priests, aristocrats and Jews are Germany&#x27;s misfortune.&quot; At the time wrote this, the German states were occupied by foreign armies under the leadership of Napoleon. Also, was &quot;the guiding spirit&quot; of the fanatic book burning episode carried out by revolutionary students at the Wartburg festival in 1817.

<doc id="772624" wikidata="Q5349248" url="?curid=772624" title="Eiken (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Seiji Matsuyama. It was serialized in Akita Shoten&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Champion&quot; from April 2001 to August 2004, with its chapters collected in 18 volumes. The story depicts the life of schoolboy Densuke Mifune after he is forced into the mysterious Eiken Club. It was adapted into a two-episode original video animation (OVA) produced by J.C.Staff. Both the manga and the OVA were licensed for English release in North America by Media Blasters.

==Plot==
Densuke has just enrolled at the exclusive Zashono Academy. He is very eager to participate in extracurricular activities, but never expected to join the mysterious Eiken Club. Strangely enough, every other member is a busty co-ed, and many of the club&#x27;s activities involve bikinis. But Densuke is not interested in anyone except for the shy and beautiful Chiharu Shinonome.

==Characters==
:
:The red-headed Chiharu is considered one of the most attractive girls at Zashono Academy. She is shy around boys, because she came from an all-girls school.
:
:A plain boy no one seems to notice, Densuke was forced into the Eiken Club after an accidental run-in with Chiharu, whom he develops a crush on. He eventually accepts his place in the club, despite being tormented by Kirika and the other mishaps that befall him, i.e. being beaten, violently crushed (Kirika, Yuriko) or electrocuted (Kyoko) by other members. Densuke is frequently forced to cross-dress by Kirika, a hobby of hers.
:
:Not much is known about Kirika, the purple-haired amazon that runs the Eiken Club. She likes putting Densuke in awkward situations for her amusement.
:
:The pink-haired Komoe is the youngest member of the Eiken Club at 11 years old, who dialogues with macromastia. Komoe is very clumsy, but always striving to do her best. Her clumsy mistakes often leave her exposed, and she has a habit of accidentally hurting and squashing Densuke when falling on him.
:
:Grace is a blonde-haired British girl who was born and grew up in China. She comes from a fortune-tellers&#x27; family and her father is a successful world-class enterpriser, also she is also very good at acrobatics. She seems to have a bit of feeling for Densuke as in the original manga, her words with Densuke in the speech bubbles are often ended with love-hearts. In the English version, her name was romanized as Lynn Grace.
:
:Kyoko is the small blue-haired girl who runs the science division of the Eiken Club, and would seem to be the second-in-command of the club. Despite her age, she looks a lot younger than she really is. She often hurts Densuke with her various inventions (rockets, electrocuters). In the English version, her name was romanized as Kyouko Morooka.
:
:Chiharu&#x27;s energetic sister, she looks like a short-haired cheekier version of Chiharu. Despite being fully aware of Densuke and Chiharu&#x27;s feelings for each other, Yuriko likes trying to get between them.
:
:Sensei is never named, though she is a teacher from Zashono Academy, she often laments the fact she always seems to go unnoticed by her students and peers, not to mention the fact that they never seem to remember her name. She has bright green hair. In the English version, she was simply called the Teacher.
:Teddy is a very shy young girl, who wears a giant bear suit most of the time. She has an older sister, who also wears a similar suit.
:
:Chiharu&#x27;s cousin, who also has a crush on Densuke. Her timetable always seems to be occupied by many part-time jobs. Densuke eventually finds out that she is secretly funding detectives who promised to find her long-lost father who left almost without a word after the divorce (due to the bankruptcy of his factory).
:She is head of Zashono Academy&#x27;s Committee of Student Accountants. She had mysteriously returned to the academy over a two year span with an immediate action of carrying out her own budget plan:to forcefully cancel all the activities of all the clubs in the academy, despite all the dirty tricks she has in mind.
:The ex-head of the Supernatural Club in Zashono Academy, a slim and weedy girl whose body is dotted with bandages from the countless bruises and wounds caused by falling due to fainting resulted by her anemia.
:The mother of the Shinonome family.
:The younger brother of Chiharu. He first appears pretending to be Chiharu in order to test Densuke. He is practically Chiharu&#x27;s twin, and it is hinted that he is interested in Densuke, whether that is true or not, is not known.
:
:He is the champion of the previous academy tournament who has returned from America to win the heart of Chiharu Shinonome. He is aware of Densuke&#x27;s feelings for her, and feels that competition is the only way to resolve the romantic triangle.

<doc id="772629" wikidata="Q53815" url="?curid=772629" title="Canon (fiction)">
<text>The canon of a work of fiction is &quot;the body of works taking place in a particular fictional world that are widely considered to be official or authoritative; [especially] those created by the original author or developer of the world&quot;. Canon is contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of fan fiction and other derivative works.

== Canonicity ==
When there are multiple &quot;official&quot; works or original media, what material is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;); by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media; by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities&#x27; universe, but not across them; or not resolved at all. 

There is also no consensus regarding who has the authority to decide what is or isn&#x27;t canonical, with copyright holders usually declaring themselves the authorities when they want to erase or retcon materials that were approved by the setting&#x27;s original creator (with &quot;Star Wars&quot; again being an example). The definition of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the &quot;Star Trek&quot; remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.

=== Examples ===
The official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website describes the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon as &quot;the events that take place within the episodes and movies&quot;, referring to the live-action television series and films, with &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; having long existed in a nebulous gray area of canonicity. Events, characters, and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that &quot;canon is not something set in stone&quot;.

During George Lucas&#x27;s time with the franchise, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon was divided into discrete tiers that incorporated the Expanded Universe (EU), with continuity tracked by Lucasfilm creative executive Leland Chee. Higher-tier and newer material abrogated lower-tier and older material in case of contradiction. The live-action theatrical films, the 2008 &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; TV series and its debut film, and statements by Lucas himself were at the top of this hierarchy; such works invariably superseded EU material in case of contradiction. The EU itself was further divided into several descending levels of continuity. After Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise, Lucasfilm designated all Expanded Universe material published before 25 April 2014 (other than the first six theatrical films and the 2008 &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; film and TV series) as the non-canonical &quot;Legends&quot; continuity. Material released since this announcement is a separate canonical timeline from the original George Lucas Canon, with all narrative development overseen by the Lucasfilm Story Group.

The makers of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with Russell T Davies explaining that he does not think about the concept for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series or its spin-offs.

The television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has as an example of non-canonical material the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes, a series of Halloween-themed specials with several stories that take place outside the show&#x27;s normal continuity.

Several anime television series adapted from manga stories count with some extra episodes with original stories that are not part of the original manga, often being referred to as &quot;filler episodes,&quot; being outside of the canon of their source material.

==Additional works==

===Other writers===
The canonical status of some works by the original writer but not the same publisher, such as &quot;The Field Bazaar&quot;, may be debated. 
This is because copyright used to be exercised by the publisher of the work of literature rather than the author. 
Campaigning by Victor Hugo led to the Berne Convention which introduced author&#x27;s rights.

However, sometimes in literature, original writers have not approved works as canon, but original publishers or literary estates of original writers posthumously approve subsequent works as canon, such as &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot; (1921) (by original publisher), &quot;Porto Bello Gold&quot; (1924) (by estate), and &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot; (1938) (by estate).

====Late 20th century====
In film and television it is common that the original writer does not decide what is canon. In literature, the estate of H. G. Wells authorised sequels by Stephen Baxter, &quot;The Massacre of Mankind&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Time Ships&quot; (1995). &quot;Scarlett&quot; was a 1991 sequel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; authorised by the estate.

====21st century====
In 2010, the Conan Doyle estate authorised &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;The House of Silk&quot;.
Sequels to the stories by P G Wodehouse about the butler Jeeves were sanctioned by Wodehouse&#x27;s estate for &quot;Jeeves and the Wedding Bells&quot; (2013) by Sebastian Faulks and &quot;Jeeves and the King of Clubs&quot; (2018) by Ben Schott. &quot;The Monogram Murders&quot; (2014) by Sophie Hannah is a sequel to Hercule Poirot novels authorised by the Agatha Christie estate.

==Fanon==

Fan fiction is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as &quot;fanon&quot;, a blend of &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;canon&quot;. Similarly, the term &quot;headcanon&quot; is used to describe a fan&#x27;s personal interpretation of a fictional universe.

<text>A candlestick is a device used to hold a candle in place. Candlesticks have a cup or a spike (&quot;pricket&quot;) or both to keep the candle in place. Candlesticks are sometimes called &quot;candleholders&quot;.

Before the proliferation of electricity, candles were carried between rooms using a chamberstick, a short candlestick with a pan to catch dripping wax.

Although electric lighting has phased out candles in much of the world, candlesticks and candelabras are still used in homes as decorative elements or to add atmosphere on special occasions.

== Religious use ==
Candles and candlesticks are also used frequently in religious rituals and for spiritual means as both functional and symbolic lights.

In Jewish homes, two candles are lit to mark the beginning of the Sabbath at sundown every Friday, hence, candlesticks are often on display. A seven-branched candelabra, known as the menorah, is the national symbol of the State of Israel, based on the candelabra that was used in the Temple in Jerusalem in ancient times. Another special candelabra found in many Jewish homes is the Hanukiah, the Hanukkah menorah that holds eight candles plus an extra one for lighting the others.

Tall candlesticks and altar lamps are often found in Christian churches as well.

A special set of two- and three-branched candelabras called the dikirion and trikirion is used by Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox bishops to bless people at worship services.

A triple candlestick was used before 1955 in the Catholic Church.

<text>Under a Killing Moon is a 1994 point-and-click adventure interactive movie video game. It is the third installment in the &quot;Tex Murphy&quot; series of adventure games produced by Access Software. In it, the detective Tex Murphy finds himself unwittingly involved in the affairs of a dangerous cult.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; dramatically shifted the gameplay of its predecessors in the series by fully utilizing interactive 3D environments. The player controls the protagonist Tex from a first-person perspective. The virtual world allows full freedom of movement, and as such allows the player to look for clues in every nook and cranny. It was also the first &quot;Tex Murphy&quot; game to stray from the traditional adventure game dialogue format of providing options that showed exactly what the player&#x27;s character would say. Instead, descriptions of the dialogue choices were given, providing some mystery to what Tex would say.

==Plot==
&quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; takes place in post-World War III San Francisco in December 2042. After the devastating events of the nuclear war, many major cities have been rebuilt (as is the case with New San Francisco), though certain areas still remain as they were before the war (as in Old San Francisco). The war also left another mark on the world: the formation of two classes of citizens. Specifically, some people have developed a natural resistance against radioactivity, and thus are normal or &quot;Norms&quot; – everybody else is a Mutant in some form. Tensions between the two groups have risen dramatically and Norms and Mutants usually do not get along. The Mutants are usually forced to live in the run-down areas of cities such as Old San Francisco. Tex Murphy lives on Chandler Avenue in Old San Francisco. All his friends are Mutants, though he is a Norm.

In &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot;, Tex Murphy, a private investigator, has hit rock bottom. Recently divorced from his wife Sylvia, out of work, low on cash, and living in a run-down part of Old San Francisco, Tex realizes that he has to get his act together. Tex sets out to hunt for work. He finds it quickly once he discovers that the pawnshop across the street from his apartment has been burglarized. Tex quickly solves the case, and feels his luck has begun to change. Then a mysterious woman calling herself Countess Renier, having heard good things about Tex, hires him to find her missing statuette. Everything seems great at first and the Countess is promising to pay Tex more money than he has seen in his life. However, everything quickly goes downhill when Tex finds out about a doomsday plot by a deadly cult calling themselves the Brotherhood of Purity.

==Development and release==
&quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; was one of the largest video games of its era, with a budget between $2 million and $3 million, and arriving on four CD-ROMs (although some material was duplicated among the four to reduce the amount of swapping). The game combined full motion video (FMV) cutscenes with an advanced 3D virtual world to explore. Though action games with 3D environments and a first-person perspective had been popularized by first-person shooters such as &quot;Doom&quot;, it was very unusual at the time to see these characteristics used in an adventure game. It is notable that the game&#x27;s 3D graphics did not use ray casting techniques like &quot;Doom&quot;, but true texture-mapped polygons that allowed players to look in all directions as well as duck, and ran in then-high resolutions of up to 640x480. The designers Chris Jones and Aaron Conners recalled they went to their programmers and said that they wanted the 3D movement of &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, but also wanted to look closer to the quality of pre-rendered graphics of &quot;The 7th Guest&quot;.

The game was originally released on October 31, 1994. After its creators reacquired the rights to the series, it was re-released on Good Old Games in June 2009.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Following &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot;″s launch in late 1994, market research firm PC Data named it the United States&#x27; fifth-best-selling computer game of November. The game&#x27;s overall sales had reached 400,000 copies before the release of &quot;Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive&quot; in 1996. At the time, Access reported that it had &quot;broken all Access Software sales records&quot;.

===Critical reviews===
&quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; received universally positive reviews. Contemporary reviews praised the game for its technology and cinematic presentation. In 2002, Adventure Gamers gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5, praising a mystery plot, characters and a classic Tex Murphy humor. According to IGN in 2006, the game has weathered the test of time and called it as one of the best detective games of all time. IGN also called it &quot;a landmark for adventure games&quot; and &quot;a rebirth for the series&quot;, using new technology to create a game that was both cinematic and playable.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked it as the 99th in the magazine&#x27;s 1996 list of the best computer games of all time for the &quot;campy humor combined with amazing 3D scenery in this futuristic film noir&quot;. In 2011, Adventure Gamers placed it 25th on their list of all-time best adventure games.

&quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; won the&#x27; Codie awards 1994 &quot;Best Fantasy Role Playing/Adventure Program&quot; prize.

==Novelization==
A novelization of &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot; was written by the game&#x27;s original writer Aaron Conners in 1996. Although the basic plot, characters, and setting remain mostly the same, it differs significantly from the game, providing a great deal of extra information, new characters, character deaths, and more detailed character motivations related to the main plot involving the Moonchild, while removing scenes and characters from the game that did not relate to the Moonchild plot, creating a more singular Chandler-esque mystery novel. The final ending of the game (meeting The Colonel and Eva in the bar, and dancing lessons with Delores Lightbody) is also changed to continue this style.

<text>The Emory University School of Medicine is the graduate medical school of Emory University and a component of Emory’s Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center. Emory University School of Medicine traces its origins back to 1915 when the Atlanta Medical College (founded 1854), the Southern Medical College (1878), and the Atlanta School of Medicine (founded 1905) merged.

Emory University School of Medicine is located on the university&#x27;s main campus in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. The medical school offers a full-time Doctor of Medicine degree program, Masters programs in Anesthesiology and Genetic Counseling, degrees in Physical Therapy and Physician Assistant training, joint degree programs with other Emory graduate divisions, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education.

== History ==
Before it was established as the Emory School of Medicine in 1915, the school first began as the Atlanta Medical College. Founded in 1854 by a group of physicians led by Dr. John G. Westmoreland, the college began during unfavorable financial conditions along with competition of three other medical schools opening in the state, driving up competition for students. Despite these challenges, the Atlanta Medical College continued operation until August 1861 when classes were suspended due to the Civil War. Several years later, the College merged with the Southern Medical College, leading to the creation of the Atlanta College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1898. 

The College existed for 14 years before another merger took place, this time due to encouragement from the Council of Medical Education. The Council promised that if the Atlanta College of Physicians and Surgeons merged with the Atlanta School of Medicine, they would receive a Class A rating. After the merger, the American Medical Association began pressuring medical schools to align with universities in order to improve the quality of medical education nationwide. Just two years after the formation of the second version of the Atlanta Medical College, the College combined with Emory University, which was in its initial stages of development and sought to add medical education to its offerings. On June 28, 1915 the Emory School of Medicine was established.

Emory University School of Medicine traces its origins back to 1915 when the Atlanta Medical College (founded 1854), the Southern Medical College (1878), and the Atlanta School of Medicine (founded 1905) merged.

== Admission and societies ==
In 2017, the entering class of 143 medical students hailed from 65 different colleges and had an average undergraduate GPA of 3.7 and an average MCAT of 514. In the 2017 entering class, 57% of the students were female, 8% were MD/PhD, 15% were MD/MPH, the average age at matriculation was 23.6 with a range of 21 to 31. Three students (2%) were non-U.S. citizens/permanent residents from Germany, Jamaica, and Turkey. 69% of the class were non-traditional students, meaning that they took at least 1 year out from college prior to matriculation.

Upon matriculation, medical students are divided into four societies through which they participate in small group learning exercises that foster differential diagnosis abilities, clinical skills, and professional development. The societies are named after four historic physicians who contributed significantly to the practice of medical science during their lifetimes.

* William Harvey Society
* Ignaz Semmelweis Society 
* Joseph Lister Society 
* Sir William Osler Society

== Curriculum ==
The curriculum features a condensed pre-clinical learning phase in which students cover the basic medical sciences in 1.5 years. Students typically take the USMLE Step 1 by February of their second year allowing them to begin their medical clerkship phase at Emory-affiliated hospitals. The unique design of the curriculum allows for a 5-month Discovery Phase in the third year which encourages students to pursue research in any medically related field including basic science, translational medicine, clinical research, public health, among others. The Emory University School of Medicine offers a variety of dual degree programs including MD-Masters in Public Health, MD-Masters in Clinical Research, MD-Masters in Business Administration, MD-MA in Bioethics, and MD-PhD (the PhD can be completed through the Emory University Laney Graduate School, Rollins School of Public Health, or the Georgia Institute of Technology).

== Training facilities and affiliated institutions ==
The School of Medicine is located on the main Emory University campus in the Druid Hills section of Atlanta 
and in Emory-owned and affiliated medical facilities throughout metropolitan Atlanta including Grady Memorial Hospital, Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta. Many of these hospitals are part of Emory Healthcare. Affiliated research institutions include Yerkes National Primate Research Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

== Rankings and reputation ==
In its 2021 rankings of the best medical schools in the United States, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; placed Emory University School of Medicine at #24 in research and #25 in primary care. &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; placed the School of Medicine at #32 in the world for Clinical/Pre-clinical and Health in its 2019 rankings list.

<text>A megacryometeor is a very large chunk of ice which, despite sharing many textural, hydro-chemical, and isotopic features found in large hailstones, is formed under unusual atmospheric conditions which clearly differ from those of the cumulonimbus cloud scenario (i.e. clear-sky conditions). They are sometimes called huge hailstones, but do not need to form under thunderstorm conditions unlike hailstorms. Jesús Martínez-Frías, a planetary geologist and astrobiologist at Institute of Geosciences (, IGEO) in the Spanish National Research Council (, CSIC) in Madrid, pioneered research into megacryometeors.

==Mass and size==
More than 50 megacryometeors have been recorded since the year 2000. They vary in mass between to several tens of kilograms. One in Brazil weighed in at more than .
Chunks about in size also fell in Scotland on 13 August 1849.

==Formation==
The process that creates megacryometeors is not completely understood yet, mainly with respect to the atmospheric dynamics necessary to produce them. They may have a similar mechanism of formation that leads to the production of hailstones. Scientific studies show that their composition matches normal tropospheric rainwater for the areas in which they fall. In addition, megacryometeors also display textural variations of the ice surface and hydro-chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in its composition, which gives potential evidence to a complex formation process in the lower atmosphere. It is known that they do not form from airplane toilet leakage because the large chunks of ice that occasionally do fall from airliners are distinctly blue due to the disinfectant used by them (hence their common name of &quot;blue ice&quot;).

Some have speculated that these ice chunks must have fallen from aircraft fuselages after plain water ice accumulating on those aircraft through normal atmospheric conditions has simply broken loose. However, similar events also occurred prior to the invention of aircraft. Studies indicate that the metrological fluctuations in tropopause, associated with hydration of the lower stratosphere and stratospheric cooling, can be related to their formation. A detailed micro-Raman spectroscopic study made it possible to place the formation of the megacryometeors within a particular range of temperatures: . They are sometimes confused with meteors because they can leave small impact craters, though they form in the atmosphere and not from outer space.

<text>The Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) is the public health school of Emory University. Founded in 1990, Rollins has more than 1,100 students pursuing master&#x27;s degrees (MPH/MSPH) and over 150 students pursuing doctorate degrees (PhD). The school comprises six departments: Behavioral, Social, and Health Education Sciences (BSHES), Biostatistics (BIOS), Environmental Health (EH), Epidemiology (EPI), Global Health (GH), and Health Policy and Management (HPM), as well as an Executive MPH program (EMPH).

In addition to pursuing degrees from a single department, students may also participate in joint programs, both within Rollins and in conjunction with other professional schools at Emory (including Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University School of Law, and Goizueta Business School). Unique programs to Rollins are Global Environmental Health, Global Epidemiology, and the joint EH/EPI MSPH program.

One of the founding fathers of Rollins was Dr. David Sencer, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1966 to 1977 and New York City Health Commissioner from 1981 to 1985. In his honor, the David Sencer Scholarship Fund was established at Rollins in 2008. Rollins continues to be closely affiliated with CDC, along with multiple other public health institutions, such as the Emory Global Health Institute.

==Reputation==
In the most recent rankings (2024), Rollins was ranked number 3 among accredited schools and programs of public health by U.S. News &amp; World Report, and is one of two schools of public health founded in the past 50 years to be ranked in the top 12.

==Location==
Atlanta is commonly referred to as the world&#x27;s public health capital, and with good reason— the primary office of the CDC is located next door to Rollins, and there are a large number of other public health groups (consulting, NGO, and informatics-related) located across the city, such as Deloitte and CARE (relief agency).

== Notable programs ==

=== GEMMA ===
Global Elimination of Maternal Mortality from Abortion (GEMMA) is a scholarship program where eligible graduate-level students are provided opportunities in developing countries for field research and other practicums related to reproductive health, students can also utilize this scholarship to aid their research and help publish their findings associated with maternal mortality from abortion.

The GEMMA program was established by RSPH professor Dr. Roger Rochat and his wife Susan Rochat. This program aims to eradicate maternal deaths associated with abortion

==== History ====
Dr. Rochat a physician and an epidemiologist, has worked in more than 40 countries during his 30 years with CDC, this exposure provided him the opportunity to research around 70,000 instances of unsafe abortion and abortion-related deaths. This motivated Rochat and his wife to set up the GEMMA fund with the intention that this would inspire and support students to research in this field. They believe that through the dissemination of proper awareness for appropriate use of contraception, sex education, and with the provision for legal and safe induced abortion they could condense nearly all deaths associated with abortion.

==== GEMMA Seminar ====
GEMMA seminar is a public-health course that solely focuses on abortion and concentrates on tackling the concerns of abortion involving medical, ethical, legal, human rights, and religious views. This course is taught by Dr.Rochat and Dr.Lathrop with other guest lecturers and is available for enrollment in each spring.

==== Student Grants ====
Grants up to USD 700 are granted through the GEMMA awards program.

Graduate students of Emory University who possess practical research experience can apply for this scholarship through the GEMMA awards program for activities, events, research, or any programs that contribute to raising awareness and subsequently may help in the elimination of deaths associated with abortion.

Students can also avail of this scholarship to assist them in publishing their research findings or their thesis, related to this topic.

==== Events and Collaborations ====
GEMMA provides opportunities for collaboration with various organizations like the World Health Organization, International Planned Parenthood, Global Doctors for Choice.

Every year GEMMA members actively participate in organizing various events in association with Emory Reproductive Health Association (ERHA) to promote awareness about reproductive health and justice, both at home and abroad.

Some of the events are :

· Reproductive Justice 101

· Breaking Our Silence: an Abortion Storytelling Event

· Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health Networking Night

· ERHA and GEMMA General Body Meeting

· Sex in the Dark

· Film Screening: &#x27;Reversing Roe&#x27;

· Lunch &amp; Learn with Megan Gordon

· Doughnut Sale Fundraise

· ERHA Annual Chocolate Genitalia Sale

The school was endowed by Randall Rollins, who named it after his father, O. Wayne Rollins, a self-made business entrepreneur and innovator who participated in numerous ventures with his brother, John W. Rollins. Several members of the Rollins family have served on the Emory University Board of Trustees.

On July 9, 2007, the O. Wayne Rollins Foundation and Grace Crum Rollins donated $50 million to the School. The donation doubled the school&#x27;s physical structure, adding . It was one of the largest donations to a public health school in the history of higher education. The expansion was completed in May 2010 and the new building was dedicated on October 6, 2010.

<doc id="772644" wikidata="Q1282487" url="?curid=772644" title="Nacio Herb Brown">
<text>Ignacio Herbert &quot;Nacio Herb&quot; Brown (February 22, 1896 – September 28, 1964) was an American composer of popular songs, movie scores and Broadway theatre music in the 1920s through the early 1950s. Amongst his most enduring work is the score for the 1952 musical film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;.

==Life and career==
Ignacio Herbert Brown was born in Deming, New Mexico, United States, to Ignacio and Cora Brown. He had an older sister, Charlotte. In 1901, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he attended Manual Arts High School. His music education started with instruction from his mother, Cora Alice (Hopkins) Brown. Brown first operated a tailoring business (1916), and then became a financially successful realtor, but he always wrote and played music. After his first hit &quot;Coral Sea&quot; (1920) and a first big hit, &quot;When Buddha Smiles&quot; (1921), he eventually became a full-time composer. He joined The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1927, the same year writing the piano instrumental &quot;The Doll Dance&quot;. This was followed by two more popular Doll-based tunes, &quot;Rag Doll&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Wedding of the Painted Doll&quot;, released in 1929.

In 1928, he was hired to work in Hollywood by MGM and write film scores for the new medium of sound film. For his film work, he often collaborated with lyricist Arthur Freed. Their music is collected for the most part in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. He appeared in the MGM variety film &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;. Brown also worked with Richard A. Whiting and Buddy De Sylva on Broadway Musicals such as &quot;Take a Chance&quot;.

Along with L. Wolfe Gilbert, Brown wrote the music for the children&#x27;s television western, &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;, which first aired in 1949.

After an 18-month illness and a brief hospitalization at UCSF Medical Center, Brown died of cancer on September 28, 1964, in San Francisco, California, at the home of his children, Nacio Jan Brown and Candace Nacio Brown.

==Marriage==
Brown was married at least five times.
# Ruby Porter, with whom he had one child, Nacio Herb Brown, Jr., who also became a composer. Brown and Porter divorced in 1931.
# In 1932 he married Jeanne Borlini Lockhart.
# In 1934 he married actress Anita Page. 
# Beffie Kellogg
# In 1942 he married Georgeann Morris. They divorced in 1952. The couple had two children, Nacio Jan Brown, b.1943, and Candace Brown, b. 1945.

==Legacy==
He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, and into the New Mexico Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>Lin Newborn (May 7, 1974 – July 4, 1998) was an African-American anti-racist skinhead who was murdered by white supremacists in July 1998 alongside his friend, Daniel Shersty. 

== Life ==
Newborn spent much of his adult life campaigning against racism. He specialized in de-programming young, newly recruited Nazi Skinheads, convincing them that they could be a part of a greater family that didn&#x27;t discriminate against religion, ethnic background or sexual orientation. He taught that love and unity were stronger than hatred. A native of Pomona, California, he lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he was a member of the Las Vegas Unity Skins and sang in the band Counter Culture (a local Las Vegas punk band) and later in Life of Lies which ended around 1996. 

On July 4, 1998, white supremacists murdered Newborn at the age of 24 along with his friend, Daniel Shersty. On July 6, 1998, Newborn&#x27;s body was found three miles west of U.S. Highway 95 near Rome Boulevard, within of Shersty&#x27;s body. Police state that the victims were lured by two women, under the pretext of attending a party. Newborn and Shersty were taken to a northwest part of the valley, where they were beaten and possibly tortured before being shot to death. Police speculate that Newborn may have been trying to escape when he was killed.

John &quot;Polar Bear&quot; Butler (then 26), a known neo-Nazi, was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death. He was allegedly the leader of a group called the Independent Nazi Skins. After appealing, Butler&#x27;s death sentence was vacated and he was given four life terms without parole. He is registered with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department&#x27;s gang unit as a white supremacist. He is currently housed at High Desert State Prison in Nevada.

== Poem ==
In a poem dated December 5, 1993, Newborn may have been predicting his own death. Language from the poem mirrors that of a threatening note found in Butler&#x27;s stolen Jeep, which reads, in part &quot;&quot;&#x27;Do you know this punk ass SHARP named Spit [Newborn&#x27;s moniker]? You pulled a gun on his bitch.&#x27;&quot; The letter writer also wanted &quot;this punk Spit to know that he can be reached out and touched.&quot;

The poem (which may be titled &quot;Shell&quot; because of the picture of a shell at the top with the word written in it), reads:

&lt;poem&gt;Shell -- IDYLL KYLLJOI SPITX

COME AND TOUCH ME,
GREAT FATHER...
DEATH!
Tis for you I Walk the Edge!
Tis for you I Cross the Line!
Tis for you Ive [sic] DIED Again.
Set me FREE FROM my hell
I don&#x27;t want to FACE
you!
You are here...
but only for me now!
So now I&#x27;ve died!
Is this my hell?
Is this my hell?
Is this my hell?
The Fucking Angels ARE gone
I&#x27;m slane [sic] again
There&#x27;s nothing here 
Except
my shell, my shell, my shell
is sold to you Again
my shell is yours again,
touch me, but only to 
SET ME FREE!
I can&#x27;t be slane [sic] anymore!
I can&#x27;t be yours anymore!&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="772649" wikidata="Q712835" url="?curid=772649" title="Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>Taiwan pursued a number of weapons of mass destruction programs from 1949 to the late 1980s. The final secret nuclear weapons program was shut down in the late 1980s under US pressure after completing all stages of weapons development besides final assembly and testing. Taiwan lacked an effective delivery mechanism and would have needed to further miniaturize any weapon for effective use in combat. Currently, there is no evidence of Taiwan possessing any chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. However, nuclear weapons from the United States were deployed to Taiwan during a period of heightened regional tensions with China beginning with the First Taiwan Strait Crisis and ending in the 1970s.

== Nuclear weapons ==

During the Cold War, the United States deployed nuclear weapons on Taiwan as part of the United States Taiwan Defense Command. In 1972, United States president Richard Nixon ordered nuclear weapons to be removed from Taiwan and this was implemented by 1974. Nuclear weapons are known to have been stored at Tainan Air Force Base.

=== Research program ===

The development of nuclear weapons by Taiwan has been a contentious issue, as it had been triggered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China first nuclear test in 1964. The United States, hoping to avoid escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait, has continually opposed arming Taiwan with nuclear weapons after 1979. Accordingly, Taiwan adheres to the principles of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has stated that it does not intend to produce nuclear weapons, on an official basis. Past nuclear research by Taiwan makes it a &quot;threshold&quot; nuclear state.

In 1967, a secret nuclear weapons program began under the auspices of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology. Taiwan was able to acquire nuclear technology from abroad (including a research reactor from Canada and low-grade plutonium from the United States) allegedly for a civilian energy system, but in actuality to develop fuel for nuclear weapons. Taiwan bought 100 tons of uranium metal from South Africa which was delivered between 1973 and 1974.

During the 1970s, Taiwan had an active program to produce plutonium using heavy water reactors. However, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found evidence of Taiwan&#x27;s efforts to produce weapons-grade plutonium, Taiwan agreed in September 1976 under U.S. pressure to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. A study by the Mitre Corporation in 1977, included Taiwan in a list of &quot;insecure&quot; nuclear threshold states—states with the technical capability to develop nuclear weapons and the security motivations to seriously contemplate such an option. The other states were Israel, South Africa, South Korea, and Yugoslavia. U.S. intelligence also believed that Taiwan had designed devices suitable for nuclear testing. In 1980 the Taiwanese contracted for 4,000 tons of uranium metal from South Africa although it is not known how much of this order was ever delivered.

The leaders of the program needed very high assurance in the functioning and reliability of any nuclear device they designed, but without the ability to conduct a full-scale nuclear weapons test. Besides the need to keep the program covert, an underground nuclear test was not feasible on a small and densely populated island such as Taiwan. Therefore the program used specialised computer software to simulate nuclear weapon explosions, the code of which was constantly upgraded and improved as more knowledge was acquired via experiments or by clandestine information gathering. To circumvent detection by foreign intelligence agencies while developing and refining necessary skills, Taiwan developed many dual-use activities, such as &quot;anti-tank projectile&quot; experiments. These involved uranium metal plates being slammed together at a tremendous velocity under controlled conditions, and high-speed diagnostic equipment monitoring the impact while recording temperature and pressure data, which was then fed back into the computer simulation software to improve the accuracy of how a nuclear device would behave during and after detonation. 

These tests also allowed the testing of the reliability of the high explosives to be used in warheads and the detonating systems used to ensure the simultaneous triggering of many explosive panels on any implosion type designs. As well as enabling relevant data to be gathered and analyzed, these activities allowed Taiwanese technicians to practice daily the skills needed to produce actual warheads (such as the tooling of radioactive metals into individual components) if the order was ever given to begin full scale production of nuclear weapons.

The secret nuclear weapon program was revealed after the 1987 Lieyu massacre, when Colonel Chang Hsien-yi Deputy Director of Nuclear Research at INER, who was secretly working for the CIA, defected to the U.S. in December 1987 and produced a cache of incriminating documents. General Hau Pei-tsun claimed that scientists in Taiwan had already produced a controlled nuclear reaction. Under pressure from the U.S., the program was halted. A study into the secret program concluded that at the time of Chang&#x27;s defection, Taiwan was one or two years away from being able to complete a deliverable weapon. Chang claims that Madame Chiang Kai Shek and military officials loyal to her had expedited the development of nuclear weapons and even set up a parallel chain of command to further their agenda. In 1987 the warhead design had a diameter of 60–70 cm with casing and a weight of 900 kg meaning that further miniaturization would have been needed to optimize the weapon for delivery.

=== Delivery systems ===

The Sky Horse ballistic missile system was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s before a combination of pressure from American President Ronald Reagan and internal competition from anti-ballistic missile development programs ended the program in 1982. Faced with an inability to field their desired delivery system planners turned to alternatives.

The secondary delivery vehicle was the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, then in development. Weapons designers at CSIST (now NCSIST) were instructed to design the nuclear weapon to fit within the dimensions of the F-CK-1&#x27;s centerline drop tank (~50 cm diameter). Modifications to the aircraft would have been required for it to obtain the desired 1,000 km range (especially without the centerline drop tank available). The F-CK-1 would not have been able to fulfill the nuclear strike mission until mid-1989 at the very earliest. Early designs called for an unpowered gravity bomb.

=== Current status ===
Since the end of the nuclear weapons program the “Nuclear Card” has played an important part in Taiwan&#x27;s relationship with both the United States and China.

During the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, then President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, proposed to reactivate the program, but toned down the rhetoric a few days later, saying that although Taiwan was nuclear latent, it &quot;will definitely not&quot; produce nuclear weapons.

There is no evidence that Taiwan possesses any nuclear weapons or any programs to produce them, although it does have the advanced technological ability necessary to develop nuclear weapons as well as the high-tech ability to enrich uranium or process plutonium. Taiwan&#x27;s nuclear power plants use imported enriched uranium and are subject to IAEA inspections.

Taiwan theoretically has the potential to develop nuclear weapons from domestic monazite reserves, and this potential was explored by the military in 1951–1952. However, the monazite&#x27;s thorium content was deemed too low to justify recovering, and the military turned to friendly foreign sources instead.

In light of rising tensions in Cross-Strait relations, especially after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, some have called for Taiwan to arm itself with nuclear weapons, especially commentators in the United States. This is subject to wide debate, with some arguing that nuclear weapons could prove a deterrent strong enough to force the mainland to indefinitely postpone an invasion, given that Taiwan is not like Japan and South Korea in that the latter two have treaty-bound security guarantees from the United States, though opponents argue that nuclear weapons in themselves are costly, unpopular among the Taiwanese public, and that they themselves would instigate a conflict.

== Chemical and biological weapons ==
During the Japanese colonial period a chemical weapons factory was in operation in North Taiwan; the Nationalists took possession of this facility following the conclusion of World War II and are believed to have expanded the facility.

The U.S. Congress was informed in 1989 that Taiwan could have acquired offensive chemical weapons capability, including stockpiles of sarin. The alleged facilities include Tsishan and Kuanhsi. Taiwanese authorities acknowledged only the existence of a defensive research program.

In 1997 the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service assessed that Taiwan did not possess biological weapons but had &quot;shown signs of conducting biological research of an applied military nature.”

There have been rumors of ongoing offensive and defensive Taiwanese biological and chemical weapons programs but no conclusive evidence of development or deployment has ever been presented.

In July 2023, United Daily News (UDN) reported allegations of a meeting between U.S. and Taiwanese officials regarding the creation of a bioweapon lab, which was denied by U.S. and Taiwanese authorities. Radio Free Asia&#x27;s Asia Fact Check Lab (AFCL) found inconsistencies in the document&#x27;s language and format, suggesting it was written in mainland Chinese, not Taiwanese style. This apparent disinformation was amplified by pro-China commentators in Taiwan and received widespread coverage in Chinese media.

== Ratification of international treaties ==
The Republic of China ratified the Geneva Protocol on August 7, 1929, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1970, and Taiwan considers itself bound by both. Following UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 (1971), the United Nations recognizes the People&#x27;s Republic of China and does not treat Taiwan as a sovereign state with the legal ability to join international treaties. Because of its controversial political status, Taiwan has not been allowed to join either the Biological Weapons Convention or the Chemical Weapons Convention, but it has stated that it will abide by both treaties nevertheless. In addition, Taiwan has stated that it will continue to abide by the NPT, notwithstanding Resolution 2758. Taiwan was one of the original members of the NPT in 1968. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China replaced Taiwan at the United Nations in 1971, in effect Taiwan ceased to be active as a participating party to the official NPT activities. However, it signed a trilateral agreement with the United States and the IAEA in 1971 stating that it would continue to abide by the terms of the NPT as a ratification party. While not a member of the IAEA, Taiwan does continue to subscribe to the IAEA safeguards under two agreements, INFCIRC/133 and INFCIRC/158.

<text>Sir Charles Scott Sherrington (27 November 1857 – 4 March 1952) was a British neurophysiologist. His experimental research established many aspects of contemporary neuroscience, including the concept of the spinal reflex as a system involving connected neurons (the &quot;neuron doctrine&quot;), and the ways in which signal transmission between neurons can be potentiated or depotentiated. Sherrington himself coined the word &quot;synapse&quot; to define the connection between two neurons. His book &quot;The Integrative Action of the Nervous System&quot; (1906) is a synthesis of this work, in recognition of which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1932 (along with Edgar Adrian).

In addition to his work in physiology, Sherrington did research in histology, bacteriology, and pathology. He was president of the Royal Society in the early 1920s.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Official biographies claim Charles Scott Sherrington was born in Islington, London, England, on 27 November 1857, and that he was the son of James Norton Sherrington, a country doctor, and his wife, Anne Thurtell. However James Norton Sherrington was an ironmonger and artist&#x27;s colourman in Great Yarmouth, not a doctor, and died in Yarmouth in 1848, nearly 9 years before Charles was born.

In the 1861 census, Charles is recorded as Charles Scott (boarder, 4, born India) with Anne Sherrington (widow) as the head and Caleb Rose (visitor, married, surgeon). He was brought up in this household with Caleb recorded as head in 1871, although Anne and Caleb did not marry until after the death of his wife in 1880.

The relationship between Charles and his childhood family is unknown. During the 1860s the whole family moved to Anglesea Road, Ipswich, reputedly because London exacerbated Caleb Rose&#x27;s tendency to asthma.

Sherrington&#x27;s origins have been discussed in several published sources: Chris Moss and Susan Hunter, in the &quot;Journal of Medical Biography&quot; of January 2018, presented an article discussing the potential origins of Charles Sherrington, i.e. whether he was born in India of unknown parents, or was the illegitimate child of Caleb Rose and Anne Sherrington.

Erling Norrby, PhD, in &quot;Nobel Prizes and Notable Discoveries&quot; (2016) observed: &quot;His family origin apparently is not properly given in his official biography. Considering that motherhood is a matter of fact and fatherhood a matter of opinion, it can be noted that his father was not James Norton Sherrington, from whom his family name was derived. Charles was born 9 years after the death of his presumed father. Instead Charles and his two brothers were the illegitimate sons of Caleb Rose, a highly regarded Ipswich surgeon.&quot;

In &quot;Ipswich Town: A History&quot;, Susan Gardiner writes: &quot;George and William Sherrington, along with their older brother, Charles, were almost certainly the illegitimate sons of Anne Brookes, née Thurtell and Caleb Rose, a leading surgeon from Ipswich, with whom she was living in College Road, Islington at the time that all three boys were born. No father was named in the baptism register of St James&#x27; Church, Clerkenwell, and there is no official record of the registration of any of their births. It was claimed they were the sons of a country doctor, James Norton Sherrington. However, it was with Caleb Rose that Anne and the three Sherrington boys moved to Anglesea Road, Ipswich in 1860 and the couple were married in 1880 after Caleb&#x27;s first wife had died.&quot;

Judith Swazey, in &quot;Reflexes and Motor Integration: Sherrington&#x27;s Concept of Integrative Action&quot; (1969), quotes Charles Scott Sherrington&#x27;s son, Carr Sherrington: &quot;James N. Sherrington was always called Mr. and I have no knowledge that he was a Dr. either in law or in medicine... [He] was mainly interested in art and was a personal friend of J. B. Crone and other painters.&quot;

Caleb Rose was noteworthy as both a classical scholar and an archaeologist. At the family&#x27;s Edgehill House in Ipswich one could find a fine selection of paintings, books, and geological specimens. Through Rose&#x27;s interest in the Norwich School of Painters, Sherrington gained a love of art. Intellectuals frequented the house regularly. It was this environment that fostered Sherrington&#x27;s academic sense of wonder. Even before matriculation, the young Sherrington had read Johannes Müller&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Physiology&quot;. The book was given to him by Caleb Rose.

Sherrington entered Ipswich School in 1871. Thomas Ashe, a famous English poet, taught at the school. Ashe served as an inspiration to Sherrington, instilling a love of classics and the desire to travel.

Rose had pushed Sherrington towards medicine. Sherrington first began to study with the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He also sought to study at Cambridge, but a bank failure had devastated the family&#x27;s finances. Sherrington elected to enroll at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in September 1876 as a &quot;perpetual pupil&quot;. He did so in order to allow his two younger brothers to do so ahead of him. The two studied law there. Medical studies at St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital were intertwined with studies at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Physiology was Sherrington&#x27;s chosen major at Cambridge. There, he studied under the &quot;father of British physiology,&quot; Sir Michael Foster.

Sherrington played football for his grammar school, and for Ipswich Town Football Club; he played rugby for St. Thomas&#x27;s, was on the rowing team at Oxford. During June 1875, Sherrington passed his preliminary examination in general education at the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS). This preliminary exam was required for Fellowship, and also exempted him from a similar exam for the Membership. In April 1878, he passed his Primary Examination for the Membership of the RCS, and twelve months later the Primary for Fellowship.

In October 1879, Sherrington entered Cambridge as a non-collegiate student. The following year he entered Gonville and Caius College. Sherrington was a first-rate student. In June 1881, he took Part I in the Natural Sciences Tripos (NST) and was awarded a &quot;Starred first&quot; in physiology; there were nine candidates in all (eight men, one woman), of whom five gained First-class honours (&quot;Firsts&quot;); in June 1883, in Part II of the NST, he also gained a First, alongside William Bateson. Walter Holbrook Gaskell, one of Sherrington&#x27;s tutors, informed him in November 1881 that he had earned the highest marks for his year in botany, human anatomy, and physiology; second in zoology; and highest overall. John Newport Langley was Sherrington&#x27;s other tutor. The two were interested in how anatomical structure is expressed in physiological function.

Sherrington earned his Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons on 4 August 1884. In 1885, he obtained a First Class in the Natural Science Tripos with the mark of distinction. In the same year, Sherrington earned the degree of M.B., Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery from Cambridge. In 1886, Sherrington added the title of L.R.C.P., Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians.

====Seventh International Medical Congress====

The 7th International Medical Congress was held in London in 1881. It was at this conference that Sherrington began his work in neurological research. At the conference controversy broke out. Friedrich Goltz of Strasbourg argued that localized function in the cortex did not exist. Goltz came to this conclusion after observing dogs who had parts of their brains removed. David Ferrier, who became a hero of Sherrington&#x27;s, disagreed. Ferrier maintained that there was localization of function in the brain. Ferrier&#x27;s strongest evidence was a monkey who suffered from hemiplegia, paralysis affecting one side of the body only, after a cerebral lesion.

A committee, including Langley, was made up to investigate. Both the dog and the monkey were chloroformed. The right hemisphere of the dog was delivered to Cambridge for examination. Sherrington performed a histological examination of the hemisphere, acting as a junior colleague to Langley. In 1884, Langley and Sherrington reported on their findings in a paper. The paper was the first for Sherrington.

====Travel====
In the winter of 1884–1885, Sherrington left England for Strasbourg. There, he worked with Goltz. Goltz, like many others, positively influenced Sherrington. Sherrington later said of Goltz that:
&quot;[h]e taught one that in all things only the best is good enough.&quot;

A case of asiatic cholera had broken out in Spain in 1885. A Spanish doctor claimed to have produced a vaccine to fight the outbreak. Under the auspices of Cambridge University, the Royal Society of London, and the Association for Research in Medicine, a group was put together to travel to Spain to investigate. C.S. Roy, J. Graham Brown, and Sherrington formed the group. Roy was Sherrington&#x27;s friend and the newly elected professor of pathology at Cambridge. As the three travelled to Toledo, Sherrington was skeptical of the Spanish doctor. Upon returning, the three presented a report to the Royal Society. The report discredited the Spaniard&#x27;s claim.

Sherrington did &quot;not&quot; meet Santiago Ramón y Cajal on this trip. While Sherrington and his group remained in Toledo, Cajal was hundreds of miles away in Zaragoza.

Later that year Sherrington travelled to Rudolf Virchow in Berlin to inspect the cholera specimens he procured in Spain. Virchow later on sent Sherrington to Robert Koch for a six weeks&#x27; course in technique. Sherrington ended up staying with Koch for a year to do research in bacteriology. Under these two, Sherrington parted with a good foundation in physiology, morphology, histology, and pathology. During this period he may have also studied with Waldeyer and Zuntz.

In 1886, Sherrington went to Italy to again investigate a cholera outbreak. While in Italy, Sherrington spent much time in art galleries. It was in this country that Sherrington&#x27;s love for rare books became an obsession.

===Employment===

In 1891, Sherrington was appointed as superintendent of the Brown Institute for Advanced Physiological and Pathological Research of the University of London, a center for human and animal physiological and pathological research. Sherrington succeeded Sir Victor Alexander Haden Horsley. There, Sherrington worked on segmental distribution of the spinal dorsal and ventral roots, he mapped the sensory dermatomes, and in 1892 discovered that muscle spindles initiated the stretch reflex. The institute allowed Sherrington to study many animals, both small and large. The Brown Institute had enough space to work with large primates such as apes.

====Liverpool====

Sherrington&#x27;s first job of full-professorship came with his appointment as Holt Professor of Physiology at Liverpool in 1895, succeeding Francis Gotch. With his appointment to the Holt Chair, Sherrington ended his active work in pathology. Working on cats, dogs, monkeys, and apes that had been bereaved of their cerebral hemispheres, he found that reflexes must be considered integrated activities of the total organism, not just the result of activities of the so-called reflex-arcs, a concept then generally accepted. There he continued his work on reflexes and reciprocal innervation. His papers on the subject were synthesized into the Croonian lecture of 1897.

Sherrington showed that muscle excitation was inversely proportional to the inhibition of an opposing group of muscles. Speaking of the excitation-inhibition relationship, Sherrington said &quot;desistence from action may be as truly active as is the taking of action.&quot; Sherrington continued his work on reciprocal innervation during his years at Liverpool. Come 1913, Sherrington was able to say that &quot;the process of excitation and inhibition may be viewed as polar opposites [...] the one is able to neutralize the other.&quot; Sherrington&#x27;s work on reciprocal innervation was a notable contribution to the knowledge of the spinal cord.

====Oxford====
As early as 1895, Sherrington had tried to gain employment at Oxford University. By 1913, the wait was over. Oxford offered Sherrington the Waynflete Chair of Physiology at Magdalen College. The electors to that chair unanimously recommended Sherrington without considering any other candidates. Sherrington enjoyed the honor of teaching many bright students at Oxford, including Wilder Penfield, who he introduced to the study of the brain. Several of his students were Rhodes scholars, three of whom – Sir John Eccles, Ragnar Granit, and Howard Florey – went on to be Nobel laureates. Sherrington also influenced American pioneer brain surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing.

Sherrington&#x27;s philosophy as a teacher can be seen in his response to the question of what was the real function of Oxford University in the world. Sherrington said:

&quot;After some hundreds of years of experience we think that we have learned here in Oxford how to teach what is known. But now with the undeniable upsurge of scientific research, we cannot continue to rely on the mere fact that we have learned how to teach what is known. We must learn to teach the best attitude to what is not yet known. This also may take centuries to acquire but we cannot escape this new challenge, nor do we want to.&quot; 

 While at Oxford, Sherrington kept hundreds of microscope slides in a specially constructed box labelled &quot;Sir Charles Sherrington&#x27;s Histology Demonstration Slides&quot;. As well as histology demonstration slides, the box contains slides which may be related to original breakthroughs such as cortical localization in the brain; slides from contemporaries such as Angelo Ruffini and Gustav Fritsch; and slides from colleagues at Oxford such as John Burdon-Sanderson – the first Waynflete Chair of Physiology – and Derek Denny-Brown, who worked with Sherrington at Oxford (1924–1928)).

Sherrington&#x27;s teachings at Oxford were interrupted by World War I. When the war started, it left his classes with only nine students. During the war, he laboured at a shell factory to support the war and to study fatigue in general, but specifically industrial fatigue. His weekday work hours were from 7:30am to 8:30pm; and from 7:30am to 6:00pm on the weekends.

In March 1916, Sherrington fought for women to be admitted to the medical school at Oxford.

He lived at 9 Chadlington Road in north Oxford from 1916 to 1934, and on 28 April 2022 an Oxfordshire blue plaque in his honour was unveiled on this house.

===Retirement===
Charles Sherrington retired from Oxford in the year of 1936. He then moved to his boyhood town of Ipswich, where he built a house. There, he kept up a large correspondence with pupils and others from around the world. He also continued to work on his poetic, historical, and philosophical interests. From 1944 until his death he was President of the Ipswich Museum, on the committee he had previously served.

Sherrington&#x27;s mental faculties were crystal clear up to the time of his sudden death, which was caused by a sudden heart failure at age 94. His bodily health, however, did suffer in old age. Arthritis was a major burden. Speaking of his condition, Sherrington said &quot;old age isn&#x27;t pleasant[,] one can&#x27;t do things for oneself.&quot; The arthritis put Sherrington in a nursing home in the year before his death, in 1951.

==Family==
On 27 August 1891, Sherrington married Ethel Mary Wright (died 1933), daughter of John Ely Wright of Preston Manor, Suffolk, England. They had one child, a son named Charles (&quot;Carr&quot;) E.R. Sherrington, who was born in 1897.

On weekends during the Oxford years the couple would frequently host a large group of friends and acquaintances at their house for an enjoyable afternoon.

==Publications==
===&quot;The Integrative Action of the Nervous System&quot;===
Published in 1906, this was a compendium of ten of Sherrington&#x27;s Silliman lectures, delivered at Yale University in 1904.

The book discussed neuron theory, the &quot;synapse&quot; (a term he had introduced in 1897, the word itself suggested by classicist A. W. Verrall), communication between neurons, and a mechanism for the reflex-arc function. The work effectively resolved the debate between neuron and reticular theory in mammals, thereby shaping our understanding of the central nervous system.

He theorized that the nervous system coordinates various parts of the body and that the reflexes are the simplest expressions of the interactive action of the nervous system, enabling the entire body to function toward a definite purpose. Sherrington pointed out that reflexes must be goal-directive and purposive. Furthermore, he established the nature of postural reflexes and their dependence on the anti-gravity stretch reflex and traced the afferent stimulus to the proprioceptive end organs, which he had previously shown to be sensory in nature (&quot;proprioceptive&quot; was another term he had coined). The work was dedicated to Ferrier.

===&quot;Mammalian Physiology: a Course of Practical Exercises&quot;===
The textbook was published in 1919 at the first possible moment after Sherrington&#x27;s arrival at Oxford and the end of the War.

===&quot;The Assaying of Brabantius and other Verse&quot;===
This collection of previously published war-time poems was Sherrington&#x27;s first major poetic release, published in 1925. Sherrington&#x27;s poetic side was inspired by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Sherrington was fond of Goethe the poet, but not Goethe the scientist. Speaking of Goethe&#x27;s scientific writings, Sherrington said &quot;to appraise them is not a congenial task.&quot;

===&quot;Man on His Nature&quot;===
A reflection on Sherrington&#x27;s philosophical thought. Sherrington had long studied the 16th century French physician Jean Fernel, and grew so familiar with him that he considered him a friend. During the academic year 1937-38, Sherrington delivered the Gifford lectures at the University of Edinburgh. They focused on Fernel and his times, and formed the basis of &quot;Man on His Nature.&quot; The book was published in 1940, with a revised edition in 1951. It explores philosophical thoughts about the mind, human existence, and God, in accordance with natural theology. In the original edition, each of the twelve chapters begins with one of the twelve zodiac signs; Sherrington discusses astrology in Fernel&#x27;s time in Chapter 2. In his ideas on mind and cognition, Sherrington introduced the idea that neurons work as groups in a &quot;million-fold democracy&quot; to produce outcomes rather than with central control.

==Honours and awards==

===Eponyms===

;Liddell-Sherrington reflex: Associated with Edward George Tandy Liddell and Charles Scott Sherrington, the Liddell-Sherrington reflex is the tonic contraction of muscle in response to its being stretched. When a muscle lengthens beyond a certain point, the myotatic reflex causes it to tighten and attempt to shorten. This can be felt as tension during stretching exercises.

;Schiff-Sherrington reflex: Associated with Moritz Schiff and Charles Scott Sherrington, describes a grave sign in animals: rigid extension of the forelimbs after damage to the spine. It may be accompanied by paradoxical respiration – the intercostal muscles are paralysed and the chest is drawn passively in and out by the diaphragm.

;Sherrington&#x27;s First Law: Every posterior spinal nerve root supplies a particular area of the skin, with a certain overlap of adjacent dermatomes.

;Sherrington&#x27;s Second Law: The law of reciprocal innervation. When contraction of a muscle is stimulated, there is a simultaneous inhibition of its antagonist. It is essential for coordinated movement.

;Vulpian-Heidenhain-Sherrington phenomenon: Associated with Rudolf Peter Heinrich Heidenhain, Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian, and Charles Scott Sherrington. Describes the slow contraction of denervated skeletal muscle by stimulating autonomic cholinergic fibres innervating its blood vessels.

<text>This is a list of [[Member of the European Parliament|members of the European Parliament]] serving in the sixth term (2004–2009). It is sorted by an English perception of surname treating all variations of de/di/do, van/von, Ó, and so forth as part of the collation key, even if this is not the normal practice in a member&#x27;s own country.

This list was initially published by the Parliament at the convening on 20 July 2004, amended on 21 July when the Lega Nord affiliated to the Independence and Democracy group, and then further updated with replacements. Members from Bulgaria and Romania, appointed by their parliaments, became full members on 1 January 2007; some of these participated in the formation of the new Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group in the following sitting of the Parliament, but this broke up later the same year.

<doc id="772670" wikidata="Q54684" url="?curid=772670" title="Bill Tilden">
<text>William Tatem Tilden II (February 10, 1893 – June 5, 1953), nicknamed &quot;Big Bill&quot;, was an American tennis player. He was the world No. 1 amateur for six consecutive years, from 1920 to 1925, and was ranked as the world No. 1 professional by Ray Bowers in 1931 and 1932 and Ellsworth Vines in 1933. Tilden won 14 Major singles titles, including 10 Grand Slam events, one World Hard Court Championships and three professional majors. He was the first American man to win Wimbledon, first claiming the title in 1920. He also won a joint-record seven U.S. Championships titles (shared with Richard Sears and Bill Larned).

Tilden dominated the world of international tennis in the first half of the 1920s, and during his 20-year amateur period from 1911 to 1930, won 138 of 192 tournaments he contested. He owns a number of all-time tennis achievements, including the career match-winning record and the career winning percentage at the U.S. Championships. At the 1929 U.S. National Championships, Tilden became the first player to reach ten finals at the same Grand Slam event. Tilden, who was frequently at odds with the rigid United States Lawn Tennis Association about his amateur status and income derived from newspaper articles, won his last Grand Slam event in 1930 at Wimbledon at the age of 37. He turned professional at the end of that year and toured with other professionals for the next 15 years.

==Personal life==
William Tatem Tilden Jr. was born on February 10, 1893, in Germantown, Philadelphia into a wealthy family bereaved by the death of three older siblings. His father was William Tatem Tilden, a wool merchant and local politician; and his mother, Selina Hey, was a pianist. His semi-invalid mother, who suffered from Bright&#x27;s disease, died when he was 18; and, even though his father was still alive and maintained a large house staffed with servants, Bill was sent a few houses away to live with a maiden aunt. The loss at 22 of his father and an older brother Herbert marked him deeply. After several months of deep depression and, with encouragement from his aunt, tennis, which he had taken up at age six or seven at the family summer house in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York, became his primary means of recovery. According to his biographer, Frank Deford, because of his early family losses, Tilden spent all of his adult life attempting to create a father-son relationship with a long succession of ball boys and youthful tennis protégés, of whom Vinnie Richards was the most noted. In spite of his worldwide travels, Tilden lived at his aunt&#x27;s house until 1941, when he was 48 years old.

Tilden was initially home-schooled by his overprotective mother and a team of private tutors; but, in 1908, he went to Germantown Academy. In October 1910 he entered the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined Delta Kappa Epsilon, and enrolled at Peirce College but did not graduate.

==Early and amateur tennis career==
Tilden went to the prep school Germantown Academy where he wasn&#x27;t known for his tennis nor was he eventually good enough to play on his college team. The shy, self-absorbed, sometimes arrogant young man dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and in 1910 began to practice his game against a backboard, and he also became a dedicated student of the game. The following year he won his first tournaments; the junior singles and doubles title of Germantown. In just three years, he worked his way up the ranks. His first national title was winning the mixed doubles championships with Mary Browne in 1913 and they successfully defended the title in 1914.

From 1914 to 1917, Tilden won the Philadelphia championship. Prior to 1920, he had won a number of Canadian doubles titles, but at the U.S. National Championships in 1918 and 1919 he lost the singles final to Robert Lindley Murray and &quot;Little Bill&quot; Johnston, respectively in straight sets. He won six consecutive U.S. singles championships from 1920 to 1925 and seven in total, making him the co-record holder with Richard Sears and Bill Larned. In the winter of 1919–1920, he moved to Rhode Island, where, on an indoor court, he devoted himself to remodeling his relatively ineffective backhand into a much more effective one. With this change, he became the world No. 1 tennis player and the first male American to win the Wimbledon singles championship. In the mid-1920s, Tilden came into conflict with the USLTA regarding alleged violations of the amateur rule, specifically relating to the monetary compensation he received for writing tennis articles.

In the late 1920s, the great French players known as the &quot;Four Musketeers&quot; finally wrested the Davis Cup away from Tilden and the United States, as well as his domination of the singles titles at Wimbledon and Forest Hills. In 1928, he won the men&#x27;s singles in the Ojai Tennis Tournament. Tilden had long been at odds with the rigid amateur directors of the United States Lawn Tennis Association about his income derived from newspaper articles about tennis. He won his last major championship at Wimbledon in 1930 at the age of 37, but was no longer able to win titles at will.

==Professional tennis career==
On December 31, 1930, in need of money, he turned professional and joined the fledgling pro tour, which had begun only in 1927. For the next 15 years, he and a handful of other professionals such as Hans Nüsslein and Karel Koželuh barnstormed across the United States and Europe in a series of one-night stands, with Tilden still the player that people primarily paid to see. Tilden beat Koželuh 50–17 on the 1931 tour. Even with greats such as Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry, and Don Budge as his opponents, all of them current or recent world No. 1 players, it was often Tilden who ensured the box-office receipts—and who could still hold his own against the much younger players for a first set or even an occasional match. Tilden was ranked world No. 1 pro by Ray Bowers in 1931 and 1932 and Ellsworth Vines in 1933.

Tilden thought he reached the apogee of his whole career in 1934 at 41 years old; nevertheless, that year he was dominated in the pro ranks by Ellsworth Vines. &quot;American Lawn Tennis&quot; reported that Vines had an edge of 11–9 in the first phase of their tour from January 10 through February 16 and that Vines led Tilden by 19 matches after the second phase of their tour, played from March 21 through May 17. Tilden had won 17 times for the entire year, per an Associated Press report, so a probable win–loss record at tour&#x27;s end was 36–17 in Vines&#x27; favor. Both players then met at least 6 times during the rest of the year (Ray Bowers has listed 5 tournament matches and 1 one-night program), all lost by Tilden.

In May 1931 he won the inaugural U.S. National Indoor Professional Championships, held at the Penn Athletic Club, Philadelphia against Vincent Richards. Later in July that year Tilden won his first U.S. Pro title, beating Vincent Richards in the final in straight sets at the Forest Hill Stadium in New York. Tilden also won the French Pro title in 1934. In 1935, he took his second US Pro title beating Kozeluh in the final. The same season he was beaten in the final of the Pacific Southwest Indoor Professional Championships in November by Lester Stoefen. By the late 1930s, Tilden was in his mid 40s and past his prime, but he was capable of playing excellent tennis in patches. Tilden lost easily to Don Budge in the 1941 World Series. Budge said of Tilden &quot;Bill could invariably manage to keep things close for a while. It was seldom, however, that he could extend me to the end, and I swamped him on the whole tour&quot;.

In 1945, the 52-year-old Tilden and his long-time doubles partner Vinnie Richards won the professional doubles championship—they had won the United States amateur title 27 years earlier in 1918.

After playing the pro tournament circuit in 1946, the 53-year-old Tilden served a jail term. He returned to pro tennis briefly in 1948, playing a short series of matches against Wayne Sabin. Tilden&#x27;s final farewell came in 1951. He faced George Lyttleton Rogers in a tour in April and May. Tilden lost in the quarterfinals to Frank Kovacs at the Cleveland tournament in June 1951. Tilden was 58 years old. It had been 35 years earlier, in 1916, that he had made his singles debut at the US (Amateur) championships.

===Davis Cup coach===
Tilden coached Germany&#x27;s tennis team in the 1937 Davis Cup. In the inter-zone finals, the U.S. team won after the deciding singles clash between Gottfried von Cramm and Don Budge, a match which has been called &quot;The Greatest Tennis Match Ever Played&quot;.

Tilden is considered by some to be the greatest tennis player of all time.
Allison Danzig, the main tennis writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1923 through 1968, and the editor of &quot;The Fireside Book of Tennis&quot;, called Tilden the greatest tennis player he had ever seen. &quot;He could run like a deer,&quot; Danzig once told CBS Sports. An extended Danzig encomium to Tilden&#x27;s tennis appears in the July 11, 1946 issue of &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he reports on a 1920s-evoking performance in the first two sets of a five-set loss by the 53-year-old Tilden to Wayne Sabin, at the 1946 Professional Championship at Forest Hills.

In 1975, Don Budge ranked his top five players of all time and rated Tilden number four behind Vines, Kramer and Perry.

In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player, included Tilden in his list of the six greatest players of all time. Kramer began playing tennis with Tilden at age 15 at the Los Angeles Tennis Club (LATC).

In 1983, Fred Perry ranked the greatest male players of all time and put them in to two categories, before World War 2 and after. Perry ranked Tilden number one in the pre-World War 2 list.

In the early years of the 21st century, Sidney Wood compiled his list of the Greatest Players of All Time (later published posthumously in a memoir &quot;The Wimbledon final that never was and other tennis tales from a bygone era&quot;). Wood first entered Wimbledon in 1927 and won the title in 1931. &quot;From that time on, through to the late 1970s (doubles only towards the end), I was privileged to compete against virtually every top player in the world&quot; said Wood. Wood ranked Tilden number three, behind Budge and Kramer.

Tilden was one of the most famous athletes in the world for many years. During his lifetime he was a flamboyant character who was never out of the public eye, acting in both movies and plays, as well as playing tennis. He also had two arrests for sexual misconduct with teenage boys in the late 1940s; these led to incarcerations in the Los Angeles area. After his convictions he was shunned in public. Philadelphia&#x27;s Germantown Cricket Club, his home court, revoked his membership and took down his portrait. Tilden&#x27;s criminal record has cast a long shadow: in March 2016, a proposal to honor him with a historical marker at the club was voted down by the state of Pennsylvania panel charged with evaluating nominations. In 1950, in spite of his legal record and public disgrace, an Associated Press poll named Tilden the greatest tennis player of the half-century by a wider margin than that given to any athlete in any other sport (310 out of 391 votes). He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959.

In the United States&#x27; sports-mad decade of the Roaring Twenties, Tilden was one of the six dominant figures of the &quot;Golden Age of Sport&quot;, along with Babe Ruth, Howie Morenz, Red Grange, Bobby Jones, and Jack Dempsey.

== Sexuality and morals charges==
Tilden was arrested in November 1946 on Sunset Boulevard by the Beverly Hills police and charged with a misdemeanor (&quot;contributing to the delinquency of a minor&quot;) for soliciting an underage boy, a 14-year-old boy with whom he was having sex in a moving vehicle. He was sentenced to a year in prison, but served months. His five-year parole conditions were so strict they virtually erased all his income from private lessons. He was arrested again in January 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old hitchhiker who remained anonymous until years later when he filed a lawsuit claiming he had suffered severe mental, physical, and emotional damage from the encounter. The judge sentenced Tilden to a year on probation violation and let the punishment for the charge run concurrently. Tilden served 10 months.

In both cases, he apparently sincerely believed that his celebrity and his longtime friendship with Hollywood names such as Charlie Chaplin were enough to keep him from jail. After his incarceration, he was increasingly shunned by the tennis and Hollywood world. He was unable to give lessons at most clubs and even on public courts, he had fewer clients. At one point, he was invited to play at a prestigious professional tournament being held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel; at the last moment, he was told that he could not participate. Chaplin allowed Tilden to use his private court for lessons to help him after the run of legal and financial problems.

According to contemporary George Lott, a player and later tennis coach at DePaul University, and authoritative biographer Frank Deford, Tilden never made advances to players, whether other adults or his pupils. Art Anderson of Burbank, who took lessons from Tilden from the age of 11 and remained a lifelong loyal friend, reported that Tilden never made advances toward him. “Bill had all the rumors floating around about his sexuality,” Jack Kramer said.
==Death==
Tilden had been born to wealth, and he earned large sums of money during his long career, particularly in his early years on the pro tour; he spent it lavishly, keeping a suite at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City. Much of his income went toward financing Broadway shows that he wrote, produced, and starred in. The latter part of his life was spent quietly and away from his family, occasionally participating in celebrity tennis matches. He died in his apartment at 2025 North Argyle in Los Angeles, California. He was preparing to leave for the United States Professional Championship tournament in Cleveland, Ohio in 1953 when he died from heart complications at age 60. Tilden is buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1959.

==Career statistics==

Bud Collins states that, as an amateur (1912–1930), Tilden won 138 of 192 tournaments, lost 28 finals and had a 907–62 match record, a 93.6% winning percentage. Although he never played at the Australian Championships, Tilden was the first male tennis player to win four consecutive Grand Slam titles. In 1921, the Australian Championships were held after the U.S. National Championships. He joined professional tennis in 1931, making him then ineligible to compete in Grand Slam tournaments. He owns a number of all-time tennis achievements, including an amateur career match-winning record of 93.6%.

Tilden&#x27;s career winning percentage at the US National Championships was 90.7%, which ranks him first ahead of Roger Federer, Fred Perry and Pete Sampras, and also a 42-match win streak from 1920 to 1926 is ahead of Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl. His 95-match winning streak from 1924 to 1925 is ahead of Don Budge and Roy Emerson, and his best win–loss single season coming in 1925 at 98.73%, 78–1, places him ahead of John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. He, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are the only players to reach 10 finals at a single Grand Slam event. At the Wimbledon Championships, he recorded a career 91.2% match record, ranking him 3rd all-time behind Björn Borg and Don Budge.

<doc id="772678" wikidata="Q513379" url="?curid=772678" title="Barriemore Barlow">
<text>Barrie &quot;Barriemore&quot; Barlow (born 10 September 1949, Birmingham) is an English musician, best known as the drummer and percussionist for the rock band Jethro Tull, from May 1971 to June 1980.

Christened Barrie, &#x27;Barriemore&#x27; was an affectation to suit the eccentric image of Jethro Tull (much as Jeffrey Hammond had become &quot;Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond&quot;).

==Early career==
Barlow first met Ian Anderson and John Evans (credited as John Evan on Jethro Tull albums) in Blackpool, where the two were members of a beat group, The Blades. He left a career as an apprentice plastic mould tool fitter to start playing full-time with Anderson and Evan&#x27;s band. However, his first public appearance was not as a musician, but as a TV extra in the series &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in which he briefly appeared alongside Anderson&#x27;s then-girlfriend, actress Yvonne Nickelson. 

After leaving The John Evan Band, as The Blades were by then known, Barlow joined another local group &quot;The All Jump Kangaroo Band&quot; featuring and run by Andy Trueman, who became the production manager for Jethro Tull in 1995.

==With Jethro Tull==
Barlow joined Jethro Tull in 1971, after the departure of Clive Bunker. Barlow played on the EP &quot;Life&#x27;s a Long Song&quot;, before embarking on a concert tour with the band. At this point Jethro Tull included all the original members of The Blades, with the addition of Martin Barre, and it became a relatively long-running edition of the Jethro Tull lineup (late 1971–1975).

Barlow&#x27;s first gig with Tull involved an unfortunate episode in Denver, Colorado, when the local police tear-gassed the audience from helicopters, both outside and inside the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Believing that they would be arrested, the band made a run for it after the show in an unmarked station wagon where, hidden under a blanket on the floor in the back, Barlow was heard to ask Anderson, &quot;Will it be like this every night?&quot; Anderson replied, &quot;As a general rule, only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.&quot;

Upset by the death of bassist John Glascock, with whom he had become very close, Barlow left Jethro Tull in 1980 after completing the final leg of the &quot;Stormwatch&quot; tour.

==As a session musician==
After leaving Jethro Tull, Barlow went on to do various session projects, including work with Robert Plant, John Miles, and Jimmy Page, and was one of the few drummers that Plant and Page considered as a remote possibility to replace John Bonham in Led Zeppelin after his death, though the band decided to break up instead. He also briefly started his own band called Storm. He played on Kerry Livgren&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Seeds of Change&quot; (1980), and Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Rising Force&quot; (1984).

Barlow played concerts in a group called Tandoori Cassette in the mid 1980s, with Zal Cleminson, on guitar, Charlie Tumahai on bass and Ronnie Leahy on keyboards. No albums were released from Tandoori Cassette, but they can be heard in a release of &#x27;Angel Talk&#x27; and &#x27;Third World Briefcases&#x27; on Youtube. Tandoori Cassette disbanded after a few years. 

Barlow has a recording studio, The Doghouse, on his property in Shiplake, Oxfordshire, England. He is currently managing a band from Henley on Thames called The Repertoires, and has also been linked with other local bands which echo his own folk-influenced musical history, such as Reading&#x27;s Smokey Bastard.

Barlow played percussion on &quot;Artrocker,&quot; the opening track of the 2006 album &quot;Get Your Mood On&quot; by London indie punk band Dustin&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah.

On 28 May 2008 Barlow guested with Jethro Tull at Royal Festival Hall in London, performing &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;, &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; and a concert-closing &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, where he and Doane Perry both played the drums.

==Drumming technique==
Barlow is known as a very technical and creative drummer. He was called &quot;the greatest rock drummer England ever produced&quot; by John Bonham.
In a comment on his drumming for the Jethro Tull albums he said; &quot;I&#x27;ve always admired people who invent—and on a percussion level, I admire inventors of rhythm. I tried to strive for that in Tull, but now I go to great lengths to advise the drummers in the bands I&#x27;m managing not to play anything like I used to play in Tull, because it was so busy and over-the-top.&quot; Barlow has cited Joe Morello, Buddy Rich, Ringo Starr and Michael Giles as being among his primary influences.

<doc id="772680" wikidata="Q6735695" url="?curid=772680" title="Mail Order Monsters">
<text>Mail Order Monsters is an action-strategy computer game created by Paul Reiche III, Evan Robinson, and Nicky Robinson. It was published by Electronic Arts (Ariolasoft in Europe) for the Commodore 64 in 1985, then released for Atari 8-bit computers in 1986. Players create monsters which they can use to battle multiplayer or against computer-controlled opponents.

== Gameplay ==
The players create a variety of monsters and equip them with futuristic and modern weapons to do battle. Monsters can be further customized through buying special abilities, such as adding tentacles to use advanced weaponry. Two players can fight against each other, play capture the flag, or compete for a high score against a computer-controlled horde. In single-player mode, the computer controls an opponent to fight. Battles take place on various different maps that can have tactical effects, such as mountains for agile monsters to hide behind during combat. Monsters can be stored on diskette and can be upgraded by victories against other monsters or computer opponents.

==Development==
Reiche had previously worked with designers Jon Freeman and Anne Westfall of Free Fall Associates on the game &quot;&quot; for EA. The game was originally envisioned as dark and gritty, but Electronic Arts demanded a more whimsical style. During this development, Reiche became fascinated with his friend Greg Johnson&#x27;s development on &quot;Starflight&quot;, and spent a few weeks consulting on it before he realized he was &quot;supposed to be working on &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot;&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Ahoy!&quot; stated that &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot; for Commodore 64 was a &quot;very good game&quot; that did not reach &quot;true excellence&quot; because of insufficient combat tactics, and suggested that it was best for younger players. The magazine later described the game as &quot;pure light-hearted mayhem&quot;, with exciting action that partially compensated for &quot;the lack of mental challenge&quot;. Writing in &quot;Vintage Games&quot;, Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton identify it as a precursor to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series.

In a retrospective, Levi Buchanan of IGN said that although he would love to see a remake, any new version, updated to suit modern gamers, would necessarily have to diverge from what made the game unique in 1985.

<doc id="772694" wikidata="Q725147" url="?curid=772694" title="John Evan">
<text>John Evan (born John Spencer Evans; born 28 March 1948, in Derby, Derbyshire) is a British musician and composer. He is best known as the keyboardist for Jethro Tull from April 1970 to June 1980.

==Early life==
Evans&#x27; father was headmaster at a Derbyshire village school and his mother was a local concert pianist and piano teacher. The family moved to Blackpool, Lancashire in October 1949. Evans was educated at Blackpool Grammar School, where he met Ian Anderson and Jeffrey Hammond, and Chelsea College, now King&#x27;s College London.

==Career==
Evans changed his name when his first band, The Blades, changed their name to The John Evan Band. Jeffrey Hammond apparently thought &#x27;The John Evan Band&#x27; sounded better than &#x27;The John Evans Band&#x27;. He participated in the Blackpool musical scene, with most of the musicians that would become Jethro Tull, including Barrie Barlow, Jeffrey Hammond, Glenn Cornick and Ian Anderson.

Later on, Evan was attending college when he happened to recognize his then future bandmates on the radio with the song &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, remarking years later that it stood out to him because of its quite unusual time signature for a pop song ().

===Jethro Tull===
In 1970, he played as a session musician on Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Benefit&quot; album (where his acknowledgement reads: &quot;...and John Evan, who played keyboards for our &#x27;benefit&#x27;&quot;), and was eventually convinced by Ian Anderson to leave school to become a full-fledged member of the band. In addition to his many distinctive contributions to the group&#x27;s overall musical sound and stage personality, it is also notable that Evan composed the memorable piano introduction to &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, having achieved this task in studio while some of the other band members were out to lunch.

Whilst with Jethro Tull, Evan had a penchant for wearing his trademark white suit, along with a yellow shirt underneath and a pink-and-yellow polka-dot tie. Evan can be seen wearing this outfit in photographs on the album &quot;War Child&quot;, and the live album &quot;Bursting Out&quot;, while a painted version of him is seen wearing the suit and tie on the inside cover of the &quot;Aqualung&quot; album. During concerts, Evan&#x27;s wildly rendered pantomime gestures would conjure visions for audiences of a cross between Harpo Marx and The Hatter from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (sans the hat). Because of the familiar white suit, Anderson was known to jokingly refer to Evan (during band member introductions) as &quot;everyone&#x27;s favourite ice cream salesman&quot;.

==After Jethro Tull==
Evan departed Jethro Tull in July 1980, with the &quot;Big Split&quot; of the band. He then went on to form Tallis with fellow departing Tull member, Dee Palmer.

<text>Aldo Nadi (29 April 1899 – 10 November 1965) was an Italian fencing champion.

==Biography==

Aldo was born into a fencing family in Livorno, Italy, and both Aldo and his brother Nedo Nadi were fencers from a very young age. They were both taught foil and sabre in the classical Italian school of swordsmanship by their father, Beppe Nadi, who believed the épée to be an &quot;undisciplined&quot; weapon and refused to teach it. The brothers therefore practiced épée by themselves.

In 1920, at the age of 21, Nadi won gold medals at the Olympics in team foil, team épée, and team sabre. He also won a silver medal in individual sabre, second only to his brother Nedo Nadi.

Nadi emigrated to the United States in 1935. He taught fencing in New York City from 1935 to 1943, and in 1943 published a book &quot;On Fencing&quot;. Also in 1943, he relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he continued to teach fencing in his own school, in addition to occasionally coaching actors for fencing scenes in films. He even made a film appearance himself, as a bodyguard in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), starring Humphrey Bogart.

In 1955, Nadi wrote his autobiography (&quot;The Living Sword: A Fencer&#x27;s Autobiography&quot;), which was published 30 years after his death. 

Nadi died in his sleep, at his home in Los Angeles, California, on 10 November 1965.

Nadi was known for his real-life duels. At the 1920 Olympics, he fought Italian weightlifter Filippo Bottino with a riding whip, while Bottino used a wooden beam. The duel ended very quickly as Nadi struck Bottino&#x27;s hand, causing him to drop the weapon. Later Nadi fought and severely injured a journalist who had mocked him. He also challenged a fellow fencing champion Edoardo Mangiarotti because he felt that Mangiarotti was favored to him by the Italian Olympic Committee. Nadi proposed to use pistols, which Mangiarotti declined.

<doc id="772703" wikidata="Q38156" url="?curid=772703" title="Brittany Spaniel">
<text>The Brittany Spaniel or Breton Spaniel () is a French breed of gun dog of spaniel type, bred primarily for bird hunting.
It developed between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries in Brittany in north-west France, and was officially recognized early in the twentieth. The breed has developed differently in the United States, where it may be referred to as the &#x27;American Brittany&#x27;.

== History ==
The name &quot;Brittany&quot; is taken from the Brittany region in northwestern France where the dog originated. Images of orange and white Brittany-like dogs hunting and retrieving game were first seen on tapestries and paintings from the 17th century. The first written and verifiable record of Brittanys comes from a hunting description written by Reverend Davies in 1850. He described hunting with small &quot;bobtailed&quot; dogs who pointed and were excellent retrievers. It was around the same time that the modern Brittany is rumored to have been bred by mating with English Setters.

The Brittany was first recognized as a breed in 1907 when an orange and white male named Boy was registered in France. As a result, the first standards were outlined in the same year. America recognized the Brittany in 1931 and the breed was approved by the American Kennel Club in 1934. In 1982 the &quot;Spaniel&quot; was officially dropped from the name.

== Description ==


===Appearance===
The Brittany is a dog with a spaniel-type head, a bob-tail, and cobby appearance.

Most Brittanys are born with long tails, subsequently docked to a length of , however sometimes they are born with short tails.

The breed&#x27;s coat color is varied: an orange and white coat or liver and white are most common in the American Brittany; other colors include orange roan and liver roan, all of which are acceptable in the show ring. The American Brittany Standard specifies an acceptable tri-color of liver, orange, and white with very specific color placement. French Brittanys also come in white and black.

===Size===
Brittanys are medium-sized dogs, with American lines ( at the withers according to an AKC standard adopted in 1990 tending to be larger and have a blockier head than French (), and females at the lower end. A properly constructed and healthy Brittany maintains a weight between , depending upon height. Generally, Brittanys are smaller than setters but leggier than spaniels.

====Types====
Many breeders differentiate between &quot;American&quot; Brittanys and &quot;French&quot;-style dogs. Although generally recognized as subsets of the same breed, there are recognizable differences between the two. The &quot;American Brittany&quot; has been bred to be typically larger than the &quot;French Brittany&quot;.

===Temperament===
The Brittany was originally bred as a hunting dog and noted for being easy to train and sweet-natured. The breed is generally more sensitive to correction than other hunters, and harsh corrections are often unnecessary.

==Health==

A 2015 French study found an average life expectancy of 12.6 years. A 2024 UK study found an average life expectancy of 11.1 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

A North American study looking at over a million dogs found the Brittany to be predisposed to hip dysplasia with 4.22% of Brittanys having hip dysplasia compared to 3.52% overall. Another North American study looking at over 250,000 elbow records found the Brittany to have the 14th lowest rate of elbow dysplasia out of 60 breeds with 1.7% of Brittanys having elbow dysplasia.

A North American study found the Brittany to have a higher incidence of glaucoma than other dogs with 0.95% of Brittanys having glaucoma compared to 0.89% overall.

<doc id="772709" wikidata="Q1155222" url="?curid=772709" title="Mahoromatic">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written by Bunjūrō Nakayama and illustrated by Bow Ditama. The series follows Mahoro, a female android former soldier who, driven by guilt from her actions during her combat days, decides to dedicate the rest of her life to serving the son of her late commander as a maid. Originally serialized by Wani Books in &quot;Comic Gum&quot; magazine between 1998 and 2004, it was also compiled into eight tankōbon volumes.

An anime adaptation of &quot;Mahoromatic&quot; produced by studios Gainax and Shaft aired in Japan from October to December 2001, and was followed by a second season airing from September 2002 to January 2003.

==Characters==

===Misato residence===
 (CODE: V1046-R MAHORO)
:Mahoro is an android created by VESPER to fight an alien invasion by &quot;Saint&quot; during the 1980s. She is fast and immensely powerful, and is considered to be a formidable opponent by her enemies.

:Being an android, she has a limited life span. At the beginning of the story, she has just 398 days to live and VESPER gives her the freedom to do anything she wants. She chooses to become a maid for Suguru Misato: his father was her superior officer who was also killed (as collateral damage) when she killed an alien who had taken him hostage.

:Mahoro has a very sunny disposition and is friendly to just about everyone—she becomes a welcome regular at the market and becomes famous at Suguru&#x27;s school when it is made known that she is working for him. She also quickly becomes an excellent cook, able to emulate and recreate dishes from the best restaurants. She is also quite devoted to Suguru, with feelings for him reminiscent of both a doting mother and a shy girlfriend.

: However, she is very hostile towards anything perverted. A good portion of the story&#x27;s humour comes from Mahoro chasing after Suguru&#x27;s secret stash of pornographic magazines which, given her training, she is easily able to find. She is well known for this attitude from her catch phrase: &quot;Ecchi na no wa ikenai to omoimasu&quot; (&quot;I think that dirty thoughts are bad&quot;). Mahoro and Shikijo-sensei&#x27;s dislike of one another stems from the fact that Shikijo is constantly trying to engage in an illicit relationship with Suguru. As such, Mahoro is very protective of Suguru when it comes to Shikijo&#x27;s advances towards him.

:Mahoro is very concerned about appearances, refusing to wear normal clothes given her position as a maid. She is also obsessed with her small breasts, and some stories actually deal with her rivalry with Shikijo (who has very large breasts), as well as her techniques and requests to VESPER for larger breasts.

:Mahoro retains access to many of her weapons and gadgets from her VESPER days, and is able to pull out her gun at any time. She also has access to the &quot;silpheed&quot;, a backpack-like device which when worn on her back, allows her to fly, as well as her support mech, Slash. She is able to call both the Silpheed and Slash at a moment&#x27;s notice from the badge she wears on her maid uniform. In addition, she also owns a fully equipped red 2001 BMW 330Ci convertible and MV Agusta motorcycle.

:Mahoro was created using Saint alien technology, so she has a true soul and a pure heart. Later in the series it is revealed that Mahoro is directly connected to the memories of Matthew, who occasionally advises her.

:She had no surname until the name Andou (short for android) was created by Suguru.

:Despite being an android, Mahoro (in addition to having feelings and emotions) is also able to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, and feel pain.
* 
:Suguru Misato is a junior high school student living in Tokyo. He lost both his parents earlier—his mother (who was half Saint), and years later, his father. While he believed his father was killed in an accident during a business trip, he was actually a commander (and Mahoro&#x27;s commanding officer) in VESPER and was killed in action during the alien war. Although relatives offered to take him in, he refused and lived alone prior to Mahoro&#x27;s arrival.

:He is smart and has an IQ of 130. He makes a favorable impression on members of the opposite sex. Suguru had a whole stash of dirty magazines which were all thrown away when Mahoro first arrived. Although he continues to try to smuggle them in and hide them, Mahoro will often find them—leading to comical confrontations between the two. Suguru uses a whole range of creative tactics to conceal his magazines, and is capable of running away very fast when being chased.

:Suguru hired a maid because of the filthy state of his house. He was expecting an older woman, and Mahoro&#x27;s arrival completely surprised him. At the end of the series Mahoro and Suguru have fallen in love.

 (CODE: 370) 
:Minawa is first introduced in &quot;Mahoromatic ~Something More Beautiful~&quot;. Clumsy and anemic, she ends up living with Mahoro and Suguru and going to school under the pretext of being Mahoro&#x27;s younger sister. She has a habit of apologizing for everything she does, even when she does nothing wrong. She claims to be a runaway member of The Management, but is later revealed to have been sent to gather information on VESPER&#x27;s battle android Mahoro after being promised a heart in return. However, Mahoro convinces her that the fact that she can cry means she already has a heart. Suguru&#x27;s friend Hamaguchi develops a crush on her, and, despite her shortcomings, it is later insinuated that they form a relationship. It was later revealed that Minawa is not an android but a cyborg, and her body is in horrible shape due to all the experiments performed on her. Near the end of the series, she leaves earth so she can get treatment at Saint&#x27;s home world. At the end of the anime, it is suggested she was completely healed and is with Hamaguchi.

:Like Mahoro, Minawa had no surname until one was created by Suguru, and it better enabled her pretend to be Mahoro&#x27;s little sister.

 (CODE: V1046 R9-SLASH ZERO)
:Slash is known as a &quot;support mech&quot; and assists Mahoro during combat. He has the form of a panther and can be summoned at any time by Mahoro. Although he can speak, his mouth never moves except during times when he expresses emotions. Although used for combat in the past, he often now acts as a guard dog around the Misato residence and a friend to the Misato&#x27;s dog—a role he was not thrilled to take in the beginning.

:He is friendly but tough and will lend a helping paw when asked. Although Mahoro is Slash&#x27;s master, he will now take commands from Suguru: since Suguru is Mahoro&#x27;s employer, he is also her master and thus Slash&#x27;s master as well.

:Near the end of the anime series, he was used to wipe out Management and was last seen standing at the side of the fallen Vesper leader.

:However, (in the manga) he firmly stands by Mahoro&#x27;s side, as she uses her final powers to destroy the asteroid to save mankind.

===Junior high school===
:Saori Shikijo, or Shikijo-sensei, is Suguru&#x27;s perverted Junior High School teacher who finds herself very attracted to him. She has an extreme shota complex, an attraction to young boys, Many jokes in series stem from her attempts to openly physically seduce Suguru, coupled with the myriad ways in which her attempts are foiled by Mahoro.

:She is a beautiful and surprisingly strong woman; something Saori is very proud as well as boastful of. Who also happens to be a heavy drinker and as a result is often broke and unable to afford food. Soon after Mahoro arrives at the Misato household, Shikijo starts inviting herself for dinner on a daily basis despite Mahoro&#x27;s protests.

:Shikijo and Mahoro often compete with each other, often with Suguru as the prize, usually with Mahoro emerging victorious except when it comes to insults. She has much larger breasts than Mahoro, or any other character in the series, which she flaunts when comparing herself to Mahoro or in taunting her. Her large breasts are also a focus of her many attempts to seduce Suguru.

In the manga, it is shown, after the time lapse, that she has yet to age, most likely due to her mentioned strict beauty regimen, and has also become the principal of the junior high school, which has done nothing to dampen her love for young boys.
*
:The blue haired member of the &quot;Triomatic,&quot; Miyuki, whose family owns the local bath house, is very tomboyish by contrast with the other two, but is just as loyal. She and her family have known Suguru since childhood and is his best friend; her father thinks of him as the son he never had. She doesn&#x27;t admit it openly, but she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the forehead after he had come to her rescue from a group of bullies; a conflict which she had started.

In the manga, after the time lapse, Miyuki is shown to have inherited, and still manage, the bath house, alongside her family. She is also shown to be married to Suguru&#x27;s friend and former classmate, Kiyomi Kawahara, with whom she had a child. Despite being separated for so long, Miyuki still cares very deeply for Suguru, and is dismayed that he has yet to be happy or live his own life after Mahoro ceased to function.
* 
:Rin is the brown-haired and tallest member of the &quot;Triomatic.&quot; She is the most ladylike of the three, but is also a skilled martial artist and very loyal. Like Miyuki, she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the cheek during a summer class project involving insects.

:Rin has also the most physically developed breasts of the Triomatic, which at times causes Miyuki and Chizuko consternation. For the most part Rin seems almost embarrassed when the other two complain about her breasts, but as the series goes on she becomes more and more comfortable with her &quot;advantage&quot;, similar to their teacher, Shikijo-sensei.

:Rin&#x27;s family is wealthy (coming from a long military line), and lives in a palatial estate filled with numerous pieces of art.

In the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Rin has now become a teacher at the same junior high school she and her friends had attended when they were younger; similar to when they were younger, she is still the most developed.
* 
:Chizuko is a cheerful and bright, short blonde-haired girl, and is the most innocent of the &quot;Triomatic&quot;. For the most part she treats Suguru as a friend, almost like a brother, and is very loyal. Some of her comments suggest that she loves him as more than a friend, but that she has put them aside, feeling that her love is unrequited, and chooses to simply remain by Suguru’s side anyway. This notion is made somewhat evident when she states that Suguru won’t choose anyone among the “Triomatic”, because he values their friendship more than love.

:Chizuko enjoys food a great deal and has an extremely adept sense of taste, being able to identify the exact restaurant that a dish has come from and the exact origins of ingredients. Chizuko will often scream with absolute delight when she tastes Mahoro&#x27;s cooking. While some initially mistake it as a scream of fear or horror, her friends know that it is a sign of culinary approval.

In the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Chizuko went for her dream and became a popular author, most likely relating to food and taste.
*
:One of Suguru&#x27;s male friends who shares his interest in dirty magazines. He has a crush on Minawa, which causes him much trouble because she doesn&#x27;t understand his attempts to express his interest in her.

At the end of the anime, it is suggested that once Minawa is completely healed, Hamaguchi enters into a relationship with Minawa.
* 
:One of Suguru&#x27;s male friends who also enjoys looking at dirty magazines. He is a kendo student, and is usually with Suguru&#x27;s other friend Toshiya.

In the manga, after the time lapse, Kiyomi is shown to be in a relationship with Suguru&#x27;s friend and former classmate, Miyuki Sakura, and works at the bath house.

===Vesper===

A friend of Mahoro and her primary care giver, Minato is the scientist primarily responsible for the maintenance of Mahoro; he is also constantly asked by Mahoro to give her a bigger bust.

===Saint===

Is a combat android seen in the first series as a science teacher. His task was to investigate the reason Mahoro was living as a maid. He also wanted to finish the battle with her to see who is the strongest android/warrior, during the final battle he discovers the reason she is living as a maid for Suguru and who the true warrior is. In the second series, he decides to live as a human and continues to teach at Suguru&#x27;s school much to the irritation to Slash.

In the end of the anime, he visit the members of the Saint for the last time as they depart to another galaxy.

In the manga version, he marries one of his students whom he saved earlier, and becomes a father of a reborn Mahoro.

===Management===
Introduced in &quot;Something More Beautiful&quot;, Management is a top secret organization that had shaped the world from the shadows throughout its history. They are dedicated to destroying not only Saint, to preserve the order they established from alien influence, but Vesper as well, for having sympathy for Saint.

 (CODE: 227)
A cold-hearted android in the form of a youth who was created by and works under the Management&#x27;s robotics scientist Professor Mephlis during his scheme to take Mahoro for himself. However, Feldrance was actually working for the higher-ups to collect the data that Mephlis gathered on Mahoro. When Mephlis&#x27;s plans failed, Feldrance made his move and killed the scientist before taking the data as his creator&#x27;s lab explodes; he felt no remorse for betraying his creator, coldly pointing out that it was Mephlis, after all, who made Feldrance the way he is.

In the anime, he soon met his untimely end along with the death of Mahoro.

In the manga version, he chops Suguru&#x27;s hands while capturing Mahoro but soon stopped by Slash and Ryuuga. He also witnessed the death of Mahoro to save mankind. In the epilogue, he was one of the last defenses of The Management in Mars. He encounters Suguru who kills him. With his last breath, he asks whether the quest of vengeance gave him satisfaction.

==Endings==

===Anime&#x27;s ending===
The finale is set on a Saint-Earth colony world, 20 years after Mahoro&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; and the mutual defeat of Vesper and Management. Suguru left Japan, deciding never to return, and is now a renegade half-cyborg hunter of the last &quot;Management holdouts.&quot; He has only memories of Earth, and a sole companion who later turns out to be an android and tries to kill him for the bounty on his head.

As Suguru is in critical condition, Mahoro reappears alive, asking to take him home.

===Manga&#x27;s ending===
The ending is set on Earth, 20 years after Mahoro&#x27;s death and the defeat of Management. Suguru has been working as a commander within Vesper, and has just returned to Earth from the final defeat of Management&#x27;s last vestiges.

Unbeknownst to Suguru, Mahoro was reborn as a baby shortly after her death as an android. She has grown up, and remembers Suguru. When Suguru returns from Vesper headquarters expecting to find an empty house, she is there waiting for him.

==Manga==
 manga series by Bow Ditama and Bunjūrō Nakayama was originally serialized in &quot;Comic Gum&quot; magazine between December 1998 and July 26, 2004, and compiled into eight tankōbon volumes published by Wani Books. The special edition of the eight volume contained a crystal Mahoro, as well as a special cover. The English version was published by Tokyopop.

===Volumes===



==Anime==
The manga proved popular, and was adapted into two anime series jointly by Gainax and Shaft: &quot;Mahoromatic: Automatic Maiden&quot; and &quot;&quot;

The first series consisted of twelve episodes and ran from September 10, 2001 to January 28, 2002 on BS-i in Japan, and more or less followed the manga to the third volume. The opening theme is &quot;Kaerimichi&quot; (Our Way Home) by Ayako Kawasumi and the ending theme is &quot;Mahoro de MAMBO&quot; by Triomatic (Asami Sanada, Manabi Mizuno, Yumi Kikuchi). It was directed by Hiroyuki Yamaga and features music by Toshio Masuda. Kazuhiro Takamura (from Gainax) designed the characters and served as chief animation director. Three episodes were outsourced outside of Shaft and Gainax: episode 2, produced at Studio Cats and Yuuhodou; and episode 7, produced at M.S.C.

The second series also followed the manga, culminating in the story&#x27;s end. This series ran from September 26, 2002 till January 16, 2003. The opening theme is &quot;So-re-i-yu&quot; (&quot;Soleil&quot; (French for &quot;Sun&quot;)) by Ayako Kawasumi and the ending theme is &quot;Triomatic Ran! Ran! Ran!&quot; by Triomatic. The second season features the returning staff as the first season, but with Yamaga and Jukki Hanada also taking up the role as series composition writers. Shouji Saeki, who worked on the first series, was also promoted as the series&#x27; assistant director. Episodes 3, 7, and 12 were outsourced to Artland.

Both seasons have an extra episode titled &quot;End Year Special&quot;, shown after episode 10 and 12, respectively. These feature a refresher of all the events so far along with new conversations and discussions between characters.

A television special, &quot;&quot;, set in the days when Minawa had become a regular part of the household, was produced and aired on August 15, 2003.

A two episode special entitled &quot;Mahoromatic: I&#x27;m Home Special&quot; (&quot;Mahoromatic: Tadaima Okaeri&quot;) was announced on August 22, 2009. It aired on October 17 and October 24, 2009. It takes place during the second series, on days 270-268 of Mahoro&#x27;s life timer. The opening theme is &quot;Tadaima no Kaze&quot; (ただいまの風, &quot;Returning Wind&quot;) by Ayako Kawasumi and the ending theme is &quot;[Ma] no Tsuku Bugi!&quot; ([ま]のつくブギ！, &quot;[Or] Take the Boogie&quot;) by Triomatic &amp; Minawa &amp; Mahoro. Saeki, the assistant director of the second season, directed the special, and both Masuda and Takamura returned from the prior seasons.

Originally the anime was licensed by Pioneer Entertainment (later Geneon Entertainment). As of October 2008, ADV Films had announced that they had regained licenses to both &quot;Mahoromatic&quot;, and &quot;Mahoromatic: Something More Beautiful&quot;, through its new Japanese licensor Sentai Filmworks. Currently, the anime is distributed by Sentai Filmworks (however, the &#x27;&quot;Ep00 Special&quot; and &quot;End Year Specials&quot; are absent). They also acquired &quot;Mahoromatic: I&#x27;m Home Special&quot; and released it in 2012, with the English dub produced at Bang Zoom! Entertainment.

&quot;Mahoromatic&quot;, including both seasons and the summer special, is currently available through The Anime Network&#x27;s free video on demand service, found on many cable systems and DirecTV.

<doc id="772715" wikidata="Q454309" url="?curid=772715" title="Martin Barre">
<text>Martin Lancelot Barre (; born 17 November 1946) is an English guitarist best known for his longtime role as lead guitarist of British rock band Jethro Tull, with whom he recorded and toured from 1968 until the band&#x27;s initial dissolution in 2011. Barre played on all of Jethro Tull&#x27;s studio albums from their 1969 album &quot;Stand Up&quot; (replacing Mick Abrahams, who played on their first album) to their 2003 album &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot;. In the early 1990s he began a solo career, and he has recorded several albums as well as touring with his own live band.

He has also played the flute and other instruments such as the mandolin, both on stage for Jethro Tull and in his own solo work.

==Early career==
Martin Barre was born in Kings Heath, Birmingham, England, on 17 November 1946. His father was an engineer who had wanted to play the clarinet professionally. Barre played the flute at his grammar school. When Barre bought his first guitar, his father gave him albums by Barney Kessel, Johnny Smith and Wes Montgomery to broaden his musical perspectives.

In college, he studied architecture at Lanchester Polytechnic (now Coventry University) for three years, but did not complete his studies after failing Spanish and Atomic Science, subjects that he found to have little to do with designing buildings. After designing a road junction in Birmingham, England, he decided that a career in architecture was too boring, and switched to music.

In 1966, he moved to London with his friend, Chris Rodger, who had played the saxophone in their previous band, the Moonrakers. In London, Barre and Rodger got an audition for a band called the Noblemen, who were looking for two saxophonists. Barre bought a tenor saxophone, and after two days&#x27; practice was able to bluff his way through the audition. The band subsequently changed its name to the Motivation, and backed visiting soul artists such as the Coasters, the Drifters and Lee Dorsey. The band evolved through several musical styles, from soul to R&amp;B to pop; in 1967, the band changed its name to the Penny Peeps. By this time, Barre was playing lead guitar. As the Penny Peeps the band released two singles in 1968, &quot;Little Man With a Stick&quot; backed by &quot;Model Village&quot;, and &quot;I See the Morning&quot; backed with &quot;Curly, Knight of the Road&quot;. Finally, in mid-1968, they became a blues band named Gethsemane, and played in pubs all over England, with Barre playing the guitar and flute.

When Gethsemane and the band Jethro Tull played at a blues club called the Van Dyke in Plymouth, the members of the two bands got acquainted. Then, four months later, while Gethsemane was playing in London and about to break up because of lack of money, Jethro Tull&#x27;s manager, Terry Ellis, sent his card up from the audience asking Barre to audition for Jethro Tull. The audition did not go well. Barre was so nervous that he barely played; however, he arranged a second audition. This time, he was offered the job. He spent the Christmas holidays of 1968 learning material that was to become the album &quot;Stand Up&quot;.

==Jethro Tull==
On the first album that Barre recorded with Jethro Tull, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, he said that he was: &quot;terrified because I had just joined the band. It really showed a change in direction for the band and when it was accepted and became a successful album, we gained a lot of confidence. We extended that confidence into the making of &quot;Benefit&quot;, in which we were a lot more at ease.&quot; On the next album, the world success &quot;Aqualung&quot;, Barre was more confident, stating that in the recording: &quot;Everybody [the band] had input into the making of the album.&quot;

In the following period, his solos blended virtuosity with classical music, such as on &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, where the opening track has a four-minute solo, or his piece (shared with Barrie Barlow) &quot;Conundrum&quot; and &quot;Quatrain&quot; on &quot;Bursting Out&quot;. Barre declared that much of the material from Jethro Tull catalogue was written by himself and Ian Anderson, with Anderson getting the credit for writing the lyrics and having the initial idea for the music: &quot;then I, or someone else in the band, contribute parts to it.&quot; Two albums on which Barre is credited with having contributed &quot;additional material&quot;, &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;, are two of those which, he has stated, show his best playing. 

Barre embraced the new Jethro Tull sound on the album &quot;Under Wraps&quot; (1984), despite its foregrounding of synthesisers and relegation of his own guitar work to the background. The album contains two tracks co-authored by him. On his work with Jethro Tull, Barre also stated: &quot;I&#x27;m quite pleased with my playing on &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, which was basically me, Ian and [bassist] Dave Pegg working in the studio for two months, so I had ample time to put a lot of myself into that album.&quot; He is credited on only another two Jethro Tull album tracks: &quot;Hot Mango Flush&quot; from &quot;J-Tull Dot Com&quot; and &quot;Winter Snowscape&quot; from &quot;The Jethro Tull Christmas Album&quot;. Concerning his contribution to Jethro Tull music, Barre stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve done bits and pieces on albums. Sometimes it&#x27;s a riff; sometimes it&#x27;s a little segment of music ... I don&#x27;t mind taking a small role in the writing, and a larger input into the arrangement and playing.&quot;

About the end of his involvement in Tull, Barre stated in 2015 that &quot;It&#x27;s important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again. There will be two solo bands: the Ian Anderson Band and the Martin Barre Band, and long may they exist, and long may they enjoy playing music. I&#x27;m not being pedantic. I always hate to hear, &#x27;Oh, you&#x27;ve left Jethro Tull.&#x27; I haven&#x27;t really. Ian wanted to finish Jethro Tull, wanted to stop the band completely.&quot;

When Anderson reunited Jethro Tull in 2017 for their 50th anniversary tour, Barre was not asked to return.

==Solo work==

On one track of 1994&#x27;s &quot;A Trick of Memory&quot;, Barre plays a guitar given to him by friend Mark Mancina. On the album, King Crimson alumnus Mel Collins plays the saxophone, and Fairport Convention&#x27;s Maartin Allcock and Ric Sanders appear on a couple of tracks, and Andy Giddings plays keyboards. According to the AllMusic review: &quot;the dominant sound is Barre&#x27;s guitars, soaring, crunching, grinding, or noodling gently, either blues or English folk tunes&quot;; to the reviewer, the album is &quot;a decent debut album&quot;. &quot;A Summer Band&quot; was released only in limited edition.

In 2003, on his album &quot;Stage Left&quot;, Barre used an unusual electric guitar style shaped by folk/acoustic and hard rock elements. It was his first album to be released in the United States. In the album, Barre shows his style of playing with &quot;tricky and complicated&quot; melodies, being always &quot;elegant, even when he&#x27;s rocking hard&quot;.

In 2012, with the end of Jethro Tull touring, Barre assembled a band to tour and record the compilation/live titled &quot;Martin Barre&quot;. The line up included former Tull members Jonathan Noyce and Doane Perry (who split duties with drummer Fred Moreau), John Mitchell, and guitarist Pat O&#x27;May.

In 2014, Barre announced that he would tour as an acoustic quartet (including Dan Crisp and Alan Bray) to promote &quot;Away With Words&quot;, which was well received by the &quot;Prog Magazine&quot;, saying that in the album, &quot;Barre has taken an imaginative approach to his own past by readdressing many of his favourite, often more obscure, nuggets from lull&#x27;s [sic] vast cache, chiefly on acoustic guitar.&quot; Later in 2014 a new album was announced to be released that September, called &quot;Order of Play&quot;, which was a louder electric record.

Barre announced his sixth solo album in 2015. Called &quot;Back to Steel&quot;, Barre says the album is a blues rock recording. It was followed by &quot;Roads Less Travelled&quot; in 2018.

Martin Barre commenced a tour of the U.S. in the spring of 2019 to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of his joining Jethro Tull and the release of &quot;Stand Up&quot;. On the tour he was supported by his band consisting Alan Thomson (bass), Dan Crisp (guitar and vocals) and Darby Todd (drums), along with special guests (former Tull members) Dee Palmer on keyboards and Clive Bunker on drums. The band were completed with Ali Humphries and Becca Langsford on backing vocals. The show was presented with a full multimedia backing show provided by fans from The Jethro Tull Group. A new double CD album release was available at the shows. MLB is a celebration of 50 years of Jethro Tull as arranged and performed by Martin, his band and guests.

In August 2019, Barre appeared again at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention.

For 2020, Barre had planned to celebrate 50 years of Jethro Tull music with a world tour. However, most shows were cancelled or rescheduled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Adam Wakeman, Clive Bunker and Dee Palmer were scheduled to be guest musicians in several presentations.

==Playing style==
Barre once said that he tried not to listen to other guitarists so that he would not be influenced by them. He said he never took guitar lessons so that he would not sound like other players. However, one guitarist he has praised and recognized as being an influence is Leslie West, from the American band Mountain.

Reviewers have sometimes described Martin Barre&#x27;s sound as &quot;tricky&quot; and &quot;complicated&quot;, highlighting his ability to compose melodies instead of simply soloing.

==Recognition==
Barre&#x27;s best-known guitar work includes that on the songs &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;, and &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;. His signature solo on the 1971 Jethro Tull standard &quot;Aqualung&quot; was voted by the readers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine as one of the top rock guitar solos of all time. Also, in 2007, this solo was rated one of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine. Authors Pete Brown and HP Newquest named Barre&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot; solo as the 25th-best solo ever in the USA and 20th-best solo ever in the UK.

Dire Straits leader Mark Knopfler, in a 2005 interview, called Barre&#x27;s work with Ian Anderson &quot;magical&quot;. Joe Bonamassa cites Martin Barre as a direct influence, especially in the blues playing of the early albums. Other guitarists like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Eric Johnson also cite Martin Barre as influences. Rush&#x27;s Geddy Lee mentions the &quot;great guitar sounds&quot; of Martin Barre when remembering the album &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;.

<text>The Atrocity Exhibition is an experimental novel of linked stories or &quot;condensed novels&quot; by British writer J. G. Ballard.

The book was originally published in the UK in 1970 by Jonathan Cape. After a 1970 edition by Doubleday &amp; Company had already been printed, Nelson Doubleday Jr. personally cancelled the publication and had the copies destroyed, fearing legal action from some of the celebrities depicted in the book. Thus, the first US edition was published in 1972 by Grove Press under the title Love and Napalm: Export USA. It was made into a film by Jonathan Weiss in 1998.

A revised large format paperback edition, with annotations by the author and illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner, was issued by RE/Search in 1990.

==Conception==
&quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot;, Ballard admitted in 2007, originated in large part from the sudden death of his first wife Mary from pneumonia:I was terribly wounded by my wife&#x27;s death. Leaving me with these very young children, I felt that a crime had been committed by nature against this young woman and her children and I was searching desperately for an explanation [...] To some extent &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot; is an attempt to explain all the terrible violence that I saw around me in the early sixties. It wasn&#x27;t just the Kennedy assassination [...] I think I was trying to look for a kind of new logic that would explain all these events.

Ballard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Assassination Weapon&quot; (later to appear as the third chapter of &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot;) was first published in 1966 in &quot;New Worlds&quot; and was edited by Ballard&#x27;s genre fiction colleague and friend Michael Moorcock. As editor of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, Moorcock aimed to marry the science fiction genre with an avant-garde, speculative tenor. Ballard&#x27;s experimental stories &quot;delighted&quot; Moorcock: &quot;[&#x27;The Assassination Weapon&#x27;] was exactly what I&#x27;d been looking for [...] For me it was exemplary, a flag to wave for authors and readers.&quot; Later that same year, &quot;New Worlds&quot; published the title story-chapter, &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot;. &quot;Ambit&quot; went on to publish &quot;You: Coma: Marilyn Monroe&quot; and &quot;The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race&quot;, also in 1966. Ballard became &quot;Ambit&#x27;s&quot; prose editor in 1967.

==Content and composition==
&quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot; is split up into sections, similar to the style of William S. Burroughs, a writer whom Ballard admired. Burroughs wrote the preface to the book. Though often called a &quot;novel&quot; by critics, such a definition is disputed, because all its parts had an independent life. &quot;Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan,&quot; for example, had three prior incarnations: in the &quot;International Times&quot;, in &quot;Ronald Reagan: The Magazine of Poetry&quot;, and as a freestanding booklet from Unicorn Bookshop, Brighton, all in 1968. All 15 pieces had been printed and some even reprinted before &quot;The Atrocity Exhibition&quot; was published.

Each chapter or story is split up into smaller sections, some of them labelled by part of a continuing sentence; Ballard has called these sections &quot;condensed novels&quot;. There is no clear beginning or end to the book, and it does not follow any of the conventional novelistic standards: the protagonist changes name with each chapter or story (Talbert, Traven, Travis, Talbot, etc.), just as his role and his visions of the world around him seem to change constantly. (Ballard explains in the 1990 annotated edition that the character&#x27;s name was inspired by reclusive novelist B. Traven, whose identity is still not known with certainty.)

The stories describe how the mass media landscape inadvertently invades and splinters the private mind of the individual. Suffering from a mental breakdown, the protagonist – a Dr Nathan who works at a mental hospital – surrenders to a world of psychosis. Traven tries to make sense of the many public events that dominate his world (the death of Marilyn Monroe, the Space Race, Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s much-publicized tracheotomy, and especially the assassination of John F. Kennedy), by restaging them in ways that, to his psychotic mind, gives them a more personal meaning. It is never quite clear how much of the novel &quot;really&quot; takes place, and how much only occurs inside the protagonist&#x27;s own head. Characters whom he kills return again in later chapters (his wife seems to die several times). He travels with a Marilyn Monroe scorched by radiation burns, and with a bomber-pilot of whom he notes that &quot;the planes of his face did not seem to intersect correctly.&quot;

Inner and outer landscapes seem to merge as the ultimate goal of the protagonist is to start World War III, &quot;though not in any conventional sense&quot; – a war that will be fought entirely within his own mind. Bodies and landscapes are constantly confused (&quot;Dr Nathan found himself looking at what seemed a dune top, but was in fact an immensely magnified portion of the skin area over the iliac crest&quot;, &quot;he found himself walking between the corroding breasts of the film-actress&quot;, and &quot;these cliff-towers revealed the first spinal landscapes&quot;). At other times the protagonist seems to see the entire world, and life around him, as nothing more than a vast geometrical equation, such as when he observes a woman pacing around the apartment he has rented: &quot;This ... woman was a modulus ... by multiplying her into the space/time of the apartment, he could obtain a valid unit for his own existence.&quot;

<text>Ricardo Alberto Silveira de Carvalho (; born 18 May 1978) is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. He was widely regarded as one of the best centre-backs of his generation.

Carvalho began his career at Porto, where he had loan spells at Leça, Vitória de Setúbal and Alverca, before winning domestic and European trophies under José Mourinho&#x27;s management. In July 2004, Carvalho transferred to Chelsea for a fee of just under €30 million. With the Blues, he won two Premier League titles in a row and one League Cup, in his first two seasons. In 2008, he was voted the team&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year. Two years later, he helped Chelsea win the league and FA Cup, the first Double in the club&#x27;s history. In August 2010, after six years with Chelsea, he transferred to Real Madrid for a fee of £6.7 million, winning two domestic honours under Mourinho&#x27;s management before a free transfer to Monaco in 2013.

In international football, Carvalho&#x27;s national team career began on 11 October 2003 in a friendly match against Albania. He represented Portugal in three UEFA European Championships and two FIFA World Cups, and was a member of the team that won UEFA Euro 2016. He was a regular in Portugal&#x27;s lineup during Euro 2004, when his country advanced all the way to the final before losing to Greece. At the 2006 World Cup, he played in six matches for Portugal, who finished fourth after reaching the semi-finals.

==Club career==

===Porto (1997–2004)===
Ricardo Carvalho was brought to the Porto junior team in the 1996–97 season. In the oncoming season, Carvalho made his professional debut when he signed on loan for Leça. Between 1999 and 2001, he had loan spells at Vitória de Setúbal and Alverca. He returned to Porto in the 2001–02 season, being third choice behind Jorge Costa and Jorge Andrade, but he quickly won a place in the starting XI, forming a terrific partnership with Andrade in the centre of defence, which brought disappointment to captain Jorge Costa who, in April 2002, joined Charlton Athletic on a five-month loan spell. Carvalho made 25 appearances in the Portuguese league that season. In the following season, Jorge Costa returned to Porto and Jorge Andrade moved to Deportivo de La Coruña in Spain. With José Mourinho in charge, Carvalho started the campaign as the third option behind Costa and Pedro Emanuel, but later, his excellent form led him to a place in the first team, appearing in the most important games of the season, including the UEFA cup semi-finals matches against Lazio and the UEFA Cup final where Porto beat Celtic 3–2 in extra time. It was Carvalho&#x27;s first international trophy. By his great season, he was named Portuguese League Footballer of the Year and Porto Footballer of the Year.

It was in the 2003–04 season that Carvalho made his name as a world-class footballer. His solid performances helped the club win the Portuguese league title for the second year in a row, and the most prestigious club trophy in European football, the UEFA Champions League. In this tournament, Carvalho played in all of Porto&#x27;s matches, including the 3–0 win against Monaco in the final. Subsequently, his great performances merited the UEFA Club Best Defender of the Year award, voted into the UEFA Team of the Year, and was named one of the 50 players shortlisted for the 2004 Ballon d&#x27;Or), finishing ninth in the voting, being the only defender in top ten. He was selected for the Portuguese UEFA Euro 2004 squad, in which tournament he was also nominated for the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament. At the end of the season, Carvalho has been tracked by a host of top European clubs, including Internazionale, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Real Madrid offered €8.2 (£7) million for Carvalho, but Porto warned the Spaniards they would not accept anything less than €23.5 (£20) million for the defender after the Spanish team made a much lower offer. Days later, English club Chelsea offered €30 (£25.5) million for the centre back, which the Portuguese team accepted.

===Chelsea (2004–2010)===
At Stamford Bridge, Carvalho, who was considered one of the best centre-backs at Euro 2004, joined his former manager José Mourinho and former teammate Paulo Ferreira on a three-year contract. He signed for a fee of €30 million (£20 million at the time) and performed extremely well in his first season with Chelsea, helping them win the Premier League title, their first top-flight domestic title in 50 years, and the League Cup. He scored his first goal for Chelsea in a 3–1 victory over Norwich City. His partnership with captain John Terry in central defence was hailed as a major factor behind Chelsea&#x27;s two Premier League titles in a row.
The start of 2005–06 season was not as smooth for him, as he was publicly lambasted by Mourinho after making comments about his selection policy. Carvalho said the Chelsea manager&#x27;s decision to drop him for the first game of the season was &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, but Mourinho responded, &quot;Carvalho seems to have problems understanding things, maybe he should have an IQ test,&quot; and then left him out for next game, against Arsenal, and fined him a reported £85,000. He later returned to favour, though, and was a near-regular in the side from September. On 19 October 2005, he scored his first goal of the season in a 4–0 home win against Real Betis in the UEFA Champions League group stage. Carvalho continued his scoring run in Europe by netting his second goal of the season in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 away victory over Anderlecht on 23 November. In January, in a 1–1 Premier League draw against Charlton Athletic, Carvalho received the first red card of his Chelsea career, after he received his second yellow for what the referee judged to be a tackle from behind on Charlton striker Darren Bent. Later, on 29 April 2006, he scored again a goal, his third of the season, in a 3–0 Premier League victory over Manchester United, finishing off a move he had started on the edge of his own penalty area by smashing the ball into the net, to help Chelsea clinch the title for the second consecutive year.

In the 2006–07 season, Carvalho scored again against Manchester United an important goal in a 1–1 draw – a header from a Frank Lampard corner that also bounced off Louis Saha&#x27;s head. On 7 April, he scored another goal against Tottenham Hotspur, firing a low, 30-yard drive past the reach of Spurs goalkeeper Paul Robinson; as a result Chelsea narrowed the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester United to three points. Just 21 days later, on 28 April, Carvalho injured the medial ligaments of his right leg in a Premier League match against Bolton Wanderers. The injury meant Carvalho missed the second leg of the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool. He also missed the FA Cup final against Manchester United, which Chelsea won after a goal from Didier Drogba during extra time. On 18 May 2007, the day of his 29th birthday, Carvalho signed a five-year contract extension with Chelsea, keeping him at the club through the 2011–12 season. For his great performances during the 2006–07 season, Carvalho has been recognized by a number of organisations. Sky Sports listed him as one of seven candidates for the Premiership&#x27;s &quot;Defender of the Year&quot;. He was also one of three Chelsea players nominated for the club&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; honour, which was ultimately won by Michael Essien.
Carvalho continued his excellent form into the 2007–08 season. Following the departure of manager José Mourinho, the Spanish champions, Real Madrid, have once again expressed their interest in Carvalho. A Madrid source said, &quot;We have never been able to get Carvalho because of his connection with Mourinho. Now he has left Chelsea, we feel there&#x27;s a real chance.&quot; But the Portuguese did not leave the English club. On 26 December 2007, in a 4–4 home draw against Aston Villa, on the 79th minute, the home side were outmanoeuvred in the middle of the field leaving only goalkeeper Petr Čech and Carvalho between Villa&#x27;s striker, Gabriel Agbonlahor, and the goal, Carvalho attempted the block, went in two-footed and was red carded for the foul, in the same night, he issued a public apology for his horror tackle on the forward. In that season, Carvalho was one of the most consistent performers at the club and his efforts were rewarded when he scored his first goal of the season in his 150th appearance for the club, a 1–0 Premier League victory over Middlesbrough. Later, on 26 April, Carvalho made his 100th appearance in the Premier League against Manchester United, despite Chelsea&#x27;s 2–1 win, he marred his centenary mark with an error that allowed Wayne Rooney to equalise. His solid performances in the Champions League helped the club reach the final, Chelsea&#x27;s first ever Champions League final appearance and Carvalho&#x27;s second. &quot;The Blues&quot;, however, lost 6–5 on penalties against Manchester United after a 1–1 draw following extra time. Carvalho played in all 120 minutes and he was booked one time for a high challenge on Cristiano Ronaldo right before the end of first half. On 8 May 2008, Carvalho was voted by his fellow Chelsea colleagues as Chelsea&#x27;s &quot;Players Player of the Year&quot;, while finishing in the top three for Chelsea&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award voted by Chelsea fans, along with Michael Ballack and Joe Cole.

Carvalho opened his account for the 2008–09 season against Manchester City in a 1–3 away victory, on 13 September 2008. He was a somewhat peripheral figure for the rest of the season, as injury, the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari, and subsequent appointment of Guus Hiddink meant that he lost his place in the team to Brazilian teammate Alex. He clocked up only 18 appearances in all competitions, two as substitute, scoring one goal.

In July 2009, Carvalho told Chelsea he wanted to quit the club to join Internazionale. He said, &quot;I have had four extraordinary years at Chelsea until this year, which has not been very good - indeed it was the worst of my career.&quot; He played only 18 times in that season at Chelsea. But a move to Inter to link up with Mourinho collapsed when the Italian club wanted to sign him as a free transfer.

The appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, coupled with recovery from injury, saw Carvalho regain his place in the Chelsea team. He made a fine start to the 2009–10 season, scoring a diving header in the 2009 FA Community Shield match against Manchester United, a game in which he also received the Man of the Match award. Chelsea got off to a terrible start conceding inside 10 minutes, but second-half goals from Carvalho and Frank Lampard looked enough to pull the team back from behind to win the trophy, only for Wayne Rooney to clip home an equaliser in stoppage time, forcing penalties. Chelsea went on to win the match 4–1 on penalties, following a 2–2 draw at the end of normal time. On 20 December 2009, Carvalho made his 200th appearance in a 1–1 draw against West Ham United in the Premier League, where the defender was booked just before the half-hour mark for a challenge on Guillermo Franco, before West Ham had their best chance of the opening stages. On 24 March, in a 5–0 win over Portsmouth, Carvalho suffered ankle ligament damage; it seemed serious but it was not necessary a corrective surgery on this injury, leaving the team with just two first-choice central defenders in Alex and captain John Terry, and scaring the Portugal national team head coach, Carlos Queiroz, with the risk of not being able to go to 2010 FIFA World Cup. Due to the injury, Carvalho missed all the following league matches, including the title match victory against Wigan Athletic. It was Carvalho&#x27;s third Premier League title with the Blues. Six days later, on 15 May, he missed another important match, the 2010 FA Cup final, which they won after a single goal from Didier Drogba. By winning the title, Chelsea secured the first ever Double in the club&#x27;s history. At the end of the season, on 24 July, &quot;The Sun&quot; carried reports that Carvalho had expressed his desire to leave Chelsea and link up with former manager José Mourinho, who was now in charge at Real Madrid in Spain.

===Real Madrid (2010–2013)===

On 10 August 2010, Real Madrid signed Carvalho for a reported fee of €7.9 (£6.7) million on a two-year contract. He made his debut on 13 August 2010 in a friendly match against Bayern Munich, which Real Madrid won 4–2 on penalties after a 0–0 draw. His La Liga debut came on 29 August, in a 0–0 draw against Mallorca, and, in the following match, against Osasuna, he scored his first Liga goal; Mesut Özil raced to the penalty area and managed to thread a low cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, whose first time shot was blocked by the Osasuna&#x27;s goalkeeper Ricardo, but the Portuguese managed to tip-toe the rebound for Carvalho to score the go-ahead goal, giving his team a 1–0 home victory. On 19 October 2010, in a UEFA Champions League victory against Milan, Carvalho was named the Man of the match by the Spanish newspaper &quot;Marca&quot;. Some weeks later, on 7 November, Carvalho proved again to be in good shape in a 2–0 derby victory against Atlético Madrid, where he scored his second goal in La Liga, being named again the man of the match. Next month on day 19, in a 1–0 home victory against Sevilla, Carvalho received his first red card for the club; having already been booked in the first half, he was shown a second yellow following an aerial challenge with Sevilla&#x27;s Álvaro Negredo in the second half. On 19 February 2011, he scored his third and last season goal against Levante in another 2–0 league victory. Carvalho made 48 appearances in all competitions that season, bringing calmness and solidness to the defence, and was a heavy reason why Real Madrid had the best defense in Champions League, only letting five goals get past their goalkeeper.

Carvalho started the 2011–12 season well and remained as first-choice centre-back along with Pepe, until a lower back injury kept him sidelined. He returned to action on 18 January in Real Madrid&#x27;s 2–1 home defeat to Barcelona, in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals first leg at the Santiago Bernabéu.

There was significant speculation about his future with Real Madrid in the 2012–13 season, with manager José Mourinho publicly stating on 29 August 2012 that &quot;his services were no longer needed&quot; by the club. However, he opted to stay at the club until the end of his contract.

===Monaco (2013–2016)===

On 28 May 2013, Monaco confirmed on their website that they had secured the services of the Portuguese defender from Real Madrid. He moved to the newly promoted Ligue 1 club on a free transfer when his Real Madrid contract expired on 1 July. Carvalho signed a one-year contract with Monaco, with the option of a second year.

Carvalho was sent off for two yellow cards on 10 August 2014, as Monaco began their season with a 2–1 defeat at home against Lorient. On 14 April 2015, he fouled Álvaro Morata to concede a penalty which was converted by Arturo Vidal as Monaco lost to Juventus in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Champions League. In July 2015, he signed a new one-year deal, keeping him at the club until July 2016.

On 10 August 2016, it was announced that Monaco had not renewed his contract, ending a three-year spell with the Ligue 1 club.

=== Shanghai SIPG (2017–2018) ===
On 9 January 2017, Carvalho was announcing his engagement by André Villas-Boas&#x27;s Shanghai SIPG in the Chinese Super League. He officially joined Shanghai SIPG on 15 February 2017.
On 6 October 2017, Carvalho was handed a seven-month suspended prison sentence in Spain for tax fraud.

==International career==

===Senior team===

During the 2003–04 season, Carvalho earned his first cap for the Portugal national team on 11 October 2003 in a 5–3 friendly match win over Albania. He established himself as a key member of the national team starting XI during the UEFA Euro 2004 championship on home soil, after replacing captain Fernando Couto in the heart of Portugal&#x27;s defence following the team&#x27;s defeat against Greece in the opening group game. In the tournament, he was nominated for the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament along with his compatriots Maniche, Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo. Carvalho formed a strong partnership with Jorge Andrade in the Portuguese defence as his country reached the final, though they lost 1–0 to Greece in a stunning upset. Carvalho started in all of Portugal&#x27;s six games in the tournament, including an epic game against England, where the defender was named Carlsberg Man of the Match, and Portugal emerged victorious 6–5 on penalties. BBC Sport football expert Alan Hansen said that Carvalho was, along with Sol Campbell, the best defender at Euro 2004.

Carvalho represented Portugal at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, finishing fourth overall. During the quarter-final game against England, referee Horacio Elizondo adjudged Wayne Rooney to have trodden on Carvalho&#x27;s groin, right in front of him, and the English player was sent off for violent conduct. The English media, however, speculated that teammate Cristiano Ronaldo had influenced Elizondo&#x27;s decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at the Portuguese bench following Rooney’s dismissal. In the following semi-final game against France in Munich on 5 July 2006, Carvalho was whistled for a foul against France&#x27;s Thierry Henry in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Zinedine Zidane converted the spot kick to give France a 1–0 win over Portugal. Also in the same game, Carvalho was booked with his second yellow card of the knockout phase, and was forced to miss the third place game against hosts Germany on 8 July in Stuttgart, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. He in played each of his team&#x27;s other preceding matches throughout the World Cup, as a member of Portugal&#x27;s central defensive pairing in the team&#x27;s starting lineup alongside Fernando Meira, and as a result of his performances, he was one of the 23 players nominated for the All Star Team of the tournament.

Carvalho was named in the Portuguese squad for Euro 2008. He played in three of Portugal&#x27;s four matches in the tournament, including the 2–0 win against Turkey and the 3–1 victory over Czech Republic in the group stage and the quarter-finals match where Portugal lost 3–2 to Germany. Two years later, Carvalho was named again in the Portuguese squad for the 2010 World Cup. He formed a partnership with Bruno Alves in the centre of defence, playing in all group stage matches without conceding a goal. This time, Portugal reached the round of 16, where they subsequently lost 1–0 against Spain via a David Villa goal.

On 31 August 2011, Carvalho retired from international football after leaving the concentration without talking to his coach and teammates before Portugal&#x27;s match against Cyprus for a Euro 2012 qualifying match, announcing in a statement carried by state news agency Lusa he had been &quot;disrespected&quot;.

On 3 October 2014, after an absence of more than three years, Carvalho was called up by newly appointed Portugal manager Fernando Santos, for the friendly against France and the Euro 2016 qualifying match against Denmark. On 29 March 2015, in a qualifier against Serbia, he headed the opening goal in a 2–1 home victory, his first international goal for over eight years. At 38, he was the oldest outfield player at the Euro 2016 finals in France. He started in all three of his team&#x27;s group stages matches, but was dropped from the starting line-up for the knock-out stages of the competition; Portugal went on to win the tournament, defeating the hosts 1–0 in the final in extra time, although Carvalho remained on the bench.

==Style of play==

Carvalho was always a centre back who stood out in particular for his intelligence, and ability to read the game and time his challenges. He was quick, good in the air and possessed superb technique and good passing ability, which led him to be compared to the legendary Italian defender Franco Baresi. Although he did not possess the physical strength of other defenders, he was known for his tenacity and hard-tackling style of play; in an interview with the Champions League&#x27;s official magazine, Carvalho said of his playing style and physique:
 As such throughout his career, he was often paired with a more physical centre-back, such as his defensive partner at Chelsea, John Terry, whose powerful and aggressive playing style was complemented by Carvalho&#x27;s mobility, technique, intelligence, speed of thought, and ball–playing ability. Despite not being as tall as most centre-backs (1.83 m), Carvalho was also known for his ability to win aerial duels against larger, more physical opponents, as demonstrated by the three headed goals he scored against Manchester United with Rio Ferdinand (1.91 m) and Nemanja Vidić (1.90 m) in defence. In the same UEFA Champions League&#x27;s official magazine interview, he stated:

Carvalho&#x27;s Real Madrid profile described him as &quot;known for his perfect positioning, his foresight and his ability to advance the ball out of the first third&quot;. At his peak, Carvalho was regarded by several pundits and football figures as one of the best defenders in the world, and is considered to be one of the greatest defenders in the history of the Premier League.

==Coaching career==

He was most recently the assistant manager of Andre Villas Boas in French club Marseille.

<doc id="772724" wikidata="Q1639178" url="?curid=772724" title="Opioid use disorder">
<text>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a substance use disorder characterized by cravings for opioids, continued use despite physical and/or psychological deterioration, increased tolerance with use, and withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing opioids. Opioid withdrawal symptoms include nausea, muscle aches, diarrhea, trouble sleeping, agitation, and a low mood. Addiction and dependence are important components of opioid use disorder.

Risk factors include a history of opioid misuse, current opioid misuse, young age, socioeconomic status, race, untreated psychiatric disorders, and environments that promote misuse (social, family, professional, etc.). Complications may include opioid overdose, suicide, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and problems meeting social or professional responsibilities. Diagnosis may be based on criteria by the American Psychiatric Association in the DSM-5.

Opioids include substances such as heroin, morphine, fentanyl, codeine, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. A useful standard for the relative strength of different opioids is morphine milligram equivalents (MME). It is recommended for clinicians to refer to daily MMEs when prescribing opioids to decrease the risk of misuse and adverse effects. Long-term opioid use occurs in about 4% of people following their use for trauma or surgery-related pain. In the United States, most heroin users begin by using prescription opioids that may also be bought illegally.

People with opioid use disorder are often treated with opioid replacement therapy using methadone or buprenorphine. Such treatment reduces the risk of death. Additionally, they may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy, other forms of support from mental health professionals such as individual or group therapy, twelve-step programs, and other peer support programs. The medication naltrexone may also be useful to prevent relapse. Naloxone is useful for treating an opioid overdose and giving those at risk naloxone to take home is beneficial. 

This disorder is much more prevalent than first realized. In 2020, the CDC estimated that nearly 3 million people in the U.S. were living with OUD and more than 65,000 people died by opioid overdose, of whom more than 15,000 overdosed on heroin. In 2022, the U.S. reported 81,806 deaths caused by opioid-related overdoses. Canada reported 32,632 opioid-related deaths between January 2016 and June 2022.

==History==
=== Historical misuse ===
Opiate misuse has been recorded at least since 300 BC. Greek mythology describes Nepenthe (&quot;free from sorrow&quot;) and its use by the hero of the &quot;Odyssey.&quot; Opioids have been used in the Near East for centuries. The purification and isolation of opiates occurred in the early 19th century. In the early 2000s, buprenorphine was one of the first opioid dependence drugs approved in the U.S. to combat opioid abuse, after decades of research led to the development of drugs to fight opioid use disorder.

=== Historical treatment ===
Levacetylmethadol (LAAM) was formerly used to treat opioid dependence. In 2003, its manufacturer discontinued production. There are no available generic versions. LAAM produced long-lasting effects, which allowed the person receiving treatment to visit a clinic only three times per week, as opposed to daily as with methadone. In 2001, LAAM was removed from the European market due to reports of life-threatening ventricular rhythm disorders. In 2003, Roxane Laboratories, Inc. discontinued it in the U.S.

== Diagnosis ==
The DSM-5 guidelines for the diagnosis of opioid use disorder require that the individual has a significant impairment or distress related to opioid uses. To make the diagnosis two or more of 11 criteria must be present in a given year:
# More opioids are taken than intended
# The individual is unable to decrease the number of opioids used
# Large amounts of time are spent trying to obtain opioids, use opioids, or recover from taking them
# The individual has cravings for opioids
# Difficulty fulfilling professional duties at work or school
# Continued use of opioids leading to social and interpersonal consequences
# Decreased social or recreational activities
# Using opioids despite being in physically dangerous settings
# Continued use despite opioids worsening physical or psychological health (i.e. depression, constipation)
# Tolerance
# Withdrawal

The severity can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of criteria present. The tolerance and withdrawal criteria are not considered to be met for individuals taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Addiction and dependence are components of a substance use disorder; addiction is the more severe form.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Opioid intoxication ===
Signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication include:
* Decreased perception of pain
* Euphoria
* Confusion
* Desire to sleep
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Miosis (pupil constriction)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hypokinesis (slowed movement)
* Head nodding
* Slurred speech
* Hypothermia (low body temperature)
=== Opioid overdose ===
Signs and symptoms of opioid overdose include, but are not limited to:
* Pin-point pupils may occur. Patient presenting with dilated pupils may still be experiencing an opioid overdose.
* Decreased heart rate
* Decreased body temperature
* Decreased breathing
* Altered level of consciousness. People may be unresponsive or unconscious.
* Pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs)
* Shock
* Death
===Withdrawal===

Opioid withdrawal can occur with a sudden decrease in, or cessation of, opioids after prolonged use. Onset of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid that was used last. With heroin this typically occurs five hours after use; with methadone, it may take two days. The length of time that major symptoms occur also depends on the opioid used. For heroin withdrawal, symptoms are typically greatest at two to four days and can last up to two weeks. Less significant symptoms may remain for an even longer period, in which case the withdrawal is known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome.
* Agitation
* Anxiety
* Muscle pains
* Increased tearing
* Trouble sleeping
* Runny nose
* Sweating
* Yawning
* Goose bumps
* Dilated pupils
* Diarrhea
* Fast heart rate
* High blood pressure
* Abdominal cramps
* Shakiness
* Cravings
* Sneezing
* Bone pain
* Increased body temperature 
* Hyperalgesia
* Ptosis (drooping eyelids) 
* Teeth chattering 
* Emotional pain
* Stress
* Weakness 
* Malaise
* Alexithymia
* Dysphoria

Treatment of withdrawal may include methadone and buprenorphine. Medications for nausea or diarrhea may also be used.

==Cause==
Opioid use disorder can develop as a result of self-medication. Scoring systems have been derived to assess the likelihood of opiate addiction in chronic pain patients. Healthcare practitioners have long been aware that despite the effective use of opioids for managing pain, empirical evidence supporting long-term opioid use is minimal. Many studies of patients with chronic pain have failed to show any sustained improvement in their pain or ability to function with long-term opioid use.

A 2024 literature review suggests that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are significantly associated with opioid use disorder later in life. ACEs include witnessing violence, experiencing abuse and neglect, and growing up with a family member with a mental health or substance abuse problem.

==Mechanism==
===Addiction===
Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences. Addiction involves the overstimulation of the brain&#x27;s mesocorticolimbic reward circuit (reward system), essential for motivating behaviors linked to survival and reproductive fitness, like seeking food and sex. This reward system encourages associative learning and goal-directed behavior. In addiction, substances overactivate this circuit, causing compulsive behavior due to changes in brain synapses.

In the brain&#x27;s mesolimbic region, Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) accepts releases of dopamine triggered by the neurotransmitters. The brain reward circuitry is rooted in these networks, interacting between the mesolimbic and prefrontal cortex; these systems link motivation, anti-stress, incentive salience, and wellbeing.

The incentive-sensitization theory differentiates between &quot;wanting&quot; (driven by dopamine in the reward circuit) and &quot;liking&quot; (related to brain pleasure centers). This explains the addictive potential of non-pleasurable substances and the persistence of opioid addiction despite tolerance to their euphoric effects. Addiction surpasses mere avoidance of withdrawal, involving cues and stress that reactivate reward-driven behaviors. This is thought to be an important reason detoxification alone is unsuccessful 90% of the time.

Overexpression of the gene transcription factor ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens plays a crucial role in the development of an addiction to opioids and other addictive drugs by sensitizing drug reward and amplifying compulsive drug-seeking behavior. Like other addictive drugs, overuse of opioids leads to increased ΔFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens. Opioids affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens via the disinhibition of dopaminergic pathways as a result of inhibiting the GABA-based projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which negatively modulate dopamine neurotransmission. In other words, opioids inhibit the projections from the RMTg to the VTA, which in turn disinhibits the dopaminergic pathways that project from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens and elsewhere in the brain.

The differences in the genetic regions encoding the dopamine receptors for each individual may help to elucidate part of the risk for opioid addiction and general substance abuse. Studies of the D2 Dopamine Receptor, in particular, have shown some promising results. One specific SNP is at the TaqI RFLP (rs1800497). In a study of 530 Han Chinese heroin-addicted individuals from a Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program, those with the specific genetic variation showed higher mean heroin consumption by around double those without the SNP. This study helps to show the contribution of dopamine receptors to substance addiction and more specifically to opioid abuse.

Neuroimaging has shown functional and structural alterations in the brain. Chronic intake of opioids such as heroin may cause long-term effects in the orbitofrontal area (OFC), which is essential for regulating reward-related behaviors, emotional responses, and anxiety. Moreover, neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies demonstrate dysregulation of circuits associated with emotion, stress and high impulsivity.

===Dependence===
Opioid dependence can occur as physical dependence, psychological dependence, or both. Drug dependence is an adaptive state associated with a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of repeated exposure to a stimulus (e.g., drug intake). Dependence is a component of a substance use disorder. Opioid dependence can manifest as physical dependence, psychological dependence, or both.

Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been shown to mediate opioid-induced withdrawal symptoms via downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2), protein kinase B (AKT), and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). As a result of downregulated signaling through these proteins, opiates cause VTA neuronal hyperexcitability and shrinkage (specifically, the size of the neuronal soma is reduced). It has been shown that when an opiate-naive person begins using opiates in concentrations that induce euphoria, BDNF signaling increases in the VTA.

Upregulation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal transduction pathway by cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a gene transcription factor, in the nucleus accumbens is a common mechanism of psychological dependence among several classes of drugs of abuse. Upregulation of the same pathway in the locus coeruleus is also a mechanism responsible for certain aspects of opioid-induced physical dependence.

A scale was developed to compare the harm and dependence liability of 20 drugs. The scale uses a rating of zero to three to rate physical dependence, psychological dependence, and pleasure to create a mean score for dependence. Selected results can be seen in the chart below. Heroin and morphine both scored highest, at 3.0.
===Opioid receptors===
A genetic basis for the efficacy of opioids in the treatment of pain has been demonstrated for several specific variations, but the evidence for clinical differences in opioid effects is not clear. There is an estimated 50% genetic contribution to opioid use disorder. The pharmacogenomics of the opioid receptors and their endogenous ligands have been the subject of intensive activity in association studies. These studies test broadly for a number of phenotypes, including opioid dependence, cocaine dependence, alcohol dependence, methamphetamine dependence/psychosis, response to naltrexone treatment, personality traits, and others. Major and minor variants have been reported for every receptor and ligand coding gene in both coding sequences, as well as regulatory regions. Research on endogenous opioid receptors has focused around &quot;OPRM1&quot; gene, which encodes the μ-opioid receptor, and the &quot;OPRK1&quot; and &quot;OPRD1&quot; genes, which encode the κ and δ receptors, respectively. Newer approaches shift away from analysis of specific genes and regions, and are based on an unbiased screen of genes across the entire genome, which have no apparent relationship to the phenotype in question. These GWAS studies yield a number of implicated genes, although many of them code for seemingly unrelated proteins in processes such as cell adhesion, transcriptional regulation, cell structure determination, and RNA, DNA, and protein handling/modifying.

====118A&gt;G variant====
While over 100 variants have been identified for the opioid mu-receptor, the most studied mu-receptor variant is the non-synonymous 118A&gt;G variant, which results in functional changes to the receptor, including lower binding site availability, reduced mRNA levels, altered signal transduction, and increased affinity for beta-endorphin. In theory, all these functional changes would reduce the impact of exogenous opioids, requiring a higher dose to achieve the same therapeutic effect. This points to a potential for greater addictive capacity in individuals who require higher dosages to achieve pain control. But evidence linking the 118A&gt;G variant to opioid dependence is mixed, with associations shown in a number of study groups, but negative results in other groups. One explanation for the mixed results is the possibility of other variants that are in linkage disequilibrium with the 118A&gt;G variant and thus contribute to different haplotype patterns more specifically associated with opioid dependence.

====Non-opioid receptor genes====
While opioid receptors have been the most widely studied, a number of other genes have been implicated in OUD. Higher numbers of (CA) repeats flanking the preproenkephalin gene, PENK, have been associated with opiate dependence. There have been mixed results for the MCR2 gene, encoding melanocortin receptor type 2, implicating both protection and risk to heroin addiction. A number of enzymes in the cytochrome P450 family may also play a role in dependence and overdose due to variance in breakdown of opioids and their receptors. There are also multiple potential complications with combining opioids with antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs (both common drugs for chronic pain patients) because of their effects on inducing CYP enzymes. Genotyping of CYP2D6 in particular may play a role in helping patients with individualized treatment for OUD and other drug addictions.

== Prevention ==
The CDC gives prescribers specific recommendations for starting opioids, clinically appropriate use, and assessing risks associated with opioid therapy. Improving opioid prescribing guidelines and practices can help reduce unnecessary exposure to opioids, which in turn lowers the risk of developing OUD (opioid use disorder). Healthcare providers should strictly follow evidence-based guidelines, such as the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain, to ensure safe and appropriate use. Another way to prevent OUD is educating the public about the risks of prescription opioids and illegal substances like fentanyl. Awareness campaigns, community outreach programs, and school-based education initiatives can help people make informed decisions about opioid use and recognize the signs of addiction early on. 

Large U.S. retail pharmacy chains are implementing protocols, guidelines, and initiatives to take back unused opioids, providing naloxone kits, and being vigilant about suspicious prescriptions. Insurance programs can help limit opioid use by setting quantity limits on prescriptions or requiring prior authorizations for certain medications. Many U.S. officials and government leaders have become involved in implementing preventative measures to decrease opioid usage in the United States. Targeted education of medical providers and government officials can lead to provisions affecting opioid distribution by healthcare providers.

A 2024 literature review found a strong association between ACEs and opioid abuse later in life, suggesting that a high ACE score should be considered a risk factor for opioid abuse. Screening ACEs before prescribing or implementing interventions involving opioids can mitigate the potential for misuse.

=== Opioid overdose ===
Naloxone is used for the emergency treatment of an overdose. It can be given by many routes (e.g., intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), subcutaneous, intranasal, and inhalation) and acts quickly by displacing opioids from opioid receptors and preventing the activation of these receptors. Naloxone kits are recommended for laypersons who may witness an opioid overdose, for people with large prescriptions for opioids, those in substance use treatment programs, and those recently released from incarceration. Since this is a life-saving medication, many areas of the U.S. have implemented standing orders for law enforcement to carry and give naloxone as needed. In addition, naloxone can be used to challenge a person&#x27;s opioid abstinence status before starting a medication such as naltrexone, which is used in the management of opioid addiction.

Good Samaritan laws typically protect bystanders who administer naloxone. In the U.S., at least 40 states have Good Samaritan laws to encourage bystanders to take action without fear of prosecution. As of 2019, 48 states give pharmacists the authority to distribute naloxone without an individual prescription.

Homicide, suicide, accidents and liver disease are also opioid-related causes of death for those with OUD. Many of these causes of death are unnoticed due to the often limited information on death certificates. Other risk factors for overdose mortality related to opioids at the individual level include clinical factors such as cardiovascular disease, comorbid mental disorders and psychological stress (e.g., depression), a history of substance use disorders, economic and community distress (e.g., low education, high unemployment), and characteristics such as male sex and middle age.

== Mitigation ==
The &quot;CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain-United States, 2022&quot; provides recommendations related to opioid misuse, OUD, and opioid overdoses. It reports a lack of clinical evidence that &quot;abuse-deterrent&quot; opioids (e.g., OxyContin), as labeled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, are effective for OUD risk mitigation. CDC guidance suggests the prescription of immediate-release opioids instead of opioids that have a long duration (long-acting) or opioids that are released over time (extended release). Other recommendations include prescribing the lowest opioid dose that successfully addresses the pain in opioid-naïve patients and collaborating with patients who already take opioid therapy to maximize the effect of non-opioid analgesics.

While receiving opioid therapy, patients should be periodically evaluated for opioid-related complications and clinicians should review state prescription drug monitoring program systems. The latter should be assessed to reduce the risk of overdoses in patients due to their opioid dose or medication combinations. For patients receiving opioid therapy in whom the risks outweigh the benefits, clinicians and patients should develop a treatment plan to decrease their opioid dose incrementally.

Compartmental models are mathematical frameworks used to assess and describe complex topics such as the opioid crisis. Applied compartmental models are used in public health to assess the effectiveness of interventions in opioid use disorder. Most overdoses in 2020 were due to synthetic opioids, highlighting a need to incorporate synthetic opioid data in the models.

For more specific mitigation strategies regarding opioid overdoses, see .

==Management==
Opioid use disorders typically require long-term treatment and care with the goal of reducing the person&#x27;s risks and improving their long-term physical and psychological condition.

First-line management involves the use of opioid replacement therapies, particularly methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone. Withdrawal management alone is strongly discouraged, because of its association with elevated risks of HIV and hepatitis C transmission, high rates of overdose deaths, and nearly universal relapse. This approach is seen as ineffective without plans for transition to long-term evidence-based addiction treatment, such as opioid agonist treatment. Though treatment reduces mortality rates, the first four weeks after treatment begins and the four weeks after treatment ceases are the riskiest times for drug-related deaths. These periods of increased vulnerability are significant because many of those in treatment leave programs during these periods. There is evidence that people with opioid use disorder who are dependent on pharmaceutical opioids may require a different management approach from those who take heroin.

===Medication===
Opioid replacement therapy (ORT), also known as opioid substitution therapy (OST) or Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD), involves replacing an opioid, such as heroin. Commonly used drugs for ORT are methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone), which are taken under medical supervision. Buprenorphine/naloxone is usually preferred over methadone because of its safety profile, which is considered significantly better, primarily with regard to its risk of overdose and effects on the heart (QTc prolongation).

Buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, and naltrexone are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medication-assisted treatment (MAT). In the U.S., the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certifies opioid treatment programs (OTPs), where methadone can be dispensed at methadone clinics. As of 2023, the Waiver Elimination (MAT Act), also known as the &quot;Omnibus Bill&quot;, removed the federal requirement for medical providers to obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, in an attempt to increase access to OUD treatment.

The driving principle behind ORT is the patient&#x27;s reclamation of a self-directed life. ORT facilitates this process by reducing symptoms of drug withdrawal and drug cravings. In some countries (not the U.S. or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (People with HIV/AIDS or hepatitis C are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40–65% of patients maintain abstinence from additional opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy and 70–95% can reduce their use significantly. Medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illegal opioids are concurrently eliminated or reduced. Clonidine or lofexidine can help treat the symptoms of withdrawal.

The period when initiating methadone and the time immediately after discontinuing treatment with both drugs are periods of particularly increased mortality risk, which should be dealt with by both public health and clinical strategies. ORT has proved to be the most effective treatment for improving the health and living condition of people experiencing illegal opiate use or dependence, including mortality reduction and overall societal costs, such as the economic loss from drug-related crime and healthcare expenditure. A review of UK hospital policies found that local guidelines delayed access to substitute opioids, for instance by requiring lab tests to demonstrate recent use or input from specialist drug teams before prescribing. Delays to access can increase people&#x27;s risk of discharging themselves early against medical advice. ORT is endorsed by the World Health Organization, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and UNAIDS as effective at reducing injection, lowering risk for HIV/AIDS, and promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy.

Buprenorphine and methadone work by reducing opioid cravings, easing withdrawal symptoms, and blocking the euphoric effects of opioids via cross-tolerance, and in the case of buprenorphine, a high-affinity partial opioid agonist, also due to opioid receptor saturation.

====Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone====

Buprenorphine can be administered either as a standalone product or in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone. This inclusion is strategic: it deters misuse by preventing the crushing and injecting of the medication, encouraging instead the prescribed sublingual (under the tongue) route. Buprenorphine/naloxone formulations are available as tablets and films; these formulations operate efficiently when taken sublingually. In this form, buprenorphine&#x27;s bioavailability remains robust (35–55%), while naloxone&#x27;s is significantly reduced (~10%).

Buprenorphine&#x27;s role as a partial opioid receptor agonist sets it apart from full agonists like methadone. Its unique pharmacological profile makes it less likely to cause respiratory depression, thanks to its &quot;ceiling effect&quot;. While the risk of misuse or overdose is higher with buprenorphine alone compared to the buprenorphine/naloxone combination or methadone, its usage is linked to a decrease in mortality. Approved in the U.S. for opioid dependence treatment in 2002, buprenorphine has since expanded in form, with the FDA approving a month-long injectable version in 2017.

When initiating buprenorphine/naloxone therapy, several critical factors must be considered. These include the severity of withdrawal symptoms, the time elapsed since the last opioid use, and the type of opioid involved (long-acting vs. short-acting). A standard induction method involves waiting until the patient exhibits moderate withdrawal symptoms, as measured by a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, achieving a score of around 12. Alternatively, &quot;microdosing&quot; commences with a small dose immediately, regardless of withdrawal symptoms, offering a more flexible approach to treatment initiation. &quot;Macrodosing&quot; starts with a larger dose of Suboxone, a different induction strategy with its own set of considerations.

====Methadone====
Methadone is a commonly used full-opioid agonist in the treatment of opioid use disorder. It is effective in relieving withdrawal symptoms and cravings in people with opioid addiction, and can also be used in pain control in certain situations. While methadone is a widely prescribed form of OAT, it often requires more frequent clinical visits compared to buprenorphine/naloxone, which also has a better safety profile and lower risk of respiratory depression and overdose.

Important considerations when initiating methadone include the patient&#x27;s opioid tolerance, the time since last opioid use, the type of opioid used (long-acting vs. short-acting), and the risk of methadone toxicity. Methadone comes in different forms: tablet, oral solution, or an injection.

One of methadone&#x27;s benefits is that it can last up to 56 hours in the body, so if a patient misses a daily dose, they will not typically struggle with withdrawal symptoms. Other advantages of methadone include reduction in infectious disease related to injection drug use, and reduced mortality. Methadone has a number of potential side effects, including slowed breathing, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and headache.

====Naltrexone====
Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of opioid addiction. It is not as widely used as buprenorphine or methadone for OUD due to low rates of patient acceptance, non-adherence due to daily dosing, and difficulty achieving abstinence from opioids before beginning treatment. Additionally, dosing naltrexone after recent opioid use can lead to precipitated withdrawal. Conversely, naltrexone antagonism at the opioid receptor can be overcome with higher doses of opioids. Naltrexone monthly IM injections received FDA approval in 2010 for the treatment of opioid dependence in abstinent opioid users.

====Other opioids====
Evidence of effects of heroin maintenance compared to methadone are unclear as of 2010. A Cochrane review found some evidence in opioid users who had not improved with other treatments. In Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, long-term injecting drug users who do not benefit from methadone and other medication options may be treated with injectable heroin that is administered under the supervision of medical staff. Other countries where it is available include Spain, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, and Luxembourg. Dihydrocodeine in both extended-release and immediate-release form is also sometimes used for maintenance treatment as an alternative to methadone or buprenorphine in some European countries. Dihydrocodeine is an opioid agonist. It may be used as a second-line treatment. A 2020 systematic review found low-quality evidence that dihydrocodeine may be no more effective than other routinely used medication interventions in reducing illicit opiate use.An extended-release morphine confers a possible reduction of opioid use and with fewer depressive symptoms but overall more adverse effects compared to other forms of long-acting opioids. Retention in treatment was not found to be significantly different. It is used in Switzerland and more recently in Canada.

====In pregnancy====

Pregnant women with opioid use disorder can also receive treatment with methadone, naltrexone, or buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be associated with more favorable outcomes compared to methadone for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy. Studies show that buprenorphine is linked to lower risks of preterm birth, greater birth weight, and larger head circumference without increased harm. Compared to methadone, it consistently results in improved birth weight and gestational age, though these findings should be interpreted with caution due to potential biases. Buprenorphine use also correlates with a lower risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, with similar risks of adverse maternal outcomes as methadone. Infants born to buprenorphine-treated mothers generally have higher birth weights, fewer withdrawal symptoms, and a lower likelihood of premature birth. Additionally, these infants often require less treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome and have mothers who are more likely to start treatment earlier in pregnancy, leading to longer gestations and larger infants.

===Behavioral therapy===
Paralleling the variety of medical treatments, there are many forms of psychotherapy and community support for treating OUD. The primary evidence-based psychotherapies include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), contingency management (CM), and twelve-step programs. Community-based support such as support groups (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous) and therapeutic housing for those with OUD is also an important aspect of healing.

====Cognitive behavioral therapy====
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychosocial intervention that systematically evaluates thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about a problem and works to develop coping strategies to work through those problems. This intervention has demonstrated success in many psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression) and substance use disorders (e.g., tobacco). But the use of CBT alone for OUD has declined due to lack of efficacy, and many rely on medication therapy or medication therapy with CBT, since both were found to be more efficacious than CBT alone. CBT has been shown to be more successful in relapse prevention than treatment of ongoing drug use. It is particularly known for its durability.

==== Motivational Enhancement Therapy ====
Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) is the manualized form of motivational interviewing (MI). MI leverages one&#x27;s intrinsic motivation to recover through education, formulation of relapse prevention strategies, reward for adherence to treatment guidelines, and positive thinking to keep motivation high—which are based on a person&#x27;s socioeconomic status, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and readiness to recover. Like CBT, MET alone has not shown convincing efficacy for OUD. There is stronger support for combining it with other therapies.

==== Contingency Management Therapy ====
Contingency Management Therapy (CMT) employs similar principles as operant behavioral conditioning, such as using incentives to reach certain goals (e.g., verified abstinence, usually in the form of urine drug testing). This form of psychotherapy has the strongest, most robust empirical support for treating drug addiction. Outpatient clients are shown to have improved medication compliance, retention, and abstinence when using voucher-based incentives. One way this is implemented is to offer take-home privileges for methadone programs. Despite its effectiveness during treatment, effects tend to wane once terminated. Additionally, the cost barrier limits its application in the clinical community.

====Twelve-step programs====

While medical treatment may help with the initial symptoms of opioid withdrawal, once the first stages of withdrawal are through, a method for long-term preventative care is attendance at 12-step groups such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA). NA&#x27;s 12-step process is based on the 12-step facilitation of Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and centers on peer support, self-help, and spiritual connectedness. Some evidence also supports the use of these programs for adolescents. Multiple studies have shown increased abstinence for those in NA compared to those who are not. Members report a median abstinence length of 5 years.

=== Novel experimental treatments ===
Though medications and behavioral treatments are effective forms for treating OUD, relapse remains a common problem. The medical community has looked to novel technologies and traditional alternative medicines for new ways to approach the issues of continued cravings and impaired executive functioning. While consensus on their efficacy has not been reached, a number of reviews have shown promising results for the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for reducing cravings in OUD. These results are consistent with the use of NIBS for reducing cravings of other substances. Additionally, investigations into the anecdotal evidence of psychedelics like ibogaine have also shown the possibility of decreased cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Ibogaine is illegal in the U.S. but is unregulated in Mexico, Costa Rica, and New Zealand, where many clinics use it for addiction treatment. Research has shown a minor mortality risk due to its cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects.

In 2024 the FDA approved the NET (NeuroElectric Therapy) device, which reduces withdrawal symptoms by neurostimulation. Used for three to five days of continuous treatment, NET delivers alternating current via surface electrodes placed trans-cranially at the base of the skull on each side of the head.

== Treatment challenges ==
The stigma surrounding addiction can heavily influence opioid addicts not to seek help. Many people view addiction as a moral failing rather than a medical condition, which can lead to feelings of shame and isolation. This stigma can also affect family members, making it difficult for them to support their loved ones effectively.

According to position papers on the treatment of opioid dependence published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the World Health Organization, care providers should not treat opioid use disorder as the result of a weak moral character or will but as a medical condition. Some evidence suggests the possibility that opioid use disorders occur due to genetic or other chemical mechanisms that may be difficult to identify or change, such as dysregulation of brain circuitry involving reward and volition. But the exact mechanisms involved are unclear, leading to debate over the influence of biology and free will.

Accessing appropriate treatment is often a significant barrier. Factors include:

* Availability of services: Many areas, especially rural regions, lack treatment facilities or qualified healthcare providers who specialize in opioid use disorder.
* Insurance coverage: People without insurance or those whose plans do not cover substance use disorder treatment may struggle to find affordable care.
* Transportation: For many, getting to treatment facilities can be challenging due to a lack of transportation options.
* Public stigma: Many communities may advocate against establishing treatment programs in their area due to stigma and perceptions of people with substance use disorders.
The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) passed in 2016, with the aim to remove treatment barriers by allocating federal funds to increase accessibility to Medication Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment in rural areas. Telehealth could be a beneficial treatment alternative, especially for people in rural areas with limited access to MOUD treatment.

The variety of treatment modalities available for OUD—such as medication-assisted treatment (MAT), counseling, and residential programs—can be overwhelming. Patients may have difficulty understanding which option best suits them, leading to confusion and potential disengagement from the treatment process. Withdrawal symptoms can be severe and uncomfortable, leading many people to relapse before they complete detoxification or engage fully in recovery programs. The fear of withdrawal often prevents people from seeking help altogether.

== Epidemiology ==
Globally, the number of people with opioid dependence increased from 10.4 million in 1990 to 15.5 million in 2010. In 2016, the numbers rose to 27 million people who experienced this disorder. Opioid use disorders resulted in 122,000 deaths worldwide in 2015, up from 18,000 deaths in 1990. Deaths from all causes rose from 47.5 million in 1990 to 55.8 million in 2013.

===United States===

The current epidemic of opioid abuse is the most lethal drug epidemic in U.S. history. The crisis can be distinguished by waves of opioid overdose deaths as described by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. The first wave began in the 1990s, related to the rise in prescriptions of natural opioids (such as codeine and morphine), semisynthetic opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone), and synthetic opioids like methadone. In the U.S., &quot;the age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate involving opioid analgesics increased from 1.4 to 5.4 deaths per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2010. The second wave dates to around 2010 with the rapid increase in opioid overdoses due to heroin. By this time, there were already four times as many deaths by overdose than in 1999. The age-adjusted drug poisoning death rate involving heroin doubled from 0.7 to 1.4 deaths per 100,000 people between 1999 and 2011 and then continued to increase to 4.1 in 2015. The third wave of overdose deaths began in 2013, related to synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly produced fentanyl. While the illicit fentanyl market has continuously changed, the drug is generally sold as an adulterant in heroin. Research suggests that the rapid increase of fentanyl into the illicit opioid market has been largely supply-side-driven and dates to 2006. Decreasing heroin purity, competition from increased access to prescription medications, and dissemination of &quot;The Siegfried Method&quot; (a relatively simple and cost-effective method of fentanyl production) were major factors in street suppliers&#x27; inclusion of fentanyl in their products. The current, fourth wave, which began in 2016, has been characterized by polysubstance overdose due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl mixed with stimulants such as methamphetamine or cocaine. In 2010, around 0.5% of opioid-related deaths were attributed to mixture with stimulants. This figure increased more than 50-fold by 2021, when about a third of opioid-related deaths, or 34,000, involved stimulant use.

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a public health emergency due to an increase in the misuse of opioids. The administration introduced a strategic framework called the Five-Point Opioid Strategy, which includes providing access recovery services, increasing the availability of reversing agents for overdose, funding opioid misuse and pain research, changing treatments of people managing pain, and updating public health reports related to combating opioid drug misuse.

Studies done in the U.S. from 2010 to 2019 revealed that about 86.6% of people in the U.S. who could have benefited from opioid use disorder treatment were not receiving it. Over the past decade, the uptake of medications for opioid use disorder has increased, but there are still many regions with a prevalence of opioid use disorder and lack of medical support.

The U.S. epidemic in the 2000s is related to a number of factors. Rates of opioid use and dependency vary by age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. With respect to race, the discrepancy in deaths is thought to be due to an interplay between physician prescribing and lack of access to healthcare and certain prescription drugs. Men are at higher risk for opioid use and dependency than women, and men also account for more opioid overdoses than women, although this gap is closing. Women are more likely to be prescribed pain relievers, be given higher doses, use them for longer durations, and become dependent upon them faster.

Deaths due to opioid use also tend to skew at older ages than deaths from use of other illicit drugs. This does not reflect opioid use as a whole, which includes younger people. Overdoses from opioids are highest among people between the ages of 40 and 50, in contrast to heroin overdoses, which are highest among people between the ages of 20 and 30. 21- to 35-year-olds represent 77% of people who enter treatment for opioid use disorder, but the average age of first-time use of prescription painkillers was 21.2 years in 2013. Among the middle class, means of acquiring funds include elder financial abuse and international dealers noticing a lack of enforcement in their transaction scams throughout the Caribbean.

Since 2018, with the federal government&#x27;s passing of the SUPPORT (Substance Use-Disorder Prevention That Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act) Act, federal restrictions on methadone use for patients receiving Medicare have been lifted. Since March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, buprenorphine may be dispensed via telemedicine in the U.S.

In October 2021, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation to combat the opioid crisis. This included establishing a program for the use of medication-assisted substance use disorder treatment for incarcerated individuals in state and local correctional facilities, decriminalizing the possession and sale of hypodermic needles and syringes, establishing an online directory for distributors of opioid antagonists, and expanding the number of eligible crimes committed by individuals with a substance use disorder that may be considered for diversion to a substance use treatment program. Until these laws were signed, incarcerated New Yorkers did not reliably have access to medication-assisted treatment and syringe possession was still a class A misdemeanor despite New York authorizing and funding syringe exchange and access programs. This legislation acknowledges the ways New York State laws have contributed to opioid deaths: in 2020 more than 5112 people died from overdoses in New York State, with 2192 deaths in New York City.

As of 2023, the Waiver Elimination (MAT Act), as part of Section 1262 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (or &quot;Omnibus Bill&quot;), removed the federal requirement for medical providers to obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, in an attempt to increase access to OUD treatment. Before this bill, practitioners were required to receive a Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA) waiver, also known as &quot;x-waiver&quot;, before prescribing buprenorphine. There is also now no longer any limit to the number of patients to whom a provider may prescribe buprenorphine for OUD.

== Canada ==
Canada recorded 32,632 opioid-related deaths between January 2016 and June 2022. The marked increase in opioid toxicity deaths is largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Effects of COVID-19 on opioid overdose and telehealth treatment ===
Epidemiological research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the opioid crisis. The overarching trend of opioid overdose data has shown a plateau in deaths around 2017–18, with a sudden and acute rise in 2019 primarily attributed to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. In 2020, there were 93,400 drug overdoses in the U.S. with &gt;73% (approximately 69,000) due to opioid overdose. One &quot;JAMA&quot; review by Gomes et al. showed that estimated years of life loss (YLL) due to opioid toxicity in the U.S. increased by 276%. This increase was particularly felt by those ages 15 to 19, whose YLL increased nearly threefold. Younger male adults had the largest effect size. Other reviews of U.S. and Canadian opioid data coinciding with the onset of COVID-19 suggested significant increases in opioid-related emergency medicine utilization, increased positivity for opioids, and surprisingly no to decreased change in naloxone dispensation.

Telehealth played a large role in OUD treatment access, and legislation on telehealth continues to evolve. A study of Medicare beneficiaries with new-onset OUD showed that those who received telehealth services had a 33% lower risk of death by overdose. Minority groups such as Black and Hispanic Americans have also been shown to benefit from the increased access due to telehealth programs introduced during the pandemic, despite increasing disparity gaps in other OUD-related outcomes. The DEA and HHS have extended telemedicine flexibility in regard to prescribing controlled substances such as buprenorphine for OUD through 31 December 2024.

<doc id="772725" wikidata="Q262757" url="?curid=772725" title="The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)">
<text>The Seven Cities of Gold is a strategy video game created by Danielle Bunten Berry (credited as Dan Bunten) and Ozark Softscape and published by Electronic Arts in 1984. The player takes the role of a late 15th-century explorer for the Spanish Empire, setting sail to the New World in order to explore the map and interact with the natives in order to win gold and please the Spanish court. The name derives from the &quot;seven cities&quot; of Quivira and Cíbola that were said to be located somewhere in the Southwest United States. It is considered to be one of the earliest open world video games.

==Gameplay==
The game begins with the player having been given an exploration fleet by the Spanish crown, consisting of four ships, one hundred men, and some trade goods. The game appears showing a city in Spain, a fairly simplified 2D side-scrolling representation of the town consisting of the player&#x27;s home, a palace, a pub and an outfitters. The player can walk about the town with the joystick, walking into the buildings in order to interact with them via menus. For instance, walking into the outfitters will bring up a menu allowing the user to buy supplies, men and trade goods. Interaction in Spain is fairly limited; the player soon moves to the ships, at one end of the city map, to leave port.

Most of the game is played on a game screen with a small scrolling top-down map in the center and a number of status displays surrounding it. After leaving port the display switches to this map, and the player guides the ship to the New World. At any point the player can bring up a menu with contents based on the player&#x27;s current location. For instance, if the menu is brought up while on the ship, the items allow you to view the map, or &quot;drop stuff off&quot;, the later selection allowing exploration parties to be created by dropping off men and supplies from the ships. When the player is on land as part of an exploration party, the same menu item creates a fort when men are dropped off in it.
Upon arriving in the new world, the player can explore the coastline, set up missionaries and forts, and interact with the native peoples. Approaching the villages results in the map zooming in to show the village, represented by four buildings, and the natives moving about. In the center is the village chieftain, approaching him and opening the menu allows trade for gold and food. The player has the option to peacefully trade with or conquer the natives, and can (with the right choices and luck) sometimes convert them, turning the village into a mission.

The natives can be attacked simply by moving onto them. A few accidental killings is acceptable to the village, and sometimes unavoidable, but too many and the natives will become hostile and attack the party. In many cases, the Spanish can overwhelm the natives, who will eventually give up fighting and allow the Spanish to plunder the town. Ambushes are also common, between the towns.

Much of &quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; was influenced by historical accounts of the era. Interactions with the natives could be peaceful or hostile, or become hostile due to the language barrier. While it could be assumed that the goal of the game is to return with riches from the New World, there really are no goals at all. The game has no scoring system and provides the player with feedback from the King, but no interference, if they slaughter the natives. According to Bunten, from an interview in &quot;Antic&quot;:

The size of the New World was one of the concepts that was integrated into the design; the land had to be detailed and diverse. As a result, data storage and retrieval became a major issue, particularly as the developers did not want lengthy load times to interfere with the game. As described by Bunten: &quot;Our only way out was to use technologies we didn&#x27;t have until we were forced to invent them&quot;. The game used a streaming system to allow the map to be loaded in without interrupting game play. The game ships with a single &quot;world&quot; closely modeled on the real one, including details as small as the Florida Keys and most well-known rivers. The game also includes a world creating engine that allows the user to build a truly new New World, saving it to a user supplied disk.

Game maps include one or more &quot;lost cities&quot; that are hidden by a mountain icon in locations that are typically far from other land masses. Explorers that stumble on one of these hidden cities will be greeted with the message &quot;Sir, we have discovered a lost city&quot;. Inhabitants of this type of village are docile and run from the player and when the chief of the village is approached, the game will inform the player that &quot;We may take what we want as tribute!&quot; and the user will be able to acquire a sizable amount of gold without having to trade.

== Ports ==
Bunten considered the version for the Atari 8-bit computers to be the only &quot;full&quot; version, while the others were ports of which Bunten said &quot;we did the best we could with what we had&quot;. Versions for the Commodore 64 and Apple II were released soon after in the same year, followed by the Mac and Amiga in 1985 and IBM PC compatibles in 1987.

== Reception ==
In 1984, &quot;COMPUTE!&quot;″s James V. Trunzo called &quot;Seven Cities&quot; &quot;a riveting new adventure game ... a graphically enhanced strategy game that challenges and educates as well as entertain&quot;, and noted its ability to generate new maps. In 1985 &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;″s Gregg Keizer wrote that &quot;this exceptional game&quot; let him fulfill his childhood fantasy of exploring the Amazon: &quot;Fantasies and worlds to explore. What more could you want?&quot;

&quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; had sold over 100,000 copies by the time it won the &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;&#x27;s 1985 reader poll. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked &quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; as the 61st best game of all time, stating that &quot;Ozark Softscape&#x27;s fantastic game of New World exploration offended some with its accurate treatment of autochthonous tribes&quot;.

===Reviews===
* &quot;The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine&quot; #2 (Feb./March, 1986)
* &quot;Casus Belli&quot; #24 (Feb 1985)

== Legacy ==
In 1993, a new version was released for the IBM PC. It is more a reconceptualization of the gameplay than a simple cosmetic makeover. The game is set up as a tier of goals that must be accomplished. For example, the first goal is to establish one mission, one colony, and three forts in the space of ten voyages. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 stated that the changes in the VGA remake of the game were improvements. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; is still the fresh, simple, playable game that broke ground in the early days of computer gaming&quot;.

&quot;Seven Cities of Gold, Commemorative Edition&quot; won the 1993 Origins Award for &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game&quot;.

Glickman&#x27;s first foray into public office was as a publicly elected member of the Wichita School Board, which oversees the Wichita Public Schools (USD-259), one of the nation&#x27;s largest school districts. Between 1973 and 1976 he served as President of the Wichita School Board.

===U. S. House of Representatives===
Glickman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Kansas&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 1976, serving from January 3, 1977 to January 3, 1995, through eight successive re-elections.

====Election====
In 1976, in his first congressional race, Glickman was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat from , defeating eight-term Republican incumbent Garner Shriver. Glickman held the office for nine consecutive terms.

====Issues and committees====
Glickman was active in general aviation policy, and co-wrote the General Aviation Revitalization Act (GARA) – controversial landmark legislation providing product liability protection for small airplane manufacturers (his district has produced most of America&#x27;s light aircraft).

During his congressional tenure, Glickman was also active in agriculture issues (his district&#x27;s other major industry), and served on the House Agriculture Committee, including six years as chair of the subcommittee overseeing federal farm policy. He served as principal author of the 1990 Farm Bill and other legislation. While there, he lobbied for the position of Secretary of Agriculture under President Bill Clinton, losing initially, but winning the post after his tenth-race election ouster from Congress.

In 1986, Glickman was one of the House impeachment managers appointed by the House of Representatives in 1986 to prosecute the case in the impeachment trial of Harry E. Claiborne, judge of the United States District Court for Nevada. Claiborne was found guilty by the United States Senate and removed from his federal judgeship.

In 1993, he was appointed chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the One Hundred Third Congress, serving one term before his 1994 defeat.

In October 1993, Glickman, representing a district whose second-largest industry was agriculture (particularly wheat production), voted for protectionism over free trade, restricting the importation of Canadian wheat.

On &quot;media freedom&quot; versus &quot;family values&quot; one analyst reported that Glickman, in June 1993, voted to require that television shows have explicit viewer advisories. Glickman would later lead the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which develops such ratings for motion pictures.

In his final term, Glickman was Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He held open hearings to bring the intelligence community&#x27;s post–Cold War activities to light and began a committee investigation into the Aldrich Ames espionage case. Colleagues from both parties lauded his quiet, non-grandstanding, &quot;careful and considered&quot; leadership of the committee.

On abortion, Glickman straddled the fence, generally accommodating abortion, but voting for the Hyde Amendment that restricted federal funding of abortion. In 1993, while on the House Judiciary Committee, he was absent from a key vote on removing most state abortion restrictions, and said later that he was unsure how he would have voted.

====Defeat====
In the Republican-landslide 1994 congressional elections, known as the Republican Revolution, Glickman—in his bid for re-election to a 10th term—was unexpectedly defeated by Goddard Republican Todd Tiahrt.

Glickman later blamed his surprise defeat largely on his own pro-choice positions, which he said opponents used as an &quot;organizing tool&quot; to rally opposition against him from voters who were otherwise politically inactive. In a detailed review of Tiahrt&#x27;s victory, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that Glickman&#x27;s unexpected defeat was largely the product of Tiahrt&#x27;s recruitment of 1,800 volunteers from churches and anti-abortion groups in their congressional district (which had become the center of the national anti-abortion movement), and from gun-rights organizations.

Another casualty of the 1994 Republican congressional sweep was Glickman&#x27;s wife, Rhoda, who, for 13 years, had led the Congressional Arts Caucus—one of 28 caucuses soon to be defunded by the incoming Republican Congress.

====Post-Glickman era====
, no other Democrat has won election to the congressional seat lost by Glickman.

The court-ordered redistricting in 2012 shifted the Fourth District sharply westward, reaching into more conservative Western Kansas.

===Secretary of Agriculture===
Following his congressional defeat, Glickman was appointed by President Bill Clinton to be the Secretary of Agriculture, where he served from 1995 to 2001.

Glickman had sought the post previously but initially lost his bid to Mississippi Congressman Mike Espy. Glickman&#x27;s 1994 appointment to the post followed Espy&#x27;s departure under ethics concerns. Glickman&#x27;s Senate confirmation was supported by a powerful Republican, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, from Glickman&#x27;s home state of Kansas.

During Glickman&#x27;s tenure, he participated in implementation of the Department&#x27;s controversial HACCP Program to control food safety at U.S. food-processing facilities, some of which was subsequently overturned in the federal court Supreme Beef case.

During President Clinton&#x27;s February 4, 1997 State of the Union address to Congress, Glickman was the &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;.

When Clinton&#x27;s term ended, Glickman&#x27;s career in government ended, but was followed by numerous leadership roles in related institutions and organizations.

==Post-government career==
Following his departure from public office, Glickman held a variety of roles in civic-oriented nonprofits. He is a common media interviewee.

===Harvard University===
After Clinton&#x27;s term ended, Glickman became the head of Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and later director of Harvard&#x27;s Institute of Politics.

===Aspen Institute===
Glickman became Executive Director of the Aspen Institute Congressional Program, a nongovernmental, nonpartisan discussion fellowship for public leaders.

===George Washington University===
Glickman is a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Council on American Politics at The Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he teaches.

===University of Southern California===
Glickman is a senior fellow of the Center on Communication Leadership and Policy at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

===Council on Foreign Relations===
Glickman is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, America&#x27;s pre-eminent foreign policy think tank, led by several former U.S. Secretaries of State and other top former national security leaders.

===CIA Advisor===
During President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration, Glickman served on the External Advisory Board to CIA Director Leon Panetta. (Glickman, while in Congress, had chaired the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.)

===Center for U.S. Global Engagement===
Glickman is Chair of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, at the Center for U.S. Global Engagement.

===Refugees International===
Glickman left the Motion Picture Association of America in 2010 to serve as president of Refugees International. He occupied the post for less than three months.

===Food and agriculture===
Glickman&#x27;s political experience in agriculture led to several post-political roles, including:

* Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy: In 2021, Glickman joined the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University as an adjunct professor of the practice, teaching, mentoring, and contributing to the school&#x27;s advocacy and public impact.
* Chicago Mercantile Exchange: Glickman serves on the board of directors
* Food Research and Action Center, a domestic anti-hunger organization
* National 4-H Council, board of trustees: The leading national youth agriculture-education program. Glickman favored the expansion of 4-H urban programs
* Meridian Institute: Glickman co-chairs an initiative of eight foundations, administered by the Meridian Institute, to look at long term implications of food and agricultural policy.
* Institute of Medicine: Glickman chairs an initiative at the Institute of Medicine on &quot;accelerating progress on childhood obesity.&quot; 
* World Food Program-USA: vice-chair 
* Chicago Council on Global Affairs: co-chair of its global agricultural development initiative
* Author of &quot;Farm Futures,&quot; in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; (May/June 2009)

===Issue One – Council for Responsible Social Media===
In October 2022, Glickman joined the Council for Responsible Social Media project launched by Issue One to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus Leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.

===Other roles===
* Communities In Schools, a federation of independent 501(c)(3) organizations in 27 states and the District of Columbia that work to address the &quot;dropout epidemic&quot;—one of the largest dropout-prevention organizations in the U.S., and one of the largest promoters of community-based, integrated student-support services. CIS identifies and mobilizes existing community resources, and fosters cooperative partnerships, such as: mentoring, tutoring, health care, summer and after-school programs, family counseling, and service learning.
* William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan, a not-for-profit, independent, research and educational institute dedicated to creating, aggregating, and disseminating intellectual capital on business and policy issues in emerging markets. It provides a forum for business leaders and public policy makers to discuss issues affecting the environment in which these companies operate.
* Advisory Board member for The Michigan in Washington Program at the University of Michigan. The MIW program offers an opportunity each year for 45–50 undergraduates from any major to spend a semester (Fall or Winter) in Washington D.C. Students combine coursework with an internship that reflects their particular area of interest (such as American politics, international studies, history, the arts, public health, economics, the media, the environment, science and technology). The semester in Washington is rigorous. Students work during the day, attend classes in the evenings, and explore the city on weekends.

==Motion picture industry==
In 2004, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) announced that Glickman would replace Jack Valenti as its chief lobbyist. Glickman served as Chairman and CEO of the MPAA from 2004 to 2012.

When Glickman was named to the MPAA post, his son Jonathan Glickman was serving as President of Spyglass Entertainment Spyglass Media Group and produced such films as &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

A hallmark of Glickman&#x27;s MPAA tenure was his &quot;war on movie piracy&quot;, or the illegal copying and distribution of motion pictures.

In an MPAA press release, May 31, 2006, entitled &quot;Swedish Authorities Sink Pirate Bay&quot;, Dan Glickman stated

The actions today taken in Sweden serve as a reminder to pirates all over the world that there are no safe harbours for Internet copyright thieves
In the 2007 documentary &quot;Good Copy Bad Copy&quot;, Glickman was interviewed in connection with the 2006 raid on The Pirate Bay by the Swedish police, conceding that piracy will never be stopped, but stating that they will try to make it as difficult and tedious as possible.

On January 22, 2010, Glickman announced he would step down as head of the MPAA on April 1, 2010.

Glickman remains, however, a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which dispenses the Motion Picture Academy Awards (Oscars), and the American Film Institute.

<doc id="772728" wikidata="Q1938772" url="?curid=772728" title="Puerto Padre">
<text>Puerto Padre () is a municipality and town in the Las Tunas Province of Cuba. It is located on the northern coastal region of the province, in an estuary (&quot;Estero El Españolito&quot;) that opens into the Puerto Padre Bay.

==History==
Known popularly as the City of Mills, Puerto Padre has a history dating back into the 16th century. In the mid-19th century (1851), the city began its transformation from a small town into an industrial centre with the construction of its first sugarcane mill. The town played a large role in Cuba&#x27;s wars of independence, and today is something of a tourist centre. The founders were Criollo (Creole) landowners of Castilian ancestry and Catalan merchants.

===Columbus&#x27; arrival point theory===
During the 2nd half of the 20th century a group of archaeologists brought forward a theory which disputes the current version of Columbus&#x27; landfall site. They claim that Puerto Padre bay was indeed the first spot in which Columbus landed in Cuba. The commonly accepted site is Bariay bay which is located further east in the province of Holguín. There are several sites which are disputed of being the first landing spot of Columbus and his crew: Puerto Padre and Manatí, both in the province of Las Tunas; and Gibara and Bariay in the province of Holguín).

==Geography==

<text>Taking Lives is a 2004 American psychological thriller film directed by D. J. Caruso and starring Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke, with supporting roles by Kiefer Sutherland, Olivier Martinez, Tchéky Karyo, Jean-Hugues Anglade, and Gena Rowlands. Loosely adapted from the novel of the same name by Michael Pye, the film centers on an enigmatic serial killer who takes on the identities of his victims.

The film was shot on location in Montréal and Quebec City, Quebec. The original music score was composed by Philip Glass and the main title&#x27;s theme was composed by Walter Werzowa of the electronica group Edelweiss.

The film was released in the United States on March 19, 2004 by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received negative reviews.

==Plot==
In 1983, teenagers Martin Asher and Matt Soulsby meet on a bus to Mont-Laurier, Quebec. The bus breaks down, and the two acquire a car, which soon blows a tire. As Matt changes the tire, Martin comments that they are about the same height, and kicks him into the path of an oncoming truck, killing Matt and the driver. Taking Matt&#x27;s guitar and clothes, Martin continues on foot, singing in a voice similar to Matt&#x27;s.

Twenty one years later, FBI profiler Illeana Scott is summoned by Inspector Leclair to help Montreal authorities in apprehending a serial killer who assumes his victims’ identities, enabling him to travel undetected across North America. Illeana interviews art dealer James Costa, an eyewitness to the killer’s most recent murder. James makes a drawing of the killer and the authorities track down the suspect&#x27;s apartment, finding a decaying corpse chained in the ceiling. Martin&#x27;s mother Rebecca claims to have seen her son – believed dead in Matt’s place years earlier – alive on a ferry to Quebec City, leading to the body buried as Martin being exhumed for forensic examination, and he becomes the primary suspect. At Rebecca&#x27;s home, Illeana questions her about her son, learning that Martin was an unwanted child who became unstable after the death of his favored twin brother. Illeana discovers a hidden passageway behind a cabinet leading to Martin’s secret room, where she is attacked by a hidden assailant, who escapes before she can identify him.

Illeana deduces that Asher targets his victims to live as someone different than himself, and that his latest target is James after his apartment is ransacked. James is used in a sting operation to lure Asher, but the trap fails. During a show at his gallery, James is attacked by an assailant, presumed to be Asher, whom Illeana tries to apprehend but loses in the crowd. The police prepare to move James out of town, but he is confronted by the assailant, who attacks him and kills his police escort before driving away with James at gunpoint. Illeana gives chase, and causes the car to crash and explode just as James manages to escape.

James visits Illeana’s hotel room where, having grown close over the course of the investigation, they make passionate love surrounded by gruesome crime scene photos. Illeana awakens to find herself covered in James’ blood, but he has merely popped the stitches he received after the car chase.

As James’ stitches are repaired in the hospital, Illeana is called to the morgue, where Rebecca is unable to identify the charred body of the assailant, and Illeana realizes that Asher must still be alive. Before Illeana can reach her, Rebecca enters the elevator and is confronted by James, revealing himself as the real Martin Asher. He kills his mother, and Illeana is shocked to see him covered in blood before the elevator doors close again, and he escapes the hospital. The police determine that the assailant killed in the car chase was Christopher Hart, a drug addict and art thief to whom Asher owed money. In the struggle in his apartment, Asher killed Hart and staged being taken hostage. Pursued by the police, Asher escapes by train and selects his next victim, taunting Illeana by phone before disappearing. Admitting to having consensual sex with Asher, Illeana is fired from the FBI.

Seven months later, Illeana is living alone in a desolate farmhouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, apparently heavily pregnant with Asher&#x27;s twins. She is confronted by Asher, who declares that they can start over and live together as a family, but Illeana refuses. Enraged, Asher beats her and prepares to choke her into unconsciousness, seizing a pair of scissors from her when she defends herself and stabbing her in the belly. Illeana stabs Asher in the heart with the same scissors and removes her prosthetic pregnant belly, explaining that the past months were a carefully planned trap. Asher dies, and Illeana informs LeClair the ordeal is over.

==Cast==

==Story and writing credit==
The film is based on the novel of the same title by Michael Pye. Numerous hands had a part in the screenplay as script doctors. The cover page of the screenplay credits Jon Bokenkamp with the original draft, Nicholas Kazan with subsequent revisions, Hilary Seitz with more revisions, and David Ayer with the last revisions (to February 28, 2003). The WGA screenwriting credit system ultimately awarded screenplay and adaptation credit to Bokenkamp alone.

==Production==
On April 3, 2001, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez was in negotiations to star in the film, with Tony Scott attached to direct. On September 19, 2002, it was reported that Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke were in talks to topline the thriller. Before Jolie was circling the project, Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow were approached to play the part. On May 9, 2003, Kiefer Sutherland joined the cast, with D. J. Caruso confirmed to helm the film. On May 21, 2003, Olivier Martinez joined the film, Gena Rowlands being also cast in an unspecified role. Principal photography began later that month in Montreal.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film has received mostly poor reviews; Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 22% based on reviews from 157 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A stylish, but predictable thriller where the only thrills are offered by the sensuous Angelina Jolie.&quot; 
Film critic Roger Ebert gave it three out of four stars, describing it as &quot;an effective thriller, on its modest but stylish level&quot;. &quot;Total Film&quot;, a UK film magazine, gave it two stars out of five with the verdict: &quot;Starting off well but rapidly losing its way, &quot;Taking Lives&quot; is more serial-killer flick than serial killer -- we&#x27;ve been fed this mush a thousand times.&quot;

Angelina Jolie earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress for her performance in the movie (also for &quot;Alexander&quot;), but lost the trophy to Halle Berry for &quot;Catwoman&quot;.

Ethan Hawke called the film &quot;terrible&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Taking Lives&quot; grossed $32,682,342 in the United States and $65,470,529 worldwide.

<doc id="772738" wikidata="Q517372" url="?curid=772738" title="Irish republicanism">
<text>Irish republicanism () is the political movement for an Irish republic, void of any British rule. Throughout its centuries of existence, it has encompassed various tactics and identities, simultaneously elective and militant and has been both widely supported and iconoclastic.

The modern emergence of nationalism, democracy, and radicalism provided a basis for the movement, with groups forming across the island in hopes of independence. Parliamentary defeats provoked uprisings and armed campaigns, quashed by British forces. The Easter Rising, an attempted coup that took place in the midst of the First World War, provided popular support for the movement. An Irish republic was declared in 1916 and officialized following the Irish War of Independence. The Irish Civil War, beginning in 1922 and spurred by the partition of the island, then occurred.

Republican action, including armed campaigns, continued in the newly-formed state of Northern Ireland, a region of the United Kingdom. Tensions in the territory culminated in widespread conflict by 1969. This prompted paramilitaries: republicans assembled under the Provisional Irish Republican Army, who waged a campaign against the British state for approximately three decades. Represented by Sinn Féin, republicans would gradually invest in political action, including the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The PIRA have since decommissioned and republicans have been elected to various echelons of government: those within the movement opposed to this outcome are often referred to as dissident republicans.

==History==
===Background of British rule in Ireland===

Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, Ireland, or parts of it, had experienced alternating degrees of rule from England. While some of the native Gaelic population attempted to resist this occupation, a single, unified political goal did not exist amongst the independent lordships that existed throughout the island. The Tudor conquest of Ireland took place in the 16th century. This included the Plantations of Ireland, in which the lands held by Gaelic Irish clans and Hiberno-Norman dynasties were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers (&quot;Planters&quot;) from England and Scotland. The Plantation of Ulster began in 1609, and the province was heavily colonised with English and Scottish settlers.

Campaigns against English presence on the island had occurred prior to the emergence of the Irish republican ideology. In the 1590s and early 1600s, resistance was led by Hugh O&#x27;Neill (see the Nine Years&#x27; War). The Irish chieftains were ultimately defeated, leading to their exile (the &#x27;Flight of the Earls&#x27;) and the aforementioned Plantation of Ulster in 1609.

===1627 Hispano-Irish proposal===
In Europe, prior to the 18th and 19th centuries, republics were in a minority and monarchy was the norm, with few long-lasting republics of note at time, such as the fully-fledged Dutch Republic and the Republic of Venice, as well as the Old Swiss Confederacy and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had republican aspects. However, as noted by Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich, the first ever document proposing a republic of Ireland independent from connections to England dates from 1627. Summaries of these plans are held in the &quot;Archives générales du Royaume&quot; in Belgium and were made familiar to Irish historians by the work of Fr. Brendan Jennings, a Franciscan historian, with his work &quot;Wild Geese in Spanish Flanders, 1582–1700&quot; (1964).

This early republican spirit was not ecumenical and was formed by exiled Irish Catholic Gaels with the support of Habsburg Spain as part of the Irish military diaspora who had fled into Spanish service in the aftermath of the Flight of the Earls during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This was in the context of the break-down of the Spanish match and the onset of the Anglo-Spanish War of 1625–1630. Proposals were made at Madrid, with the involvement of Archbishop Florence Conry and Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, for the Irish Regiment in the Spanish Netherlands then in the service of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, to invade and reconquer the English-controlled Kingdom of Ireland and set up an Irish government loosely aligned with the Habsburg Empire. 

One of the main problems was that within the leadership of the Hispano-Irish diaspora, there were rivalries and factionalism between two primary contenders, Shane O&#x27;Neill and Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, over who should be the overall leader and thus have rights to an Irish throne if the project was a success. A third option was to resolve the conflict between the two factions before an invasion by making them family, with a marriage proposed between Hugh O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s sister Mary Stuart O&#x27;Donnell and Shane O&#x27;Neill, but this broke down. Ministers in Madrid, to Philip IV of Spain, instead drew up proposals on 27 December 1627 for a &quot;Kingdom and Republic of Ireland&quot; and that &quot;the earls should be called Captains General of the said Republic and one could exercise his office on land and the other at sea.&quot; These proposals were approved by Philip IV and forwarded to Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia in Brussels. As the Anglo-Spanish War became more tepid, the plans were never put into practice.

A decade later, the Irish Rebellion of 1641 began. This consisted of a coalition between the Irish Gaels and the Old English (descendants of the Anglo-Norman settlers who settled during the Norman Invasion) rebelling against the English rulers. While some ideas from the 1627 proposals were carried on, the attempt to rally both Gaels and Old English to the banner, mean&#x27;t trying to find common ground and one of these concessions was support for the Stuart monarchy under Charles I of England whom the Old English were strongly attached to. The motto of the Confederation would thus become (&#x27;Irishmen United for God, King and Country&#x27;), with any idea of a republic ditched. Beginning as a with the aim of restoring lost lands in the north of Ireland and defending Catholic religious and property rights, (which had been suppressed by the Puritan Parliament of England) it evolved into the Irish Confederate Wars. In the summer of 1642, the Catholic upper classes formed the Catholic Confederation, which essentially became the government of Ireland for a brief period until 1649, when the forces of the English Parliament carried out the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and the old Catholic landowners were permanently dispossessed of their lands. The most explicit Irish separatist viewpoint from the period, found in , written in Lisbon in 1645 by Fr. Conor O&#x27;Mahony, a Jesuit priest from Munster, argued instead for a Gaelic monarchy to be set up in an explicitly Catholic Ireland, with no mention of a republic.

===Society of United Irishmen and the Irish Rebellion of 1798===

The origin of modern Irish republicanism exists in the ideology and action of the United Irishmen. Founded in 1791 and informed by the Enlightenment, popular sovereignty and the likes of John Locke and Thomas Paine, they initially propagated parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation. Degradation in the legal achievement of these outcomes, coupled with the burgeoning perception of England as a foreign conqueror, inspired revolutionary sentiment and eventual action.

At this stage, the movement was led primarily by liberal Protestants, particularly Presbyterians from the province of Ulster. The founding members of the United Irishmen were mainly Southern Irish Protestant aristocrats. The key founders included Wolfe Tone, Thomas Russell, Henry Joy McCracken, James Napper Tandy, and Samuel Neilson. By 1797, the Society of United Irishmen had around 100,000 members. Crossing the religious divide in Ireland, it had a mixed membership of Catholics, Presbyterians, and even Anglicans from the Protestant Ascendancy. It also attracted support and membership from Catholic agrarian resistance groups, such as the Defenders organisation, who were eventually incorporated into the Society. The Society sought to unite the denominations of the island under the simple distinction of Irish.
The Irish Rebellion of 1798 began on 23 May, with the first clashes taking place in County Kildare on 24 May, before spreading throughout Leinster, as well as County Antrim and other areas of the country. French soldiers landed in Killala on 22 August and participated in the fighting on the rebels&#x27; side. Even though they had considerable success against British forces in County Wexford, rebel forces were eventually defeated. Key figures in the organisation were arrested and executed.

===Acts of Union===
Though the Rebellion of 1798 was eventually put down, small republican guerrilla campaigns against the British Army continued for a short time afterward in the Wicklow Mountains under the leadership of Michael Dwyer and Joseph Holt, involving attacks on small parties of yeomen. These activities were perceived by some to be merely &quot;the dying echoes of an old convulsion&quot;, but others feared further large-scale uprisings, due to the United Irishmen continuing to attract large numbers of Catholics in rural areas of the country and arms raids being carried out on a nightly basis. It was also feared that rebels would again seek military aid from French troops, and another rising was expected take place by 10 April.

This perceived threat of further rebellion resulted in the Parliamentary Union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After some uncertainty, the Irish Parliament voted to abolish itself in the Acts of Union 1800, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, by a vote of 158 to 115. A number of tactics were used to achieve this end. Lord Castlereagh and Charles Cornwallis were known to use bribery extensively. In all, a total of sixteen Irish borough-owners were granted British peerages. A further twenty-eight new Irish peerages were created, while twenty existing Irish peerages increased in rank.

Furthermore, the government of Great Britain sought to replace Irish politicians in the Irish parliament with pro-Union politicians, and rewards were granted to those that vacated their seats, with the result being that in the eighteen months prior to the decision in 1800, one-fifth of the Irish House of Commons changed its representation due to these activities and other factors such as death. It was also promised by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger that he would bring about Catholic emancipation, though after the Acts of Union were successfully voted through, King George III saw that this pledge was never realised, and as such Catholics were not granted the rights that had been promised prior to the Acts.

===Robert Emmet===
A second attempt at forming an independent Irish republic occurred under Robert Emmet in 1803. Emmet had previously been expelled from Trinity College, Dublin for his political views. Like those who had led the 1798 rebellion, Emmet was a member of the United Irishmen, as was his brother Thomas Addis Emmet, who had been imprisoned for membership in the organisation.
Emmet and his followers had planned to seize Dublin Castle by force, manufacturing weaponry and explosives at a number of locations in Dublin. Unlike those of 1798, preparations for the uprising were successfully concealed from the government and law enforcement, and though a premature explosion at an arms depot attracted the attention of police, they were unaware of the United Irishmen activities at the time and did not have any information regarding the planned rebellion. Emmet had hoped to avoid the complications of the previous rebellion and chose not to organise the county outside of Dublin to a large extent. It was expected that the areas surrounding Dublin were sufficiently prepared for an uprising should one be announced, and Thomas Russell had been sent to northern areas of the country to prepare republicans there.

A proclamation of independence, addressed from &#x27;The Provisional Government&#x27; to &#x27;The People of Ireland&#x27; was produced by Emmet, echoing the republican sentiments expressed during the previous rebellion:
However, failed communications and arrangements produced a considerably smaller force than had been anticipated. Nonetheless, the rebellion began in Dublin on the evening of 23 July. Emmet&#x27;s forces were unable to take Dublin Castle, and the rising broke down into rioting, which ensued sporadically throughout the night. Emmet escaped and hid for some time in the Wicklow Mountains and Harold&#x27;s Cross, but was captured on 25 August and hanged on 20 September 1803, at which point the Society of United Irishmen was effectively finished.

===Young Ireland and the Irish Confederation===

The Young Ireland movement began in the late 1830s. The term &#x27;Young Ireland&#x27; was originally a derogatory one, coined by the press in Britain to describe members of the Repeal Association (a group campaigning for the repeal of the Acts of Union 1800 which joined the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain) who were involved with the Irish nationalist newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;. Encouraging the repeal of the Acts of Union, members of the Young Ireland movement advocated the removal of British authority from Ireland and the re-establishment of the Irish Parliament in Dublin. The group had cultural aims also, and encouraged the study of Irish history and the revival of the Irish language. Influential Young Irelanders included Charles Gavan Duffy, Thomas Davis and John Blake Dillon, the three founders of &quot;The Nation&quot;.
The Young Irelanders eventually seceded from the Repeal Association. The leader of the Repeal Association, Daniel O&#x27;Connell, opposed the use of physical force to enact repeal, and passed &#x27;peace resolutions&#x27; declaring that violence and force were not to be employed. Though the Young Irelanders did not support the use of violence, the writers of &quot;The Nation&quot; maintained that the introduction of these peace resolutions was poorly timed, and that to declare outright that physical force would never be used was &#x27;to deliver themselves bound hand and foot to the Whigs.&#x27; William Smith O&#x27;Brien, who had previously worked to achieve compromise between O&#x27;Connell and &quot;The Nation&quot; group, was also concerned, and claimed that he feared these resolutions were an attempt to exclude the Young Irelanders from the Association altogether. At an Association meeting held in July 1846 at Conciliation Hall, the meeting place of the Association, Thomas Francis Meagher, a Young Irelander, addressing the peace resolutions, delivered his &#x27;Sword Speech&#x27;, in which he stated, &quot;I do not abhor the use of arms in the vindication of national rights ... Be it for the defence, or be it for the assertion of a nation&#x27;s liberty, I look upon the sword as a sacred weapon.&quot; John O&#x27;Connell, Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s son, was present at the proceedings and interrupted Meagher&#x27;s speech, claiming that Meagher could no longer be part of the same association as O&#x27;Connell and his supporters. After some protest, the Young Irelanders left Conciliation Hall and the Repeal Association forever, founding the Irish Confederation 13 January 1847 after negotiations for a reunion had failed.

The Young Ireland movement culminated in a failed uprising (see Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848), which, influenced by the French Revolution of 1848 and further provoked by government inaction during the Great Famine and the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which allowed the government to imprison Young Irelanders and other political opponents without trial, was hastily planned and quickly suppressed. Following the abortive uprising, several rebel leaders were arrested and convicted of sedition. Originally sentenced to death, Smith O&#x27;Brien and other members of the Irish Confederation were transported to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.

===Fenian movement===

The Fenian movement consisted of the Fenian Brotherhood and the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), fraternal organisations founded in the United States and Ireland respectively with the aim of establishing an independent republic in Ireland.

The IRB was founded on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 1858 in Dublin. Members present at the first meeting were James Stephens, Thomas Clarke Luby, Peter Langan, Joseph Denieffe, Garrett O&#x27;Shaughnessy, and Charles Kickham. Stephens had previously spent time exiled in Paris, along with John O&#x27;Mahony, having taken part in the uprising of 1848 and fleeing to avoid capture. O&#x27;Mahony left France for America in the mid-1850s and founded the Emmet Monument Association with Michael Doheny. Stephens returned to Ireland in 1856.

The original oath of the society, drawn up by Luby under Stephens&#x27; direction, read:
I, AB., do solemnly swear, in the presence of Almighty God, that I will do my utmost, at every risk, while life lasts, to make [other versions, according to Luby, establish in&#x27;] Ireland an independent Democratic Republic; that I will yield implicit obedience, in all things not contrary to the law of God [ &#x27;laws of morality&#x27;] to the commands of my superior officers; and that I shall preserve inviolable secrecy regarding all the transactions [ &#x27;affairs&#x27;] of this secret society that may be confided in me. So help me God! Amen.

The Fenian Brotherhood was the IRB&#x27;s counterpart organisation, formed in the same year in the United States by O&#x27;Mahony and Doheny. The Fenian Brotherhood&#x27;s main purpose was to supply weapons and funds for its Irish counterpart and raise support for the Irish republican movement in the United States. The term &quot;Fenian&quot; was coined by O&#x27;Mahony, who named the American wing of the movement after the &quot;Fianna&quot; – a class of warriors that existed in Gaelic Ireland. The term became popular and is still in use, especially in Northern Ireland and Scotland, where it has expanded to refer to all Irish nationalists and republicans, as well as being a pejorative term for Irish Catholics.

Public support for the Fenian movement in Ireland grew in November 1861 with the funeral of Terence MacManus, a member of the Irish Confederation, which Stephens and the Fenians had organised – having &quot;recognized the potential of street parades for mobilizing supporters and influencing onlookers&quot;. The popularity endowed by the procession and oration established the tradition of republican funerals, a ritual instrumental as evidenced by the oration at Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa&#x27;s funeral. Popular perception elsewhere deemed the movement as terrorisitic – a persistent perception of republicanism thereafter. Nevertheless, the likes of Rossa would raise the public profile of the movement by their evocation of martyrdom and highlighting of prisoner maltreatment. Support from America proved both lucrative and troublesome as transatlantic members waged a dynamite campaign in Britain. A total of twenty-five major explosions beset Irish nationalism&#x27;s perception and dictated Britain&#x27;s approach towards Ireland and the &quot;Irish question&quot;.

In 1865 the Fenian Brotherhood in America had split into two factions. One was led by O&#x27;Mahony with Stephens&#x27; support. The other, which was more powerful, was led by William R. Roberts. The Fenians had always planned an armed rebellion, but there was now disagreement as to how and where this rebellion might be carried out. Roberts&#x27; faction preferred focusing all military efforts on British Canada (Roberts and his supporters theorised that victory for the American Fenians in nearby Canada would propel the Irish republican movement as a whole to success). The other, headed by O&#x27;Mahony, proposed that a rising in Ireland be planned for 1866. In spite of this, the O&#x27;Mahony wing of the movement itself tried and failed to capture Campobello Island in New Brunswick in April 1866. Following this failure, the Roberts faction of the Fenian Brotherhood carried out its own, occupying the village of Fort Erie, Ontario on 31 May 1866 and engaging Canadian troops at the battles of Ridgeway and Fort Erie on 2 June. It was in reference to Fenians fighting in this battle that the name &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; was first used. These attacks (and those that followed) in Canada are collectively known as the &quot;Fenian raids&quot;.

===Nineteenth century onward===


Irish republican and other independence movements were suppressed by the British authorities following the merging of Ireland with Britain into the United Kingdom after the Act of Union in 1801. Nationalist rebellions against British rule in 1803, by Robert Emmet, 1848 (by the Young Irelanders) and 1865 and 1867 (by the Fenians) were followed by harsh reprisals by British forces.

The National Council, was formed in 1903, by Maud Gonne and Arthur Griffith, on the occasion of the visit of King Edward VII to Dublin. Its purpose was to lobby Dublin Corporation to refrain from presenting an address to the king. The motion to present an address was duly defeated, but the National Council remained in existence as a pressure group with the aim of increasing nationalist representation on local councils. The first annual convention of the National Council on 28 November 1905 was notable for two things: the decision, by a majority vote (with Griffith dissenting), to open branches and organise on a national basis; and the presentation by Griffith of his &#x27;Hungarian&#x27; policy, which was now called the &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; policy. This meeting is usually taken as the date of the foundation of the Sinn Féin party.

In 1916 the Easter Rising, organised by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, was launched in Dublin and the Irish Republic was proclaimed, albeit without significant popular support. The Rising was suppressed after six days, and most of its leaders were executed by the British authorities. This was a turning point in Irish history, leading to the War of Independence and the end of British rule in most of Ireland.

From 1919 to 1921 the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was organised as a guerrilla army, led by Richard Mulcahy and with Michael Collins as Director of Intelligence and fought against the British. During the Anglo-Irish War, the British government formed a paramilitary police force consisting of former soldiers, known as the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;, to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary&#x27;s Auxiliary Division. Republicans were the primary adversary of these forces, whose warfare included pillaging and extrajudicial executions. Both sides used similar tactics: hair cutting, arson attacks, taking of hostages and executions. Republicans also established sovereign courts, a considerable symbol of the movement&#x27;s public support.

In August 1920 Irish Republican prisoners went on a hunger strike demanding release from prison, and reinstatement of their status as political prisoners (1920 Cork hunger strike). Three men died during this time including the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney. Among the most infamous of the Black and Tans actions were the Bloody Sunday massacre in November 1920 and the burning of half the city of Cork in December that same year. These actions, together with the popularity of the republican ideals in Ireland and repression of republican political expressions by the British government, led to widespread support across Ireland for the Irish rebels.

In 1921, the British government led by David Lloyd George negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty with republican leaders led by Arthur Griffith who had been delegated as plenipotentiaries on behalf of the Second Dáil, thus ending the conflict.

===Irish Free State and Republic of Ireland===

Though many across the country were unhappy with the Anglo-Irish Treaty (since, during the war, the IRA had fought for independence for all Ireland and for a republic, not a partitioned dominion under the British crown), some republicans were satisfied that the Treaty was the best that could be achieved at the time. However, a substantial number opposed it. Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament, voted by 64 votes to 57 to ratify it, the majority believing that the treaty created a new base from which to move forward. Éamon de Valera, who had served as President of the Irish Republic during the war, refused to accept the decision of the Dáil and led the opponents of the treaty out of the House. The pro-Treaty republicans organised themselves into the Cumann na nGaedheal party, while the anti-Treaty republicans retained the Sinn Féin name. The IRA itself split between pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty elements, with the former forming the nucleus of the new Irish National Army.

Michael Collins became Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. Shortly afterwards, some dissidents, apparently without the authorisation of the anti-Treaty IRA Army Executive, occupied the Four Courts in Dublin and kidnapped JJ &quot;Ginger&quot; O&#x27;Connell, a pro-Treaty general. The new government, responding to this provocation and to intensified British pressure following the assassination by an anti-treaty IRA unit in London of Henry Wilson, ordered the regular army to take the Four Courts, thereby beginning the Irish Civil War. It is believed that Collins continued to fund and supply the IRA in Northern Ireland throughout the civil war, but, after his death, W. T. Cosgrave (the new President of the Executive Council, or prime minister) discontinued this support.

By May 1923, the war ended in the order by Frank Aiken, telling IRA members to dump arms. However, the harsh measures adopted by both sides, including assassinations, executions and other atrocities, left a bitter legacy in Irish politics for decades to follow. In October 1923 mass hunger strikes were undertaken by Irish republican prisoners protesting the continuation of their internment without trial by the newly formed Irish Free State - three men died during the 1923 Irish Hunger Strikes.

De Valera, who had strongly supported the Republican anti-treaty side in the Civil War, reconsidered his views while in jail and came to accept the ideas of political activity under the terms of the Free State constitution. Rather than abstaining from Free State politics entirely, he now sought to republicanise it from within. However, he and his supporters – which included most Sinn Féin TDs failed to convince a majority of the anti-treaty Sinn Féin of these views and the movement split again. In 1926, he formed a new party called Fianna Fáil (&quot;Soldiers of Destiny&quot;), taking most of Sinn Féin&#x27;s TDs with him. In 1931, following the enactment of the Statute of Westminster, the country became a sovereign state along with the other Dominions and the United Kingdom. The following year, De Valera was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Free State and began a slow process of turning the country from a constitutional monarchy to a constitutional republic, thus fulfilling Collins&#x27;s prediction of &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom&quot;.

By then, the IRA was engaged in confrontations with the Blueshirts, a quasi-fascist group led by a former War of Independence and pro-Treaty leader, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy. O&#x27;Duffy looked to Fascist Italy as an example for Ireland to follow. Several hundred supporters of O&#x27;Duffy briefly went to Spain to volunteer on the Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War, and a smaller number of ex-IRA members, communists and others participated on the Republican side.

In 1937, the Constitution of Ireland was drafted by the de Valera government and approved via referendum by the majority of the population of the Free State. The constitution changed the name of the state to in the Irish language (&quot;Ireland&quot; in English) and asserted its national territory as the whole of Ireland. The new state was headed by a President of Ireland elected by universal suffrage. The new Constitution removed all reference to the monarchy but foreign diplomats continued to present their credentials to the King in accordance with the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 which had not been repealed. The new state had the objective characteristics of a republic and was referred to as such by de Valera himself, but, it remained within the British Commonwealth and was regarded by the British as a Dominion, like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Furthermore, the claim to the whole of the island did not reflect practical reality and inflamed anti-Dublin sentiment among northern Protestants.

In 1948, Fianna Fáil went out of office for the first time in sixteen years. John A. Costello, leader of the coalition government, announced his intention to declare Ireland a republic. The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which &quot;described&quot; the state as the Republic of Ireland (without changing its name or constitutional status), led the British government to pass the Ireland Act 1949, which declared that Northern Ireland would continue as part of the United Kingdom unless the Parliament of Northern Ireland consented to leave; and Ireland ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. As a result of thisand also because continuing struggle against the Dublin government was futilethe republican movement decided to focus on Northern Ireland from then on. The decision was announced by the IRA in its Easter statement of 1949.

==Republicanism in Northern Ireland==
===1921–1966===
The area that was to become Northern Ireland amounted to six of the nine counties of Ulster, in spite of the fact that in the last all Ireland election (1918 Irish general election) counties Fermanagh and Tyrone had Sinn Féin/Nationalist Party (Irish Parliamentary Party) majorities. 
In 1921, Ireland was partitioned. Most of the country became part of the independent Irish Free State. However, six out of the nine counties of Ulster remained part of the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland. During this time (1920–1922) the newly formed Northern Ireland saw &quot;savage and unprecedented&quot; communal violence between unionists and nationalists (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)).

In the 1921 elections in Northern Ireland:
*Antrim, Down and the borough of Belfast had Unionist majorities of over 25%. 
*In County Londonderry, the breakdown in that election was 56.2% Unionist / 43.8% Nationalist. 
*In Armagh, the ratio was 55.3% Unionist / 44.7% Nationalist. 
*In Fermanagh–Tyrone (which was a single constituency), the ratio 54.7% Nationalist / 45.3% Unionist. (Tyrone was 55.4% Catholic in the 1911 census and 55.5% in the 1926 census, though of course only adults had votes on the other hand religious and national affiliations while closely linked are not as absolute as commonly assumed.) Within most of these counties there were large pockets which predominantly nationalist or Unionist (South Armagh, West Tyrone, West Londonderry and parts of North Antrim were largely nationalist whereas much of North Armagh, East Londonderry, East Tyrone and most of Antrim were/are largely Unionist).

This territory of Northern Ireland, as established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, had its own provincial government which was controlled for 50 years until 1972 by the conservative Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). The tendency to vote on sectarian lines and the proportions of each religious denomination ensured that there would never be a change of government. In local government, constituency boundaries were drawn to divide nationalist communities into two or even three constituencies and so weaken their effect (see Gerrymandering).

The (mainly Catholic) Nationalist population in Northern Ireland, besides feeling politically alienated, was also economically alienated, often with worse living standards compared to their Protestant (mainly Unionist) neighbours, with fewer job opportunities, and living in ghettos in Belfast, Derry, Armagh and other places. Many Catholics considered the Unionist government was undemocratic, bigoted and favoured Protestants. Emigration for economic reasons kept the nationalist population from growing, despite its higher birth rate. Although poverty, (e)migration and unemployment were fairly widespread (albeit not to the same extent) among Protestants as well, on the other hand the economic situation in Northern Ireland (even for Catholics) was for a long time arguably still better than in the Republic of Ireland.

During the 1930s the IRA launched minor attacks against the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army in Northern Ireland. During World War II the IRA leadership hoped for support from Germany, and chief of staff Seán Russell travelled there in 1940; he died later that year after falling ill on a U-boat that was bringing him back to Ireland (possibly with a view to starting a German sponsored revolution in Ireland). Suspected republicans were interned on both sides of the border, for different reasons.

The Border Campaign in the mid-50s was the last attempt at traditional military action and was an abject failure.

===1966–1969===
In the late 1960s, Irish political activist groups found parallels between their struggle against religious discrimination and the civil rights campaign of African Americans against racial discrimination in the US. Student leaders such a Bernadette Devlin McAliskey and Nationalist politicians such as Austin Currie tried to use non-violent direct action to draw attention to the blatant discrimination. Republicans, largely demilitarised at the time, engaged considerably with the civil rights campaign. By 1968, Europe as a whole was engulfed in a struggle between radicalism and conservativism. In Sinn Féin, the same debate raged. The dominant analysis was that Protestant Irishmen and women would never be bombed into a united Ireland. The only way forward was to have both sides embrace socialism and forget their sectarian hatreds. They resolved to no longer to be drawn into inter-communal violence.

As a response to the civil rights campaign, militant loyalist paramilitary groups started to emerge in the Protestant community. The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was the first. The UVF had originally existed among loyalist Ulster Protestants before World War I to oppose Home Rule. In the 1960s it was relaunched by militant loyalists, encouraged by certain politicians, to oppose any attempt to reunite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, which is how they saw any change in their status vis-a-vis Catholics.

By mid-1969 the violence in Northern Ireland exploded. Consistent with their new political ideology, the IRA declined to intervene. By late August, the British government had to intervene and declare a state of emergency, sending a large number of troops into Northern Ireland to stop the intercommunal violence. Initially welcomed by some Catholics as protectors, later events such as Bloody Sunday and the Falls Road curfew turned many against the British Army.

===1970–1985===
Divisions began to emerge in the Republican movement between leftists and traditional militants. The leader of the IRA, Cathal Goulding believed that the IRA could not beat the British with military tactics and should turn into a workers&#x27; revolutionary movement that would overthrow both governments to achieve a 32-county socialist republic through the will of the people (after WWII the IRA no longer engaged in any actions against the Republic). Goulding also drove the IRA into an ideologically Marxist–Leninist direction which attracted idealistic young supporters in the Republic, but alienated and angered many of the IRA&#x27;s core supporters in the North. In particular, his decision to regard the UVF as deluded rather than as the enemy, was anathema to traditionalists and those who were its potential victims.

The argument led to a split in 1970, between the Official IRA (supporters of Goulding&#x27;s Marxist line) and the Provisional IRA (also called Provos, traditional nationalist republicans). The Provos were led by Seán Mac Stíofáin and immediately began a large scale campaign against British state forces and economic targets in Northern Ireland. The Official IRA were also initially drawn into an armed campaign by the escalating communal violence. In 1972, the Official IRA declared a cease-fire, which, apart from feuds with other republican groups, has been maintained to date. Nowadays the term &#x27;Irish Republican Army&#x27; almost always denotes the Provisional IRA.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the conflict continued claiming thousands of lives, with the UVF (and other loyalist groups) extending attacks into the Republic of Ireland and the IRA launching attacks on targets in England. However some things slowly began to change. In the 1980s Provisional Sinn Féin (the Provisional IRA&#x27;s political wing) began contesting elections and by the mid-1990s was representing the republican position at peace negotiations. In the loyalist movement splits occurred, the Ulster Unionist Party made tentative attempts to reform itself and attract Catholics into supporting the union with Britain, while the radical Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by Ian Paisley began attracting working-class Protestant loyalists who felt alienated by the UUP&#x27;s overtures towards Catholics.

In 1976 the British government withdrew Special Category Status (prisoner of war rather than criminal status) for convicted paramilitary prisoners. Republican prisoners began a blanket protest which escalated into a dirty protest in 1978. In 1980, seven republican prisoners participated in a hunger strike, which ended after 53 days. The 1981 Irish hunger strike was carried out over a seven-month period with the goal of re-establishing the prisoners political status. This hunger strike drew worldwide attention due to the deaths of ten hunger strikers including Bobby Sands. During the 20th century a total of 22 Irish Republicans have died while on hunger strike.

===Since 1986===
During the late 1980s the British Government became increasingly willing to give concessions to Irish Nationalism, such as the Anglo-Irish Agreement and extending to, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Brooke&#x27;s declaration of &quot;no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland.&quot;, causing uproar amongst strands of Unionism. However, violent Republican action didn&#x27;t cease, giving Unionism and Britain less reason to work with violent Republicans. This situation changed in 1992–93 with Hume&#x27;s-Adams&#x27; talks producing a commitment from Sinn Féin to move towards peaceful methods.
In 1994 the leaders of Northern Ireland&#x27;s two largest nationalist parties, Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin and John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) entered into peace negotiations with Unionist leaders like David Trimble of the UUP and the British government. At the table most of the paramilitary groups (including the IRA and UVF) had representatives. In 1998 when the IRA endorsed the Good Friday Agreement between nationalist and unionist parties and both governments, another small group split from the IRA to form the Real IRA (RIRA). The Continuity and Real IRA have both engaged in attacks not only against the British and loyalists, but even against their fellow nationalists (members of Sinn Féin, the SDLP and IRA).

Since 1998, the IRA and UVF have adhered to a ceasefire.

Today the republican movement can be divided into moderates who wish to reunite with the Republic through peaceful means and dissident republicans who wish to continue an armed campaign. Ideological divides in Northern republicanism has its origins in the late 1970s. Dissidents emphasis the importance of ideology and reject reformism, regarding institutional change as ineffective and whitewashing. Dissidents assert that basis of armed republicanism is sovereignty rather than equality. Some dissidents support the emergence of peace while critiquing the political means.

In late July 2005, the IRA announced that the armed conflict was over and that their weapons were to be put out of use. A large stock of weapons was reportedly &quot;decommissioned&quot; later that year. Some Unionists disputed the claim that this represented the entire stock of IRA weaponry.

==Ideology==
Irish republicanism has encompassed various schools of thought and praxis thereof: &quot;It has embraced ‘militant nationalists, unreconstructed militarists, romantic Fenians, Gaelic Republicans, Catholic sectarians, Northern defenders, international Marxists, socialists, libertarians and liberal Protestants,’&quot; Recurrent ideals include national self-determination and ethno-religious identity.

===Rejection of the British state===
Irish republicans view British rule in any part of Ireland as an inherently illegitimate, foreign regime. A variant of this is Irish republican legitimism, which also rejects the Republic of Ireland because of its tacit acceptance of partition and continuing British rule in Northern Ireland.

The rejection of the legitimacy of British rule extends to all institutions of the British state. This includes rejection of the British parliament (abstentionism), and rejection of British police and court systems, which has led to republicans developing alternatives. Several Irish Republican political parties have, however, contested Northern Irish local elections since the 1970s.

===Violence===

According to Malachi O&#x27;Doherty, Sinn Féin politicians often presented republican terrorist violence as an inevitable result of partition and British rule. This rhetorical device allowed for some republican politicians to evade responsibility for violence and further their political goals of a reunited Ireland. Colonialism and neocolonialism have been invoked by republicans in relation to the movement&#x27;s militancy.

===Connection to left-wing politics===
Irish republicanism was influenced by French radicalism. Typical of these classical Radicals are 19th century such as the United Irishmen in the 1790s, Young Irelanders in the 1840s, Fenian Brotherhood in the 1880s, as well as Sinn Féin, and Fianna Fáil in the 1920s. Although recurring, socialist thought has proven contentious: class interests prioritised by some while others emphasis nationalist rhetoric. The Land War was used to organise republican action with little regard to class conflict. Class politics – coupled with the Northern Irish civil rights movement - have been credited by some republicans to have unduly demilitarised the movement, especially at the onset of the Troubles.

===Relationship with the Christian churches===
A 1983 article examined statements by Irish republicans on the issue of religion, and found that the attitudes contrasted with &quot;the commonsense view&quot; that Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA supported Catholics and opposed Protestants. There has been long-standing mutual dislike between the Catholic hierarchy and the Republican movement, with the latter seeing the former as complicit in British occupation of Ireland. In Belfast, during the time of partition, republicanism was rejected by the majority of the Catholic population, including the clergy.

Articles in &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; often upheld the morality of parish priests and pastors of all Christian denominations rather than bishops and church leaders, with respect for the Christian tradition of social justice. The article said that &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; &quot;bends over backwards to be sympathetic to men who have expressed consistently anti-Catholic sentiments&quot;, including at times the Loyalist leader Ian Paisley, as they are seen as fellow Irish citizens whereas the British forces are seen as the principal enemy.

Republicans have often denied that their attacks on the Ulster Defence Regiment or Royal Ulster Constabulary are sectarian attacks on Protestants by claiming that they attack these groups because they are seen as complicit in &quot;the oppression of the nationalist people&quot; and not because of the religious beliefs of the members. However, a series of attacks in the Troubles, such as the Kingsmill massacre, that collectively killed 130 Protestant civilians were classified as &quot;sectarian&quot; in Malcolm Sutton&#x27;s work on those killed during the Troubles. This makes sectarian killings of civilians 7% of the total killings attributed to the IRA (1,823), as opposed to the loyalist paramilitaries, of whose 1,027 killings, 70% or 718 were deliberate sectarian killings of Catholic civilians.

=== Historiography ===
The history of republicanism is paramount to the ideology: &quot;The story of the past told by republicans is one of oppression, resistance, solidarity, and sacrifice...which both defines and justifies the movement&quot;. The remembrance of republicans as equally dutiful and ordinary is used to justify action and assert victimhood, with memorialisation at large assuming a rhetorical purpose.

&quot;[M]aintain[ing] fidelity&quot; and upholding sacrificial notions function as an &quot;imperative&quot; for republicans: commemoration, thus, is both ubiquitous and political as evidenced by Sinn Féin&#x27;s literature and rationale during the peace process. During the process, the ambitions of the civil rights movement were contended as &quot;the ultimate goal of the conflict&quot;, thus emphasing a continuity. The predominance of memory is a point of critique, lambasted as limiting and dogmatic and, in terms of Northern Ireland, commemoration has inspired controversy.

Events of particular significance include the United Ireland Rebellion, the Easter Rising and the War of Independencethe centenary of the Rising unified nationalists in commemoration, &quot;loyalty to the 1916 Republic&quot; being a fundamental present in all sects of republicanism. The proclamation of said republic drew upon the past itself in justifying action.

==Political parties==
===Active republican parties===
The following are active republican parties in Ireland.
*Sinn Féin is a republican party in Ireland. Throughout the Northern Ireland troubles, it was closely allied with the Provisional Irish Republican Army, publicly arguing for the validity of its armed campaign. Its policy platform combines civic nationalism with democratic socialist views on economic and social issues. It is led by Mary Lou McDonald and organises in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Party was also known as &quot;&quot;Provisional&quot; Sinn Féin by the media and commentators, having split from what later became known as the &quot;Official&quot;&quot; Sinn Féin (later the Workers&#x27; Party) in 1970, because the latter had voted to enter a &#x27;partitionist parliament&#x27;. In 1986, it reversed its original policy of not taking seats in Dáil Éireann, prompting another split, when Republican Sinn Féin was formed. By the early 21st century it had replaced the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as Northern Ireland&#x27;s largest nationalist party. As of 2020, it holds seven seats in the British parliament, thirty-seven seats in the Dáil, six in the Seanad and 26 in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Sinn Féin members contest elections to the British parliament on an abstentionist basis, that is, they refuse to take their seats in that parliament as they refuse to accept the right of that body to rule in any part of Ireland.
* Fianna Fáil was founded as an expressly republican party, one born out of Sinn Féin but which dropped abstentionism in order to engage in constitutional politics in Ireland. In fact, Seán Lemass had originally desired for the name of the party to simply be &quot;The Republican Party&quot;, however, Éamon de Valera muted that idea in favour of a name inspired by the Irish language and culture. Since the 1930s and 1940s, a period which saw Fianna Fáil imprison physical force Republicans en masse, to what degree Fianna Fáil can be still described as &quot;Republican&quot; has been contested. The party itself, however, continues to frame itself as a Republican party; indeed in 1971 the party&#x27;s commitment to this was signalled when the formal name of the party was altered to &quot;Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party&quot;. Following the 2020 Irish general election, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald spoke often of forming a coalition which would produce a &quot;Republican programme for Government&quot;. Some suggested this choice of language was chosen to encourage Fianna Fáil to work with Sinn Féin under a united &quot;Republican&quot; banner. 
*Éirígí is a socialist republican political party that formed by a small group of community and political activists who had left Sinn Féin, in Dublin in April 2006 as a political campaigns group, and became a full-fledged political party at the party&#x27;s first Ardfheis (conference) in May 2007. An Independent Monitoring Commission report said the group was &quot;a small political grouping based on revolutionary socialist principles&quot;. While it continues to be a political association, albeit, with aggressive protest activities, it was not seen as paramilitary in nature.
* Saoradh is a socialist republican party created in 2016. It is associated with dissident Republicans and is alleged to have ties to the New IRA. 
*Republican Sinn Féin was formed in 1986 by former Sinn Féin leader Ruairí Ó Brádaigh who led traditional republicans in a break with Sinn Féin over the ending of the policy of abstention in relation to elections to Dáil Éireann. The party continues to operate on an abstentionist basis: it would not take seats in the assemblies of either the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland because it views neither as legitimate. It is linked to the Continuity IRA, whose goals are the overthrow of British rule in Northern Ireland and the unification of the island to form an independent country. In November 2009, Des Dalton replaced Ó Brádaigh as leader of Republican Sinn Féin.
*Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) was founded in 1974 by former Official IRA militant Seamus Costello, who possibly had an eye towards James Connolly&#x27;s Irish Socialist Republican Party of the late 19th/early 20th century when coining the party&#x27;s name. Costello led other former Official IRA members dissatisfied with Cathal Goulding&#x27;s policies and tactics. The party quickly organised a paramilitary wing called the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) which has decommissioned recently. It claims to follow the principles of republican socialism as set out by the 1916 rebellion leader Connolly and radical 20th-century trade unionist James Larkin.
* Aontú, who split from Sinn Féin in 2019 in opposition to the party&#x27;s support for the Repeal of the Eighth Amendment, which allowed for the legalisation of abortion in Ireland in 2018. As of 2024, Aontú has two TDs including party leader Peadar Tóibín, and five councillors across Ireland.
*Republican Network for Unity was formed in 2007 in opposition to the Sinn Féin special Ard Fheis&#x27;s vote of support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A number of commentators view RNU as the political wing of Óglaigh na hÉireann, a militant dissident republican paramilitary group. That group committed to a ceasefire in 2017, which RNU supported.
*Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland (AIA) are a socialist republican organisation founded in 2017. The group opposes the Good Friday Agreement and abstains from elections.

===Defunct republican parties===
The following were republican parties in Ireland which are no longer active.
* Clann Éireann split from Cumann na nGaedheal in 1926 after the results of the Irish Boundary Commission confirmed partition between Ireland and Northern Ireland. They called for a &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Ireland, but found little support as those already of the anti-partition mindset were already aligned with Fianna Fáil, and were not favourable to those who had previously been in Cumann na nGaedhael. 
* The Republican Congress was an attempt in 1934 by left-wing republicans to set up an explicitly socialist republican party in Ireland, however, it was hampered by the fact the IRA had no interest in supporting the endeavour (and in fact, the IRA expelled members who tried to be a part of both), and because it was torn apart almost immediately because of infighting. Members of the Republican Congress, which counted amongst its membership several of the most prominent socialists in Ireland at the time, could not decide whether they should immediately seek a &quot;Workers Republic&quot; or not, nor could they agree if they should embrace the idea of a Popular Front with non-socialists or not. 
* Córas na Poblachta were an Irish republican party set up in 1940, supported by elements of the IRA. With the IRA at this point under the control of Seán Russell, it had seen a swing heavily to the right. Córas na Poblachta reflected that, the party entertaining relations with the Fascist party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe and some meetings of Córas na Poblachta were even attended by Eoin O&#x27;Duffy and members of the Irish Christian Front, all of whom had bitterly opposed the IRA in the early 30s. With &quot;The Emergency&quot; in full effect, there was little appetite or room to grow a political party in Ireland at the time and thus in practical terms Córas na Poblachta did very little. 
* Clann na Poblachta were an Irish republican party set up in 1947 by former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride. The party contained a broad political spectrum of Irish republicans, from former Communists to &quot;traditionalist&quot; republicans. The party settled on a centre-left platform promoting Social Democracy and New Deal style politics that suited the new political era of post-World War 2 Europe. Initially, they hoped to overtake Fianna Fáil as the main republican party in Irish politics and were projected to do very well, but savvy electoral manoeuvring by Éamon de Valera saw them falter in their first election. After they entered a coalition that included the traditional opponents of Irish republicanism, Fine Gael and ran into political turmoil over the Mother and Child Scheme, the party rapidly lost support. However, they were successful in formally declaring that Ireland was a Republic in 1948 . Their influence waned throughout the 1950s and they were formally wound up by 1965. 
* Aontacht Éireann were an Irish republican party set up in 1971 following a major political rift in Fianna Fáil caused by the Arms Crisis, in which Fianna Fáil ministers Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney were dismissed from cabinet following allegations they were involved in arranging for the IRA to be supplied with weaponry. The fallout of this caused many Fianna Fáil members to resign, amongst them Fianna Fáil minister Kevin Boland. Boland left Fianna Fáil and setup Aontacht Éireann to be a more openly republican party in Irish politics. He was joined by the likes of sitting Fianna Fáil TD Seán Sherwin. Although there was quite an amount of interest in Aontacht Éireann initially, with branches set up across Ireland, the party struggled to maintain its momentum. When Boland had resigned from Fianna Fáil, he not only gave up his cabinet position but also his seat in the Dáil as well. Without the platform to the speak in the Dáil, Boland was somewhat sidelined. The party also struggled to meaningfully separate itself from Provisional Sinn Féin, with much of the policies and the rhetoric of the party membership mirroring each other. The party only managed to take 0.9% of the national vote at the 1973 Irish general election and by 1976 the vast majority of the original membership had moved on from the party. It was formally wound up in 1984, after a period in which a far-right group has usurped the party&#x27;s name and used it for their own ends for a time.

<text>Dmitry Vladimirovich Bilozerchev (, born 22 December 1966 in Moscow) is a Russian gymnastics coach and retired gymnast who represented the Soviet Union. One of the most accomplished gymnasts in history, he is a two-time World All-Around Champion and three-time Olympic Champion. He trained at the Armed Forces sports society in Moscow.

Known for his exemplary form, style, and technique, in 1983 Bilozerchev became the youngest men&#x27;s World All-Around Champion in history. He then went on to win 5 gold medals at the 1984 Friendship Games, which served as the alternate Olympic Games for the communist nations that boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The following year, he shattered his leg in 41 places in a car crash. The injury was so devastating that doctors were going to amputate the limb were it not for his status as World Champion. In a remarkable comeback, Bilozerchev went on to reclaim his title as World All-Around Champion in 1987 even though his leg was never the same. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, he won gold medals in the pommel horse, still rings, and in the team competition. He took bronze in the All-Around competition after a mistake on the horizontal bar. Had the competition been held under the new life rule, where all previous scores are dropped, he would have won the gold medal over teammate Vladimir Artemov.

In 1993, he moved to the United States. Together with his wife he owns &quot;The United Sports Academy&quot; in Beaverton, Oregon, where he coaches gymnastics. His son Aleksey and daughter Alice are also artistic gymnasts. In 2003, he was inducted to the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

<doc id="772743" wikidata="Q2719287" url="?curid=772743" title="Zombiepowder.">
<text>Zombiepowder. (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo. The manga ran in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; for 27 chapters from August 1999 to February 2000 before being canceled. The series was collected into four &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, released the following year. &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; is distributed in North America by Viz Media, who licensed it in 2005. Although critical reception in the United States was largely mediocre, the series achieved moderate commercial success in the western market due to the prominence Kubo had achieved by that point for his second manga series, &quot;Bleach&quot;.

&quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; follows a teenaged boy named Elwood Shepherd, who joins with mysterious criminals Gamma Akutabi and C.T. Smith in their search for the Rings of the Dead. These rings are a group of legendary artifacts with the power to resurrect the dead and grant immortality to anyone who collects 12 of them. The series has a Weird West setting which mixes a background of sparsely populated frontier settlements and gunslinger aesthetics with modern conveniences, occult magic, supernatural martial arts, and mad science. The trio travel from town to town in this world, fighting other criminals for possession of the Rings of the Dead. The protagonists obtain three of the rings in the course of the story, but due to the series&#x27; cancellation, the eventual success or failure of their quest is unknown.

The series was a commercial failure in Japan but has been successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action.

==Setting and plot==
&quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; is set within a western-themed environment with inconsistent levels of technology, similar to that found in Yasuhiro Nightow&#x27;s manga series, &quot;Trigun&quot;. The most prominent characters in the series are Powder Hunters, individuals who seek the titular Zombie Powder, a life-giving substance that can imbue an individual with limitless life force, capable of granting immortality and even raising people back from the dead. Zombie Powder can only be obtained from the Rings of the Dead, dangerous magical artifacts that (individually) devour the vitality of anyone they touch, rendering them comatose; this stolen life energy is converted into the Zombie Powder, which can only be extracted if twelve Rings of the Dead are brought together.

The story begins with young pickpocket, John Elwood Shepherd befriending Powder Hunter, Gamma Akutabi after a botched attempt to rob him. It also turns out Gamma is a highly wanted fugitive in possession of a Ring of the Dead; because of this, when another member of the local gang Elwood is working sees them together, he assumes that Elwood&#x27;s harboring him in hopes of turning him over for his bounty. The gang attacks Elwood&#x27;s home, and Gamma comes to the rescue, but not before Elwood&#x27;s sister, Sheryl, is killed by the gang&#x27;s leader. Following the gang&#x27;s assault, Elwood decides to accompany Gamma in his powder hunting in hopes of resurrecting Sheryl.

After leaving Elwood&#x27;s hometown, the pair meet up with Gamma&#x27;s long-time partner C.T. Smith, another Powder Hunter who&#x27;s also wanted. Smith has infiltrated the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which has found a Ring of the Dead. The three challenge the gang&#x27;s leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays him using his mastery of the fictional sword art &quot;karin zanjutsu&quot;, which involves the user channeling their own bloodlust and manifesting it as pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of the Dead, concluding the first arc and volume of the series.

The remaining three volumes concern themselves with the battle for a third ring, which has been embedded for years in the body of a comatose young man named Emilio Lufas Getto. Gamma and company learn of Emilio&#x27;s existence from his sister, Wolfina, a tabloid photojournalist and vigilante who does not believe in the Rings of the Dead. The group of hunters offer to restore Emilio to consciousness in exchange for the ring he contains. Before they can do so, however, Emilio is kidnapped by Balmunk the Mystic, a powder hunting magician who leads a circus-themed gang. Wolfina teams up with Elwood, Gamma, and Smith to retrieve Emilio, and they succeed in doing so after a number of battles with Balmunk&#x27;s henchmen. The conflict culminates in a fight between Gamma and a giant golem summoned by Balmunk, which Gamma defeats with the help of a berserk state. Balmunk is beaten but not killed, and departs whilst swearing revenge upon Gamma.

After rescuing Emilio, Gamma arranges to have the Ring of the Dead removed from his body by an old friend, mad scientist Nazna Gemini. The characters are brought to Gemini&#x27;s lab by Angelle Cooney, a young girl with the power of teleportation. Once there, Gemini agrees to operate to remove the ring from Emilio in exchange for a year of experimentation rights on Wolfina.

Due to the series&#x27; early cancellation, &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; is ended without a solid conclusion, the final chapter showing Gamma and Smith leaving Elwood and Wolfina behind as they depart the Gemini Laboratory, whose staff have just begun the operation to save Emilio. It is left ambiguous whether Elwood chooses to follow Gamma and Smith, stay with Wolfina and Emilio, or become a Powder Hunter in his own right.

==Characters==
:Gamma, the team leader and main combatant of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;″s cast, is a 22-year-old Powder Hunter who desires the Zombie Powder for the sake of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma is one of the most wanted criminals in the &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma&#x27;s character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma&#x27;s personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a Powder Hunter following the death of a woman.
:Throughout the series, Gamma bests his enemies using his superhuman strength and speed, a steel-plated right arm which allows him to catch bullets, and a large sword-chainsaw hybrid. Other abilities Gamma possesses are mastery of , a fictional ancient martial art which grants him a controllable aura called the &quot;Black Flame of Death&quot;, and a berserk state Balmunk refers to as Gamma&#x27;s &quot;Black Monster.&quot; Neither of these elements is fully explained in the course of the story.
:Theron Martin of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; considered Gamma to be a typical &quot;bad-ass anti-hero&quot;, good at creating mayhem and not much else. IGN&#x27;s review of the series treated him similarly, saying his role of &quot;protagonist who wields a lot of power and hides a dark secret&quot; was done effectively but not remarkably, and was typical of shōnen action manga. Alexander Gorban of the Russian &quot;Animemaniacs Magazine&quot; believed Gamma&#x27;s typical nature as a hero with an inner demon was offset by the character&#x27;s &quot;devilish charm&quot; and portrayed willingness to fight to the last breath to not lose his humanity. He noted that aspects of this personality were reused for &quot;Bleach&quot; protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki, who would also bear some similarities in physical appearance to Gamma. Gorban felt, however, that these same strengths of character made Gamma dominate the cast, and that &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; would have been improved if he had simply been its sole protagonist.
:John Elwood Shepherd, referred to more commonly as Elwood, is a 13-year-old pickpocket who joins up with Powder Hunters Gamma and Smith in an effort to resurrect his dead sister, Sheryl Ann Shepherd. He is introduced in the first chapter of the series. His character is named after Gotee Records co-founder Joey Elwood, a real-life music producer whose name Kubo thought fit Elwood&#x27;s character design perfectly. Elwood has great talent with throwing knives, and is ingenious in combat, but struggles to overcome his sidekick status and measure up to the abilities of his superhuman partners. Smith and Gamma both see Elwood as a younger version of Gamma, which fills Gamma with hope and pride, but also the fear that Elwood may turn to evil. This concern prompts Smith and Gamma to leave Elwood behind at Gemini Laboratory at the end of the manga, so that he can find his own way without Gamma&#x27;s influence. Whether Elwood decides to follow the pair or not is left ambiguous.
:Reviewers of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; found Elwood&#x27;s character mostly unremarkable, due to his similarity to numerous other tag-along/protégé characters found in manga. Ed Chavez, reviewer for MangaCast said he grew &quot;fond of&quot; his character while he read, but that he suffered from sidelining by Gamma, while Den of Geek thought his motivation for seeking the zombie powder was an effective twist on the usual plot device of avenging a dead relative.
:C.T. Smith is introduced in the third chapter of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; as an apparent antagonist, a hired assassin working for the Ash Daughters gang. This is, however, a disguise, and Smith is actually Gamma&#x27;s long-standing partner in powder hunting. Smith is the least developed member of the main cast, with little known backstory or motivation. It is implied that he is, like Gamma, an infamously dangerous criminal. Smith possesses superhuman speed and dexterity, is above-average at everything, and fights using handguns and an armored briefcase. He has no other known abilities but, according to the duo, Gamma and Smith are incapable of killing each other. Tite Kubo&#x27;s character commentary for Smith in volume one states that Smith&#x27;s appearance was based on a London banker, and notes that the &quot;C.T.&quot; in his name was eventually meant to hold some plot significance.
:Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was considered more novel. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; said he was one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who&#x27;s actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast&#x27;s reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. &quot;Animemaniacs Magazine Online&quot; noted that Smith&#x27;s physical appearance was later echoed by &quot;Bleach&quot;″s central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.
:Wolfgangina Getto, nicknamed &quot;Wolfina&quot;, is an 18-year-old paparazzi journalist who specializes in criminal exposé stories. Her brother, Emilio, hosts a Ring of the Dead that he found 8 years before the main storyline. The ring has been consuming his life force ever since, forcing him into a coma. Wolfina is introduced in the ninth chapter of the series, and joins up with the main characters soon after in order to protect her brother from Balmunk. She fights using a modified camera tripod she calls the &quot;Tripod of Justice&quot;. At the end of the series, she agrees to work for Zanza Gemini for a year as an experimental subject in order to pay for the operation of removing the Ring of the Dead from Emilio. She is thus left behind by Gamma and Smith as they continue their powder hunting.
:Critical reaction to Wolfina&#x27;s character was limited, with reviewers contrasting her large-breasted character design to the otherwise lanky, shōjo manga-esque designs used in the series and praising her novel weapon choice.
:Baragne Balmunk (referred to by his stage name &quot;Balmunk the Mystic&quot;) is a sorcerer, Powder Hunter and serial killer nearly as wanted as Gamma. He gathers the Rings of the Dead solely for the excitement seeking them brings. Balmunk is introduced in the eleventh chapter, and takes the role of primary antagonist for the remainder of the series. Balmunk leads a gang made up of criminals with superpowers and weaponry based on traditional circus acts and freak show performances, such as fire swallowing and the box-impalement trick. His magical powers include summoning abilities which allow him to create weapons, call upon henchmen and beasts (such as tigers) and, with his most powerful technique, is able to create a giant golem named &quot;Amantine&quot; from one of his own limbs. Balmunk kidnaps Emilio in order to obtain the Ring of the Dead within him, but is defeated by Gamma. Balmunk holds a personal grudge towards Gamma, and knows about Gamma&#x27;s berserker personality. The history behind their rivalry is never revealed, though he states that Gamma nearly killed him once before.
:Balmunk and his circus troupe were received positively by reviewers, which considered the group a colorful and creepy opposing threat. A scene at the end of volume 2 in which Balmunk offers to return Emilio&#x27;s body to Wolfina unharmed, but without his head, was cited by MangaCast as an eerie and effective character builder. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; said his character was a unique application of the circus villains trope that, while not original, is a rarity in Eastern comics, and rarely done so &quot;outlandishly&quot; even in the West. Alexander Gorban considered Balmunk the best-written character in the series, and his arc a &quot;grand circus&quot; of memorable scenes and battles thanks to his personal charisma and the author&#x27;s resourcefulness in selecting powers for Balmunk and his troupe.

==Production and release==
According to Tite Kubo, &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; originated as an idea for a samurai manga which would have been titled &quot;Samurai Drive.&quot; This initial conception of the story had very little in common with the end product, as it did not feature western elements or the titular zombie powder. It did star a version of Gamma, however, who still bore an over-sized sword and bounty, and featured scifi technologies. With respect to the premise of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;, the author stated that the theme was fighting, and a world where the hope for resurrection lay not in god, but obtaining a mysterious substance. Tite Kubo did not comment on his influences for the series, but critic Theron Martin believed its tone, setting, and style drew heavily on the cyberpunk manga &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, the dark fantasy manga &quot;Berserk&quot;, and fellow sci-fi/western manga &quot;Trigun&quot;, and A.E. Sparrow of IGN noted the obligatory genre influence of martial arts anime &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. The series also borrows terminology from the music industry, referring to each chapter as a track, the bonus omake content in each volume as B-Sides, and naming primary character Elwood after a record label founder.

&quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; began serialization in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on August 2, 1999, and ran a brief 27 chapters before being canceled on February 28, 2000. According to the author&#x27;s commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo was in a state of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it, and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;, and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor&#x27;s comments rather than trusting his own ideas. Other than Tite Kubo, &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; had five credited staff, though their exact roles in its production were never specified.

The series was collected into four volumes, published in 2000 in Japan. &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; was licensed for English distribution by Viz Media in 2005, following the success of Tite Kubo&#x27;s second manga series, &quot;Bleach&quot;. The first English volume was released in the United States in September 2006, and the last was released in June 2007. A French-language edition began publication through Tonkam in 2013.

The Viz Media releases preserve the Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering was criticized for being overly large, which &quot;Anime News Network&quot; thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding a gun to his own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2–4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo&#x27;s career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: &quot;Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine&quot;, &quot;Rune Master Urara&quot;, and &quot;Bad Shield United&quot;, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;″s primary English-speaking audience of &quot;Bleach&quot; fans interested in the development of Tite Kubo&#x27;s style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz&#x27;s normal releases, to standard pagecounts.

==Reception==

&quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; sold modestly in Japan, but has been commercially successful in the United States. The second volume placed in the top 100 graphic novels for Christmas 2006. Theron Martin of Anime News Network believed the series could have achieved some success in the United States without the &quot;Bleach&quot; connection due to the American market&#x27;s larger appetite for series which focus on violent action, but that the series was heavily buoyed by &quot;Bleach&quot;″s international popularity, and primarily imported for an audience of &quot;Kubo .&quot;

Critical reception of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; as a whole mostly deemed it mediocre and average. Two reviews from Anime News Network ranked it as a C, it received a C+ review from MangaCast, a Den of Geek review gave it 3/5 stars, and an IGN review concluded it was &quot;no better or worse many other shōnen titles&quot; with &quot;not much to separate it from the massive stock of shōnen series that are similar to it.&quot; Jason Thompson included it in a list of &quot;mediocre&quot; shōnen action titles whose clichéd nature and &quot;ripped-off&quot; character designs left them interesting only to readers unacquainted with the tropes of the genre. The universal criticism in these reviews is that the series as a whole lacks originality, with most mentioning that it reads very much like the author&#x27;s first effort it is, and would therefore appeal mostly to fans of the author. While he echoed most individual criticisms of the English-language reviewers, a divergent conclusion was reached by Russian critic Alexander Gorban of &quot;Animemaniacs Magazine Online&quot;, who believes that &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;″s fundamentals were all strong, and that the failure of the series in Japan was instead due to Tite Kubo&#x27;s overreach in publishing a series in the highly-competitive &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; at such a young age. Had the freshman author been serialized in a less prominent magazine, asserts Gorban, &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; would have been allowed longer to establish itself and could have developed into a series at least as good as &quot;Bleach&quot;.

Reception for individual elements of &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed sufficient for the needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to &quot;Trigun&quot;, and seeming to be chosen just for the sake of coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.

Of all the elements of the series, &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;″s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was &quot;the entire sum and substance&quot; of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume&#x27;s flap: &quot;The theme is fighting. Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read,&quot; and said that if this advice was taken &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot; could be a &quot;great shōnen tale&quot;, but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban&#x27;s view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found &quot;Zombiepowder.&quot;″s &quot;wall-to-wall&quot; action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.

<text>The Radio Academy Awards, started in 1983, were the most prestigious awards in the British radio industry. For most of their existence, they were run by ZAFER Associates, but in latter years were brought under the control of The Radio Academy.

The awards were generally referred to by the name of their first sponsor, Sony, as The Sony Awards, The Sony Radio Awards or variations. In August 2013, Sony announced the end of its sponsorship agreement with The Radio Academy after 32 years. Consequently, the awards were named simply &quot;The Radio Academy Awards&quot;. In November 2014, it was announced that The Radio Academy would not be holding the awards in 2015, and would be looking for other ways to recognise achievement in the future.

The awards were relaunched in 2016 as the Audio &amp; Radio Industry Awards (ARIAS).

== Awards format ==
The awards were organised into various categories, with nominees being announced a few weeks before the main awards ceremony. The categories varied slightly each year, and were decided by an annual committee, with the aim to include all the main areas from music, news and speech through to radio drama, comedy and sport, and not discriminating against station size, or niche categories.

In most categories, five entries were shortlisted with the top three awarded Bronze, Silver and Gold. Some categories (such as the Station of the Year categories) only three entries were shortlisted, with only a Gold winner awarded. In a number of special categories (such as The Gold Award or Special Award) there was no shortlist, merely a winner.
