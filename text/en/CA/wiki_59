<text>Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen (6 November 1919 – 2 July 2004) was a Portuguese poet and writer. Her remains have been entombed in the National Pantheon since 2014.

==Life and career==
Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen was born on 6 November 1919 in Porto, Portugal. She was the daughter of Maria Amélia de Mello Breyner and João Henrique Andresen. She had Danish ancestry on her father&#x27;s side, notably her paternal great-grandfather, Jan Andresen, who had traveled alone to Porto as a boy and never left the region. In 1895, Sophia&#x27;s grandfather bought Quinta do Campo Alegre, now known as the Porto Botanical Garden, where he raised his family. As stated by Sophia in a 1993 interview, the house and grounds were &quot;a fabulous territory with a large and rich family served by a large household staff.&quot; 

Her mother, Maria Amélia de Mello Breyner, was the daughter of Tomás de Mello Breyner, Count of Mafra, a medical doctor of distant Austrian descent and friend of King D. Carlos. Maria Amélia is also the granddaughter of the capitalist Henrique Burnay, from a Belgian family living in Portugal, and future Count of Burnay.

Sophia began her studies at the new Sacred Heart of Jesus College, at 1354 Avenida da Boavista, Porto, entering with the school&#x27;s first class.

Raised in a mix of bourgeois and old Portuguese aristocracy and educated with traditional Christian morality, she was leader of Catholic university movements while taking classes in Classical Philology at the University of Lisbon (1936-1939), which she never concluded. She collaborated with the magazine &quot;Cadernos de Poesia&quot;, where she made friends with influential and well-known authors: Ruy Cinatti and Jorge de Sena. In time, she became one of the most representative figures of a liberal political attitude, supporting the monarchic movement and denouncing Prime minister Salazar&#x27;s regime and its followers. The song called &quot;Cantata da Paz&quot;, became famous as an intervention song of the Progressive Catholics: &quot;We see, hear and read. We cannot ignore!&quot;

In 1946, she married journalist, politician and lawyer Francisco Sousa Tavares (who she would divorce in 1988) and became mother of five children: Isabel, Maria, a university literature professor, Miguel, a journalist and writer, Sofia and Xavier, a painter and ceramist. Her children motivated her to write children&#x27;s books.

In 1964, Andresen received the Grand Prize of Poetry by the Portuguese Society of Writers for her book &quot;Livro Sexto&quot;. After the Revolution of 25 April, she was elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1975 by the Porto circle on a Socialist Party list while her husband joined the Social Democratic Party.

Andersen won acclaim as a storyteller with &quot;Contos Exemplares&quot; (Exemplary Tales), &quot;Histórias da Terra e do Mar&quot; (Stories of Land and Sea), and a number of children&#x27;s books – &quot;A Menina do Mar&quot; (The Sea Girl), &quot;O Cavaleiro da Dinamarca&quot; (The Danish Knight), &quot;A Floresta&quot; (The Forest), &quot;O Rapaz de Bronze&quot; (The Bronze Boy), &quot;A Fada Oriana&quot; (The Fairy Oriana). She also published several poetry books and anthologies, including: &quot;Poesia&quot;, &quot;Dual&quot;, &quot;Livro Sexto&quot;, &quot;Coral&quot;, &quot;Dia do Mar&quot;, &quot;No Tempo Dividido&quot;, &quot;Grades&quot;, &quot;O Nome das Coisas&quot;, &quot;As Ilhas&quot;, &quot;Antologia&quot;, &quot;Geografia&quot;, &quot;Navegações&quot;, &quot;O Búzio de Cós&quot;. In 1999 she became the first woman to receive the highest Portuguese award for poetry, the Prémio Camões (Camões Prize). She was also awarded the Max Jacob Poetry Prize, in 2001, and the Spanish Prémio Reina Sofia in 2003.

Besides her work as a writer, she translated Dante and Shakespeare into Portuguese.

=== Later years ===

Andresen died at the age of 84 on 2 July 2004 in Lisbon, at Pulido Valente Hospital. Initially, her body was buried in Carnide Cemetery, but on 20 February 2014 the Assembly of the Republic unanimously decided to honor the poet by entombing her remains in the Portuguese National Pantheon. The relocation ceremony took place on 2 July 2014.

== Writing style ==
From her childhood and youth, she emphasized the importance of houses, and memories that had a great impact on her work, describing and recalling the houses and the objects inside them. She explained this as follows: &quot;I have a lot of visual memory and I always remember houses, room by room, furniture by furniture, and I remember many houses that have disappeared from my life... I try to &#x27;represent&#x27;, I mean, &#x27;bring back the things I liked,&#x27; and that&#x27;s what goes with houses: I want their memory not to drift, not to be lost.&quot;Andresen also believed that poetry had a fundamental transformative value. Her writing corresponded to specific cycles, with the culmination of the activity at night: &quot;I cannot write in the morning... I need that special concentration that is being created at night.&quot; Her nightly experiences are underlined in several poems (&quot;Night&quot;, &quot;The Moonlight&quot;, &quot;The Garden and the Night&quot;, &quot;April Night&quot;, and &quot;O Night&quot;). She accepted the notion of inspired poetry, saying that her poetry happened to her, as it did with Fernando Pessoa: &quot;Fernando Pessoa said: &#x27;A poem has happened to me.&#x27; My fundamental writing is very close to this &#x27;happening&#x27;. I found poetry before I knew there was literature. I really thought that the poems were not written by anyone, that they existed in themselves, that they were like an element of the natural, that they were suspended immanent. It is difficult to describe the process of writing a poem. There is always a part that I can&#x27;t distinguish, a part that happens in the area where I don&#x27;t see it.&quot; According to Dulce Maria Quintela, Andresen&#x27;s life and memories are an inspiration because she &quot;speaks of herself through her poetry&quot;.

=== Early writings ===

Andresen began her love of poetry as a child when, at the age of three, she was taught &quot;A Nau Catrineta&quot; by her nanny Laura.There was a maid in my house named Laura, whom I liked very much. She was a young, blonde woman, very beautiful. Laura taught me &quot;A Nau Catrineta&quot; because there was an older cousin of mine who had been taught a poem to say at Christmas and she didn&#x27;t want me to be left behind… I was a phenomenon, reciting the entire &quot;Nau Catrineta&quot;. But there are more encounters, fundamental encounters with poetry: the recitation of the &quot;Magnífica&quot; on thunderstorms, for example. When we were a little older, we had a housekeeper who on those nights burned rosemary, lit a candle and prayed. It was a mixed environment of religion and magic… And in a way on those thunderstorms, many things were born. Even a certain social and human concern, or my first awareness of the harshness of the lives of others, because this housekeeper said: &quot;Now fishermen walk in the sea, let us pray that they will reach the land&quot; (...). &quot;Based on Luísa Pessoa&#x27;s observations, Andresen focuses on themes such as: childhood and youth, which she uses as a reference space (&quot;The Garden and the House&quot;, Poetry, 1944; &quot;House&quot;, Geography, 1967; &quot;White House&quot;, Poetry, 1944; &quot;Lost Garden&quot;, Poetry, Garden and the Night, Poetry, 1944).

=== Later work ===
Contact with nature also profoundly marked her work. For the author, this contact became an example of freedom, beauty, perfection and mystery and is widely found in her work, whether by the allusions to the land (trees, birds, moonlight) or by her references to the sea (beach, shells, waves).

The Sea is one of the key concepts in Andresen&#x27;s literary creations: &quot;From the Shore / Where It All Started Intact on the First Day of Me.&quot; The literary effect of the sea&#x27;s inspiration can be seen in several poems, such as &quot;Men by the Sea&quot; or &quot;Women by the Sea.&quot; The author comments on this inspiration as follows:&quot;These poems have to do with the Granja mornings, the beach mornings. And also with a painting by Picasso. There is a painting by Picasso called &quot;Women by the Sea.&quot; No one will say that Picasso&#x27;s painting and Lorca&#x27;s poetry have had a tremendous influence on my poetry, especially in the time of the Choral ... And one of Picasso&#x27;s influences on me was that I moved the images.&quot;The sea is used to express the obsession with it, its beauty, its serenity and its myths. The sea appears here as a symbol of the dynamics of life. Everything comes from it and everything returns to it. It is the space of life, transformation and death.

The city is another motif often repeated in Andresen&#x27;s work. The city is viewed as negative space. It represents the cold, artificial, hostile and dehumanized world, the opposite of nature and security.

Another frequently stressed topic in Andresen&#x27;s work is time: the divided and the absolute that oppose each other. The first is the time of loneliness, fear and lies, while absolute time is eternal, unites life and is the time of moral values. According to Eduardo do Prado Coelho, the divided time is the time of the house&#x27;s exile, associated with the city, because the city is also made by the twisting of time, the degradation.

Andresen was an admirer of classical literature. In her poems, words often appear of ancient spelling (Eurydice, Delphos, Amphora). The cult for the proper art and tradition of Greek civilization is close to her and shows through her work.

In addition to the thematic aspects mentioned above, Fernando Pessoa&#x27;s enormous influence on the work of Andresen is also present. What the two authors have in common is: Plato&#x27;s influence, the appeal to infinity, childhood memory, Sebastianism and Messianism and the formal tone that evokes Álvaro de Campos.

=== Themes ===
In general, the author&#x27;s thematic universe is comprehensive and can be represented by the following summary points:

* The pursuit of justice, balance, harmony and the demand for morality
* Awareness of the time we live
* Nature and the Sea - euphoric and referential spaces for any human being
* The theme of the house
* Love
* Life as opposed to death
* Childhood memory
* Values of classical antiquity, Hellenic naturalism
* Idealism and individualism at the psychological level
* The poet as shepherd of the absolute
* Christian humanism
* Belief in Messianic and Sebastianist Values
* Separation

Regarding Andresen&#x27;s language style, the most evident marks are: the hieratic value of the word, the rigorous expression, the appeal to the clarifying vision, richness of symbols and allegories, synesthesias and an evocative rhythm of a ritual dimension. One can also notice a &quot;transparency of the word in its relation of language to things, the luminosity of a world where intellect and rhythm harmonize in perfect, melodic form.&quot;

The opinion of her work shared by some of the most important Portuguese literary critics is the same: the author&#x27;s talent is unanimously appreciated. Eduardo Lourenço says that Andresen has a wisdom &quot;deeper than just knowing&quot;, that its intimate knowledge is immense and its reflection, however deep, is exposed in an original simplicity.

== Legacy ==
In the Lisbon Oceanarium, since 2005, some of Andresen&#x27;s poems with a strong connection to the sea have been placed for permanent reading in the rest areas, allowing visitors to absorb the boldness of her writing while immersed in a deep sea environment.

&quot;Poetry,&quot; she explained, &quot;is my understanding of the universe, my way of relating to things, my participation in reality, my encounter with voices and images. This is why a poem speaks not of an ideal life but of a concrete one: the angle of a window, the resonance of streets, cities and rooms, the shadow cast by a wall, a sudden face, the silence, distance and brightness of the stars, the night’s breath, the scent of linden and of oregano.&quot; The sea is probably the most central theme in her poetical works. Other recurring themes are Ancient Greece and ideas of freedom and justice.

Her poetry has been translated into English by Ruth Fainlight, Richard Zenith and most recently by Colin Rorrison with Margaret Jull Costa, as well as into many other world languages.

A documentary short film about Andresen was produced in 1969. It was the first completed film by director João César Monteiro (then using the name João César Santos).

<text>The Googleplex is the corporate headquarters complex of Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc. It is located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.

The original complex, with of office space, is the company&#x27;s second largest square footage assemblage of Google buildings, after Google&#x27;s 111 Eighth Avenue building in New York City, which the company bought in 2010.

&quot;Googleplex&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Google&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; (meaning a complex of buildings) and a reference to &quot;googolplex&quot;, the name given to the large number 1010100, or 10googol.

==Facilities and history==

===The original campus===
====SGI campus====
The site was previously occupied by Silicon Graphics (SGI). The office space and corporate campus is located within a larger site that contains Charleston Park, a public park; improved access to Permanente Creek; and public roads that connect the corporate site to Shoreline Park and the Bay Trail. The project, launched in 1994, was built on the site of one of the few working farms in the area and was city owned at the time (identified as &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Field&quot; in the planning documents). It was a creative collaboration between SGI, StUDIOS Architecture, SWA Group, and the Planning and Community Development Agency of the City of Mountain View, California. The objective was to develop in complementary fashion the privately owned corporate headquarters and adjoining public greenspace. Key design decisions placed parking for nearly 2000 cars underground, enabling SWA to integrate the two open spaces with water features, shallow pools, fountains, pathways, and plazas. The project was completed in 1997. The American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) noted that the SGI project was a significant departure from typical corporate campuses and which challenged conventional thinking about private and public space, and awarded the project the ASLA Centennial Medallion in 1999.
====Google campus====
The former SGI facilities were leased by Google beginning in 2003. A redesign of the interiors was completed by Clive Wilkinson Architects in 2005.
In June 2006, Google purchased some of Silicon Graphics&#x27;s properties, including the Googleplex, for $319 million.

Because the buildings are of relatively low height, the complex sprawls out over a large area of land. The interior of the headquarters is furnished with items like shade lamps and giant rubber balls and the lobby contains a piano and a projection of current live Google search queries. Facilities include free laundry rooms (Buildings 40, 42 &amp; CL3), two small swimming pools, multiple sand volleyball courts, a bowling alley, massage rooms, organic gardens, and eighteen cafeterias with diverse menus. Google installed replicas of SpaceShipOne and a dinosaur skeleton.

Since 2017, solar panels cover the rooftops of eight buildings and two solar carports, capable of producing 1.6 megawatts of electricity. At the time of installation, Google believed it to be the largest in the United States among corporations. The panels provide the power for 30% of the peak electricity demand in their solar-powered buildings.
Four 100kW Bloom Energy Servers were shipped to Google in July 2008, as the first customer of Bloom Energy.

The Android lawn statues were outside of Building 44 on Charleston Road, and were relocated on the Google campus at 1981 Landings Drive. They include a giant green statue of the Android logo and additional statues to represent all the versions of the Android operating system.

===Bay View addition===

In 2013, construction began on a new campus dubbed &quot;Bay View&quot;, adjoining the original campus on leased from the NASA Ames Research Center and overlooking San Francisco Bay at Moffett Federal Airfield. The estimated cost of the project was $120 million with a target opening date of 2015.

NBBJ was the architect and this was the first time Google has designed its own buildings.

The addition is off the northeast corner of the complex, by the Stevens Creek Nature Study Area and Shoreline Park. Before announcing the construction, Google, through its internal real estate firm, Planetary Ventures, sought permission from the City of Mountain View to build bridges over the adjacent Stevens Creek. Google&#x27;s 2012 year-end annual report noted it can develop only of the site.

Google planned in 2015 a addition designed by Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels in North Bayshore. The site, however, was granted to LinkedIn by the city councilors and the Google project was revised in 2016, with 3 buildings to be built on 2 different sites east of Googleplex in Mountain View: one immediately next to Googleplex, and the two smaller ones a few blocks away.

===Google Visitor Experience===
In September 2023, Google announced the Google Visitor Experience, a visitor center next to the Googleplex which occupies the building formerly known as Charleston East, and now known as Gradient Canopy. The visitor center includes a Google Store, a public plaza, a café, and public art, and opened on October 12, 2023.

==Location==
The Googleplex is located between Charleston Road, Amphitheatre Parkway, and Shoreline Boulevard in north Mountain View, California, close to the Shoreline Park wetlands. Employees living in San Francisco, the East Bay, or South Bay may take a free Wi-Fi-enabled Google shuttle to and from work. The shuttles are powered by a fuel blend of 95% petroleum diesel and 5% biodiesel and have the latest emissions reduction technology.

To the north lies the Shoreline Amphitheatre and Intuit, and to the south lies Microsoft&#x27;s Silicon Valley research complex, the Computer History Museum, and Century Theatres. Moffett Field is nearby to the east.

==Other Google Mountain View locations==
Google in its 2012-year-end annual report said it had 3.5 million square feet of office space in Mountain View.

Google has another large campus in Mountain View dubbed &quot;The Quad&quot; at 399 North Whisman Road about from the Googleplex.

In 2013, Google leased the entire Mayfield Mall, an enclosed shopping mall that last operated in 1984 and was leased by Hewlett-Packard from 1986 to 2002.

The semi-secret Google X Lab, which is the development lab for items such as Google Glass, is located in &quot;ordinary two-story red-brick buildings&quot; about from the Googleplex. It has a &quot;burbling fountain out front and rows of company-issued bikes, which employees use to shuttle to the main campus.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The Googleplex is featured in the 2013 film &quot;The Internship&quot;, with the Georgia Tech campus standing in as a double, because Google disallows filming on the campus grounds for privacy reasons. It was the inspiration for the fictional Hooli headquarters in the HBO TV series &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

<doc id="773425" wikidata="Q475346" url="?curid=773425" title="Deuteronomist">
<text>The Deuteronomist, abbreviated as either Dtr or simply D, may refer either to the source document underlying the core chapters (12–26) of the Book of Deuteronomy, or to the broader &quot;school&quot; that produced all of Deuteronomy as well as the Deuteronomistic history of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and also the Book of Jeremiah. The adjectives &quot;Deuteronomic&quot; and &quot;Deuteronomistic&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably; if they are distinguished, then the first refers to the core of Deuteronomy and the second to all of Deuteronomy and the history.

The Deuteronomist is one of the sources identified through source criticism as underlying much of the Hebrew Bible. Among source-critical scholars, it is generally agreed that the Deuteronomistic history originated independently of the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers (based on the Priestly source and the Jahwist), and independently of the historical Books of Chronicles. Most scholars trace all or most of Deuteronomistic history to the Babylonian captivity (6th century BCE), and associate it with editorial reworking of both the Tetrateuch and Jeremiah.

==Background==
Since the mid-20th century, scholars have imagined the Deuteronomists as country Levites, a junior order of priests, or as prophets in the tradition of the northern Kingdom of Israel, or as sages and scribes at the royal court. Recent scholarship has interpreted the book as involving all these groups, and the origin and growth of Deuteronomism is usually described in the following terms:
* Following the destruction of Israel by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722 BCE, refugees came south to Judah, bringing with them traditions, notably the concept of Yahweh as the only God who should be served, which had not previously been known. Among those influenced by these new ideas were the landowning aristocrats (called am ha&#x27;aretz &quot;people of the land&quot; in the Bible), who provided the administrative elite in Jerusalem.
* In 640 BCE, there was a crisis when King Amon of Judah was murdered. The aristocrats suppressed the attempted coup, putting the ringleaders to death and placing Amon&#x27;s eight-year-old son Josiah on the throne.
* Judah at this time was a vassal state of Assyria, but Assyria now began a rapid and unexpected decline in power, leading to a resurgence of nationalism in Jerusalem. In 622, Josiah launched his reform program, based on an early form of Deuteronomy 5–26, framed as a covenant (treaty) between Judah and Yahweh in which Yahweh replaced the Assyrian king.
* By the end of the 7th century, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had replaced the Assyrians. The trauma of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586, and the Babylonian captivity that followed led to much theological reflection on the meaning of the tragedy and the Deuteronomistic history was written as an explanation: Israel had been unfaithful to Yahweh, and the exile was God&#x27;s punishment.
* By about 540, Babylonia was rapidly declining as the next rising power, the Achaemenid Empire, steadily destroyed it. With the end of the Babylonian oppression becoming ever more probable, Deuteronomy was given a new introduction and attached to the history books as an overall theological introduction.
* The final stage was the addition of a few extra laws following the Fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire in 539 and the return of some (in fact only a small fraction) of the exiles to Jerusalem.

==Deuteronomistic works==
===Deuteronomy===

Deuteronomy was formed by a complex process that reached probably from the 7th century BCE to the early 5th. It consists of a historical prologue; an introduction; the Deuteronomic Code followed by blessings and curses; and a conclusion.

The book&#x27;s core is the law code (chapters 12–26). 2 Kings 22–23 tells how a &quot;Book of the Law,&quot; commonly identified with the law code, was found in the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of Josiah. According to the story in 2 Kings, reading the book caused Josiah to embark on a series of religious reforms, and it has been suggested that it was written to validate this program. Notwithstanding, it is generally accepted that at least some of the laws are much earlier than Josiah.

The introduction to the code (chapters 4:44–11:32) was added during Josiah&#x27;s time, thus creating the earliest version of Deuteronomy as a book, and the historical prologue (chapters 1–4:43) was added still later to turn Deuteronomy into an introduction to the entire Deuteronomistic history (Deuteronomy to Kings).

===Deuteronomistic history===

The term was coined in 1943 by the German biblical scholar Martin Noth to explain the origin and purpose of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. These, he argued, were the work of a single 6th-century BCE author/compiler seeking to explain recent events (the fall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile) using the theology and language of the Book of Deuteronomy. The author used his sources with a heavy hand, depicting Joshua as a grand, divinely guided conquest, Judges as a cycle of rebellion and salvation, and the story of the kings as recurring disaster due to disobedience to God.

A series of studies that modified Noth&#x27;s original concept began in the late 1960s. In 1968, Frank Moore Cross made an important revision, suggesting that the history was first written in the late 7th century BCE as a contribution to King Josiah of Judah&#x27;s program of reform (the Dtr1 version), and only later revised and updated by Noth&#x27;s 6th-century author (Dtr2). Dtr1 saw Israel&#x27;s history as a contrast between God&#x27;s judgment on the sinful northern Kingdom of Israel of Jeroboam I, who set up golden calves to be worshiped in Bethel and Dan, and virtuous Judah, where faithful king David had reigned and where now the righteous Josiah was reforming the kingdom. The exilic Dtr2 supplemented Dtr1&#x27;s history with warnings of a broken covenant, an inevitable punishment and exile for the sinful (in Dtr2&#x27;s view) Kingdom of Judah.

Cross&#x27;s &quot;dual redaction&quot; model is probably the most widely accepted, but a considerable number of European scholars prefer an alternative model put forward by Rudolf Smend and his pupils. This approach holds that Noth was right to locate the composition of the history in the 6th century, but that further redactions took place after the initial composition, including a &quot;nomistic&quot; (from the Greek word for &quot;law&quot;), or DtrN, layer, and a further layer concerned with the prophets, abbreviated as DtrP.

For a time, the Deuteronomistic history enjoyed &quot;canonical&quot; status in biblical studies. However, writing in 2000, Gary N. Knoppers noted that &quot;in the last five years an increasing number of commentators have expressed grave doubts about fundamental tenets of Noth&#x27;s classic study.&quot;

===Jeremiah and the prophetic literature===
The prose sermons in the Book of Jeremiah are written in a style and outlook closely akin to, yet different from, the Deuteronomistic history. Scholars differ over how much of the book is from Jeremiah himself and how much from later disciples, but the Swiss scholar Thomas Römer has recently identified two Deuteronomistic &quot;redactions&quot; (editings) of the Book of Jeremiah occurring some time before the end of the Exile (pre-539 BCE) – a process which also involved the prophetic books of Amos and Hosea. The biblical text records about the &quot;authors&quot; of the Deuteronomistic works that Jeremiah the prophet used scribes such as Baruch to accomplish his ends. It is also noteworthy that the Deuteronomistic History never mentions Jeremiah and some scholars believe that the &quot;Jeremiah&quot; Deuteronomists represent a distinct party from the &quot;DtrH&quot; Deuteronomists, with opposing agendas.

==Deuteronomism (Deuteronomistic theology)==
Deuteronomy is conceived of as a covenant (a treaty) between the Israelites and Yahweh, who has chosen (&quot;elected&quot;) the Israelites as his people and requires them to live according to his law. Israel is to be a theocracy with Yahweh as the divine suzerain. The law is to be supreme over all other sources of authority, including kings and royal officials, and the scribes (Sanhedrin) are the guardians of the law: prophecy is instruction in the law as given through Moses, the law given through Moses is the complete and sufficient revelation of the Will of God, and nothing further is needed.

Under the covenant, Yahweh promised the Israelites the land of Canaan, but the promise was conditional: they would lose the land if they were unfaithful. The Deuteronomistic history explains successes and failures as the result of faithfulness, which brings success, or disobedience, which brings failure; the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 721 BCE and the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians in 586 BCE are Yahweh&#x27;s punishment for continued sinfulness.

Deuteronomy insists on the centralisation of worship &quot;in the place that the Lord your God will choose&quot;; Deuteronomy never says where this place will be, but Kings makes it clear that it is Jerusalem.

It also shows a special concern for the poor, widows and the fatherless: all Israelites are brothers and sisters, and each will answer to God for his treatment of his neighbour. This concern for equality and humanity extends also to the stranger who lives among the Israelites. The stranger is often mentioned in tandem with the concern for the widow and the orphan. Furthermore, there is a specific commandment to love the stranger.

<text>The 8th World Championships in Athletics, under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations, were held at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada between 3 and 12 August 2001 and was the first time the event had visited North America. The music for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies was composed by Canadian composers Jan Randall and Cassius Khan. The ceremonies also featured a thousand-strong voice choir, and the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

Edmonton defeated bids from Paris, France (which hosted the next edition) and the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States to host the event. Edmonton had previously hosted the 1978 Commonwealth Games and the 1983 Summer Universiade.

<text>In welfare economics, a social planner is a hypothetical decision-maker who attempts to maximize some notion of social welfare. The planner is a fictional entity who chooses allocations for every agent in the economy—for example, levels of consumption and leisure—that maximize a social welfare function subject to certain constraints (e.g., a physical resource constraint, or incentive compatibility constraints). This so-called planner&#x27;s problem is a mathematical constrained optimization problem. Solving the planner&#x27;s problem for all possible Pareto weights (i.e., weights on each type of agent in the economy) yields all Pareto efficient allocations.

== Connection with the fundamental welfare theorems ==
Any Pareto efficient allocation is a solution to a planner&#x27;s problem. However, the planner is a purely fictional entity; solving the planner&#x27;s problem requires knowledge of consumers&#x27; preferences and all physical resource constraints in the economy. Thus, a natural question is whether a decentralized market could implement a Pareto efficient allocation, or conversely, whether the outcomes from a decentralized market are Pareto efficient. The fundamental theorems of welfare economics answer these questions, under certain key assumptions.

The first welfare theorem states that, under certain conditions (for example, if there are no externalities), if an allocation and a set of prices constitute a competitive equilibrium, then the allocation is Pareto efficient.

The second welfare theorem states that, under certain conditions, any Pareto efficient allocation can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium.

<doc id="773438" wikidata="Q7250385" url="?curid=773438" title="Proposed Melbourne rail extensions">
<text>Proposals for expansion of the Melbourne rail network are commonly presented by political parties, government agencies, industry organisations and public transport advocacy groups. The extensions proposed take a variety of forms: electrification of existing routes to incorporate them into the suburban rail system; reconstruction of former passenger rail lines along pre-existing easements; entirely new routes intended to serve new areas with heavy rail or provide alternative routes in congested areas; or track amplification along existing routes to provide segregation of services. Other proposals are for the construction of new or relocated stations on existing lines, to provide improved access to public transport services.

Proposals which have been adopted as policy by the state government, and which are in the detailed planning or construction phases, are also listed in this article.

== History ==

=== 1929 Metropolitan Town Planning Commission Plan ===

The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission, established in 1922 by the Victorian state government, produced a report in 1929 that recommended a new underground railway in central Melbourne running via Exhibition and Victoria streets to reduce congestion at Flinders Street station. The plan also proposed:

* A rail loop in Fishermans Bend
* A rail line to Doncaster via tunnel beneath Kew and Kew East
* A rail extension from Malvern East to Glen Waverley
* A bridge connecting Spencer Street station and the Port Melbourne and St Kilda lines

=== 1940 Ashworth Improvement Plan ===
A 1940 report by the Victorian Railways Chief Engineer for Ways and Works recommended a number of rail improvement works, including an underground city railway, a line to Doncaster via the Kew spur, and the connection of the Alamein line to the Glen Waverley line at Malvern East.

=== 1954 Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme Report ===
A 1954 strategy released by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works recommended changes to Melbourne&#x27;s land-use planning, an extensive network of freeways and a park system. It also recommended some expansions to the rail network, including an underground CBD rail line with three stations beneath Lonsdale Street. It also called for:

* A new rail loop in the industrial Fishermans Bend precinct with seven new stations to transport workers
* A new north–south rail link and bridge connecting Spencer Street station (now named Southern Cross) with the Port Melbourne line, with a new station in Southbank 
* A branch of the Hurstbridge line from Alphington to East Preston to serve Northcote, Preston and Heidelberg, running alongside Darebin Creek
* A branch of the Frankston line between Moorabbin and Highett stations to beachside suburb Beaumaris
* A new Mornington railway line from Frankston to Mornington via Mount Eliza

The report recommended against a line to Doncaster due to the high cost of tunnelling.

=== 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan ===

A major plan released by the Victorian state government of Henry Bolte called for the creation of 510 kilometres of freeways, and a number of new rail lines. The plan proposed:

* An underground rail loop in central Melbourne
* A line to Doncaster connecting with the network at Victoria Park station
* A line to Monash University Clayton
* An extension from Altona to Westona
* An extension from Huntingdale to Ferntree Gully 
* A new line connecting Dandenong and Frankston
* Several extensions of suburban electric service along existing lines to Werribee, Rockbank, Sunbury, Craigieburn, Coldstream, Hastings and Mornington

None of these proposed lines were ever built, except for the underground rail loop which began construction in 1971 and progressively opened between 1981 and 1985. The lines to Werribee, Sunbury and Craigieburn were also eventually electrified.

=== 1999 Linking Victoria ===

A strategy launched in 1999 by the state government of Steve Bracks called for an airport rail link to Melbourne Airport and the reopening of several regional railway lines.

=== 2008 Victorian Transport Plan ===

The government of John Brumby responded to a major increase in rail patronage by releasing a plan in 2008 that called for a number of rail extensions, including the Regional Rail Link from west of Werribee to Southern Cross station, a new inner-city rail tunnel called the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, and electrification of the rail network to South Morang (completed in 2011), Sunbury (completed in 2012), Melton and Cranbourne East.

=== 2013 Network Development Plan: Metropolitan Rail (NDPMR) ===

New government agency Public Transport Victoria (PTV) released a detailed 20-year rail development plan in 2013 under the government of Denis Napthine. The report outlined a major expansion of the metropolitan rail network in Melbourne over a number of stages, with the goals of introducing a &#x27;metro-style system&#x27; and extending the reach of the network. Significant projects identified for construction included the Metro Tunnel, the Airport rail link, a line to Doncaster, a line to Rowville, a second underground inner-city rail tunnel, and many rail electrification and duplication projects.

== Extensions under construction ==
=== Metro Tunnel ===

There have been numerous proposals for a north–south tunnel in inner-city Melbourne, to relieve capacity on Melbourne&#x27;s City Loop and to provide new underground stations. In 2015 the State Government established the Melbourne Metro Rail Authority to oversee planning for new twin 9-kilometre rail tunnels through the central city between South Kensington station and South Yarra. The new Metro Tunnel will have five new underground stations and connect the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines with the Sunbury line, creating a new route through the CBD as an alternative to the City Loop. New underground stations will be created at Arden, Parkville, Domain and two new CBD stations, State Library and Town Hall. Enabling works were underway by 2016 and major construction work on the tunnel and stations began in 2017. The project has an estimated cost of $11 billion and is scheduled to be complete by 2025.

=== Airport rail link ===

A rail link to Melbourne Airport has been proposed repeatedly since the airport&#x27;s construction, with a variety of routes and service models suggested, but construction has never commenced. In July 2018, the Federal and State Governments each pledged A$5 billion (for a total of A$10 billion) to construct a rail link. The Federal Government proposed four preferred routes for the link, with one proposal running via a direct tunnel to Highpoint Shopping Centre and the others linking to existing stations in Broadmeadows, Flemington or Sunshine. An assessment of the four preferred routes conducted by Rail Projects Victoria culminated in the route via Sunshine station being selected, with a detailed business case expected by 2020. Construction began in 2022, but paused in May 2023 due to a Federal government review of major infrastructure projects. 

On the 8th of July 2024, Melbourne Airport ended longstanding negotiations with the Victorian Government over the stations location following the appointment of a mediator. Melbourne Airport have agreed to have the station above ground, with a hope to resume discussions to finalise the station&#x27;s design, the construction timeline and redress for the land required for the above-ground option, with a new targeted opening of 2033.

=== Suburban Rail Loop ===

In August 2018, in the run-up to the 2018 Victorian state election, the State Government pledged $300 million to complete a business case and secure funding to construct a new railway through suburban Melbourne. The project is designed to link major activity centres and amenities such as hospitals, shopping centres, universities, and Melbourne Airport. The proposal would connect most existing railway lines through middle suburbs and enable easier intra-suburban travel.

The Suburban Rail Loop (SRL) would connect the existing station at Cheltenham with other existing stations at Clayton, Glen Waverley, Box Hill, Heidelberg, Reservoir, Fawkner, Broadmeadows, Sunshine and Werribee. It will also link to new stations to be built in areas that have long been promised rail connections, including Monash University, Burwood, Doncaster, Bundoora and Melbourne Airport. Construction on the first stage, SRL East, began in 2022 and is set to open by 2035.

== Currently planned extensions ==

=== Electrification to Melton and Wyndham Vale ===

Electrification of the Deer Park – West Werribee line to Wyndham Vale was included in the 2013 Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail (NDPMR) by the government agency Public Transport Victoria, along with quadruplication to provide express tracks for Geelong services. The plan also called for the electrification of the Ballarat line as far as Melton. Several additional stations have been proposed for an electrified Wyndham Vale line, at locations including Truganina, Sayers Road, Davis Road and Black Forest Road.

During the 2018 Victorian state election, the State Government announced its Western Rail Plan, which would quadruplicate and electrify the rail lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale, allowing Metro services. Under this plan, Metro and V/Line regional services would be separated, allowing for higher speed trains to be introduced to Geelong and Ballarat. The plan would electrify the track to Wyndham Vale opened in 2015 as part of the Regional Rail Link. New tracks between Sunshine and Southern Cross Station to be built as part of the Airport rail link could add extra capacity for metro and regional trains. Planning for faster regional rail and electrification of the lines to Melton and Wyndham Vale will occur alongside planning for the Airport rail link, with construction set to start by 2022.

=== Extension to Clyde ===
Various proposals have been made to extend the Cranbourne line to the growth suburb of Clyde by rebuilding part of the closed South Gippsland line. Construction on a project to duplicate the Cranbourne line between Dandenong and Cranbourne began in 2020, with an extension to Clyde to follow on its completion. In September 2019 the State Government announced the timeline for duplication as part of a $1bn package named the &quot;Cranbourne Line Upgrade&quot;. The package includes the removal of the four remaining level crossing on the line, the duplication of 8 km of track, and the rebuilding of Merinda Park Station. The project began in 2020, with duplication completed in 2022 and the level crossing removals planned to be completed by 2024, allowing a ten minutes service frequency to Cranbourne and facilitating an eventual extension to Clyde.

== Other proposals ==

=== Melbourne Metro 2 ===

There have been various proposals for a successor to the Metro Tunnel, with the main proposal linking the Mernda and Werribee lines via a new tunnel between Clifton Hill and Newport. This proposal was first identified by PTV in the 2013 NDPMR. The new Parkville station to be built as part of the Metro Tunnel has been designed with provision for future expansion to an interchange with the second Metro Tunnel. Melbourne City Council has advocated for the tunnel, which could include stations at Fitzroy, Parkville, Flagstaff, Southern Cross and multiple stations at the urban renewal precinct Fishermans Bend. The tunnel was included in 2018 as part of the State Government&#x27;s 30-year strategy for Fisherman&#x27;s Bend, with two stations in the precinct, and has been backed by the independent planning agency Infrastructure Victoria in its 30-year infrastructure plan for the state released in 2021.

=== Melbourne Metro 3 ===
In 2018, a paper released by Melbourne City Council as part of its Transport Strategy refresh called for a third cross-city rail tunnel to be built by 2035. The council called for a stand-alone metro line running from Melbourne Airport to Maribyrnong, Arden Macaulay, Southern Cross, Parliament then east of the CBD to Richmond, Kew, Doncaster and Ringwood.

=== Western suburbs ===
==== Werribee line ====

*Extension of the Werribee line to meet the Deer Park – West Werribee line at Wyndham Vale was proposed in the 2013 NDPMR. The concept was later included in plans for the Suburban Rail Loop.
*Additional stations have been proposed for the Werribee line at Derrimut Road and Werribee South.

==== Avalon Airport ====
* Prior to the 2010 Victorian state election, then-Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu promised to begin construction in his first term on an extension of the passenger rail line to Avalon Airport in Melbourne&#x27;s South-West. The plan would have seen a single-line track branch off from the Melbourne-Geelong rail line. Despite the Napthine Government revealing a preferred option for the link in 2014, the proposal never progressed to construction. In 2018, Geelong Council called for a link to Avalon Airport as part of a future high-speed rail line to Geelong.
* Avalon Airport management acknowledge that current patronage cannot justify a rail branch to the airport. Their preference now is for an &quot;Avalon Airport&quot; station to be provided on the existing Melbourne to Geelong rail line, from which passengers would be transported, using an unspecified type of people mover, on the four-kilometre journey to the airport terminal. This would be using the corridor set aside for the airport rail branch. The project was likened to London Luton DART which is an automated people mover that connects the closest station (Luton Airport Parkway) over a 2.1km distance to the airport.

=== Northern suburbs ===
==== Albion–Jacana line ====

*In 2008, the Greens proposed standalone electrification of the Albion-Jacana railway line, with new passenger stations at Sunshine North, Keilor East, Westfield Shoppingtown, Airport West and Gowanbrae.

==== Craigieburn line ====

*The 2013 PTV NDPMR proposed electrification of the Craigieburn line as far as Wallan.

==== Upfield line ====

*The construction of a branch line was proposed between Flemington Bridge Station and Pascoe Vale Station in the early 1890s as a means of reducing Melbourne&#x27;s rising unemployment rate. Three stations were planned, tentatively named Bent Town, Munroville and La Rose.
*A spur line branching from the Upfield line along the former Inner Circle rail easement to Princes Park, was proposed by the Public Transport Users Association in 1991, primarily as a means of transporting sports fans to the football ground.
*The PTV NDPMR proposed re-activating the former connection between Upfield and the Craigieburn line at Somerton. Such a project, in conjunction with duplication of the Upfield line, would enable diversion of Seymour and Shepparton services away from the at-capacity Craigieburn line, and provide additional capacity for electrification to Wallan. A business case is expected to be complete in 2019.

=== North-eastern suburbs ===
==== Doncaster line ====

*A variety of proposals for railway lines to the suburb of Doncaster have been made since the mid-20th century, although none have commenced construction. The City of Manningham is the only metropolitan Melbourne council area not served by a heavy rail line, and most proposals have envisaged a junction with the Hurstbridge and Mernda lines near Clifton Hill. Public transport advocates have claimed that the most frequently proposed route, along the median of the Eastern Freeway, will be jeopardised by construction of the North East Link, permanently precluding construction of the rail line. However, construction authorities have stated that the reservation will continue to be suitable.

==== Hurstbridge line ====

*An extension of the Hurstbridge line to East Reservoir, was proposed in the 1950s as a means of opening up the area east of High Street towards Darebin Creek for residential development. The proposed route was a branch line from Alphington station to East Reservoir. The proposed line consisted of five stations and several bridges which meant that the line would not interfere with any road traffic. The proposed cost was approximately £250,000.
*A new Eltham North station, between the existing Eltham and Diamond Creek stations, has been proposed to provide improved access for local residents. However, the proposal has been criticised due to its potential to encourage urban sprawl in undeveloped areas.

=== Eastern suburbs ===
==== Lilydale line ====

*Extension of the Lilydale line to Coldstream station by re-electrifying part of the closed Healesville line was first proposed in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan. Yarra Ranges Council provided for a new station and stabling yard in Coldstream with its 2015 precinct structure plan, but cited advice from PTV that the extension was unlikely to occur. The reservation has now been used for the Yarra Valley trail, which connects Lilydale to Yering Station along the old rail corridor.
*An additional station at Cave Hill, between Mooroolbark and Lilydale, has been proposed by Yarra Ranges Council to support residential development in the area.

==== Rowville ====

*A railway line to the suburb of Rowville has been proposed repeatedly since its appearance in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, and was included in the PTV Network Development Plan. A 2012 feasibility study and a 2016 Infrastructure Victoria report rejected the project as a poor use of funds, but public transport advocates continue to favour a heavy rail line, particularly to serve the nearby Monash University campus. In 2018 the State Government instead proposed a light rail service along the route. It was expected to have a business case complete by 2019, though that year local councils expressed concern the project had stalled.

==== Knox ====

* In their 2018 Melbourne Rail Plan, the Rail Futures Institute proposed an underground extension of the Glen Waverley line to Knox City in Wantirna South.

==== Alamein line ====

*The 1940 Ashworth Improvement Plan identified future works to extend the Alamein line to East Malvern.
*Extending the Alamein line to Oakleigh, along the old Outer Circle line reservation, primarily to serve Chadstone Shopping Centre.

=== South-eastern suburbs ===

==== South-East Fast Line ====

* In their 2018 Melbourne Rail Plan, the Rail Futures Institute proposed that by 2035 a new express line should be built from Southern Cross to Caulfield, Chadstone, Monash, Dandenong and Pakenham, with new stations at Chadstone and Monash.

==== Frankston and Stony Point line ====

*Beaumaris railway line, a 1954 report by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works proposed a branch line from Moorabbin to Beaumaris, which included four stations, including stations at Bay Road and Cheltenham Road.
*Extending the Frankston line to Hastings or Baxter by electrifying part of the Stony Point line has been proposed to different extents at different times. A business case for electrification to Baxter is due for completion in 2019.

==== Electrification to Baxter ====
In 2019, the State Government completed a business case for electrification and extension of the Frankston line to Baxter station in Melbourne&#x27;s south, due for completion in 2019. In November 2019 the business case was delivered to the Federal Government. The plan included electrification of the line with two stations, Baxter and Leawarra station near Monash University Peninsula Campus. The business case included other enhancements, such as track duplication, level crossing removals, station upgrades, car parking and train stabling. The Federal Government committed $225 million towards the project in its 2017-2018 budget. However due to the federal government review regarding spending on major infrastructure projects, in November 2023 it was announced that project funding was subsequently axed.

==== Pakenham and Cranbourne line ====

*The Public Transport Users&#x27; Association has proposed re-opening the General Motors railway station which closed in July 2002. Both platforms and the footbridge above the station remain but would require repairs and resurfacing or replacement, while the building and other fixtures would have to be demolished and new facilities built. PTV instead argues that land use in the area does not demand construction of a passenger station.

=== Southern suburbs ===

==== St Kilda line ====
Although the St Kilda Line has been converted to light rail operation and is now part of Melbourne&#x27;s tram network, several proposals for rail extensions existed throughout its working life.
* Various proposals have existed to extend the St Kilda line to Elwood.
**In 1857, a proposal was brought forward to bring the Gippsland Railway into Melbourne via Elsternwick, Elwood and St Kilda.
** In 1882, an Albert Park to Elwood Railway was listed on that year&#x27;s Railway Construction Bill. Despite public support, the Elwood line was later deleted as it was felt that the area was already well served by public transport.
** During 1884, William Ross developed plans to extend the St Kilda line to his Rosstown Railway via Elwood. Two routes, a Sea Beach and inland Melbourne Extension were proposed.
** The 1940 Ashworth Improvement Plan identified future works to extend the St Kilda south easterly to Elwood. These included a tunnel under Fitzroy Street and 3 stations.
* In 1954 the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Board of Works released their Planning Scheme for Melbourne which contained a new station on Southbank and a direct route to Spencer Street station.
* In 1970, the Tewksbury Symposium, a group of Melbourne University academics, proposed a &quot;by-pass&quot; line from the Glen Waverley railway via Caulfield and Elsternwick, to link up with the St Kilda line. The proposal was framed as part of an alternative scheme to the Melbourne Underground Loop.

<doc id="773446" wikidata="Q2166634" url="?curid=773446" title="The Pop Group">
<text>The Pop Group are an English rock band formed in Bristol in 1977 by vocalist Mark Stewart, guitarist John Waddington, bassist Simon Underwood, guitarist/saxophonist Gareth Sager, and drummer Bruce Smith. Their work in the late 1970s crossed diverse musical influences including punk, dub, funk, and free jazz with radical politics, helping to pioneer post-punk music.

The group released two albums, &quot;Y&quot; (1979) and &quot;For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?&quot; (1980), and singles such as &quot;She Is Beyond Good and Evil&quot; and &quot;We Are All Prostitutes&quot; (both 1979), then split in 1981. Its members worked on a variety of subsequent projects, including New Age Steppers and Rip Rig + Panic. In 2010, the band reunited, touring and releasing new material as well as reissuing their back catalogue on Freaks R Us. Stewart and Waddington both died in 2023.

==History==
===Original run (1977–1981)===
The Pop Group was formed in 1977 in Bristol when teenager Mark Stewart set out to start a funk group with schoolmates John Waddington and Simon Underwood. Inspired by the energy of punk rock but feeling the style to be too conservative, the group drew influence from the avant-garde, black music styles such as free jazz and dub, and radical political traditions. Guitarist Gareth Sager and drummer Bruce Smith were eventually added to the group. Soon after forming, they began to gain notoriety for their live performances and were signed to Radar Records. They appeared on the cover of the &quot;NME&quot;. The band donated the proceeds from their first high-profile tour to Amnesty International. They issued their debut single &quot;She Is Beyond Good and Evil&quot; in March 1979 and their debut album &quot;Y&quot; in April of that year, both to acclaim. Regardless, their moderate success was sufficient to convince Rough Trade to sign the band. During this period, Dan Catsis replaced Underwood on bass.

The band&#x27;s career with Rough Trade began with the release of the single &quot;We Are All Prostitutes.&quot; This was followed by the release of their second album &quot;For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?&quot; (1980). Shortly afterwards the Pop Group released a split single, &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will...&quot;, with the Slits, a band with whom they shared a drummer (Bruce Smith) and manager Dick O&#x27;Dell. The band&#x27;s last live performance was in 1980 to a crowd of 500,000 people at Trafalgar Square as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament protest. They split in 1981 after legal wranglings and internal disagreements. Members of the group collaborated and joined bands such as Pigbag, Maximum Joy, Head, the Slits and Rip Rig + Panic, the latter notable for the involvement of Neneh Cherry. Stewart subsequently embarked on a solo career and went on to collaborate with Adrian Sherwood and On-U Sound, prior to a series of albums on Mute Records.

===Reformation (2010–present)===
In 2010, The Pop Group reunited for a special edition of ATP festival curated by Simpsons creator Matt Groening, with members Mark Stewart, Gareth Sager, Bruce Smith and Dan Catsis. Over the next few years the band engaged in a prolific series of releases on the label Freaks R Us. The 1980 LP &quot;We Are Time&quot; was reissued worldwide on 20 October 2014, and the band released a compilation of rarities titled &quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;. In support of the reissues, the band undertook a seven-day tour of the UK, and in February 2015, released &quot;Citizen Zombie&quot;, their first studio album in 35 years. They then went on a worldwide tour with dates in the U.S., Japan, and Australia, followed by an extensive European tour culminating in festival appearances, including two live sets at Glastonbury.

In February 2016 &quot;For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?&quot; was rereleased on CD and released digitally for the first time. This was accompanied by the release of a colour vinyl edition of &quot;We Are All Prostitutes,&quot; referred to by &quot;The Vinyl Factory&quot;. A previously unseen video for &quot;We Are All Prostitutes&quot;, shot at the Electric Ballroom in November 1979 but thought to be lost, was recovered from the attic of video artist Chris Reynolds and unveiled. In May, the band released a collection of live recordings titled &quot;The Boys Whose Head Exploded&quot;. Throughout 2016, the band worked on new material with producer Dennis Bovell, and in October &quot;Honeymoon on Mars&quot; was released. In 2019, the band&#x27;s debut album Y, produced by Dennis Bovell, was reissued by Mute Records with unreleased live and studio recordings. This was followed by Y in Dub in 2021, a new dub-focused interpretation of the album, once again produced by Dennis Bovell.

On 21 April 2023, Mark Stewart died at the age of 62.

John Waddington&#x27;s death was announced on 21 June 2023. He was 63.

==Style and influences==
The Pop Group have been called pioneers of the late-1970s post-punk movement. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the Pop Group &quot;almost singlehandedly effected the transition from punk to post-punk,&quot; noting that they &quot;– ahead of Gang of Four, PiL, A Certain Ratio and the rest – steered punk towards a radical, politicised mash-up of dub, funk, free jazz and the avant-garde.&quot; Louder Than War called them &quot;one of the most wildly innovative and barrier-shattering bands to emerge from the late ’70s post-punk era.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the group as &quot;an explosive mutant gene,&quot; asserting that &quot;among their rabble-rousing post-punk contemporaries, none boasted as much sheer musical inventiveness and audacity.&quot; Theorist Mark Fisher described their sound as &quot;both cavernous and propulsive, ultra-abstract yet driven by dance music’s physical imperatives.&quot;

The group was inspired by diverse musical sources as diverse as Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, Captain Beefheart, King Tubby, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, Sun Ra, John Cage, Debussy, Neu!, Funkadelic, Television, the New York Dolls, Jacques Brel, The Who, Subway Sect and Steve Reich in addition to non-musical sources such as French romanticism, Antonin Artaud, Beat poetry, Comte de Lautréamont, Jean Baudrillard, the Situationists, and existential philosophy. Addressing the group&#x27;s shift toward an agitprop sensibility on their second album, released during the rise of Thatcherism, Mark Fisher wrote that the group&#x27;s goal was &quot;emotional engineering, a jolting out of the ideological trance that accepts injustice as inevitable.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
Their music inspired and influenced many bands and artists that followed them. They are cited as an influence by artists and bands like Minutemen, Primal Scream, Sonic Youth, Steve Albini of Big Black, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and Massive Attack. 

The Australian artist Nick Cave attended a gig of the Pop Group and was so inspired by their performance, he stated that: &quot;...It was one of those moments we just feel the cogs of your mind shift and your life is going to be irreversibly changed forever.&quot;

David J of Bauhaus named the group as one of the &quot;few bands on the [post-punk] scene at the time to whom we related&quot;.

American artist St. Vincent performed a cover of &quot;She Is Beyond Good And Evil&quot; on &quot;Late Night With Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The song also was a regular on her Strange Mercy Tour.

Outside of music, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, is a fan of the band and instigated their return when he invited them to reform for All Tomorrow’s Parties in 2010.

<text>The Argentina national rugby union team (Spanish: &quot;Selección de rugby de Argentina&quot;) represents Argentina in men&#x27;s international competitions, The Argentine Rugby Union (). Officially nicknamed Los Pumas, they play in sky blue and white jerseys. They are ranked 5th in the world by World Rugby, making them by some distance the highest-ranked nation in the Americas.

Argentina played its first international rugby match in 1910 against a touring British Isles team. Argentina has competed at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament of 1987 and are considered by far the strongest team within the Americas, being undefeated against all but Canada, against whom they have suffered two losses.

The Pumas&#x27; impressive results since the 1999 World Cup have seen rugby&#x27;s popularity in Argentina grow significantly. They have achieved several upset victories and are capable of regularly defeating Six Nations sides. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Argentina were undefeated in their pool and reached the semi-finals for the first time; they were defeated by South Africa in the semi-finals, but followed up with a win over France to claim third place overall. By the end of the competition, the team had reached an all-time high of third in the World Rankings.

After their advances in competitiveness and performance during the 2000s, coupled with their location in the Southern Hemisphere, Argentina was the only tier 1 nation that had no regular competition. Argentina officially joined The Rugby Championship on 23 November 2011. In their first tournament in 2012, Argentina secured a 16–16 draw with The Springboks in only their second game.

The 2014 Rugby Championship saw the first Championship-match win for Argentina who defeated Australia 21–17. 2015 proved to be a successful year for Argentine rugby, including their first ever win over South Africa in the Rugby Championship, and they reached another semi-final at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In the 2016 Rugby Championship, the Pumas again defeated the Springboks. Although winless during the 2017 Rugby Championship, the Pumas achieved two wins in their 2018 campaign, defeating both South Africa and Australia. On 14 November 2020, the Pumas beat New Zealand 25–15 to record their first win over the All Blacks, and on August 27, 2022, they defeated the All Blacks for the first time in New Zealand. The wins against New Zealand meant that Los Pumas had finally won a match against every major Rugby union team. In the 2024 Rugby Championship, the Pumas first achieved wins against all three rivals in the same year, including a win against number one ranked South Africa...

==History==
The History of the Argentina national team starts with the first international played by an Argentine side against the British Isles in 1910 when they toured on South America. Argentina gained recognition in 1965, when the team toured South Africa playing a series of friendly matches there. In that tour the national team was nicknamed &quot;Los Pumas&quot;, a name that became an identity mark for Argentina, remaining to present days.

Argentina has taken part in all the Rugby World Cups since the first edition in 1987, their best performance being the third place achieved in 2007. Argentina followed their growing competitiveness in the Rugby Championship with a strong showing in the 2015 World Cup, reaching the semi-finals for the second time. The national side has also played in the Rugby Championship since the 2012 edition, after joining the competition one year before.

== Colours, symbol and name ==
Argentina alternated blue and white jerseys during its first international matches in 1910. In 1927 Mr. Abelardo Gutiérrez of Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires proposed that Argentina should play against the British Lions wearing a striped light blue and white jersey. That request was accepted and Argentina wore the striped uniform for the first time in its history.

&quot;Los Pumas&quot; play in a shirt in the country&#x27;s flag (and sporting) colours of light blue and white, white shorts, and socks in light blue and white. In 2011, the UAR signed a deal with Nike which became the exclusive kit provider for all its national senior and youth teams, including Pampas XV. The first uniform designed by the American company left the traditional horizontal-striped jersey behind, featuring a single light blue with white shoulders jersey, although it was announced that &quot;Los Pumas&quot; would wear its traditional uniform again when they play the 2012 Rugby Championship.
In September 1941, Abelardo Gutiérrez (who had proposed the use of a white and blue jersey for the team 14 years prior) suggested a badge with the figure of a lion. The color of the crest was blue (due to Buenos Aires Cricket Club, where the first rugby match in Argentina had been played). The animal was later replaced by a native to Argentine species, so the jaguar was chosen due to his &quot;agility and courage&quot;, according to their words.

The &quot;Pumas&quot; nickname is the result of an error made by Carl Kohler, a journalist for the then &quot;Die Transvaler&quot; newspaper in South Africa, while following the team during their first overseas tour ever – to Southern Africa (to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and South Africa) in 1965. He tried to devise a catchy nickname for the team similar to existing international team nicknames such as &quot;All Blacks&quot;, &quot;Springboks&quot;, and &quot;Wallabies&quot;. He asked Isak van Heerden, the then coach of the Natal Rugby team who was asked by the SARB to assist with the tour, for ideas. They saw a picture of a type of lion with spots on the UAR crest. Kohler was aware that the Americas had jaguars and pumas, and as he was under pressure to submit his article, made a guess and called them the Pumas, instead of the actual jaguar. The mistake stuck, and was eventually adopted by the Argentines themselves (although the UAR crest continued to depict a jaguar until 2023).
In April 2023, the UAR launched its new visual identity that included a change of emblems not only of the body but of the national teams, from senior to 7s and youth representatives. The process included the substitution of the characteristic jaguar figure with the puma, used as a namesake for the team since the 1965 tour in Rhodesia and South Africa. That same year the UAR released the Pumas&#x27; away kit inspired by the uniform of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment, the Argentine military unit and presidential honor guard established in 1812. The away kit will be worn at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

==Home grounds==

The Pumas use a variety of stadiums when playing at home. One of the most frequently used for tests is José Amalfitani Stadium, home of Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield and sited in Buenos Aires. When Great Britain made their first tour to Argentina in 1910, the national team played them at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina of Palermo. That test was also notable for being the first Argentina match ever.

When the British combined returned to Argentina in 1927, the national side started to use GEBA and Buenos Aires Cricket Club as their home venues. GEBA was a frequent venue during the next decades, but hosted only three matches after the 1960s, as the Pumas started using larger stadiums; the &quot;Pumas&quot;&#x27; last match at GEBA was in 1993. On the other side, the Buenos Aires Cricket was also used for a large number of matches until 1948 when it was destroyed by fire.

In 1997 BACRC inaugurated the first purpose-built rugby union stadium in Argentina, erected in Los Polvorines, Greater Buenos Aires. A total of nine international games were played there by the national team until 2005 when it was sold.

&quot;Los Pumas&quot; played in Ferro Carril Oeste stadium between 1970 and 1986, when Argentina moved to Vélez Sarsfield Stadium. Some of the teams that visited those venues were Ireland, New Zealand, France, and Australia among others.

During the mid year tests in 2007, as well as Vélez Sársfield, Argentina played games at venues including Brigadier Estanislao López in Santa Fe, Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza, and Gigante de Arroyito, in Rosario. Argentina have also used the River Plate Stadium in the past, and in 2006 hosted Wales at Estadio Raúl Conti in Puerto Madryn.

Other venues that have hosted Argentina rugby team were José M. Minella in Mar del Plata (2008), Monumental José Fierro in Tucumán (2012, 2014), Mario Kempes in Córdoba (2012), Centenario in Resistencia (2014), Padre Martearena in Salta (venue for The Rugby Championship, 2016–2019 editions), Estadio del Bicentenario in San Juan –where the team played tests v England and Wales (2017–18), and Estanislao López in Santa Fe (2017).

==Records==

===Overall===

Argentina have won 251 of their 503 Test matches. When the world rankings were introduced by the IRB in October 2003, Argentina were ranked seventh. They fell to eighth in the rankings in June 2004, before rising back to seventh by November that year. They fell back to eighth in February 2005, and stayed there until falling to their lowest ranking of ninth in February 2006. Since then, Argentina rose to eighth in July 2006, then sixth in November of that year. They had a one-week fall to seventh, then one week later rose to fifth to start the World Cup 2007.

&quot;Los Pumas&quot; twice surpassed their highest ranking at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Defeating number three France, the second opening game loss for a World Cup hosting nation, moved them into fourth place, their highest position since the IRB World Rankings were established. They lost to eventual champions South Africa in the semi-final but beat France yet again in the bronze medal round to set another highest ranking, third, behind South Africa and New Zealand.

Argentina has won every match against South American national teams, including 40 against Uruguay, 40 against Chile, 17 against Paraguay and 13 against Brazil.

On 14 November 2020, they registered their first win against New Zealand, meaning that they have recorded a victory over every Tier 1 nation.

<doc id="773456" wikidata="Q1231505" url="?curid=773456" title="Smiley's People">
<text>Smiley&#x27;s People is a spy novel by John le Carré, published in 1979. Featuring British master-spy George Smiley, it is the third and final novel of the &quot;Karla Trilogy&quot;, following &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; and &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot;. George Smiley is called out of retirement to investigate the death of one of his old agents: a former Soviet general, the head of an Estonian émigré organisation based in London. Smiley learns the general had discovered information that will lead to a final confrontation with Smiley&#x27;s nemesis, the Soviet spymaster Karla.

==Plot==
Maria Ostrakova, a Soviet émigrée in Paris, is told by a Soviet agent calling himself &quot;Kursky&quot; that her daughter Alexandra, whom she was forced to leave behind, may be permitted to join her. Maria applies for an exit permit for her daughter; then, hearing nothing more, writes to General Vladimir, a former Soviet general and British agent, for help. Vladimir realises that Maria was used to provide a false identity for an unknown young woman, a ploy associated with KGB spymaster Karla, and that this is probably an unofficial operation.

Vladimir contacts Toby Esterhase, his old handler in the Circus, but Esterhase, now retired, refuses to help. Next Vladimir sends a confidant, Otto Leipzig, to Paris to interview Maria, who identifies &quot;Kursky&quot; in a photograph. Vladimir contacts the Circus again and insists on speaking to his former case officer, George Smiley, who is also retired. The Circus personnel are sceptical and uncooperative. Meanwhile, Vladimir is betrayed to Karla and assassinated on Hampstead Heath while on his way to meet a junior Circus contact.

Circus head Saul Enderby and Civil Service undersecretary Oliver Lacon, wanting to bury the matter quickly to protect the Circus from scandal, recall Smiley from retirement. Smiley takes Vladimir&#x27;s claims seriously and investigates. He recovers a second letter from Maria, who fears for her life. Near the site where Vladimir was killed, he discovers the negative of a compromising photograph of Leipzig and another man with prostitutes. Smiley consults dying former Circus researcher Connie Sachs, who identifies the second man as Oleg Kirov, also known by the cover name &quot;Kursky&quot;. She also recounts rumours that Karla had a daughter by a mistress whom he had later sent to the Gulag. The daughter, Tatiana, was unstable and was confined to a mental institution.

Smiley flies to Hamburg and tracks down Claus Kretzschmar, an old associate of Leipzig and owner of the night club where the photograph was taken. He finds that Leipzig has been murdered by Karla&#x27;s agents but manages to locate a recognition sign, in return for which Kretzschmar gives Smiley tape recordings of Leipzig and Kirov. Smiley hastens to Paris where, with help from his old colleague Peter Guillam, he gets Maria to safety before Soviet agents can murder her too. He also learns that Kirov has been summoned to Moscow and probably killed for his indiscretions.

The transcribed tape of Kirov&#x27;s confession to Leipzig shows that Karla is secretly diverting funds to a Swiss bank account using a commercial attaché named Grigoriev, of the Soviet Embassy in Bern. The money is used for the care of Karla&#x27;s daughter, who has been committed to a Swiss psychiatric sanatorium under the faked citizenship papers of Maria&#x27;s daughter. Smiley explains to Enderby that they may be able to blackmail Karla and force him to defect. Enderby authorises Smiley to mount an operation to secure the evidence from Grigoriev, but makes clear to Smiley that he will disavow him if the mission fails.

Smiley and Esterhase set up a covert team in Bern to keep Grigoriev under observation. They soon obtain evidence of his unofficial handling of funds for Karla and of an affair with an Embassy secretary. Smiley presents Grigoriev with the choice of cooperating or being reported to the Swiss authorities and, later, Karla. Grigoriev quickly confesses all he knows of the arrangements regarding Alexandra&#x27;s care and of the weekly visits he makes to her. Among her &quot;symptoms&quot; is her insistence that she is actually called Tatiana and is the daughter of a powerful man who can make people disappear. Smiley writes a letter to Karla, which Grigoriev passes on instead of his usual report on Alexandra&#x27;s treatment. The letter details Karla&#x27;s illegal activities and offers him defection to the West and protection for Tatiana, or elimination by his rivals in Moscow Centre.

In a final scene, Karla, posing as a labourer, defects using one of the bridge crossings between East and West Berlin. Before giving himself up to the waiting Western agents, Karla stops and lights a cigarette. As he passes near Smiley he drops a gold cigarette lighter, a gift to George from his wife Ann, that Karla purloined from Smiley 20 years earlier in a Delhi prison. Smiley is sickened at having to use Karla&#x27;s methods against him and does not pick up the lighter.

==Analysis== 
David Cornwell (a.k.a. John le Carré) writes out of his experience as an intelligence officer for both MI5 and the SIS (MI6). The character General Vladimir was partly modelled on Colonel Alfons Rebane, an Estonian émigré who led the Estonian portion of SIS&#x27;s Operation Jungle in the 1950s.

One review speaks of the book&#x27;s &quot;purposefully quiet, slow, downright claustrophobic austerity&quot;, through which emerges &quot;perhaps the greatest variety, texture, and integrity ever bestowed upon a series character&quot;. Though short sections deal with the experience of a few other characters, the main focus of the novel is upon Smiley himself, using different sorts of narrative to do so.

Le Carré portrays all those involved in espionage, on whichever side, as flawed people, and it is their human weaknesses which interest him and keep the narrative moving. As one critic notes of this novel, &quot;Ultimately Smiley&#x27;s people are all those who choose humanity over ideology and individuals over institutions&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Television===
&quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; was dramatized as a six-part serial for television for the BBC in 1982 as a sequel to &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979), again starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley. The screenplay was written by John le Carré and John Hopkins and was directed by Simon Langton. Two versions of this series exist: 1) the six-part UK version, which expands upon several important aspects of Smiley&#x27;s objectives and Enderby&#x27;s endorsement of these, and 2) the six-part PBS version in which much of the &quot;back story&quot; had been excised, for time.

===Radio===
In 2009–2011, BBC Radio 4 also broadcast new dramatisations, by Shaun McKenna, of the eight George Smiley novels by John le Carré, featuring Simon Russell Beale as Smiley. &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; was broadcast as three, one-hour episodes, from Thursday 20 October to Sunday 24 October 2011.

===Possible cinema version===
Following the success of the 2011 &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, Gary Oldman, who plays George Smiley in the film, said &quot;I think they&#x27;re whispering now that they might do &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;.&quot; Though nothing has yet come of the idea, it was still being refloated a decade later.

<doc id="773461" wikidata="Q3492261" url="?curid=773461" title="Holiness code">
<text>The Holiness code is used in biblical criticism to refer to Leviticus chapters 17–26, and sometimes passages in other books of the Pentateuch, especially Numbers and Exodus. It is so called due to its highly repeated use of the word &quot;holy&quot; ( &quot;qəḏōš&quot; or &quot;kadash&quot;). &quot;Kadash&quot; is usually translated as &quot;holy&quot;, but originally meant &quot;set apart&quot;, with &quot;special&quot;, &quot;clean/pure&quot;, &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; as associated meanings. The term &quot;Holiness Code&quot; was first coined as the &quot;Heiligkeitsgesetz&quot; (literally &quot;Holiness Law&quot;; the word &#x27;code&#x27; therefore means criminal code) by German theologian August Klostermann in 1877. Critical biblical scholars have regarded it as a distinct unit and have noted that the style is noticeably different from the main body of Leviticus. Unlike the remainder of Leviticus, the many laws of the Holiness Code are expressed very closely packed together, and very briefly.

According to most versions of the documentary hypothesis, the Holiness Code represents an earlier text that was edited and incorporated into the Priestly source and the Torah as a whole, although some scholars, such as Israel Knohl, believe the Holiness Code to be a later addition to the Priestly source. This source is often abbreviated as &quot;H&quot;. A date generally accepted by the proponents of the four-source hypothesis is sometime in the seventh century BC, when it presumably originated among the priests in the Temple in Jerusalem.

The Holiness Code also uses a noticeably different choice of vocabulary, repeating phrases such as &quot;I, Yahweh, am holy&quot;; &quot;I am Yahweh&quot;; and &quot;I am Yahweh, who makes you holy&quot;, an unusually large number of times. Additionally, Leviticus 17 begins with &quot;This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, saying ...&quot;, and Leviticus 26 strongly resembles the conclusion of a law code, despite the presence of further laws afterward, such as at Leviticus 27, giving the Holiness Code the appearance of a single distinct unit.

Professor Christine Hayes discusses a difference between the Holiness Code and the rest of Leviticus: in the Holiness Code, Israel itself is regarded as holy, not just the priestly class:

This theme, and the exhortation, &quot;you shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy,&quot; they find their fullest expression in the block of text; Leviticus 17 through 26 that&#x27;s referred to as the Holiness Code. There&#x27;s an important difference between Leviticus 1 through 16 and the Holiness Code. According to Leviticus 1 through 16, Israel&#x27;s priests are designated as holy: a holy class within Israel, singled out, dedicated to the service of God and demarcated by rules that apply only to them. Israelites may aspire to holiness, but it’s not assumed. However, in the Holiness Code, we have texts that come closer to the idea that Israel itself is holy by virtue of the fact that God has set Israel apart from the nations to himself, to belong to him, just as he set apart the seventh day to himself to belong with him.
== Identification of Holiness texts ==

Initially, the Holiness Code was considered part of the Priestly source by some scholars holding to the documentary hypothesis. However, other scholars generally believed it to have been an originally separate legal code (referred to as &quot;H&quot;) which the Priestly source edited and chose to embed into their writing after. Some such editing is simply the addition of phrases such as &quot;And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,&quot; designed to put the code into the context of the remainder of a code being given by God, as is the case for the remainder of Leviticus.

By 1955, scholars agreed that the Holiness Code consisted of at least Leviticus 17–26, but some twenty passages outside of it were also identified as H, including Leviticus 11 (verses 1f. and 25–40 being contested), Numbers 15:34–41 and Exodus 31:13f..

=== H texts in Leviticus ===

* Leviticus 11 (verses 1f. and 25–40 contested)

It is also alleged by critical scholarship that several additional laws, written with a style unlike that of the Holiness Code but like that of the remainder of Leviticus, were inserted into the body of the text by the Priestly source. These alleged additions are:

* The prohibition against consuming the naturally dead (Leviticus 17:15–16)
* The order to make trespass offerings after sexual involvement with an engaged slavewoman (Leviticus 19:20–22)
* The prohibition against an anointed high priest uncovering his head or rending his clothes (Leviticus 21:10)
* The prohibition against offerings by Aaronic priests who are blemished (Leviticus 21:21–22)
* The order to keep the sabbath, passover, and feast of unleavened bread (Leviticus 23:1–10a)
* The order to keep Yom Kippur, and Sukkot (Leviticus 23:23–44)
* The order for continual bread and oil (Leviticus 24:1–9)
* Case law concerning a blasphemer (Leviticus 24:10–15a and 24:23)
* The order for a trumpet sounding on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 25:9b)
* Rules concerning redeeming property (Leviticus 25:23 and 25:26–34)
* Order to release Israelite slaves at the year of jubilee (Leviticus 25:40, 25:42, 25:44–46)
* Rules concerning redeeming people (Leviticus 25:48–52, and 25:54)

The section concerning continual bread and oil is, in critical scholarship, viewed as part of the description of the structure of the tabernacle, and vestments, present at the end of Exodus, which has accidentally become inserted at this point due to scribal error. The case law example of blasphemy is believed to be the work of one of the later editions of the Priestly source, in which several other case law examples were added, such as that concerning the daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 36). The remainder of the alleged additions arguably deform the laws from the manner they would otherwise have, to the laws supported by the Priestly Code. Whether these represent alterations to the law over time, lawmaking by the writer of the political faction supported by the Priestly source, or simply details present but not originally thought worth mentioning, is a matter of some debate.

=== H texts in Exodus and Numbers ===

More recent critical scholarship, particularly that of Israel Knohl, and Jacob Milgrom, has argued instead that the Holiness Code (H) was the appendage, and the Priestly Code (P) the original. This view also identifies passages outside the traditional area of H, specifically in Exodus and Numbers, as belonging to the Holiness Code rather than P, such as the order to sound a trumpet on certain dates. In consequence, this view sees the author of H as the editor of P, rather than the reverse, in particular as P is able to be read coherently even when devoid of H. Nevertheless, the presence of what appears to be a clear ending to H (specifically Leviticus 26, which would be expected to have been moved), such as to be after Leviticus 27, if H were the addition, rather than the original, has presented some problems for such revising of the theory.

Israel Knohl (1995) argued that Numbers 25:6–18 and the entire chapter of Numbers 31 were part of the Holiness code (H), which was later added to the Priestly source. He pointed to similarities in content, such as the focus on purification in Numbers 5:1–4, chapter 19 and 31:19–24, as well as in linguistics in Numbers 10:9, 27:17, 31:6,19 and Exodus 40:15, all of which had been previously identified with the Holiness School (HS) by other scholars. Some linguistic and theological features also distinguish Numbers 31 from the Priestly Torah (PT) text, such as the wrath of God, which is mentioned several times by HS but never by PT. Some scholars think that the text of Numbers 25:6–18 was written at a time when the priestly line of Phinehas&#x27; descendants was being challenged. Sarah Shectman (2009) agreed with Knohl and other scholars that Numbers 25:6–18 is to be identified as an H text, and argued that traditional interpretations of verse 25:6 as an act of sexual transgression were incorrect. In fact, Zimri and Kozbi were not guilty of sexual transgressions at all; sex with a foreigner is never even considered a capital offence by the Holiness code (H). Rather, they had come too close to the holy Tabernacle, also called the &#x27;Tent of the Congregation&#x27;, an act which in previous episodes in the Book of Numbers (also probably authored by H) had also caused Yahweh to cast a plague on the Israelites, or to threaten doing so.

Texts in the books of Exodus and Numbers which have so far been identified as H texts by scholars include:
* Exodus 20:11 (contested)
* Exodus 20:18
* Exodus 31:12–17 (verses 16 and 17 contested)
* Exodus 40:15
* Numbers 5:1–4
* Numbers 8:19
* Numbers 10:9
* Numbers 15:34–41
* Numbers 17:11–12
* Numbers 19
* Numbers 25:6–18, see also Numbers 31 § Authorship and Numbers 31 § Motive
* Numbers 27:1–11
* Numbers 27:17
* Numbers 31
* Numbers 36:1–12

==Composition==

The Holiness Code is a collection of many laws concerning several subjects. Critical scholarship therefore regards it as being generally a work constructed by the collecting together of a series of earlier collections of laws. One of the most noticeable elements of the work is a large section concerning various sexual activities, which are prohibited &quot;lest the land vomit you out&quot;. These prohibitions include sexual relations with one&#x27;s mother, step-mother, sister, step-sister, sister-in-law, aunt, granddaughter, daughter-in-law, with a woman as well as her daughter, with a ritually unclean woman, with the wife of a neighbor, with another man, or with an animal; and the sacrifice of children to Molech (numerated just prior to Lev.18:22. These prohibitions are listed in Leviticus 18, and again in chapter 20, both times with the warning &quot;lest the land vomit you out.&quot;

While Leviticus 18 presents them as a simple list, Leviticus 20 presents them in a chiastic structure based on how serious a crime they are viewed, as well as presenting the punishment deemed appropriate for each, ranging from excommunication to execution. Leviticus 20 also presents the list in a more verbose manner.

Furthermore, Leviticus 22:11–21 parallels Leviticus 17, and there are, according to textual criticism, passages at Leviticus 18:26, 19:37, 22:31–33, 24:22, and 25:55, which have the appearance of once standing at the end of independent laws or collections of laws as colophons. For this reason, several scholars view the five sections preceding between each of these passages as deriving from originally separate documents. In particular, the two segments containing the sexual prohibitions, Leviticus 17:2–18:26 and Leviticus 20:1–22:33, are seen as being based on essentially the same law code, with Leviticus 20:1–22:33 regarded as the later version of the two.

Chapter 19, which ends in a colophon, has a similarity with the Ten Commandments (Ethical Decalogue), although presenting a more detailed and expanded version, leading critical scholars to conclude it represents a much later version of that decalogue. Notably, it contains the commandment popularly referred to as &quot;love thy neighbour as thyself&quot; (the Great Commandment).

By this reckoning, there are thus at least five earlier law collections which were redacted together, with an additional hortatory conclusion, to form the Holiness Code. Two of which contain a list of sexual prohibitions, and one of which was a development of the Ritual Decalogue.

==Comparison with other biblical law codes==

Most critical scholars and religious commentaries regard the Holiness Code as bearing strong resemblance, in several places, to the writing of Ezekiel. Ezekiel dwells repeatedly on offences which the Holiness Code condemns, and spends little time concerned with those outside it (e.g. Leviticus 18:8–17 in comparison with Ezekiel 22:10–11), and several extensive lists of such parallels exist. There is also a great similarity between Ezekiel&#x27;s writing and the hortatory elements, particularly the conclusion, of the Holiness Code. These strong similarities have led many critical scholars to question whether Ezekiel was the author of the code, or at least the collector, and it remains an open question whether the Holiness Code influenced Ezekiel, or Ezekiel influenced the Holiness Code.

The Holiness Code has a similarity of structure with both the Covenant Code and the Deuteronomic Code. Like these, it opens with a law regulating ceremonies at the altar, lists a series of disparate laws, and then closes with a set of promises for obeying the law, and curses for failing to do so. While some of the laws appear more developed than Deuteronomy, for example, the law concerning weights and measures is more detailed, the majority show less development, and the implication of multiple sanctuaries implied by the Holiness Code&#x27;s laws, concerning altar ceremonies, is usually understood to imply a date prior to the banning of sanctuaries outside the temple at Jerusalem. A similar comparison with the Covenant Code implies that the date of the Holiness Code is between that of the Covenant Code, and that of the Deuteronomic Code, highly suitable for the position it finds itself within the Torah.

In the documentary hypothesis, the Priestly source is a work which, after its initial edition, suffered under the hand of several later, less skilled, editors, who each variously inserted documents, added additional laws, or expanded on the laws already present. Thus the original narrative, and the legal code within it, became surrounded by an extensive body of legal, and ritual, elements, as well as numerical, genealogical, and geographic, data. The underlying narrative, in the hypothesis, is based on JE, which already possessed a legal code, namely the Covenant Code and Ritual Decalogue. The majority of critical scholars thus support the position that, while the Ritual Decalogue was replaced by the Ethical Decalogue, the Holiness Code was chosen, or designed, to replace the Covenant Code.

== Modern view of Leviticus ==

The Holiness Code is believed to have been written as a form to avoid sexual deviations, sexually transmittable diseases and other forms of physical illness for the people of Israel with some specified as applicable for Proselytes. Some of its teachings are still in practice in the evangelical church, however see Leviticus 18 and Biblical law in Christianity for details.

Among Mainline Protestants, there is debate about how much of this passage can be applicable today since the Levitical priesthood and animal sacrifice ended in AD 70, with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. Many in these groups see references to sexuality therein and as being reiterated for emphasis elsewhere in the Bible; for example, in the Epistle to the Romans. Orthodox Jews continue many of the practices, but they generally regard precepts not in current practice as being in only temporary abeyance until a Third Temple can be rebuilt and they can be restored.

<doc id="773481" wikidata="Q283310" url="?curid=773481" title="Space–time tradeoff">
<text>A space–time trade-off, also known as time–memory trade-off or the algorithmic space-time continuum in computer science is a case where an algorithm or program trades increased space usage with decreased time. Here, &quot;space&quot; refers to the data storage consumed in performing a given task (RAM, HDD, etc.), and &quot;time&quot; refers to the time consumed in performing a given task (computation time or response time).

The utility of a given space–time tradeoff is affected by related fixed and variable costs (of, e.g., CPU speed, storage space), and is subject to diminishing returns.

==History==
Biological usage of time–memory tradeoffs can be seen in the earlier stages of animal behavior. Using stored knowledge or encoding stimuli reactions as &quot;instincts&quot; in the DNA avoids the need for &quot;calculation&quot; in time-critical situations. More specific to computers, look-up tables have been implemented since the very earliest operating systems.

In 1980 Martin Hellman first proposed using a time–memory tradeoff for cryptanalysis.

==Types of tradeoff==
===Lookup tables vs. recalculation===
A common situation is an algorithm involving a lookup table: an implementation can include the entire table, which reduces computing time, but increases the amount of memory needed, or it can compute table entries as needed, increasing computing time, but reducing memory requirements.

===Database indexes vs. table scans===
Database Management Systems offer the capability to create Database index data structures. Indexes improve the speed of lookup operations at the cost of additional space. Without indexes, time-consuming Full table scan operations are sometimes required to locate desired data.

===Compressed vs. uncompressed data===
A space–time trade off can be applied to the problem of data storage. If data is stored uncompressed, it takes more space but access takes less time than if the data were stored compressed (since compressing the data reduces the amount of space it takes, but it takes time to run the decompression algorithm). Depending on the particular instance of the problem, either way is practical. There are also rare instances where it is possible to directly work with compressed data, such as in the case of compressed bitmap indices, where it is faster to work with compression than without compression.

===Re-rendering vs. stored images===
Storing only the SVG source of a vector image and rendering it as a bitmap image every time the page is requested would be trading time for space; more time used, but less space. Rendering the image when the page is changed and storing the rendered images would be trading space for time; more space used, but less time. This technique is more generally known as caching.

===Smaller code vs. loop unrolling===
Larger code size can be traded for higher program speed when applying loop unrolling. This technique makes the code longer for each iteration of a loop, but saves the computation time required for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration.

==Other examples==
Algorithms that also make use of space–time tradeoffs include:
* Baby-step giant-step algorithm for calculating discrete logarithms
* Rainbow tables in cryptography, where the adversary is trying to do better than the exponential time required for a brute-force attack. Rainbow tables use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to crack passwords in minutes instead of weeks. Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to iterate over the hash space.
* The meet-in-the-middle attack uses a space–time tradeoff to find the cryptographic key in only formula_1 encryptions (and formula_2 space) versus the expected formula_3 encryptions (but only formula_4 space) of the naive attack.
* Dynamic programming, where the time complexity of a problem can be reduced significantly by using more memory.
* Time/memory/data tradeoff attack which uses the space–time tradeoff with the additional parameter of data.

<doc id="773488" wikidata="Q14709349" url="?curid=773488" title="Willamette Stone">
<text>The Willamette Stone was a small stone obelisk originally installed by the Department of Interior in 1885 in the western hills of Portland, Oregon, in the United States to mark the intersection and origin of the Willamette [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] and Willamette [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. It replaced a cedar stake placed by the Surveyor General of the Oregon Territory in 1851; this stake defined the grid system of sections and townships from which all real property in the states of Oregon and Washington has been measured following the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850. The Willamette meridian runs north–south, and the Willamette baseline runs east–west through the marker. The easternmost northeast corner of Washington County is sited on the marker.

==History==
The location of the obelisk is now indicated by a stainless steel marker in Willamette Stone State Heritage Site, an Oregon state park approximately west of downtown Portland. The site is near Skyline Boulevard, in the West Hills overlooking the Tualatin Valley and the Willamette River watershed.

The grid defined by the stone extended the Public Land Survey System and was used as the basis of land claims in the Oregon Territory. The first marker, a red cedar stake, was placed on the site on June 4, 1851, by John B. Preston, the first Surveyor General of the Oregon Territory. Preston was appointed by President Millard Fillmore to create a system for surveying land in the territory; he lost his position in 1853, and &quot;drifted into obscurity.&quot; The location was chosen such that the baseline would not cross the Columbia River and the meridian would lie west of Vancouver Lake. The meridian and baseline were surveyed using solar compasses by James E. Freeman of Wisconsin and William Ives of Michigan. Ives surveyed the baseline in both directions and the meridian to the north; Freeman surveyed the meridian to the south. The grid system was an extension of the system used in the Northwest Territory proposed by Thomas Jefferson. The Willamette Stone marked the location of the first townships and ranges north and south of the marker.

The Department of Interior replaced the stake with a stone obelisk on July 25, 1885. On two sides, the stone was marked with the words &quot;BASE&quot; and &quot;LINE&quot;, while on the other two sides it was marked with the words &quot;WILL.&quot; and &quot;MER.&quot; As the stone was vandalized in the 1980s, the federal government replaced it with the current marker. An accompanying bronze plaque was also placed by the State of Oregon which read:

Beginning here, the Willamette meridian was established running north to Puget Sound and south to the California border, and the baseline was established running east to the Idaho border and west to the Pacific Ocean.As part of the replacement project, the park was also improved which included adding signage, information boards, and improving the trail and parking areas. The park was re-dedicated by Governor Vic Atiyeh in 1988.

==Streets==
The location of the Willamette meridian and Willamette baseline can be identified by various streets that follow or parallel their courses, often named to call attention to this fact.

===North–South streets and the meridian===

;Streets named because they follow the meridian
*In Clackamas County, SW Stafford Road and Meridian Road follow the meridian.
*In Marion County several sections of Meridian Road follow the meridian, but hilly terrain forces many deviations.
*In Linn County, portions of Meridian Heights Loop, north of Sweet Home follow the meridian.
*In Jackson County, Meridian Road follows several miles of the meridian.
*In Thurston County, Washington, east of Lacey, three sections of Meridian Road follow the meridian, totaling about three miles (5 km).
*In Kitsap County, Washington, west of Silverdale near Apex Airport, Willamette Meridian Road NW follows the meridian for about three miles (5 km).

;Other streets that follow the meridian
*In Multnomah County, SW 65th Avenue and a short section of Interstate 5 immediately south of the Barbur Blvd. interchange overlay the meridian.
*In Clark County, Washington, north of Ridgefield, NW 71st Avenue follows the meridian for about two miles.
*In Lewis County, Washington, east of Toledo, Templeton and Schmidt roads follow the meridian for the mile adjacent to SR 505. South of US Highway 12 at Ethel, Tucker and Classe Roads follow the meridian for about 3 miles.
*In Pierce County, Washington, on the Key Peninsula, 150th Avenue S follows the meridian its entire length.
*In Thurston County, Washington, east of Lacey, Tucker Road SE (no relation to the Tucker Road in Lewis County) follows the meridian for about .
*In Kitsap County, Washington, near the western border of Naval Submarine Base Bangor, parts of Lester Road NW, Grampus Road, and Snook Road follow the meridian for a total of about two miles.
*In Whatcom County, Washington, near Birch Bay, Jackson Road (south of the bay) and Harborview Road (north of the bay) both follow the meridian, for a total of about five miles.
*In Jefferson County, Washington, near Hadlock, Cleveland Street, south of Port Townsend Bay, follows the meridian for about 3 blocks.

;Streets named because they parallel the meridian
*In Whatcom County, Washington, Guide Meridian Road (State Route 539) is named after the Guide Meridian between R2E and R3E, east of the Willamette meridian.
*In Newberg, Meridian Street is several miles west of the Willamette meridian.

===East–West streets and the baseline===

;Streets named because they follow the baseline
*Baseline Road in Tillamook, Washington, Hood River, Gilliam, and Morrow counties all follow or start at the Willamette baseline.

;Other streets that follow the baseline
*Stark Street in east Portland (formerly Base Line Road) and Washington County follows the Willamette baseline.

;Streets named because they parallel the baseline
*Division Street in Portland (formerly Section Line Road) follows the division between the first and second rows of square-mile sections south of the Willamette baseline.

<text>The Ibero-American University (), also referred to by its acronym UIA but commonly known as Ibero or La Ibero, is a private, Catholic, Mexican higher education institution, sponsored by the Mexican province of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit). In 2009, the UIA received the SEP-ANUIES Prize as the best private university in Mexico. The Ibero&#x27;s flagship campus is located in the Santa Fe district of Mexico City. 

Its main library, Biblioteca Francisco Xavier Clavigero, holds more than 400,000 books and journals and as of 2007 is one of the largest university libraries in the country. It also has one of the largest law libraries in Mexico.

Other institutions affiliated with, but independent from, Ibero in Mexico City are found in Guadalajara, León, Torreón, Puebla, Playas de Tijuana, and Jaltepec. Together, they form the Jesuit University System, a network of Jesuit-run private universities.

==History==
The university was founded in 1943 by the Society of Jesus, but with the significant aid of Rodolfo Brito Foucher, the rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Brito Foucher, a lawyer and head of UNAM&#x27;s law faculty before becoming rector, was of the opinion that this was not counter to the Constitution of 1917&#x27;s prohibition of Catholic involvement in education, since the article did not specify higher education but only primary and secondary. A key group in the founding of Ibero was former student activists from the Jesuit-directed &quot;&quot; (UNEC). The founding came at a time when church-state relations in Mexico had improved over the late 1920s during the Cristero War and in the 1930s when the government attempted to implement education toward socialism in the Mexican universities.

Originally called Centro Cultural Universitario, Ibero grew into a full-scale university after ten years due to the patronage of the business community which donated funds for building the campus and for guaranteeing loans as the university was being established. When the Mexican economy expanded during the 1940s to 1960s, Ibero-trained professionals who entered the private sector, many of the former leaders of the UNEC served on the university&#x27;s board of trustees. Ibero had the aim of promoting Catholic culture and of training elites to take leading roles in Mexican society. Ibero has trained a number of successful businessmen and politicians, including the successful presidential candidate of the National Action Party (Mexico), Vicente Fox.

The Society of Jesus has from its start in the 16th century been a leader in humanistic education. When Jesuits reached New Spain in 1572, their religious and educational zeal led them to create renowned teaching and research centers – such as the colleges of St. Ildefonso, Vizcainas, and St. Peter and St. Paul, to mention a few of the prestigious institutions of that time. The Ibero is part of a network of 8 Jesuit universities located in various Mexican cities which, in turn, are part of 31 Jesuit universities and colleges in Latin American and some 200 worldwide.

==Campus==
In 1988 moved to a 48-acre (19 hectares) new campus in the Santa Fe area of Mexico City. Besides classrooms, laboratories, and workshops in physics, chemistry, photography, design, psychology, engineering, communications, architecture, and nutrition, the university houses the Francisco Xavier Clavigero library, the FM 90.9 radio station, and several auditoriums. Other facilities on campus include sports fields and related conveniences, a medical center, three cafeterias, an on-campus bookstore, a stationery shop, bank branches, and other university stores.

===Ibero-American University Tijuana===

&quot;Ibero-American University Tijuana&quot; () in Playas de Tijuana, Tijuana, Mexico, was founded by the Jesuits in 1982. It is a part of the Mexican Jesuit University System. as one of the Mexico City colleges.

In 1982, opened its campus in Tijuana at two sites, one rented and the other on the premises of La Paz College. Later space was rented in the Civil Hospital building. At first only high school studies and degrees in architecture, graphic design, and law were offered. In 1985, the cornerstone was laid for the present building.

<text>The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) is a sports stadium in the Moore Park suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is used for Test, One Day International and Twenty20 cricket, as well as, Australian rules football and occasionally for rugby league, rugby union and association football. It is the home ground for the New South Wales Blues cricket team, the Sydney Sixers of the Big Bash League and the Sydney Swans of the Australian Football League. It is owned and operated by Venues NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales who also hold responsibility for Stadium Australia and the Sydney Football Stadium.

==History==
=== Beginning ===
In 1811, the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, established the second Sydney Common, about one-and-a-half miles (about 2,400m) wide and extending south from South Head Road (now Oxford St) to where Randwick Racecourse is today. Part sandhills, part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city, it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s, and not regarded as an ideal place for sport. In 1851, part of the Sydney Common south of Victoria Barracks was granted to the British Army for use as a garden and cricket ground for the soldiers. Its first user was the 11th North Devonshire Regiment which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks.

In the next couple of years, the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club. The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854.

Up until that time Hyde Park had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play.
In the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common, the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street, was opened for public recreation. It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney, Charles Moore, who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day. As well as the location of Sydney&#x27;s first zoo, Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos. Sydney at the time was a small, dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts. It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city.
When the commander of the Sydney garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson, aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club, the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground. In 1870 British troops left Victoria Barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain. However, with the closure of the Albert Ground in the 1870s, the NSW Cricket Association (NSWCA) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground.

In 1875, the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground. Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford, Redfern, Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control, the then president of the NSWCA, Richard Driver (after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named), persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground&#x27;s administration. In 1876, the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir Hercules Robinson.
The NSWCA had influential supporters. Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the City of Sydney Council. The Minister for Lands, Thomas Garrett, was also supportive; his son was about to break into the colonial side. It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground, the governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, appointed Driver himself, William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan (after whom a grandstand was named), the first trustees. Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA. The close relationship between the Trust and the NSWCA is evidenced by the fact that they pooled funds for the next six years. The military&#x27;s link with the ground was finally severed when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison went to fight in the Sudan. The trustees then took the opportunity to rename the ground the Association Ground.

In 1883 the most prominent trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as the responsibility of the trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground. Over the next century there was constant conflict between the Trust and the NSWCA over whether other sports such as rugby, tennis and cycling, the organisers of which were all keen to use the venue, had access to it. One conflict in 1904, over the Trust&#x27;s plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended up in court. The NSWCA&#x27;s influence was eventually reduced even further over the years due to changes in the way the State Government appointed trustees.

===Development===

By the time of the first Sydney cricket test in February 1882, the ground could boast two grandstands; the Brewongle Stand at the southern end and the original Members&#x27; Stand, which had been built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members&#x27; Stand now sits. On opposite sides of the ground to the stands two spectator mounds were built. They became known as The Hill and the Paddington Hill.

In 1886, the Members&#x27; Pavilion was rebuilt at a cost of £6,625. Membership was levied at two guineas.

In 1881 a loop in the tram line, which ran down Randwick Road (now Anzac Parade), was built to service the Ground and the Pastoral and Agricultural Society Ground (later the RAS Showgrounds and now Fox Studios) next door.

In 1894 the ground finally received its modern name, the Sydney Cricket Ground, which was followed by the opening of the Hill Stand, situated between The Hill and the Paddington Hill. It became known as the Bob Stand during the Depression years because it cost one shilling (a bob) to enter.

The first SCG scoreboard was built in the two weeks leading up to the 1895–1896 inter-colonial match between New South Wales and Victoria. Although it was Sheridan&#x27;s idea, the design was Ned Gregory&#x27;s who believed that English scoreboards were inadequate. Requiring two men to operate it, the new scoreboard was hailed as one of the wonders of the cricket world. Boards with players&#x27; names on them were placed in different slits alongside scrolls of canvas with numbers painted on them which were rolled up and down to show the changing score. Under the scoreboard was a refreshment stall which sold, among other things, oysters.
In 1896 the Ladies&#x27; Stand was opened, along with a concrete cycling track which circled the inside of the ground. One of the carpenters who built the formwork for the track was George Bradman, father of Don Bradman. In 1898 floodlights were built over the cycling track so that night events could be held. In 1904 the scoreboard was rebuilt at the top of The Hill and in 1909 the Sheridan Stand, named after Phil Sheridan, was opened at the southern end, replacing the earlier Smokers&#x27; Stand.

In the period up to World War I the SCG was used for a wide variety of sports including athletics, tennis, baseball, football and cycling. The cycling track however was removed in 1920. In 1924 Ned Gregory&#x27;s scoreboard was closed and the concrete scoreboard at the back of the Hill opened.
During the 1920s, and 1930s crowds packed into the SCG to see Don Bradman play for New South Wales and Australia. Many of the huge gate takings that Bradman brought in for the NSWCA were spent on developing the ground. A large new stand was built at the northern end in two stages. It replaced the Northern Stand and was intended to also replace the Members&#x27; and Ladies&#x27; Stands. The first stage, begun while Bradman was still playing for New South Wales, was opened in 1936 at a cost of £90,000 and named the &#x27;M.A. Noble Stand&#x27; after the great Australian captain Monty Noble. The second stage, completed in 1973 at a cost of $2 million, was named the Bradman Stand after the great man himself.

Further redevelopment of the ground began in 1978 with the advent of World Series Cricket (WSC) and games played at night. When media giant Kerry Packer failed to obtain the television broadcast rights for cricket, he bought the top 30–40 players in the world and staged his own competition, World Series Cricket.

Packer applied to use the SCG for WSC in 1977 but the SCG Trust, which administered the ground, refused. However the NSW Labor Government, under Premier Neville Wran, amended the &quot;Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Act&quot; to remove the Trust&#x27;s power to decide who played at the SCG and the NSWCA&#x27;s traditional right over the ground. A new Trust was established with 12 members appointed by the Government and two elected by SCG members. The new Trust had no WSC opponents, and although legal action by the NSWCA stopped WSC games being played at the SCG in 1977, they were played there in 1978.
In the years since WSC the character of the SCG has somewhat changed. Six light towers were built in 1978 at a cost of $1.2 million so that cricket could be played at night, and two huge new stands were constructed at the southern end of the ground. The new Brewongle Stand was built on the site of the old Brewongle Stand at a cost $8.9 million and opened in 1980. The Churchill Stand, named after rugby league legend Clive Churchill, replaced the Sheridan Stand at a cost of $8.2 million and was opened in 1986.

The old concrete scoreboard was closed in 1983 and a new electronic board erected above The Hill. This board allowed the crowd to see video replays and provided more scope for advertising. The old concrete scoreboard from 1986 sat behind the Doug Walters Stand unused until 2006 when it was dismantled and stored offsite to make way for the Victor Trumper Stand.

The Bob Stand has been moved to North Sydney Oval, replaced by the Bill O&#x27;Reilly Stand. This stand was originally named the Pat Hills Stand, after the NSW Labor Government Minister and SCG Trust member, when it was opened in 1984 alongside the Paddington Stand, later known as the Dally Messenger Stand. However, the incoming Greiner Government changed the name of the former to the O&#x27;Reilly Stand after the legendary spin bowler.

The Hill also has gone but the reason for that is a little harder to pin. Up until 1991 the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the &#x27;outer ground&#x27; costing the least to get in and attracting working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill in 1991 failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.
Further developments have taken place in more recent years with the internal reconstruction of the M.A. Noble stand completed in 1994 and the opening of the NSW Cricket Centre in 1997. This facility includes indoor training wickets and administrative offices for Cricket NSW (formerly NSW Cricket Association). In 1999 the original electronic scoreboard was replaced by a new higher-definition video screen. In the 21st century the Hill and Doug Walters Stand has been completely redeveloped with a new 12,000 seat Victor Trumper Stand, completed in 2008. This stand brings the SCG&#x27;s capacity to 46,000 spectators. During the re-development, the 2 original light towers on the hill were replaced and the 4 other light towers were upgraded, a new video screen was also installed in the Clive Churchill stand, replacing the screen that was on the hill.

The SCG Trust rebuilt the MA Noble, Don Bradman and Dally Messenger stands for the 2013–14 Ashes series, it increased ground capacity to 48,000 spectators. This redevelopment was mostly completed in March 2014 at a cost of $197.5 million and also included a large new video screen in the Messenger Stand.

In September 2018, construction began on a new video screen to replace the video screen at the Messenger Stand with the LED panels for the screen transferred across from the Sydney Football Stadium with an upgrade to the video screen in the Clive Churchill Stand and new LED advertising banners being installed in all of the stands except for the Members&#x27; and Ladies&#x27; pavilions. The work was completed in time for Sydney FC&#x27;s first ever A-League game at the SCG.

Since 2015, the Trust, now Venues NSW, are keen on redeveloping the Bill O&#x27;Reilly stand, and later the Churchill and Brewongle stands, further increasing the grounds capacity. The ground will be a near complete modern &quot;bowl&quot; stadium with the exception of the two heritage listed Members&#x27; and Ladies&#x27; pavilions.

==Stands==
In its present configuration, the SCG is a playing field surrounded by a collection of separate grandstand structures. From the northern end, clockwise, they are:
*M.A Noble, Bradman and Dally Messenger stands: The largest structure at the ground, was constructed in 2013–2014, although hosting three named &#x27;stands&#x27; is one integrated grandstand. The stand contains corporate boxes, media facilities, a changeroom used by visiting AFL and NRL teams and members seating for SCG (formerly SCG Trust) members and in the winter is shared with eligible Swans members as well as public reserved seating in the Bradman and Messenger stands. The Dally Messenger Stand is also home to the main video screen for the ground. The new stand replaced the older Noble and Bradman stands in the same location with the clock tower of the original Noble stand preserved.
*Bill O&#x27;Reilly Stand (previously named Pat Hills Stand): Constructed 1984, replaced the &#x27;Bob&#x27; stand, with corporate boxes and public reserved seating.
*Victor Trumper Stand: Constructed in 2007–2008, replaced Yabba&#x27;s Hill and Doug Walters Stand, with corporate boxes and public reserved and unreserved seating.
*Clive Churchill Stand: Constructed 1986, with corporate boxes and public reserved seating. It also housed the Sydney Swans training and administration facilities before those were moved to the Royal Hall of Industries Building in the former Sydney Showground precinct in 2023. 
*Brewongle Stand: Constructed 1980 with corporate boxes, media facilities and public reserved seating. It was previously thought that the stand was named after the aboriginal word for &quot;camping place&quot;. However the stand was named after a tea room at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Sydney Swans changerooms are located beneath the Brewongle stand.

*Ladies&#x27; Pavilion: Constructed 1896, originally for female-only members&#x27; seating; also used for general public admission during events with low attendance. Now general members seating. Referred to as the Jane Mcgrath Stand on day three of the annual Sydney Test, also known as Mcgrath Day or Pink day.
*Members&#x27; Pavilion: A cast iron, brick and corrugated iron structure with clock tower constructed in 1878 for SCG Members&#x27; seating, housing dressing rooms used by Australian and New South Wales cricket teams and visiting cricket teams. Extensions were made to the pavilion in 1903.
==Sydney Cricket Ground Trust==
The Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust (popularly known as the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust) was the agency that operated the Sydney Cricket Ground and the old Sydney Football Stadium at Moore Park. In mid-2008, its head office The Sheridan Building is opened, making it the third building to erect in the Gold Members Car Park, alongside the Headquarters of Sydney Roosters and New South Wales Rugby Union. The trust was merged into Venues NSW, which now operates the SCG as well as the new Sydney Football Stadium.

Soon after it opened Sydney FC relocated their Headquarters inside the Sheridan Building. The Sydney Swans headquarters are located in the SCG accessible from Driver Avenue. In total, there are 4 different clubs from 4 different codes of sport with their headquarters reside at the ground.

===Statues===
The Trust has commissioned ten bronze sculpture statues to be placed around the grounds of the SCG and SFS.

===Media Hall of Honour===
In 2014 the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust opened the Media Hall of Honour at the MA Noble Stand&#x27;s media centre with fifteen inaugural inductees: Another twelve names were added to the list in December 2021.

===Other tributes===
On 24 April 2023, the Sydney Cricket Ground unveiled a set of gates named after Indian Test cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and West Indian Test cricketer Brian Lara on the occasion of Tendulkar&#x27;s 50th birthday and the 30th anniversary of Lara&#x27;s innings of 277 at the ground. The Lara–Tendulkar Gates are used by visiting teams entering the playing field from the Members&#x27; Pavilion visitors dressing room.

The Australian and New South Wales cricket teams enter the playing field through the Don Bradman Gates between the Members&#x27; and Ladies&#x27; Pavilions. The Arthur Morris and Alan Davidson Gates are located on Driver Avenue in the brick wall north of the SCG Members Entrance. The two separate steel gates are designed with SCG, AKD and ARM monograms in the metalwork.

==Cricket==
=== Nature of pitch ===
Sydney Cricket Ground is traditionally one of the most spin-friendly international cricket grounds in Australia, because the soil and foundation of the pitch and playing surface is primarily &#x27;Bulli soil&#x27; from Bulli, New South Wales. The SCG along with the Gabba in Brisbane are the only major test venues in Australia not to have switched to a drop-in pitch. 

===History and notable events===
In 1854 the Garrison Club defeated the Royal Victoria Club in the first recorded cricket match to be played at what was then the Garrison Ground. Although games were played at the Domain, the Garrison Ground was used for practice by the NSW cricket team in 1860 and by the Victorian team in 1861 the before inter-colonial matches in those years.

Cricket was first played in Australia in Sydney&#x27;s Hyde Park in 1803. However, up until the appointment of trustees to look after the SCG in the late 1870s, several different grounds had been used. The Domain was first used for inter-colonial games and then the Albert Ground in Redfern but in time both became unavailable, the Domain because of its poor condition and because it could not be fenced in and the Albert Ground because it closed in the late 1870s.

After the closure of the Albert Ground the New South Wales Cricket Association began using the Association Ground. The first game played there was the final of the Civil Service Challenge Cup on 25 October 1877, between the New South Wales Government Printing Office and the Audit Office. The first first-class match was the inter-colonial game between New South Wales and Victoria played on 22, 23 and 25 February 1878 where New South Wales won by 1 wicket.

During the 1878–79 season Lord Harris&#x27; England team toured Australia. The feature of the tourists game against New South Wales at the SCG in 1879 was a riot sparked apparently when the crowd disagreed with an umpiring decision by George Coulthard that went against the locals. Lord Harris believed the invasion of the ground by about 2000 spectators was actually started by bookmakers in the stand. One of the umpires for the match was Edmund Barton, later to become Australia&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

By the time its first Test match was played at the SCG between 17 February and 21 February 1882 the ground was in fine condition. The NSWCA had appointed Ned Gregory as curator and given him a cottage next to the ground for him and his family. Australia won that game by overhauling England&#x27;s scores of 133 and 232 with scores of 197 and 5 for 169.

The ground high score in Test cricket was held for more than a century by Englishman Reg &quot;Tip&quot; Foster, who scored 287 in an Australia-England match in 1903. In the 100th test to be played at the SCG in January 2012, Michael Clarke was joined first by Ricky Ponting in a partnership of 288 and then by Michael Hussey in a partnership of 334 and built a score of 329 not out against India.

Don Bradman made his first visit to the ground in the 1920–21 season to watch the Fifth Test of the Australia and England series. In that game Charlie Macartney scored 170 to help seal a win for Australia.

Bradman scored the highest ever first-class innings of 452 at the SCG for New South Wales against Queensland in 1928–29. This record was surpassed by Hanif Mohammad who scored 499 run out at Karachi. It was further bettered by the West Indian Brian Lara who scored 501 in 1994 at Edgbaston.

The 1928–29 season was a big one for cricket. On 15 December, the largest ever crowd to attend a cricket match at the SCG, 58,446, saw Australia and England play. With changes to the ground seating the record is unlikely to be beaten.

In the last test of the 1970–71 English tour, England fast bowler John Snow struck Australian spinner and tailender Terry Jenner on the head with a bouncer. The Sydney crowd let Snow and the English know they were not happy with his behaviour and when Snow took up his fielding position on the fence a spectator spoke to him and grabbed him by the shirt. Cans were thrown onto the field and England captain Ray Illingworth took his team from the ground.

The first women&#x27;s club cricket match was held at the SCG in 1886 when the Fernleas played the Siroccos. Although cricket was not seen as an appropriate game for women, women&#x27;s cricket associations were formed in Victoria in 1905 and other states in the 1920s, and 1930s.

Night cricket was first played at the SCG on 28 November 1978 with World Series Cricket. A crowd of 50,000 packed the ground.

The SCG was the scene of Shane Warne&#x27;s first (1992) and final Tests (2007). In 2007, Justin Langer and Glenn McGrath also played their final Tests.

During the 100th Test match held at SCG, on 3 January 2012, Michael Clarke scored his maiden triple century against India and was the first player to do so at the ground. Exactly nine years before, Steve Waugh scored a century to retain The Ashes, and it was also the scene of his final test against India in 2004.

The SCG was venue of two 5-0 Ashes Series clean sweeps (completed in early 2007 and 2014).

SCG is the traditional ground for hosting New Year Tests, as well as the traditional final match of the Australian Ashes Series. Since 2008, the New Year Test has also been named the Pink Test, organised by Glenn McGrath and the McGrath Foundation, named for his late wife Jane McGrath to raise breast cancer awareness, and on the third day, even if the day&#x27;s play is rained out, is named Pink Day or Jane McGrath Day in her honour.

The SCG was the scene of tragedy on 25 November 2014, when a bouncer from Sean Abbott struck Phillip Hughes&#x27;s neck, knocking him unconscious. Hughes later died as a result of a subarachnoid haemorrhage on 27 November, having never regained consciousness.

Since 2015, it is the venue where David Warner scored three consecutive centuries in Tests (2015–17). Steve Smith and Don Bradman scored four in a row at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. During the streak, he scored a century within the first session of the game in 2017 against Pakistan. He also scored a half century in the second innings. The half century streak continued to three when he scored a half century in the first innings of the final test in the 2017-18 Ashes series, but the century streak ended as Australia won by an innings, and was not required to bat again.

On 12 January 2019, Australia won the first ODI against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 34 runs, to record their 1,000th win in international cricket.

==Rugby league==

The SCG has hosted 1,392 top-level premiership rugby league games – more than any other ground in Australia (as of 2015), in addition to 70 Test matches and World Cup games. Between 1913 and 1987, the NSWRFL Premiership Final was always played at the SCG, unless circumstances dictated otherwise. Due to the ground&#x27;s historical significance to rugby league, it is often used for special heritage matches for National Rugby League club and representative matches. 
Rugby league was first played at the SCG on 22 June 1911 between Australia and New Zealand. The ground was first used by the New South Wales Rugby Football League in 1913. At this time the Trust only gave players access to dressing sheds in the Sheridan Stand and did not allow use of the rooms in the Members&#x27; Stand. This rule was relaxed in 1918. The 1915 NSWRFL season&#x27;s first round match between defending premiers South Sydney and Glebe was played in front of a record crowd of 13,000.

The 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw the British rugby league team tour Australia for the first time since World War I and huge crowds attended their games. The first match of the tour was at the SCG against Metropolis in front of nearly 68,000 spectators. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane and in the second Test at the SCG on 3 July. The Australians sealed the series, scoring five tries to win 21–8 and secure the Ashes series for the first time at home.

The attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England in the first test of the 1932 Ashes series at the Cricket Ground. It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold &#x27;V&#x27;, which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain Jim Sullivan (fullback), Alf Ellaby and Stan Smith (wings), and Artie Atkinson and Stan Brogden in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8–6. The second game was the famous &quot;Battle of Brisbane&quot; Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11–3 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18–13) and the series. The attendance of the first test stood as the highest recorded crowd for an international rugby league match until 73,631 fans attended the 1992 World Cup final between Australia and Great Britain at the famous Wembley Stadium in London, England.

The next tour by England was in 1946, knows as The &quot;Indomitables&quot; tour due to the Great Britain team traveling to Australia on the Royal Navy&#x27;s Aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable. The first test played on 17 June was an 8 – 8 draw, the opening try of the series was scored by the legendary Frank Whitcombe for the tourists, in front of a crowd of 64,527. England went on to win The Ashes. In 1950 Australia had not won a series against the team Lions for 30 years but this time there was a big change. Britain had won the first Test and Australia the second, which made the third SCG Test the decider. The tour coincided with a record amount of rain and by the time the teams arrived the SCG was a mud heap. Forty tonnes of soil were brought in and spread over the surface to try and dry it out. Tied 2–2 at half time, Australia scored the only try of the match late in the second half when winger Ron Roberts crossed in the corner to seal the win. At the end of the game the crowd of over 47,000 jumped the fence and invaded the field and congregated in front of the Members&#x27; Stand cheering and calling for Aussie captain Clive Churchill.

The 1963 NSWRFL Grand Final was won by the St George Dragons 8–3 in front of 69,860 fans in atrocious conditions. It was the Dragons eighth consecutive premiership and their third consecutive grand final win against the Western Suburbs Magpies. The match&#x27;s only try, scored by Dragons winger Johnny King, was clouded in controversy after he appeared to be tackled when a defender knocked him flat on the ground, only to get up and carry the ball to the try line under howls of protest from Wests players who believe that the referee had called King to play the ball. That try became the centre of furore when rumours spread that match referee Darcy Lawler had bet on St. George to win (Wests captain Arthur Summons later claimed one of his players announced to his teammates before the game that any who had bet on the Magpies to win had better lay off their bets as referee Lawler had backed St. George). After the match, photographer John O&#x27;Gready took the iconic rugby league photograph, &quot;The Gladiators&quot;, depicting Arthur Summons supporting St. George captain Norm Provan. The photo of Summons and Provan was later used as the basis for the Winfield Cup trophy, and continues to be used to this day with the National Rugby League&#x27;s Telstra Premiership Trophy.

On 18 September 1965, the largest ever official crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the South Sydney Rabbitohs 12–8 in the NSWRFL grand final. Gates were ordered to be closed two hours before the game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate that many more – perhaps thousands – gained other means of access and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the Sydney Showground (Moore Park) and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series when 87,161 attended the game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the grand final, the New South Wales Police Force imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.

The SCG hosted the 1968 Rugby League World Cup final, won 20–2 by the Johnny Raper led Australians over France in front of 54,290. The Australian team that day, coached by Harry Bath, boasted legends of the Australian game in Raper (Lock), Eric Simms (Fullback), Graeme Langlands and Johnny Greaves (centres), Bob Fulton (Five-eighth), Billy Smith (halfback), Arthur Beetson (prop) and Dick Thornett and Ron Coote (second-row). Although the Final attracted over 54,000 fans, this was actually not the highest attendance of the 1968 World Cup. That came during the opening game of the tournament when 62,256 saw Australia defeat Great Britain 25–10. This would stand as the highest attendance for a World Cup match until 73,631 attended the 1992 World Cup final to see Australia again defeat Great Britain 10–6 at the famous Wembley Stadium in London.

One of the most courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler&#x27;s performance in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South&#x27;s captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates not to take the field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.

The Cricket Ground hosted what many consider to be the toughest grand final of all in 1973 when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, who were playing in their first ever grand final after joining the competition in 1967. The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback Tommy Bishop and had a forward pack led by his tough St. Helens and GB teammate Cliff Watson and 1973 Rothmans Medallist Ken Maddison, along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre Steve Rogers. Manly were coached by Ron Willey and captained by tough hooker Freddy Jones, and could boast internationals Ken Irvine, Ray Branighan, Bob Fulton, John O&#x27;Neill, British lock Malcolm Reilly, as well as tough tackling second-row forward Terry Randall and 19-year-old fullback Graham Eadie. From the opening kick off the game descended into a series of high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page did not send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minutes of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by Cronulla hooker Ron &quot;Rocky&quot; Turner well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly out of sorts football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, the difference between the two teams was Manly&#x27;s international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10–7 win. The game was described by Sunday Telegraph writer Ian Heads as &quot;A grand final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl&quot;.

In 1975, in one of the most memorable grand finals ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, Jack Gibson coached Eastern Suburbs Roosters, defeated St. George 38–0 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the 2008 NRL Grand Final played between Manly Warringah and the Melbourne Storm, Manly winning by the tune of 40–0. However, the game was famous for reasons other than the scoreline. St George&#x27;s Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback Russell Fairfax and centre Mark Harris, and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void – John Rheinberger – who played in his first only first grade game in the grand final. Leading by only 5–0 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club – 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters&#x27; eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.

The SCG hosted its second Rugby League World Cup final in 1977. On 25 June Australia defeated Great Britain 13–12 in front of just 24,457 fans. The match was highlighted by a 60-metre try to Manly-Warringah centre Russel Gartner who outpaced the Lions chasers late in the first half to give Australia an 8–5 lead. This would prove to be (as of 2016) the last World Cup game played at the SCG.

In 1981, another memorable and emotional rugby league grand final was played at the SCG. Since joining the Sydney Premiership in 1947, the Parramatta Eels had not won a grand final. In 1976 and 1977 it had suffered consecutive losses, first to Manly-Warringah (who also joined the league in 1947) and then St George in the first replayed grand final. In 1981, the Eels &#x27;dream team&#x27; (another team coached by Jack Gibson), comprising internationals Ray Price, Mick Cronin, Ron Hilditch and Bob &quot;The Bear&quot; O&#x27;Reilly, as well as budding stars Peter Sterling, Brett Kenny, Steve Ella, Eric Grothe and John Muggleton, outscored the Tommy Raudonikis captained Newtown four tries to three to win 20–11 and secure their first premiership. Playing second-row for Newtown that day was future dual grand final winning, and NSW State of Origin coach Phil Gould. Financial pressures at the Newtown club would result in the Jets competing in the New South Wales Rugby League first grade competition for only two seasons following their 1981 grand final appearance.

The 1986 NSWRL Grand Final at the SCG between the John Monie coached Parramatta and defending premiers Canterbury-Bankstown, coached by Warren Ryan, and played in front of one of the smallest grand final crowds in years (45,843), would go down as the lowest scoring and only try-less grand final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4–2 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), at the time the record number of points scored in a career.

The last rugby league grand final played at the Cricket Ground was the 1987 decider between the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Canberra Raiders, who had joined the premiership in 1982. In front of 50,201 fans on an unseasonably warm day in Sydney, the Sea Eagles ran out 18–8 winners, scoring two tries to one with dual rugby international Michael O&#x27;Connor scoring 14 of Manly&#x27;s points with a try and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Manly&#x27;s other try scorer that day, Five-eighth Cliff Lyons won the Clive Churchill Medal as the man of the match.

The ground lost the grand final and numerous games to the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in 1988. Even so, between 1988 and 2018 the ground continued to host occasional National Rugby League matches, mostly featuring the Heritage round game between St George Illawarra and South Sydney and the 2008 Centenary ANZAC Test between Australia and New Zealand, in what was the first test held at the famous old ground since the Wally Lewis captained Australians had defeated the Kiwis 29–12 on 19 July 1986 in front of 34,302 fans. The 2008 Kangaroos, kitted out in replica 1908 jumpers depicting the colours of NSW and Qld, ran out 28-12 winners in front of 34,571 fans, the largest Test crowd in Sydney since the first Ashes test of the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour when 40,141 attended Game 1 at the SFS.

Regular rugby league action returned to the SCG on 16 March 2019 with the Sydney Roosters calling the SCG home after the Sydney Football Stadium was demolished to make way for the new Sydney Football Stadium on the site. The Anzac Day clash between St George Illawarra and the Sydney Roosters will also be held at the SCG while the Roosters call the cricket ground home. The Roosters also played two home games at the SCG against the Melbourne Storm and Manly Warringah in 2023 due to the Sydney Football Stadium being used for the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

===State of Origin===
The Cricket Ground hosted six State of Origin series games from 1982–1987

==Tennis==
In 1885 the first inter-colonial tennis match was held at the SCG when Victoria played New South Wales although forms of the game were no doubt played in Australia from its colonial beginnings. All colonies of Australia were well established when the final versions of the rules of the game were codified by the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1875 and by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1877 when it held its first tournament at Wimbledon.

Tennis was regularly played at the SCG in the early days. The Sydney tournament which was to become the New South Wales Open, was first played at the SCG in 1885 before moving to the NSW Lawn Tennis Club&#x27;s courts at Double Bay, then to White City and later to the Olympic Tennis Centre at Homebush Bay. The SCG was the host of the 1908 Australasian Championships.

==Motor racing==
In 1898, Sydney cycle firm, Gavin Gibson Ltd, imported seven motorised tricycles produced by Count Jules-Albert de Dion and powered by one cylinder petrol engines designed by his partner Georges Bouton. On the evening of 1 January 1901, these seven machines raced around the concrete cycle track which ringed the inside of the SCG in those days to compete in Australia&#x27;s first ever motor race.

==Empire Games==

The SCG was the main stadium for the 1938 British Empire Games which were tied into the State&#x27;s sesqui-centenary celebrations. Perhaps because of this the Federal Government provided no money and only £10,000 came from the State Government to cover the organising committee&#x27;s administrative costs. The budget was therefore, very tight and using the existing SCG was one way of making ends meet. Cyclist Edgar &quot;Dunc&quot; Gray led the teams onto the ground and athletes ran on a makeshift grass track.

==Rugby union==
Club rugby was first played at the then Civil and Military Ground as early as 1870, and the first inter-colonial game was played there in 1882. NSW beat Queensland 28–4. From June 1911 the NSW Rugby League had exclusive use of the SCG, as well as the Sydney Sports Ground and the Sydney Showground, preventing rugby union games from being played there. Over the years the SCG hosted 71 rugby union tests before Sydney international matches were moved first to Waratah Rugby Park (Concord Oval), then the Sydney Football Stadium and later Stadium Australia. The largest ever crowd to watch a rugby union match at the SCG was 49,327 who saw NSW played New Zealand on 13 July 1907. 

Of those 71 tests none could have been more dramatic than the game against the South African Springboks on 7 August 1971. Marred by anti-apartheid protests, field invasions and objects being thrown onto the ground and halted several times to remove golf balls and protestors, it was won by South Africa who went through the tour undefeated.

The SCG has been both a happy and unhappy hunting ground for Australian rugby union. One of the worst incidents to occur there was the sad demise of Ken Catchpole&#x27;s international career. Robbed of a glorious retirement, his career ended in a disgraceful scandal. Australia was playing the New Zealand All Blacks and while Catchpole was trapped on the bottom of a ruck New Zealander second rower, Colin Meads, tried to drag him out by one leg, splitting him like a wishbone. Australia, although well beaten on this occasion, was well served by international-standard halfbacks and 20-year-old John Hipwell ran on for his first test as Catchpole was carried off. It was a sad end to an illustrious career.

Dramatic though that game was, no test could have been as important in the development of Australian Rugby Union than the game against the touring Welsh team in 1978.

The 1978 Welsh had arrived in Australia as (the then) Five Nations Champions, Triple Crown winners, the best rugby union team in the world but they were a sad and sorry bunch by the time they got to Sydney for the last game of the tour, the second test. The team was decimated by injuries and in two earlier tour games had suffered a last minute loss to Sydney and a humiliating defeat midweek to the Australian Capital Territory.

Rumours abounded that the Welsh were ready for a big &#x27;get square&#x27; with Australian prop Steve Finnane, the so-called &#x27;enforcer&#x27; of the Australian team. Finnane and other senior members of the team had vowed to avenge the defeat of the Australians by the Welsh on their last tour of the UK several years before. The SCG crowd did not have long to wait because after the very first scrum Welsh prop Graham Price came out holding his bloodied jaw, the victim of a Finnane punch. Price had bored in on Finnane, his opposite number in the front row and Finnane reacted.

After Price left the field and the game continued for a short while until the Welsh, using a pre-determined code word, sparked an all-in-brawl. Wales lost the test and the two-test series.

In 1979 there was a one-off game against the All Blacks at the SCG. The kicking of a young five-eighth named Tony Melrose closed out the New Zealanders and Australia won a try-less game 12–6, to take back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 1949. The following year the Australians showed it was no fluke by beating New Zealand two tests to one in Australia to successfully defend the trophy for the first time.

On 14 April 2018 the NSW Waratahs played a home game at the SCG against the Queensland Reds in the Waratahs first appearance at the ground in 35 years.

The Waratahs staged three of their home games in the 2019 Super Rugby season at the SCG while the Sydney Football Stadium was being rebuilt. In July 2022 the SCG staged a rugby union test for the first time since 1986 when Australia played England.

==Australian rules football==

The first Australian rules football match to be played at the SCG was Inter-Colonial football match played between Victoria and New South Wales on 6 August 1881.

Essendon and Melbourne played a premiership match at Moore Park in 1904 in front of the Governor General and Governor of NSW. Melbourne won and both teams had to return home by boat down the coast; two other matches (Fitzroy v Collingwood and Geelong v Carlton, which had been postponed) were also played there in 1903. In 1922, Port Adelaide played a combined New South Wales side on the ground.

In the subsequent decades, the ground was rarely used for Australian Rules, except for the occasional exhibition match or interstate football carnival.

Richmond played Collingwood there in 1952, and eight VFL matches were played there in 1979–1981, but Australian rules football was not to make a regular comeback to the SCG until 1982, when South Melbourne relocated to Sydney and made the SCG its home ground.

===Sydney Swans===

South Melbourne was formed in 1867, a foundation member of the first Australian rules competition the Victorian Football Association (VFA) and also its later replacement the Victorian Football League (VFL). The club won five premierships with the VFA up to 1890 and three more in the VFL in the first half of the 20th century, but a lack of success in the post-war years and serious financial troubles left them ripe for relocation when the game&#x27;s administrators were looking to expand the competition into other states.

In 1982 South Melbourne moved to Sydney and the SCG to become the Sydney Swans. Despite their shaky financial situation, the Swans were the flavour of Sydney in the early years; the Swans matches at the SCG were the place to be seen, rivaling Sydney&#x27;s main winter sport, rugby league. In the late 1980s Sydney Rules Ltd, the company which ran the licence for the club, recorded a profit of $600,000. However, when the stock market crashed in October 1987, the Swans went with it, but the Swans have since managed to hold on and have gained a foothold in Sydney.
The SCG most notably hosted Sydney&#x27;s preliminary final against in 1996, in which full forward Tony Lockett scored a behind after the final siren to give Sydney a one-point win, sending the Swans into their first grand final since 1945. Between 2003 and 2015, most Sydney Swans home finals had been played at the larger Stadium Australia unless it was otherwise booked. Since 2016, all Swans home finals (with the exception of a Sydney Derby in 2016) have been played at the SCG.

There have been two modern-day pitch invasions witnessed at the ground: first in 1999, when Tony Lockett kicked his 1300th career goal to become the highest goalkicker in VFL/AFL history, and second in 2022 when Lance Franklin kicked his 1000th career goal becoming only the sixth player to kick as many goals in VFL/AFL history.

On 9 September 2017, the largest ever crowd to watch an Australian Rules game at the SCG, 46,323, came to see the Swans defeat Essendon in an Elimination Final.

The SCG was the shortest field used for AFL games, at 153 metres long, but Geelong&#x27;s Kardinia Park is narrower. However recent works on the Northern Stand facilitated an extension of the playing surface means it is no longer the shortest ground in the league.

==Other sports==
The SCG has been a popular arena for a whole range of sports before the turn of the 20th century including cricket, tennis, baseball, soccer and cycling with athletics being staged there as early as 1879. On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1880, possibly some of the most exotic sports ever seen at the SCG were staged when the 12th Annual Highlands Games was held. Organised by the Scottish community events included tossing the caber, putting the stone and other traditional Highland sports as well as Highland dancing. A crowd of 5000 attended. On 5 May 1964, 51,566 soccer fans came to the SCG to see NSW take on English club Everton F.C. In 1974 the Socceroos defeated Uruguay 2–0 in front of a capacity crowd in a friendly match before the World Cup finals. It was announced in April 2018 that Sydney FC will stage 6 of their 13 home matches in the 2019-2020 A-League season with the other 7 games to be split between Jubilee Oval and Leichhardt Oval while the Sydney Football Stadium is demolished and rebuilt. Sydney FC played their first game at the SCG on 27 October 2018 against rivals Western Sydney Wanderers FC in front of 30,688 fans.

===US Major League Baseball – 22 and 23 March 2014===

In June 2013, Major League Baseball, the New South Wales Government, and the Sydney Cricket Ground announced that the season opening first two games of the 2014 MLB season would be played at the SCG between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles Dodgers, on Saturday 22 March (7pm AEST / 0800 UTC / 1am PDT) and Sunday 23 March (1pm AEST / 0200 UTC / 7pm PDT Saturday 22 March) 2014.
The Northern Stand was completed for the 2013–14 Ashes series, and provided the main stand behind home plate, with premium seating. The temporary outfield fence arced from the eastern Bill O&#x27;Reilly Stand (left field / third base line) and the western Brewongle Stand (right field / first base line). Two bullpens were positioned behind the outfield fence. Seating was restricted in the Victor Trumper Stand and the Clive Churchill Stand due to eye-line restrictions caused by the outfield fence and the need for a batter&#x27;s eye space in centre field. Its dimensions were to foul lines, to power alleys, and to centre field.

It was announced that due to the restricted seating the SCG&#x27;s capacity would be 38,000 for baseball. Game 1 of the series, won 3-1 by the Dodgers with the win going to their ace pitcher Clayton Kershaw, attracted 38,266 fans while Game 2, won 7-5 by the Dodgers, attracted 38,079 fans. As the games took place approximately one week before the normal season opening date, both the Diamondbacks and the Dodgers actually returned to their Spring Training schedules once the series ended.
Major League Baseball is a significant co-owner of the Australian Baseball League relaunched in 2010, and cooperates with the Australian Baseball Federation.

<text>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is a 1965 American exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer and co-written by Meyer and Jack Moran. It follows three go-go dancers who embark on a spree of kidnapping and murder in the California desert.

The film is known for its violence, provocative gender roles, and eminently quotable &quot;dialogue to shame Raymond Chandler&quot;. It is also remembered for the performance of star Tura Satana, whose character Richard Corliss called &quot;the most honest, maybe the one honest, portrayal in the Meyer canon&quot;. &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot; was a commercial and critical failure upon its initial release, but it has since become widely regarded as an important and influential film.
==Plot==
Three wild, uninhibited go-go dancers—Varla, Rosie, and Billie—dance at a club before racing their sports cars across the California desert. They play a high-speed game of chicken on the salt flats and encounter a young couple, Tommy and Linda, out to run a time trial. After breaking Tommy&#x27;s neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.

In a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-using old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was disabled in a railway accident, &quot;going nuts&quot; as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.

At the ranch, they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is known as &quot;The Vegetable&quot; due to his feeblemindedness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck. The younger son catches Linda and seems about to assault her, but he collapses in tears as Varla and Kirk arrive. Kirk finally acknowledges his father&#x27;s lecherous nature and the old man&#x27;s hold over his younger brother, and he vows to have his younger brother institutionalized. He tries to take the hysterical Linda into town in the truck, but the old man says that he has thrown away the keys, so Kirk and Linda set out across the desert on foot.

Varla drives back to the house and tells Billie and Rosie that they should kill the men and the girl to cover up Linda&#x27;s kidnapping and the murder of her boyfriend. Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive. Rosie and Varla hit the old man with their car, killing him and knocking over his wheelchair to reveal the money hidden inside. Rosie is stabbed to death by the younger son while trying to retrieve the knife from Billie&#x27;s body. Varla tries to ram him into a wall with her car, injuring him. She drives off in the truck and overtakes Kirk and Linda, chasing them into a gully. Varla and Kirk fight hand-to-hand. She gets the better of him until Linda hits her with the truck, and she dies. Kirk and Linda drive off together in the truck.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; was a follow-up to an earlier Meyer film. &quot;&#x27;We had just done a film called &quot;Motorpsycho&quot;, which was about three bad boys, and it had gone through the roof. So I said, &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s do one with three bad girls&#x27;.&quot;

The screenplay is credited to Jack Moran from an original story by Russ Meyer. The first draft was titled &quot;The Leather Girls&quot; and was written over a brief four-day period by Moran, who also collaborated with Meyer on &quot;Common Law Cabin&quot; and &quot;Good Morning and... Goodbye!&quot; The screenplay went through a second working title—&quot;The Mankillers&quot;—and had already begun production when the sound editor, Richard S. Brummer, came up with the now-immortal final title. Although neither Moran nor Meyer overtly cited any prior works as inspiration, the plot has been called a &quot;loose remake of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, or possibly &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;&quot; by one prominent film critic and a &quot;pop-art setting of Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Eumenides&quot;&quot; by one classical scholar.

===Casting===
Haji had worked with Meyer on &quot;Motorpsycho&quot;. She recommended Tura Satana to him.

Lori Williams later said, &quot;Russ didn&#x27;t want to hire me because he didn&#x27;t think I had a big enough bust! I said I could use pushups in my bra, which I did. He didn&#x27;t know whether it would work, but then in rehearsals he finally said okay. I kind of did my part like a cartoon, like the rest of the film, bigger than life.&quot;

===Filming===
&quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot; had a budget of approximately $45,000 and was shot in black and white in order to save money.

The film began shooting at the Pussycat Club, a strip club in Van Nuys, before moving on to the California desert later that night. The film&#x27;s early racing scene was shot on the dry salt flats of Cuddeback Lake, the gas station scene was filmed in the town of Randsburg, and the scenes at the Old Man&#x27;s house at Ollie Peche&#x27;s Musical Wells Ranch outside the town of Mojave. During principal photography, the cast and crew stayed at the Adobe Motel in Johannesburg.

Meyer, who got his start making films while serving in the US Army&#x27;s 166th Signal Photographic Company during World War II, had a reputation for running strictly regimented film shoots with a small crew composed largely of former Army buddies. Actor Charles Napier, who appeared in five of Meyer&#x27;s films, said that &quot;Working with Russ Meyer was like being in the first wave landing in Normandy during World War II.&quot; Meyer considered the &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot; shoot no different, saying &quot;It was the usual thing with me. It&#x27;s like being in the military. Everybody has to get up and do their jobs to get things together, and that&#x27;s it.&quot; Meyer&#x27;s directorial style and the rules he imposed upon cast and crew caused clashes with his equally strong-willed star, Tura Satana.

There was also friction between Susan Bernard and her director and co-stars, much of which they attributed to the presence of her mother on the set (necessitated by Bernard&#x27;s being a sixteen-year-old at the time). Bernard has said in interviews that she was truly scared of Satana, and some have thought that this contributed to her performance as a frightened kidnapping victim.

According to Satana,

===Music===
The film&#x27;s title song, &quot;Faster Pussycat!&quot;, was performed by California band the Bostweeds. The lyrics were written by Rick Jarrard and the music was written and sung by Lynn Ready, who formed the Bostweeds and sang leads. The track was never released commercially, but it did appear in February 1966 as a promotional-only 45 rpm single without a B-side.

==Reception and influence==
===Box office===
&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on August 6, 1965. Atypically for a Meyer film, it was a box office failure upon its initial release.

&quot;When it first came out, it was not successful&quot;, said Meyer. &quot;At the time, people didn&#x27;t understand that women could have a relationship with other women.&quot;

===Critical response===
It was generally dismissed as an exploitative &quot;skin flick&quot; by the few critics who took any note of it at all. John L. Wasserman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, for example, reviewed a double bill of &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot; and &quot;Mudhoney&quot; in April 1966, saying that &quot;&quot;Pussycat&quot; has the worst script ever written, and &quot;Mudhoney&quot; is the worst movie ever made.&quot;

===Cult status===
In the years since, the film has been regarded more favorably, gaining in both commercial and critical stature. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; is undoubtedly shlock, but director Russ Meyer&#x27;s infectious affection for camp gives this anarchic joyride exhilarating flair.&quot; In his review of the film&#x27;s 1995 re-release, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars. Noted feminist film critic B. Ruby Rich said that when she first saw &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot; in the 1970s she &quot;was absolutely outraged that [she had] been forced to watch this misogynist film that objectified women and that was really just short of soft-core porn.&quot; Upon viewing it again in the early 1990s, however, she &quot;just loved it&quot; and wrote a piece in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reappraising the film and discussing her change in opinion.

&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; is currently number 377th on the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; &quot;Greatest Films Poll&quot;. It is frequently mentioned on lists of the best B movies and cult films of all time.

The film has also been influential on other filmmakers. Writer-director John Waters stated in his book &quot;Shock Value&quot; that &quot;&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; is, beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made. It is possibly better than any film that will be made in the future.&quot; He later said on its re-release that &quot;it ages like fine wine.&quot; Music video director Keir McFarlane acknowledged that a scene in the video for the Janet Jackson song &quot;You Want This&quot; was a direct homage to &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot;, showing the Porsche-driving singer and her female companions driving circles around two men in the desert. The music video for &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; by Spice Girls was also inspired by this film. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino referenced the film and thanked Meyer in the credits of his film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, and it was reported in &quot;Variety&quot; in 2008 that Tarantino was interested in remaking &quot;Faster, Pussycat!&quot;

==Television adaptation==
In May 2021, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the film is in development from bigbaldhead Productions, the production company run by Norman Reedus, and AMC Studios.

==In popular culture==
* Audio samples from the film are featured in four songs by metal band White Zombie on their third album, &quot;La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One&quot;. The dialogue &quot;You&#x27;re all shook up, aren&#x27;t you, baby?&quot; and &quot;I never try anything, I just do it. Wanna try me?&quot; are used in the song &quot;Thunder Kiss &#x27;65&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re all shook up, aren&#x27;t you, baby?&quot; is also used in the song &quot;Cosmic Monsters, Inc.&quot; and the line &quot;Now let&#x27;s move, but let&#x27;s take the back door&quot; in the song &quot;Welcome to Planet Motherfucker/Psychoholic Slag&quot;. Another line, &quot;I work on this baby the same way, trying to get maximum performance&quot;, is used in &quot;Black Sunshine&quot;.
* The title of Daniel Clowes&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron&quot; is taken from a line in the film describing Varla.
* The film&#x27;s title song, &quot;Faster Pussycat!&quot;, has been covered several times, most notably by American punk band the Cramps on their 1983 live mini-album &quot;Smell of Female&quot;.
* The music video for the Janet Jackson song &quot;You Want This&quot; from her self-titled 1993 album &quot;Janet&quot; pays homage to the film and centers around Jackson as a female gang leader, with the singer and her friends encountering two men in a desert setting.
* The music video for the Spice Girls song &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; was inspired by the &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; film (and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;). The music video features the group members as female techno-warriors who use martial arts and ninja-influenced weapons to capture a hapless male, much like the film.
* In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, the character Shanna is wearing a T-shirt featuring Tura Satana&#x27;s character Varla with the words &quot;BADASS CINEMA&quot; underneath it. Meyer is also one of the directors Tarantino thanks in the end credits.
* Reference is made to a poster of the film in Amy Vincent&#x27;s 2008 teen novel (under the pen name Claudia Grey) &quot;Evernight&quot; (at page 134) on the dorm room door of one of the supporting characters.
* The three main antagonist characters in John Lee&#x27;s 2016 movie &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; were inspired by the film.
* &quot;Operation: Pussycat&quot;, a Japanese remake of the film directed by Ryûichi Honda, was released in 2005.
* The film &quot;Bitch Slap&quot; was inspired by the films of Russ Meyer, especially &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; Much like this film, it follows three female characters who travel to a desert location to find a treasure. The film&#x27;s opening and closing credits even have clips from &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; in a montage of clips from other B movies.

The film&#x27;s over-the-top title has become iconic and is frequently referenced or played upon in other popular culture:

* American glam metal band Faster Pussycat took their name from the film.
* American punk rock band Frightwig named their second album &quot;Faster, Frightwig, Kill! Kill!&quot; (1986). 
* The 2008 song &quot;Funplex&quot; by the B-52&#x27;s features the lyrics &quot;Faster pussycat, thrill thrill&quot;, an allusion to the film&#x27;s title.
* In the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episode &quot;Passion&quot;, Xander Harris encourages Buffy and the others to go after the vampire Angelus, saying &quot;If Giles wants to go after the, uh, fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, &#x27;Faster, pussycat, kill, kill&#x27;.&quot;
* An &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot; short entitled &quot;Foster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; is shown in the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily&quot;.
* The title of the hit 2006 single &quot;Faster Kill Pussycat&quot; by Paul Oakenfold featuring Brittany Murphy is a play on the title of the film.
* The Boston band Human Sexual Response used the title as the last line in their song, &quot;Blow Up&quot;, from the album &quot;In a Roman Mood&quot;.
* In the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars&quot;, there is a mission titled &quot;Faster Pusher Man! Sell! Sell!&quot; wherein the protagonist is tasked with peddling cocaine for motorcycle club &quot;The Angels of Death&quot;.
* The sixth episode of the CW series &quot;Riverdale&quot;, &quot;Faster Pussycats Kill Kill&quot; (2017), is titled after the film, the plural variation in reference to the series&#x27; characters and band, Josie and the Pussycats.
* The fifth episode of the Netflix animated series &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, &quot;Faster, Princess! Kill! Kill!&quot;, is titled after the film.
* In the Futurama episode &quot;The Thief of Baghead&quot;, Zoidberg exclaims &quot;Faster, professor! Kill! Kill!&quot;, a reference to the title.
* &quot;Halloween Pussy Trap Kill! Kill!&quot; (2017) was named as a homage to &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot;
* In &quot;Mad Heidi&quot; (2022), President Meili says; &quot;faster pussycat&quot;, with the audience chanting; &quot;kill&quot; with lead character fighting in gladiator games to the death.

<doc id="773502" wikidata="Q1211900" url="?curid=773502" title="The Chronicles of Prydain">
<text>The Chronicles of Prydain is a pentalogy of children&#x27;s high fantasy Bildungsroman novels written by American author Lloyd Alexander and published by Henry Holt and Company. The series includes: &quot;The Book of Three&quot; (1964), &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1965), &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; (1966), &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; (1967), and &quot;The High King&quot; (1968). &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; earned a 1966 Newbery Honor, and &quot;The High King&quot; won the 1969 Newbery Medal.

The five novels take place in Prydain, a fictional country ruled by a High King who oversees several minor kingdoms. The setting is based on Wales and inhabited by creatures and characters inspired by Welsh mythology and folklore. The series follows the protagonist Taran, a youth of unknown parentage living on a farm with an old enchanter named Dallben and a farmer named Coll. Taran, who dreams of being a great hero, is named &quot;Assistant Pig-Keeper&quot; and tasked with helping to care for and protect Hen Wen, a white oracular pig magically empowered with clairvoyance. Taran has a series of adventures wherein he helps protect the land of Prydain from various threats, chief among them the evil Arawn, whose forces include an undead army known as the Cauldron-Born. Throughout the novels, Taran&#x27;s major companions are the Princess Eilonwy, the bard Fflewddur Fflam, the wild beast-man Gurgi, and the dwarf Doli. The heroes frequently work alongside the Fair Folk (a society of elves and similar beings) and the warriors known as the Sons of Don. Along with various battles against forces of evil, the novels focus on Taran&#x27;s journey of maturity.

&quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; were accompanied by an illustrated short story book in 1965 and another in 1967, and were followed by &quot;The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain&quot;, a collection of six short stories published in 1973. The cover art for the novels and the interior art for the short story picture books was done by Evaline Ness. New illustrations for the 1973 anthology were done by Margot Zemach. The first two novels of &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; were loosely adapted into the 1985 Disney film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; and led to a video game of the same name produced by Sierra Entertainment.

==Inspiration and development==
During World War II, Lloyd Alexander received army combat intelligence training in Wales; he also became familiar with Welsh culture, geography, and language. He took particular interest in the country&#x27;s castles and folklore, explaining later that he was &quot;always interested in mythology.&quot; Alexander later described his experiences in Wales as &quot;part of the raw material for the Prydain books.&quot;

The magical land Prydain&#x27;s geography is loosely based on Wales. &quot;Ynys Môn&quot;, the Welsh name for the Isle of Anglesey, became the Isle of Mona. The word &quot;Prydain&quot; itself is the Welsh name of Britain, to which the word &quot;Britain&quot; is etymologically related.

The stories draw on themes, ideas, and culture inspired by Welsh folklore, particularly the stories collected in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. According to Alexander, nearly all of the proper names in Prydain are from Welsh myth or history, with the exceptions of Eilonwy and Taran. The author&#x27;s note in the first novel, &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, points out the Prydain stories and characters are his own and not simply retellings of old folklore, adding that students of Welsh culture should be prepared to see familiar names such as Arawn and Gwydion attached to characters who act very differently from their mythological namesakes. In the author&#x27;s note for &quot;The Castle of Lyr&quot;, Alexander said &quot;The Prydain Chronicles&quot; are meant to communicate &quot;the feeling, not the fact, of the land of Wales and its legends.&quot; In the author&#x27;s note for &quot;The High King&quot;, Alexander said of the series, &quot;While it grew from Welsh legend, it has broadened into my attempt to make a land of fantasy relevant to the world of reality.&quot;

Originally, Alexander planned to write only one or two Prydain novels, &quot;three at the very most.&quot; At one point, the plan was for a trilogy of books that would be entitled &quot;The Battle of the Trees&quot;, &quot;The Lion with the Steady Hand&quot;, and &quot;Little Gwion&quot;. By 1965, a four novel series was planned with new titles. The first novel, &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, was released by Holt and Company in 1964, followed by &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; in 1965, and &quot;The Castle of Lyr&quot; in 1966. Originally, the fourth novel was meant to be titled &quot;The High King of Prydain&quot;. But as Alexander finished &quot;The Castle of Lyr&quot;, an editor remarked that it felt as if some material was missing between the third and fourth volumes. To act as a bridge between the two and show more of Taran&#x27;s journey to maturity, Alexander started writing a new novel &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;, finishing it one month after &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; was published in 1966. The new book &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; was published in 1967. The next novel, entitled &quot;The High King&quot;, was published in 1968, concluding the now five-volume series. &quot;The High King&quot; included a map illustrated by Evaline Ness, who also did the cover art for the original novel editions.

While writing the series, Lloyd Alexander also published short stories taking place in Prydain, occurring before the events of the novels. This included &quot;Coll and His White Pig&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Truthful Harp&quot; (1967), both being 32-page picture books illustrated by Evaline Ness.

&quot;The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain&quot; was published in 1973 as a collection of six new short stories of Prydain, illustrated by Margot Zemach, with a reproduction of a map from &quot;The High King&quot; illustrated by Evaline Ness. It was dedicated to &quot;Friends of Prydain, who promised to read more if I would write more.&quot; In the collection, Alexander remarked &quot;popular demand makes a splendid pretext&quot; for a return to the fictional world of Prydain but not for covering the same ground, hence his decision to make the stories prequels.

&quot;The Prydain Chronicles&quot; Omnibus (1991) comprises the five novels and the material of the original edition of &quot;The Foundling&quot;, but not the stories of the first two illustrated picture books.

In 1999, Holt and Company published an expanded edition of &quot;The Foundling&quot; that included the original book&#x27;s material while adding the short stories (but not the illustrations) of &quot;Coll and his White Pig&quot; and &quot;The Truthful Harp&quot;, along with a new &quot;Prydain Pronunciation Guide&quot; with entries for 49 proper names. The Pronunciation Guide was included in later editions of the main five novels, as was Ness&#x27;s map.

In 1999, Alexander explained to Scholastic students: &quot;&quot;The High King&quot; was the final logical development of the first four books in the Prydain Chronicles. It was not an easy book to write, but at least I was building on a foundation that I had already made. I never considered a different ending...&quot; He added that after writing &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; for seven years, &quot;the characters were as close to me as my own family... I wept at the end – to see Taran confronted with such a brutally difficult decision.&quot;

==Setting==
Once ruled over by the evil sorceress Queen Achren, Prydain is now under the authority of the just High King, a member of the family known as the Children of Don, descendants of Lady Don and her consort, Belin. The High King and his warriors, known as the Sons of Don, are based in the stronghold called Caer Dathyl. The rest of Prydain is divided into territories and minor kingdoms (called cantrevs) ruled by many lower kings who owe their loyalty to the High King. A collection of villages called the Free Commots exist outside any cantrev&#x27;s jurisdiction, answering only to the High King.

The evil Queen Achren was overthrown by her consort and student in magic, Arawn. Taking the Iron Crown, Arawn became master of the fortress of Annuvin, the Land of the Dead. Known as the Death-Lord, Arawn&#x27;s warriors include the &quot;Cauldron-Born&quot; (undead soldiers reanimated by the magical Black Cauldron), the fearsome war commander called the Horned King, and the bloodthirsty Huntsmen of Annuvin (who in death transfer their power to their surviving comrades). Arawn also corrupts a race of birds into the Gwythaints, monstrous airborne agents. When the first novel begins, Arawn and the Horned King are making new plans to conquer Prydain.

Underneath and within Prydain is the kingdom of the Fair Folk, a society of diminutive supernatural beings that use magic to stay hidden and mostly keep to their own affairs. Having no love for Arawn, the Fair Folk occasionally aid the humans of Prydain against him.

Significant locations in Prydain include: Caer Dallben, the simple home of series protagonist Taran, his mentor Dallben, and the retired warrior Coll; Caer Colur, which stands near the Isle of Mona and is the ancestral home of the House of Llyr; The Spiral Castle, fortress of the sorceress Achren; Annuvin, fortress of Arawn; and the Marshes of Morva, a haunted swamp inhabited by the witches Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch.

In addition to the races of humans and Fair Folk, Prydain is home to many strange creatures, such as the odd forest man called Gurgi.

=== Novels ===

====&quot;The Book of Three&quot; (1964)====
Taran, a young boy in his early or mid-teens, lives with his mentor Dallben, a 379 year old enchanter, and the aged farmer and retired warrior Coll, son of Collfrewr. Named &quot;Assistant Pig-Keeper,&quot; Taran is charged with caring for Hen Wen, a magical white pig. Quickly losing the pig and following it into a forest, Taran meets Prince Gwydion, son of the High King of Prydain, who hopes to consult the white pig&#x27;s prophetic visions. After befriending a creature called Gurgi, Taran is captured by the &quot;Cauldron-Born,&quot; the undead warriors of the Horned King. Escaping imprisonment, Taran finds the legendary sword Dyrnwyn and befriends Eilonwy, a princess from a family of enchantresses, and Fflewddur Fflam, a king by birth who chooses to be a bard. Together, the new companions (later joined by a dwarf named Doli) determine to stop the plans of the Horned king and his master Arawn, Lord of the Land of Death.

====&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1965)====
A little over one year after the events of &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, Prince Gwydion has called allies to a council hosted by Dallben. Men are disappearing while more undead Cauldron-Born join the forces of Arawn. Taran and companions embark on a mission to capture the Black Cauldron and stop the creation of more undead warriors. They encounter three witches in the Marshes of Morva, and battle the Huntsmen of Annuvin, fearsome warriors who can lend each other their strength and power.

&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; won a Newbery Honor in 1966.

==== &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; (1966) ====
Eighteen months after the end of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, Eilonwy of the House of Llyr is encouraged to go to the royal court of the Isle of Mona so she may continue her education as a proper princess. During her journey, she befriends Prince Rhun. Later on, she is kidnapped, leading Taran, Rhun and others to embark on a rescue mission. During the adventure, the companions learn more of Eilonwy&#x27;s magical heritage and find the ruins of her ancestral home.

==== &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot; (1967) ====
Three years after &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;, Taran is in love with Eilonwy but afraid he can never marry her if he is of common birth. In the hopes that he might have some noble blood in him, he searches for the truth about his parentage. Meanwhile, a human wizard named Morda is raiding the underground realms of the Fair Folk. While journeying among the cantrevs and commots of Prydain, Taran increases his knowledge in a variety of skills, maturing greatly along the way and gaining new confidence in himself.

==== &quot;The High King&quot; (1968) ====
Days after the conclusion of &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;, the young man Taran returns home and learns that Eilonwy has returned from the Isle of Mona, now ruled by King Rhun. Servants of Arawn assault the warrior Gwydion and seize the magical black sword Dyrnwyn. Taran and his companions join other forces of Prydain in a great effort to defeat Arawn once and for all.

&quot;The High King&quot; won the prestigious Newbery Medal for children&#x27;s literature in 1969.

===Short stories===
&quot;Coll and His White Pig&quot; (1965). A 32-page picture book written by Alexander and illustrated by Evaline Ness. The book features Coll as a younger man, years before he meets Taran.

It was dedicated to &quot;Friends of Prydain, who promised to read more if I would write more.&quot; All six stories explore a time &quot;before the birth of Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper,&quot; meaning they take place at least fifteen years before the events of the first novel. An expanded edition was published in 1999, adding the original two short stories &quot;Coll and his White Pig&quot; and &quot;The Truthful Harp&quot;, but not including the illustrations Ness made for those picture books.

===Omnibus===
&quot;The Prydain Chronicles Omnibus&quot; (1991) comprises the five novels and the six later short stories, but not the stories of the first two illustrated picture books. Each novel includes a Prydain map by Evaline Ness (original illustrator of the picture books and covers of the novels) and each story includes the illustrations by Margot Zemach for the original &quot;Foundling and Other Tales&quot;.

===References===
In 1989, Greenwood Publishing Group published &quot;The Prydain Companion: A Reference Guide to Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s Prydain Chronicles&quot; by children&#x27;s literature scholar Michael O. Tunnell. Henry Holt, the original publisher of the Prydain books, republished &quot;The Prydain Companion&quot; in 2003. The book&#x27;s title is a reference to the fact that the Chronicles&#x27; narration often refers to any present combination of the main characters as &quot;the companions.&quot; &quot;The Prydain Companion&quot; includes a biographical sketch of Alexander and two sections by Alexander, the &quot;Foreword&quot; and &quot;How to Use the Companion.&quot; Entries cover major characters, locations, and so on, with insight gained by Tunnell&#x27;s interviews with Alexander as well as research into the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; and &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. One marketing capsule is &quot;An informative resource for formal studies of the Prydain Chronicles, as well as an excellent opportunity to delve into the fantastic workings of Prydain.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
Walt Disney Productions released a Prydain animated film in 1985. &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; is based primarily on the first two novels while incorporating elements from the others. The movie had a production budget of $44 million, while its theatrical release grossed only $21 million in the United States. The film received mixed reviews from critics who found the film &quot;pretty, but confusing and overly somber&quot; due to its dark nature and disjointed script, though Roger Ebert gave it a positive review. Production delays and its disappointing box office performance put the future of the Disney animation studio department in jeopardy. Then newly appointed studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg was dismayed by the product, and the animators felt that it lacked &quot;the humor, pathos, and the fantasy which had been so strong in Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s work. The story had been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and it was heartbreaking to see such wonderful material wasted.&quot;

Of the film, Lloyd Alexander remarked: &quot;First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable.&quot;

On March 17, 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures had re-acquired the film rights to &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;, with the intention to adapt the book series into an epic live-action motion picture series, more attuned to Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s high fantasy world. The project was said to be in early development at the Walt Disney Studios with no director, producer, or screenwriter attached yet.

===Audiobook===
Early in the 2000s, Listening Library (Random House) produced an unabridged reading by James Langton of the five main volumes, with author&#x27;s notes read by Lloyd Alexander himself. The audiobooks were published on compact audio cassette and compact disc, and were also released for download from 2004 to 2005. In May 2017, an audiobook adaptation of &quot;The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain&quot; was released in a digital format. This edition was also read by James Langton.

==Reception==
Having garnered a Newbery Medal and a Newbery Honor, &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; series is widely recognized as a valuable contribution to children&#x27;s literature. Ruth Hill Viguers wrote in the 1969 &quot;Critical History of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;Like most good fantasies, the books are related to humanity; the characters have failings but also the potential for greatness.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;The Book of Three&quot; was ranked #18, and &quot;The High King&quot; #68, among the all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience.

==Characters==
&quot;Characters are grouped by the book in which they first appear.&quot;

===&quot;The Book of Three&quot;===
Taran, Assistant Pig-Keeper. The main protagonist of &quot;The Prydain Chronicles&quot;, he is a young man who grows from early adolescence to adulthood over the course of the series. Initially defensive, quick-tempered, and impulsive, he matures over the series and makes it a point to improve himself and increase his knowledge. His true parentage a mystery, Taran is mentored by the ancient enchanter Dallben and the two live together in Caer Dallben at a farm owned by the warrior-turned-farmer Coll. Initially unsatisfied with his life as a farmhand, Taran longs to be a hero who finds glory in adventures. By the end of the first book, he reconsiders this opinion and realizes he is happiest living a simple life on the farm Caer Dallben and wants to remain there. Despite this, he is later called back to adventure again.

Dallben. When first introduced in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, he is already 379 years old. Living on Coll&#x27;s farm in Caer Dallben, he acts as the protector and mentor of Taran and helps protect the prophetic pig Hen Wen. Some recognize him as the most powerful enchanter in Prydain, and while his displays of power are quite potent, they are used sparingly.

Coll. A retired warrior of great skill, Coll now lives in his farm in Caer Dallben, acting as caretaker for the oracular pig Hen Wen. On meeting the enchanter Dallben, he allows the ancient man and Taran to take up residence at the farm. When Taran is in his mid-teens, Coll passes many of Hen Wen&#x27;s responsibilities to him, naming the boy &quot;Assistant Pig-Keeper.&quot;

Hen Wen. A white oracular pig, blessed with the ability to prophesy future events and reveal hidden information. Hen Wen originally belongs to a simple farmer but the Death-Lord Arawn learns of her oracular power and captures her. She suffers for some time as a prisoner in the dark fortress Annuvin. The warrior Coll eventually journeys into Annuvin alone and rescues the pig, becoming her caretaker. When Coll retires, he keeps her on his farm. Taran and Dallben help look after her after they take residence at the farm. When Taran is a teenager, Coll jokingly bestows on him the official title of Assistant Pig-Keeper. Hen Wen is lost at the beginning of &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, which causes a chain of events that puts Taran on the path of becoming a hero.

Princess Eilonwy. A princess of the House of Llyr, the women of whom are formidable enchantresses. She befriends Taran in the first book and over the years they develop romantic feelings for each other. Eilonwy is the daughter of Angharad, who in turn is the daughter of Regat. Against her mother&#x27;s wishes, Angharad married a commoner named Geraint, Eilonwy&#x27;s father. Smart and witty, she is also considered by some to be scatterbrained. She often employs unusual similes and metaphors. She prefers to go barefoot, and usually prefers sandals if she must wear shoes. She carries with her the Golden Pelydryn, a magical bauble that has been in her family for generations.

Fflewddur Fflam, son of Godo. A cantrev lord of Prydain, he is a minor king of a tiny kingdom. With few responsibilities and believing his people get along fine without him, he often leaves his kingdom, preferring to wander as a bard. Although prone to boasting, the strings of his enchanted &quot;truthful harp&quot; break whenever he tells a lie, sometimes forcing him to be honest.

Gurgi. A good-natured and &quot;ever hungry&quot; being who is both man and beast. He has long arms and is covered with fur and leaves. Often referring to himself in the third person, his manner of speech is filled with rhymed pairs of words (&quot;crunchings and munchings&quot;, &quot;smackings and wackings&quot;, &quot;sneakings and peekings&quot;), and redundant phrases (&quot;see with lookings&quot;). Gurgi is humble and loyal toward his human companions, at first submitting even to Taran as a &quot;noble lord&quot;. In the course of the &quot;Chronicles&quot;, he plays a highly important role by accidentally finding hidden items which ultimately occupy a vital role in the stories.

Doli. One of the Fair Folk, a society of magical beings who live in an extensive underground kingdom spanning the entire country of Prydain. Doli is described as a short, stocky dwarf who carries a number of weapons and is adept in hunting, fighting, and stealth. Originally, he is said to be the only one of his kin who does not have the power to turn himself invisible. After aiding Taran&#x27;s companions and the House of Don in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, he is rewarded by Gwydion with invisibility, although each use causes an uncomfortable sensation inside his ears.

King Eiddileg. The reclusive leader of the Fair Folk. He aids Taran and his allies in numerous battles against the forces of Annuvin.

Gwydion. Prince of Don, heir of King Math of Prydain. He is the war leader of the House of Don against the forces of Annuvin, and rides a horse named Melyngar. After meeting Taran in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, he befriends the young man and accompanies him on several adventures.

Math, son of Mathonwy. The High King of Prydain, Math rules above all lesser kings in the country and is the patriarch of the Royal House of Don, the descendants of the Lady Don and her consort, Belin, the Sun king. A just ruler, Math&#x27;s leadership helps keep Arawn the Death-Lord partly in check. He dwells in the stronghold Caer Dathyl, the castle of the Children of Don that lies north of the Eagle Mountains.

The Horned King. For a time, he is Arawn&#x27;s champion and the war leader of the Death-Lord&#x27;s forces. He is described as a huge man wearing armor, except for his arms, which are naked and stained crimson. Along with this, he wears a red cape and an antlered skull mask.

Achren. The former Queen of Prydain, her tyrannical rule was ended by her former consort and student Arawn, who took the Iron Crown from her. Living as Arawn&#x27;s subject in the Spiral Castle, she despises the Death-Lord and makes her own plans to take over Prydain, while finding herself drawn to and protective of the noble warrior Gwydion.

Arawn, the Death-Lord. The main antagonist of the series, Arawn is originally a mortal man. He gains magical powers by being tutored by the evil Queen Achren during her time as ruler of Prydain. After growing powerful as her consort, Arawn overthrows Achren and takes the Iron Crown from her. After gaining possession of the Black Cauldron, he creates a powerful undead army known as the Cauldron-Born. He then attempts to conquer Prydain, often defied by the Sons of Don.

===&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;===
King Smoit. The boisterous lord of Cantrev Cadiffor and one of the only Southern Cantrevs to remain loyal to the High King.

King Morgant. Ruler of the kingdom of Madoc.

Gwystyl. One of the Fair Folk, described as resembling &quot;a bundle of sticks with cobwebs floating at the top.&quot; Gwystyl lives in a hidden underground waypost near the border of Annuvin. He has a pet crow, named Kaw, whom he later passes to Taran.

Kaw. A crow, originally the pet of Gwystyl before being given to Taran. Kaw can talk, although only in one-word statements. He has a mischievous temperament, often playing tricks on his human friends and talking more freely than he should.

Ellidyr. Described as a prince whose father left him only &quot;his name and his sword,&quot; he is deeply sensitive about his poverty.

Adaon. A gifted minstrel, warrior, and healer with a distinctive brooch that bestows prophetic dreams.

Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch. Three witches who live alone in the Marshes of Morva, apparently inspired by the Norns of folklore. Although their identities seem fluid and interchangeable, each persona has a distinctive appearance: Orwen wears a necklace of milky stones, Orddu&#x27;s hair is adorned with many ornaments, and Orgoch&#x27;s face is shadowed by a black cowl. They were the original owners of the Black Cauldron and lent it to Arawn, who used it to create the Cauldron-Born. They trade information and advice to anyone brave enough to enter their domain, though they nearly always ask for a magical price. Many years ago, they acted as guardians of Dallben when they found him as an abandoned infant near the marsh.

The Huntsmen of Annuvin. A band of wild, merciless fighters notorious for their endurance, tenacity, and bloodthirst. They serve in Arawn&#x27;s army, each branded with the mark of Annuvin on their foreheads. When one is slain, his strength is magically transferred to his nearby comrades, making each stronger as their numbers dwindle.

===&quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;===
Prince Rhun. The only son of King Rhuddlum and Queen Teleria, who rule over the Isle of Mona. Cheerful and altruistic, he is also clumsy and accident-prone, with others believing he must mature before taking the throne. He is first introduced in &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot; when the Princess Eilonwy is sent by the enchanter Dallben to live at the castle and gain a &quot;proper&quot; upbringing.

Chief Steward Magg. A respected man on the Isle of Mona, he becomes increasingly power-hungry and focused on his own desires.

Glew. Resentful of his diminutive stature, Glew turns to magical potions to increase his physical size, first testing it on a wild cat. Prone to self-pity and desperation, he later works to improve his personality rather than his body.

Llyan. A female cat with orange fur that becomes larger than a horse due to an experimental growth potion created by Glew. Later won over by Fflewddur&#x27;s music, she serves as his steed.

===&quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;===
Aeddan. A farmer who shelters Taran while he searches for his parents.

Dorath. A treacherous bandit and mercenary. His unofficial second-in-command is the bandit Gloff.

Craddoc. An old shepherd who claims a connection to Taran.

Llonio, son of Llonwen. Unusually lucky, he and his family spend their days waiting for whatever comes their way.

Hevydd the Smith. An expert metalsmith who teaches sword forging to Taran.

Dwyvach the Weaver-Woman. An expert weaver who teachers her skills to Taran.

Annlaw Clay-Shaper. An expert potter from Commot Merin who teaches pottery to Taran. Taran later considers Annlaw to be the wisest of his Commot teachers.

Llassar, son of Drudwas. Young and enthusiastic to prove himself as a man, he is a mirror image of Taran in his own younger years. His knowledge of mountain craft proves vital.

Morda. An evil sorcerer who wishes to attain ultimate power.

===&quot;The High King&quot;===
King Pryderi, son of Pwyll. King of the Western Realms, he becomes increasingly convinced that only extreme measures will bring order to Prydain.

<doc id="773534" wikidata="Q420047" url="?curid=773534" title="Connexon">
<text>In biology, a connexon, also known as a connexin hemichannel, is an assembly of six proteins called connexins that form the pore for a gap junction between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. This channel allows for bidirectional flow of ions and signaling molecules. The connexon is the hemichannel supplied by a cell on one side of the junction; two connexons from opposing cells normally come together to form the complete intercellular gap junction channel. In some cells, the hemichannel itself is active as a conduit between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, allowing the transference of ions and small molecules lower than 1-2 KDa. Little is known about this function of connexons besides the new evidence suggesting their key role in intracellular signaling. In still other cells connexons have been shown to occur in mitochondrial membranes and appear to play a role in heart ischaemia.

Connexons made of the same type of connexins are considered homomeric, while connexons made of differing types of connexins are heteromeric.

==Structure==

===Assembly===
The assembly of connexins destined for gap junction plaques begins with synthesis of connexins within the cell and ends with the formation of gap junction channel plaques on the cell membrane. The connexin subunit proteins that make up connexons are synthesized on the membranes of the cell&#x27;s endoplasmic reticulum. These subunits are then oligomerized, or combined with other smaller parts, into connexons in the golgi apparatus. The connexons are then delivered to their proper location on the plasma membrane. Connexons then dock with compatible connexons from the neighboring cell to form gap junction channel plaques. A large part of this process is mediated by phosphorylation of different enzymes and proteins, allowing and preventing interaction between certain proteins. The connexons forming channels to the cell exterior or in mitochondria will require a somewhat altered path of assembly.

===General===
Connexons contribute to the formation of gap junctions, and are an essential component of the electric synapses in neural pathways. In a single gap junction, connexons will assemble around an aqueous porous membrane, forming a hemi-channel that is composed of connexins. Connexins are the smaller protein molecules that make up connexons and play a crucial part to the formation of gap junctions. Structurally, connexins are made up of 4 alpha helical transmembrane domains connected by two extracellular loops and one cytoplasmic loop, while both N and C terminals reside intracellularly. Connexin types can be further differentiated by using their predicted molecular weight (ex: Connexin 43 is Cx 43 due to its molecular weight of 43 kDa). Connexons will form the gap junction by docking a hemi-channel to another hemi-channel in an adjacent cell membrane. During this phase, the formation of intercellular channels spanning both of the plasma membranes occurs. Subsequently, this process leads to a better understanding of how electric synapses are facilitated between neurons.
Early research identified connexons through their presence in gap junctions. Since then, connexons have been increasingly detected forming channels in single membranes considerably broadening their functionality in cells and tissues.

===Degradation===
Connexon structure is degraded by its removal from the plasma membrane. Connexons will be internalized by the cell itself as a double membrane channel structure (due to the docking of hemi-channels). This is called internalization or endocytosis. Research suggests that gap junctions in general may be internalized using more than one method, but the best known and most studied would be that of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In simple terms this process consists of a ligand binding to a receptor signaling for a certain part of the membrane to be coated in clathrin. This part of the membrane then buds into the cell forming a vesicle. Now present in the cell membrane, connexons will be degraded by lysosomal pathways. Lysosomes are able to break down the proteins of the connexon because they contain specific enzymes that are made specifically for this process. It is thought that ubiquitination signals degradation within the cell.

==Cellular functions==

===Properties===
The properties of individual connexin proteins determine the overall properties of the whole connexon channel. The permeability and selectivity of the channels is determined by its width as well as the molecular selectivity of connexins such as charge selectivity. Research shows connexons are particularly permeable to soluble second messengers, amino acids, nucleotides, ions and glucose. Channels are also voltage sensitive. The connexon channels have voltage-dependent gates that open or close depending on the difference in voltage between the interiors of the two cells. Gates can also show voltage sensitivity depending on the difference in voltage from the interior and exterior of the cell (i.e. membrane potential).

===Modulation===
Communication between gap-junctions can be modulated/regulated in many ways. The main types of modulation are:
*Chemical – one common type of chemical modulation is through the interaction of Ca2+ and certain domains of connexins. It is not completely understood, however, it is suggested that this interaction causes Ca2+ to block the pore of the channel. Another form of chemical modulation is through the response of the channel to acidification (decrease of intracellular pH). It has been found that intracellular acidification causes a change in the C-terminal domain of connexins which then reduces the channel activity.
*Protein Phosphorylation – protein phosphorylation regulates the communication between channels in multiple ways by controlling: connexin trafficking from the Golgi Apparatus, accumulation of connexons to certain areas, and degradation of unnecessary channels. The process of these actions is very complex but involvement of protein phosphorylation is known.
*Humoral – humoral modulation of gap junction communication is done through many biomolecules such as neurotransmitters, growth factors, and various bioactive compounds. Neurotransmitters such as epinephrine and norepinephrine work in neuronal gap-junctions causing propagation of action potentials down neurons. These types of gap-junctions with this type of modulation are often found in neurons in cardiac tissue and vertebrate retina.

==Overall functions==
Connexons play an imperative role in behavior and neurophysiology. Many of the details surrounding their pathological functions remain unknown as research has only begun recently. In the central nervous system (CNS), connexons play a major role in conditions such as epilepsy, ischemia, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The molecular mechanism as to how connexons play a role in the conditions listed above has yet to be fully understood and is under further research. Along with their key role in the CNS, connexons are crucial in the functioning of cardiac tissues. The direct connection allows for quick and synchronized firing of neurons in the heart which explains the ability for the heart to beat quickly and change its rate in response to certain stimuli. Connexons also play an essential role in cell development. Specifically, their role in neurogenesis dealing with brain development as well as brain repair during certain diseases/pathologies and also assisting in both cell division as well as cell proliferation. The mechanism by which connexons aid in these processes is still being researched however, it is currently understood that this mechanism involves purinergic signaling (form of extracellular signaling mediated by purine nucleotides and nucleosides such as adenosine and ATP) and permeability to ATP. Other important roles of connexons are glucose sensing and signal transduction. Connexons cause changes in extracellular glucose concentrations affecting feeding/satiety behavior, sleep-wake cycles, and energy use. Further studies indicate that there is an increase in glucose uptake mediated by connexons (whose mechanism is still not fully understood) and under times of high stress and inflammation. Recent research also indicates that connexons may affect synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, vision, and sensorimotor gating.

==Related diseases==
Some of the diseases associated with connexons are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which is the inability of the body to produce insulin for glucose uptake by cells and degradation in the smaller units of connexons, called connexins, possibly leading to the onset of heart disease. Cardiovascular disease and diabetes, type I and II, affects similar locations within cells of the heart and pancreas. This location is the gap junction, where connexons facilitate rapid cell-to-cell interactions via electrical transmissions. Gap junctions are often present at nerve endings such as in cardiac muscle and are important in maintaining homeostasis in the liver and proper function of the kidneys. The gap junction itself is a structure that is a specialized transmembrane protein formed by a connexon hemichannel. Cardiovascular disease and possibly type I and II diabetes, are each associated with a major protein connexin that makes up the gap junction.

In cardiovascular disease, Cx43 (connexin 43), a subunit of a connexon, is a general protein of the gap junction stimulating cardio myocyte muscle cells of intercalated discs facilitating synchronized beating of the heart. In the occurrence of cardiovascular disease the Cx43 subunit begins to show signs of oxidative stress, the ability of the heart to counteract the buildup of harmful toxins due to age or diet leading to reduced vascular functions. Additionally, reduced Cx43 expression in vascular tissue, which plays a part in ventricular remolding and healing of wounds after a myocardial infarction, are present in structural heart disease. However, the mechanisms of Cx43 in the heart are still poorly understood. Overall, these changes in Cx43 expression and oxidant stress can lead to abnormalities in the coordinated beating of the heart, predisposing it to cardiac arrhythmias.

Connexons are also associated with both Type I and Type II diabetes. Cx36 (connexin 36) subunit mediates insulin excretion and glucose-induced insulin release from gap junctions of the liver and pancreas. Homeostasis in the liver and pancreatic organs are supported by an intricate system of cellular interactions called endocrine signaling. The secretion of hormones into the blood stream to target distant organs. However, endocrine signaling in the pancreas and liver operates along short distances in the cellular membrane by way of signaling pathways, ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, tyrosine-kinase receptors, and cell-to-cell contact. The gap junctions in these tissues supported by endocrine signaling arbitrate intracellular signals between cells and larger organ systems by connecting adjacent cells to each other in a tight fit. The Tight fit of the gap junction is such that cells in the tissue can communicate more efficiently and maintain homeostasis. Thus the purpose of the gap junction is to regulate the passage of ions, nutrients, metabolites, second messengers, and small biological molecules. In diabetes the subsequent loss or degradation of Cx36 substantially inhibits insulin production in the pancreas and glucose in the liver which is vital for the production of energy for the entire body. A deficiency of Cx36 adversely affects the ability of the gap junction to operate within these tissues leading a reduction in function and possible disease. Similar symptoms associated with the loss or degradation of the gap junction have been observed in type II diabetes, however, the function of Cx36 in Type 1 and type II diabetes in humans is still unknown. Additionally, the Cx36 connexin is coded for by GJD2 gene, which has a predisposition on the gene locus for type II diabetes, and diabetic syndrome.

<text>, also known as and , is a Japanese castle located in Shimabara, Hizen Province (present day Nagasaki prefecture). This five-story white building stands in stark contrast to the black Kumamoto Castle in neighboring Kumamoto Prefecture.

==Description==
Shimabara Castle is a , located between Ariake Bay and Mount Unzen. The outer moats, some 15 meters deep and between 30–50 meters wide, extended 360 meters east-west and 1260 meters north-south, with the enclosed area divided into three baileys. The walls extended for 3900 meters and had 16 &quot;yagura&quot; of various sizes at key points. The main &quot;donjon&quot; had five stories, and a height of 33 meters, and was connected to two secondary keeps, each with three stories. In terms of scale, it was far larger than normal for a &quot;daimyō&quot; with revenues of only 40,000 &quot;koku&quot; .

==History==

The Arima clan, who were &quot;Kirishitan daimyō&quot;, ruled over Shimabara Domain in the late Muromachi period from Hinoe Castle and Hara Castle. After the start of the national isolation policy, the Tokugawa Bakufu banned Christianity from 1614 and replaced Arima Naozumi with Matsukura Shigemasa. Matsukura, who strictly enforced the prohibition against Christianity with mass executions, also severely raised taxes to pay for the construction of his new Shimabara Castle from 1618-1624. This oppression of the peasants was a major factor leading to the Shimabara Rebellion.

The castle came under siege during the Shimabara Rebellion, but was not damaged. It subsequently served as the seat of the Kōriki clan, who ruled Shimabara from 1638–1668, Matsudaira clan (1669–1747, 1774–1871) and Toda clan (1747–1774)

The Matsudaira &quot;daimyō&quot; remained in residence at Shimabara Castle until the Meiji Restoration of 1868. It was the seat of the local government until 1871, when the former Shimabara Domain was merged into the new Nagasaki prefecture. The keep was pulled down in 1876, as were most of the supporting structures. The third bailey became a school grounds, and most of the inner bailey was given over to farmland.

Today, only the moat and stone walls remain from the original structure. A number of the &quot;yagura&quot; were restored in 1960 and 1972, and the keep was rebuilt in 1964 in reinforced concrete as a city museum containing exhibits of the &quot;Kirishitan&quot; culture, Shimabara Rebellion and feudal period.

In 1980, a memorial museum was opened in honor of Seibo Kitamura, a noted sculptor. In 2006, the Shimabara Castle was listed one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation.

<text>&quot;No taxation without representation&quot; (often shortened to &quot;taxation without representation&quot;) is a political slogan that originated in the American Revolution, and which expressed one of the primary grievances of the American colonists for Great Britain. In short, many colonists believed that as they were not represented in the distant British parliament, any taxes it imposed on the colonists (such as the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts) were unconstitutional and were a denial of the colonists&#x27; rights as Englishmen since the Magna Carta.

The firm belief that the government should not tax a populace unless that populace is represented in some manner in the government developed in the English Civil War, following the refusal of parliamentarian John Hampden to pay ship money tax. In the context of British taxation of its American colonies, the slogan &quot;No taxation without representation&quot; appeared for the first time in a headline of a February 1768 &quot;London Magazine&quot; printing of Lord Camden&#x27;s &quot;Speech on the Declaratory Bill of the Sovereignty of Great Britain over the Colonies,&quot; which was given in parliament. The British government argued for virtual representation, the idea that people were represented by members of Parliament even if they didn&#x27;t get to vote for them.

The term has since been used by various other groups advocating for representation or protesting against taxes, such as the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, advocates of District of Columbia voting rights, students seeking to be included in governance in higher education, the Tea Party movement, and others.

== Prior to the American Revolution ==

According to Michael Hudson, the idea had an early precedent in medieval English law, which established the principle in the &quot;Magna Carta&quot; where chapter 12 states that “(n)o scutage or aid is to be levied in our kingdom, save by the common counsel of our kingdom.”

The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660. By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right. The English Bill of Rights 1689 had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament. Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. Parliament initially contended that the colonists had virtual representation, but the idea &quot;found little support on either side of the Atlantic&quot;. The person who first suggested the idea of Parliamentary representation for the colonies appears to have been John Oldmixon, an English annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I. It was afterwards put forward with approbation by Adam Smith, and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Benjamin Franklin.&quot;

The 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance, which was written by the Virginia House of Burgesses was likewise sent to Parliament, only to be ignored.

== American Revolution ==


The phrase had been used for more than a generation in Ireland. By 1765, the term was in use in Boston, and local politician James Otis was most famously associated with the phrase, &quot;taxation without representation is tyranny.&quot; In the course of the Revolutionary era (1750–1783), many arguments were pursued that sought to resolve the dispute surrounding Parliamentary sovereignty, taxation, self-governance and representation.

=== Representative proposals before 1776 ===
In the course of the 1760s and 1770s, William Pitt the Elder, Sir William Pulteney, and George Grenville, amongst other prominent Britons and colonial Americans, such as Joseph Galloway, James Otis Jr., Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, the London Quaker Thomas Crowley , Royal Governors such as Thomas Pownall  M.P., William Franklin, Sir Francis Bernard, and the Attorney-General of Quebec, Francis Maseres, debated and circulated plans for the creation of colonial seats in London, imperial union with Great Britain, or a federally representative British Parliament with powers of taxation that was to consist of American, West Indian, Irish and British Members of Parliament. Despite the fact that these ideas were considered and discussed seriously on both sides of the Atlantic, it appears that neither the American Congress, nor the colonial Assemblies, nor the British Government in Westminster, at least prior to the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, officially proposed such constitutional developments. Governor Thomas Hutchinson apparently referred to a colonial representational proposal when he wrote that, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay was the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764 ... And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons ... an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet ... it was renounced ... by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable.

Jared Ingersoll Sr., colonial agent for Connecticut, wrote to his American colleague, the Royal Governor of Connecticut Thomas Fitch, that following Isaac Barre&#x27;s famous Parliamentary speech against the Stamp Act in 1764, Richard Jackson, M.P., supported Barre and other pro-American M.P.s by producing before the House copies of earlier Acts of Parliament that had admitted Durham and Chester seats upon their petitions for representation. The argument was put forward in Parliament that America should have representatives on these grounds too. Richard Jackson supposed that Parliament had a right to tax America, but he much doubted the expediency of the Stamp Act. He said if it was necessary, as ministers claimed, to tax the colonies, the latter should be permitted to elect some part of the Parliament, &quot;otherwise the liberties of America, I do not say will be lost, but will be in danger.&quot;

==== The Knox-Burke debates ====
William Knox, an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament. He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, &quot;The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed&quot;, Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation. Knox submitted that: Whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed ... The truth ... is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament ... and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament&#x27;s] legislative acts ... are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes ... The colony advocates ... tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they ... mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.

Edmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up &quot;The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed&quot; as well as &quot;The Present State of the Nation&quot; under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract &quot;Observations on a Late State of the Nation&quot;: NOW comes [Knox&#x27;s] American representation ... Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville&#x27;s]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.

While Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.

==== &quot;On the American Taxation&quot; ====
Burke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain. Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled &quot;On American Taxation&quot;, Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking: What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote? You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful ... My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.

However, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that: The Parliament of Great Britain ... is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary] ... superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in war,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, &#x27;Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you.&#x27; This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.

==== William Pitt the Elder ====
The views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy &quot;internal&quot; taxes &quot;for the purposes of raising a revenue&quot; without the consent of actual representatives of the &quot;Commons of America&quot;. &quot;It is my opinion,&quot; Pitt said, &quot;that this kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies.&quot;

==== Colonial spokespersons ====
In 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that:

Otis, Jr., attended the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates. The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had &quot;a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists&quot; and that &quot;the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature.&quot; Furthermore, it was declared that, &quot;it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists.&quot;

Daniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in an influential 1765 pamphlet that, &quot;the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament ... [is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons.&quot; Dulany, Jr., denied that Parliament had a right &quot;to impose an internal Tax upon the Colonies, without their consent for the single Purpose of Revenue.&quot;

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, &quot;an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.&quot;

==== Republicanism ====
To those sympathetic to republicanism, such as James Burgh, Catherine Macauley, and Richard Price, any tax revenue measures that were voted into effect without the direct representation of Americans were &quot;unconstitutional&quot; and &quot;pernicious&quot;. Burgh felt that virtual representation was &quot;subversive of liberty&quot; and &quot;unjust in its principles&quot; and that the House of Commons must include colonial representatives when it voted on colonial matters, or operate by using the consent of the colonial Assemblies.

==== Heightening of tensions ====
American colonists rejected the Stamp Act 1765 brought in by British Prime Minister George Grenville, and initiated boycotts of British goods which helped bring about the repeal of the act in 1766. The passage of the Townshend Acts in 1767 and 1768 again led to colonial protests, including a renewed boycott movement against British wares. Most of the taxes in the Townshend Acts were repealed in 1770 by the Ministry of Lord North. The passage of the Tea Act 1773 in May 1773, which enforced the remaining taxes on tea, led to the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the Crown-in-Parliament. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming militias and seized political control of each colony, ousting the royal governors – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.

The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though ), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in London, i.e. without representation for the colonists in British Parliament.

Patrick Henry&#x27;s resolution in the Virginia legislature implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the British Constitution, and that Virginia alone had the right to tax Virginians.

==== Efforts at conciliation ====
This offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication &quot;A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans&quot;. In February 1775, Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.

=== Representative proposals after 1776 ===
James Macpherson, a colonial secretary of British West Florida, defended the North administration in an officially sponsored polemic in 1776 named &quot;The Rights of Great Britain Asserted&quot;. This work replied to the Continental Congress&#x27; July 6, 1775 &quot;Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms&quot; by proposing that, Had the Americans, instead of flying to arms, submitted the same supposed grievance [as the taxed though unrepresented Palatine counties in England had], in a peaceable and dutiful manner, to the Legislature, I can perceive no reason why their request should be refused. Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that &quot;for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;&quot; this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament ... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects ... The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation , can meet no compromise.&quot; The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; when he recommended the Americans &quot;to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament&quot; on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.

Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in &quot;Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress&quot; of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Rights of the British Colonies&quot; and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable.&quot; Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that &quot;local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament&quot;. The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778. In that year &quot;the commissioners of the king of Great Britain,&quot; known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of &quot;a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain&quot;.

== Virtual representation ==
In Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry. This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life. Therefore the British government tried to argue that the colonists had virtual representation in their interests. In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, utilized the doctrine of &#x27;virtual representation&#x27; in an attempt to extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimize the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act.

In English history, &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the &quot;representation&quot; was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a &quot;virtual representation.&quot; &quot;We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection,&quot; declared Samuel Johnson in his political pamphlet &quot;Taxation No Tyranny&quot;. He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. &quot;They are represented,&quot; he said, &quot;by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England.&quot; However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was &quot;sophistry&quot; and &quot;a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [&quot;sic&quot;] the weak.&quot; The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have &quot;usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history.&quot;

=== Colonial reactions ===
Virtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also. The colonial position was that the &quot;virtual&quot; was a cover for political corruption and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. In 1765, the American lawyer and politician James Otis, Jr., responded to Soame Jenyns&#x27; &quot;The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies, by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered&quot;. Otis&#x27; own publication was entitled &quot;Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists, in a Letter to a Noble Lord&quot;. He wrote in it, &quot;To what purpose is it to ring everlasting changes to the colonists on the cases of Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, who return no members? If those now so considerable places are not represented, they ought to be.&quot; Writing in his 1763 publication &quot;The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved&quot;, Otis declared that,
Every British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights ... which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away ... [are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them ... [that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly &#x27;till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others ... Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both ... [Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.

Otis simultaneously refuted, in &quot;The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved&quot;, a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the colonial agents&#x27; alleged influence on British policy. &quot;As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents,&quot; he wrote,
I know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.

Colonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even &quot;If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold,&quot; said Daniel Dulany, &quot;not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain.&quot; The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.

The argument between the colonies and Parliament sought to resolve how the British &#x27;commoners&#x27; of the various part of the Empire were represented most constitutionally – as Daniel Dulany, an American Loyalist and lawyer, put it &quot;[the] constitutional authority [of Parliament&#x27;s rights to bind American subjects] depends upon the single question, Whether the Commons of Great-Britain are virtually the representatives of the Commons of America, or not.

=== Pitt and Camden ===
The theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, and his ally William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the &#x27;&quot;Commons of America&quot; without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, &quot;even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated.&quot; He then said, I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both ... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent.&quot;

In his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, Chief Justice James Mansfield, Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington, and others. He responded:[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. ... My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man&#x27;s own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. ... [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. ... I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, &#x27;What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?&#x27;&quot;In an appearance before Parliament in January 1766, former Prime Minister William Pitt stated:
The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.

Grenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America &quot;border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution.&quot; External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.

== Modern use in the United States ==

In the 1860s, suffragette Sarah E. Wall of Worcester, Massachusetts invoked the principle of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;, initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were granted the right to vote. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863. In &quot;Wheeler v. Wall,&quot; the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall&#x27;s inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes. In 1884, Susan B. Anthony cited Wall&#x27;s audacity and willingness to stand up for women&#x27;s suffrage, stating, &quot;for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes.&quot;

The phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes (sales, income, property) but lack the ability to vote, such as felons (who are, in many states, barred from voting), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don&#x27;t live in), or people under 18.

To become citizens of the United States, immigrants most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually five years). Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot vote. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship. Throughout U.S. history, non-citizens have been allowed to vote in 40 U.S. states and territories. As of 2005, non-citizens are allowed to vote in seven jurisdictions in the United States: Chicago and six towns in Montgomery County, Maryland. As of 2021, both Montpelier and Winooski, Vermont allow non-citizens to vote in municipal elections. 

In 2009, the phrase &quot;taxation without representation&quot; was also used in the Tea Party protests, where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.

A modified version of the phrase, &quot;no tuition without representation&quot;, is sometimes used in disputes over governance in higher education in the United States to emphasize student&#x27;s rights to a voice in institutional decisions. The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at Union County College in New Jersey. It has been used more recently in disputes at Dartmouth College, UC Berkeley School of Law, and elsewhere.

=== District of Columbia ===
In the United States, the phrase is used in the District of Columbia as part of the campaign for a vote in Congress, to publicize the fact that District of Columbia residents pay federal taxes, but do not have representation in Congress. In November 2000, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles began issuing license plates bearing the slogan &quot;Taxation without representation&quot;. In a show of support for the city, President Bill Clinton used the &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; plates on the presidential limousine; however, President George W. Bush had the tags replaced to those without the motto shortly after taking office. President Barack Obama announced his intention to use the plates with the motto beginning at his second inauguration. President Donald Trump continued usage of the plates with the protest motto after he was elected, though he has stated he has &quot;no position&quot; on the issue of granting D.C. statehood. In 2017, the phrase was modified to &quot;End Taxation Without Representation&quot;.

In 2002, the Council of the District of Columbia authorized adding the slogan to the D.C. flag, but no new flag design was approved. In 2007, the District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters program was created based on the successful 50 State Quarters program. DC submitted designs containing the slogan, but they were rejected by the U.S. Mint.

== In other countries ==

=== Use in Australia ===
The first government of South Australia was by a legislative council, whose members were chosen by the Crown and from which office-bearers &quot;Official Members&quot; were selected by the Governor. John Stephens and his &quot;South Australian Register&quot; were among those who campaigned for democratic reform. Partial reform took place in 1851, when a majority of Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1851–1855 were elected.

=== Modern use in Canada ===
In Canada, Quebec politician Gilles Duceppe, former leader of the Bloc Québécois, has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in Ottawa. The Bloc is a Québec sovereigntist party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec. Duceppe&#x27;s evocation of the phrase implies that the proponents of Quebec&#x27;s sovereigntist movement have the right to be represented in the body (which they are), the Canadian Parliament, which levies taxes upon them. He will usually cite the sentence in its original English.

=== Modern use in the United Kingdom ===
British Prime Minister John Major used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the United Nations&#x27;s 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, &quot;It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation,&quot; in order to criticize the billion-dollar arrears of the United States&#x27; payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.

<text>Joseph Martin McCabe (12 November 1867 – 10 January 1955) was an English writer and speaker on freethought, after having been a Roman Catholic priest earlier in his life. He was &quot;one of the great mouthpieces of freethought in England&quot;. Becoming a critic of the Catholic Church, McCabe joined groups such as the Rationalist Association and the National Secular Society. He criticised Christianity from a rationalist perspective, but also was involved in the South Place Ethical Society which grew out of dissenting Protestantism and was a precursor of modern secular humanism.

==Early life==
McCabe was born in Macclesfield in Cheshire to a family of Irish Catholic background, but his family moved to Manchester while he was still a child. He entered the Franciscan order at the age of 15, and spent a year of preliminary study at Gorton Monastery. His novitiate year took place in Killarney, after which he was transferred to Forest Gate in Essex (to the school which is now St Bonaventure&#x27;s Catholic School) for the remainder of his priestly education. In 1890 he was ordained into the priesthood with the name &quot;Father Antony&quot;.

He was recognised as an outstanding scholar of philosophy, and was sent for a year (1893–1894) to study at the Catholic University of Louvain. Here he was successfully taught Hebrew by Albin van Hoonacker, and, less successfully, Syriac by T. J. Lamy. He also studied under, and befriended, Mercier. He returned to London and resumed priestly and educational duties, until in October 1895 when he was put in charge of the newly founded Franciscan college in Buckingham, (which is now St Bernardine&#x27;s Catholic Church, Buckingham). He had gradually been losing his faith and eventually left that post and the priesthood in February 1896.

==Writing career==
Shortly after leaving the priesthood, McCabe began writing. He wrote a pamphlet on his experiences, &quot;From Rome to Rationalism&quot;, published in 1897, which he then expanded to book length as &quot;Twelve Years in a Monastery&quot; (1897). William Ferguson wrote of him: &quot;He was bitterly anti-Catholic but also actively undermined religious faith in general.&quot; From 1898 to 1899 he was secretary of the Leicester Secular Society, and he was a founding board member in 1899 of the Rationalist Press Association of Great Britain. He wrote prolifically on science, religion, politics, history and culture, writing nearly 250 books during his life. Many of his books and pamphlets were published by E. Haldeman-Julius, both as Little Blue Books and Big Blue Books. Over 100 Big Blue Books by McCabe were published.

McCabe was also respected as a speaker, and gave several thousand lectures in his lifetime.

McCabe was also an advocate of women&#x27;s rights and worked with Mrs. Pankhurst and Mrs. Wolstenholme-Elmy on speeches favoring giving British women the right to vote.

McCabe is also known for his inclusion in G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s book &quot;Heretics&quot;. In a previous essay he took Chesterton to task for including humor in his serious writings. By doing so, he allowed Chesterton to make the quip &quot;Mr. McCabe thinks that I am not serious but only funny, because Mr. McCabe thinks that funny is the opposite of serious. Funny is the opposite of not funny, and of nothing else.&quot;

McCabe was also active in organizations, although his biographer notes that he had a difficult relationship with some of their leading figures, and consequently relations between McCabe and various groups could also be strained. He was an Appointed Lecturer at the South Place Ethical Society, where he could still occasionally be heard after 1934. McCabe&#x27;s freethought stance grew more militant as he got older, and he joined the National Secular Society in the year before he died.

===Evolution===

In 1900 McCabe translated the book &quot;Riddle of the Universe&quot; by Ernst Haeckel. He also wrote a number of works on evolution.
McCabe was also involved with the Rationalist Association and in 1925 they arranged for him to debate the early Canadian young earth
creationist George McCready Price.

===Religion===

In his essays &quot;The Myth of the Resurrection&quot; (1925) and &quot;Did Jesus Ever Live?&quot; (1926) McCabe wrote that Christianity is a direct representation of older Pagan beliefs. Slain saviors and their resurrection myths were currently known and celebrated across the ancient world before Christianity began. According to McCabe the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection of Jesus contain numerous conflicts, contradictions and errors and are unreliable as they had been fabricated over the years by many different writers. McCabe came to the conclusion that Jesus was an Essenian holy man who was turned into a God over the years by hearsay and oral tradition. The real bulk of McCabe&#x27;s work was in historical criticism of the Roman Catholic religious system in which he was raised and educated.

In about 1947, McCabe accused the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; of bias towards the Catholic Church. He claimed that the 14th edition, which had been published in 1929, was devoid of the critical comment about the church that had been in the 11th edition. McCabe similarly accused the &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; of bias towards the Catholic Church in 1951. These and similar actions have made him be termed a &quot;Catholic basher&quot; by his Christian critics. Biographer Bill Cooke, however, disputes the allegation, citing McCabe&#x27;s opinion that &quot;Catholics are no worse, and no better, than others&quot;, and &quot;I have not the least prejudice against the Catholic laity, which would be stupid.&quot;

===Spiritualism===

In 1920 McCabe publicly debated the Spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle on the claims of Spiritualism at Queen&#x27;s Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against Spiritualism in a booklet entitled &quot;Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?&quot;. McCabe had exposed the tricks of fraud mediums and wrote that Spiritualism has no scientific basis. His article &quot;Scientific Men and Spiritualism&quot; is a skeptical analysis of the subject and a look at how various scientists such as William Crookes and Cesare Lombroso had been duped into believing Spiritualism by mediumship tricks. He also wrote the book &quot;Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847&quot;.

<doc id="773567" wikidata="Q1517146" url="?curid=773567" title="History of Szczecin">
<text>The History of [[Szczecin]] () dates back to the 8th century. Throughout its history the city has been part of Poland, Denmark, Sweden and Germany. Since the Middle Ages, it is one of the largest and oldest cities in the historic region of Pomerania, and today, is it the largest city in northwestern Poland.

==Prehistory==
Tacitus located the East Germanic tribe of the Rugians in the area around Szczecin, as did modern historians. The Rugians left during the Great Migrations in the 5th century AD.

==Slavonic stronghold, medieval Poland (8th–12th century)==

Another stronghold was built in the 8th century-first half of the 9th century at the ford of the Oder River, (at the same location where later was a ducal castle) and a few craftsmen, fishermen and traders settled in the vicinity. Later it became the main centre of a Western Slavic tribe of Ukrani (Wkrzanie) living in the fork of the Oder between the main branch and the Randow River. Several Triglav temples existed nearby. Szczecin became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I of Poland in 967, part of which it remained for several decades.

After the decline of Wolin in the 12th century, &quot;Stetinum&quot; became one of the most important and powerful cities of the Baltic Sea south coasts, having some 5,000 inhabitants. In a winter campaign of 1121–1122, the area was subjugated by Boleslaw III of Poland, who invited the Catholic bishop Otto of Bamberg to baptize the citizens (1124). Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania is recorded as the local duke during this time. Wartislaw managed to expand his duchy westward, thereby forming the territorial body of the later Duchy of Pomerania, and organized the second visit of Otto in 1128. At this time the first Christian church of St. Peter and Paul was erected. It remained under Polish suzerainty until the fragmentation of Poland following the death of Boleslaw III of Poland and afterwards remained the capital of the separate Duchy of Pomerania, still ruled by the local Slavic Griffin dynasty, of which Wartislaw I was the first historical ancestor, for the centuries to come, until its extincion in 1637. Szczecin did not lose its capital status even during the partitions of Pomerania and always was seat of Pomeranian dukes.

From the late 12th century the city briefly fell under the overlordship of Saxony from 1164, Denmark from 1173, Holy Roman Empire from 1181 and again Denmark from 1185, however, local dukes still maintained very close ties with the fragmented Polish realm, and Władysław III Spindleshanks (future Polish monarch) stayed at the court of Bogusław I, Duke of Pomerania in Szczecin in 1186, on behalf of his father, Duke of Greater Poland Mieszko III the Old, who also periodically was the High Duke of Poland. The ducal mint in Szczecin was founded around 1185.

==Capital of the Duchy of Pomerania (12th century–1630)==

Szczecin was held by Denmark until 1235, when it fell under the suzerainty of the multi-ethnic Holy Roman Empire. In the second half of the 12th century, a group of German tradesmen (from various parts of the Holy Roman Empire) settled in the city around St. Jacob&#x27;s Church, which was founded by Beringer, a trader from Bamberg, and consecrated in 1187. For centuries the dukes invited German settlers to colonize their land and to found towns and villages (&quot;see Ostsiedlung&quot;). Duke Barnim of Pomerania granted a local government charter to a local community in 1237, separating the Germans from the Slavic majority community settled around the St. Nicholas Church (in the neighborhoods of Chyzin, Uber-Wiken, and Unter-Wiken). Barnim granted the city Magdeburg rights in 1243. In 1277 the city purchased the nearby villages, present-day districts, Krzekowo and Osów. In 1278 Szczecin, along with several other cities, was exempted by King Eric V of Denmark from customs duties for a fair organized in Zealand, Denmark. This is the first case of the city&#x27;s connections with the Hanseatic League. Around that time the major ethnic group of the city had become German, while the Slavic population decreased.

In 1273 in Szczecin duke of Poznań and future King of Poland Przemysł II married princess Ludgarda, granddaughter of Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, in order to strengthen the alliance between the two rulers.
From 1295 to 1464 the city was the capital of a splinter eponymous duchy in Pomerania. (Its Dukes were Otto I, Barnim III the Great, Casimir III, Swantibor I, Boguslaw VII, Otto II, Casimir V, Joachim I the Younger, Otto III.) In 1478 it became part (and capital) of the reunited Duchy of Pomerania under duke Bogislaw X, and in 1532 it again became the capital of a splinter eponymous duchy.

In the 13th and 14th centuries the town became the main Pomeranian centre of trade in grains, salt and herrings, receiving various trading privileges from their dukes (known as emporium rights). It was granted special rights and trading posts in Denmark, and belonged to the Hanseatic trading cities union. In 1390 trade privileges were granted to Stettin by the Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło who established new trade routes from Poland to the Pomeranian ports. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Stettin conducted several trade wars with the neighboring cities of Gartz, Greifenberg (Gryfino) and Stargard over a monopoly on grains export. The grain supplying area was not only Pomerania but also Brandenburg and Greater Poland – trade routes along the Oder and Warta rivers. The 16th century saw the decline of the city&#x27;s trading position because of the competition of the nobility, as well as church institutions in the grains exports, a customs war with Frankfurt (Oder), and the fall of the herring market. 
In the 16th century, it remained an important port for Polish exports of grain, wood, ash, tar and hemp, floated from western Poland down the Warta and Oder rivers. Social and religious riots marked the introduction of the Protestant Reformation in 1534.

Around 1532 minting of coins in the city was halted, to be resumed in 1580 under duke John Frederick. Then were minted the first thalers of the Duchy of Pomerania.

In 1570, the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War between Denmark and Sweden was ended in the city by the Treaty of Stettin (1570).

From 1606 to 1618 the city was the residence of Duke Philip II, the greatest patron of the arts among all Pomeranian dukes. He founded a rich collection of ancient and early modern coins at the Ducal Castle. In 1625 the city became again capital of the reunited Duchy of Pomerania under Boguslaw XIV.

By the 1630s the city and surrounding area that hadn&#x27;t been already German had become completely Germanized.

==Under Swedish rule (1630–1720)==
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Stettin refused to accept German imperial armies, instead the Pomeranian dukes allied with Sweden. After the Treaty of Stettin (1630) manifested Swedish occupation, Stettin was fortified by the Swedish Empire. After the death of the last Pomeranian duke, Boguslaw XIV, Stettin was awarded to Sweden with the western part of the duchy in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), but remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Swedish-Brandenburgian border was settled in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). The King of Sweden became Duke of Pomerania and as such held a seat in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. The city was cut off from its main trading area, and was besieged in several wars with Brandenburg which shattered the city&#x27;s economy, which fell in prolonged economic decline. 

In 1654 the last Pomeranian duke Boguslaw XIV was buried in the Ducal Castle.

==Major Prussian and German port (1720–1918)==

In 1713, Stettin was occupied by the Kingdom of Prussia; the Prussian Army entered the city as neutrals to watch the ceasefire and refused to leave. In 1720 the city was officially awarded by Sweden to Prussia. In the following years Stettin became the capital of the Prussian Province of Pomerania, and the main port of the Prussian state. From 1740 onwards, the Oder waterway to the Baltic Sea and the new Pomeranian port of Swinemünde (Świnoujście) were constructed.

In 1721, a French commune was founded in the city for the Huguenots. The French were subject to separate French law and had a separate French court, which existed until 1809. In the following years, large groups of Huguenots settled in the city, bringing new developments into the city crafts and factories. The French greatly contributed to the city&#x27;s economic revival, and were treated with reluctance by the German burghers and city authorities. The population increased from 6000 in 1720 to 21,000 in 1816, and 58,000 in 1861.

During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1806 the city surrendered to France without resistance, and in 1809 also Polish troops were stationed in the city. In 1813 the city was besieged by combined Prussian-Russian-Swedish forces, and the French retreated in December 1813. Afterwards it fell back to Prussia.
The 19th century was an age of large territorial expansion for the city, especially after 1873, when the old fortress was abolished. In 1821, the crafts corporations were abolished, and in steam transport on the Oder began, allowing further development of trade. The port was developing quickly, specialising in exports of agricultural products and coal from the Province of Silesia. Economic development and rapid population growth brought many ethnic Poles from Pomerania and Greater Poland looking for new career opportunities in the Stettin industry. More than 95% of the population consisted of Germans. In 1843, Stettin was connected by the first railway line to the Prussian capital Berlin, and in 1848 by the second railway to Posen (Poznań). New branches of industry were developed, including shipbuilding (at the AG Vulcan Stettin and Oderwerke shipyards) and ironworks using Swedish ores. Before World War I, there were 3,000 Polish inhabitants in the city, including some wealthy industrialists and merchants. Among them was Kazimierz Pruszak, director of the Goleniów (then &quot;Gollnow&quot;) industrial works, who predicted eventual &quot;return of Szczecin to Poland&quot;. The population grew to 236,000 in 1910 and 382,000 in 1939.

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the Prussians established a prisoner-of-war camp for around 1,700 French troops in the city, of which 600 died. There is a memorial at the site of the former cemetery of the French POWs.

==Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany (1918-1945)==

In 1918, the city became part of the new Free State of Prussia, part of the Weimar Republic.

After World War I, the economy of Stettin declined again because the seaport was separated from its agricultural supply areas in Posen with the creation of the Second Polish Republic.

In the deeply flawed March 1933 German federal election the Nazi Party received 79,729 votes in the city, i.e. nearly half of the votes cast. The socialists, communists and conservative nationalists have also received noticeable support, receiving 22%, 13% and 11.4% of the votes respectively.

During World War II, the Germans operated over 100 forced labour camps in the city, including multiple &quot;Polenlager&quot; camps solely for Poles, a Nazi prison with forced labour subcamps in the region, and a Dulag transit camp for prisoners of war. The city was a major centre of weapons industry (including the car production Stoewer). The Polish resistance movement was active in the city and conducted espionage of the Kriegsmarine, infiltrated the local German industry, distributed underground Polish press, and facilitated escapes of Polish and British prisoners of war who fled from German POW camps via the city&#x27;s port to neutral Sweden (see also: &quot;Poland–Sweden relations&quot;). 65% of the city&#x27;s buildings and almost all of the city centre, seaport, and industry were destroyed during the Allied air raids in 1944, and heavy fighting between the German and Soviet armies (26 April 1945).
===Polish diaspora===
In the interwar period Polish presence fell to 2,000 people. Between 1925 and 1939 a Polish Consulate existed, which initiated the foundation of a Polish school, where Polish was taught, and a scouts team.
The Polish minority remained active despite repressions, a number of Poles were members of the Union of Poles in Germany.

Repressions against Poles intensified especially after Adolf Hitler came to power led to closing of the school. Members of Polish community who took part in cultural and political activities were persecuted and even murdered (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). In 1938 the head of Stettin&#x27;s Union of Poles unit Stanisław Borkowski was imprisoned in the Oranienburg concentration camp. In 1939 all Polish organisations in Stettin were disbanded by German authorities. During the war, some teachers from the Golisz and Omieczyński schools were executed.

According to German historian Jan Musekamp, the activities of the Polish pre-war organizations were exaggerated after World War II for propaganda purposes.

==Polish People&#x27;s Republic==
After World War II, the Polish-German border was preliminarily moved by the Allies to the west of the Oder-Neisse line, which would have made Stettin remain German. On 28 April 1945 Piotr Zaremba, nominated by Polish authorities as mayor of Szczecin came to the city. In early May the Soviet authorities appointed the German Communists Erich Spiegel and Erich Wiesner as mayors. and forced Zaremba to leave the city twice According to Zaremba initially about 6,500 Germans remained in the city. Polish authors estimate the number of Poles in the city at this time at 200. The German population returned, as the war was over. It was undecided if the city would be in Poland or in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, but eventually Szczecin was handed over to Polish authorities on 5 July 1945 -as agreed by the Soviet-imposed Treaty of Schwerin of 21 September 1945.

The number of inhabitants:
* 1939: 382,000.
* 1945: 260,000 (German population partially expelled, war losses).

Polish authorities were led by Piotr Zaremba. Many Germans had to work in the Soviet military bases that were outside Polish jurisdiction. In the 1950s most of the pre-war inhabitants were expelled from the city in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, although there was a significant German minority for the next 10 years.

In 1945 there was already a small Polish community consisting of the few pre-war inhabitants and the Polish forced workers during World War II, who survived the war. The city was settled with the new inhabitants from every region of Poland, mainly from Pomerania (Bydgoszcz Voivodeship) and Greater Poland (Poznań Voivodeship), but also including those who lost their homes in the eastern Polish territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union, especially the city of Wilno. This settlement process was coordinated by the city of Poznań. Also Poles repatriated from Harbin, China (see also: &quot;Poles in China&quot;) and Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War (see also: &quot;Greeks in Poland&quot;), settled in Szczecin in the following years.

==Voivodeship capital in Poland (after 1945)==

Old inhabitants and new settlers did a great effort to raise the Szczecin from ruins, rebuild, reconstruct and extend the city&#x27;s industry, residential areas but also the cultural heritage (e.g. the Pomeranian Dukes&#x27; Castle in Szczecin), and it was still harder to do this under the communist regime. Szczecin became a major industrial centre of and a principal seaport not only for Poland (especially the Silesian coal) but also for Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

The people of Szczecin supported and raised medical supplies and donated blood for the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In December 1956, Szczecin was the site of a mass protest against the Soviets and communist rule and in solidarity with the Hungarian Revolution. Protesters seized and demolished the Soviet consulate. Protesters were later persecuted and imprisoned by the communists. In 2016, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Polish solidarity with the Hungarians, the Hungarian-funded &quot;Boy of Pest&quot; monument was unveiled in Szczecin. Szczecin together with Gdańsk, Gdynia and Upper Silesia was the main centre of the democratic anti-communist movements in first in March 1968 and December 1970. The protesters attacked and burned the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party regional headquarters and the Soviet consulate in Szczecin. The riots were pacified by the secret police and the armed forces; see: Coastal cities events. After 10 years in August 1980 the protesters locked themselves in their factories to avoid the bloody riots. The strike was led by Marian Jurczyk, leader of the Szczecin Shipyard workers and it proved successful. On 30 August 1980, the first agreement between the protesters and the communist regime was signed in Szczecin, which paved the way for the creation of the Solidarity movement, which contributed to the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. Further protests and strikes took place in 1982 and 1988.

From 1946 to 1998 Szczecin was the capital of the Szczecin Voivodeship, but the region&#x27;s boundaries were redrawn in the administrative reorganizations in 1950 and 1975. Boundaries of the Szczecin City were extended by joining with Dąbie in 1948. Since 1999 it is the capital of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Communist-dominated municipal administration was replaced by a local government in 1990, and the direct election of the city president (mayor) was introduced in 2006.

==Demographics==
Since the medieval Christianization of the region, the population of Szczecin was largely Catholic. After the Reformation it was predominantly composed of Protestants, and since the end of World War II the majority of the population is once again composed of Catholics.

<doc id="773571" wikidata="Q3893091" url="?curid=773571" title="Pancho and Lefty">
<text>&quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, originally &quot;Poncho and Lefty&quot;, is a song written by American country singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt. Perhaps his most well-known song, Van Zandt recorded his original version of this song for his 1972 album &quot;The Late Great Townes Van Zandt&quot;. The song has been recorded by several artists since its composition and performance by Van Zandt, with a 1983 version by Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. In 2021, Van Zandt&#x27;s version was ranked number 498 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Music and lyrics==

The song is composed as a ballad of four stanzas which use the two-verse refrain: &quot;All the Federales say they could&#x27;ve had him any day/ They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose.&quot; The first two stanzas are sung back-to-back with the refrain being sung only after the second stanza. The verses of the first stanza introduce Lefty as a restless young soul who leaves home and his loving mother to seek his fortune south of the border. The verses of the second stanza introduce Pancho as a Mexican bandit, who &quot;wore his gun outside his pants for all the honest world to feel&quot;. The third stanza tells of Pancho&#x27;s eventual death in &quot;the deserts down in Mexico&quot; and implies that he was betrayed to the &quot;federales&quot; by Lefty in exchange for being allowed to return to the United States. Lefty spends the rest of his life in a motel in Cleveland, apparently regretful of his actions. The fourth stanza poetizes Pancho&#x27;s life and appears to evoke sympathy for Lefty&#x27;s attempted homecoming.

While Van Zandt did not intend for Pancho to be Pancho Villa, he did not rule out the idea. In an interview, he recalled, &quot;I realize that I wrote it, but it&#x27;s hard to take credit for the writing, because it came from out of the blue. It came through me and it&#x27;s a real nice song, and I think, I&#x27;ve finally found out what it&#x27;s about. I&#x27;ve always wondered what it&#x27;s about. I kinda always knew it wasn&#x27;t about Pancho Villa, and &quot;then&quot; somebody told me that Pancho Villa had a buddy whose name in Spanish meant &#x27;Lefty.&#x27; But in the song, my song, Pancho gets hung...and the real Pancho Villa was assassinated.&quot;

==Background and reception==
Like much of Van Zandt&#x27;s output, the song went largely unnoticed at the time of its release on the album &quot;The Late Great Townes Van Zandt&quot; in 1972. Neither it nor its parent album made any music charts. In 1973, Lonnie Knight played with Van Zandt for a week at the Rubaiyat in Dallas, Texas. He brought this song back to Minneapolis with him and recorded it on his first album, &quot;Family In The Wind&quot;, in 1974.

In 1977, Emmylou Harris covered the song on her album &quot;Luxury Liner&quot;. Harris says she feels it is &quot;her song&quot;, and it was this recording of the song that Willie Nelson first heard.

Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard recorded a version for their July 1983 duet album &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty&quot;. In the documentary &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot;, Nelson states that when he asked Van Zandt what the song was about Van Zandt replied that he didn&#x27;t know. Nelson also recalls how his album with Haggard was nearly completed but he felt they didn&#x27;t have &quot;that blockbuster, you know, that one big song for a good single and a video, and my daughter Lana suggested that we listen to &#x27;Pancho and Lefty.&#x27; I had never heard it and Merle had never heard it.&quot; Lana Nelson returned with a copy of the song and Nelson cut it immediately with his band in the middle of the night but had to retrieve a sleeping Haggard, who had retired to his bus hours earlier, to record his vocal part.

The vocals were recorded in one take that night. The next day, Haggard wanted to rerecord his part, but Nelson told him the song had already been sent to New York. Haggard later stated that the song was the only one he had ever recorded before &quot;he really knew it&quot;.

Van Zandt appears in the video for the song, playing one of the &quot;federales&quot;. &quot;It was real nice they invited me,&quot; Van Zandt told Aretha Sills in 1994. &quot;They didn&#x27;t have to invite me and I made I think $100 a day. I was the captain of the federales. And plus I got to ride a horse. I always like that. It took four and a half days and that video was four and a half minutes long...The money goes by a strange life, or elsewhere.&quot;

When released as a single, this version of the song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. The royalties would provide Van Zandt with some badly needed income, though by all accounts he remained impervious to the song&#x27;s success. One story involving the song that Van Zandt loved to tell was when he got pulled over for speeding in Berkshire, Texas, by two policemen, the first a blue-eyed white man with a crew cut, and his partner a bronze, dark eyed Mexican. Although his driver&#x27;s license was up-to-date, the inspection sticker had expired, and the bedraggled singer found himself in the back of the police cruiser. As Van Zandt recounted on &quot;Austin Pickers&quot;, &quot;We got stopped by these two policemen and...they said &#x27;What do you do for a living?&#x27;, and I said, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;m a songwriter,&#x27; and they both kind of looked around like &quot;pitiful, pitiful,&quot; and so on to that I added, &#x27;I wrote that song Pancho and Lefty. You ever heard that song Pancho and Lefty? I wrote that&#x27;, and they looked back around and they looked at each other and started grinning...&quot; The policemen explained that their police-radio code names were Pancho and Lefty and they let Van Zandt off with a warning.

The song is probably Van Zandt&#x27;s most recognizable and is often covered. Steve Earle told John Kruth in 2004, &quot;You won&#x27;t find a song that&#x27;s better written, that says more or impresses songwriters more.&quot; In the film &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot;, Kris Kristofferson recites the opening lines of the song and then marvels, &quot;And I could think, &#x27;That was me!&#x27;&quot;

Bob Dylan, whose album &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&quot;&#x27; had a major impact on Van Zandt, performed the song as a duet on television with Willie Nelson at Nelson&#x27;s 60th birthday concert in 1993, which Andy Greene of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remembers as &quot;the highlight of the night&quot;.

==Video release==

A music video was released for the song in 1983, depicting Willie Nelson as Pancho, and Merle Haggard as Lefty. Townes Van Zandt also appears in a supporting role. Nelson&#x27;s daughter Lana directed the video, the first for Nelson and second for Haggard, the first being for &quot;Are the Good Times Really Over?&quot; a year prior.

== Reception ==

The song reached No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Songs chart dated July 23, 1983. The Willie Nelson release has sold 648,000 digital copies in the United States as of October 2019 since becoming available for download.
===Legacy===
&quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot; was covered by Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson; it was the title track of their duet album &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty&quot;, and a number one country hit that entered the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2020.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as the 17th-greatest Western song of all time.

In June 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot; 41st on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time&quot;.

In 2021, the original version was listed at #498 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

<text>Charybdotoxin (ChTX) is a 37 amino acid neurotoxin from the venom of the scorpion &quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus&quot; (&quot;deathstalker&quot;) that blocks calcium-activated potassium channels. This blockade causes hyperexcitability of the nervous system. It is a close homologue of agitoxin and both toxins come from &quot;Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus&quot;. It is named after Charybdis, a sea monster from Greek myth.

==Chemical properties==

===Family===
The Charybdotoxin family of scorpion toxins is a group of small peptides that has many family members, such as the pandinotoxin, derived from the venom of scorpion Pandinus imperator.

===Structure===
Scorpions such as the deathstalker paralyze their prey by injecting a potent mix of peptide toxins. Charybdotoxin, a 37 amino acid, 4 kDa neurotoxin with the molecular formula C176H277N57O55S7, is one of the peptide toxins that can be extracted from the venom of the scorpion. Its structure is very similar to that of margatoxin. Charybdotoxin contains three disulfide bridges.

==Mode of action==
Charybdotoxin occludes the pore of calcium-activated voltage-gated shaker K+ channels by binding to one of four independent, overlapping binding sites. It binds both to the open and the closed states. In addition, the block is enhanced as the ionic strength is lowered. This block occurs as the Asn 30 on the CTX interacts with the Asp 381 on the K+ channel. The blockade of K+ channels by the charybdotoxin peptide causes neuronal hyperexcitability. Mutations of the Lys31Gln and the Asn30Gln had the effect of lessening the CTX block of the pore on the shaker channel.

==Treatment==
Anti-scorpion venom serum (AScVS) is an effective and safe method of therapy in severe scorpion envenoming syndrome. Compared with other therapies like alpha blockers it has a relatively short recovery period (10 vs 16–42 hours).

<doc id="773607" wikidata="Q7366187" url="?curid=773607" title="Rook (card game)">
<text>Rook is a trick-taking game, usually played with a specialized deck of cards. Sometimes referred to as Christian cards or missionary cards, Rook playing cards were introduced by Parker Brothers in 1906 to provide an alternative to standard playing cards for those in the Puritan tradition, and those in Mennonite culture who considered the face cards in a regular deck inappropriate because of their association with gambling and cartomancy.

== Rook playing cards ==

George S. Parker and his wife Grace sought to create a deck of cards that could be marketed to people with religious objections to the standard deck.

To accomplish this, George and Grace recast the standard deck of playing cards. They replaced the Ace with a &quot;1&quot; and the jack, queen, and king with &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, and &quot;13&quot; cards, and added a &quot;14&quot; card as well. The hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds were replaced with &quot;suits&quot; of colors: red, yellow, green, and black. With this new fifty-six-card deck, whist and most other common card games could be faithfully played.

Grace chose the name &quot;Rook&quot;, and with the addition of a &quot;Rook&quot; card (serving as the Joker) the 57-card deck took its final shape.

== Official rules ==

The official rules for Tournament Rook (also known as Kentucky Discard) are as follows.

Four players are organized into two teams of two players each, sitting opposite each other. Players must keep their hands secret from all other players, including their teammates. The object of the game is to be the first team to reach 300 points by capturing cards with a point value in tricks. If both teams have over 300 points at the end of a round, the team with the higher point total wins.

Only certain cards have a point value. These are known as counters. Each 5 is worth 5 points, each 10 and 14 is worth 10 points, and the Rook Bird card is worth 20 points.

=== The deal ===
The 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are removed from the deck, and the Rook Bird card is added, for a total of 41 cards. The dealer shuffles and cuts the deck, then deals all of the cards, one at a time. After every player has received his or her first card, the dealer places one card face-down in the center of the table. This is repeated until there are five cards (the nest) in the middle of the table. The remaining cards are dealt normally.

=== Bidding ===
After the deal, players bid in increments of 5 points for the privilege of naming the trump suit. Bidding starts with the player to the left of the dealer and passes clockwise. The minimum bid is 70 points, and the maximum is 120 points (the number of points a team would make if they captured all the counters in the game). Players choosing not to increase the bid may pass to the next player. A player that has passed may not make another bid for the round. The high bidder adds the five cards of the nest to his or her hand, then lays any five cards to the side. The high bidder then names the trump suit. At any time during the bidding process, a player can call a redeal if they have no points in their hand.

=== Play ===
After the trump suit has been named, the player to the left of the dealer places any card of any suit face-up on the center of the table. Play proceeds clockwise, with each player playing one card face-up in turn. After each player has played, the player that played the highest card of the suit of the leading card takes all of the cards played, or &quot;takes the trick&quot;.

A player must either follow suit (play a card of the leading suit) or play the Rook Bird card. Players with no cards of the leading suit may play any other card, including the Rook Bird card or a card of the trump suit. The highest card of the leading suit takes the trick, unless a trump card is played, in which case the highest trump card takes the trick.

The error of a player reneging, or failing to follow suit, may be corrected before the next trick is taken. If it is not discovered until later, the round ends, and the team that made the error loses a number of points equal to the bid, regardless of which team made the bid. The opponents score all the counters they captured before the error was discovered.

The person who takes the trick leads in the next trick. When a trick is taken, it is placed face-down in front of the player who took it. Tricks taken may not be reviewed by any player until the end of the round. The player that takes the last trick in a round captures the nest and scores any counters in it.

=== The Rook Bird card ===
The Rook Bird card may be played at any time, even if the player who holds it is able to follow suit, and is the only card that may be played this way.

If the Rook Bird card is led, all other players must play a trump card, if they have one. The Rook Bird must be played when the trump suit is led and the player holding the Rook Bird card cannot follow suit.

=== Scoring ===
When all possible tricks have been taken, each team adds the counters they captured. If the bidding team failed to make the number of points bid, the team loses a number of points equal to the amount of the bid, and does not make any points for counters captured in the round.

<text>The Canadian Medical Association Journal (French Journal de l&#x27;Association Médicale Canadienne) is a peer-reviewed open-access general medical journal published by the Canadian Medical Association. It publishes original clinical research, analyses and reviews, news, practice updates, and editorials.

== Notable articles ==
The journal has published the following notable articles:
# Banting and Best&#x27;s 1922 report, &quot;Pancreatic extracts in the treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;. Banting and Macleod were awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin in 1923.
# 1926 – the first use of liver as a treatment for anemia, which led to the isolation of vitamin B12.
# 1938 – CMAJ warns about the relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer.
# 2003 – CMAJ responds rapidly to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), publishing timely information during the outbreak.
# 2009 – CMAJ publishes a research paper on the increased risk of reinfarction associated with proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel, which has been widely cited and generated related research studies on the topic.

== CMAJ Open ==
&quot;CMAJ Open&quot;, an online open-access offshoot established in January 2013 with Diane Kelsall as its editor-in-chief, has an open peer-review system which makes reviewer comments, author responses, and previous versions available online along with the final versions of contributions.

==History==
A prime mover behind establishment of the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; was Andrew Macphail, chair of the history of medicine at McGill University and editor of the &quot;Montreal Medical Journal&quot;. At the Canadian Medical Association&#x27;s 1907 annual meeting held in Montreal, &quot;Macphail argued that without a journal to express its views and record its proceedings the association would have little impact&quot;, and was successful in getting a clause urging the founding of a journal put into the CMA constitution. At the 1910 meeting an executive report was adopted urging immediate steps to found a journal. Macphail was appointed the first editor.

The &quot;Montreal Medical Journal&quot; was acquired, and the &quot;Maritime Medical News&quot; agreed to suspend publication. The first issue of the new &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; was published in January 1911. In 1913, for the first time, the journal showed a profit, which was sufficient to liquidate the previous deficit. Subscriptions had increased 60% over the 1911 level and were being purchased by 20% of Canadian doctors.

On February 20, 2006, the editor-in-chief, John Hoey, was fired over an editorial independence dispute with the then owners of the journal, CMA Media. The journal sent 13 women to buy the emergency contraceptive levonorgestrel (Plan B) over-the-counter in pharmacies across Canada and reported their experiences. The pharmacists asked them for personal data, including the women&#x27;s names, addresses, dates of last menstrual period, when they had unprotected sex, customary method of birth control, and reason for dispensing the medication. This was at the recommendation of the Canadian Pharmacists Association, which also advised members to store the information permanently in their computers. The Canadian Women&#x27;s Health Network said that collecting this information was unnecessary and a violation of privacy. The Canadian Pharmacists Association complained to the Canadian Medical Association, demanding that the names of the pharmacists be removed from the article. The Canadian Medical Association ordered the journal to comply. The Canadian Medical Association then fired Hoey, without giving a reason.

On February 28, 2006, the acting-editor, Stephen Choi and editorial fellow Sally Murray, resigned from the journal over the same reason, leaving it without any full-time editorial staff, which raised questions about the future of the publication. In January 2007, Paul Hebert became editor-in-chief. After completion of Hebert&#x27;s term, John Fletcher became editor-in-chief in January 2012.

In April 2007, the former staff launched a new open-access journal, &quot;Open Medicine&quot;.

On February 29, 2016, a similar controversy re-surfaced as the Canadian Medical Association disbanded the CMAJ&#x27;s Journal Oversight Committee and dismissed editor-in-chief John Fletcher. The CMA cited a falling impact factor and a decline in research submissions as reasons for the change, but these claims are disputed. Diane Kelsall, a long-time CMAJ deputy editor, became interim editor-in-chief while the organization searched for a permanent replacement.

In December 2021, CMAJ published a letter that said the hijab was &quot;an instrument of oppression&quot;. After the letter was criticized as Islamophobic, CMAJ apologized and retracted the letter.

James Maskalyk became the executive editor-in-chief in 2022.

<doc id="773612" wikidata="Q1191029" url="?curid=773612" title="Hirado Castle">
<text>was the seat of the Matsura clan, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hirado Domain, of Hizen Province, Kyūshū. It is located in present-day Hirado city Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. It was also known as .

==Description==
Hirado Castle was built on top of a small, rounded mountainous peninsula facing Hirado Bay, surrounded on three sides by water.

==History==
After Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s successful conquest of Kyūshū, local warlord Matsura Shigenobu was granted Hirado County and the Iki Island to be his domain. In 1599, Matsura Shigenobu erected a castle called Hinotake-jō on the site of the present-day Hirado Castle. However, he burned the castle down himself in 1613, as a gesture of loyalty towards Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu, having served in the losing Toyotomi side during the Battle of Sekigahara. In return, he was allowed to retain his position as &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hirado Domain under the Tokugawa bakufu.

The present Hirado Castle was constructed in 1704 by order of the 4th &quot;daimyō&quot; of Hirado domain, Matsura Takashi with the assistance of the Tokugawa shogunate. It was intended to be the keystone in coastal defense in the East China Sea region, as the government had by then implemented a policy of national seclusion against Western traders and missionaries. The design was partly influenced by the theories of the military strategist Yamaga Sokō. The new construction was completed in 1718, and the castle remained home to the Matsura &quot;daimyō&quot; until the Meiji bils of 1868.

In 1871, with the abolition of the han system, all structures of Hirado Castle were dismantled, with the exception of the northern gate, a &quot;yagura&quot; and the moat, and the grounds turned into Kameoka Park, with a Shinto shrine dedicated to the spirits of the successive generations of the Matsura &quot;hankang&quot;. The former residence of the final &quot;daimyō&quot;, Matsura Akira was turned into a local history museum.

In 1962, four &quot;yagura&quot;, the ramparts, and the keep were reconstructed. The modern keep is a five-story steel-reinforced concrete structure and contains a museum with artifacts of the Matsura clan. One of these artifacts is a 93-cm long Japanese sword (&quot;tachi&quot;) dating from the Asuka period, and is locally purported to have been carried by a general during the time of the legendary Empress Jingū&#x27;s invasion of Korea. An heirloom of the Matsura clan, it is now owned by Kameoka Shrine and is designated as a National Important Cultural Property (ICP).

In 2006, Hirado Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation.

<text>Samuel Royal Thurston (April 15, 1816 – April 9, 1851) was an American pioneer, lawyer and politician. He was the first delegate from the Oregon Territory to the United States Congress and was instrumental in the passage of the Donation Land Claim Act.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Thurston was born in Monmouth, Maine, and grew up in Peru, Maine; his father died when he was young. After attending Dartmouth College, he graduated in 1843 from Bowdoin College in Maine, graduating with honors. He then studied law under Robert Dunlap. Thurston met Elizabeth McLench in college and married her after graduating. The couple moved to Burlington, Iowa in 1845.

Thurston came to the Oregon Country in 1847 as an emigrant over the Oregon Trail. In Oregon he settled in Hillsboro, where he practiced law. Then in 1848 he was elected to the Provisional Legislature from Tuality District where he served with fellow Hillsboro resident David Hill. In 1849, Thurston was selected to represent the Oregon Territory in the U.S. Congress.

===Political career===

In the struggle for the control of Oregon lands, Thurston was an ally of Jason Lee against John McLoughlin, the chief of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver who Thurston, for shamefully political reasons, accused of helping thwart settlement in the territory. As Congressional delegate, Thurston authored the Donation Land Claim Act so as to give McLoughlin&#x27;s HBC claim to the state legislature. Thurston and Lee made false statements about McLoughlin before the United States Supreme Court in an effort to publicly discredit him. The statements resulted in the denial of McLoughlin&#x27;s land claims to his homestead in Oregon City.

Thurston&#x27;s major political achievement was in helping pass the Donation Land Claim Act in 1850. The act legitimized existing land claims in the Oregon Territory and granted 640 acres (2.6 km²) to each married couple who would settle and cultivate the land for four years. The act is considered a forerunner of the 1862 Homestead Act.

In 1850 he wrote an address to Congress urging the prohibition of free African-Americans from the Oregon Territory, in which he said:

[It] is a question of life or death to us in Oregon. The negroes associate with the Indians and intermarry, and, if their free ingress is encouraged or allowed, there would a relationship spring up between them and the different tribes, and a mixed race would ensure inimical to the whites; and the Indians being led on by the negro who is better acquainted with the customs, language, and manners of the whites, than the Indian, these savages would become much more formidable than they otherwise would, and long bloody wars would be the fruits of the comingling of the races. It is the principle of self preservation that justifies the actions of the Oregon legislature.In order to prevent employees of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company from claiming land in the Oregon Territory, Thurston advocated for the Donation Land Claim Act to only allow land claims by American citizens. Thurston singled out indigenous Hawaiian HBC employees in particular, calling them &quot;a race of men as black as your negroes of the South, and a race, too, that we do not desire to settle in Oregon.&quot; Thurston added that white men who left the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and became American citizens should be eligible for land claims, but that Hawaiian men should not be eligible.

===Death and legacy===
While returning to Oregon via Panama, Thurston died of the effects of a tropical fever off Acapulco, Mexico while aboard the steamer &quot;California.&quot; According to a contemporary obituary:

He died on the 9th [of April 1851] ... eight days from Panama ... His arduous labors at Washington had prepared his system for an attack of the malignant fever incident to the Isthmus, from the effects of which he had not recovered before experiencing a severe attack of diarrhea, which, together with an affection of the liver, under which he had sometime labored, terminated his earthly existence.

Thurston&#x27;s body was originally interred in Acapulco, but his remains were brought to Oregon two years later by an act of the Oregon Legislature. His body was reburied in the Salem Pioneer Cemetery in Salem. The inscription reads: &quot;Here rests Oregon&#x27;s first delegate, a man of genius and learning. A lawyer and statesman. His devotions equaled his wide philanthropy, his public acts are his best eulogium.&quot;

Thurston County, Washington, originally part of the Oregon Territory and now containing the state capital of Washington (Olympia), was named in his honor.

<doc id="773618" wikidata="Q1502279" url="?curid=773618" title="Evil demon">
<text>The evil demon, also known as Deus deceptor, malicious demon, and evil genius, is an epistemological concept that features prominently in Cartesian philosophy. In the first of his 1641 &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, Descartes imagines that a malevolent God or an evil demon, of &quot;utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me.&quot; This malevolent God or evil demon is imagined to present a complete illusion of an external world, so that Descartes can say, &quot;I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to ensnare my judgement. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things.&quot;

Some Cartesian scholars opine that the malevolent God or evil demon is also omnipotent, and thus capable of altering mathematics and the fundamentals of logic, though omnipotence of the malevolent God or evil demon would be contrary to Descartes&#x27; hypothesis, as he rebuked accusations of the evil demon having omnipotence. It is one of several methods of systematic doubt that Descartes employs in the &quot;Meditations.&quot;

==In context==
Prior to the &quot;Meditations&quot; proper, Descartes gives a synopsis of each Meditation and says of Meditation One that &quot;reasons are provided which give us possible grounds for doubt about all things, especially material things&quot; and that whilst the usefulness of such extensive doubt may not be immediately apparent, &quot;its greatest benefit lies in 
*freeing us from all our preconceived opinions, and 
*providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses. 
The eventual result of this doubt is to 
*make it impossible for us to have any further doubts about what we subsequently discover to be true.&quot;

Descartes offers some standard reasons for doubting the reliability of the senses culminating in the dream argument and then extends this with the deceiving God argument. Descartes refers to &quot;the long-standing opinion that there is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am&quot; and suggests that this God may have &quot;brought it about that there is no earth, no sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the same time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as they do now&quot;. Furthermore, this God may have &quot;brought it about that I too go wrong every time I add two and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is imaginable&quot;.

After the deceiving God argument Descartes concludes that he is &quot;compelled to admit that there is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not properly be raised&quot;. 

It is only after arriving at this conclusion that Descartes introduces the evil demon.

Although Descartes has provided arguments for doubting all his former beliefs he notes that &quot;my habitual opinions keep coming back&quot;. It is to deal with this problem that Descartes decides he must do more than just acknowledge that the beliefs are open to doubt and must deceive himself, &quot;by pretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly false and imaginary&quot; and that he shall do this &quot;until the weight of preconceived opinion is counter-balanced and the distorting influence of habit no longer prevents my judgement from perceiving things correctly&quot;.

It is to achieve this state of denial that Descartes says he will suppose that &quot;some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me&quot;.

The evil demon is also mentioned at the beginning of Meditation Two. Descartes says that if there is &quot;a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me&quot; then he himself must undoubtedly exist for the deceiver can &quot;never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something&quot;. A little later he says, &quot;But what shall I now say that I am, when I am supposing that there is some supremely powerful and, if it is permissible to say so, malicious deceiver, who is deliberately trying to trick me in every way he can?&quot;

==The deceiving god==
Some writers, e.g. Williams and Musgrave, make no distinction between the deceiving God and evil demon arguments and regard anything said about the deceiving God as being equivalent to saying something about the evil demon.

Other writers acknowledge that Descartes makes mention of both but then claim they are &#x27;epistemologically equivalent&#x27;. Kenny says, &quot;the two hypotheses do not differ in any respect of epistemological importance... The content of the two hypotheses is the same...&quot; Newman says, &quot;Descartes&#x27; official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is merely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more general hyperbolic doubt... Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the evil genius... as a kind of mnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature.&quot;

If they are epistemologically equivalent, then the question arises as to why Descartes temporarily shifted from the deceiving God to the evil demon. It is tempting to think it is because there is a relevant theological difference. In Meditation Three, Descartes is going to establish not only that there is a God but that God is not a deceiver. When Descartes first introduces the evil demon he says, &quot;I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon, had employed his whole energies in deceiving me.&quot; Kenny says, &quot;The hypothesis of the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent.&quot; However, at least in Meditation One, Descartes doesn&#x27;t have a problem in postulating a deceiving God and he rejects the objection that such deception is inconsistent with God&#x27;s supreme goodness. He says, &quot;if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion cannot be made.&quot; This is consistent with what he writes in the &quot;Principles&quot; where he says, &quot;we have been told that God who created us can do all that he desires, and we do not yet know whether he may not have willed to create us in such a way that we shall always be deceived even in the things that we think ourselves to know best.&quot;

Other writers insist that it is important to maintain the distinction between the deceiving God and the evil demon. Gouhier (quoted by Kenny) argues that the deceiving God is an intellectual scruple that will disappear when metaphysics demonstrates its falsity whilst the evil demon is a methodological procedure designed to make a certain experiment and it ceases with that experiment. He says, &quot;Neither the purpose nor the content of the two hypotheses allow us to regard the one as a variant of the other.&quot;

Vendler argues that literary form of the Meditations is heavily influenced by St. Ignatius of Loyola&#x27;s Spiritual Exercises to which Descartes will have been exposed during his training at the Jesuit college of La Fleche. As such, &quot;The demon in the First Meditation is not evoked to serve as an epistomological menace, but as a psychological device: following Loyola&#x27;s advice &quot;age contra!&quot; (go against!), it provides a counterweight to our inordinate inclination to trust the senses.&quot; He adds, &quot;the &#x27;demon-argument&#x27; is not an argument at all. Descartes does not need another argument at this stage: the dream argument has already shown the unreliability of the senses and the deceiver-God argument the uncertainty of mathematics. For one thing, the demon does not even touch mathematics or geometry. Why should he? He is evoked by Descartes to cure his inordinate attachment to the senses; he does not complain (and would not) of a similar attachment to mathematics or geometry.&quot; Hatfield takes a similar line saying, &quot;Descartes adopts a common practice from the spiritual exercises upon which his metaphysical meditations are modelled, devising a program for training the will to keep the old beliefs at bay&quot; adding, &quot;It seems likely that he chose to call his hypothetical deceiver a &quot;malicious demon&quot; in order to avoid having the meditator concentrate extensively on the thought that God could be a deceiver, a proposition he considered false and one he intended to refute later.&quot;

==Omnipotence==

Among the accusations of blasphemy made against Descartes by Protestants was that he was positing an omnipotent malevolent God. Voetius accused Descartes of blasphemy in 1643. Jacques Triglandius and Jacobus Revius, theologians at Leiden University, made similar accusations in 1647, accusing Descartes of &quot;hold[ing] God to be a deceiver&quot;, a position that they stated to be &quot;contrary to the glory of God&quot;. Descartes was threatened with having his views condemned by a synod, but this was prevented by the intercession of the Prince of Orange (at the request of the French Ambassador Servien).

The accusations referenced a passage in the &quot;First Meditation&quot; where Descartes stated that he supposed not an optimal God but rather an evil demon &quot; &amp; &quot; (translated as &quot;most highly powerful and cunning&quot;). The accusers identified Descartes&#x27; concept of a &quot;deus deceptor&quot; with his concept of an evil demon, stating that only an omnipotent God is &quot;summe potens&quot; and that describing the evil demon as such thus demonstrated the identity. Descartes&#x27; response to the accusations was that in that passage he had been expressly distinguishing between &quot;the supremely good God, the source of truth, on the one hand, and the malicious demon on the other&quot;. He did not directly rebut the charge of implying that the evil demon was omnipotent, but asserted that simply describing something with &quot;some attribute that in reality belongs only to God&quot; does not mean that that something is being held to actually &quot;be&quot; a supreme God.

According to Janowski, &quot;The alleged distinction between the respective powers of God and the evil genius that escaped the attention of the two theologians also escaped the attention of a host of distinguished Cartesian scholars (Alquié, Beck, Brehier, Chevalier, Frankfurt, Gilson, Kenny, Laporte, Kemp-Smith, Wilson), who, only seldom interested in interpreting Descartes&#x27; philosophy through the prism of doctrinal orthodoxy, also insist on the omnipotence of the evil genius.&quot; He further claims that the reason for this is that there is progression through the &quot;First Meditation&quot;, leading to the introduction of the concept of the evil genius &quot;which crowns the process begun at the outset of the Meditations.&quot;

However, it is not quite so straightforward. For example, Wilson notes that &quot;Gouhier has shown, the hypothesis of the malign spirit takes over from that of the Deceiving God from the end of the First Meditation to the beginning of the Third—where the latter figure is resubstituted without comment or explanation. As Gouhier has also noted, the summary of &#x27;doubts&#x27; in the concluding passage ... does not include mention of mathematical propositions—which are not again brought into discussion until the Third Meditation.&quot; She adds in the accompanying footnote that, even if one has to concede that the text doesn&#x27;t reveal any sharp distinction between the power hypothetically ascribed to the &#x27;malignant spirit&#x27; and that genuinely attributable to God, &quot;Gouhier&#x27;s observation is essentially accurate, and useful in understanding the rhetoric and organization of the first three Meditations. It may also have some deeper significance, because of the association ... of the possibility of deception in mathematics with the doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths.&quot;

Similarly, Kenny who does say that the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God &quot;simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent&quot;, for &quot;The content of the two hypotheses is the same, namely that an omnipotent deceiver is trying to deceive&quot;, goes on to note that, &quot;If the two hypotheses differ at all, it is the first that is more skeptical than the second. God ... may have made him go wrong in mathematics ... the evil genius merely reinforces the doubt that the external world may be a dream.&quot; When Kenny says that the evil genius is simply a substitute for the deceitful God, he is not trying to establish that, therefore, the evil genius was omnipotent, instead he is challenging the view that the evil genius somehow progressed on from God and is rejecting the view that &quot;the evil genius is to serve a more radically skeptical purpose than the hypothesis of the deceitful God.&quot;

According to Janowski, the fact that the demon is not said to challenge mathematics, implies either that the evil demon is not omnipotent or that Descartes retracted Universal Doubt. Janowski notes that in the &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (I, 15) Descartes states that Universal Doubt applies even to &quot;the demonstration of mathematics&quot;, and so concludes that either Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditation&quot; is flawed, lacking a reason for doubting mathematics, or that the charges of blasphemy were well placed, and Descartes &quot;was&quot; supposing an omnipotent evil demon.

However, this is only a problem if one assumes that Descartes was withdrawing the notion of a deceitful God and replacing it with the evil demon. More recent commentators take the argument to have reached its conclusion with the deceitful God. When Descartes says, &quot;I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon...&quot; he is not rejecting the notion of a deceitful God on the grounds that God is not a deceiver for this is something he is not entitled to rely on, because, as he says at the beginning of Meditation three, he doesn&#x27;t &quot;yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all&quot;. Instead, he is introducing an aid to the meditator who finds that, despite the arguments presented, &quot;habitual opinions keep coming back&quot;. Kenny says, &quot;The purpose of taking seriously the hypothesis of the evil genius is to counterbalance natural credulity and keep in mind the doubts raised by the supposition of the deceitful God.&quot; When the role of the demon is understood this way the issue of the demon&#x27;s omnipotence becomes unimportant.

==The brain in a vat==

In 1968, James Cornman and Keith Lehrer suggested something they called the braino machine that &quot;operates by influencing the brain of a subject who wears a special cap, called a &quot;braino cap.&quot; When the braino cap is placed on a subject&#x27;s head, the operator of the braino can affect his brain so as to produce any hallucination in the subject that the operator wishes. The braino is a hallucination-producing machine. The hallucinations produced by it may be as complete, systematic, and coherent as the operator of the braino desires to make them.&quot; The braino argument was intended to show that, even if it is sometimes possible for a person to tell if they are hallucinating, it is not possible for them to know that they are not hallucinating. If the braino is operated by an evil being, whom Cornman and Lehrer call Dr. O, then it would be possible for Dr. O to create in a person experiences that are identical to the ones of the supposed real world. If that were the case, then the experiences thus created would not constitute knowledge, for the source of those experiences would be the machine and not the world. However, since the fake and the real would be hypothetically indistinguishable, it follows that the current supposed experiences of the real world are also insufficient to generate knowledge. This proof by contradiction that the real world cannot generate knowledge, and thus that the fake imitation world cannot generate knowledge either, is one proposed way of disproving the Brain in a Vat argument. 

In 1973, in the introduction to his book &quot;Thought&quot;, Gilbert Harman said, &quot;it might be suggested that you have not the slightest reason to believe that you are in the surroundings you suppose you are in ... various hypotheses could explain how things look and feel. You might be sound asleep and dreaming or a playful brain surgeon might be giving you these experiences by stimulating your cortex in a special way. You might really be stretched out on a table in his laboratory with wires running into your head from a large computer. Perhaps you have always been on that table. Perhaps you are quite a different person from what you seem...&quot;

Such scenarios had been used many times in science fiction but in philosophy it is now routine to refer to being like a &#x27;brain in a vat&#x27; after Hilary Putnam produced an argument which, ironically, purported to show that &quot;the supposition that we are actually brains in a vat, although it violates no physical law, and is perfectly consistent with everything we have experienced, cannot possibly be true. &quot;It cannot possibly be true&quot;, because it is, in a certain way, self-refuting.&quot;

Putnam&#x27;s argument notwithstanding, the brain in a vat scenario is usually presented as a sceptical argument and in many ways equivalent to Descartes&#x27; deceiving God and evil demon.

One crucial difference that prevents such scenarios being a direct substitute for the deceiving God and evil demon is that they generally presuppose that we have heads or bodies whereas it is important for Descartes to argue that he can doubt the existence of his body and that he can only be sure he is a &#x27;thinking thing&#x27;. Harman&#x27;s version of the story does, however, add the final thought that having a brain &quot;might be just part of the myth you are being given&quot;.

<text>BellSouth Mobility, LLC headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, was a BellSouth subsidiary.

BellSouth Mobility operated wireless networks using many different wireless communication standards. The most widely used of these technologies is called Digital AMPS, or D-AMPS. Data services were provided by BellSouth Wireless Data, and used the pre-2.5G Mobitex standard.

==History==

BellSouth Mobility was a mobile phone network operated by the American landline telephone company BellSouth. It was founded in 1984 during the breakup of AT&amp;T, which included dividing Advanced Mobile Phone Service, Inc. among the Baby Bells. It ran AMPS and D-AMPS across most of the territory covered by the BellSouth landline company. In 2000, it became part of the Cingular Wireless network, and the BellSouth branding was dropped; however, the company continued to exist as an operating subsidiary.
In 2004, following Cingular&#x27;s acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless Services, BellSouth Mobility ceased to exist when it was legally merged into New Cingular Wireless PCS, LLC, the renamed former operating subsidiary of AT&amp;T Wireless Services.

==Facts==
* BellSouth Mobility used D-AMPS as opposed to Sprint and Verizon&#x27;s IS-95 technology. Despite this, BellSouth Mobility offered Sprint and Verizon customers roaming onto their older AMPS network.

<text>The Polish Peasant Bloc (, PBL) was a short-lived political party in Poland, founded in 2003 by members of the parliamentary circle of the same name, which was established in December 2002. It was dissolved in 2004, however the parliamentary circle existed until January 2005. It claimed to follow patriotic-peasant-democratic values. The chairman of the grouping was Wojciech Mojzesowicz. In 2014 PBL was reactivated as an informal grouping, and Wacław Klukowski became its president.

==History==

The party as well as the parliamentary circle associated with it was formed by Wojciech Mojzesowicz and his associated. Mojzesowicz was an agrarian politician who first started his career in 1989, when he won a seat in the Sejm in the 1989 Polish parliamentary election as member of the agrarian socialist United People&#x27;s Party. He then joined the agrarian Polish People&#x27;s Party and became a leader of the party&#x27;s regional branch in Bydgoszcz, but soon left the party to join Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland in 1999, a party and a trade union founded by Andrzej Lepper, who was Mojzesowicz&#x27;s classmate in vocational school.

Samoobrona emerged in 1992 as a radical rural trade union movement that led militant nationwide strikes and protests. It then quickly became known for its radical tactics, with clashes with the police becoming common for Samoobrona-led protests. Samoobrona soon got involved in politics, becoming a national left−wing agrarian party, gaining popularity through its attacks on Leszek Balcerowicz, the economic minister who introduced capitalism and market economy to Poland through his neoliberal Balcerowicz Plan. Promoting slogans such as &quot;Balcerowicz must go!&quot;, Samoobrona acted as an outspoken defender of the poor and disadvantaged, accusing the Polish government of impoverishing many for the benefit of the few through dissolution of socialism and implementation of capitalism.

Upon establishing itself as a political party, Samoobrona became a party with an agrarian populist and a Catholic socialist identity. It was described as far-left, and was based on radical conception of the economic class, aiming to represent the poor and disadvantaged classes at large. Initially, Samoobrona was an agrarian trade union that rocked the 1990s political scene of Poland with its radical protest methods and anti-capitalist demands. In what it called the &quot;star march&quot;, Samoobrona would block main roads of the cities with agricultural vehicles; the situation eventually escalated into open clashes with riot police, as the farmers represented by Samoobrona attempted to storm government buildings. Starting in 1992, the party founded &quot;Peasant Battalions&quot; (), referring to a Polish agrarian WW2-era resistance movement of the same name, which was a paramilitary subdisivion of Samoobrona organized to protect farmers against evictions and bailiffs. The &quot;Peasant Batallions&quot; of Samoobrona harassed public officials, reportedly shaving their heads or robbing them. In regards to the batallions and the goal of the party itself, Lepper stated: &quot;We will strengthen physical fortitude, develop patriotism and train our military troops. We don&#x27;t want war, but we have a lawless state, so we will fight the state offices - bailiffs, banks, tax offices - with weapons in hand. We are a radical party, open to all disadvantaged people who are starving at home.&quot;

Samoobrona gained tremendous popularity after a nationwide blockade of agricultural import the European Union was cancelled by the Rural Solidarity, the main agrarian union of Poland, which refused to work with Samoobrona on the basis of their &quot;communist&quot; ideology and &quot;terrorist&quot; behaviour. Polish farmers frustrated with the inability of their trade unions to cooperate flocked to Samoobrona, and the party itself moved to conventional politics, gradually extending its appeal beyond farmers to a broad socioeconomic message. Samoobrona became associated less with farmers and was described instead as increasingly a &quot;party of working people, of the impoverished, exploited, and wronged&quot;. Between 1992 and 1993, it ws Samoobrona that organized half of all rural protets in Poland, and is considered an important radicalization factor amongst the Polish countryside, especially given the willingness of Samoobrona to assault police offers and debt collectors. By 1999, while most agrarian trade unions reversed their stance towards Samoobrona and now backed it despite its &quot;neo-communist&quot; ideology, the party was now strong enough to act on its own, and became more popular in the countryside than the Polish People&#x27;s Party, the traditional agrarian party.

Samoobrona participated in the 2000 Polish presidential election, nominating Andrzej Lepper as its candidate. During the presidential campaign, Lepper confirmed the direction of the party by arguing that socialism should br restored in Poland as it had &quot;not yet reached full maturity&quot;. In 2000, the percentage of Poles declaring their dissatisfaction with the political situation rose to 50%, up from 30% in 1999. Samoobrona tried to utilize this by positioning itself as an anti-establishment party, and continuing its rhetoric as the &quot;defender of the oppressed&quot; and the party of &quot;all weak, poor, and unemployed&quot;. However, the main priority of the party became extending its popularity amongst the rural electorate, thus becoming the main opponent of the Polish People&#x27;s Party. While ultimately Lepper only won 3% of the popular vote in the election, Samoobrona was able to extend its appeal and build a support base ahead of the 2001 election. Ongoing farmer protests between 2000 and 2001 popularized slogans such as &quot;Tomorrow will be Lepper&quot;, and after the 2000 election, 17% of voters polled believed that Lepper should have received more votes. Lepper also courted trade unions, attending pickets of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions and speaking of his concept of the &quot;workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; alliance&quot; that he wanted to materialize through Samoobrona.

The 2000 election also sparked the exodus of some Polish People&#x27;s Party activists to Samoobrona, which was escalated by Samoobrona&#x27;s pledge that defectors will be considered for prominent positions in the party ranks. The defectors from Polish People&#x27;s Party included Wojciech Mojzesowicz, who left PSL and joined Samoobrona after he lost the elections for the chairmanships of the PSL&#x27;s regional Bygdoszcz structures. After joining Samoobrona, Mojzesowicz became seen as the opposite of Andrzej Lepper, in spite of their childhood friendship. Mojzesowicz says to have seen Samoobrona as a laborist, radical party with a &quot;nationalist tint&quot;, but claims that the party lost its agrarian nature after the 2001 Polish parliamentary election. Feeling powerless to manage the political direction of the party, Mojzesowicz left Samoobrona in 2003 as one of its MPs, and initially considered joining the Polish People&#x27;s Party.

The Polish People&#x27;s Block was formed as a result of the withdrawal of Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland MP Wojciech Mojzesowicz and a small group of MPs associated with him. Members of the circle formed on 6 December 2002 became Wacław Klukowski, Dorota Kwaśniewska, Wojciech Mojzesowicz and Lech Zielonka. In March 2003, they were joined by Bożena Kozłowska and in July of the same year by Piotr Smolana. The party was reported to the register of political parties on 4 June 2003, and registered on 23 July of the same year.

After the coalition of social-democratic Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Polish People&#x27;s Party was dissolved on 3 March 2003 following disputes over agrarian tariffs and farmers&#x27; protests, the SLD began looking for a new coalition partner. The first considered partner was the People&#x27;s Democratic Party () of Roman Jagieliński, another Samoobrona defector. Jagieliński already served as the minister of agriculture between 1995 and 1997, and was therefore considered an experienced and well-respected candidate. Jagieliński started talks with the Polish Peasant Bloc as well, hoping that the PBL would also enter a coalition with the SLD. Samoobrona itself ruled out joining a coalition, but stated that it would be open to renewing its supply and confidence agreement depending on SLD&#x27;s coalition partner. However, ultimately SLD formed a minority government with the pro-European Labour Union.

In June 2003, the new minority government faced a vote of confidence. The ruling coalition gathered 224 votes by mid-June, as it could count on the support of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party and the German Minority Electoral Committee. On behalf of the Polish Peasant Bloc, Mojzesowicz declared that he would support the new government (bringing the vote up to 229), if SLD dismissed its minister of agriculture Adam Tański. Mojzesowicz criticized Tański&#x27;s policies, accusing him of selling Polish grain for low prices to foreign capital. The minority SLD-UP government managed to pass the vote of confidence by 236 votes (out of 231), thanks to the support of Samoobrona. In case of the Polish Peasant Bloc, 4 out of the 5 MPs of PBL voted for the government, while Mojzesowicz himself voted against it, as Tański was not dismissed.

In 2004 the PBL supported Marek Belka&#x27;s candidacy as Prime Minister. In January 2004, the Polish People&#x27;s Bloc Parliamentary Club agreed to merge with the Polish People&#x27;s Party (PSL)., resulting in the formation of the joint PSL-PBL Parliamentary Club in March, which, however, existed only until April, when the Polish People&#x27;s Bloc withdrew from this coalition. In the 2004 European Parliament election in Poland, PBL came to an agreement with League of Polish Families (LPR), as a result of which Wacław Klukowski (Polish Peasant Bloc&#x27;s MEP from 1 May to 19 July 2004, not belonging to any European faction), was on the LPR list in the Gorzów district, but he did not obtain a seat. In May, Lech Zielonka joined the Federated Parliamentary Club, and in June the circle was also abandoned by Bożena Kozłowska and Dorota Kwaśniewska, as a result of which its size decreased to 3 MPs. On 22 November of the same year, the party was deregistered, and in January 2005 the Polish Peasant Bloc also ceased to exist as a parliamentary circle. Most of the party&#x27;s activists then joined Law and Justice (PiS). Mojzesowicz became a prominent MP in Law and Justice, and was one of the main authors of the party&#x27;s agrarian program.

In March 2014, the Polish People&#x27;s Bloc was reactivated as an informal grouping. This followed the departure of activists from this milieu from Poland Together (previously, after leaving PiS in 2009, they had worked with Civic Platform and in 2010 co-founded Poland Comes First, which after dissolution in 2013 co-foundedPoland Together; Wojciech Mojzesowicz was vice-president of Poland Comes First and treasurer of Poland Together). The president of the reactivated Polish Peasant Bloc became Wacław Klukowski. On 15 March, the grouping reached an agreement with Sovereign Poland ahead of the 2014 European Parliament election in Poland. Wacław Klukowski ran for the Sejm in 2015 from the New Hope list, in 2018 he co-founded the Peasants&#x27; Party (which entered into an alliance with the Democratic Left Alliance), and later became an activist of the informal Farmers&#x27; Confederation (, KRK), established in 2019, which by 2021 was part of the Confederation Liberty and Independence (with which Wojciech Mojzesowicz, who is vice-president of the Farmers&#x27; Confederation, had previously been associated).

== Ideology ==
According to the party, the main reason behind leaving Samoobrona and creating a separate political structure was the perceived failure of Samoobrona to stay loyal and consistently realize its own political program, which the Polish Peasant Bloc supported in principle. The Polish Peasant Bloc also argued that Samoobrona lacks internal democracy, and that the party works on the basis of &quot;one-man rule&quot;, with Andrzej Lepper having allegedly absolute power. Despite stating its intention to realize the program of Samoobrona, the party greatly different from it in that the Polish Peasant Bloc described itself as neither left-wing nor right-wing, but rather broadly agrarian. This was in great contrast to the far-left and socialist nature of Samoobrona. The Polish Peasant Bloc aspired to create a united agrarian bloc in Poland.

The party adhered a Christian democratic ideology, in line with the tradition of the interwar chadecja movement. The Polish Peasant Bloc believed that the 1980s and 1990s agrarian protests and their legacy were being forgotten in Poland, and it wished to represent them and carry out the proposals of the main agrarian movements from that period. The party had ambigous stance towards socialism, but it argued that neither Poland nor the Polish agrarian movement should reject its socialist legacy. The leader of the party, Wojciech Mojzesowicz, argued that the label of socialism should not be a shameful one.

<text>Kotharat (, &quot;kṯrt&quot;) were a group of seven goddesses associated with conception, pregnancy, birth and marriage, worshiped chiefly in northern part of modern Syria in the Bronze Age. They are attested in texts from Mari, Ugarit and Emar. There is no agreement among translators over whether they had individual names in Ugaritic tradition. They were considered analogous to the Mesopotamian Šassūrātu, a collective term referring to assistants of the goddess Ninmah, and to Hurrian Hutena and Hutellura. It has been suggested that the latter were at least in part patterned after the Kotharat.

==Name==
The name Kotharat (Kôṯarātu) is a conventional vocalization of Ugaritic &quot;kṯrt&quot;. Spellings such as Kathiratu and Katiratu is also used in modern literature. Other forms of the name of the Kotharat are attested in texts from Mari: the older Kawašurātum (&quot;dkà-ma-šu-ra-tum&quot;) and more recent Kûšarātum (&quot;dku-ša-ra-tum&quot;). In Emar, they were known as &quot;Ilū kašarāti&quot; (DINGIRMEŠ &quot;ka-ša-ra-ti&quot;). All of these names are most likely derived from the Semitic root &quot;kšr&quot;, &quot;to be skilled&quot; or &quot;to achieve,&quot; which is attested in West Semitic languages and in Akkadian. Its other derivatives include the name of the god Kothar, the Ugaritic word &quot;kṯr&quot;, &quot;wise&quot; or &quot;cunning,&quot; and Hebrew &quot;kôšārāh&quot;, &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;prosperity.&quot; Possible cognates, &quot;ku-ša-ri&quot; and &quot;ku-šar&quot;, have also been identified among theophoric elements known from Akkadian personal names.

Ugaritic texts indicate that the word Kotharat is plural, and it is conventionally assumed that it refers to a group of seven goddesses. However, occasionally smaller number, either four or six, is postulated as an alternative.

===Possible individual names===
Individual names of the Kotharat might be attested in the Ugaritic myth &quot;Marriage of Nikkal and Yarikh&quot;. Gabriele Theuer restores them as follows: &quot;ṯlḫh&quot;, &quot;mlgh&quot;, &quot;yṯtqt&quot;, &quot;bq’t&quot;, &quot;tq’t&quot;, &quot;prbḫṯ&quot;, &quot;dmqt&quot;. Wilfred G. E. Watson gives a similar list, but excludes &quot;yṯtqt&quot;. However, not all experts agree that these words are given names. Theuer, who accepts that each of these words is the name of a single goddess, considers &quot;ṯlḫh&quot; either a cognate of Hebrew &quot;šillûḥîm&quot;, which might refer to dowry, or alternatively of Akkadian &quot;šalāḫu&quot;, &quot;to tear out,&quot; which she assumes might indirectly refer to removing the infant from mother&#x27;s womb. She points out the similarity between &quot;mlgh&quot; and Akkadian &quot;mulugu&quot;, a term referring to the property a bride brought from her father&#x27;s house. The word &quot;yṯtqt&quot; might be derived from the root &quot;ṯtq&quot;, possibly &quot;to split off,&quot; &quot;to separate,&quot; and as such designate the goddess as a responsible for cutting the umbilical cord. Similarly, the root &quot;bq’&quot;, from which &quot;bq’t&quot; might be derived, refers to splitting, and possibly refers specifically to splitting the womb in this context. The term &quot;tq’t&quot; is most likely derived from &quot;tq’&quot;, &quot;to hit with a hand,&quot; presumably referring to enthusiastically clapping hands to celebrate the birth of a child or possibly indirectly alluding to determination of a favorable fate. The compound &quot;prbḫṯ&quot; according to Theuer is presently impossible to translate and might be a Hurrian loanword in Ugaritic. Finally &quot;dmqt&quot;, seemingly designated as the youngest of the Kotharat, might mean &quot;the good&quot; or &quot;the kind&quot; and like &quot;tq’t&quot; refer to the ability to determine a positive fate for the infant. Aicha Rahmouni assumes that &quot;dmqt&quot; might instead refer to the whole group, not necessarily to a single goddess, and translates it as either &quot;fairest ones&quot; or &quot;fairest one.&quot;

Another translator, David Marcus, does not assume that the passage refers to individual goddesses: 
He argues that &quot;prbḫṯ&quot; is the name of a mortal woman, presumably a bride, poetically compared to one of the Kotharat. This interpretation is also supported by John Gibson, who presumes the Kotharat are invoked to bless her in her marriage. He considers it possible that the text was recited during wedding ceremonies in Ugarit and the name &quot;prbht&quot; is simply a placeholder.

==Character==
The Kotharat were chiefly associated with conception, pregnancy and birth. They were believed to be responsible for forming human children during pregnancy. Additionally, literary texts indicate that they blessed marriages. They are also sometimes characterized as divine midwives in modern literature. However, Dennis Pardee objects to this description, arguing that in known myths the Kotharat appear to only intervene before pregnancy.

One of the Ugaritic texts describes them with the term &quot;snnt&quot;. Especially in older literature, it is often assumed to be a cognate of Akkadian &quot;sinuntu&quot;, &quot;swallow.&quot; However, many researchers, for example Dennis Pardee and Aicha Rahmouni, favor the explanation &quot;shining&quot; or &quot;brilliant,&quot; based on similarity to Arabic &quot;sanā&quot;, &quot;to shine,&quot; &quot;to gleam&quot; or &quot;to be exalted&quot; (used to refer to stars), as well as its Aramaic cognate referring to refining metal or glittering. The proponents of the latter theory point out that there is no precedent for Ancient Near Eastern deities being referred to as &quot;swallows,&quot; while various epithets highlighting luminosity are attested in Mesopotamian and Eblaite texts, as well as in the Hebrew Bible.

==Associations with other deities==
According to Ugaritic texts, the god &quot;hll&quot; was the father of the Kotharat. The vocalization of his name is uncertain, though a god named Hulelu, whose origin is presently unknown, was worshiped in Emar and might be related to Ugaritic &quot;hll&quot;. The meaning of the name is not known, though a similarity with the Arabic word &quot;hilālun&quot;, &quot;crescent moon&quot;, has been pointed out. Based on this possible relation he is often considered an astral deity, possibly a lunar god specifically associated with the crescent phase. Another proposed translation of his name is &quot;star.&quot; Dennis Pardee instead suggests the name might mean &quot;purity,&quot; while Wilfred G. E. Watson favors &quot;brightness.&quot; Yet another theory connects &quot;hll&quot; with the senior Mesopotamian god Enlil.

Lists of deities from Ugarit and Mari indicate that the Kotharat were understood as analogous to the Lower Mesopotamian Šassūrātu. The sources from the former site additionally attest an equivalence between them and Hurrian Hutena and Hutellura. The term &quot;Šassūrātu&quot; refers to goddesses regarded as helpers of Ninmah. Both they and the Kotharat appear in offering lists from Mari. Their name is derived from the Akkadian word &quot;šassūru&quot;, a direct loan from Sumerian meaning &quot;womb&quot; or &quot;midwife.&quot; They appear in the myth &quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot;, where the members of this group are Ninimma, Shuzianna, Ninmada, Ninšar, Ninmug and Ninnigina. They are collectively characterized as &quot;wise and knowing.&quot; The latter names refer to a group of Hurrian deities believed to be responsible for determining the fate of humans, also associated with birth and midwifery. Alfonso Archi considers it possible that the Hurrians living in Syria patterned them on the Kotharat and their Mesopotamian counterparts. He assumes that they were a heptad of deities, much like the Kotharat, which is a position also supported by Volkert Haas. However, Piotr Taracha remarks that while both &quot;Hutena&quot; and &quot;Hutellura&quot; are grammatically plural, on the Yazılıkaya reliefs only two figures are identified by them. He also points out that in some cases Hutellura was seemingly treated as a singular goddess analogous to Ninmah. 

Wilfred G. E. Watson argues that in the myth &quot;Marriage of Nikkal and Yarikh&quot; (KTU 1.24), the Kotharat function as handmaidens of the eponymous goddess. 

Despite their names being cognates, there is no direct indication in any known sources that the Kotharat were ever associated with the god Kothar.

==Worship==
The Kotharat originated in inland Syria. They were worshiped by Amorites in various cities located in the north of this region. According to Alfonso Archi, they spread through the Middle Euphrates area in the early second millennium BCE. They are attested in offering lists from Mari. They were also worshiped in Emar, though there is no indication that they had a temple there and they are absent from known theophoric names. Marten Stol also tentatively suggests that a relief from Tell Chuera depicting seven goddesses might be an indication that the Kotharat or a similar group of birth goddesses were worshiped in this location.

The Ugaritic texts also mention the Kotharat. Wilfred G. E. Watson counts them among the principal goddesses of this city of local origin alongside Anat, Ashtart, Athirat and Shapash. In two similar lists of deities (one fragmented), they appear between the pair Arṣu-wa-Šamuma (&quot;Earth and Heaven&quot;) and the moon god Yarikh. A single possible theophoric name invoking the Kotharat, &quot;bn kṯrt&quot;, has been identified as well.

===Uncertain and disproved attestations===
Dennis Pardee argues that the genealogy of deities presented by Philo of Byblos might reflect one of the Ugaritic deity list, in which the Kotharat appear after Ilib, Arṣu-wa-Šamuma (&quot;Earth and Heaven&quot;) and El, before Dagan. The late Phoenician author mentions seven daughters of Elos/Kronos alongside Elyon, the pair Ge and Ouranos, and Dagon. He additionally argues that the Ugaritic list might reflect a tradition in which their father was El. However, Lluís Feliu concludes that the presence of Kotharat in this document might be the result of a scribal mistake: &quot;kṯrt&quot; in place of &quot;aṯrt&quot; (Athirat), the wife of El. He points out that in an analogous list written in the syllabic cuneiform script, the deity occurring between El and Dagan is designated by the logogram dNIN.MAH, which according to him never designated groups of deities such as Kotharat or Šassūrātu, and as such might refer to a singular deity, the wife of El, instead. 

Two purported attestations of the Kotharat postulated by William F. Albright, on a tablet from Beth Shemesh and in verse 7 of Psalm 68, are no longer accepted in modern scholarship.

==Mythology==
The Kotharat are among the deities appearing in the Ugaritic myth &quot;Marriage of Nikkal and Yarikh&quot;, sometimes referred to with the title &quot;Nikkal and the Kotharat&quot; instead. They apparently oversee the birth of a son of Nikkal and Yarikh, and might also be invoked to bless a mortal woman, &quot;prbḫṯ&quot; due to her own upcoming wedding, though it has also been proposed that the passage enumerates the individual names of the Kotharat.

They also appear in the &quot;Epic of Aqhat&quot;. They visit the house of Danilu after Baal intercedes on his behalf with El, and grants him a descendant, the hero of the narrative, Aqhat. Danilu holds a six day long feast in their honor. On the seventh day they leave. It is possible they later return to act as midwives during the birth of Aqhat, though this assumption is speculative as a section of the story presumed to describe these events is missing.

<text>LIU Post, formally the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University and often referred to as C.W. Post, is a private university in Brookville, New York, on Long Island. It is part of Long Island University (LIU), and the largest university in the LIU system.

The campus is named after C.W. Post, father of Marjorie Merriweather Post, who sold her Long Island estate known as Hillwood to Long Island University in 1951 for $200,000 ($ today). Three years after acquiring the property, LIU renamed it C.W. Post College in honor of Post&#x27;s father.

== Campus ==
LIU Post is located on of rolling hills in Brookville, New York, on Long Island&#x27;s North Shore. The area is sometimes datelined as Greenvale, because there is no &quot;Brookville&quot; post office, and the school is in the zip code that is served by the Greenvale post office, which is to the west. Greenvale station is the nearest Long Island Rail Road station.

Humanities Hall and Life Sciences/Pell Hall are the main educational buildings on campus, and house most of the core curriculum classes. Classes are also held in Hoxie Hall, Roth Hall, Lorber Hall, the Theater Film and Dance building, Sculpture Studio, Crafts Center, Fine Arts Center, B. Davis Schwartz Memorial Library, and the Kahn Discovery Center.

The Tilles Center for the Performing Arts is on the west side of the campus. Previously known as the Bush-Brown Concert Theater (named for the longtime Long Island University chancellor Dr. Albert Bush-Brown), the Tilles Center has hosted many musical and theatrical events.

The Hillwood Commons serves as the student activities center, and also has several administrative offices, including financial aid and bursars office, as well as the Promise office which handles all student day-to-day activities (classes, student organizations, housing, etc). Hillwood has a study lounge, commuter lounge, recreation lounge, and TV lounge (located on opposite sides of the two-story building) that are open as long as Hillwood is open. The Hillwood Cafe, Subway, and Starbucks are all located here and serve as the main dining areas, along with the Winnick Student Center serving as the single dining hall on campus for residential students.

The Hillwood Commons serves as a meeting area for resident and commuter students to get to know each other through informal association outside of the classroom. The Hillwood Commons area also houses the Campus Concierge, Hillwood Computer Lab, Hillwood Cinema, School Bookstore, and multiple student run businesses, such as Browse (electronics store), The Student Body Collective (Clothing boutique), and Sharknation (merchandise shop).

The university&#x27;s C.W. Post Interfaith Chapel is home of the Interfaith Center, which provides both religious services as well as partnerships with community organizations. The chapel was first conceived in 1968 by Bradley Delehanty and completed by the noted Long Island architectural firm Alfred Shaknis and Peter S. van Bloem in the classic Jeffersonian style Georgian architecture design as a tribute to all religious faiths. Included among its notable architectural features are a domed rotunda at the main sanctuary, as well as soaring Doric columns at the main entrance which call to mind the ancient Roman Pantheon.

== Residence life ==
Students may live in one of the eight residence halls on campus. All are co-ed with males and females divided by floor or wing. Each hall accommodates from 40 to 380 students. Suffolk, Kings, Queens, and Nassau Halls form the &quot;Freshman Quad&quot;/ and all first year students residing on campus are required to dorm in these buildings.

The South Residence Complex, also known as the Suites, feature an all-suite design with up to eight students sharing a common living area, double bedrooms, and a semi-private bath area. Every residence hall has lounges for relaxation or study and laundry facilities.

The weekly student newspaper, &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, has reported that many of the dorms are poorly maintained by students. In 2007, a dorm room in Riggs Hall was completely scorched by an electrical fire. Students were not in the room at the time, but their belongings were destroyed. The school claimed no responsibility, although residents told the student newspaper they had complained about black outlets shortly before the fire.

In 2006, C.W. Post Residence Life was sued for dismissing a group of residential associations, who made a video exercising their freedom of speech. The students retained an attorney in their defense, and the university agreed to pay their legal fees if the students dropped the lawsuit and signed a non-disclosure agreement.

== Academics ==

LIU Post offers undergraduate and graduate programs in the following colleges and schools:

* College of Communications, Art, and Design
* College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* College of Management
* College of Education, Information and Technology
* School of Health Professions and Nursing

== Rebranding campaign ==
In January 2012, Long Island University rebranded itself as LIU. A simplified logo was introduced, replacing the Long Island map and the words &quot;Long Island University&quot; with the bold letters &quot;LIU&quot; and a triangle. The logo&#x27;s upward triangle, the Greek symbol of delta, symbolizes upward movement and change. The names of LIU&#x27;s six campuses also received shorter designations, uniting them under the new LIU brand. The C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University became known as LIU Post.

== Accreditations ==
LIU Post is registered with the New York State Education Department and accredited by the Commission of Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Various academic programs are specially accredited by professional organizations. Organizations that professionally accredit LIU Post programs include:
* American Art Therapy Association
* American Library Association
* American Psychological Association
* American Speech–Language–Hearing Association
* Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business
* Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
* Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs in cooperation with the Council on Accreditation of the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)
* Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education
* Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs
* Council on Social Work Education

LIU Post is located about east from New York City, the nation&#x27;s largest city. Students can participate in various clubs, organizations, and student leadership opportunities.
Students at the university predominantly come from eastern Long Island, New York City, and the New York metropolitan area, and there are a smaller number of students from elsewhere in the nation and from foreign nations.

The university has eight Greek Life organizations on campus: Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Xi Delta, Delta Zeta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Delta Tau, and Tau Kappa Epsilon.

== Athletics ==

Long Island University&#x27;s athletic programs are the LIU Sharks. They compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association at the Division I level, the highest level of collegiate athletics. Prior to 2019, the university&#x27;s athletic programs competed at the Division II level. The programs are governed by the NCAA, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the East Coast Conference (ECC), and the Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10). Prior to 2019, the two LIU campuses had two athletics teams, C.W. Post had the LIU Post Pioneers, and competed in Division II. The LIU campus in Brooklyn competed at the Division I level as the Blackbirds.

In July 2019, the two campuses merged their two athletics teams into a single unit competing in Division I, and assumed the name LIU Sharks.

In addition to its NCAA-sanctioned athletic programs, students may participate in various sports, including basketball, racquetball, swimming, and volleyball, for leisure at the Pratt Recreation Center. There is a fitness center for aerobic and cardiovascular workouts on the campus. The athletic fields and courts are used for recreational baseball, football, soccer, softball, and tennis.

The Pratt Center also serves as one of the Nassau County venues for New York State high school boys and girls basketball playoff games.

<text>La vache qui tache (English: &quot;the cow that stains&quot;) is a party game that originated in France. The only prop required is a cork, one end of which has been blackened by a candle flame.

Assign each player a number. Player one calls out &quot;Je suis la vache qui tache sans taches numéro 1 et j&#x27;appelle la vache sans taches numéro X&quot; (&quot;I am the cow who spots with zero spots number 1, and I call the cow with zero spots number X&quot;), where X is the number of any other player. When the game first starts no-one has any spots, so the number of spots is zero, or &quot;sans tache&quot;. The next player, X, must immediately repeat the phrase, using his/her own number and another player for X (&quot;I am the spotted cow with zero spots number X, and I call the cow with zero spots number Y&quot;), where Y is the number of any other player. The game repeats this way until someone makes a mistake.

If a player makes a mistake, like mixing up the cow numbers, taking too long to respond, or calling the wrong number of spots, that player gets &quot;spotted&quot;, using the blackened cork to make a big round black dot on their face. If a player gets one spot, then that player must say &quot;I am the spotted cow with one spot...&quot; and so on for the number of spots received.

Each mistake earns a player another spot, and both the player&#x27;s number of spots and the number of spots of the player called must be taken into account every time a player is called. The game may continue indefinitely or end when someone gets a certain number of spots.

A French idiom for being falling-down-drunk is &quot;black faced&quot; in reference to this game.

==Ibble Dibble==
Ibble Dibble, or Ripple Tipple in Australasia, is an English variant. It also involves marking people&#x27;s faces with a blackened cork or a similar substance such as peanut butter.

Ibble Dibble is similar, with one variant using the name of the person instead of a number. For example: &quot;I am Ibble Dibble Kyle with no Dibble Ibbles calling Ibble Dibble Kate with one Dibble Ibble.&quot; Another variant is referring to &quot;spots,&quot; saying &quot;I&#x27;m number one spot, I&#x27;ve got no spots, how many spots has number X spot got?&quot;.

==Commercialisation==
In 2004 &quot;la vache qui tache&quot; was made into a commercial party game, distributed by Jeux F.K.

<text>The Florida Flame was an NBA Development League team based in Fort Myers, Florida.

The Flame announced they would temporarily shut down operations during 2006–07, due to not having a home arena in which to play. The team maintained its league membership in hopes of finding a venue for the next season. When that didn&#x27;t happen, the Flame quietly folded all operations in late 2007.

== Franchise history ==
The North Charleston Lowgators began play in the National Basketball Development League in 2001–02. Alex English served as the coach for the inaugural season. The team was renamed the Charleston Lowgators in the fall of 2003. The Charleston Lowgators relocated to Fort Myers in fall 2004 and became the Florida Flame. In September 2005, the NBA announced that the Flame would be affiliated with the Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Orlando Magic for the upcoming season.

<text>The Fayetteville Patriots were an NBA Development League team based in Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States.

== Franchise history ==
In 2001, the Fayetteville Patriots became one of the National Basketball Development League&#x27;s eight charter franchises. Jeff Capel II was hired as coach. They played their home games at the Cumberland County Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The league would later re-brand as the NBA Development League (or D-League) in 2005.

Capel left after the 2004–05 season. The Patriots finished last in the D-League in the 2005–06 season with a 16–32 record. They got a lift in late February and early March, with the acquisition of Amir Johnson and Alex Acker from the Detroit Pistons. On May 2, 2006, the D-League decided to no longer field a team in Fayetteville. The announcement came a day after the league decided the same fate for the Roanoke Dazzle franchise, based in Roanoke, Virginia.

<text>The Roanoke Dazzle were an 
NBA Development League team based in Roanoke, Virginia, U.S. In operation from the inaugural D-League season of 2001–02 through the 2005–06 season, the Dazzle marked the return of professional basketball to Roanoke since the Virginia Squires called Roanoke home in the 1970s. Playing their home games at the Roanoke Civic Center, their logo design featured a star moving on rail tracks around a basketball.

==Franchise history==
The NBDL initially announced that Roanoke was under consideration for one of the inaugural teams in August 2000. Competing with Hampton for Virginia&#x27;s NBDL team, Roanoke was evaluated as a potential franchise location based on its population, arena size and lack of a major NCAA basketball program in the Roanoke Valley. After reaching an agreement to play home games at the Roanoke Civic Center, the NBDL announced Roanoke as the league&#x27;s fifth member on May 18, 2001. The announcement marked the return of professional basketball to Roanoke since the departure of the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Virginia Squires following the 1972–73 season.

By June 2001, Donna Daniels was named team president and Kent Davison was announced as the first head coach in franchise history. On July 18, 2001, Daniels announced the team nickname, the Dazzle. The name was chosen purposefully to not reflect Roanoke&#x27;s railroad heritage as two other professional teams, the Roanoke Express and the Roanoke Steam, already called the civic center home. The Dazzle would be victorious in the inaugural game on November 18, 2001, against the Mobile Revelers in the Roanoke Civic Center.

After five seasons, and overall moderate success on the court, the Dazzle were one of the final two teams from the NBDL inaugural season to last through the 2005–06 season. The Fayetteville Patriots were the other. Both were owned by the NBA for their entire five season history. On May 1, 2006, the NBA Development League announced that the NBA would no longer operate the Roanoke Dazzle. League President Phil Evans briefly held out the possibility of a local ownership group operating the team. However, when a local ownership group failed to materialize, the team was disbanded.

<text>The Greenville Groove were a National Basketball Development League (NBDL) team based in Greenville, South Carolina. Playing their home games at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena, the Groove was a charter franchise of the league, which had four teams based in the Carolinas. They were the league champions for the inaugural 2001–02 season but the team folded after the 2002–03 season.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) announced the Groove as one of the NBDL&#x27;s charter franchises in July 2001. On August 16, 2001, the team announced that Stephanie Ready would serve as the team&#x27;s lone assistant coach in becoming the first woman to serve as a coach on an all-male professional basketball team. Milton Barnes served as head coach of the first season and won the championship before leaving to become coach of the Harlem Globetrotters. The team had won the inaugural NBDL title in defeating the North Charleston Lowgators two games to zero.

Tree Rollins was tapped to serve as the new head coach. However, the league contracted the franchise in June 2003. Its contraction was carried out by the league due to low attendance and increasing operating losses.

<text>The Lewis River is a tributary of the Columbia River, about long, in southwestern Washington in the United States. It drains part of the Cascade Range north of the Columbia River. The drainage basin of the Lewis River covers about . The river&#x27;s mean annual discharge is about . Unlike nearby Lewis County and Fort Lewis the Lewis River was not named for Meriwether Lewis, but rather for A. Lee Lewis, an early pioneer who homesteaded near the mouth of the river.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the Lewis drainage were a number of Native American tribes. Tribal listings compiled by anthropologist Verne F. Ray mention a village about upstream from the mouth of the Lewis, which was originally populated by the Cowlitz, but transitioned after 1830 to a Klickitat population. Lewis and Clark encountered a tribe on the Lewis River that they referred to as &quot;Cathlapotles,&quot; which are thought to be Chinook, but they also recorded a Sahaptin-speaking village near the mouth of the Lewis, which were likely Klickitat people. Like almost all Native tribes, Indigenous groups on the Lewis River experienced a population collapse as a result of an 1830 epidemic introduced by early colonizers. This is one of the reasons many early recorded observations include large shifts and changes in tribal populations.

One of the first recorded sightings of the Lewis by a non Indigenous person was in 1792, when William Robert Broughton passed the mouth of the Lewis while exploring the Columbia River during the Vancouver Expedition. He named it Rushleigh&#x27;s River at that time. At the time Lewis and Clark crossed the river, they had already named the Snake River the Lewis, and referred to the present-day Lewis as the Cathlapoote. Other historically recorded names include the Kattlepoutal and Washington River.

The Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 brought an influx of colonizers to the region, but just prior to that in 1845, Adolphus Lee Lewis retired from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and established a land claim near present day Woodland. Lewis became the county surveyor in 1856, and applied his own name to the river.

==Course==

The Lewis River rises in the Cascades in northeastern Skamania County, high on the west flank of Mount Adams, approximately northeast of Portland, Oregon. It flows generally southwest through Gifford Pinchot National Forest, across central Skamania County, passing south of Mount St. Helens. It forms the boundary, along the Dark Divide on its north side, between Cowlitz County, to the north, and Clark County, to the south. Towns along the river include Cougar, Ariel, and Woodland. In its lower , it turns sharply south, then west, and enters the Columbia from the east, opposite St. Helens, Oregon, approximately north of Vancouver, Washington. The mouth of the Lewis River is at Columbia river mile (RM) 87 or river kilometer (RK) 140.

Near the confluence with the Columbia River, the Lewis River is joined by the East Fork Lewis River. The main Lewis River, sometimes called the North Fork Lewis River, forms the boundary between Clark and Cowlitz counties, while the East Fork divides Clark County in half. The East Fork flows westward from headwaters on the western flanks of Lookout Mountain in Skamania County. Parks along the East Fork include Moulton Falls, Lucia Falls, Lewisville, and Paradise Point. A variant name of the East Fork is the South Fork Lewis River.

==River modifications==
The North Fork is impounded for hydroelectricity and flood control in its middle course by Swift Dam, forming Swift Reservoir; Yale Dam, forming Yale Lake; and Merwin Dam, forming Lake Merwin.

Horseshoe Lake in Woodland is a former oxbow of the North Fork. Beginning in 1940, the construction of U.S. Highway 99 (later to become the Interstate 5 corridor in this area), resulted in the construction of a dike that straightened the river to the east of the highway before it flows under what is now Interstate 5 near the Woodland southern boundary.

<doc id="773662" wikidata="Q7762029" url="?curid=773662" title="The Sage Colleges">
<text>The Sage Colleges were a private educational institution comprising three institutions in New York State: 
Russell Sage College, a women&#x27;s college in Troy; Sage College of Albany, a co-educational college in Albany; and the Sage Graduate School, which operated both in Troy and in Albany. After a 2020 merger the institutions continue under the single name, Russell Sage College.

==History==
The first of the colleges to be established was Russell Sage College, which was founded in 1916 by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage as a &quot;School of Practical Arts&quot;. Russell Sage was always a comprehensive college, offering both professional and liberal arts degrees. It consistently been ranked in the top ten comprehensive colleges in the Northeast by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. A &quot;Men&#x27;s Division&quot; was established during World War II, and the first graduate degree was conferred by the college in 1942. In 1949 the &quot;Albany Division&quot; was founded as a second, coeducational campus, offering associate, bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. In 1957 the two-year program, under the name &quot;Sage Junior College of Albany&quot;, was granted authority to offer its own degrees. In 1995, the Sage Graduate School was given permission to grant degrees independently, the Sage Evening College was recognized as a separate educational entity, and the four elements of Sage were rechartered together as The Sage Colleges. In 2002 the two-year college and the evening college were subsumed in a new four-year college of professional studies, Sage College of Albany. The three colleges, all part of the corporate institution The Sage Colleges, were governed by a common president, Dr. Christopher Ames, and a common Board of Trustees; each college had its own academic dean.

Due to declining enrollment and a high amount of debt, The Sage Colleges board of directors voted unanimously in March 2019 to merge the three colleges as one institution and rebrand Sage as Russell Sage College beginning in the fall of 2020.

==Athletics==
The Sage Colleges teams participated as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Gators were a member of the Empire 8. Men&#x27;s sports (Sage College of Albany) included basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports (Russell Sage College) included basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball.

<doc id="773667" wikidata="Q545672" url="?curid=773667" title="Henri Laborit">
<text>Henri Laborit (21 November 1914 – 18 May 1995) was a French surgeon, neurobiologist, writer and philosopher. In 1952, Laborit was instrumental in the development of the drug chlorpromazine, published his findings, and convinced three psychiatrists to test it on a patient, resulting in great success. Laborit was recognized for his work, but as a surgeon searching for an anesthetic, he came to be at odds with psychiatrists who made their own discoveries and competing claims.

Laborit wrote several books where he popularizes his ethological laboratory research and marries it, through systems thinking, with knowledge from several other disciplines, being a strong advocate of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. His writings can also be found to have deep roots in anarchist thought. He was personally untroubled by the requirements of science and the constraints of university life. He maintained an independence from academia and never sought to produce the orderly results that science requires of its adherents.

==Family and early years==
Henri Laborit was born in Hanoi, French Indochina, in 1914. His father was a physician and colonial officer who died in 1920 from tetanus. Laborit contracted tuberculosis at age 12. In Paris, he earned a baccalaureate. He spent two years in Indochina on a hospital ship. He passed the examinations at the Naval Health Service in Bordeaux, and became a navy physician. He was sent to Sidi Abdallah, Bizerte. Feeling that his options for recognition would be better, he switched to become a surgeon. During World War II he was stationed on the torpedo boat Sirocco, where he witnessed the evacuation of the Dunkerque, and then was sunk by the Germans. He was saved by an English sloop that picked him up. He received the French Military Cross with distinction. He was later stationed in Dakar. By about 1949 he was appointed to Val-de-Grâce hospital in Paris.

==Chlorpromazine==

Laborit was the first to recognize the potential psychiatric uses of chlorpromazine.
The science of anesthesiology was new since the 1930s. Surgeons were sometimes responsible for anesthetics and as a French navy surgeon, Laborit had seen patients die as a result of or after their operations. He became a researcher in anesthesiology. Laborit&#x27;s ideas on anesthesia included potentiated anaesthesia, lowering basal metabolism and lowering body temperature (so-called artificial hibernation). He advocated the use of procaine, synthetic antihistamines, Diparcol (diethazine), tetraethylammonium bromide and vitamin B1. He did not like to use morphine. In his years in Bizerte he became interested in the use of the antihistamine promethazine to make patients more relaxed before surgery and in contributing to anesthesia, observations that were the forerunner of his later interest in chlorpromazine.

With Pierre Huguenard, Laborit invented the lytic cocktail, a combination of drugs that could be given to patients to reduce the shock and stress they experienced during and after surgery. Huguenard had success with a combination of promethazine and pethidine, at the time under the trade names Diparcol and Dolossal, and told Laborit of his finding. Laborit thought that putting patients into a state of artificial hibernation would prevent some aspects of stress reactions. These drugs made bodies stop their reactions to cooling.

Laborit suggested to Rhône-Poulenc (a pharmaceutical company that became Sanofi) that they create antihistamines that optimized stabilization of the central nervous system. There, chemist Paul Charpentier headed a group trying to improve on the existing drug diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Dramamine, U.S. Sominex). So Charpentier created a new series of phenothiazines, one of them by adding a chlorine atom.
Simone Courvoisier tested the series on laboratory rats and discovered that RP 4560 (chlorinated promazine, later known as chlorpromazine) could reverse the effects of epinephrine and could induce a state of apathy or indifference. Rhône-Poulenc marketed the drug in Europe for vomiting, pain, nausea, and convulsions as Largactil in 1952. Laborit is said to have named the drug, a blended word for &quot;large activity&quot;.

He, Huguenard and an associate named R. Alluaume published &quot;A new vegetative stabilizer: 4560 RP.&quot; in &quot;La Presse Médicale&quot; in February 1952. According to Max Bennett, &quot;the effect of the drug to produce &#x27;disinterest&#x27; is mentioned together with the possibility that this property might make it of psychiatric use.&quot;

Immediately following its synthesis at Rhône-Poulenc in December 1951, Laborit requested a sample of 4560 RP to test for the purpose of reducing shock in injured soldiers. His observation that people treated with this drug showed reduced interest in their surroundings led him to suggest the first test of antipsychotics by Hamon, Paraire and Velluz. A 24-year-old patient with mania was released from Val-de-Grâce and ready &quot;to resume a normal life&quot; after 20 days treatment with chlorpromazine and barbiturates.

Although it had severe side effects, chlorpromazine &quot;helped change the face of serious mental illness&quot; and allowed many patients to live outside mental asylums; in the United States, the inpatient population of mental institutions dropped from 559,000 in 1955 to 452,000 ten years later.&quot;

==Lasker award==
Laborit shared the prestigious Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 1957 with Pierre Deniker and Heinz Lehmann for contributions towards the general use of chlorpromazine. No one won a Nobel Prize for the discovery, and Jean Delay of the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center, who wanted to win himself, sat on the Nobel committee but was opposed to giving it to Laborit. Laborit found himself at odds with Sainte-Anne hospital&#x27;s staff for the rest of his life.

In 1957, the Lasker Foundation also recognized Nathan S. Kline and Robert H. Noce, both of whom advanced reserpine as a treatment for mental illness, as well as Rustom Jal Vakil for treating hypertension with reserpine, and, unrelated, Richard E. Shope for pioneering our understanding of viruses.

==Career==
Laborit became director of the Laboratoire d&#x27;Eutonologie at Boucicault Hospital in Paris. His interests included psychotropic drugs and memory.

Alexander Zaytsev synthesized GHB in 1874, and Laborit synthesized the drug in 1960. He was researching GHB as a precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA. Laborit published &quot;Sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate&quot; in the &quot;International Journal of Neuropharmacology&quot; in September 1964.

==Awards and cultural references==
Laborit received the Croix de Guerre with distinction. He was elected a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1953. He received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award which he shared in 1957, after traveling to the United States on behalf of Rhône-Poulenc.

Laborit&#x27;s ideas are the substance of the Alain Resnais 1980 film &quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot; in which he plays himself.

Laborit interviewed Salvador Dalí about one of his books which Dalí had read but did not understand.

==Death and legacy==

Healy wrote that Laborit felt cheated of his recognition and that he died a bitter man. Healy noted a few attempts to set the record straight: a 1980 book by Jean Thuillier that credits Delay and Deniker and Laborit, a 1960s book by Ann Caldwell that sided with Laborit, and a 1974 book by Judith Swazey, &quot;Chlorpromazine in Psychiatry&quot;, which gave credit to both sides. A 1992 commemoration by Rhône-Poulenc gave Laborit credit for anesthesia but gave Deniker and Delay credit for application of chlorpromazine to psychiatry. In 1994, on the 200th anniversary of the founding of Val-de-Grâce, a plaque was placed there commemorating the discovery of chlorpromazine by Laborit, Harmon, Paraire, and Velluz in 1952.

Laborit was one of the pioneers of complexity theory and self-organization in France and the initiator of &quot;complex thought&quot; in his meetings with the &quot;Groupe des Dix&quot;. &quot;Complex thought&quot; was later popularized by Edgar Morin.

<doc id="773672" wikidata="Q2976121" url="?curid=773672" title="Compressed-air vehicle">
<text>A compressed-air vehicle (CAV) is a transport mechanism fueled by tanks of pressurized atmospheric gas and propelled by the release and expansion of the gas within a pneumatic motor.

CAV&#x27;s have found application in torpedoes, locomotives used in situations where standard locomotives are a hazard, and early prototype submarines.

Compressed-air vehicles operate according to a thermodynamic process in which air cools down when expanding and heats up when being compressed, resulting in unwanted energy losses. However, with recent developments in isothermal compressed air energy storage (ICAES) plants, compressed air storage has reached 3.6 MJ/m3 and four times the capacity factor of lithium-ion batteries with 2.7 MJ/kg. In 2020 there were developments published by Dr. Reza Alizade Evrin from Ontario Tech University with an isothermal compressed-air vehicle prototype that uses low-pressure air tanks and exhaust air recovery to power a paraffin heat exchanger system with a global energy efficiency of 74% and a driving range of . This efficiency and range can be increased by using storage tanks as vehicle structure, high-pressure tanks, new rotary engines, and a more efficient heat exchanger.

Compressed-air propulsion may also be incorporated in hybrid systems, such as with battery electric propulsion. This kind of system is &quot;hybrid pneumatic–electric&quot; propulsion. Regenerative braking can also be used in such systems.

== Compressed-air engines ==
In principle, any pneumatic motor can be used for a compressed-air vehicle, but some engines were specifically developed for this application and/or have specific advantages.

=== Di Pietro engine ===
There have been several dubious claims with undisclosed information.
However, the &quot;Di Pietro&quot; engine has been partially tested with CAD and finite element analysis program and published in scientific papers by Jarosław Zwierzchowski from Lodz University of Technology in 2017, which is an eccentric shaft vane motor that uses low air pressure.

=== Liquidpiston ===
Another recent engine that could be adapted to compressed air is Liquidpiston rotary engine.

== Compressed-air tanks and collision safety ==
The tanks must be designed to safety standards appropriate for a pressure vessel, such as ISO 11439.

The pressure vessels or air storage tanks that can be used in compressed-air vehicles can be made for low pressure () or high (more than ), and can be made of composite materials like thermoplastic and fiber-reinforced thermoplastics, that means that the price can drop by using recycled or biobased thermoplastics using rotational molding and they are much lighter than lithium-ion batteries and 70% lighter compared to steel tanks, also they have more lifespan and don&#x27;t need much maintenance.

To reduce vehicle weight further the air tanks can be used as structural storage so the tank is the main part of the vehicle chassis while using appropriate impact isolation, however fiber reinforced thermoplastic tanks only have ruptures in case of collision and don&#x27;t explode. Some advances in pressure vessels for vehicles have been developed for hydrogen vehicles with high compression pressure vessels. Automobile designer Hyundai states:Hydrogen tanks require ‘High Strength’ to prevent rupture and ‘High Stiffness’ for durability. Strength is defined as the level of resistance to an influence of an external force. Stiffness is the level of resistance maintaining its original shape. The carbon fiber materials used in making hydrogen fuel tanks is as light as a plastic but has six and four times the strength and stiffness of steel, respectively. “When a bullet penetrates a hydrogen tank, it does not explode. Instead, hydrogen leaks out through the bullet hole. In a standard collision test, not even a tiny amount of hydrogen was detected because none had leaked out.

== Compressed-air production, storage and energy efficiency and density ==

Compressed air has a low energy density, however near-isothermal compressed air storage ICAES can reach 3.6 MJ/m3 and has almost four times the energy density of lithium-ion batteries with 2.7 MJ/kg. 

Compressed air can be produced by attaching an air compressor or hydraulic pump to a wind turbine or using river, tidal, wave hydropower turbine with only a conversion from mechanical to pneumatic energy, eliminating electricity from the loop which gives higher efficiency overall.

Additionally, there is the possibility of using thermal energy with a parabolic or Fresnel lens solar concentrator to power a thermal Stirling engine to move the compressor or pump, as solar-powered Stirling engines are more efficient than solar steam and photovoltaic.

== Emissions ==
Since the compressed air is filtered to protect the compressor machinery, the air discharged has less suspended dust in it, though there may be carry-over of lubricants used in the compressor or engine. This can be mitigated by using oil-free air compressors.

== Resource consumption ==
The recent developments of composite pressure vessels and pneumatic components mean that compressed-air vehicles can be part of the circular industry with biobased or recycled components. Also, by cutting electric energy from the loop there is no need for an electric grid and the metals used like copper, iron in magnets, etc.

== History ==

Compressed air has been used since the 19th century to power mine locomotives and trams in cities such as Paris (via a central, city-level, compressed air energy distribution system), and was previously the basis of naval torpedo propulsion.

During the construction of the Gotthardbahn from 1872 to 1882, pneumatic locomotives were used in the construction of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel and other tunnels of the Gotthardbahn.

In 1903, the Liquid Air Company located in London, United Kingdom, manufactured several compressed-air and liquified-air cars. The major problem with these cars and all compressed-air cars is the lack of torque produced by the &quot;engines&quot; and the cost of compressing the air.

Since 2010, several companies have started to develop compressed air cars, including hybrid types that also include a petrol-driven engine; none has been released to the public, or have been tested by third parties.

== Advantages ==
With the efficiency of using wind turbines to power compressors or pumps, there is a single conversion of mechanical to pneumatic or hydraulic energy. Also, by powering the compressor with a Stirling engine using a parabolic or Fresnel lens solar concentrator, there is thermal to mechanical energy conversion. Lastly, by using a phase change material in the heat exchanger heated with concentrated solar power there is only solar thermal energy involved.

The most efficient compressed-air vehicle as of 2020 is an isothermal prototype at 74%, which is similar to the 73-90% of electric vehicles using lithium-ion batteries.

Compared to lithium-ion, isothermal compressed air energy storage (ICAES) can be at least 2.7 MJ/kg or 3.6 MJ/m3, 4 times of lithium-ion batteries, which can be improved with high-pressure vessels and heat exchanger systems.

Resources, compressed air technology can be adapted to renewable energy and circular industry with biobased or recycled composites and so compared to electric vehicles they can be exempt from finite mineral resources or toxic processes used in battery and electric motor manufacturing and also from the electric grid use. Refilling is possible in almost any place or with onboard equipment. It may take advantage of other renewable sources such as wind, solar power or river, tidal, wave hydropower to move an air compressor, hydraulic pump or Stirling engine.

The structural weight of composite pressure vessels is low relative to lithium-ion batteries and also to steel tanks (70% lighter), which can be reduced by using the tanks as vehicle chassis structures with appropriate impact isolation. The wheel hub motor rotary engines are also light weight.

They have energy synergy with the available pneumatic energy, so all vehicle mechatronics systems can be powered by small air motors, and the vehicle can also use active pneumatic suspension, pneumatic steering or pneumatic shock absorption bumpers, and provide air conditioning or climate control using the low temperature created during air expansion. Energy recovery systems with regenerative suspension and regenerative braking produce low pressure compressed air to be stored in an additional pressure vessel.

There is little noise from pistonless rotary engines while using compressed air, which can also being soundproofed because the low temperature in which it works.

There is no fire hazard, which makes it one of the few transportation systems that cannot produce spontaneous or after-collision fire or explosions as with petrol, ethanol, hydrogen and also battery vehicles.

== Disadvantages ==

The energy density of compressed air is low compared to liquid nitrogen or hydrogen, and the energy efficiency of compressed air engine compared to micro gas turbine with adequate soundproofing that can be used in hybrid gas turbine-electric motor vehicles with a mixture of compressed air, liquid nitrogen or hydrogen (previous gas turbine vehicles have used a setup for speed, rather than efficiency consisting in a large noise gas turbines connected to the transmission) since the gas turbine (which are used in thermal power plants due to its efficiency) outperforms pistonless rotary engines, however the production of compressed air is more energy efficient and so requires less wind power and infrastructure and also there is a loss of efficiency from gas turbine to generator and to electric motor.

While batteries can somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge and chemical fuel tanks provide the same power densities from the first to the last litre, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as air is drawn off, reducing available power.

== Possible improvements ==

It may be possible to store compressed air at lower pressure using an absorption material within the tank. Absorption materials like Activated carbon, or a metal organic framework is used for storing compressed natural gas at instead of , which amounts to a large energy saving.

== Vehicles ==

=== Production cars ===

Several companies are investigating and producing prototypes including hybrid compressed-air/gasoline-combustion vehicles. As of August 2017, none of the developers have yet gone into production, although Tata has indicated they will begin selling vehicles from 2020 and MDI&#x27;s US distributor Zero Pollution Motors says production of the AIRPod will commence in Europe in 2018.

=== Experimental cars and bikes ===
In 2008, a compressed air and natural gas powered vehicle designed by engineering students at Deakin University in Australia was the joint winner of the Ford Motor Company T2 competition to produce a car with a range and an estimated cost of less than $7,000.

Australian company Engineair has produced several vehicle types - moped, small car, small carrier, go-cart - around the rotary compressed air engine created by Angelo Di Pietro.

A compressed-air powered motorcycle, called the Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle was made by Edwin Yi Yuan, based on the Suzuki GP100 and using the Angelo Di Pietro compressed-air engine.

Three mechanical engineering students from San Jose State University; Daniel Mekis, Dennis Schaaf and Andrew Merovich, designed and built a bike that runs on compressed air. The total cost of the prototype was under $1000 and was sponsored by Sunshops (on the Boardwalk in Santa Cruz, California) and NO DIG NO RIDE (from Aptos, California.). The top speed of the maiden voyage in May 2009 was .
While their design was simple, these three pioneers of compressed air powered vehicles helped pave the way for French automaker Peugeot Citroën to invent a brand new air-powered hybrid. The &#x27;Hybrid Air&#x27; system uses compressed air to move the car&#x27;s wheels when driving under . Peugeot said the new hybrid system should get up to 141 miles per gallon of gas. Models were claimed to start rolling out as early as 2016 . However, the head of the project left Peugeot in 2014, and in 2015 the company said it had been unable to find a partner to share the development costs, effectively ending the project.

&quot;Ku:Rin&quot; named air-compressed three-wheeler vehicle was created by Toyota in 2011. The specialty of this vehicle is it has registered a record-breaking highest speed of even if it has an engine that uses only compressed air. This car was developed by the company&#x27;s &quot;Dream car workshop&quot;. This car is nicknamed as &quot;sleek rocket&quot;, or &quot;pencil shaped rocket&quot;.

As part of the TV-show Planet Mechanics, Jem Stansfield and Dick Strawbridge converted a regular scooter to a compressed air moped. This has been done by equipping the scooter with a compressed-air engine and air tank.

In 2010, Honda presented the Honda Air concept car at the LA Auto Show.

Since 2008 the former Bosch Rexroth, now Emerson is organizing the Emerson&#x27;s International AVENTICS Pneumobile Competition in Eger, Hungary. It is a competition for students in the higher education to build racing vehicles propelled by compressed air.

There is an international conference related to the event organized by Óbuda University, Department of Bánki Donát Mechanical and Safety Engineering.

=== Trains, Trams, Boats and Planes ===

Compressed-air locomotives are a kind of fireless locomotive and have been used in mining and tunnel boring.

Various compressed-air-powered trams were trialled, starting in 1876. In Nantes and Paris Mekarski system trams ran in regular service for over 30 years. See also Nantes tramway#Compressed-air trams (1879–1917).

Currently, no water or air vehicles exist that make use of the compressed-air engine. Historically certain torpedoes were propelled by compressed-air engines.

<text>Mitch All Together is the second comedy album by Mitch Hedberg, and the final released in his lifetime. It is a recording of a performance at the Acme Comedy Club in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from May 2003. The CD was packaged with a DVD of Hedberg&#x27;s 1999 Comedy Central special in two versions, the first being the one edited down to a half-hour and shown on Comedy Central, and the second being the raw unedited taping which is about 15 minutes longer. The DVD also features his appearance on a 1998 episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Premium Blend&quot;. The CD is packaged in a double-fold digipack.

As with his previous album, the title &quot;Mitch All Together&quot; is a reference to a joke which is not included on the album (the joke is on track seven of the 1999 self-released edition of his previous album &quot;Strategic Grill Locations&quot;):

<doc id="773682" wikidata="Q3010939" url="?curid=773682" title="Salmon Arm">
<text>Salmon Arm is a city in the Columbia Shuswap Regional District of the Southern Interior of the Canadian province of British Columbia that has a population of 17,706 (2016). Salmon Arm was incorporated as a municipal district on May 15, 2005. The city of Salmon Arm separated from the district in 1912, but was downgraded to a village in 1958. In 1970, the city of Salmon Arm once again reunited with the District Municipality. Salmon Arm once again became a city in 2005, and is now the location of the head offices of the Columbia-Shuswap Regional District. It is a tourist town in the summer, with many beaches, camping facilities and house boat rentals. Salmon Arm is home to the longest wooden freshwater wharf in North America.

== Etymology ==
Salmon Arm takes its name from its place along Shuswap Lake. The lake has four &quot;arms&quot;: Shuswap Arm in the west, Seymour Arm in the north, Anstey Arm in the northeast, and Salmon Arm in the south, named after the large runs of salmon that used to run up the creeks that empty into the lake. The city of Salmon Arm takes its name from its location along the Salmon Arm of Shuswap Lake.

==History==
Much has been written about the history of Salmon Arm following the laying of the Canadian Pacific Railway in September 1885. While miners and settlers looked for gold in the surrounding areas, the beaches of Salmon Arm lay virtually untouched. By the end of the 1890s, the town had grown to include many new buildings such as two general stores, a school, and a hotel. The population had also grown to include over 200 citizens.

By 1904, Salmon Arm had acquired a reputation for having an excellent fruit harvest. The local businessmen grew fruit as a main export, sending it to the larger, more populated towns that surrounded it.

In May 1905, a formal local government was started by the request of its citizens. Later on, in 1912, Salmon Arm upgraded its town status to an official city.

In 1951, Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Salmon Arm while on a royal tour of Canada.

On August 8, 1982, while Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his sons passed through Salmon Arm, they were confronted by three demonstrators protesting &quot;high unemployment and the way the Prime Minister was handling the economy.&quot; Trudeau infamously gave the protesters the finger; his gesture was caught on a single television camera and immediately used by some as, &quot;a vivid symbol for those who thought the Liberal prime minister arrogant and hostile to Western Canada.&quot; However, to many Trudeau&#x27;s response was seen as a commemorated joke. Only a month after the incident T-shirts, which depicted a caricature of Trudeau leaning out of a train with his middle finger raised, were being produced and sold to the citizens of Salmon Arm.

In 1998, an area of 13,500 acres (34 km2 or just over 5000 hectares) immediately southwest of Salmon Arm was burnt to the extent of deforestation by a wildfire started by lightning. An emergency evacuation was executed as the fire got closer. Remarkably, just as the fire reached the valley floor, a sudden change of wind direction forced the fire back on itself, extinguishing it. The fire came so close that trees in many backyards were singed and barn paint was peeled. The media reported &quot;20 homes and 15 barns&quot; were destroyed during the firestorm in the Silver Creek area to the south of Salmon Arm, which also produced Canada&#x27;s largest civil evacuation up to that date when the &quot;5,000-hectare forest fire that forced the removal of 7,000 residents of Salmon Arm was being blown toward the town.&quot;

==Geography==
Salmon Arm is on the shores of Shuswap Lake, where the Salmon River empties into the Salmon Arm reach of the Lake. Directly south of the city lies Mount Ida, to the west Fly Hills, and across Shuswap Lake lies Bastion Mountain.

Mike Worobey is winner of the Nora and Ted Sterling Prize in Support of Controversy for 2009 from Simon Fraser University and is known for research on COVID-19 pandemic beginnings.

== Culture ==
The summer months are when the city experiences its largest fluctuation of population with people on holidays coming to visit the city and surrounding area. During every third weekend of August, the annual Salmon Arm Roots and Blues festival draws large crowds of festival-goers with an international roster of performers. The Festival emerged from the Shuswap Coffee House movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which by 1991 had coalesced into the non-profit Salmon Arm Folk Music Society, the Festival&#x27;s founding body. From its grassroots beginnings, Roots &amp; Blues has grown into the largest and most musically diverse festival in the British Columbian interior. After two years of virtual festival pre-recorded performances (2020 &amp; 2021), the Festival resumes an in-person event for its 30th anniversary in 2022. There is also the annual Word on the Lake Writers’ Festival organized by the Shuswap Association of Writers (SAW). For 17 years it was held at the Prestige Inn in Salmon Arm, though its 2022 venue will be located in Sorrento.

Salmon Arm is home to a multiplex movie theatre (Salmar Grand) and a single screen theatre for movies and live stage performances (Salmar Classic); both are owned and operated by a non-profit community organization, the Salmar Community Association. Additionally, a community theatre society hosts plays and other live stage performances (Shuswap Theatre) in a building across the street from the Salmar Grand multiplex.

The RJ Haney Heritage Park &amp; Museum is Salmon Arm&#x27;s main museum, and celebrates the history of the region. The museum often offers a dinner theatre program during the summer months, with the theatre component offering plays based on local history.

Salmon Arm is home to a branch of Okanagan Regional Library (ORL), which is currently located in Piccadilly Mall.

The Salmon Arm public art gallery is the Salmon Arm Art Gallery, housed in a historic building owned by the city and operated by Shuswap District Arts Council. The building was originally a post office, and later housed the Salmon Arm branch of Okanagan Regional Library for many years.

===Sports and recreation===
Large crowds of tourists and locals are drawn to the beaches at Sunnybrae, Canoe, and elsewhere on Shuswap Lake during the summer. The city has many large hotels, as well as berths for a number of houseboats.

The community offers a number of recreational facilities and sports leagues. There are fields for soccer/rugby/football, fields for baseball/softball, as well as a 6 sheet curling rink (SACC), five-pin bowling lanes (lakeside lanes bowling center), several golf courses and many seasonal recreational businesses. The proximity of the Shuswap Lake has also resulted in a growing interest in rowing and paddling sports, particularly dragon boat racing.

The Salmon Arm Silverbacks hockey team, in the BCHL, plays at Roger’s Rink (formerly the Sunwave Centre). The publicly owned twin ice rink facility is named in relation to the facility&#x27;s community sponsor, Shaw Cable (which purchased the local, independent cable service provider SunCountry Cablevision in June 2011; SunCountry had branded its highspeed cable Internet service as Sunwave.net, and had sponsored the ice rink facility under the name Sunwave Centre). Co-located in the same area with the Shaw Centre are the city&#x27;s recreation centre (with pool, racquet courts, weight facility and auditorium/gymnasium), curling rink, lawn bowling facility, horseshoe pitch, and the Salmon Arm campus of Okanagan College. The city&#x27;s previous indoor ice arena, Memorial Arena, has been repurposed as an indoor field sports facility, and is heavily used by such sports as soccer, rugby, and archery. Memorial Arena, with sponsorship from the Salmon Arm Savings &amp; Credit Union has been rebranded as the SASCU Memorial Recreation Centre, while the main recreation centre is similarly sponsored and branded the SASCU Recreation Centre.

Former NHL player Dave Scatchard was raised in Salmon Arm, playing his minor hockey there. Other notable athletes raised in or with ties to Salmon Arm are swimmer Rick Say and curler Sandra Jenkins.

==Transportation==
Salmon Arm lies on the Trans-Canada Highway approximately halfway between Vancouver and Calgary. It is also at the top of Highway 97B, which leads to Vernon and Kelowna. The economy benefits from through traffic; many brand-name hotels and restaurants have opened in the past few decades.

The Canadian Pacific Kansas City also runs through Salmon Arm. No passenger service is available, though the Rocky Mountaineer trains pass through on occasion despite not stopping.

Salmon Arm Airport mainly serves general aviation aircraft, though scheduled service to Vancouver and Calgary was available by Northern Hawk Aviation until it ceased operations.

Salmon Arm has a bus network that serves neighbourhoods and shopping destinations using commuter minibuses on hourly schedules. It also offers handyDart service for the disabled and scheduled services to communities across the region once per week.

==Damage from 1998 wildfire==
In 1998, an area of 13,500 acres (about 55 km2 or 5500 hectares) immediately southwest of Salmon Arm was burnt to the extent of deforestation by a wildfire started by lightning. The fire came down from the Fly Hills in the west and embers carried by the wind jumped the valley and ignited Mount Ida. Flames raced down both sides of the valley, threatening many homes. An emergency evacuation was executed as the fire hotfooted it closer. Remarkably, just as the fire reached the valley floor, a sudden change of wind direction forced the fire back on itself, extinguishing it. The fire came so close that trees in many backyards were singed and barn paint was peeled.

The media reported &quot;20 homes and 15 barns&quot; were destroyed during the firestorm in the Silver Creek area to the south of Salmon Arm, which also produced Canada&#x27;s largest civil evacuation up to that date when the &quot;5,000-hectare forest fire that forced the removal of 7,000 residents of Salmon Arm was being blown toward the town.&quot;

==Sister city==
* Salmon Arm&#x27;s sister city is Inashiki, Ibaraki, Japan (Formerly Azuma, Ibaraki, Japan, until its recent amalgamation into Inashiki). There is a pavilion near McGuire Lake in honour of the friendship between Japan and Salmon Arm.

<doc id="773683" wikidata="Q3499223" url="?curid=773683" title="Steven Fletcher (politician)">
<text>Steven John Fletcher (born 17 June 1972) is a former Canadian politician. He served in senior roles in the Conservative Party of Canada in opposition and in government, including 5 years as a Federal Cabinet Minister. After four terms as a Member of Parliament, he served a term as a member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly for one term.

Fletcher served in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to 2015, representing the riding of Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia as a member of the Conservative Party. In 2004, the then leader of the opposition Stephen Harper appointed Fletcher to the shadow cabinet as health critic. After forming government, Fletcher was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to Health in 2006. He was appointed to cabinet in 2008. He served on numerous cabinet committees. He was the Minister for Democratic Reform and then after the 2011 election, was appointed to Minister of State (Transport). He was the first quadriplegic and wheelchair user to serve in the House of Commons, as well as in Cabinet. Fletcher was appointed as Minister of State (Democratic Reform) on 30 October 2008. After the Conservative Party victory on 2 May 2011, Fletcher was appointed as Minister of State (Transport).

Fletcher received the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal on 17 December 2002, for his contributions to society and advocacy work. He received the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

Fletcher was the leader of the Manitoba Party and an MLA in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly.

In an effort to increase the number of women in cabinet, Fletcher was left out of cabinet in the 15 July 2013 Cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Although not officially in Cabinet, he continued to sit on the treasury board cabinet committee. Fletcher was defeated in the federal election of 2015, but was elected six months later to the riding of Assiniboia in Manitoba&#x27;s 2016 provincial election.

Fletcher resigned his membership in the Federal Conservative party in October 2018, and his party membership in the Provincial Progressive Conservative Party in June of the same year, exactly one year after leaving the Provincial Caucus.

==Early life and accident==
Fletcher was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his Canadian father was working as an engineer. He was raised in Manitoba, and attended Shaftesbury High School in Winnipeg. Fletcher received a degree in Geological Engineering from the University of Manitoba in 1995.

He became a complete quadriplegic on 11 January 1996, after hitting a moose with his vehicle while travelling to a geological engineering job in northern Manitoba. The accident left him completely paralysed below the neck, and he now requires 24-hour-a-day attendant care. He was unable to speak for several months, and only regained this ability after a long process of recovery.

In the immediate aftermath of his accident, Fletcher was told that he would have to spend the rest of his life in an institution. Years later, he joked: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the doctors ever thought the institution would be Parliament.&quot; When asked about his disability during his first campaign for public office, he quipped: &quot;I would rather be paralyzed from the neck down than from the neck up.&quot;

Before his accident, Fletcher was a wilderness canoe enthusiast. He served as president of the Manitoba Recreational Canoeing Association, was a two-time former Manitoba Kayak Champion, and competed in national events. He was able to resume his life as an outdoorsman in the mid-2000s through inventions such as the TrailRider, a device which allows quadriplegics to travel over rough terrain. In late 2004, he was able to stand again with the assistance of an hydraulic wheelchair. He recently competed in water races, and has won awards using &quot;sip and puff&quot; steering technology. In 2006, he visited the Burgess Shale in the Rocky Mountains with the help of a TrailRider and other hikers.

Fletcher has said that the accident changed his political views. He acknowledges that he &quot;didn&#x27;t give the less-fortunate any consideration&quot; before 1996, but now describes himself as a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot;. More recently, he has expressed his views on the conditions under which Medical aid in dying should be allowed.

== Students&#x27; union president ==
Fletcher returned to the University of Manitoba in 1997 to take a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program. He was elected president of the University of Manitoba Students&#x27; Union (UMSU) in February 1999, and identified his main priorities as improving the university&#x27;s public profile and increasing access for students in financial need. He also called for greater university access for disabled students and for higher aboriginal enrollment. In October 1999, he met with federal Finance Minister Paul Martin to lobby for increased student funding.

Fletcher&#x27;s political views often put him at odds with other campus organizations during much of his tenure, and he was sometimes accused of administrative bias against left-wing groups. In early 2000, he supported a decision by student council to freeze university funding for &quot;The Manitoban&quot;, a campus newspaper with a left-leaning editorial board. He argued that the issue at stake was one of financial accountability, although his opponents suggested he was trying to infringe on the paper&#x27;s autonomy. Funding was restored when the newspaper staff agreed to accept an Ombudsman Board.

Fletcher was elected as a director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations during his first term. He was re-elected student body president in 2000, and presided over the elimination of the UMSU&#x27;s debt in May 2000. He credited a partnership with Starbucks for much of the council&#x27;s $43,000 surplus.

In late 2000, Fletcher announced that he would seek the Progressive Conservative nomination for a provincial by-election in Tuxedo. Some of his opponents later tried to remove him as student president, arguing that such partisan activity was inappropriate for someone elected to represent the interests of all students. Fletcher argued that the university&#x27;s constitution did not prevent him from participating in provincial politics, and described his opponents as &quot;far left extremists&quot;. He lost the provincial nomination to Heather Stefanson. His opponents in the Graduate Students Association later voted to separate from the UMSU, although the University of Manitoba refused to sanction the separation.

Near the end of 2000, Fletcher endorsed a report from the right-wing Fraser Institute which suggested that Canada would have to end university union contracts and professorial tenure to retain bright young academics. He was quoted as saying: &quot;There is merit. You&#x27;d have to break the union, I would guess.&quot;

During the 2001 student election campaign, Fletcher, with the assistance of Colleen Bready, then UMSU vice-president, and a Security Services officer, performed an unannounced search of several student group offices. The affected groups included the Graduate Students&#x27; Association, the Womyn&#x27;s Centre, Amnesty International, the U of M Recycling Group (UMREG), the Rainbow Pride Mosaic, and the &quot;Manitoban&quot;. Fletcher and Bready said they had been &quot;made aware of a suspicion&quot; that campaign materials were being stored in the student group offices in violation of UMSU election bylaws. The search was condemned by other campus groups, with UMREG coordinator Rob Altemeyer describing Fletcher&#x27;s actions as &quot;completely inappropriate&quot;. Fletcher defended his actions, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s UMSU space. We have the authority and the right to check [student organization] space at any time.&quot; Bready said they felt warranted since a slate of candidates had already been found guilty earlier in the week of using the Graduate Students&#x27; Association office for campaign activities.

In March 2001, Fletcher called for a central co-ordination body to oversee Manitoba&#x27;s universities, arguing that the province &quot;is too small to have five universities offering the same thing&quot;. He opposed the provincial government&#x27;s 2001 decision to build a new university in northern Manitoba. Fletcher finished his second and final term as student president in May 2001, and received his MBA in 2002.

==Political career==

===Party president===

Fletcher was elected president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in November 2001, and was re-elected in 2003. His relationship with party leader Stuart Murray was sometimes fractious. Fletcher criticized Murray in 2002 for hiring discredited advisor Taras Sokolyk without informing him, and suggested that Murray had not taken sufficient action to improve the state of the party&#x27;s finances.

After Fletcher&#x27;s election as party president, Manitoba Public Insurance announced that it would no longer provide travel expenses for his personal assistant. A representative for MPI argued that attending party functions was not a prerequisite for Fletcher&#x27;s stated career goal of becoming an elected politician, and indicated that the fund was not legally required to pay for these activities. Fletcher appealed this decision before the Manitoba Court of Appeal, hiring former New Democratic Party cabinet minister Sidney Green as his attorney. In May 2003, the Court of Appeal ruled that MPI has the discretion to fund such activities under Section 138 of the MPI Act, but is not obliged to use this discretion. He later tried to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the court twice declined to hear his case. Fletcher filed a lawsuit against former provincial cabinet minister Becky Barrett in September 2003, arguing that she had &quot;maliciously&quot; interfered in his legal battles.

===Federal politician===

In late 2003, Fletcher defeated Don Murdock to win the Canadian Alliance nomination in Charleswood—St. James for the 2004 federal election. He later supported the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the more centrist Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and endorsed Stephen Harper&#x27;s bid to lead the merged Conservative Party of Canada in early 2004. Fletcher&#x27;s Alliance nomination was rendered void by the merger, and he was required to contest another nomination for the new party. He defeated Murdock a second time, and was declared the riding&#x27;s Conservative Party candidate in March 2004.

Fletcher defeated star Liberal candidate Glen Murray, a popular former Mayor of Winnipeg, by 734 votes in the 2004 election. His victory was considered an upset, although polls before election day indicated the result would be close. The Liberal Party won a minority government nationally, and Fletcher was named as Senior Health Critic in the Official Opposition.

Fletcher is the first Member of Parliament (MP) in Canadian history with a permanent disability. A running joke during his first campaign was that he would have to be a front bench MP, as the backbenches are not wheelchair-accessible. His election created the need for a &quot;stranger to the House&quot;—a person who is not officially an MP or officer of Parliament—in this case, his aide, to actually be on the floor of the Commons during sessions.

The Parliament buildings had to be adapted to accommodate Fletcher. In Ottawa, Fletcher has advocated for community living, the integration of physically or mentally disabled individuals into society. He has said, &quot;Community living is better for the individual for sure, better for their families, and in most cases—not all—it&#x27;s better on the taxpayer too.&quot;

===Opposition MP===

As Conservative Health Critic, Fletcher described himself as a supporter of the Canada Health Act but also indicated a willingness to permit greater private-sector involvement. He suggested that the government is &quot;notorious for stifling innovation&quot;, and argued that the private sector should not be &quot;pigeonholed like doctors who tried to pigeonhole me&quot;. Liberal Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh responded by arguing that the Conservative position would jeopardize the principles of the Canada Health Act.

On 20 April 2005, the House of Commons supported Fletcher&#x27;s Motion to compensate all Canadians who were infected with Hepatitis C by the Canadian Red Cross as a result of its failure to test blood samples. This was a major development in a decade-long struggle to have the pre-1986 and post-1990 Hepatitis C victims included in a federal compensation package. A compensation funding package was announced in 2006.

The following month, Fletcher became involved in a controversy unrelated to his parliamentary duties. On 21 May 2005, he apologized for saying &quot;The Japs were bastards&quot; at a veterans&#x27; convention in Winnipeg the previous week, in reference to Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. He defended the general intent of his remarks, noting that his grandfather had witnessed the Japanese army commit atrocities when he was taken as a prisoner of war after that fall of Singapore. He also acknowledged that he used &quot;language that was inappropriate&quot;.

In November 2005, Fletcher and New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin endorsed a motion to minimize trans-fats in the Canadian food supply. A task force to investigate the issue of trans-fats was subsequently struck, and provided recommendations to the government in 2007.

===Government MP===

Fletcher was re-elected with an increased majority in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives won a minority government nationally. After the election, he was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health and the minister for the Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario.

Fletcher supported Sam Katz&#x27;s bid for re-election as Mayor of Winnipeg in 2006. In late 2006, he assisted Liberal MP Andy Scott in presenting a motion for a national strategy on the treatment of persons with autism. He received a 2006 Champion of Mental Health Award.

Fletcher has received awards for community involvement, including a special award from the National Cancer Leadership Forum for advocating a national cancer strategy. He has also received the Courage and Leadership Award from the Canadian Cancer Society, and was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame on 13 November 2006. Fletcher was also awarded the King Clancy Award, as well as being a recipient of her Majesty&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal for his contributions to Canada.

Fletcher has advocated for embryonic stem cell research using embryos that would otherwise be discarded from in-vitro fertilization techniques. He stated on CBC&#x27;s The National &quot; I would ask this question. A Canadian who finds themselves with a terrible ailment or a loved one with a terrible ailment and there is a cure that is derived by embryonic stem cell research, would they deny their loved one or themselves that cure because of the source of the cure? Most Canadians would say please, cure me.&quot;

In March 2007, Fletcher began a campaign to have Ottawa&#x27;s taxi service improve its wheelchair accessibility. There is a book written by Linda McIntosh, a former Member of the Legislative Assembly in Manitoba, about Fletcher&#x27;s life entitled &quot;What Do You Do If You Don&#x27;t Die?&quot; released in December 2008.

===Minister of State (Democratic Reform)===

After being elected for a third time in the 2008 federal election, Fletcher was appointed as Minister of State for Democratic Reform on 30 October 2008. Fletcher is the first person in history with a permanent disability to be named to the Canadian cabinet. At the time of his appointment, he was quoted saying &quot;I would pinch myself if I could.&quot;

Fletcher is only the third federal conservative cabinet minister from a Winnipeg riding. The previous two were Gordon Churchill during the 1950s and the son of Canada&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Hugh John Macdonald, who served as a cabinet minister in the late 19th century.

On 4 March 2010, Fletcher received the Christopher Reeve Award from the Canadian Paraplegic Association. Teren Clarke, executive director of the Canadian Paraplegic Association said when
the announcement was made. &quot;Steven Fletcher&#x27;s journey is an inspiration to all of us since sustaining a high level spinal cord injury only a few years ago. And now as a member of the Federal Cabinet, he deals with matters well beyond the scope of disability issues, and that deserves our recognition with this national/international award.&quot;

===Minister of State (Transport)===
Fletcher was re-elected in the 2011 General Election, after capturing 58 percent of votes. As Minister of State for Transport, Fletcher&#x27;s new responsibilities fall within the larger portfolio of the Honourable Denis Lebel, Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. In addition to continuing to serve on Treasury Board, Minister Fletcher also serves on the Cabinet Committee on Economic Prosperity and Sustainable Growth. &quot;When it comes to Canada&#x27;s transportation systems, our Government is committed to protecting the safety and security of Canadians&quot;, said Fletcher.

As Minister of State, Fletcher is responsible for the Crown Corporations the fall within the Transport portfolio. These include but are not limited to; Canada Post, VIA Rail, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), Ridley Coal Terminals, and half a dozen federally owned bridges. Fletcher also conducted National Round Tables on Infrastructure in the year 2012 to help develop a National Infrastructure Program. In budget 2013 a 70 Billion dollar investment over 10 years into infrastructure was announced by the Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty.

On 16 January 2012, Fletcher announced that he was temporarily stepping down from his position as Minister of State for Transport for an unspecified medical procedure.

Fletcher underwent a 12-hour surgery on 19 January 2012. The doctors removed an old titanium rod and replaced it with a much longer rod, this time secured to the back of his neck, not the front. It stretches from the middle of Fletcher&#x27;s head to the middle of his back. &quot;If our civilization lasts 1,000 years, my neck will last 1,000 years. It feels better than I can remember&quot;, Fletcher said.

On 26 March 2012, Fletcher returned to office and resumed full activities as Minister of State (Transport) and Member of Parliament for Charleswood – St. James – Assiniboia – Headingley.

On 15 July 2013, Fletcher was moved from Cabinet by Prime Minister Stephen Harper in order to make way for more women in a wide-ranging cabinet shuffle that saw several members of the Cabinet replaced. Fletcher stated on Twitter &quot;I am Conservative. I am a traditionalist. I wish I had left Cabinet in the traditional way--- with a sex scandal.&quot; Prime Minister Harper kept Fletcher on Treasury Board after the Cabinet Shuffle. Fletcher was the longest serving member on the board.

In March 2014, Fletcher introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to make physician-assisted death legal under Canadian laws. When the Supreme Court struck down the law prohibiting assisted suicide in February 2015, Fletcher spoke out in support of the court&#x27;s ruling. The Supreme Court used a substantial portion of Fletchers private members bill word for word in their decision

During the 2015 election a book titled &quot;Master of My Own Fate&quot; was released, written by Linda McIntosh and Steven Fletcher. The book chronicles the seven years after the end of the first biography &quot;What Do You Do If You Don&#x27;t Die?&quot; by Linda McIntosh. The book describes events leading up to Fletcher introducing his two private member bills on physician assisted death. It also provides anecdotes on people and events on Parliament Hill including the October 2014 shooting at Parliament Hill and well known Conservatives who are now deceased including former finance minister Jim Flaherty and former senator Doug Finley. The views of other former and current parliamentarians on this issue include Senator Nancy Ruth, Senator Larry Campbell, MP Peter Kent, former MP Svend Robinson and Green Party leader Elizabeth May.

Fletcher was defeated in the 2015 federal election by Liberal Doug Eyolfson as the Conservatives lost all of their seats in Winnipeg.

===Provincial MLA===
Six months after his defeat, Fletcher moved to provincial politics when he was elected in the 2016 Manitoba general election as the Progressive Conservative MLA for Assiniboia, which covers much of his former federal riding.

Fletcher was later removed from the PC caucus on 30 June 2017, and would sit as an independent, after publicly breaking with the party on multiple issues, specifically the creation of a new Crown Corporation and the Manitoba government&#x27;s attempt to introduce a Manitoba only carbon tax. 

On 13 August 2018, Fletcher joined the Manitoba Party. He became leader of the Manitoba Party on 11 September 2018.

According to the Winnipeg free press, three reasons lead to Fletchers removal from the PC Manitoba caucus. They are; His introduction of private members legislations, opposing a government bill to create a crown corporation for energy efficiency, and a presentation he gave at a town hall hosted by Manitoba Forward.[75] [76] [77]

Fletcher argued that the PC party did not run on creating a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond what the government had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation at the cost of billions of dollars, with no acceptor to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the demand side management of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine with the facts that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro fiscal position to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro has no choice but to raise rates. This in itself with reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.

Fletcher has introduced many pieces of legislation as an Independent member, or as leader of the new Manitoba party.

===List of Legislation introduced by Fletcher as an MLA===

Indigenous Representation Act . This landmark legislation provides a template on how to increase Indigenous representation in the Manitoba Legislature. The legislation is designed to be constitutional within the gift of the Manitoba legislative assembly, and is inspired by current practices in New Zealand.

The Gift of Life Act . This legislations is designed to increase organ donations, it changes the paradigm to assume that everyone is an organ donor for transplant purposes, unless they state otherwise.

The Conflict of Interest Amendment Act. This legislations purpose is to update the current legislation which Fletcher describes as &quot;woefully inadequate&quot;.

The Electoral Divisions Amendment Act. This legislation would reduce the number of seats in the Manitoba legislature by 8. The current number of sitting MLA&#x27;s are 57, Fletchers bill would reduce is to 49 by the next election. Fletcher argues that we are over governed in Manitoba, there would be significant cost savings and increase the competition to be an MLA.

The Manitoba Public Insurance Act. This bill would remove artificial caps that penalize youth, and the catastrophically injured given Manitoba&#x27;s no fault system for automobile collisions.

Brookside Cemetery Recognition Act. This legislation will recognize one of the largest Commonwealth cemetery&#x27;s in the world, and Winnipeg&#x27;s oldest cemetery&#x27;s. Many historic figures have been laid to rest here.

The Legal Profession Amendment Act (Queen&#x27;s Counsel Appointments). This legislation recognizes lawyers who have served society with distinction, it will bring Manitoba inline with other provinces.

Fletcher also announced that he would be launching a constitutional court challenge against the legislation introduced by the previous government affecting parliamentary privilege.

Fletcher has also challenged the Manitoba legislature to become more accessible to Manitobans, in particular the legislative buildings needed to be updated to meet modern wheelchair accessible laws.

===Return to federal politics===
On 22 May 2019, Fletcher announced he would run again for his former seat in Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia—Headingley for the party of another former Conservative minister Maxime Bernier with the People&#x27;s Party of Canada. Fletcher claimed that he and Bernier are &quot;ideological soulmates.&quot;

<doc id="773685" wikidata="Q3363772" url="?curid=773685" title="Formalism (art)">
<text>In art history, formalism is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and style. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual or material aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes compositional elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than content, meaning, or the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context of the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be external to the artistic medium itself, and therefore of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to Immanuel Kant and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: &quot;Every form of the objects of sense is either &quot;figure&quot; (&quot;Gestalt&quot;) or &quot;play&quot; (&quot;Spiel&quot;). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (&quot;Reiz&quot;) of colors... may be added, but the delineations (&quot;Zeichnung&quot;) in the... composition (&quot;Komposition&quot;)... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste.&quot; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant&#x27;s position stating: &quot;Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist.&quot;

==Contemporary definition==
Nick Zangwill has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties &quot;that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times.&quot; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic (philosopher) has defined formalism in art and architecture as &quot;the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties.&quot;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies &quot;extreme formalists&quot; who think &quot;that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties,&quot; then he defines &quot;anti-formalist&quot; thinkers as those who &quot;think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties.&quot; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of &quot;moderate formalism&quot;, where its principal exponents defend the principle &quot;that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored.&quot;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled &quot;Deep Formalism&quot;, which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: &quot;a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol.&quot; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or predetermined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in art history and criticism for analyzing works of art: &quot;In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use &#x27;formal analysis&#x27;. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively&quot;.

<text>Francis Stanley &quot;Gabby&quot; Gabreski (born Franciszek Stanisław Gabryszewski; January 28, 1919 – January 31, 2002) was a Polish-American career pilot in the United States Air Force who retired as a colonel after 26 years of military service. He was the top American and United States Army Air Forces fighter ace over Europe during World War II and a jet fighter ace with the Air Force in the Korean War.

Although best known for his credited destruction of 34½ aircraft in aerial combat and being one of only seven U.S. combat pilots to become an ace in two wars, Gabreski was also one of the Air Force&#x27;s most accomplished leaders. In addition to commanding two fighter squadrons, he had six command tours at group or wing level, including one in combat in Korea, totaling over 11 years of command and 15 overall in operational fighter assignments.

After his Air Force career, Gabreski headed the Long Island Rail Road, a commuter railroad owned by the State of New York, and struggled in his attempts to improve its service and financial condition. After two and a half years, he resigned under pressure and went into full retirement.
==Early years==
Gabreski&#x27;s official Air Force biography states:
During his first year at Notre Dame, Gabreski developed an interest in flying. He took lessons in a Taylor Cub and accumulated six hours of flight time. However, his autobiography indicates, he struggled to fly smoothly and did not fly solo, having been advised by his instructor Homer Stockert that he did not &quot;have the touch to be a pilot&quot;.

==World War II==
===U.S. Army Air Forces===
At the start of his second year at Notre Dame, Gabreski enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, volunteering as an aviation cadet. After his induction into the U.S. Army at Pittsburgh, he undertook primary flight training at Parks Air College, near East St. Louis, Illinois, flying the Stearman PT-17. Gabreski was a mediocre trainee and was forced to pass an elimination check ride during primary to continue training.

He advanced to basic flight training at Gunter Army Air Base, Alabama, in the Vultee BT-13 and completed advanced training at Maxwell Field, Alabama, in the North American AT-6 Texan. Gabreski earned his wings and his commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Corps in March 1941, then sailed for Hawaii aboard the to his first assignment.

Assigned as a fighter pilot with the 45th Pursuit Squadron of the 15th Pursuit Group at Wheeler Army Airfield, Hawaii, 2nd Lt. Gabreski trained on both the Curtiss P-36 Hawk and the newer Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. He met his future wife, Catherine &quot;Kay&quot; Cochran, in Hawaii and became engaged shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. During that action, Gabreski joined several members of his squadron in flying P-36 fighters in an attempt to intercept the attackers, but the Japanese had withdrawn. During the spring and summer of 1942, Gabreski remained with the 45th (renamed as 45th Fighter Squadron in May 1942), training in newer model P-40s and in Bell P-39 Airacobras that the unit began to receive.

He closely followed reports on the Battle of Britain and the role played in it by Polish RAF squadrons, especially by the legendary No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron. He became concerned that the US did not have many experienced fighter pilots. This gave him an idea: since Polish squadrons had proved to be capable within the RAF and since he himself was of Polish origin and spoke Polish, he offered to serve as a liaison officer to the Polish squadrons to learn from their experience. The idea was approved, and he left Hawaii for Washington, D.C. in September 1942, where he was promoted to captain.

====RAF duty====
In October, Gabreski reported to the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s VIII Fighter Command in England, at that time a rudimentary new headquarters. After a lengthy period of inactivity, he tried to arrange duty with 303 Squadron, but that unit had been taken out of action for a period of rest. Instead, he was posted to No. 315 (Dęblin) Squadron at RAF Northolt in January 1943.

Gabreski flew the new Supermarine Spitfire Mark IX, flying patrol sweeps over the Channel. He first encountered &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; opposition on February 3, when a group of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s jumped his squadron. Too excited to make a &quot;kill&quot;, Gabreski learned that he had to keep calm during a mission, a lesson that served him well later in the war. He later spoke with great esteem about the Polish pilots and the lessons they taught him. In all, Gabreski flew 20 missions with the Poles, engaging in combat once.

====56th Fighter Group====
On February 27, 1943, Gabreski became part of the 56th Fighter Group, flying the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, assigned to the 61st Fighter Squadron, and quickly became a flight leader. He was immediately resented by many of his fellow pilots, and the fact that he was opinionated and outspoken did little to ease the situation. In May, shortly after the group moved to RAF Halesworth and entered combat, Gabreski was promoted to major.

On June 9, he took command of the 61st Fighter Squadron when its commanding officer was moved up to group deputy commander. This also stirred ill feelings toward him since he had been jumped over two more senior pilots. This ill-will was soon exacerbated when both of these men were lost in combat on June 26 and did not subside until he recorded his first credited kill: an Fw 190 near Dreux, France, on August 24, 1943. His first kill presaged criticism that followed him throughout his combat career, when his wingmen complained that his attack had been too hastily conducted to allow them to also engage.

On November 26, 1943, the 56th FG was assigned to cover the withdrawal of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers that had bombed Bremen, Germany. The P-47s arrived to find the bombers under heavy attack near Oldenburg and dived into the fray. Gabreski recorded his fourth and fifth kills to become an ace, but had a close brush with death on December 11, when a 20 mm (.79 in) cannon shell lodged in his engine without exploding, destroying its turbocharger. Low on fuel and ammunition, Gabreski outmaneuvered a Bf 109 until it succeeded in placing a burst of fire into his P-47, disabling the engine. Gabreski stayed in the airplane, however, until it restarted at a lower altitude, where the turbocharger was not needed.
In November 1943, the group commander of the 56th, Colonel Hubert Zemke, was replaced in command for two months by Colonel Robert Landry, a staff officer at VIII FC. Because of Landry&#x27;s inexperience, combat missions of the 56th were alternately led by deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel David C. Schilling and Gabreski, who acted as deputy group operations officer. When Zemke resumed command on January 19, 1944, Gabreski relinquished command of the 61st FS.

In February 1944, Gabreski brought two Polish pilots into the 56th, who had flown with him in 1943 while serving with the RAF, including future USAAF ace Squadron Leader Boleslaw &quot;Mike&quot; Gladych. With Gabreski&#x27;s support and to ease a shortage of experienced pilots caused by many veterans reaching the completion of their tours, the 61st FS in April accepted five other Polish Air Force pilots into the squadron as the &quot;Polish Flight&quot;.

Gabreski&#x27;s victory total steadily climbed through the winter of 1943–44. By March 27, he had 18 victory credits and had six multiple-kill missions to rank third in the &quot;ace race&quot; that had developed within VIII Fighter Command. He downed only one more aircraft in the next two months, during which time the two pilots ahead of him (Majors Robert S. Johnson and Walker M. Mahurin, also of the 56th FG) were sent home.

In April 1944, the 56th FG moved to RAF Boxted and Gabreski was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He resumed command of the 61st FS when its commander was transferred to VIII FC headquarters.

On May 22, Gabreski shot down three Fw 190s over an airfield in northwest Germany. He tied Johnson as the leading ace in the European Theater of Operations on June 27 (passing Eddie Rickenbacker&#x27;s record from World War I in the process), and on July 5, 1944, became America&#x27;s leading ace in the ETO, with his score of 28 destroyed matching the total at the time of confirmed victories of the Pacific Theatre&#x27;s top American ace, Richard Bong. This total was never surpassed by any U.S. pilot fighting the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

====Prisoner of war====
On July 20, 1944, Gabreski had reached the 300-hour combat time limit for Eighth Air Force fighter pilots and was awaiting an aircraft to return him to the United States on leave and reassignment. He had already advised Kay Cochran to proceed with wedding plans, and his hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania, had raised $2,000 for a wedding present in anticipation of his return.

Gabreski found, however, that a bomber escort mission to Russelheim, Germany, was scheduled for that morning, and, instead of boarding the transport, he requested to &quot;fly just one more.&quot; Returning from the mission, Gabreski observed Heinkel He 111s parked on the airfield at Niedermendig, Germany and took his airplane down to attack.

He was dissatisfied with his first strafing run on an He 111, and he reversed for a second pass. When his tracers went over the parked bomber, he dropped the nose of his Thunderbolt to adjust, and its propeller clipped the runway, bending the tips. The damage caused his engine to vibrate violently and he was forced to crash land. Gabreski then ran into the nearby woods and eluded capture for five days. After being captured, he was interrogated by Obergefreiter Hanns Scharff. He was eventually sent to Stalag Luft I.

Gabreski flew 166 combat sorties and was officially credited by the USAAF with 28 aircraft destroyed in air combat and 3 on the ground. He was assigned five P-47s during his time with the 56th FG, none of which he named, but all of which bore the fuselage identification codes HV: A.

==U.S. Air Force career==
Following his repatriation, Gabreski returned to the United States and married Kay Cochran on June 11, 1945. After a 90-day recuperative leave, he became Chief of Fighter Test Section at Wright Field, Ohio, and at the same time completed test pilot training at its Engineering Flight Test School. In April 1946, he left the service, worked for Douglas Aircraft for a year, then was recalled to active duty in April 1947 to command the 55th Fighter Squadron, 20th Fighter Group, at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina.

His command of the 55th FS was brief. The Air Force sent him to Columbia University in September 1947 to complete his degree and study Russian. In June 1949, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. He returned immediately to flying, becoming commander of his former unit, the 56th Fighter Group, now flying F-80 Shooting Stars at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan. While in command of the 56th, Gabreski oversaw conversion of the unit to North American F-86 Sabres and was promoted to colonel on March 11, 1950.

===Korean War===
He participated in aerial combat again during the Korean War. In June 1951, he and a group of selected pilots of the 56th FIW accompanied the delivery of F-86Es of the 62nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron to South Korea aboard the escort carrier . The planes and pilots joined the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group at K-14 (Kimpo) Air Base, where most engaged in combat. On July 8, 1951, flying his fifth mission in an F-86, Gabreski shot down a MiG-15, followed by MiG kills on September 2 and October 2.

====51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing====
The growing MiG threat against Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber attacks along the Yalu River caused the Fifth Air Force to create a second Sabre wing by converting the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing from F-80s to F-86s in a 10-day period. Gabreski was transferred to K-13 (Suwon) Air Base, accompanied by most of the former 56th FIW pilots who had come with him to Korea, and took command November 6, 1951. During its first seven months as an F-86 wing, the 51st, with only two operational squadrons, scored 96 MiG kills, comparing favorably to the 125 of the veteran 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, which operated three. Gabreski himself scored 3½ more kills to become a jet ace.

He was an aggressive commander and fostered a fierce rivalry between the two F-86 wings, fueled in part by the fact that the 4th had also been the keenest rival of the 56th FG during World War II. While this aggressiveness paid off in the destruction of MiGs and air superiority over all of Korea, it also led Gabreski to make the first intentional violation of rules of engagement that prohibited combat with MiGs over China. (The MiG force was based in this ostensible sanctuary during the entire war.) Gabreski and a fellow former 56th pilot, Colonel Walker M. Mahurin, planned and executed a mission in early 1952 in which the F-86s turned off their IFF equipment and overflew two Chinese bases.

Gabreski was also criticized for having a poor attitude towards wingmen. One historian, citing five interviews with pilots and an unpublished manuscript by a sixth, observed that Gabreski flew the fastest aircraft available and failed to notice when his slower wingmen could not keep up. These pilots, reportedly afraid to fly with him, commented that he was more interested in personal achievement than in his wingmen. He was also criticized for a lack of discipline among his off-duty pilots and for allegedly encouraging exaggerated kill claims.

Nonetheless, at least three wingmen had different views. 1st Lieutenant Joe L. Cannon of the 51st FIW flew over 40 missions with him and described Gabreski as a mentor and &quot;my kind of fighter pilot&quot;. 1st Lt. Harry Shumate, another 51st FIW pilot, stated that while flying wingman in Gabreski&#x27;s flight, Shumate was the first to spot a MiG-15 heading for its base and Gabreski told him to &quot;go get him&quot; while the leader covered. A 4th FIW pilot, 1st Lt. Anthony Kulengosky, observed:
I moved up in the world of wingmen by flying Col. Francis Gabreski&#x27;s wing on a mission. I was absolutely thrilled to fly on this legend&#x27;s wing...He was a tiger and went on to become an ace again. When asked who I looked up to the most as a pilot and a gentleman in all my flying, I still have to say it was &quot;Gabby&quot; Gabreski. When he took over the 51st Wing, he asked me to move over as a flight leader in his outfit.
Capt. Robert W. &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, a 4th FIW pilot in Korea, recalled:
Shortly after my arrival, Gabby flew the first F-86E to arrive on base in simulated combat over the field against an F-86A and whipped the other guy badly, with every Sabre jock on the base as witness. After he landed he briefed all pilots and announced that the limited number of E&#x27;s would be reserved for flight leaders. I never forgot his response, when someone asked about the problem of wingmen staying with leaders. He replied &quot;Wingmen are to absorb firepower&quot; and I never knew him well enough to judge whether he had a dry sense of humor, but he made the right choice. One thing I know for sure, Gabby proved himself the greatest at our skills and talents, when he added 6 ½ MIG kills to his 28 victories in WW II and become the all-time American Fighter Ace, and I MIGht add, he did it in the P-47, not the better air-to-air P-51. And he didn&#x27;t have a chance to fly the much more powerful F-86F, which arrived after us.

A noted pilot also rebuts some of the criticism. Major William T. Whisner had been a P-51 double-ace with the 352nd FG in World War II and was one of the pilots Gabreski brought with him from the 56th FIW in June 1951. Before the mission of February 20, 1952, Gabreski and Whisner each had four MiGs credited as destroyed. During the mission, Gabreski attacked and severely damaged a MiG-15 that fled across the Yalu River into China. He broke off the engagement and returned to base after his own airplane was damaged, where he claimed the MiG as a &quot;probable kill&quot;.

Whisner trailed the MiG deep into Manchuria trying to confirm Gabreski&#x27;s kill, but his Sabre ran low on fuel. He completed the shootdown and returned to K-14 where he confirmed the kill for Gabreski but did not claim it himself. Gabreski confronted him and angrily ordered him to change his mission report, confirming Whisner&#x27;s own role in the kill. Whisner refused. Soon after, Gabreski recanted his anger and the two shared the claim, as a consequence of which three days later Whisner and not Gabreski became the first pilot of the 51st FW to reach jet ace status.

Gabreski&#x27;s Korean tour was due to end in June. As he approached his mission limit in early April, he quit logging sorties to avoid being transferred from his command. He was, however, grounded by Fifth Air Force from further combat in mid-May when his deputy commander, Colonel Mahurin, was shot down. Gabreski was subsequently replaced by Colonel John W. Mitchell, who had led the mission to shoot down Admiral Yamamoto in World War II.

On his return to the United States, Gabreski received the key to the city from San Francisco Mayor Elmer E. Robinson and was given a ticker-tape parade up Market Street on June 17.

Gabreski&#x27;s 6½ MiG-15 kill credits make him one of seven U.S. pilots to become an ace in more than one war (the others being Whisner, Colonel Harrison Thyng, Colonel James P. Hagerstrom, Colonel Vermont Garrison, Major George A. Davis, Jr. and U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John F. Bolt). Gabreski was officially credited with 123 combat missions in Korea, totaling 289 for his career. Although he flew many F-86s in combat, his assigned aircraft was F-86E-10-NA 51-2740, nicknamed &quot;Gabby&quot;.

===Post-Korea===
Gabreski&#x27;s Air Force career continued for another 15 years, during which time he held three wing commands totaling nearly nine years of duty. His assignments were:
*Chief of Combat Operations Section, Office of the Inspector General — Norton Air Force Base, California (July 1952 – June 1954)
*Student, Air War College — Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama (1954–1955)
*Deputy Chief of Staff, Headquarters Ninth Air Force — Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina (July 1955 – August 1956)
*Commander, 342d Fighter-Day Wing — Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina (September 10, 1956 – November 19, 1956) (inactivated before operational and succeeded by 354th TFW)
*Commander, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100 Super Sabre) — Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina (November 19, 1956 – July 13, 1960)
*Commander, 18th Tactical Fighter Wing (F-100) — Kadena Air Base, Okinawa (August 8, 1960 – June 19, 1962)
*Director of the Secretariat, Headquarters Pacific Air Forces — Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii (July 1962 – July 1963)
*Inspector General, Pacific Air Forces — Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii (July 1963 – August 1964)
*Commander, 52d Fighter Wing (Air Defense) (McDonnell F-101 Voodoo) — Suffolk County Air Force Base, New York (August 17, 1964 – October 31, 1967)

Gabreski retired on November 1, 1967. Per his USAF official biography, he retired with more than 5,000 flying hours, 4,000 of them in jets.

===Distinguished Service Cross citation===

:Gabreski, Francis S.
:Lieutenant Colonel [then Major], U.S. Army Air Forces
:61st Fighter Squadron, 56th Fighter Group, Eighth Air force
:Date of Action: November 26, 1943

:Citation:

The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant Colonel (Air Corps), [then Major] Francis Stanley Gabreski, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-47 Fighter Airplane in the 61st Fighter Squadron, 56th Fighter Group, Eighth Air force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on November 26, 1943, in the European Theater of Operations. On this date, Colonel Gabreski led a flight of P-47 fighters on a bomber escort mission to targets near Oldenburg, Germany. With complete disregard for the danger involved, Colonel Gabreski led his flight into protected covering fighters. He personally attacked and destroyed the leading enemy aircraft and, despite damage sustained by his airplane from contact with falling pieces of the disintegrating enemy plane, sought out and destroyed another enemy fighter before returning to join his flight for further escort of the bombers. Colonel Gabreski&#x27;s outstanding and spirited aggressiveness and his heroic disregard for his personal safety in the face of superior enemy forces were an inspiration to his fellow pilots and reflect highest credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of the United States.

==Long Island Rail Road==
Following his retirement from the Air Force, Gabreski worked for Grumman Aerospace until August 1978. He was asked by New York Governor Hugh Carey to serve as president of the financially stressed and state-owned Long Island Rail Road in an attempt to improve the commuter line. Carey was opposed in the Democratic gubernatorial primary election by his own lieutenant governor, Maryanne Krupsak, and in part appointed Gabreski to enhance his election campaign based on Gabreski&#x27;s Polish extraction and Long Island affiliations.

After what he described as an 18-month struggle with the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Gabreski resigned on February 26, 1981. He charged that the creation of an executive director&#x27;s position, and its appointee, obstructed his efforts to improve service, replace equipment, and change its executive staff. However, a severe heat wave in the summer of 1980 that overwhelmed the commuter line&#x27;s air conditioning systems was apparently the final straw that forced his resignation.

==Personal life and death==
Francis and Kay Gabreski had nine children in 48 years of marriage. Two of their three sons graduated from the United States Air Force Academy and became career Air Force pilots. His daughter-in-law Terry L. Gabreski was promoted to lieutenant general in August 2005, the highest-ranking woman in the USAF until her retirement in 2010. His wife died as the result of an automobile accident as they both were returning from the Oshkosh Air Show on August 6, 1993. She was interred in Calverton National Cemetery, 25 miles from their home in Dix Hills.

Gabreski died of an apparent heart attack in Huntington Hospital, Long Island, New York on January 31, 2002, and is buried in Calverton National Cemetery. Gabreski&#x27;s funeral on February 6 was with full military honors and included a missing man formation flyover by F-15E Strike Eagles from the 4th Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina.

==Legacy==

Suffolk County Air Force Base in Westhampton Beach, New York, which became Suffolk County Airport in 1969, was renamed Francis S. Gabreski Airport in 1991. The collocated New York Air National Guard installation at the airport was also renamed Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base. In 1978, he was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

<doc id="773690" wikidata="Q578270" url="?curid=773690" title="Explosions in the Sky">
<text>Explosions in the Sky is an American post-rock band, formed in Austin, Texas in 1999. The band is a quartet, composed of drummer Chris Hrasky and guitarist/keyboardists Michael James, Munaf Rayani and Mark Smith. The band originally played under the name Breaker Morant, then changed to the current name in 1999. They primarily play with three electric guitars and a drum kit, although James will at times exchange his electric guitar for a bass guitar and all three guitarists also add additional keyboard and synthesizer parts. The band later added a fifth musician to their live performances, largely to accommodate for these bass and keyboard parts. This role was occupied by multi instrumentalist, Carlos Torres, from 2010 to 2018, and reprised in 2024. The band has released eight studio albums to date; their most recent, &quot;End&quot;, was released in September 2023.

The band has garnered popularity beyond the post-rock scene for their elaborately developed guitar work, narratively styled instrumentals – which they refer to as &quot;cathartic mini-symphonies&quot; – and their emotional live shows.

==History==
Originally called Breaker Morant, Explosions in the Sky was formed in Austin, Texas, in 1999. Drummer Chris Hrasky is from Rockford, Illinois, and the rest of the band hails from Midland, Texas. The new name of &quot;Explosions in the Sky&quot; came from a comment Hrasky made in reference to the noise or sight of fireworks when they left KVRX on the night they played their first set and recorded their first track, &quot;Remember Me as a Time of Day&quot;, that would be released on a compilation. Their 2000 debut album, &quot;How Strange, Innocence&quot;, was locally distributed in the form of CD-Rs. Rehearsal footage is featured on the feature film &quot;Cicadas&quot;, which won an Austin Film Festival award.

Explosions in the Sky quickly gained a reputation for themselves among other established bands such as Lift to Experience. Temporary Residence Limited signed the band on the strength of their demo after only half a listen; the demo was submitted by fellow Austin band The American Analog Set with a brief note saying, &quot;This totally fucking destroys.&quot;

They garnered a small amount of media attention with their second album, &quot;Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever&quot;, due to rumors linking it to the September 11, 2001 attacks. The band denied any connection in interviews. The album art shows an airplane with the caption &quot;This plane will crash tomorrow.&quot; There were false reports that the last track was called &quot;This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow&quot; and that the album was released on September 10, 2001; the concept had actually originated in 2000, and the album was officially released on September 4, 2001. Bassist Michael James was detained in an airport as a threat to security, and had to explain why his guitar contained the words &quot;this plane will crash tomorrow&quot;.

The band also received a considerable amount of attention playing before large audiences as the opening act of Fugazi&#x27;s spring 2002 US tour in support of &quot;The Argument&quot;.

The band released &quot;The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place&quot; in 2003 and this is generally considered their most famous album. The album has been described as a &quot;concept album&quot; and was stated by guitarist Munaf Rayani as the band&#x27;s attempt at love songs.

After being contacted by Brian Reitzell, Explosions in the Sky wrote the soundtrack for the 2004 film &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. Despite having access to rare equipment in the studio for that project, the band kept to their songwriting style in creating original material.

Their album &quot;The Rescue&quot; was written and recorded in eight days as part of the TRL &quot;Travels in Constants&quot; series. As such, the album was originally only available at the band&#x27;s live shows.

Explosions in the Sky&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone&quot;, which debuted February 20, 2007, exists as both a one-disc version and a two-disc special edition featuring remixes by multiple artists.
The band began touring on February 19 in the U.S. and Canada.

On April 26, 2011, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Take Care, Take Care, Take Care&quot;.

The band served as one of the support acts for Nine Inch Nails on their North American leg of the Twenty Thirteen Tour in late 2013, alternating dates with Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Following a period of seldom live shows across 2014 and 2015, the band returned in 2016 with their seventh studio album, &quot;The Wilderness&quot;. Two singles were released from the album prior to its April release: &quot;Separation Anxiety&quot; in January, and &quot;Logic of a Dream&quot; in February. The band toured extensively in support of the album throughout 2016 and into 2017, playing over 140 shows worldwide.

In April 2023, the band announced via their website their first North American tour since 2019. The tour was dubbed &quot;The End Tour&quot;, leading to speculation that the tour could be their last. On July 17, however, their official Twitter account announced the release of their eighth album, titled &quot;End&quot;, for September 15. In a press release for the announcement, they explained that the title came from &quot;the concept of an ending—death, or the end of a friendship or relationship&quot;, and does not imply that it would be the band&#x27;s final album.

==Musical style==

Explosions in the Sky is known for their &quot;cathartic, heavily dynamic instrumental rock&quot; sound, described as &quot;moody&quot; and &quot;crescendo-heavy&quot;.

Although the Explosions in the Sky is known for eschewing the conventions of popular music, Hrasky has compared the band&#x27;s use of hooks to those of pop music, &quot;like immediately grabbing your attention and getting to your emotions.&quot; Although many major publications have classified Explosions in the Sky as a post-rock group, Rayani has stated that the band members prefer to simply be called a &quot;rock band&quot;.

In a post-show interview clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani said about their status as instrumentalists, &quot;I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, and then it just kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn&#x27;t go back to it because we were comfortable enough.&quot; Drummer Chris Hrasky added, &quot;I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don&#x27;t think any of us want the sort of &#x27;leader role&#x27;, so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Most notably, Explosions in the Sky&#x27;s music is heavily featured in the &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; movie and television show. It is a common misconception that the band wrote and recorded the television show&#x27;s theme song. Instead, it is an original composition by W. G. Snuffy Walden. Music by Explosions in the Sky has been used in several television programs and commercials: &quot;The Birth and Death of the Day&quot; for the BBC documentary &quot;Lost Land of the Jaguar&quot;, &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;, &quot;Shopgirl&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Love the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;, as well as various songs for the PBS documentary &quot;The Street Stops Here&quot;.

<doc id="773691" wikidata="Q2090338" url="?curid=773691" title="Antarctica Service Medal">
<text>The Antarctica Service Medal (ASM) was established by the United States Congress on July 7, 1960, under of the 86th Congress. The medal was intended as a military award to replace several commemorative awards which had been issued for previous Antarctica expeditions from 1928 to 1941. With the creation of the Antarctica Service Medal, the following commemorative medals were declared obsolete;

* Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal
* Second Byrd Antarctic Expedition Medal
* United States Antarctic Expedition Medal

The Antarctica Service Medal is considered an award of the United States Armed Forces, issued in the name of the U.S. Department of Defense, and is authorized for wear on active duty uniforms. The medal may also be awarded to U.S. civilians and citizens of foreign nations who participate in a U.S. Antarctic expedition on the continent at the invitation of a participating U.S. agency (for example, National Science Foundation).

The Arctic equivalents of the Antarctica Service Medal are the Army Arctic Tab, Navy Arctic Service Ribbon, the Coast Guard Arctic Service Medal and the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Service Ribbon with Arctic &quot;A&quot; Device.

==Criteria==
To qualify for the Antarctica Service Medal, personnel must train or serve ten days stationed on the Antarctic continent, or aboard vessels in Antarctic waters, defined as south of 60 degrees latitude. Flight crews performing transport missions to Antarctica qualify for one day of service for each flight mission performed within a 24-hour time period. Civilians who work in a research facility or on a research vessel are also eligible to receive the Antarctica Service Medal through the National Science Foundation, provided that they also remain south of 60 degrees latitude for a cumulative period of 10 days, or 30 days if prior to October 10, 2008.

==Appearance==
The award is issued as a bronze medal, inches in diameter. Its obverse consists of a polar landscape view and standing figure in Antarctica clothing facing to the front between the horizontally placed words, &quot;ANTARCTICA&quot; on the figure&#x27;s left and &quot;SERVICE&quot; on the figure&#x27;s right.

On its reverse is a polar projection with geodesic lines of the continent of Antarctica across which are the horizontally placed words &quot;COURAGE&quot;, &quot;SACRIFICE&quot;, and &quot;DEVOTION&quot;, all within a circular decorative border of penguins and marine life.

The service ribbon is inches wide and consists of a -inch black stripe on each edge and graded from a white stripe in the center to a pale blue, light blue, greenish blue, and medium blue.
The outer bands of black and dark blue represent five months of Antarctic darkness; the center portion, by its size and colors – grading from medium blue through light blue and pale blue to white – symbolizes seven months of solar illumination, and also the aurora australis.

==Devices==

For those personnel performing extended winter service in Antarctica, a &quot;Wintered Over&quot; device is authorized. The &quot;Wintered Over&quot; bar is only worn on the full-size medal&#x27;s suspension ribbon. The smaller &quot;disc&quot; device is worn on the uniform ribbon to recognize this service.

The Wintered Over device is bestowed to indicate the number of winters served on the Antarctica continent. The device is worn as a disk on the award ribbon and is issued in bronze for one winter service, gold for two, and silver for three or more winters of service. On the full-sized medal a clasp is worn, issued in the same degree, inscribed with the words &quot;Wintered Over&quot;.

<doc id="773692" wikidata="Q6840799" url="?curid=773692" title="Mid-South Fair">
<text>The Mid-South Fair is a fair that was held for many years in Memphis, Tennessee, every year in late September and early October. It is now held in neighboring northwest Mississippi. It hosts many shows and attractions, as well as different types of rides and concession stands. Not only is it popular in the Memphis area, but also in the adjacent states of Mississippi and Arkansas, and even nearby Missouri. The fair&#x27;s official website states, &quot;As a non-profit organization, our mission is not to make money. Rather, the Fair exists to create a cultural and entertainment experience that exposes the people in our community to items and events they might not otherwise encounter. In addition, we serve as a focal point for all sorts of organizations and communities.&quot; 

The event was last held in Memphis from September 19–28, 2008, in its 152nd year. The fair has been held at the Lander&#x27;s Center in Southaven, Mississippi since September 2009.

==History==
The Shelby County Agricultural Society agreed to host the second fair in the fall of 1856. During World War I, the military used the Mid-South Fair to find recruits. In 1908, the name was changed to the Tri-State Fair to encourage more people in areas around Memphis to attend the fair, but this name did not stick. In 1911, African American Memphians, not allowed to participate fully in the activities due to the Jim Crow laws and customs of the era, founded the Negro Tri State Fair, which was discontinued in 1959.

In 2008, the city of Memphis announced that it would not renew the fair&#x27;s lease on the grounds, which is owned by the city. The fair then announced that it would move to the casino resort area in Tunica County, at a new site along U.S. Highway 61. The project was cancelled in 2009 due to poor economic conditions. The fair planned to temporarily use the Lander&#x27;s Center in Southaven as a temporary host; however, due to the cancellation of the Tunica project, this location has been used since 2009. The fair lasts two weeks and begins the last weekend in September each year.

==Attractions==
Events and attractions at the Mid-South Fair include a carnival midway and rides, concerts, a home-made ice cream contest, a horticulture contest, the Extreme Canines Stunt Dog Show, agricultural exhibits, a pig race, and the world&#x27;s largest youth talent contest. Since being first held in 1953, entrants in the talent contest have included Mississippi natives Elvis Presley and Lance Bass and Tennessee native Justin Timberlake.

<text>Protect (officially incorporated as National Association to Protect Children – PROTECT, Inc.) is a political organization established in 2002 and dedicated to the protection of children from abuse, exploitation, and neglect. It is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) membership association with members in every U.S. state and 10 nations. Protect achieved great success in its first three years, winning legislative victories in eight state legislatures.

==Support==
In 2005, the punk rock record label Fat Wreck Chords released a charity record for Protect, entitled &quot;&quot;. Fat Wreck Chords publicist Vanessa Burt and &quot;Verbicide Magazine&quot; publisher Jackson Ellis created the project, with the help of the head of Fat Wreck, Fat Mike.

In 2009, a second punk rock compilation charity record, &quot;Protect II: A Benefit for the National Association to Protect Children&quot;, was released jointly by Geykido Comet Records and Scissor Press. This album was spearheaded by &quot;Verbicide&quot; publishers Jackson Ellis and Nate Pollard, along with Shahab Zargari and Heela Naqshband of GC Records.

NYDM, New York Death Militia, a worldwide metal music organization, sponsors metal music shows in support of Protect.

<doc id="773703" wikidata="Q1073585" url="?curid=773703" title="Karatsu Castle">
<text>is a Japanese castle located in Karatsu, Saga Prefecture, Japan. It is a &quot;hirayamajiro&quot;, a castle built on a plain rather than a hill or mountain. At the end of the Edo period, Karatsu castle was home to the Ogasawara clan, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Karatsu Domain. It was also known as .

==Location==
Karatsu Castle, which stands beside Karatsu Bay, is unusual in that the stonework rises directly out of the water, using the ocean as a natural moat. It is a medium-size castle with the &quot;Honmaru&quot; (inner bailey) located on top of Mount Manto, the &quot;Ni-no-maru&quot; (2nd bailey) and the San-no-maru (3rd bailey) in the west, and the outer structures to the south.

The &quot;Ni-no-maru&quot; secondary bailey contained the palace of the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Karatsu and the domain’s administrative offices. The innermost bailey would normally contain a donjon; however there is considerable dispute as to whether or not it actually ever did. Records indicate that a stone foundation base existed from at least 1627, but the Tokugawa government never authorized the construction of a donjon tower. The present donjon is a modern reconstruction based on artists assumptions on what a Keichō period (1596–1615) donjon should look like.

== History ==
Terasawa Hirotaka, a retainer of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, became lord of Karatsu in 1595. In the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he joined the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu and attacked Gifu Castle. He was rewarded with greater lands around Karatsu, forming a dominion of 123,000 &quot;koku&quot;. In 1598, he abandoned his original castle of Nagoya Castle, and started work on a new castle at Karatsu, using many materials from the old one, from 1602 1608. The Tokugawa shogunate ordered neighboring &quot;tozama&quot; domains to contribute to its construction, and they did so primarily by excavating its network of moats. In 1637, in part due to his failure to suppress the Shimabara rebellion, his lands were confiscated by the Shogunate. Karatsu Domain was given over to the control of the Ōkubo clan (1649–1678), Matsudaira (Ogyū) clan (1678–1691), the Doi clan (1691–1762), Mizuno clan (1762–1817), until finally coming into the possession of the Ogasawara clan in 1762.

In June 1869, the title of daimyo was abolished, and in 1871, Karatsu Domain itself was abolished with the abolition of the han system, and became part of the new Saga Prefecture. Karatsu Castle was pulled down shortly afterwards, and in its place Maizuru Park was established in 1877.

The current donjon and some other structures of the castle were reconstructed in 1966 to boost local tourism and to function as a local museum. The current donjon features five tiers and five stories, with a lower ground floor; it also houses an exhibition area. Many of the &quot;yagura&quot; date from the same time, although the Tatsumi Yagura was added in 1990.

<doc id="773704" wikidata="Q1703258" url="?curid=773704" title="Jonathan Melvoin">
<text>Jonathan David Melvoin (December 6, 1961 – July 12, 1996) was an American musician, active in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Early life==
He was the son of Constance (née Ives) and Mike Melvoin, keyboardist for the Wrecking Crew, and brother of twins Susannah and Wendy Melvoin of Prince and the Revolution. He first learned to play drums at the age of five.

==Career==
Melvoin performed with many punk bands in the 1990s, such as the Dickies. He was also a member of the Family, a Prince side project band that produced the original recording of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;, &quot;Screams of Passion&quot; and &quot;Mutiny&quot;, and made musical contributions to many Wendy &amp; Lisa projects, as well as to Prince and the Revolution&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Around the World in a Day&quot;. He also played drums on &quot;Do U Lie?&quot; from the 1986 Prince and the Revolution album &quot;Parade&quot;. At the time of his death he was the touring keyboardist for the Smashing Pumpkins during their worldwide tour for the album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;.

==Death==
Melvoin died at age 34 as the result of a heroin overdose. Melvoin injected high purity heroin that was intended for snorting. He had previously consumed alcohol, which can lower the body&#x27;s drug tolerance. The Smashing Pumpkins were not invited to Melvoin&#x27;s funeral. Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin injected the same heroin that night, but survived to be arrested for possession. Several songs were inspired by Melvoin&#x27;s death, including the Sarah McLachlan song &quot;Angel&quot;, the Wendy &amp; Lisa song &quot;Jonathan&quot; (as Girl Bros.), and Prince&#x27;s &quot;The Love We Make&quot; from the album &quot;Emancipation&quot;.

<doc id="773711" wikidata="Q6761106" url="?curid=773711" title="Maria College">
<text>Maria College is a private Roman Catholic college in Albany, New York.

==History==
Maria College was founded in 1958 by the Religious Sisters of Mercy to serve as a sister formation college, an institution where aspiring Sisters of Mercy could receive a college degree that would qualify them to teach. Under the leadership of Maria College&#x27;s first President, Sister Mary Borromeo, the focus on educating only religious sisters slowly changed, and the college received permission to open its doors to the public in 1964.

Originally chartered by the New York Board of Regents as a junior college, Maria College offered a number of associate degrees in areas ranging from early childhood education to business management. Degree emphasis later changed to the health professions, with particular emphasis on nursing, physical therapy assistant and occupational therapy assistant programs. The charter was changed in September 2013 to allow Maria College to become a baccalaureate degree-granting institution, offering degrees in Liberal Arts, Psychology, Healthcare Management, Occupational Therapy, and Nursing.

In 2020, Maria College&#x27;s charter was changed to becoming a graduate degree-granting institution, and in Summer 2022 Maria&#x27;s first class of Master&#x27;s students graduated in the Occupational Therapy, MSOT program.

==Academics==
The college offers certificates as well as associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in a variety of disciplines. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.
Maria College is one of 17 colleges and universities sponsored by the national Conference for Mercy Higher Education network. Together the institutions in this network enroll more than 40,000 students throughout the United States.
