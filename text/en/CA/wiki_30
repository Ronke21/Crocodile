<text>Liam Dominic Byrne (born 2 October 1970) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, previously Birmingham Hodge Hill, since 2004. He served in Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s Cabinet from 2008 to 2010.

Byrne served in the Home Office under Prime Minister Tony Blair as Minister for Police and Counter-terrorism (2006) and Minister for Borders and Immigration (2006–08). He served in Gordon Brown&#x27;s Cabinet as Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 2008 to 2009. He deputised for Chancellor Alistair Darling at HM Treasury as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2009 to 2010. Upon his departure as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he notoriously left a note for his successor which read &quot;I&#x27;m afraid there is no money&quot;.

In Opposition, he attended Ed Miliband&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury (2010), then Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office (2010–11) and Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (2011–13). Following his demotion in 2013, Byrne continued to serve in junior Shadow Ministerial roles under Miliband and later Jeremy Corbyn.

Byrne was the Labour candidate for Mayor of the West Midlands in 2021, losing to the Conservative incumbent Andy Street. He is now the chair of the House of Commons Business and Trade Select Committee.

==Early life and career==
Liam Byrne was born on 2 October 1970 in Warrington. His father was a science teacher while his mother was a district council officer. He was state-educated at Burnt Mill School in Harlow, before completing his A-levels at the Hertfordshire and Essex High School in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. He studied History and Politics at the University of Manchester, graduating with a first, and whilst at university was elected Communications Officer of the University of Manchester Students&#x27; Union. Byrne was then a Fulbright Scholar at Harvard Business School, taking an MBA with honours from Harvard University.

Prior to his election to Parliament, he worked for Accenture and Rothschild &amp; Co, before co-founding a venture-backed technology company, e-Government Solutions Group, in 2000. In 1996/97, he advised the Labour Party on the re-organisation of its Millbank headquarters, and helped lead Labour&#x27;s business campaign.

==Parliamentary career==
===1st term (2004–2005)===
Byrne was selected to contest the Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election following the resignation of the veteran Labour MP Terry Davis to become the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. At the by-election, Byrne was elected to Parliament as MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill with 36.5% of the vote and a majority of 460. The campaign, led by MP Tom Watson, drew criticism from antiracists for its tactics, particularly a Labour leaflet proclaiming &quot;Labour is on your side – the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum seekers&quot;. Byrne himself said, &quot;I know that people here are worried about fraudulent asylum claims and illegal immigration. Yet the Lib Dems ignore what people say. They ignore what local people really want. The Lib Dems want to keep giving welfare benefits to failed asylum seekers. They voted for this in Parliament on 1 March 2004. They want your money – and mine – to go to failed asylum seekers&quot;.

Upon election, Byrne made his maiden speech on 22 July 2004 in which he condemned racial hatred.

===2nd term (2005–2010)===
At the 2005 general election, Byrne was re-elected as MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill with an increased vote share of 48.6% and an increased majority of 5,449. After the election, Byrne was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Care Services at the Department of Health led by Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt.

A vocal campaigner for Road Safety, Byrne handed a petition in to Parliament in 2005 demanding tougher punishments for dangerous drivers. He sat on the parliamentary committee that shaped the Road Safety Act 2006, which increased fixed penalty fines for driving while using a mobile. In November 2007, he was fined £100 and received three points on his driving licence for using his mobile phone while driving.

Following the 2006 local elections, he was promoted in place of Hazel Blears as Minister of State for Policing and Counter-terrorism at the Home Office. However, just a fortnight later Home Secretary John Reid transferred him to the Immigration role, switching portfolios with Tony McNulty. Byrne&#x27;s move was seen as an attempt by Reid to reorganise a dysfunctional immigrations system which Byrne completed, as well as establishing UK Border Agency, introduced a points system and developed the idea of earned citizenship. During this period he was also Minister for the West Midlands.

In November 2006, Byrne was responsible for a change to Immigration Rules preventing migrants who had entered under Britain&#x27;s Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) having permission to remain in Britain extended, unless they could show both that they had been earning at least £32,000 pa while in Britain and also that they had a good knowledge of English. This change was controversial because it applied retrospectively to immigrants who had entered Britain under the old rules, meaning the British Government had &quot;moved the goalposts&quot;–a degree became effectively an essential requirement, regardless of the skills or economic contribution that an individual could demonstrate.

In its report into the changes, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights said that &quot;The changes to the Rules are so clearly incompatible with Article 8, and so contrary to basic notions of fairness, that the case for immediately revisiting the changes to the Rules in Parliament is in our view overwhelming&quot;. Appeal cases have been won on appeal on the grounds that applicants had a legitimate expectation that the rules would not change to their detriment. A judicial review was successfully brought against the Government, with their actions when applying the new HSMP rules to those HSMP holders already in Britain as at 7 November 2006 being ruled as unlawful.

In May 2007, Byrne announced a consultation document which he said was about &quot;trying to create a much more hostile environment in this country if you are here illegally&quot;. This eventually led to the controversial Conservative Home Office hostile environment policy. Byrne was promoted in a Cabinet reshuffle on 3 October 2008, becoming Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

In June 2008, Byrne suggested the &quot;August bank holiday&quot; be made a weekend of national celebration in a speech to a New Labour think tank. Scotland&#x27;s August bank holiday being held on a different date from that in Wales and England, he later retracted his suggestion – after pressure from the Scottish National Party – saying he was merely trying to &quot;get the debate started&quot;.

In November 2008, an 11-page memo written by Byrne entitled &quot;Working With Liam Byrne&quot; was leaked to the press. In the memo, Byrne listed his demands from his staff, memorably including his requirement for a cappuccino on his arrival in the office, soup between 12:30 pm and 1 pm and an espresso at 3 pm. Byrne also instructed officials to tell him &quot;not what you think I should know, but you expect I will get asked&quot;. He warns staff that they should &quot;Never put anything to me unless you understand it and can explain it to me in 60 seconds... If I see things that are not of acceptable quality, I will blame you&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Byrne as an &quot;eager diva&quot;.

On leaving his position as Chief Secretary to the Treasury following the change of British Government in May 2010, Byrne left a note to his successor David Laws saying: &quot;Dear Chief Secretary, I&#x27;m afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam&quot;. Byrne later claimed that it was just typical humour between politicians but regretted it since the new government used it to justify the wave of cuts that were introduced. The note echoed Chancellor Reginald Maudling&#x27;s note to James Callaghan: &quot;Good luck, old cock ... Sorry to leave it in such a mess&quot; after the Conservatives&#x27; defeat at the 1964 election. This note was frequently referenced by the following coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to criticise the financial record of the previous Labour Government, and used as a visual prop by David Cameron in the &quot;Question Time&quot; debate preceding the 2015 general election. After the party&#x27;s election defeat, Byrne stated he had been &quot;burnt with shame&quot; since 2010 over the note which had harmed the 2015 election campaign.

=== 3rd term (2010–2015) ===
At the 2010 general election, Byrne was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 52% and an increased majority of 10,302. Following the election, Byrne was appointed by Ed Miliband to lead Labour&#x27;s policy review for two years. 

He was Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions from January 2011 to October 2013. Byrne was sacked after increasing criticism from Labour members and having &quot;badly lost the confidence of the PLP&quot;, particularly after allegedly describing the Conservative-led coalition&#x27;s benefits cap as &quot;too soft&quot;, saying that &quot;Ministers have bodged the rules so the cap won&#x27;t affect Britain&#x27;s 4,000 largest families and it does nothing to stop people living a life on welfare&quot;.

He is the Chairman of the APPG on Inclusive Growth, formed in July 2014 upon the request of the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the aim of finding a new consensus on inclusive growth to ensure the benefits of growth are enjoyed by all sectors of society.

=== 4th term (2015–2017) ===
Byrne was again re-elected at the 2015 general election with an increased vote share of 68.4% and an increased majority of 23,362.

He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

=== 5th term (2017–2019) ===
Byrne was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 81.1% and an increased majority of 31,026. 

Byrne is a member of the Labour Friends of Israel and of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East.

=== 6th term (2019–2024) ===
He was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 78.7% and a decreased majority of 28,655.

In April 2022, Byrne was found to have bullied a staff member; he was suspended from the House of Commons for two days after a 22-month investigation. The investigation began when a complaint was lodged with the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS); the Independent Expert Panel found that Byrne ostracised a former assistant, David Barker, after a minor office dispute, specifically ignoring Barker for three months, including when Barker alerted Byrne as having COVID-19. Kathryn Stone, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, decreed Byrne&#x27;s behaviour as being a &quot;significant misuse of power&quot;; and also found Byrne&#x27;s decision to disable Barker&#x27;s access to his parliamentary IT account as having a &quot;punitive&quot; effect, stating that this was &quot;disproportionate and amounted to malicious behaviour&quot;. Following the publication of the ICGS report, Byrne apologised stating that he was &quot;profoundly sorry&quot;.

In May 2023, Byrne was found to have misused public expenses. Byrne denied wrongdoing, but the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) found there was &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that a member of Byrne&#x27;s staff had worked on his failed mayoral election campaign during office hours, conservatively estimating that at least around 1,000 hours of public-funded time had been spent on the campaign. MPs may not use taxpayer-funded allowances for political campaigns; Byrne was not asked to repay the funds because the total hours worked by the staff member could not be established with some evidence in the report suggesting the hours could be in the thousands. Byrne stated subsequently he accepted the findings but refused to apologise.

=== 7th term (2024–) ===

Due to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Byrne&#x27;s constituency of Birmingham Hodge Hill was abolished, and replaced with Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North. Byrne was elected to Parliament as MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North at the 2024 general election with 31.2% of the vote and a majority of 1,566. On the Chancellor Address to the Kings Speech Byrne called on the Reeves to encourage further measures including promotion of business the help civic society, review of all investments and shares held by the government

=== Mayoral candidate for the West Midlands ===
In February 2020, Byrne was selected as the Labour candidate for the 2021 West Midlands mayoral election. He came second with 46% of the vote behind the Conservative candidate Andy Street.

In his campaign he called for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games to be the &quot;greenest games ever&quot;, and pledged to be the first West Midlands Mayor to fill the role of Deputy Mayor with a woman and to revitalise the West Midlands&#x27; ailing car industry by positioning it at the heart of British electric vehicle manufacturing. His official campaign slogan was &#x27;A new future for the heart of Britain&#x27;, although he said that his unofficial slogan was &#x27;let&#x27;s just get shit done&#x27;.

== Personal life ==
Byrne married Sarah Harnett in 1998; the couple have three children.

<text>Joseph Pulitzer III (May 13, 1913 – May 26, 1993) was an American newspaperman and publisher of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; for 38 years. A grandson of the famous newsman Joseph Pulitzer, for 31 years he chaired the board which was responsible for awarding the Pulitzer Prize, and from 1955 to 1993 was chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing Company.

==Biography==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri on May 13, 1913, he was baptized in the Episcopal Church as Joseph Pulitzer III, but later adopted the junior designation (his father had dropped the junior designation after the death of his father). A graduate of the St. Mark&#x27;s School and Harvard University, Pulitzer ran the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; through the social and political challenges of the 20th century while holding fast to the liberal vision set out by his grandfather in 1907. His paper was among the first to oppose the Vietnam War.

He served as chairman of the Pulitzer Prize Board at Columbia University for 31 years and was the last member of the Pulitzer family to directly participate in the Prize process to date. Along with Columbia University president William J. McGill and Pulitzer Prize administrator John Hohenberg, he oversaw its transition from an advisory group under the aegis of the Columbia trustees to the principal award-granting body in 1975. The board, which had been established by his grandfather&#x27;s will, is responsible for selecting the coveted annual prizes in journalism, books, drama and music.

In 1993, he received an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Washington University in St. Louis.

In addition to his reputation as a newsman, Pulitzer was also known for his collection of contemporary art, regarded as one of the largest and finest in the world. In 2008, his second wife, Emily Rauh Pulitzer, gave a gift of 31 major works of modern and contemporary art and $45 million to the Harvard Art Museum. In announcing the gift, the museum also announced that between 1953 and 2005 it had received gifts of 43 other modern and contemporary works from Pulitzer and his first wife, Louise Vauclain Pulitzer, who died in 1968, and from Pulitzer and his second wife.

Pulitzer died at his home in the Central West End of St. Louis from colon cancer. He was 80.

<text>Boris Karlovich Pugo (, ; 19 February 1937 – 22 August 1991) was a Soviet communist politician of Latvian origin.

==Early life and education==
Pugo was born in Kalinin, Russian SFSR (now Tver, Russia) into a family of Latvian communists. They had left Latvia after Latvia was proclaimed an independent country in 1918, and the Communist side was defeated in the war that followed. His father, Karl Janovich Pugo, was a participant in the October Revolution and the Civil War as a member of the Latvian Riflemen. His family returned to Latvia after the Soviet Union occupied and annexed it in 1940.

Pugo graduated from Riga Polytechnical Institute in 1960 and worked in various Komsomol, Communist Party and Soviet government positions, both in Latvia and Moscow.

== Party career ==
Pugo served in various positions between 1960 and 1984 including the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol of the Latvian SSR, a secretary of the Central Committee of Komsomol of the USSR, the First Secretary of the Riga City Committee of the Communist Party and chairman of the KGB in Latvia.

Pugo was the first secretary of the Communist Party of Latvia from 14 April 1984 to 4 October 1989. Pugo also served as chairman of the Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1989 to 1991.

Between 1990 and 1991, Pugo was the Minister of Interior Affairs of the USSR.

== August coup and death ==
Pugo participated in the August coup in 1991 and as the Minister of the Interior firmly supported measures to suppress opposition to the coup. After the coup had failed, Pugo died by suicide, anticipating arrest. He was contacted by the RSFSR prosecution for a meeting and he shot himself minutes after the phone call. His wife Valentina Ivanovna also died by suicide, although sources from the time were uncertain as to whether she killed herself or was killed by her husband.

The establishment followed the recommendation of the UK government Committee on Higher Education (Robbins Committee), one of whose recommendations being the replacement of the diploma-awarding National Council for Technological Awards with a degree-awarding council. That gave colleges more flexibility, as they could devise their own courses with the oversight of the council, rather than depend on existing universities to accredit courses. In 1974, the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design was merged into the CNAA.

The CNAA&#x27;s Latin motto, as it appears on its coat of arms, is: &quot;Lauream qui Meruit Ferat&quot;: this can be translated as &#x27;let whoever earns the laurel bear it&#x27;.

== Qualifications ==
Qualifications included diplomas, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctorate research degrees; by the time of dissolution, it had awarded over 1.3 million degrees and other academic awards. The CNAA awarded academic degrees at polytechnics, central institutions and other non-university institutions such as colleges of higher education until they were awarded university status. When the CNAA was wound up, the British government asked the Open University to continue the work of awarding degrees in the remaining non-university institutions. Additionally, the OU has responsibility for CNAA records.

The CNAA, through its many subject panels, oversaw the degree-awarding powers of polytechnics. Above all, the CNAA saw itself as preserving a comparability at the national level with degree level awards in universities, a feature which can be seen as having both positive and negative aspects: positive in that it preserved a formal &quot;parity of esteem&quot; between the awards of the two parts of the binary system (such as retaining the common currency of the undergraduate degree for entry to postgraduate study), but other scholars viewed it as negative because it encouraged an &quot;academicism&quot; in the new sector and slowed an acceptance of the transformations required finally to break the boundaries of the old, &quot;elite&quot; system. In the event, the polytechnics were associated with many innovations, including women&#x27;s studies, the academic study of communications and media, sandwich degrees, advanced engineering degrees in all functional specialities, and the rise of management and business studies; not least, they were much more responsive than older institutions in providing for the admission of non-standard students from technical colleges, advanced apprenticeships and other sources.

== Patronage and governance ==
The presidents of the Council for National Academic Awards were:

* The Duke of Edinburgh, 1965 to 1976
* The Prince of Wales, 1976 to 1989
* The Princess Royal, 1989 to 1993.

The Council comprised a chairman and 21 to 25 members all appointed by the secretary of state for education. The CNAA&#x27;s seven chairmen were:

* Sir Harold Roxbee Cox, Lord Kings Norton, 1964 to 1971 
* Sir Michael John Sinclair Clapham, 1971 to 1977
* Sir Denis Rooke, 1978 to 1983
* Sir Alastair Pilkington, 1983 to 1987
* Sir Ronald Ernest Dearing, Lord Dearing, 1987 to 1988
* Sir Bryan Nicholson, 1988 to 1991
* Sir Raymond Mildmay Wilson Rickett, 1991 to 1993

== Academic dress ==
For graduation ceremonies the CNAA had its own academic dress comprising gown, hood and headwear. The bachelors’ gown was a black Cambridge pattern worn twelve inches off the ground with sleeves reaching the elbow; the doctors’ and masters’ gowns were a standard black Oxbridge pattern worn eight inches off the ground; PhD gowns had a maroon silk yoke and facings; higher doctorates had a gold-yellow gown with cream brocade facings. Hoods were a gold-yellow panama, with a silk lining: turquoise for bachelors’; white for masters’; turquoise with a white facing for a MEng; maroon for a PhD; cream damask for higher doctors. Bachelors’ and masters’ wore a black mortar board; PhDs a cloth bonnet with a maroon cord; higher Doctors had a velvet Tudor bonnet with a gold cord.

<doc id="765273" wikidata="Q575350" url="?curid=765273" title="Dun Karm Psaila">
<text>Carmelo Psaila, better known as Dun Karm Psaila (Żebbuġ, 18 October 1871 – 13 October 1961) was a Maltese Roman Catholic priest, writer and poet, sometimes called the &quot;bard of Malta&quot;. He is widely recognised as the Maltese national poet and as the lyricist for the Maltese national anthem ().

== Life ==
He was educated at the seminary between the years 1885 and 1894 and then proceeded to study philosophy in 1888 and theology in 1890 the University of Malta. He was ordained as a priest in 1894. From 1895 to 1921 he taught various subjects at the seminary: Italian, Latin, English, arithmetic, geography, cosmography, ecclesiastical history and Christian archaeology. In 1921 he was appointed assistant librarian at the National Library of Malta and in 1923 director of circulating libraries, a post he held till his retirement in 1936.

Dun Karm was one of the founding members of the (founded in 1921) and on the death of Ġużè Muscat Azzopardi in 1927, he was elected president of the Għaqda and later editor of the official organ, &#x27;. He carried out these functions till 1942 when he was nominated honorary president of the &#x27; for life. In recognition of his contribution to Maltese literature, he was granted a D.Litt. (honoris causa) by the Royal University of Malta in 1945 - the first time the university granted such an honour. A year later he was awarded the Ġużè Muscat Azzopardi gold medal. Queen Elizabeth II decorated him with the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1956. In 1957 the Maltese government issued him an ex-gratia pension in recognition of his services to Maltese literature.

== Works ==

Dun Karm is best known as the author the verses of a good number of popular religious hymns in Maltese, including the Maltese national anthem. In 1921, Albert Laferla, the director of education, asked Dun Karm to compose some verses to a music score by Robert Samut. The &quot;Innu Malti&quot; was sung for the first time in 1923. In 1941 it was officially designated the national anthem, a status confirmed by the Constitution when Malta gained independence in 1964. Yet, Dun Karm is not deemed the Maltese national poet merely because he wrote the text of the national anthem but rather for having written prolifically in Maltese, and producing works conscious of a &quot;Maltese identity&quot;. Dun Karm was conscious that his identity, that of most people who inhabited the Maltese islands, could not be too easily collapsed into an extended form of the &quot;Britishness&quot;, &quot;Italianità del Risorgimento&quot; or &quot;Italianità cattolica&quot;, which were the subject of endless political debates among the intellectuals of the time. Yet, Dun Karm is rarely labelled a &quot;nationalist&quot; or a &quot;patriot&quot; in the way such terms are usually used in the English language: he sought to put his finger on the identity of the common people of the islands, while not trying to mimic the national identities of the major European polities by the Romantic movement as a reaction to the cosmopolitanism of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

His first works in Italian reveal an early life of peace and calm; after the death of his mother, solitude became his companion. Such solitude is present throughout his works, eventually accompanied by a high degree of spiritual balance. Some of his poems illustrate an inner journey of sentimental and moral experience. Nonetheless, besides expressing such subjectivity, Dun Karm&#x27;s works also give voice to his country&#x27;s collective aspirations. His poetry reflects a background of village life with an atmosphere of family feelings and it also portrays the Maltese countryside with a perspective imagination. It synthesises the popular culture of the Maltese people, which is evident from the rural characteristics that furnish its local identity with the literary culture based largely on Italian romanticism. When he decided to make Maltese the medium of his creativity, Dun Karm poetically explored the history of Malta to confirm its cultural and national identity. Both the personal and the national sentiments are treated from a deeply religious viewpoint that discusses existentialism. The spiritual crisis in is analysed in universal human terms that illuminate human existence and insist on the ineffable relation that exists between God and the human person, while pointing to the need of the latter&#x27;s absolute acceptance of the former&#x27;s hidden power.

Before 1912 Dun Karm only wrote in Italian. His first known published poem is (1889) after which he published 

 (1896) and (1903) another collection of Italian poems. In 1912, Dun Karm wrote &quot;,&quot; his first poem in Maltese, which appeared in the first issue of the Maltese periodical &quot;Il-Ħabib&quot;, published by Pawl Galea and Ġużè Muscat Azzopardi. His best-known poems include &quot;Il-Musbieħ tal-Mużew&quot; (1920).

Dun Karm&#x27;s writings include &#x27; (translated in 1934 from an Italian novel by D. Caprile) Besides these he wrote a few critical works. He also compiled a dictionary between 1947 and 1955 in three volumes, &#x27;.

=== Translations ===
A.J. Arberry translated about 37 of Dun Karm&#x27;s poems into English, Ġużè Delia translated &#x27; into Spanish and Laurent Ropa translated &#x27; into French. Carmel Mallia translated the latter into Esperanto. Yevgeniy Vitkovskiy translated &#x27;, &#x27;, and &quot;&quot; into Russian.

<doc id="765282" wikidata="Q3149647" url="?curid=765282" title="In Nomine (role-playing game)">
<text>In Nomine is a role-playing game designed by Derek Pearcy and published in 1997 by Steve Jackson Games, based on the French game &quot;In Nomine Satanis/Magna Veritas&quot;. Players typically assume the role of angels and demons in a setting that draws heavily from traditional Christianity. 

== Setting ==
The game combines the supernatural with mundane reality, with campaigns often set in the modern world. Supernatural characters take on a human (or other mundane) form to further their various agendas. Although individual campaigns can focus on combat or direct conflict, Heaven and Hell settled into a cold war called the &quot;Great Game&quot;. Angels and demons typically struggle indirectly, by attempting to draw humans closer to their respective sides. Open hostilities are costly, and, in the game setting, rarely prove to be the most efficient option. This allows &quot;In Nomine&quot; to have the qualities of a morality play as well as those of a more standard role-playing game.

Angels and demons, collectively termed celestials, are sorted into different Choirs (angelic) or Bands (demonic). Musical themes permeate the literature. For example, all of creation is collectively termed &quot;The Symphony&quot;, and &quot;spells&quot; do not exist; celestial powers are either Resonances, Attunements, or Songs. Every Choir or Band has a &quot;resonance&quot; associated with it, a unique way in which they interact with the Symphony that functions as a supernatural ability.

A celestial generally also has two sets of &quot;dissonance conditions&quot; that determine how they acquire notes of dissonance. One set comes from the base Choir or Band, and the other set comes from the Word they serve. Violating these conditions involves fundamentally rejecting their identity (for demons) or their place in the Symphony (for angels), and this rejection manifests itself in dissonance. Dissonance impairs a celestial&#x27;s abilities in certain ways, and is keyed to spiritual anguish. For example, Seraphim see lies plainly (via use of their resonance) and in turn cannot bring themselves to lie without betraying their natures (which earns them dissonance). Acquiring notes of dissonance, in turn, interferes with their ability to use their resonance. Thus, once an angel starts distancing itself from the Symphony, it runs the risk of getting caught in a vicious cycle that leads it further and further from its angelic nature - and down the path to Falling. Bands do not tend to have a similar problem; a demon typically requires Superior intervention, whereas an angel can Fall spontaneously by itself.

Angels and demons usually work for one of the thirteen main Archangels or fourteen main Demon Princes. These are celestials who are each bound to a powerful &quot;Word,&quot; or fundamental concept. Not every Word-bound celestial is a Superior; only the most important, most powerful, and most knowledgeable earn Superior status. For instance, Michael is the Archangel of War. Doxas, Angel of Glory, is his lieutenant and, while respected, does not bear the title and responsibilities of Archangel. Generally, angels must ask their Superior to sponsor them for a Word before the Seraphim Counsel. Once they have asked their superior if they may be granted a word, they will have to explain their reasoning for being gifted this honour. If their answer is to their superior&#x27;s satisfaction, then they will be brought before the Seraphim council where they will be given a task to perform (usually in some way related to the word they seek to obtain). If there are any other angels who wish to also have this word, they would be tested simultaneously. The one who successfully completes the task to the best of his/her ability would then be granted the word.

Demons have a similar task, rallying support for becoming Word-bound. But because there is no demonic equivalent of the Seraphim council, they have to either request their Superior intercede for them, or go into Lower Hell and speak with Lucifer himself on the matter. Depending on his mood, he might kill them on the spot, grant them a Word on the spot, or give them a task to fulfill, but completing a task does not ensure the word is theirs; he may deny them the word, grant them a lesser word, or grant them a word they didn&#x27;t want.

The Archangel or Demon Prince which a character works for shapes their nature, personality, abilities, and restrictions as much as their Choir or Band. Words can change subtly if a Demon Prince redeems or an Archangel Falls - for instance, Andrealphus, the Demon Prince of (selfish) Lust, was once the Archangel of (selfless) Love. Both Heaven and Hell (especially the latter) are divided on many important matters. For example, Michael&#x27;s militant stance towards Hell clashes with that of Novalis, the peace-loving Archangel of Flowers, and that of Jean, Archangel of Lightning, who favors a moderate approach between the two extremes. Most Archangels are hesitant to support one particular religion, but Dominic (Judgment) and Laurence (the Sword) take extra pains to promote Catholicism, while Khalid (Faith) is avowedly Muslim.

The game offers no definitive answer as to whether the fallen angels had justification to rebel, although, in practice, most games tend to default to the assumption that Heaven is in fact seeking to further the overall cause of good, and Hell to undermine it. One can play a &quot;backwards&quot; game as freedom fighters based in Hell fighting against angelic oppression just as easily as a &quot;straight&quot; game sympathetic to the angels. To accommodate both these perspectives, game literature often describes a morally gray universe, where angelic and demonic forces sometimes work together for mutual benefit. Both Heaven and Hell are home to a great many political schemers and powerful secret police.

Supplements to the line include books on humans (aware or unaware of the conflict) and ethereal spirits (creatures born of dreams), which can be player characters or non-player characters.

==System==
The default mechanic of the system is the &quot;d666.&quot; This consists of a roll of three six-sided dice; the first two are added together and compared to a target number to determine success or failure, the third determines the degree of success or failure. The third digit is often referred to as the &quot;check digit,&quot; or &quot;CD.&quot; Rolling all 1s or all 6s results in an &quot;intervention&quot; - divine or infernal, respectively - essentially filling the role of a spectacular success or failure. However, how it affects the player depends on the side he has chosen. Rolling 1, 1, 1 (the Holy Trinity) is a Divine Intervention and always benefits Heaven, making it a critical success for an angelic player, but a critical failure for a demonic player. Rolling 6, 6, 6 (the Number of the Beast, sometimes referred to as the freight train from Hell) results in an Infernal Intervention which has the opposite effects.

Though there are numerous powers players can purchase with experience or earn through missions, the rules themselves are at a level of simplicity that stands in stark contrast to the complex politics and baroque cosmology. Most agree that this results in &quot;In Nomine&quot; achieving flexibility and simplicity, but not game balance.

===&quot;GURPS&quot;===
GURPS In Nomine is a third edition &quot;GURPS&quot; adaptation of the &quot;In Nomine&quot; setting released in June 2000.

In the November 1997 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 241), Rick Swan complimented Steve Jackson Games for tackling &quot;a volatile premise head on.&quot; While he liked the streamlined rules, Swan thought the game&#x27;s most impressive achievement &quot;is not a vivid setting nor its imaginative mechanics, but its respectful, even reverent treatment of a sensitive subject.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Ambitious, chilling and absolutely, positively not for children. Or Jerry Falwell.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted that this game &quot;takes itself rather seriously. The world of &quot;In Nomine&quot; is surprisingly, emphatically rendered in shades of gray ... The game never chooses a side — good and bad outcomes are a matter of perspective.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;In Nomine&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1997&quot;.

<text>Iron Man and Sub-Mariner is a one-shot comic book published by Marvel Comics in 1968. It is notable for being the first Marvel title to be intentionally published for only one issue, as it existed to use up two half-length stories left over after Marvel began its expansion and the characters were to be given their own solo titles.

&quot;Iron Man and Sub-Mariner&quot; does not feature a team-up of the title characters, nor a complete story for either. The Iron Man tale is continued from &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #99 (cover-dated March 1968) and continues in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #1 (May 1968). The Sub-Mariner story continues from &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #101 (March 1968), and continues in &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #1 (May 1968). The cover-logo trademark uses &quot;and&quot; while the copyrighted title noted in the postal indicia uses an ampersand.

The stories were: an 11-page Iron Man tale, &quot;The Torrent Without, The Tumult Within&quot;, written by Archie Goodwin, with art by penciler Gene Colan and inker Johnny Craig, a former EC Comics mainstay; and an 11-page Sub-Mariner story, &quot;Call Him Destiny, or Call Him Death&quot;, written by Roy Thomas, with art by Colan and inker Frank Giacoia. Stan Lee was the editor for both stories. The latter tale retold the Sub-Mariner&#x27;s origin and introduced the supervillain Destiny.

At least one previous Marvel title had lasted only one issue, though unintentionally. &quot;Red Raven Comics&quot; #1 (Aug. 1940), from Marvel predecessor company Timely Comics, became &quot;The Human Torch&quot; with issue #2, dropping all features from the debut issue. The Grand Comics Database notes of the first and only issue, &quot;No blurbs at the end of the stories in this issue indicate that there will be a &quot;Red Raven Comics&quot; #2. Instead they all advertise either &quot;Marvel Mystery Comics&quot; or in one case &quot;Mystic Comics&quot;, suggesting that perhaps &quot;Red Raven Comics&quot; was cancelled even before it went to press.&quot;

==Reprints==
&quot;Iron Man &amp; Sub-Mariner&quot; #1 has been reprinted in two &quot;Essential Marvel&quot; collections, &quot;Iron Man&quot; vol. 2 (2004, ) and &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; vol. 1 (2009, ).

<text>Nigel Oscar Weiss FRS (16 December 1936 – 24 June 2020) was an astronomer and mathematician, and leader in the field of astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics. He was Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge.

==Education==
Born in South Africa, Weiss studied at Hilton College, Natal, Rugby School and Clare College, Cambridge, and had been a fellow of Clare College since 1965. He read for his PhD in 1961 with a thesis on Variable Hydromagnetic Motions. 

==Career==
In 1987 he became Professor of Mathematical Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge.

Between 2000 and 2002 he was President of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 2007 was awarded the Gold Medal, the society&#x27;s highest award.

==Research==
Weiss published extensively in the field of mathematical astrophysics, specialising in solar and stellar magnetic fields, astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics and nonlinear dynamical systems.

In 1966 he was the first to demonstrate and describe the process of &#x27;flux expulsion&#x27; by which a conducting fluid undergoing rotating motion acts to expel the magnetic flux from the region of motion, a process now known to occur in the photosphere of the Sun and other stars.

==Awards and honours==
Weiss was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1992. His nomination reads

<doc id="765299" wikidata="Q888492" url="?curid=765299" title="Ptolemy Eupator">
<text>Ptolemy Eupator (, &quot;Ptolemaios Eupatōr&quot;, &quot;Ptolemy the Well-fathered [God]&quot;) was the son of Ptolemy VI Philometor and Cleopatra II, and for a short time in 152 BC reigned as co-ruler on Cyprus with his father. It is thought that Ptolemy Eupator died in August of that same year.

Ptolemy Eupator is attested on small number of documents and inscriptions: he is mentioned in a demotic papyrus held by the British Museum, is referenced as a priest of the cult of Alexander during 158–157 BC, and that he was a co-regent with his father in 152 BC. Ptolemy Eupator was probably aged 12 or 13 when he died. His name was added to the list of deified Ptolemies, ahead of that of his father, whom he predeceased.

When Ptolemy Eupator was first discovered in the lists of deified Ptolemies (which was actually arranged in order of death and deification, not reign), there was a theory that he was an elder brother of his father, and reigned before him. As a result, some 19th-century texts count Ptolemy Philometor as &quot;Ptolemy VII&quot; (instead of &quot;Ptolemy VI&quot;), and increment the numbers of all later Ptolemies by one until &quot;Ptolemy XVI Caesarion&quot; (instead of &quot;Ptolemy XV&quot;). The epithets, which have come down from antiquity, are unchanged. 

The discovery of a tomb alleged to be his, on Cyprus, was announced in 2017.

<doc id="765308" wikidata="Q2545743" url="?curid=765308" title="Black Liberation Army">
<text>The Black Liberation Army (BLA) was an underground Marxist–Leninist, black-nationalist militant organization that operated in the United States from 1970 to 1981. Composed of former Black Panthers (BPP) and Republic of New Afrika (RNA) members who served above ground before going underground, the organization&#x27;s program was one of war against the United States government, and its stated goal was to &quot;take up arms for the liberation and self-determination of black people in the United States.&quot; Groups calling themselves the BLA carried out bombings, killings of police officers and random Caucasians, robberies (which participants termed &quot;expropriations&quot;), and prison breaks.

== Background ==
The eventual emergence of the Black Liberation Army was made possible by several clandestine organizations and an &#x27;underground&#x27; armed wing of the Black Panther Party, dispersed throughout the United States, which prioritized armed self-defense and struggle against the police and white vigilantism. 

One such organization was the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), founded in 1962 in close association with self-defense advocates like Queen Mother Moore and Robert F. Williams, but also communist intellectuals like James and Grace Lee Boggs. In 1964 Robert Williams published a study of the possibilities of guerrilla warfare in the United States in RAM&#x27;s paper &quot;The Crusader&quot;, which helped popularize clandestine armed tactics in RAM and adjacent circles. It was the first step in a transition from armed self-defense to armed struggle against a political enemy.The new concept is to huddle as close to the enemy as possible so as to neutralize his modern and fierce weapons. The new concept creates conditions that involve the total community, whether they want to be involved or not. It sustains a state of confusion and destruction of property. It dislocates the organs of harmony and order and reduces central power to the level of a helpless, sprawling, octopus. During the hours of day sporadic rioting takes place and massive sniping. Night brings all out warfare, organized fighting and unlimited terror against the oppressor and his forces.A later article on the same topic specified some of the tactics that black armed groups would have to use in the United States:Armed defense guards would have to be formed throughout the land. These groups would be organized within the confines of the law and when possible become sporting rifle clubs affiliated with the National Rifle Association. They would function only as defense units to safeguard life, limb and property in the ghetto communities. Some form of central direction would be necessary. A tightly organized and well disciplined underground guerilla force would also have to be formed to perform a more aggressive mission.In New York City, RAM cadre were the armed security for Malcolm X after his split from the Nation of Islam. In 1966, members of RAM would guide the nascent New York branch of the Black Panther Party through political education and established its armed wing, then called the Black Guards. These RAM cadre would influence the East coast BPP&#x27;s more militant tactical outlook when compared with the Oakland headquarters.

The Black Panther Party on the West coast &quot;differed with RAM&#x27;s clandestine posture&quot; but nonetheless &quot;organized an underground from its earliest days.&quot; This underground armed wing was decentralized, formed out of cells communicating on a need-to-know basis, all &quot;part of a movement concept called the Black Liberation Army.&quot; Its membership was broader than the BPP&#x27;s, and incorporated gangs whose leadership had been folded into the Party. Bunchy Carter, as the BPP&#x27;s Southern California Minister of Defense, incorporated some of the Slausons, a gang which he had formerly led, to build a clandestine armed wing for the Party. After Carter was assassinated in a FBI-orchestrated feud with the US Organization in 1969, Geronimo Pratt assumed leadership of the BPP&#x27;s underground armed wing. In this capacity he organized underground formations throughout the United States, especially in the South.

Huey Newton&#x27;s release from prison in 1970 would destabilize the fragile peace between the West and East coast Black Panther Party, and would reverse course on clandestine militancy in the South which Pratt had initiated during Newton&#x27;s imprisonment. FBI counterintelligence operations were designed to inflame existing tensions and prevent cooperation between disparate representatives of the black liberation movement. A combination of this meddling and the influence of BPP members convinced Newton to expel Geronimo Pratt from the Party, denounce the BPP membership involved in arming and training Southern cadre, and eventually expel the entire New York chapter of the Black Panther Party from the organization. This expulsion took shape on tactical lines: Newton was uncomfortable with a national network of clandestine armed units answerable to Pratt but not to him, and was concerned that the armed wing was outpacing the Party&#x27;s above-ground initiatives. 

Simultaneous with the establishment and breakdown of the Black Panther Party was the rise and plateau of the Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika, which envisioned the establishment of a sovereign state in the Black belt. This project took on a project proposed by Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, and involved many of RAM&#x27;s early supporters, including Queen Mother Moore and Robert F. Williams, along with former SNCC chairman H. Rap Brown. Veterans of the BPP, PG-RNA, RAM itself, and other local organizations would populate the BLA.

== Formation and Development ==
Because it was not an official organization, was not centrally coordinated, and consisted of multiple groups with different timelines, it is difficult to note exactly when and where the BLA emerged out of the pre-existing underground. In some cities, the Black Liberation Army was not connected to or aware of other more coordinated groups of cells, as was the case in Philadelphia, where the BLA formed out of repeat members of the Black Unity Council and the city&#x27;s chapter of the Black Panther Party. During its early years, as member Assata Shakur notes, it &quot;was not a centralized, organized group with a common leadership and chain of command. Instead, there were various organizations and collectives working together and simultaneously independent of each other.&quot; At least by 1970, due to police and FBI sabotage, infiltration, internal disunity, mass imprisonment of members, lengthy prison sentences, and the assassination of key members including Fred Hampton, the party&#x27;s membership was shrinking and its leadership was responding by closing ranks. Many former Panthers defected to the BLA after Eldridge Cleaver&#x27;s expulsion from the Party during this period. Others simply emphasized clandestinity and armed struggle in response to police repression and assassinations. The New York chapter of the BLA was committed to &quot;defend Black people, to fight for Black people, and to organize Black people militarily, so they can defend themselves through a people&#x27;s army and people&#x27;s war.&quot;

The BLA was initially decentralized and autonomous, split geographically and without pretense to ideological unity beyond endorsement of black liberation and typically revolutionary socialism. By the mid-1970s, however, ideological fractures had emerged within the milieu, and &quot;a &#x27;Call to Consolidate&#x27;&quot; titled &#x27;Message to the Black Movement&#x27; &quot;was issued to create a unified organization. The majority of the BLA who accepted consolidation formed a completely separate group&quot; referred to as the Black Liberation Army - Coordinating Committee; these members largely deferred to imprisoned leadership for strategic guidance and were &quot;involved in the factional struggle&quot; within the PG-RNA. The call to consolidate outlined the majority group&#x27;s political stance, rejecting reformism as &quot;based on unprincipled class collaboration with our enemy&quot; and asserting the following principles:
# That we are anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and anti-sexist.
# That we must of necessity strive for the abolishment of these systems and for the institution of socialistic relationships in which Black people have total and absolute control over their own destiny as a people.
# That in order to abolish our systems of oppression, we must utilize the science of class struggle, develop this science as it relates to our unique national condition.
In this 1976 statement, the BLA-CC allowed &quot;principled&quot; and &quot;tactical&quot; unity with revolutionary whites; this would guarantee that the revolutionary Black organization made determining decisions both strategically and tactically during the collaboration and guarded against whites using the BLA for their own benefit. 

A substantial number of New York Black Liberation Army members did not accept this consolidation effort, and continued to release communiques under the auspices of the BLA in general. By the 1980s, this minority grouping had formed the Revolutionary Armed Task Force, a fusion of veterans of the BLA on one hand and the Weather Underground Organization on the other. The latter were operating as the May 19th Communist Organization, a cell responsible for a series of bombings and robberies. It sought to re-energize the armed struggle in the United States and fund a retrenchment of Black nationalist revolutionary politics that had been eclipsed by the defeat of the movement in the mid-seventies. The alliance between the white anti-imperialist underground and the Black revolutionary nationalist underground caused a great deal of controversy among other groupings in the BLA and PG-RNA, amid accusations that members of the RATF were trafficking drugs and running prostitution rings, Kathy Boudin&#x27;s guilty plea and dissociation from the movement in exchange for a more lenient sentence, and unsubstantiated accusations that the RATF had been a counterinsurgent &#x27;pseudo-gang&#x27; directed by US intelligence.

According to a Justice Department report on BLA activity, the Black Liberation Army was suspected of involvement in over 70 incidents of violence between 1970 and 1976. The Fraternal Order of Police blamed the BLA for the murders of 13 police officers.

On October 22, 1970, the BLA was believed to have planted a bomb in St. Brendan&#x27;s Church in San Francisco while it was full of mourners attending the funeral of San Francisco police officer Harold Hamilton, who had been killed in the line of duty while responding to a bank robbery. The bomb was detonated, but no one in the church suffered serious injuries.On May 21, 1971, as many as five men participated in the murder of two New York City police officers, Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones. Those arrested and brought to trial for the shootings include Anthony Bottom (a.k.a. Jalil Muntaqim), Albert Washington, Francisco Torres, Gabriel Torres, and Herman Bell.

On August 29, 1971, three armed men murdered 51-year-old San Francisco police sergeant John Victor Young while he was working at a desk in his police station, which was almost empty at the time due to a bombing attack on a bank that took place earlier – only one other officer and a civilian clerk were there. Two days later, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; received a letter signed by the BLA claiming responsibility for the attack.

On November 3, 1971, Officer James R. Greene of the Atlanta Police Department was shot and killed in his patrol van at a gas station. His wallet, badge, and weapon were taken, and the evidence at the scene pointed to two suspects. The first was Twymon Myers (suspected to be one of the group&#x27;s leaders), who was killed in a police shootout in 1973, and the second was Freddie Hilton (a.k.a. Kamau Sadiki), who evaded capture until 2002, when he was arrested in New York City on a separate charge and was recognized as one of the men wanted in the Greene murder. Apparently, the two men had attacked the officer to gain standing with their compatriots within Black Liberation Army.

On January 27, 1972, the Black Liberation Army assassinated police officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie at the corner of 174 Avenue B in New York City. After the killings, a note sent to authorities portrayed the murders as a retaliation for the prisoner deaths during the 1971 Attica Prison riot. Two suspects died in &quot;unrelated shootouts with cops — one in New York, and one in St. Louis, with Laurie&#x27;s gun in his car&quot; and a third was sentenced in 2016 to 21 years for selling heroin to undercover police. Another suspect, Henry Brown, was tried for the murders and found not guilty. Evidence found at the scene has since been lost.

===1972–79: Actions and flights===

On July 31, 1972, five armed individuals hijacked Delta Air Lines Flight 841 en route from Detroit to Miami, eventually collecting a ransom of $1 million and diverting the plane, after passengers were released, to Algeria. The authorities there seized the ransom but allowed the group to flee. Four were eventually caught by French authorities in Paris, where they were convicted of various crimes, but one—George Wright—remained a fugitive until September 26, 2011, when he was captured in Portugal. Portuguese courts rejected the initial pledge for extradition. American authorities may still appeal this decision.

In another high-profile incident, Assata Shakur, Zayd Shakur and Sundiata Acoli were said to have opened fire on state troopers in New Jersey after being pulled over for a broken taillight. Zayd Shakur and state trooper Werner Foerster were both killed during the exchange; Assata Shakur was shot in the back and the arm. Following her capture, Assata Shakur was tried in six different criminal trials. According to Shakur, she was beaten and tortured during her incarceration in a number of different federal and state prisons. The charges against them ranged from kidnapping to assault and battery to bank robbery. Assata Shakur was found guilty by an all-white jury of the murder of both Foerster and her companion Zayd Shakur, but escaped prison in 1979. Shakur eventually fled to Cuba and received political asylum there. Acoli was convicted of killing Foerster and sentenced to life in prison.

===1981: Brinks robbery===

The BLA was active in the US until at least 1981 when a Brink&#x27;s truck robbery, conducted with support from former Weather Underground members Kathy Boudin, David Gilbert and Judith Alice Clark, left a guard and two police officers dead. Boudin, Gilbert and Clark along with several BLA and May 19th Communist Organization members, were subsequently arrested.

==Aftermath==
===Anarchist sympathies===

Following the collapse of the BLA, some members — including Ashanti Alston, Donald Weems (a.k.a. Kuwasi Balagoon), and Ojore Lutalo — became outspoken proponents of anarchism. Weems died in prison of an AIDS-related disease in 1986. Alston remains active in prison support and other activist circles. Lutalo was released from prison in 2009 after serving 28 years on charges related to a shootout with a drug dealer in 1981 (and parole violation stemming from his conviction for a 1975 bank robbery), during which time he was punished with solitary confinement for receiving anarchist literature. While incarcerated, the Anarchist Black Cross Federation gave him support.

On January 26, 2010, Lutalo was arrested for endangering public transportation while on an Amtrak train to New Jersey, after attending the Anarchist Book Fair in Los Angeles, being mistakenly identified as making terrorist threats on his cell phone. The charge was dropped for lack of evidence, and Lutalo settled a suit against the city of La Junta, Colorado, where his arrest was made, for an undisclosed amount.

===Later trials===

In January 2007, eight men, labelled the San Francisco 8, were charged by a joint state and federal task force with John Young&#x27;s murder. The defendants have been identified as former members of the Black Liberation Army. A similar case was dismissed in 1975 when a judge ruled that police gathered evidence through the use of torture. On June 29, 2009, Herman Bell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Sgt. Young. In July 2009, charges were dropped against four of the accused: Ray Boudreaux, Henry W. Jones, Richard Brown and Harold Taylor. That same month, Jalil Muntaquim pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter, becoming the second person to be convicted in this case.

=== Legacy ===
Black Liberation Army members were cited as an influence by founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. 

Ex-BLA member and fugitive Assata Shakur is considered &quot;a hero to many US left-wing activists.&quot; She is celebrated by some groups, including the organizers of the 2017 Women&#x27;s March, and Black power group Assata&#x27;s Daughters.

<text>James Webb Cook Hayes (March 20, 1856 – July 26, 1934) was an American businessman and soldier. He co-founded a forerunner of Union Carbide, served in three wars, and received the Medal of Honor.

==Early years and family==
James Webb Cook Hayes was the second son of President Rutherford B. Hayes and Lucy Webb Hayes. 

With his father serving in the American Civil War from the time James was five years old, he spent six months every winter at his father&#x27;s encampment, which was usually Camp White, West Virginia. He became very close with the commander of the unit, General George Crook, who later became his godfather. Crook taught him how to live off the land, including hunting, fishing and survival. Years later, after Crook became famous in the west as a hunter and Indian fighter, the two made annual trips into the Rocky Mountains for a hunt of big game.

==College and career==
Hayes attended Cornell University from 1873 to 1875 and was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He left Cornell to work as his father&#x27;s secretary when his father was the governor of Ohio. When his father was elected president, he again served as his father&#x27;s secretary. 

In 1881, Hayes moved to Cleveland to work as the treasurer of the Whipple Manufacturing Company. In 1887, he, with three others, founded the National Carbon Company, which is now known as Union Carbide. Hayes stayed with this company for many years as the vice president. 

He was the principal proponent for founding the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, the first presidential library. It was established in 1916 at Spiegel Grove.

Hayes died on July 26, 1934, in Marion, Ohio, and was buried with his parents at Spiegel Grove, the family estate in Fremont, Ohio.

==Military service==
Hayes also served in the military in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War and First World War. He was a member of the First Cleveland Troop, later known as Troop A of the Ohio National Guard. During the Spanish–American War, he was appointed a major in the First Ohio Cavalry. He fought in Santiago de Cuba Campaign, during which he was wounded during the crossing of the San Juan River and the assault on San Juan Hill, and later in the invasion of Puerto Rico. 

Following this, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, reassigned to the 31st United States Volunteer Infantry, and sent to the Philippines. Just hours after landing there, he led a rescue party to free captured men at Vigan Island. He received the Medal of Honor for this action. He went on to participate in the China Relief Expedition during the Boxer Rebellion and as an observer in the Russo-Japanese War. 

During World War I, Hayes was promoted to colonel and first served as a special agent for the State Department in France and later held an administrative assignment on the Italian front. After the war he was promoted to brigadier general.

Hayes was a member of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of the service of his uncle, Lieutenant Colonel J.T. Webb, as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was also a member of the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

==Medal of Honor citation==

<doc id="765310" wikidata="Q1592282" url="?curid=765310" title="Head of State (2003 film)">
<text>Head of State is a 2003 American political comedy film directed, written by, produced by and starring Chris Rock and co-starring Bernie Mac. It marked the directorial debut of Rock, who had previously worked as a writer, producer, and actor.

The plot follows a minor politician who unexpectedly becomes the President of the United States. The title refers to one of the President&#x27;s functions as the American head of state.

Critical reviews were mixed to negative, and the film was a box office disappointment. This was the last film by cinematographer Donald E. Thorin.

==Plot==
Mays Gilliam is the alderman for the 9th Ward in Washington, D.C. After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is unexpectedly chosen as the Democratic Party candidate for the 2004 presidential election after his party&#x27;s original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to incumbent Republican vice-president Brian Lewis, the Democrats decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the 2008 presidential election.

At first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as president because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to damage his reputation. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother Mitch persuades him to speak out for what he believes in. He ditches the bland, boring, and uncontroversial speeches prepared for him and begins to talk honestly about major issues such as welfare, healthcare, income inequality, and society overall. Mays even finds time to romance Lisa Clark, a gas station attendant he crosses paths with, and who has been a huge supporter of Mays.

After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was &quot;kissing&quot; his opponent (taken from Bugs Bunny–Elmer Fudd cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls.

As election day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (despite them having reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the presidency, and proposes to Lisa by saying he wants to make her his First Lady.

==Production==
Rock said in &quot;HBO First Look&quot; that he got the idea from the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who chose Geraldine Ferraro—a woman—as his running mate. The Democrats knew they had little chance of defeating Ronald Reagan, but selected Ferraro in hopes of gaining female support.

The ceremonial first pitch scene was filmed prior to a Baltimore Orioles–Toronto Blue Jays game at Camden Yards on August 24, 2002.

Boston comedian and actor Jimmy Tingle has the role of a talk show host, in which he interviews Bernie Mac’s character Mitch.

Part of the presidential debate is a verbatim repeat of Monty Python&#x27;s Argument Clinic.

In one scene, Gilliam quotes &quot;The Roof Is on Fire&quot; by Rock Master Scott &amp; the Dynamic Three.

According to the DVD audio commentary, the scene where Gilliam sings &quot;Deep in the Heart of Texas&quot; is a reference to &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, where Pee-Wee Herman does the same thing.

==Reception==
&quot;Head of State&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film maintains a score of 30% approval rating from 120 critics, with the critical consensus reading, &quot;&quot;Head of State&quot; squanders its potentially ripe premise with watered-down satire and formulaic gags.&quot; On Metacritic, the film maintains a score of 44/100, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert, writing for &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave the film 3/4 stars, writing that it&#x27;s &quot;an imperfect movie, but not a boring one and not lacking in intelligence.&quot;

<text>In computing, CHILL (an acronym for [[ITU-T|CCITT]] [[High Level Language]]) is a procedural programming language designed for use in telecommunication switches (the hardware used inside telephone exchanges). The language is still used for legacy systems in some telecommunication companies and for signal box programming.

The CHILL language is similar in size and complexity to the original Ada language. The first specification of the CHILL language was published in 1980, a few years before Ada.

ITU provides a standard CHILL compiler.
A free CHILL compiler was bundled with GCC up to version 2.95, however, was removed from later versions. An object-oriented version, called Object CHILL, was developed also.

ITU is responsible for the CHILL standard, known as ITU-T Rec. Z.200. The equivalent ISO standard is ISO/IEC 9496:2003. (The text of the two documents is the same). In late 1999 CCITT stopped maintaining the CHILL standard.

CHILL was used in systems of Alcatel System 12 and Siemens EWSD, for example.

<text>The English Bill was drafted on April 23, 1858, it was an offer made by the United States Congress to Kansas Territory. Kansas was offered some millions of acres of public lands in exchange for accepting the Lecompton Constitution.

The English Bill was introduced by William Hayden English (1822–1896), a Democratic representative in Congress from 1853 to 1861. The bill itself was not a bribe to the degree that it is usually considered to be, as it reduced the grant of land demanded by the Lecompton Ordinance from 23,500,000 to 3,500,000 acres (95,000 to 14,000 km2), and offered only the normal cession to new states. This grant, however, was conditioned on the acceptance of the Lecompton Constitution, and Congress made no promise of any grant if that Constitution were not adopted.

On August 21, 1858, by a vote of 11,812 to 1,926, Kansans rejected the offer.

<text>USS &quot;Laboon&quot; (DDG-58) is the eighth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy.
She is named for Father John Francis Laboon (1921–1988), a captain in the Chaplain Corps of the United States Navy, who was awarded the Silver Star during World War II while serving on the submarine .

&quot;Laboon&quot; keel was laid down in 1992 at the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Bath, Maine. She was launched in 1993, and commissioned in 1995.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
&quot;Laboon&quot; keel was laid down on 23 March 1992 at the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Bath, Maine. She was launched on 20 February 1993. &quot;Laboon&quot; was commissioned on 18 March 1995.

In late 1996, she fired Tomahawk missiles at targets in Iraq, thus becoming the first &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer to engage in combat.

In 1998, &quot;Laboon&quot; took part in NATO Exercise Dynamic Response 98, together with &#x27;s Amphibious Ready Group.

On 12 September 2012, &quot;Laboon&quot; was ordered to the coast of Libya in what the Pentagon called a &quot;contingency&quot; in case a strike was ordered. This was in response to the 2012 diplomatic missions attacks.

On 21 June 2015, &quot;Laboon&quot; entered the Black Sea along with the French ship as part of NATO&#x27;s presence missions following the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. While in the Black Sea, &quot;Laboon&quot; participated in joint maneuvers with a Romanian Navy for two days beginning on 22 June 2015. On 27 June 2015, &quot;Laboon&quot; began a two-day visit to the Black Sea port of Batumi, Georgia, to participate in training with the Coast Guard of Georgia and offer tours of the ship.

On 14 April 2018, she fired seven Tomahawk missiles from a position in the Red Sea as part of a bombing campaign in retaliation for the Syrian government&#x27;s use of chemical weapons against people in Douma.

===2023 Israel-Hamas war===
On 14 October 2023, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed and her carrier strike group, which includes the cruiser , along with &quot;Laboon&quot;, and sister-destroyers and , to the eastern Mediterranean in response to Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas. This was the second carrier strike group to be sent to the region in response to the conflict, following and her group, which was dispatched only six days earlier.

On 23 December 2023, while patrolling in the southern Red Sea, &quot;Laboon&quot; shot down four unmanned aerial attack drones that originated from areas controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and were inbound toward &quot;Laboon&quot;. On 26 December, &quot;Laboon&quot; shot down three anti-ship ballistic missiles in the Red Sea fired by Houthi rebels with multiple SM-6 missiles. This was the first intercept of a ballistic missile in combat.

On 6 January 2024, &quot;Laboon&quot; shot down a Houthi drone in the Red Sea. On 9 January, at approximately 9:15 p.m. (Sanaa time), Iranian-backed Houthis launched a complex attack of Iranian designed one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles (OWA UAVs), anti-ship cruise missiles, and an anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Southern Red Sea, towards international shipping lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting. Eighteen OWA UAVs, two anti-ship cruise missiles, and one anti-ship ballistic missile were shot down by a combined effort of F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft from &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, &quot;Gravely&quot;, &quot;Laboon&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot;, and the United Kingdom’s . This was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since 19 November 2023. There were no injuries or damage reported. On 14 January, an anti-ship missile was fired in the direction of &quot;Laboon&quot; from a Houthi-controlled portion of Yemen, according to CENTCOM.

On 2 February 2024, &quot;Laboon&quot; and F/A-18 Super Hornets from &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; shot down at least 12 drones launched by Houthis over the Red Sea. On 6 February at 4:30 p.m., while patrolling in the Gulf of Aden, &quot;Laboon&quot;, operating near the cargo ship MV &quot;Star Nasia&quot;, intercepted and shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Iranian-backed Houthis. On 20 February at 12:30 a.m., while operating in the Gulf of Aden, &quot;Laboon&quot; detected and shot down one anti-ship cruise missile fired by the Houthis.

<text>The Bani River is the principal tributary of the Niger River in Mali. The river is formed from the confluence of the Baoulé and Bagoé rivers some east of Bamako and it merges with the Niger near Mopti. Its length is about .

==Geography==
The Bani River has three main tributaries: the Baoulé that rises near Odienné in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and passes just south of Bougouni, the Bagoé River that rises near Boundiali in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and the Banifing-Lotio that drains the region around Sikasso. The drainage basin upstream of Douna has an area of , 85% of which lies in southern Mali and 15% in northern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

The annual rainfall varies across the catchment basin with the southern area in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire receiving a year while the northern area around Douna receiving only . For the period 1965-1995 the average annual rainfall for the basin was . The rainfall is seasonal with most of the rain falling between May and October. The maximum rainfall occurs in August.

The discharge of the Bani River is also highly seasonal, with the maximum flow occurring at the end of September and very little flow between
February and June. The river enters the Inland Niger Delta north of San and after the annual rains the river floods (the French word &quot;crue&quot; is sometimes used) and covers the floodplain.

There is a significant inter-annual variation in the rainfall and, as a consequence, in the quantity of water flowing in the river. The drought that started at the beginning of the 1970s led to a very large reduction in the flow and up to the present time the volumes are still much lower than those observed in the 1950s and 1960s. The reduction in the flow of the river was much greater than the reduction in the rainfall. The average rainfall for 1981-1989 was 20% less than for 1961-1970 while the discharge of the river was reduced by 75%. The effect of the reduced rainfall was less extreme for other tributaries of the Niger. Over the same period the catchment basin of the Upper Niger suffered a similar 20% reduction in rainfall but the readings at the Koulikoro gauge station were only reduced to 50% of the earlier values. Because of the accumulated groundwater deficit, even in a year with high rainfall, the discharge of the Bani River is less than in the wet decades of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Talo Dam==
In 2006 the Talo Dam was constructed to irrigate parts of the floodplain to the south of the river near the town of San. Prior to the construction of the dam, these areas were only fully flooded in very wet years, the most recent of which occurred in 1967. The dam is located west of San, downstream of Douna and upstream of Djenné. The dam acts as a weir in that water can flow over the top of the retaining wall. The construction of the dam was highly controversial. The environmental impact assessment commissioned by the African Development Bank was criticised for not fully taking into account the hydrological impact downstream of the dam.

The retaining wall is high and in length, creating a reservoir with a capacity to retain of water. This volume represents 1.3% of the average annual discharge of the river (over the period 1952-2002 the average discharge was . A downstream flow of /s can be maintained during the dry season by opening a sluice gate. From the published information it is unclear how much of the total discharge will be diverted for irrigation and, of the diverted water, how much will drain back into the river. The downstream effect of the dam will be to delay the arrival of the annual flood and to reduce its intensity.

==Djenné Dam==
In May 2009 the African Development Bank approved funding for an irrigation dam/weir to be built on the Bani near Soala, a village situated south of Djenné. The dam is one element in a 6-year 66 million USD program that also includes the building of a dam on the Sankarani River near Kourouba and the extension of the area irrigated by the Talo dam. The proposed Djenné dam will retain of water, significantly more than the Talo dam. It will allow the &quot;controlled flooding&quot; of 14,000 ha of the Pondori floodplain (on the left bank of the river to the south of Djenné) to allow the cultivation of rice and the irrigation of an additional 5000 ha for growing &#x27;floating grass&#x27; (&quot;Echinochloa stagnina&quot; know locally as &quot;bourgou&quot;) for animal feed.

The effects of the dams on the flooding of the Inland Niger Delta downstream of Mopti are expected to be modest, as the discharge of the Bani is only one third of that of the Niger: for the period 1952-2002 the average flow at Douna was /s compared with /s for the Niger at Koulikoro.

<text>Sir Henry Spelman (c. 1562 – October 1641) was an English antiquary, noted for his detailed collections of medieval records, in particular of church councils.

==Life==
Spelman was born in Congham, Norfolk, the eldest son of Henry Spelman (d. 1581), of Congham, and the grandson of Sir John Spelman (1495–1544). He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1583.

He sat in parliament as a member for Castle Rising in Norfolk in 1593 and 1597–98. Knighted in 1603, he was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1604. In 1612, he settled in London near his friend Sir Robert Bruce Cotton. In 1617, he served on a commission to inquire into disputed Irish estates, and later took part into legal inquiries into the exactions levied on behalf of the Crown in the civil and ecclesiastical courts. Henry Spelman continued to rise in prestige served as a member of the Parliament of England for Worcester in 1625. In 1627, he became treasurer of the Guiana Company, and he was also an energetic member of the council for New England. His general services to the state were recognized in 1636 by a gift of money and two years later by the offer of the mastership of Sutton&#x27;s Hospital, Charterhouse.

He died in London in October 1641, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Personal life==
He married Eleanor, daughter of John Lestrange, of Sedgeford in Norfolk, on 28 April 1590.

His nephew, also named Henry Spelman, became a notable translator in America.

His later years were spent in the house of his son-in-law, Sir Ralph Whitfield. He was survived by his sons, John Spelman, Judge Clement Spillman, and a daughter, Catherine, who married a Secretary of State.

==Works==
His works include &quot;Concilia Ecclesiastica Orbis Britannici&quot; (1639) (a work containing many forgeries) and &quot;Glossarium Archaiologicum&quot; (completed by William Dugdale). His &quot;Reliquiae Spelmannianae&quot; was edited by Edmund Gibson in 1698.

Sir Henry has become known as master of the sacrilege narrative (the idea that divine retribution was visited on those who despoiled the monasteries of their estates during the English Reformation), not least through his experimental examination of the genealogies of all the landed families within a twenty-four mile radius of his Norfolk home.

<text>William Hayden English (August 27, 1822 – February 7, 1896) was an American politician. He served as a U.S. Representative from Indiana from 1853 to 1861 and was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1880.

English retired from the House in 1861, but remained involved in party affairs. In the American Civil War he was a War Democrat, supporting the Union war effort. As well as pursuing a political career, he was an author and businessman. He owned an opera house, was president of a bank, and developed many residential properties. English was successful in business, and became one of the wealthiest men in Indiana. After nearly two decades in the private sector, English returned to political life as the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1880. English and his presidential running mate, Winfield Scott Hancock, lost narrowly to their Republican opponents, James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur.

==Family and early career==
William Hayden English was born August 27, 1822 in Lexington, Indiana, the only son of Elisha Gale English and his wife, Mahala (Eastin) English. Both his parents were Kentucky natives from slaveholding families of English and French Huguenot ancestry. They moved to southern Indiana in 1818. Elisha English quickly became involved in local politics as a Democrat, serving in the state legislature as well as building a prominent business career. William English was educated in the local public schools, later attending Hanover College. He left college after three years and began to read law. In 1840, English was admitted to the bar at the age of eighteen and soon built a practice in his native Scott County. He started early in politics as well, attending the state Democratic convention that same year and giving speeches on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren.

From the end of 1842, English was mentored by Lieutenant Governor Jesse D. Bright, who helped him rise within Bright&#x27;s faction of the party. The following year, the Indiana House of Representatives selected English as their clerk. In 1844, he worked the campaign trail, this time in the service of presidential candidate James K. Polk.

==Politics and marriage==
As a reward, after Polk took office in 1845, he granted English a patronage appointment as a clerk in the federal Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. English held this position for four years, during which time he met Emma Mardulia Jackson. They married in November 1847. They had two children: William Eastin and Rosalind.

English attended the 1848 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, where he supported Lewis Cass, the eventual presidential nominee. With the election of the Whig Party&#x27;s candidate, Zachary Taylor, to the presidency, a Whig party member replaced English at the Treasury Department. He secured a job as clerk to the United States Senate&#x27;s Claims Committee through party connections; serving until 1850 in Washington.

English and his wife then returned to Indiana, where he worked as secretary to the Indiana constitutional convention. Democrats were in the majority at the convention, and their proposals were incorporated into the new law, including increasing the number of elective offices, guaranteeing a homestead exemption, and restricting voting rights to white men. Free blacks had formerly had suffrage in the state. The voters approved the new constitution by a large majority.

In August 1851, English won his first election to the state House of Representatives. As it was the first meeting of the legislature under the 1851 constitution, English&#x27;s knowledge of it contributed to his election as speaker of the House at the age of twenty-nine. The House had a Democratic majority and, at Bright&#x27;s direction, English worked for the election of Graham N. Fitch, a member of Bright&#x27;s faction of the party, to the U.S. Senate. The legislature chose a different Democrat, John Pettit, instead. Holding the office of Speaker increased English&#x27;s influence throughout the state; in 1852, the Democrats chose him as their nominee for the federal House of Representatives from the newly reconfigured 2nd district. The Democrats were victorious in the election that October, sweeping all but one House seat. English defeated his Whig opponent 55% – 45% and joined the 33rd Congress when it convened in Washington in 1853.

English&#x27;s time in Congress, much like the rest of his political career, can be seen as pragmatic. While he morally abhorred slavery, he condemned abolitionists and believed in the notion of &quot;popular sovereignty,&quot; which argued that the people of a state or territory should choose for themselves whether to have slavery. He explained his opinion in a speech in 1854:

==Congress==

===Kansas–Nebraska Act===
The House of Representatives convened for the 33rd Congress in December 1853. At that time, the simmering disagreement between the free and slave states heated up with the introduction of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, proposed by Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, which would open the Kansas and Nebraska territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas&#x27;s proposal instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery&#x27;s expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. English, a member of the Committee on Territories, thought the bill was unnecessary and disagreed with its timing; when the committee approved the bill, English wrote a minority report to that effect. He was not altogether opposed to the principle of popular sovereignty, however, believing that &quot;each organized community ought to be allowed to decide for itself&quot;. Northern Democrats divided almost evenly on the bill, but English, despite his stated reservations, was among those who voted for it. In doing so, he said that Congress was bound to respect the decision of the territories&#x27; residents and pledged to uphold their decisions. President Franklin Pierce signed the bill into law on May 30, 1854.

 The Kansas–Nebraska Act was grossly unpopular across the North. The reaction ultimately killed the Whig Party, weakened northern Democrats, and brought about a new party, the Republicans. Only 3 of 42 free-state representatives were reelected after voting for it; English was one of them. English was a conservative Democrat, and his southern Indiana district, while not pro-slavery, also had little sympathy for abolitionism. He was reelected again in 1856, when the Democrats regained the House majority in the 35th Congress. The Speaker, James Lawrence Orr, assigned English to the Post Office and Post Roads Committee, but the issue of Kansas claimed more of his time.

===English Bill===

In December 1857, in an election boycotted by free-state partisans, Kansas adopted the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and petitioned Congress to be admitted as a slave state. President James Buchanan, a Democrat, urged that Congress take up the matter, and the Senate approved a bill to admit Kansas. The bill was defeated in the House, 112–120. English found the process by which the pro-slavery Kansans forced through their constitution inadequate, and voted against admission. Congress continued to debate the matter for months without resolution. English and Georgia Democrat Alexander H. Stephens came up with a compromise measure, later called the English Bill. The English Bill offered Kansas admission as a slave state, but only if the people endorsed that choice in a referendum. The Bill also required Kansans to renounce the unusually large grant of federal lands they had requested in the Lecompton Constitution. The Kansas voters could, thus, reject Lecompton by the face-saving measure of turning down the smaller land grant. Congress passed the English Bill, and Kansans duly rejected their pro-slavery constitution by a ratio of six to one. Some of English&#x27;s political allies, including Bright (now a senator), would have preferred that Kansas be admitted as a slave state, but the decision was popular enough in his district to allow English to be reelected in 1858 with a majority of 56% to 44%.

==Business career==

English declined to run for reelection in 1860 but he gave several speeches advocating compromise and moderation in the growing North-South divide. After Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election that year, English urged Southerners not to secede. After southern secession occurred and the Civil War began, Governor Oliver P. Morton offered English command of a regiment, but he declined it since he had no military knowledge or interests. English, however, supported Morton&#x27;s (and indirectly Lincoln&#x27;s) war policies and considered himself a War Democrat. English lent money to the state government to cover the expenses of outfitting the troops and served as provost marshal for the 2nd congressional district.

After retiring from Congress, English spent a year at his home in Scott County before he relocated to Indianapolis, the state capital. English and ten associates (including James Lanier) organized the First National Bank of Indianapolis in 1863, the first bank in that city chartered under the new National Bank Act. He remained president of that bank until 1877, including the difficult period during the Panic of 1873, when many other banks folded.

English&#x27;s business interests included other industries as well. He became the controlling shareholder of the Indianapolis Street Railway Company and remained in charge of the company until 1876, when he sold his shares. Having also sold his shares of the bank by 1877, English turned most of his investment capital to real estate. By 1875, he had ordered construction of 75 houses along what is now English Avenue.

His wife, Emma, died two years later, in 1877. he survived her by 19 years. When he died in 1896, he owned 448 properties, most of them in Indianapolis.

In 1880, English constructed English&#x27;s Opera House, which, according to the 1994 &quot;Encyclopedia of Indianapolis&quot;, quickly became known as the city&#x27;s finest. The building was modeled after the Grand Opera House in New York and seated 2,000 people. It opened on September 27, 1880, with a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Lawrence Barrett. By that time, English was involved in politics once more. He turned over management of the Opera House to his son, William Eastin English, who was interested in the theater and had just married an actress, Annie Fox. English Sr. later added a hotel to the Opera House, and both operated until 1948.

==Vice-presidential candidate==
After leaving the House of Representatives, English remained in touch with local politics, and served as chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party. His son had been elected to the state house in 1879, and the elder English was still consulted on political matters. Although he had not sought elected office since 1858, he had raised his national profile in 1879 through several interviews and letters to friendly newspapers. English attended the 1880 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati as a member of the Indiana delegation, where he favored presidential candidate Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, whom he admired for his support of the gold standard. The first ballot was inconclusive, with Bayard in second place. Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania led the voting, and on the second ballot was nominated for President.

The Indiana delegation held back their votes from Hancock until the crucial moment, and as a reward, the delegates unanimously selected English for the vice-presidential nomination. He was not expected to add much to the ticket outside of Indiana, but the party leaders thought his popularity in that swing state would help Hancock against James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, the Republican nominees. The Republicans believed that the real reason for English&#x27;s nomination was his willingness to use his personal fortune to finance the campaign, as Democratic campaign coffers were low. English gave a brief speech accepting the nomination, then replied more formally in a letter a month later. In that letter, English called the disputes of the Civil War settled, and promised a &quot;sound currency, of honest money&quot;, the restriction of Chinese immigration, and a &quot;rigid economy in public expenditure&quot;. He characterized the election as one between

Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, which, with the disenfranchisement of black Southerners following the end of Reconstruction, was dominated electorally by white Democrats. In addition to the South, the ticket needed to add New York and a few of the Midwestern states to their total to win the election; national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation. The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing &quot;a tariff for revenue only&quot;. Garfield&#x27;s campaign used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, who benefited from the high protective tariff then in place. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority.

The October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about the federal election to come the following month. There was even some talk among party leaders of dropping English from the ticket, but English convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November. In the end, English was proven wrong: the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Midwestern states they had targeted, including Indiana. Hancock and English lost the popular vote by just 7,018. The electoral vote, however, had a much larger spread: 214 for Garfield and Arthur, compared to 155 for Hancock and English.

==Post-election career==
English resumed his business career after the election. He also became more interested in local history, joining a reunion of the survivors of the 1850 state constitutional convention, which met at his opera house in 1885. He became the president of the Indiana Historical Society and wrote two volumes, which were published at his death: &quot;Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778–1783&quot;; and &quot;Life of General George Rogers Clark&quot;. He served on the Indianapolis Monument Commission in 1893, and helped to plan and finance the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument there.

==Death and legacy==
He died at his home in Indianapolis on February 7, 1896. English was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery with his wife, who had died in 1877. Although many of the buildings he constructed have been demolished, English, Indiana, the county seat of Crawford County, is named after him, as is English Avenue in Indianapolis. Identical statues of English stand in front of the Scott County Courthouse in Scottsburg, Indiana, and at the Crawford County Fairgrounds in English. His son William served in Congress from 1884 to 1885. His grandson, William English Walling, the son of his daughter Rosalind, was a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. An extensive collection of English&#x27;s personal and family papers is housed at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis, where it is open for research.

<text>Klax is a puzzle video game released in arcades in 1990 by Atari Games while Namco distributed the game in Japanese markets. It was designed and animated by Mark Stephen Pierce with the software engineering done by Dave Akers. The object is to catch colored blocks tumbling down a machine and arrange them in colored rows and patterns to make them disappear. &quot;Klax&quot; was originally published as a coin-op follow-up to &quot;Tetris&quot;, about which Atari Games was in a legal dispute at the time.

The Atari 2600 version, released in mid 1990, and &quot;Fatal Run&quot;, are the final releases for the console which was discontinued in early 1992.

==Gameplay==

Controls consist of a four-position joystick and a button. The player controls a small paddle at the lower end of a constantly running conveyor belt. Using the joystick, the player can move the paddle left or right to catch tiles in various colors as they advance down the conveyor. Below the paddle is a well that can hold up to 25 tiles in five columns of five; pressing the button causes the topmost tile on the paddle to fall directly downward and into the well, as long as that column is not full. The goal is to form &quot;Klaxs&quot;, or unbroken horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines containing three tiles of the same color. Doing so awards points and causes those tiles to disappear, allowing any tiles above them to fall toward the bottom of the well. Bonus points are awarded for completing multiple Klaxs with a single tile (including lines of four or five matching tiles) and for Klaxs formed by the falling of already-placed tiles.

The paddle can hold up to five tiles at any given moment. The player is penalized with one &quot;drop&quot; whenever a tile falls off the conveyor without being caught or while the paddle is full. Pushing up on the joystick will flip the topmost tile on the paddle a short distance up the conveyor, while pulling down accelerates the motion of the tiles.

The game consists of 100 waves, presented as 20 groups of five waves each. At the start of the game and after every fifth wave, the drop meter is cleared and the player is presented with three options of which wave to play next; choosing a later wave awards bonus points and allows more drops. Each wave has an objective that must be reached, such as making a set number of Klaxs, scoring a certain number of points, or surviving a set number of tiles. At the end of a wave, bonus points are awarded for each tile still on the conveyor and paddle and for each empty space in the well. 

The game ends when the player either exhausts the available drops, completely fills the well, or finishes all 100 waves.

==Development==
Akers programmed &quot;Klax&quot; in just a few weeks using AmigaBASIC, then ported each line to C. In a 1990 interview, he said he wanted to &quot;produce something playable, compact and relatively quick to develop&quot;. His influences were &quot;Tetris&quot; and tic-tac-toe. He chose the name from the sound tiles make rolling across the screen. Atari Games released &quot;Klax&quot; in February 1990, with Namco releasing the game in Japan a few months later, and soon called it a &quot;major arcade hit&quot;. It quickly released several home versions under the Tengen brand. Akers created the Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis editions. Some 16-bit conversions feature improved graphics. &quot;Klax&quot; received the Parents&#x27; Choice Foundation&#x27;s seal of approval in 1990, won Best Mind Game at the 1991 European Computer Leisure Awards, and Dennis Lynch of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named &quot;Klax&quot; the Best Cartridge of 1990.

Midway Games gained the rights to &quot;Klax&quot; upon purchasing Atari Games in 1996. The game has been re-released in retro compilations for modern consoles. A 1999 press release called it Midway&#x27;s &quot;tic-tac tile puzzle game&quot;. Mike Mika, who was working on the Game Boy Color version of the game, placed a hidden wedding proposal inside it. It took his then girlfriend three years to uncover the proposal. Mike Mika also inserted a hidden &quot;Snake&quot;-like game and a mini-adventure game as easter eggs.

After the arcade version, &quot;Klax&quot; was converted to most contemporary home computers and video game systems of the 1990s, including the Atari Lynx, Amstrad GX4000 and the Atari 2600 as its final official Atari-licensed release exclusively in Europe. The Atari 7800 version was programmed by David Dentt, who also worked on &quot;Ninja Golf&quot; for the same console. &quot;Klax&quot; is the first game with versions for all three of the leading 1990s consoles: the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Genesis, and the TurboGrafx-16. &quot;Klax&quot; was included in &quot;Arcade Party Pak&quot; for the PlayStation. It was reissued in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, a 2003 compilation for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC. It appears in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Klax&quot; in its April 1, 1990 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

On release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; awarded the PC Engine version 30 out of 40. &quot;Klax&quot; was ranked the 26th best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot; in 1991. The NES version is ranked 44 in &quot;IGN&quot;″s Top 100 NES Games. 

In a capsule review of the Lynx version for &quot;STart&quot;, Clayton Walnum commended the game in aspects of gameplay, graphics, music, sound effects and speech. Julian Rignall reviewed the Atari Lynx version for &quot;CVG Magazine&quot; in January 1991, saying &quot;the game is simple, but very, very addictive&quot; and giving a rating of 93 out of 100.

<text>USS &quot;Stethem&quot; (DDG-63) is the thirteenth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. The ship was built in Pascagoula, Mississippi, starting on 11 May 1993. She was commissioned on 21 October 1995. She is part of the Pacific Fleet, assigned to Destroyer Squadron 9. The &quot;Stethem&quot; was named for Steelworker 2nd Class Robert Stethem. He was a Seabee diver killed by Shiite hijackers onboard TWA 847 at Beirut International Airport in 1985.

==Ship history==
&quot;Stethem&quot; is the 13th &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class Aegis destroyer. Construction of &quot;Stethem&quot; began on 18 May 1992 with the ship&#x27;s keel being laid down at the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 11 May 1993. She was launched on 17 June 1994 and was christened on 16 July 1994 by Mrs. Patricia L. Stethem, the mother of the ship&#x27;s namesake. The vessel then transited the Panama Canal and was officially commissioned on 21 October 1995 at the Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme. On 15 February 1996 she successfully completed her Post Delivery Test and Trials and was thus cleared for combat operations.

===1996: Rescue mission===
On 23 November 1996 the ship was diverted for a Search and Rescue mission to recover survivors from a downed U.S. Air Force C-130 off the coast of northern California. In the company of two smaller boats &quot;Stethem&quot; patrolled the area around the crash for some twenty hours while engaged in recovery efforts, which earned the destroyer the U.S. Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal. She was additionally recognized for her achievements during her first year of service by earning the 1996 Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One Battle Efficiency Award.

===1997: First deployment===
On 4 April 1997 &quot;Stethem&quot; set sail for the Persian Gulf on her maiden overseas deployment, reporting for duty in Bahrain on 3 July. During the next three months she served in a variety of roles including the primary Air Warfare Commander, Surface Warfare Commander, Ready Strike Platform, and LINK Coordinator. She also provided support to both the and the Carrier Battle Groups (CBG) and several U.S. Air Force aircraft engaged in Operation Southern Watch. She also supported the United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq by conducting some 54 boardings and inspections of suspected sanctions violators.

&quot;Stethem&quot;″s port visits during her deployment included Singapore, Malaysia, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Perth and Sydney. She finally returned to San Diego on 7 November 1997 to begin an inter-deployment training cycle, the second one undertaken by the ship.

Beginning with a Command Assessment of Readiness for Training (CART II) in May 1998, &quot;Stethem&quot;″s crew trained in combat systems, navigation, engineering, mobility, damage control, and logistics management. 

===1999: Second deployment===
&quot;Stethem&quot; began her second deployment to the Persian Gulf 16 April 1999, sailing as part of the Middle East Force 99-2. After port visits to Guam, Saipan, Singapore, and Thailand, she reported for duty in the Persian Gulf conducting freedom of navigation operations and maritime interception operations. During her 76 days on station she served as an Air Warfare Commander, a Ready Strike Platform, and a Force Over-The-Horizon Track Coordinator. &quot;Stethem&quot; also had the opportunity to support the CBG as a carrier escort and a plane guard. After serving as command ship for Northern Persian Gulf Maritime Interception Operations for a second time, she transited the Strait of Hormuz on 13 August, and arrived home in San Diego 4 October 1999.

In January 2000, &quot;Stethem&quot; was honored for her achievements and was once more awarded with the 1999 Destroyer Squadron Twenty-One Battle Efficiency Award. She was the recipient of the Raytheon CIWS Award, the Pacific Force Retention Award, and the Safety Award.

In mid-September 2000, during a port visit in San Francisco, &quot;Stethem&quot; was called out to sea by the Joint Interagency Task Force West to escort the fishing vessel &quot;Gran Tauro&quot; to San Diego. &quot;Gran Tauro&quot; had been caught with over five metric tons of uncut cocaine aboard, with a total net worth of over $500 million. After completing this escort the ship returned to conducting final preparations for her next deployment.

===2001: Third deployment===
On 13 January 2001 she departed on her third deployment to the Persian Gulf, this time as part of MEF 01-1. After port visits to Hawaii, Guam, Oman, Darwin and Cairns, Australia, American Samoa, Singapore, and Thailand, &quot;Stethem&quot; reported to the United States Fifth Fleet on 28 February 2001. During her 68 days on station in the Persian Gulf she conducted maritime interception operations, served as the Air Warfare Commander, supported Operation Southern Watch, served as a Ready Strike Platform, and participated in two international naval exercises; Exercise Arabian Gauntlet and Exercise Neon Falcon. During her maritime interception operations &quot;Stethem&quot; successfully intercepted the motor vessel &quot;Diamond&quot;, which resulted in the third largest arrest of an oil-smuggling sanctions violator since the Persian Gulf War. &quot;Stethem&quot; also escorted the aircraft carrier through the Strait of Hormuz on 27 April before departing for the United States. The ship arrived home in San Diego on 28 June 2001.

====9/11 and maintenance====
After a Post-Overseas Movement Stand-down, &quot;Stethem&quot; supported the aircraft carrier and her Carrier Battle Group as an opposing force during their final battle problem. In early September she went through U.S. Navy Board of Inspection and Survey inspections (INSURV). She was conducting her INSURV on 11 September 2001 when terrorists attacked New York City and Washington, D.C., and shortly thereafter, &quot;Stethem&quot; was called into station in support of Operation Noble Eagle and tasked with conducting air surveillance of the approaches to San Diego and providing air defense coverage to shipping.

On 30 September 2001, &quot;Stethem&quot; entered into drydock for her third Selective Restricted Availability (SRA) at the Southwest Marine and Continental Maritime shipyards in San Diego. The purpose of this nine-week availability was the installation of equipment enhancements and quality of life upgrades. &quot;Stethem&quot; was also selected for the testing of the Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS). She departed drydock on 30 October 2001, and was again moved to the Continental Maritime Shipyard in San Diego. Her return to Naval Station San Diego on 6 December 2001 marked the end of the 9.4 million dollar refurbishment and refitting period. The destroyer got underway the following week to begin the work up for her next deployment, and on 14 December, she began her holiday leave and stand down period.

===2002: Fourth deployment and periodic training===
The crew assembled in mid-January 2002 to continue efforts in support of her Inter-Deployment Training Cycle (IDTC) and Tactical Tomahawk testing. In early February, &quot;Stethem&quot; anchored off the coast of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; this was the first foreign port visit by any U.S. naval combatant since the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001.

In the ensuing months &quot;Stethem&quot; embarked on her third Inter-Deployment Training Cycle and served as Command Destroyer, Squadron 23&#x27;s flagship throughout the month of February. In March, &quot;Stethem&quot; completed the Command Assessment of Readiness for Training II (CART II). Between the weeks of 1 April and 3 May 2002, &quot;Stethem&quot; completed the Tailored Ship&#x27;s Training Availability period. On 6 May &quot;Stethem&quot; served as the opposition forces for the Carrier Battle Group&#x27;s Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX).

In early June 2002, &quot;Stethem&quot; earned her seventh Engineering Command excellence award as a result of her performance during the Engineering Underway Demonstration. Starting 8 July, she commenced a five-day supply management assessment which was upgraded to an inspection because of her exemplary combat logistics readiness. Returning to the site of her commissioning at the end of July, &quot;Stethem&quot; took part in the 60th Anniversary of Seabee Days in Port Hueneme, California, in honor of her namesake. She then transited to Everett, Washington, embarked families and friends for the short transit to participate in the Seattle Seafair festival. On 12 September 2002, &quot;Stethem&quot; was chosen to lead the Parade of Sail into San Diego Bay. In the beginning of October, &quot;Stethem&quot; docked at Broadway Pier as part of San Diego&#x27;s Fleet Week celebration. While at Broadway Pier, &quot;Stethem&quot; hosted the first public Navy ship tours in San Diego since the 11 September attacks. Soon afterward, on 16 October, &quot;Stethem&quot; successfully launched the first Tomahawk Cruise Missile using the new Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS). At the end of October, &quot;Stethem&quot; once again played the role of opposition force, this time for the CBG.

In January 2003, &quot;Stethem&quot; played the opposition force role for the CBG. On 5 February 2003, &quot;Stethem&quot; returned to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, for another port visit. Working with the San Diego and Puerto Vallarta Navy League Chapters, &quot;Stethem&quot; delivered medical equipment for distribution to handicapped residents of Puerto Vallarta. The crew also painted the local library frequented by many of Puerto Vallarta&#x27;s school children. On 5 April 2003, &quot;Stethem&quot; successfully performed the first ever surface ship launch of a Block IV Tactical Tomahawk cruise missile, bringing it one step closer to fleet introduction. This was followed up on 8 May with the first surface ship launch of a Block IV Tactical Tomahawk cruise missile with a live warhead. After the missile left the launcher, &quot;Stethem&quot;″s strike team became the first to demonstrate Tactical Tomahawk&#x27;s post launch execution capability when they redirected the missile in flight. Both the team and the missile performed without error, destroying the intended target on San Clemente Island after over 2 hours and 700 miles of missile flight.
On 14 May 2003, after a two-week intermediate maintenance availability, &quot;Stethem&quot; sailed in support of a different kind of missile-firing exercise. During this exercise &quot;Stethem&quot;″s air warfare team engaged two airborne targets with Standard Missiles. After this successful engagement, &quot;Stethem&quot; celebrated by transiting north to make post calls at Juneau, Alaska and Victoria, British Columbia.

Returning from her trek up North in June, &quot;Stethem&quot; rested for one week and then put back to sea to serve as the opposition force against Pacific Fleet&#x27;s first Expeditionary Strike Group, which was headed up by amphibious assault ship .
===2017: Man overboard===
On 2 July 2017, &quot;Stethem&quot; sailed within of Triton Island in the South China Sea while conducting freedom of navigation exercises. On 1 August 2017, while on routine patrol west of Subic Bay, Philippines, one of &quot;Stethem&quot;″s sailors was reported missing and presumed to have gone overboard. U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command ships were joined by ships and aircraft from the navies of China and Japan in an extensive search and rescue effort. 
On 4 August 2017, after searching for 79 hours and covering 10,000 square miles without success, the search was called off.

<doc id="765341" wikidata="Q2607610" url="?curid=765341" title="Park Slope">
<text>Park Slope is a neighborhood in South Brooklyn, New York City, within the area once known as South Brooklyn. Park Slope is roughly bounded by Prospect Park and Prospect Park West to the east, Fourth Avenue to the west, Flatbush Avenue to the north, and Prospect Expressway to the south. Generally, the neighborhood is divided into three sections from north to south: North Slope, Center Slope, and South Slope. The neighborhood takes its name from its location on the western slope of neighboring Prospect Park. Fifth Avenue and Seventh Avenue are its primary commercial streets, while its east–west side streets are lined with brownstones and apartment buildings.

Park Slope was settled by the Lenape before Europeans arrived in the 17th century. The area was mostly farms and woods until the early 19th century, when the land was subdivided into rectangular parcels. The western section of the neighborhood was occupied in the mid-19th century, being located near the industrial Gowanus Canal and ferries. After the completion of Prospect Park, numerous mansions and rowhouses were developed in Park Slope&#x27;s eastern section in the 1880s. Park Slope faced social and infrastructural decline in the mid-20th century, but the building stock was renovated after the area became gentrified starting in the 1960s. Much of the neighborhood is overlaid by the Park Slope Historic District, which is composed of a National Historic District and a New York City landmark district.

Park Slope features historic buildings, top-rated restaurants, bars, and shops, as well as proximity to Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, and the Central Library and Park Slope branches of the Brooklyn Public Library. The neighborhood had a population of about 62,200 as of the 2000 census. Park Slope is generally ranked as one of New York City&#x27;s most desirable neighborhoods.

Park Slope is part of Brooklyn Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11215 and 11217. It is patrolled by the 78th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 33rd and 39th Districts.

== History ==
===Early settlement===
Though modern-day Brooklyn is coextensive with Kings County, this was not always the case. South Brooklyn, an area in central Kings County extending to the former Brooklyn city line near Green-Wood Cemetery&#x27;s southern border, was originally settled by the Canarsee Indians, one of several indigenous Lenape peoples who farmed and hunted on the land. The Lenape typically lived in wigwams, and had larger fishing and hunting communities near freshwater sites on higher land. Several Lenape roads crossed the landscape and were later widened into &quot;ferry roads&quot; by 17th-century Dutch settlers, since they were used to provide transport to the waterfront. One was the Flatbush Road, running roughly north–south to the east of the path of present-day Flatbush Avenue. Just north of modern-day Park Slope was the Jamaica Road, running east to Jamaica, Queens, on what is now the path of Fulton Street.

The first European settlement occurred in 1637-1639 when Willem Kieft, the Dutch West India Company&#x27;s director, purchased almost all land in what is now Brooklyn and Queens. The area was used as farmland over the next two centuries.

During the American Revolutionary War, on August 27, 1776, the Park Slope area served as the backdrop for the beginning of the Battle of Long Island. In this battle, over 10,000 British soldiers and Hessian mercenaries routed outnumbered American forces, which resulted in the British occupation of Long and Staten Islands. The Battle Pass site is now preserved in Prospect Park, while on Fifth Avenue, there is a reconstruction of the Old Stone House, a farmhouse where a countercharge covered the American retreat.

=== 19th century ===

==== Early development ====
Transit from Park Slope improved in the early 19th century. The Brooklyn, Jamaica and Flatbush Turnpike Company was incorporated in 1809 to widen the Flatbush and Jamaica ferry roads, prior to the establishment of the Fulton Ferry to Manhattan in 1814. Afterward, stagecoaches started running on Flatbush Road in 1830, with omnibus service following four years later. The land comprising what is now Park Slope was still mostly undeveloped . There were a couple of houses on and around Prospect Hill, a tavern, and a resort; the section of Flatbush Road through present-day Prospect Park contained ponds of standing water, which caused fevers and other illnesses. Soon afterward, the land was split up into rectangular parcels, which were bought by numerous people and cultivated as farmland. As in the rest of Kings County, the farmland was likely dependent on slave labor.

The farm parcels were further split in the 19th century, allowing for the development of smaller urban lots. After Brooklyn was incorporated as a city in 1834, the Commissioners Plan of 1839 was devised, a street plan that extended to South Brooklyn. Park Slope was originally located in the northern section of the Eighth Ward, which at the time was the city&#x27;s least populous ward.

The Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad started running on Atlantic Avenue, north of Park Slope, in 1836. The railroad&#x27;s presence did not hasten the slow rate of residential growth in South Brooklyn because the locomotives provided slow and inefficient service. Horse-drawn railcar companies provided competition to the railroad: the first, the Brooklyn City Railroad, was founded in 1853. Other streetcar routes were founded, including a line on Flatbush Avenue in 1875, as well as the Atlantic Avenue Company&#x27;s Fifth Avenue and Ninth Avenue lines, the latter of which served the Eighth Ward directly.

==== Prospect Park and further development ====
The first plans to develop modern-day Park Slope arose in 1847 when Colonel Daniel Richards requested permission from the Brooklyn Common Council to develop the Eighth Ward&#x27;s streets. Richards also proposed the renovation of the nearby Gowanus Creek into a canal, including draining the marshes in its watershed. Between 1849 and 1860, under a decree by the New York Legislature, the Gowanus Creek was deepened. Simultaneously, a local lawyer and railroad developer named Edwin Clarke Litchfield (1815–1885) purchased large tracts of what was then farmland, erecting his Litchfield Villa on the east side of the neighborhood in 1857. Through the American Civil War era, Litchfield sold off much of his land to residential developers.

Development increased with the planning and creation of Prospect Park, just east of modern-day Park Slope. In February 1860, a group of fifteen commissioners had submitted suggestions for locations of four large parks and three small parks in Brooklyn. The largest of these proposed parks was a plot east of Ninth and Tenth Avenue in the Eighth Ward. After work was stopped during the Civil War, the proposed park&#x27;s boundaries were changed, shifting the boundaries slightly west and south. In 1868, the City of Brooklyn purchased his estate and adjoining property to complete the West Drive and the southern portion of the Long Meadow in Prospect Park, for the then-exorbitant price of $1.7 million ($ million in ). The modern-day Park Slope was split into the city&#x27;s 22nd Ward the same year.

By the late 1870s, with horse-drawn rail cars running to the park and the ferry, bringing many rich New Yorkers in the process, urban sprawl dramatically changed the neighborhood into a streetcar suburb. The opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883 led to further development in the city of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad extended its Fifth Avenue elevated line to South Brooklyn six years later. During the 1890s, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company added electric trolley lines or converted old stagecoach lines to electric service.

==== Upscale residential neighborhood ====

Many of the large Victorian mansions on Prospect Park West, known as the Gold Coast, were built in the 1880s and 1890s to take advantage of the park views. Early colloquial names for the neighborhood included &quot;Prospect Heights&quot; (later applied to the neighborhood north of Prospect Park), &quot;Prospect Hill&quot;, and &quot;Park Hill Side&quot;, before residents settled on Park Slope. By 1883, with the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, Park Slope continued to boom and subsequent brick and brownstone structures pushed the neighborhood&#x27;s borders farther. The 1890 census showed Park Slope to be the richest community in the United States. Realtors and community members saw a clear connection between Park Slope&#x27;s bucolic setting and the comfort of living there. As the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; wrote in 1899, &quot;Nature set the park down where it is, and man has embellished her work in laying out great lawns and artificial lakes, in bringing together menageries and creating conservatories, in making roads and driveways, and in doing everything in his power to make the place a pleasant pleasure ground and a charming resort.&quot;

Baseball had also played a prominent role in the history of the Park Slope area. From 1879 to 1889, the Brooklyn Atlantics played at Washington Park on 5th Avenue between 3rd and 4th Streets. When the park was destroyed by a fire, the team moved to two other sites. In 1898, the &quot;New&quot; Washington Park was built between Third and Fourth Avenues and between First and Third Streets near the Gowanus Canal. The team, by this point known as the Dodgers, played to an ever-growing fan base at this location, and team owner Charles Ebbets moved the team to his Ebbets Field stadium in Flatbush for the beginning of the 1913 season. The Federal League&#x27;s Brooklyn Tip-Tops rebuilt much of the park in concrete and steel and played there for two years, in 1914 and 1915, before the league folded. A portion of the ballpark&#x27;s wall still exists today on Fourth Avenue.

=== 20th century to present ===
Following Brooklyn&#x27;s subsumption into the City of Greater New York in 1898 and accelerating in the 1910s, many wealthy and upper middle-class families fled for the suburban life, initially to outlying Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods (such as nearby Flatbush) and thence to more distant locales in Westchester County, Nassau County and New Jersey amid the adoption of the automobile. Manhattan gained economic and cultural dominance in the consolidated city, helped by transportation improvements like the subway, which brought a more heterogeneous population to Brooklyn. Existing families adapted by relocating to exclusive districts in the other boroughs, most notably the Upper East Side. Accordingly, Park Slope gradually became a more working class neighborhood amid the subdivision of the expansive Victorian-era housing stock into apartment buildings and rooming houses.

The socioeconomic changes were slowed by the ongoing development of upscale apartment houses on Prospect Park West and Plaza Street along with infill middle-class buildings throughout the neighborhood. Only a fraction of the area, centered in the traditional Gold Coast district and select adjoining blocks, retained wealthy and upper middle-class residents into the 1940s. The Emery Roth-designed 35 Prospect Park West, marketed as a competitor to the upscale apartment houses of Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue and Central Park West, opened right before the Great Depression in 1929, and contained a variety of luxury accommodations (including penthouses, duplexes and maisonettes) alongside &quot;just plain apartments&quot;. While the building attracted such notable residents as pharmaceutical executive John L. Smith and remained a &quot;solid fortress of wealth&quot; for decades, it ultimately failed to anchor comparable development in the neighborhood.

By the 1950s, the working-class Italian-American and Irish-American populations predominated, though this changed by the 1970s as the black and Latino population of the area increased and the white ethnic population began to relocate amid the less exclusive, though effectively segregated, wave of postwar suburbanization. However, the area straddling Flatbush and Washington Avenues between Prospect Park and Atlantic Avenue began to attract a population that was mostly African-American and West Indian-American, similar to neighboring Crown Heights. This area was increasingly identified as the separate neighborhood of Prospect Heights, a moniker that had previously been used to identify areas of Park Slope outside the Gold Coast.

Some of those that remained reacted violently to the ethnic changes to the neighborhood; for example, white residents of Park Slope attempted to bar African-Americans from participating in after-school programs at William Alexander Middle School in 1966. After this failed, white teenagers engaged in firebomb attacks on African-American homes on Fourth Street. In 1968, a street fight between Italian and African-American gangs occurred at Fifth Avenue and President Street, using bricks and bottles as weapons; in the aftermath of the fight, fourteen African-Americans and three Italian-Americans were arrested.

On December 16, 1960, two airliners collided above Staten Island, killing 134 people in what was the worst U.S. aviation disaster at that time. One of the airplanes, a Douglas DC-8 operated by United Airlines, was able to stay airborne for a few miles before crashing near the corner of Sterling Place and Seventh Avenue. Everyone on board was instantly killed, except for one 11-year-old boy, Stephen Baltz, who died the following night at New York Methodist Hospital. Six people on the ground were also killed.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the renovation of a now-$4.8 million brownstone along Berkeley Place sparked a trend where the rest of the brownstones were cleaned up and the grittiness of the neighborhood began to fade. Young professionals began to buy and renovate brownstones (which only cost around $15,000–35,000 at the time), often converting them from rooming houses into single and two-family homes. Preservationists helped secure landmark status for many of the neighborhood&#x27;s blocks of historic row houses, brownstone, and Queen Anne, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque mansions. After the 1973 creation of the landmark district, primarily above 7th Avenue, the rate of gentrification was sped up, and throughout the 1970s, the area saw an influx of young professional couples.

By the early 1980s, however, even as the gentrification of the neighborhood was rapidly proceeding, crime was soaring, along with crime in the rest of New York City. The neighborhood was affected by daily armed muggings within the Prospect Park area especially at night primarily from the high crime neighboring area of UnderHill known as Prospect Heights. Gentrification accelerated during the 1980s and 1990s, as working-class families were displaced and discriminated due to classism regardless of race, many of those displaced being Italian, Irish and Hispanic. These gentrifiers were generally Manhtattanites attracted by the neighborhood&#x27;s low cost of living and historic, turn-of-the-century housing stock. Following decades of socioeconomic precarity, the influx of the upper middle class has returned Park Slope to its Gilded Age milieu as one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Brooklyn—and the nation. Sociologist and urban theorist Sharon Zukin has written of the trend, &quot;In Park Slope, the middle class found a sense of history and a picturesque quality that fit their sense of themselves.&quot; Since the mid-1990s, gentrification has increased: a 2001 report by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board found that from 1990 to 1999, rents in Park Slope increased by 3.5–4.4% per year, depending on what kind of building the apartment was in.

==Land use==
Park Slope contains a variety of zoning districts, including manufacturing, commercial, residential, and mixed-use. Much of the neighborhood is composed of rowhouses and six-to-eight-story apartment buildings, though Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Avenues contain residential structures with commercial space on the ground floors. The westernmost portion of Park Slope near the Gowanus Canal is a light industrial district. The section of Seventh Avenue south of Ninth Street is largely zoned for low-density commercial use.

=== Official landmarks ===
Much of Park Slope is located within the Park Slope Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The historic district was also designated by the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1973; the city-designated district was extended to the south in 2012 and to the north in 2016. Containing 2,575 buildings stretching over part or all of around 40 city blocks, the historic district is New York&#x27;s largest landmark neighborhood.

Several other structures in Park Slope are both NRHP and city landmarks:
* 14th Regiment Armory, an armory built in 1891–95 and designed in the Late Victorian style
* Litchfield Villa, an Italianate mansion built in 1854–1857 on a large private estate now located in Prospect Park
* Public Bath No. 7, a bathhouse built between 1906 and 1910 in the style of a Renaissance palazzo
* Public School 39, built in 1876–1877 in the Italianate and Second Empire styles
* William B. Cronyn House, built in 1856 in the Second Empire style

Additionally, the Brooklyn Public Library&#x27;s Park Slope branch, a Carnegie library built in 1905–06, is a city landmark. The Fourth Avenue station and 15th Street–Prospect Park station are NRHP landmarks that are part of the New York City Subway System Multiple Property Submission (MPS). The Old Stone House, a 1930 reconstruction of the Vechte-Cortelyou House destroyed in 1897, is another NRHP listing and is located on Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues.

The Grand Prospect Hall, an NRHP-listed banquet hall on Prospect Avenue, was built in 1892 and was demolished in 2022.

<doc id="765343" wikidata="Q1485883" url="?curid=765343" title="USS Carney">
<text>USS &quot;Carney&quot; (DDG-64) is the fourteenth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. The guided-missile destroyer is the first to be named after Admiral Robert Carney, who served as Chief of Naval Operations during the Eisenhower administration.

&quot;Carney&quot; was laid down in 1993 at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. She was launched in 1994 with Betty Taussig, daughter of Admiral Carney, as sponsor. She was placed in commission in 1996, and is homeported in Mayport, Florida. She has a range of 5,100 miles (4,400 nautical miles), travels at a speed in excess of 30 knots, and has a crew of 329. She is armed with standard missiles, Harpoon missile launchers, Tomahawk missiles, a 54 caliber lightweight gun, and torpedoes, and carries a multi-mission helicopter.

In 2002, she deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2011, &quot;Carney&quot; disrupted four piracy attempts and disarmed and captured 30 suspected pirates, in support of Operation Ocean Shield in the Gulf of Aden. In 2016, &quot;Carney&quot; took part in Operation Odyssey Lightning, against ISIS militants in Libya.

In December 2023, &quot;Carney&quot; and civilian-owned ships were attacked in the Red Sea, with ballistic missiles fired and drones launched from Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

==Service history==
===1998–2010===

&quot;Carney&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14 prior to commissioning. &quot;Carney&quot; transferred to Destroyer Squadron 24 in September 1998. Her first deployment was to the Mediterranean Sea in 1997 and 1998 as part of the battle group. In 1999 &quot;Carney&quot; deployed again to the Mediterranean, setting a milestone as the first United States Navy ship to operate in a bilateral United States-Japan Naval Exercise to be conducted in the Mediterranean Sea. In May 2001 &quot;Carney&quot; participated in Fleet Week in New York City.

In February 2002, &quot;Carney&quot; operated as part of the battle group while conducting phase one of technical evaluations of Cooperative Engagement Capability systems in the waters of Puerto Rico. Phase two of these evaluations were then conducted in the Virginia Capes operating area. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf in 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On 10 June 2002 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visited the ship in Manama, Bahrain. In December 2003 &quot;Carney&quot; participated in a Vandel Exercise testing the capability to intercept hostile missiles with the ship&#x27;s missiles. On 13 August 2004 &quot;Carney&quot; put to sea from Naval Station Mayport in order to avoid the effects of Hurricane Charley.

In March and April 2007, &quot;Carney&quot; visited St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Lucia, and Barbados to show the U.S.&#x27;s commitment to stability to its regional partners. During a visit to Barbados, &quot;Carney&quot; hosted a reception. Among the guests were Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur.

In November 2007, &quot;Carney&quot; deployed with Carrier Strike Group 10, led by the aircraft carrier , to the Middle East, where she carried out Theater Security Operations. She completed a number of multi-national exercises with a number of Middle Eastern countries and returned to Naval Station Mayport on 4 June 2008. In July 2008, &quot;Carney&quot; was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for Fourth of July celebrations. On 8 September 2009 &quot;Carney&quot; arrived in New York City to participate in the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s arrival.

On 2 January 2010 &quot;Carney&quot; departed homeport for a scheduled deployment in the U.S. 5th Fleet and 6th Fleet AoR, as part of the carrier strike group. In May, the &quot;Carney&quot; took a month&#x27;s sabbatical from Combined Task Force 150 and Combined Task Force 151 security operations, leaving the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC) to participate in three separate and back-to-back multinational exercises: Arabian Shark 2010, an anti-submarine warfare exercise with Pakistan; Khunjar Haad 2010, an air defense exercise with Oman; and Eagle Salute 2010, a multi-warfare area exercise hosted by Egypt, returning to Naval Station Mayport on 31 July 2010.

===2011–2019===
On 1 August 2011, &quot;Carney&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport for a scheduled deployment as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG 1). During the deployment, she disrupted four piracy attempts, boarded nine vessels, approached 28 suspected pirate vessels, and disarmed and captured 30 suspected pirates in support of Operation Ocean Shield in the Gulf of Aden.

On 17 October 2013, &quot;Carney&quot; departed Naval Station Mayport for a scheduled independent deployment. On 25 May 2014, &quot;Carney&quot; returned to Naval Station Mayport after a seven-month Persian Gulf deployment in support of Maritime Intercept Operations (MIO).

On 25 September 2015, &quot;Carney&quot; arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Rota, Spain, after a 19-day transit from Naval Station Mayport. On 29 July 2016, &quot;Carney&quot; was called on to support the rescue of 97 migrants whose small inflatable watercraft was adrift in the water. The ship provided aid to the migrants until the arrival of a rescue ship, MS &quot;Aquarius&quot;.

In August 2016, &quot;Carney&quot; took part in Operation Odyssey Lightning, serving as an escort ship to amphibious assault ship , whose aircraft carried out airstrikes on ISIS militants in Libya. &quot;Carney&quot; also fired illumination rounds from her 5-inch gun to help U.S.-backed Libyan ground forces fighting ISIS in Sirte. &quot;Carney&quot; also conducted shore bombardments of ISIS targets with her 5-inch gun, firing 285 shells during the course of the deployment.

In November 2016, &quot;Carney&quot; was deployed in Drapetsona port, Greece, to provide air cover for President Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Athens. In late March 2017 &quot;Carney&quot; arrived at HMNB Clyde in Scotland in preparation for NATO Exercise Joint Warrior.

On 17 February 2018, &quot;Carney&quot; joined in the Black Sea near Russia for an &quot;unspecified regional proactive presence mission&quot;. The move followed increased tensions between Russia and the U.S. after American federal prosecutors announced indictments against 13 Russian citizens for their alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

===2020–present===
On 27 June 2020, &quot;Carney&quot; departed Rota, Spain, for her homeport shift to Mayport, Florida.

On 8 October 2023, the day after the Hamas attack on Israel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response. Along with the carrier, the group includes the cruiser , and the destroyers &quot;Carney&quot;, , and . From then until December 2023, the destroyer was at the forefront of operations to destroy Houthi drones and missiles in the Red Sea, as commercial vessels repeatedly came under attack by the Iran-allied Houthi militants in Yemen.

On 19 October 2023, &quot;Carney&quot; intercepted three cruise missiles and eight drones fired by Houthi militants in Yemen. Although the targets were uncertain, the missiles and drones were shot down because they were headed north along the Red Sea in the direction of Israel amid rising tensions in the region during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. It was subsequently reported that &quot;Carney&quot; actually encountered a larger and more sustained barrage than was previously known on that day, shooting down four cruise missiles and 15 drones over a period of nine hours. On 29 November 2023, &quot;Carney&quot; shot down a KAS-04 drone launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen in the Red Sea. 

On 3 December 2023, &quot;Carney&quot; and civilian-owned commercial ships were attacked in international waters in the southern Red Sea, with anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Yemen by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Missiles struck three commercial ships, while &quot;Carney&quot; shot down three drones in self-defense during the hours-long assault. The United States Central Command said in a statement: &quot;We ... have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran.&quot; On 16 December 2023 while operating in the Red Sea, &quot;Carney&quot; successfully shot down a barrage of 14 unmanned aerial system (UAS) one-way attack drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, head of U.S. 5th Fleet, subsequently visited the ship and presented combat medals to five sailors for their &quot;exceptional performance&quot; in the engagement. Cooper also recognized the whole crew of the &quot;Carney&quot; with the Navy&#x27;s Combat Action Ribbon, which is awarded when a sailor has “rendered satisfactory performance under enemy fire while actively participating in a ground or surface combat engagement&quot;. Carney’s commanding officer, Commander Jeremy Robertson, and another sailor received Navy Commendation Medals from Cooper, and Robertson received a Bronze Star, while three other crew members received Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals.

On 13 January 2024, &quot;Carney&quot; conducted follow-on action by firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at Houthi rebels in Yemen a day after the main strike package. Later, &quot;Carney&quot; and other coalition ships responded to a strike by the Houthis on the British oil tanker MV &quot;Marlin Luanda&quot; on 26 January 2024. She arrived on scene a few hours after INS &quot;Visakhapatnam&quot; to render firefighting aid. On 26 January 2024, &quot;Carney&quot; shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis in the Gulf of Aden. On 30 January 2024, &quot;Carney&quot; reportedly shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis in the Gulf of Aden with an SM-6 missile, marking the first publicly acknowledged SM-6 combat intercept by the DOD.

On 5 March 2024, &quot;Carney&quot; shot down one anti-ship ballistic missile and three one-way attack unmanned aerial systems launched by the Houthis in the Red Sea. On 13–14 April 2024, &quot;Carney&quot; and shot down at least six Iranian ballistic missiles during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel. &quot;Carney&quot; returned to Naval Station Mayport on 20 May 2024 after a seven-month deployment and fifty-one Houthi Engagements. During the course of her deployment, &quot;Carney&quot; participated in the second most amount of combat of any U.S. Naval ship since World War II.

==Upgrades==
On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that &quot;Carney&quot; would be upgraded during fiscal 2012 to RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) capability in order to function as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.

In 2016, four destroyers patrolling with the U.S. 6th Fleet based in Naval Station Rota, Spain, including &quot;Carney&quot; received self-protection upgrades, replacing the aft Phalanx CIWS 20mm Vulcan cannon with the SeaRAM 11-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher. The SeaRam uses the same sensor dome as the Phalanx. This was the first time the close-range ship defense system was paired with an Aegis ship. All four ships to receive the upgrade were either Flight I or II, meaning they originally had two Phalanx CIWS systems when launched. SeaRAM was first introduced to the Independence-class littoral combat ship.

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
Azure, a cross pattée or bearing a Viking helmet Proper, in chief four mullets of the second. Symbolism: Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy and recall the sea and excellence. The gold cross suggests the Navy Cross, one of the many decorations awarded to Admiral Carney for operations against enemy Japanese forces during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, from 23 to 26 October 1944... &quot;(He) rendered invaluable assistance in formulating the plans for a series of combat operations in which tack forces of the third fleet engaged capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, waging devastating attacks on major Japanese combatant and aircraft carrier task forces in the vicinity of Mindora, the Sulu Sea, and areas northeast of Luzon and off the central Philippines...&quot;

The helmet is symbolic of ancestral Viking and Celtic ferocity in combat. The four stars stand for the four Distinguished Service Medals received. Crest: Issuing from a wreath Or and Azure, three demi-spears. The two spears form a &quot;V&quot; alluding to Admiral Carney&#x27;s Legion of Merit with a &quot;V&quot; (Combat Distinguishing Device) for exceptionally meritorious conduct...in action against enemy Japanese forces... 5 March 1943 – 6 March 1943 and the Bronze Star Medal with combat &quot;V&quot; for operations in the Solomon Islands area on the night of 29 July 1943. The three spears represent submarine, surface and air warfare. The anchor is reminiscent of Maritime tradition, United States naval strength, sea prowess and excellence of achievement. Motto: A tripartite scroll Azure doubled, garnished and inscribed &quot;RESOLUTE COMMITTED SUCCESSFUL&quot; in gold the coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, all upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS CARNEY&quot; at top and &quot;DDG 64&quot; in base all gold.

<doc id="765346" wikidata="Q1415236" url="?curid=765346" title="USS Benfold">
<text>USS &quot;Benfold&quot; (DDG-65) is a Flight I in the United States Navy. She is a multi-mission platform capable of anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) with the powerful Aegis Combat System suite and anti-aircraft missiles, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), with towed sonar array, anti-submarine rockets, anti-surface warfare (ASUW) with Harpoon missiles, and strategic land strike using Tomahawk missiles. &quot;Benfold&quot; was one of the first ships fitted with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and during the 2010 Stellar Daggers exercise was the first ship to simultaneously engage a ballistic missile and a cruise missile.

Former &quot;Benfold&quot; commanding officers include Admiral Mark Ferguson, Admiral Michael Gilday, Vice Admiral Thomas H. Copeman III, and author D. Michael Abrashoff.

==Design, construction and improvements==
Built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation in Pascagoula, Mississippi, &quot;Benfold&quot; is the 15th of a planned 90 &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class guided missile destroyers. Named for posthumous Korean War United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipient Hospital Corpsman Third Class Edward Clyde Benfold, she joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet for service on 30 March 1996.

Equipped with the Aegis air-defense system and the Mark-41 Vertical Launch System for multiple types of guided missiles, &quot;Benfold&quot; is capable of defensive and offensive operations against warplanes, anti-ship missiles, surface ships, submarines, and shore targets. In addition to her missiles, she carries one 5-inch rapid-fire naval gun for action against surface ships and for shore bombardment. She also carries anti-submarine torpedoes, and two Phalanx CIWS anti-missile guns. She has a flight deck for MH-60R/S Seahawk Helicopters and is capable of refueling and re-arming these helicopters, but she does not have a hangar for storing and maintaining helicopters.

===Modernization 2011===

In 2011, &quot;Benfold&quot; entered drydock at BAE Systems, San Diego to receive an extensive $32 million mid-life upgrade. The hull mechanical and electrical (HM&amp;E) upgrades included a fully integrated bridge, improved machinery and damage control, quality of life improvements, an advanced galley, and commercial-off-the-shelf computing equipment.

===Modernization 2013===
In 2013, &quot;Benfold&quot; underwent extensive combat systems upgrades to include the installation of Aegis Baseline 9C, Ballistic Missile Defense version 5.0, A(V) 15 SONAR Suite, and also became Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) capable.

===Naval exercises 2012===

In 2012, &quot;Benfold&quot; was the first San Diego–based naval ship invited to participate in the Koa Kai naval exercises. &quot;Benfold&quot; conducted integrated flight operations, anti-surface and anti-submarine training, dynamic ship maneuvers, ballistic missile defense, small boat attacks and Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) utilizing the Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) team.

===Collision===
On 19 November 2017 &quot;Benfold&quot; was involved in a minor collision with a Japanese commercial tug off Sagami Bay. The tug lost power and drifted into &quot;Benfold&quot;, causing damage described as minimal, with some scraping to the ship&#x27;s side. There were no injuries reported on either vessel; &quot;Benfold&quot; continued at sea, while the tug was towed to Yokosuka.

=== Freedom of Navigation operations ===
&quot;Benfold&quot; has conducted the following Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) in the South China Sea:
* 12 July 2021 – Paracel Islands
* 8 September 2021 – Spratly Islands
* 18 January 2022 – Spratly Islands
* 20 January 2022 – Paracel Islands
* 13 July 2022 – Paracel Islands
* 16 July 2022 – Spratly Islands

In 2022, &quot;Benfold&quot; was praised by Seventh Fleet leadership as an exemplar of good ship preservation. On 6 August 2023, &quot;Benfold&quot; and three other destroyers responded to a joint Chinese-Russian patrol in international waters near Alaska. The Chinese–Russian flotilla left without incident.

On 9 August 2023, the Navy announced plans to extend the ship&#x27;s service life beyond the initial 35 years, intending to keep &quot;Benfold&quot; in service until at least 2036. The Navy has announced plans to rotate &quot;Benfold&quot; to Everett, Washington, replacing her in Japan with .

<doc id="765350" wikidata="Q1369386" url="?curid=765350" title="Lytic cycle">
<text>The lytic cycle ( ) is one of the two cycles of viral reproduction (referring to bacterial viruses or bacteriophages), the other being the lysogenic cycle. The lytic cycle results in the destruction of the infected cell and its membrane. Bacteriophages that can only go through the lytic cycle are called virulent phages (in contrast to temperate phages).

In the lytic cycle, the viral DNA exists as a separate free floating molecule within the bacterial cell, and replicates separately from the host bacterial DNA, whereas in the lysogenic cycle, the viral DNA is integrated into the host genome. This is the key difference between the lytic and lysogenic cycles. However, in both cases the virus/phage replicates using the host DNA machinery.

==Description==
The lytic cycle is often separated into six stages: attachment, penetration, transcription, biosynthesis, maturation, and lysis.
# Attachment – the phage attaches itself to the surface of the host cell in order to inject its DNA into the cell
# Penetration – the phage injects its DNA into the host cell by penetrating through the cell membrane
# Transcription – the host cell&#x27;s DNA is degraded and the cell&#x27;s metabolism is directed to initiate phage biosynthesis
# Biosynthesis – the phage DNA replicates inside the cell, synthesizing new phage DNA and proteins
# Maturation – the replicated material assembles into fully formed viral phages (each made up of a head, a tail and tail fibers)
# Lysis - cell wall or membrane ruptures, disintegrating it and releasing the virus in the process

== Attachment and penetration ==
To infect a host cell, the virus must first inject its own nucleic acid into the cell through the plasma membrane and (if present) the cell wall. The virus does so by either attaching to a receptor on the cell&#x27;s surface or by simple mechanical force. The binding is due to electrostatic interactions and is influenced by pH and the presence of ions. The virus then releases its genetic material (either single- or double-stranded RNA or DNA) into the cell. In some viruses this genetic material is circular and mimics a bacterial plasmid. At this stage the cell becomes infected and can also be targeted by the immune system. It is mostly aided by receptors on the surface of the cell. The sequence of events that occur during initiation of bacteriophage infection, from adsorption (attachment) through DNA ejection from the virion into the host cell (penetration), was reviewed by Molineux.

== Transcription and biosynthesis ==
During the transcription and biosynthesis stages, the virus hijacks the cell&#x27;s replication and translation mechanisms, using them to make more viruses. The virus&#x27;s nucleic acid uses the host cell&#x27;s metabolic machinery to make large amounts of viral components.

In DNA viruses, the DNA transcribes itself into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are then used to direct the cell&#x27;s ribosomes. One of the first polypeptides to be translated destroys the host&#x27;s DNA. In retroviruses (which inject an RNA strand), the enzyme reverse transcriptase transcribes the viral RNA into DNA, which is then transcribed again into RNA. Once the viral DNA has taken control it induces the host cell&#x27;s machinery to synthesize viral DNA and proteins and begins to multiply.

The biosynthesis is (e.g. T4) regulated in three phases of mRNA production followed by a phase of protein production.

;Early phase
:Enzymes modify the host&#x27;s transcriptional process by RNA polymerase. Amongst other modifications, virus T4 changes the sigma factor of the host by producing an anti-sigma factor so that the host promotors are not recognized any more but now recognize T4 middle proteins. For protein synthesis Shine-Dalgarno subsequence GAGG dominates an early genes translation.

;Middle phase
:Virus nucleic acid (DNA or RNA depending on virus type).

;Late phase
:Structural proteins including those for the head and the tail.

== Maturation and lysis ==
About 25 minutes after initial infection, approximately 200 new virions (viral bodies) are formed. Once enough virions have matured and accumulated, specialized viral proteins are used to dissolve the cells&#x27; walls. The cell bursts (i.e. it undergoes lysis) due to high internal osmotic pressure that can no longer be constrained by the cell wall. This releases progeny virions into the surrounding environment, where they can go on to infect other cells and another lytic cycle begins. 

==Gene regulation biochemistry==
There are three classes of genes in the phage genome that regulate whether the lytic or lysogenic cycles will emerge. The first class is the immediate early genes, the second is the delayed early genes and the third is the late genes. The following refers to the well-studied temperate phage lambda of &quot;E. coli.&quot;

# Immediate early genes: These genes are expressed from promoters recognized by the host RNA polymerase, and include &quot;Cro&quot;, &quot;cII&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;. CII is a transcription factor that stimulates expression of the main lysogenic repressor gene, &quot;cI&quot;, whereas Cro is a repressor for &quot;cI&quot; expression. The lysis-lysogeny decision is mainly influenced by the competition between Cro and CII, resulting in the determination of whether or not sufficient CI repressor is made. If so, CI represses the early promoters and the infection is shunted into the lysogenic pathway. N is an anti-termination factor that is needed for the transcription of the delayed early genes.
# Delayed early genes: These include the replication genes &quot;O&quot; and &quot;P&quot; and also &quot;Q&quot;, which encodes the anti-terminator responsible for transcription of all the late genes.
# Late genes:

Q-mediated turn-on of late transcription begins about 6–8 min after infection if the lytic pathway is chosen. More than 25 genes are expressed from the single late promoter, resulting in four parallel biosynthetic pathways. Three of the pathways are for production of the three components of the virion: the DNA-filled head, the tail, and the side tail fibers. The virions self-assemble from these components, with the first virion appearing at about 20 min after infection. The fourth pathway is for lysis. In lambda 5 proteins are involved in lysis: the holin and antiholin from gene &quot;S&quot;, the endolysin from gene &quot;R&quot; and the spanin proteins from genes &quot;Rz&quot; and &quot;Rz1&quot;. In wild-type lambda, lysis occurs at about 50 min, releasing approximately 100 completed virions. The timing of lysis is determined by the holin and antiholin proteins, with the latter inhibiting the former. In overview, the holin protein accumulates in the cytoplasmic membrane until suddenly forming micron-scale holes, which triggers lysis. The endolysin R is released to the periplasm, where it attacks the peptidoglycan. The spanin proteins Rz and Rz1 accumulate in the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, respectively, and form a complex spanning the periplasm through the meshwork of the peptidoglycan. When the endolysin degrades the peptidoglycan, the spanin complexes are liberated and cause disruption of the outer membrane. Destruction of the peptidoglycan by the endolysin and disruption of the outer membrane by the spanin complex are both required for lysis in lambda infections.

Lysis inhibition: T4-like phages have two genes, &quot;rI&quot; and &quot;rIII&quot;, that inhibit the T4 holin, if the infected cell undergoes super-infection by another T4 (or closely related) virion. Repeated super-infection can cause the T4 infection to continue without lysis for hours, leading to accumulation of virions to levels 10-fold higher than normal.

<text>USS &quot;Gonzalez&quot; (DDG-66) is sixteenth (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for Sergeant Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez, a Medal of Honor recipient in the Vietnam War.

==Service history==
November 12, 1996 &quot;Gonzalez&quot; grounded on a coral reef at approximately 0800, off the island of Sint Maarten, damaging her sonar dome and several blades on both screws, costing $10 million in damage returning to service September 1997.

The ship took part in Operation Allied Force, firing Tomahawk cruise missiles at Serbian targets in 1999. &quot;Gonzalez&quot; also assisted a cruise ship, , after an abortive attack by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2005.

On 1 March 2006, the ship rescued the crew of an Iranian ship, whose engine and rudder were broken down since 18 February. The Iranian crew were returned to Iran. She was involved in the action of 18 March 2006 with suspected pirates, along with the cruiser . The two ships exchanged fire with the suspected pirates about off the coast of Somalia. Initial reports indicated that one suspected pirate was killed and five others wounded.

On 17 July 2006, CNN reported that &quot;Gonzalez&quot; would be deployed to help in evacuation efforts of American citizens from Lebanon in the midst of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict.

In May 2022, &quot;Gonzalez&quot; was homeported out of Naval Station Norfolk and a part of Destroyer Squadron 28, along with Carrier Strike Group 8 led by the .

<text>Czech National Social Party (Czech: &quot;Česká strana národně sociální&quot;, ČSNS) is a nationalist political party in the Czech Republic, that played an important role in Czechoslovakia during the interwar period. It was established in 1897 by break-away groups from both the national liberal Young Czech Party and the Czech Social Democratic Party, with a stress on achieving independence of the Czech lands from Austria-Hungary (as opposed to the Social Democrats&#x27; aim for an international workers&#x27; revolution). Its variant of socialism was moderate and reformist rather than a Marxist one. After the National Labour Party dissolved and merged with National Socialists in 1930, the party also became the refuge for Czech liberals. Its best-known member was Edvard Beneš, a co-founder of Czechoslovakia and the country&#x27;s second President during the 1930s and 1940s.

Despite the similar name, the Czech &quot;National Socialists&quot; were not affiliated with Nazism or the German Nazi Party. While the early ČSNS made use of antisemitic rhetoric, the party completely abandoned such positions after the First World War, when it renamed to Czechoslovak (National) Socialist Party. Instead, party representatives in the majority supported Zionism and highly supported German Jewish refugees in the 1930s. The party liquidated itself after the Munich Agreement of 1938. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Nazis persecuted (former) party members, who in turn offered resistance against the occupying forces or worked in exile.

After the Second World War, the party was revived and became the second strongest party, behind the Communists. After the latter took power in the 1948 coup d&#x27;état, the ČSS&#x27;s role was reduced to a bloc party. Anti-communist members were persecuted again, forced to exile, or even executed like Milada Horáková. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the party failed to regain its importance. Since the 1990s, several splinter parties claim to continue the ČSNS&#x27;s tradition.

==History==
The party was founded in 1897 and was led by Václav Klofáč, with support from Jiří Stříbrný and Emil Franke as well. The party platform relied on the social traditions of Hussitism and Taboritism, but it was also a programme of &quot;collectivizing by means of development, surmounting of class struggle by national discipline, moral rebirth and democracy as the conditions of socialism, a powerful popular army, etc.&quot;

In 1918 the party changed its name from the Czech National Social Party to the Czech Socialist Party, in 1919 to the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, and in 1926 to the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party. Edvard Beneš took de facto party leadership, although de jure, it was his ally Václav Klofáč. Jiří Stříbrný and his supporters were expelled for disagreements with Václav Klofáč and Edvard Beneš. The expelled Stříbrný faction later cooperated with the fascist movement and National Democratic Party.

In its first years, the party bore some resemblance to National-Social Association in Germany. During the early 1920s, the party was an observer to the Labour and Socialist International, but never became a member due to disputes over internationalism. Its main international affiliation during the 1920s and 1930s was to the International Entente of Radical and Similar Democratic Parties (&quot;Radical International&quot;), a centre-left international for non-Marxist progressive democratic parties whose chief member was the French Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party. It also had close links with similar parties such as the Russian Narodniks of Alexander Kerensky and the People&#x27;s Socialist Party in Yugoslavia. During the World War II, the exiled leadership of the party also cooperated with the British Labour Party.

From 1921, the party was part of most Czechoslovak government coalitions. Its newspaper was the &quot;České slovo&quot;. After German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, most of the Czech membership joined left-wing National Labour Party, while a minority joined right-wing Party of National Unity led by Rudolf Beran, and a few of its Slovak members joined the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party led by Jozef Tiso.

Under German occupation, the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party functioned in exile and most of its members were active in the resistance movement. After 1945, the party resurfaced, under the leadership of Petr Zenkl, as one of the parties in the National Front. When Czechoslovakia became a Communist state in 1948, communist militias seized the party headquarters and the puppet leadership expelled most of its members for alleged fascist sympathies. The party was again renamed the Czechoslovak Socialist Party and operated as pro-communist bloc-party. In exile, Petr Zenkl led the Council of Free Czechoslovakia in London.

During the Velvet Revolution in 1989, a significant part of the party participated in the creation of the Civic Forum. After the return to democracy in 1989, the National Front was abolished. The party renamed itself the Liberal National Social Party (Liberální strana národně sociální), but failed to gather any significant support and was reduced to minor party status. It was shut out of the federal parliament in both elections held in 1990 elections. In 1992, the party operated inside the Liberal-Social Union and managed to gain a few seats in parliament. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia with its support hovering below the five-percent threshold, it merged with the Free Democrats, to form the Free DemocratsLiberal National Social Party. However, in the 1996 elections, its support tumbled to 2.1 percent and it was shut out of the legislature, never to return.

After the 1996 elections, the party split and was renamed again in 1997 to the Czech National Social Party. Having fallen well short of returning to parliament and crippled by financial debts, the party has almost disappeared. In 2017, Karel Schwarzenberg and Mirek Topolánek said that the Civic Democratic Party can be considered a spiritual successor to the pre-war Czechoslovak National Social Party.

<text>USS &quot;Milius&quot; (DDG-69) is the nineteenth &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. It is the first United States Navy Ship named after a POW/MIA from the Vietnam War. She is named after Captain Paul L. Milius, a Naval Aviator presumed killed following the crash of his aircraft over Laos in February 1968. Captain Milius&#x27;s daughter, Annette, became the sponsor and later christened the ship named in honor of her father.

==Service history==
In January 2005, &quot;Milius&quot; participated in Operation Unified Assistance. On 6 December 2006, the ship successfully launched a Block IV Tomahawk cruise missile for the first time in a test of the Block IV configuration. The launch took place in the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division Sea Test Range off of California. The missile flew 869 miles before impacting its target on the land range at China Lake, California.

On 12 September 2007, the Embassy of the United States, Manila stated that the arrival of the destroyers and USS &quot;Milius&quot; was a goodwill visit to strengthen Philippines–United States relations.

== Coat of arms ==
The ship’s crest is designed in remembrance of the military service of the ship’s namesake, Captain Paul Lloyd Milius, and the courage and dedication that promoted his selfless act of heroism. 

Dark blue and gold are colors traditionally used by the Navy and denote the sea and excellence. The shield itself reflects the power of the Aegis shield. The double-edged battle-ax symbolizes the power of the modern guided missile destroyer. The battle-ax harnesses is a warning that peace should be maintained; provoked and unleashed, the battle-ax is a punishing offensive weapon capable of delivering crushing blows.  The trident reflects the prowess of MILIUS, capable of projecting sea power on the land, in the air, and on and beneath the sea.  The crossed swords are the modern Navy sword of today and the cutlass of the John Paul Jones era symbolizing the enduring tradition and heritage of the United States Navy.  The border, for unity, is red highlighting readiness for action and sacrifice, if necessary.  The seven bolts on the border represent the seven lives saved by Captain Milius’ heroic action. 

The lion suggests Captain Milius’ extraordinary heroism as the aircraft commander in Observation Squadron Sixty-Seven for which he received the Navy Cross, represented by the cross plate, and underscored his selfless courage and inspiring devotion to duty.  

Alii Prae Me, or “Others Before Myself,” was chosen to reflect the personal ethic held throughout Captain Milius’ military career and his selfless act under fire.

<doc id="765359" wikidata="Q489021" url="?curid=765359" title="Sudano-Sahelian architecture">
<text>Sudano-Sahelian architecture refers to a range of similar indigenous architectural styles common to the African peoples of the Sahel and Sudanian grassland (geographical) regions of West Africa, south of the Sahara, but north of the fertile forest regions of the coast.

This style is characterized by the use of mudbricks and adobe plaster, with large wooden-log support beams that jut out from the wall face for large buildings such as mosques or palaces. These beams also act as scaffolding for reworking, which is done at regular intervals, and involves the local community.

== Historical background ==
Large Neolithic proto-urban walled stone settlements, likely built by Mande-speaking Soninke peoples date from around 1,600-400 BC at Dhar Tichitt and nearby sites in southeastern Mauritania. Other early examples of Sudano-Sahelian style are probably from Dia around 600 BC and Jenné-Jeno around 250 BC, both in Mali, where the first evidence of permanent mudbrick architecture in the region is found, including residences and a large city wall. The first Great Mosque of Djenné (built around 1200 to 1330) in modern Mali, according to traditional accounts, was constructed on the site of an older pre-Islamic palace by the city&#x27;s king. 

Starting in the 9th century AD, Muslim merchants came to play a vital role in the western Sahel region through trans-Saharan trade networks. The earliest mosques discovered in sub-Saharan Africa are at Kumbi Saleh (in present-day southern Mauritania), the former capital of the Ghana Empire. Here, a mosque has been discovered which consisted of a courtyard, a prayer hall, and a square minaret, built in dry stone covered in red mud used as plaster. On both the exterior and interior of the mosque, this plaster was painted with floral, geometric, and epigraphic motifs. A similar stone mosque from the same period has been found at Awdaghust. Both mosques are dated generally between the 9th and 14th centuries. The mosque of Kumbi Saleh appears to have gone through multiple construction phases from the 10th century to the early 14th century. At Kumbi Saleh, locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king&#x27;s section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 mosques (as described by Al-Bakri), one centered on Friday prayer. The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was 66 feet long, 42 feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.

A variety of possible influences on this architecture have been suggested. North African and Andalusi architecture to the north may have been one of these, with the existence of square minarets possibly reflecting the influence of the Great Mosque of Kairouan. As Islamization progressed across the region, more variations developed in mosque architecture, including the adoption of traditional local forms not previously associated with Islamic architecture. Under Songhai influence, minarets took on a more pyramidal appearance and became stepped or tiered on three levels, as exemplified by the tower of the mosque–tomb of Askia al-Hajj Muhammad in Gao (present-day Mali). In Timbuktu, the Sankoré Mosque (established in the 14th-15th centuries and rebuilt in the 16th century, with later additions), had a tapering minaret and a prayer hall with rows of arches. The presence of tapering minarets may also reflect cultural contacts with M&#x27;zab region to the north, while decoration found at Timbuktu may reflect contacts with Berber communities in what is now Mauritania. More local or indigenous pagan cultures may have also been an influence in the later Islamic architecture of the region.

During the French colonial occupation of the Sahel, French engineers and architects had a role in popularizing a &quot;Neo-Sudanese&quot; style based on local traditional architecture but emphasizing symmetry and monumentality. The Great Mosque of Djenné, which was previously established in the 14th century but demolished in the early 19th century, was rebuilt in 1906–1907 under the direction of Ismaila Traoré and with guidance from French engineers. Now the largest earthen (mud) building in sub-Saharan Africa, it served as a model for the new style and for other mosques in the region, including the Grand Mosque of Mopti built by the French administration in 1935. Other 20th-century and more recent mosques in West Africa have tended to replicate a more generic style similar to that of modern Egypt.

== General ==

While the architecture of this region shares a certain style, a wide variety of materials and local styles are evident across this wide geographic range. In the more arid western Sahara and northern Sahel regions, stone predominates as a building material and is often associated with Berber cultures. In the southern Sahel and savannah regions mudbrick and rammed earth are the main material and is now associated with the most monumental examples of West African Islamic architecture. In some places, like Timbuktu and Oualata, both building materials are used together, with stone constructions either covered or bound with a mud plaster.
In the earthen architecture of the region, scholar Andrew Petersen distinguishes two general styles: a &quot;western&quot; style that may have its roots in Djenné (present-day Mali), and an &quot;eastern&quot; style associated with Hausa architecture that may have its roots in Kano (present-day Nigeria). The eastern or Hausa style is generally more plain on the exterior of buildings, but is characterized by diverse interior decoration and the much greater use of wood. Mosques often have prayer halls with pillars supporting flat or slightly domed roofs of wood and mud. An exceptional example is the 19th-century Great Mosque of Zaria (present-day Nigeria), which has parabolic arches and a roof of shallow domes. The western or &quot;Sudan&quot; style is characterized by more elaborate and decorated exterior façades whose compositions emphasize verticality. They have tapering buttresses with cone-shaped summits, mosques have a large tower over the &quot;mihrab&quot;, and wooden stakes (&quot;toron&quot;) are often embedded in the walls &quot;–&quot; used for scaffolding but possibly also for some symbolic purpose.

== Mud architecture building techniques ==

The traditional earth building construction technology has a particular name called “banco” in West Africa, meaning a wet-mud process similar with the concept of coil pottery. When banco technology continues to be the criterion for dwellings in the savannah area, an alternative method is to use earthen brick consequently with wet mud. The brick is cast into rectangular shape and dried in the sun.

One symbol of the Sudanese architecture is the man-made, conical earthen pillars. Being combined with the building itself uniquely, they often project horizontally to the outside like engaged pillars. Being so omnipresent in the vernacular buildings, they can be found singularly or clustered at multiple entrances. As a hallmark of the Sudano Sahelian architecture, they mark the indication of continuity and productivity.

==Variations==
=== Substyles ===
The Sudano-Sahelian architectural style itself can be broken down into four smaller sub-styles that are typical of different ethnic groups in the region. The examples used here illustrate the construction of mosques as well as palaces, as the architectural style is concentrated around inland Muslim populations. As with the people, many of these styles cross-pollinate and produce buildings with shared features. Any one of these styles is not exclusive to one particular modern countries borders, but are linked to the ethnicity of its builders or surrounding populations. For example, a Malian migrant community in traditionally Gur area may build in the style characteristic of their ancestral homeland, while neighbouring Gur buildings are built in the local style. These styles include:
*Malian – of the various Manden groups of southern and central Mali. Characterized by the Great Mosque of Djenné and the Kani-Kombole Mosque of Mali.
*Songhai – of the various Songhai groups of Niger and Northern Mali. Characterized by the Tomb of Askia in Gao, Djingareyber and the Zarmakoy Palace in Dosso
*Fortress style – predominantly used by the Zarma-Songhai peoples of Niger and Mali, Hausa-Fulani, Tuareg and Arab mixed communities in Agadez, and the Kanuri people of Lake Chad. Military aspect to construction of high protective compound walls built around a central courtyard. Minaret is the only structure with support beams showing. Characterized by the Sankore Mosque of Timbuktu, the tomb of Askia in Gao Mali, and the Agadez mosque of northern Niger.
*Hausa – The characteristic Hausa architectural style predominant in North and Northwestern Nigeria, Niger, Eastern Burkina Faso, Northern Benin, and Hausa-predominant &quot;zango&quot; districts and neighbourhoods throughout West Africa. Characterised by its attention of stucco detail in abstract design and extensive use of parapets. One to two storey buildings. Examples in the architecture of the Yamma Mosque and old town of Zinder, The Hausa quarter of Agadez Niger, the Gidan Rumfa of Kano, and various Hausa districts across West Africa.
*Volta basin – of the Gur and Manden groups of Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and northern Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Often the most conservative of the various substyles. Typically features a single courtyard, characterized by high white and black painted walls, inward curved turrets supporting an exterior wall, and a larger turret nearer the center. Characterized by the Larabanga mosque of Ghana and the Bobo-Dioulasso Grand Mosque.
=== Difference between Savannah and Sahelian styles ===
The earthen architecture in the Sahel zone region is noticeably different from the building style in the neighboring savannah. The &quot;old Sudanese&quot; cultivators of the savannah built their compounds out of several cone-roofed houses. This was primarily an urban building style, associated with centres of trade and wealth, characterised by cubic buildings with terraced roofs comprise the typical style.

They lend a characteristic appearance to the close-built villages and cities. Large buildings such as mosques, representative residential and youth houses stand out in the distance. They are landmarks in a flat landscape that point to a complex society of farmers, craftsmen and merchants with a religious and political upper class.

With the expansion of Sahelian kingdoms south to the rural areas in the savannas (inhabited by culturally or ethnically similar groups to those in the Sahel), the Sudano-Sahelian style was reserved for mosques, palaces, the houses of nobility or townsfolk (as is evident in the Gur-Voltaic style), whereas among commonfolk, there was a mix between either typically distinct Sudano-Sahelian styles for wealthier families, and older African roundhut styles for rural villages and family compounds.

== Conservation ==
Several outstanding examples of religious and secular Sudano-Sahelian architecture have been awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The historic centers of Djenné, Mali and Agadez, Niger were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1988 and 2013, respectively. In 2021, 8 small mosques in northern Côte d’Ivoire exemplifying a special type of Volta Basin religious architecture were also inscribed on the World Heritage list. These mosques were probably originally constructed between the 17th and 19th centuries, as trade routes from the Empire of Mali spread to the south.

<text>Émile-Auguste Chartier (; 3 March 1868 – 2 June 1951), commonly known as Alain (), was a French philosopher, journalist, essayist, pacifist, and teacher of philosophy.

==Early life and teaching==
Alain was born in 1868 in Normandy, in the rural town of Mortagne-au-Perche, the son of a veterinary surgeon. After attending the local Catholic school, in 1881 he entered the &quot;lycée&quot; of Alençon, where he passed the examinations of the Baccalaureat in literature (and failed the science Baccalaureat). He proceeded to the &quot;Lycée Michelet&quot; in Vanves, a suburb of Paris, where he came under the influence of the philosopher Jules Lagneau. His exceptional intelligence led him to the Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1889, and to the &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy in 1892. This qualified him for a career as a teacher of philosophy, which he pursued in schools in Lorient, Rouen, Paris and, in particular, the &quot;Lycée Henri IV&quot; from 1909, where he taught the prestigious preparatory classes to the Ecole Normale. Sartre&#x27;s career would begin in a similar way, forty years later. Alain taught at the &quot;Lycée Henri IV&quot;, with an interruption for the First World War, until his retirement in 1933, having chosen not to pursue a Ph.D. and teach in the university system. In these years he gained a reputation as an inspiring teacher; his students included major philosophers such as Simone Weil and Georges Canguilhem, writers such as André Maurois, Julien Gracq, and Roger Judrin, and even great political leaders like Maurice Schuman, a founding father of modern Europe. Alain&#x27;s influence was felt beyond his class: Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir attended his public lectures, and Raymond Aron became a close acquaintance.

He adopted his pseudonym Alain as the most banal he could find. There is no evidence he ever thought in so doing of the 15th century Norman poet Alain Chartier.

== The &quot;propos&quot; ==
In 1903 as part of his political activity in support of the radical party in Rouen, he began contributing brief columns to the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Depêche de Rouen et de Normandie.&quot; He called them &quot;propos&quot;, a difficult word to translate; it implies a proposal, a proposition and, most simply, remarks. In 1906 and after his move to Paris Alain made writing these a daily commitment and one he continued right up to the outbreak of the First World War. By the time he wrote the last, in the train on his way to join his regiment, he’d written over three thousand. 

These short texts, written for a general readership and in a concise and vivid style, with striking sentences and aphorisms, soon attracted a loyal following. They were inspired by topical and everyday events; at first, he commented mainly on politics, but his philosophy and wide interests also became starting points for these improvisations. As Alain put it later, he found that he had a taste for firing arrows at passers-by to get them to look up from their path in life; he liked to provoke. And, as he himself wrote, by not thinking that philosophy was unsuitable for journalism, he invented a genre of journalism. To quote one admirer, the French Socialist leader Jean Jaurès, “the &quot;propos&quot; seem to me to be, in many respects, a masterpiece of French prose.”

He began to write these again, at a slower pace and in other journals, principally &quot;Libres Propos&quot;, in 1921 and continued until 1936, to make a total of around five thousand. They reached an even wider public by being collected in book form, some by subject, so there have been volumes of &quot;propos&quot;  on politics, education, religion, economics, nature, aesthetics, literature etc. The bestseller, a collection which has always remained in print in France is &quot;Propos sur le Bonheur&quot; (translated as &quot;Alain on Happiness)&quot;.

== World War One ==
As war approached Alain campaigned in his writing for peace in Europe, and when war did come, without compromising his views and aged forty-six, he volunteered immediately. As he wrote, he couldn&#x27;t stand the idea of remaining in civilian life, while the &#x27;best&#x27;, who included his own pupils, were sent to be massacred. He was assigned to the artillery where he served conscientiously as a telephonist on the front lines, and refused promotion to the officer ranks. In 1916 his ankle was crushed in the wheel of a cart carrying munitions to Verdun. After several weeks in hospital and an unsuccessful return to the front, he  was transferred to the meteorological service and then demobbed in October 1917.

While convalescing he began to write again, this time more substantial works. The first of these was &quot;Mars ou la guerre jugée (&quot;translated as &quot;Mars, or the truth about war)&quot;, published in 1921. In this he wrote that what he felt most strongly about the war was the slavery it led to, the scorn of officers for the ordinary soldiers, treating them as animals; the army was a huge machine aimed at keeping men in obedience for organised slaughter.

==Books==
This wartime writing was the beginning of a prolific output and over a variety of subjects.  The first works to be published were  &quot;Quatre-vingt un chapitres sur l’Esprit et les Passions,&quot; in 1917, and &quot;Système des Beaux-Arts&quot;,  in 1920. In fact, he&#x27;d written two academic books before the war, before he had adopted his pseudonym: his thesis at the &quot;Ecole Normale&quot;  on the Stoics, and a published volume on Spinoza. The first major work of the post-war years was &quot;Les Idées et les Ages,&quot; published in two volumes in 1926. Apart from the several collections of &quot;propos&quot;, there followed many books, including works on philosophy, Plato, Stendhal, Balzac, and Charles Dickens. In 1934 came a second major work, on religion, &quot;Les Dieux&quot; (translated as &quot;The Gods&quot;), followed two years late by his intellectual autobiography, &quot;Histoire de mes pensées&quot;.  André Comte-Sponville has described his later work as ‘the finest prose of ideas of the century’.

==Later life and World War Two==
Through the thirties Alain was politically active as a prominent pacifist; in 1934 he was a co-founder of the &quot;Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascists.&quot; After retirement from teaching, many publications followed, with books published every year.

But he was also struggling against illness, which confined him to a wheelchair, as the second world war started. His spirits revived with his marriage in December 1945 to Gabrielle Landormy, twenty years his junior, and with whom he had fallen in love nearly forty years before.

== A controversy ==
In his youth Alain was a supporter of Dreyfus; he had many Jewish friends and pupils. Yet, when in 2018 his &quot;Journal Inédit&quot; &quot;1937-1950&quot; was published, a highly selective reading identified certain remarks as being anti-Semitic and, further, led to the accusation that Alain was himself an anti-Semite. Some of these remarks do now make uncomfortable reading, but they also need to be understood in context. As Alain wrote in 1938 “I would like to rid myself of anti-Semitism, but I can’t achieve this” (28/1/38). He was writing in a private journal, not for publication, a place to try out and reflect on his ideas. In 1943 he was able to make another remark that was not picked up by the commentators, “Fortunately anti-Semitism will finish … it’s unfortunate that I ever tolerated this cruel madness (19/9/1943), and in 1947: “In my eyes equality is like the air we breathe. There’s a huge injustice in even doubting equality of rights. And we must pounce upon the thought that a Jew doesn’t have all these rights.” It&#x27;s not surprising that, as a philosopher, he became aware of his prejudice;  it was a weakness to be overcome, not a prejudice upon which to act. There is no trace of anti-Semitism in his published writings.

==Death==
Alain died June 2, 1951, in his home on the outskirts of Paris. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

== Philosophy ==
Alain did not develop a system; like most French philosophers of his generation he distrusted systems, even though, contrary to most of his colleagues, he did show a deep interest in studying systematic philosophers. He was an early (and quite unique) commentator of Hegel, a thorough and favourable critic of Hamelin, an admirer of Comte, three of the greatest systematic thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Despite the presence of his closely argued philosophical books, Alain is perhaps best placed in a tradition of French thinkers like Montaigne and Pascal. This comparison, favoured by André Maurois, was vigorously challenged by Georges Canguilhem who saw in this a way of denying “Alain his dignity as a philosopher.”  In the end, Alain&#x27;s thought is a typically modern one, which expresses itself in a fragmented way and for which truth is always local, precarious and constantly to be revised. Its coherence is, nevertheless, undeniable and features deep understanding of previous philosophers, from Plato through Descartes to Hegel and Comte, which correlates with the unity of his ideas, and its expression in certain regular themes.

Alain is probably best known for his views on politics which argue for a radical liberalism concerned with the role of the citizen in a democracy.  His was the first attempt at political engagement by a philosopher in the name of philosophy. A man of the left, but without any ideology, distrustful of ideology, he defends the rights of individuals and their freedom to think and act. The role of the citizen was summed up in a paradox: to both obey and resist: that is, obey the laws but resist power by all legitimate means. Alain remained a firm defender of democracy; on the international front, he was an untiring defender of peace.

This emphasis on individual freedom runs throughout his writing. “I have not thought about anything as much as about freedom of judgement”. He liked the play on words in French of ‘penser, c’est peser’ – to think is to weigh. This can be expanded through a definition he gave of ‘mind’ (&quot;esprit)&quot;: “which is at bottom the power of doubt, which is to raise oneself above all mechanisms, order, virtues, duties, dogmas, to judge them, subordinate them, and replace them by freedom, which only owes anything to itself.” This link between the freedom of the mind and the freedom of the individual can be seen as providing the opening scene to the Existentialism of the 1940s associated with Sartre, de Beauvoir and Camus.

He had a sophisticated theory of perception, influenced by Kant and Lagneau, that emphasized the role of the mind in perception, that the world is only grasped through ideas. And also a theory of the imagination, for which Alain claimed some originality and with which Sartre engaged in both &quot;L’Imagination&quot; (1936) and  &quot;L’Imaginaire&quot; (1940). 

His later works, principally &quot;Les Dieux,&quot; discussed religion. Though no longer a believer, Alain brings out the force of the human expression in religion, mainly in paganism and Christianity, where he admires the figure of Christ as a rejection of power and force.

Overall, the aim of his philosophy was to teach reflection and rational thought, avoiding prejudices. “To think is to say no. Note that the sign for yes is that of a person falling asleep; while to wake up is to shake the head and say no.” A humanist Cartesian, he is an ‘awakener of the mind’, passionate for liberty.

<text>USS &quot;Ross&quot; (DDG-71) is the 21st &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy and is the last of the Flight I variant. She is the second Navy ship to be named &quot;Ross&quot;, the first Navy ship named for Medal of Honor recipient Donald K. Ross. The first &quot;Ross&quot;, , was named for David Ross, a captain in the Continental Navy.

==Construction==
&quot;Ross&quot; was the 10th ship of her class to be built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was laid down on 10 April 1995; launched on 22 March 1996; sponsored by Mrs. Helen L. Ross, widow of the late Captain Ross; and commissioned on 28 June 1997, at Galveston, Texas, Commander Jeffrey R. Ginnow in command.

==Service history==
After commissioning, &quot;Ross&quot; set sail for a Combat Systems Ship Qualification Trial, which lasted six weeks, and then sailed back to Pascagoula for three months for her Post Shakedown Availability (PSA). She was then returned to her homeport of Portsmouth, Virginia, and completed the Basic Training Phase: Engineering Certification, CART II, TSTA I, and III, Cruise Missile Tactical Qualification, Final Evaluation Period (FEP), and Logistics Management Assessment.

&quot;Ross&quot; completed her Intermediate Training Phase and set sail early in 1999 as part of Carrier Group 8, led by . The group sortied for a Joint Task Force Exercise to prepare for an upcoming six-month deployment set to commence on 26 March 1999. During this deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea &quot;Ross&quot; participated in Operation Allied Force. On 22 September, she returned to Naval Station Norfolk.

On 15 May 2000, she set sail for Northern Europe in order to participate in the Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 2000. She served as the flagship for the Commander of Carrier Group Eight, and together with the destroyer operated with more than 50 ships from the numerous European countries. During these exercises &quot;Ross&quot; visited Stockholm, Sweden, and Kiel, Germany, before returning to the United States in late June.

On 16 October 2001, &quot;Ross&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and conducting operations in support of the U.N. resolutions against Iraq. During this deployment, &quot;Ross&quot; was again part of the &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Battle Group.

On 11 September 2001, &quot;Ross&quot; was underway on a three-hour notice in response to the September 11 attacks, acting temporarily as a Regional Air Defense Commander in support of Commander, North American Air Defense Command. &quot;Ross&quot; was also recognized that year with the Arizona Memorial Trophy for being the most combat ready ship in the US Navy.

On 6 June 2005, a .50 caliber machine gun on her deck fired while leaving a shipyard. The single .50 caliber bullet struck a nearby barge and two washing machines within the barge. The gun was discharged while performing a check on its firing operation.

Later in 2005, &quot;Ross&quot; participated in UNITAS 47-06 in place of the cruiser due to the damage to Pascagoula created by Hurricane Katrina. &quot;Ross&quot; enjoyed liberty in Curaçao, St. Maarten, and Rio de Janeiro, while participating in the multi-ship exercise with naval forces from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Spain, and Uruguay. During the return home, &quot;Ross&quot; encountered heavy seas at high speeds resulting in a tear in her hull. The crew isolated her flooding and performed de-watering during the remainder of the journey up the Atlantic coast eventually arriving in Norfolk in time for Thanksgiving.

In 2006, &quot;Ross&quot; returned from a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1. She conducted over 850 vessel queries, commanded over 17 ships from various nations, performed over 40 helicopter landings and takeoffs and 41 port visits to six countries and 14 ports. From 1 May 2006 to 7 November 2006, &quot;Ross&quot; traveled over . In Alicante, Spain, in August 2006, &quot;Ross&quot; became the group flagship, embarking the American commander of the standing maritime group. Her mission was to perform as part of Operation Active Endeavour; deterring terrorism, smuggling and human trafficking in the Mediterranean.

In September 2014, responding to turmoil in Ukraine, the US Navy announced that a guided missile destroyer had entered the Black Sea in order to participate with Ukrainian ships in the naval exercise &quot;Sea Breeze&quot;. &quot;Ross&quot; &quot;serves to demonstrate the United States&#x27; commitment to strengthening the collective security of NATO allies and partners in the region,&quot; the Navy said in a press release.

In November 2014, three sailors from &quot;Ross&quot; were attacked while ashore in the port of Istanbul, apparently by members of the Turkey Youth Union.

In May 2015, &quot;Ross&quot; was buzzed by a pair of Russian Su-24 Fencers at a distance of while the ship was on-station in the Black Sea. Russian Federation State media RIA Novosti quoted a military source, which claimed that &quot;Ross&quot; had acted aggressively and was scared away by the bombers. The US Navy published a statement, denying the Russian claims and pointing out that the ship was in international waters and did not deviate from its operations.

On 21 October 2015, &quot;Ross&quot; intercepted a Terrier missile as part of ASD-15 anti-ballistic missile testing in the North Sea. &quot;Ross&quot; spent the summer of 2017 conducting anti-submarine patrols around the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic Ocean.

On 7 April 2017, &quot;Ross&quot; and , from their positions in the Eastern Mediterranean, fired a total of 59 Tomahawk missiles at specific military targets at the Shayrat airfield in Syria. The missile barrage was in response to the death of at least 80 civilians in the immediate aftermath of 4 April 2017, Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in Idlib province, an attack that the US government concluded was launched by the Syrian regime, from Shayrat.

On 16 February 2018, &quot;Ross&quot; joined in the Black Sea for an &quot;unspecified regional proactive presence mission&quot;. The move follows increased tensions between Russia and the U.S. after American federal prosecutors announced indictments against 13 Russian citizens for their alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.

In December 2019, &quot;Ross&quot; arrived in Odesa, Ukraine, on Christmas Eve, part of its mission in the Black Sea. &quot;Ross&quot; is the first U.S. vessel to stop in Odesa since the USS Porter made a port call there in October.

On 6 September 2022, &quot;Ross&quot; departed Rota and began her journey to Norfolk for a scheduled port shift. She was relieved by .

==Upgrades==
On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that &quot;Ross&quot; would be upgraded during Fiscal Year 2012 to RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) capability in order to function as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.

In 2016, four destroyers patrolling with the U.S. 6th Fleet based in Naval Station Rota, Spain, including &quot;Ross&quot; received self-protection upgrades, replacing the aft Phalanx CIWS 20mm Vulcan cannon with the SeaRAM 11-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher. The SeaRam uses the same sensor dome as the Phalanx. This was the first time the close-range ship defense system was paired with an Aegis ship. All four ships to receive the upgrade were either Flight I or II, meaning they originally had two Phalanx CIWS systems when launched.

== Coat of arms ==
=== Shield ===
The shield is in the shape of a octagon with a gold background and blue trim. The center of the shield consists of an inverted silver star, anchor and crossing red lightning bolts.

The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The anchor represents the anchorage at Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into World War II after being attacked 7 December 1941.

<text>The Clatsop (Lower Chinook: ) are a Chinookan-speaking Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest of the United States. In the early 19th century they inhabited an area of the northwestern coast of present-day Oregon from the mouth of the Columbia River south to Tillamook Head, Oregon. Today, Clatsop descendants are members of the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, as well as the unrecognized Chinook Indian Nation and Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes.

==Etymology==
The name Clatsop comes from , meaning &quot;those who have pounded salmon&quot;. It was originally the name of a single settlement, later applied to the tribe as a whole.

Clatsop has also been spelled Clapsott, Clapsot, Clotsop, Cladsap, Clatsap, Clatsup, Klatsup, and Latsop.

The Clatsop were also called by the Lower Chinook and Kathlamet , meaning &quot;where there is pounded salmon&quot;, deriving from the main Clatsop village, .

== Classification ==
The Clatsop are a Chinookan people. Alongside the Willapa Chinook and the Chinook proper, they are one of the Lower Chinook, a cultural-geographical and linguistic grouping of Chinookans whose villages were at the mouth of the Columbia River. The Columbia River in Chinook is called or , &#x27;great water&#x27;. In Chinook Jargon, it is called .

== Territory ==
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Clatsop occupied an area on the south bank of the Columbia River stretching from Point Adams to Youngs Bay. They also had villages on the Pacific coast stretching from Point Adams to Tillamook Head.

To the north of the Clatsop, across the Columbia River, were the villages of the Chinook, and to the east were the Kathlamet, another Chinookan people. To the south, past Tillamook Head, was the territory of the Nehalem, a Salishan-speaking group to which the Clatsop have strong ties.
==History==
The Chinookans at the mouth of the river were first mentioned by Robert Gray and his first mate, John Boit, who visited the area on May 18, 1792. Soon after on October 21, the Vancouver expedition visited the area, venturing past the Columbia Bar. The Vancouver expedition described a village at Point Adams, noting the presence of burial canoes.

The first major European account to describe the Clatsop was the account of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805. The expedition arrived in the fall and wintered in Youngs Bay. The expedition named their last encampment Fort Clatsop after the tribe, whose nearest major village was approximately away. According to the journals of William Clark, the Clatsop comprised about 200 people living in three separate villages, with large longhouses constructed of cedar planks. Clatsop members regularly visited the fort to trade furs and other goods for European manufactured goods. The Clatsop shared salmon, berries, and hunting tips with the Corps of Discovery. In contrast to the Corps&#x27; interactions with the Plains Indians the previous winter, their interaction with the Clatsop was more limited. The two groups did not mingle for social occasions, and the fort was opened to trading only 24 days during the winter. Part of the reason may have been that the coastal tribes had an existing relationship with British traders. The Clatsop and Chinook asked for higher prices from the American expedition for their goods at a time when the Corps&#x27; supply of &quot;Indian gifts&quot; had dwindled. Only two Clatsop, Coboway and Cuscalar, are regularly named in the Corps members&#x27; journals.

The arrival of European traders to the Columbia River in the early 19th century allowed the Clatsop and other downriver Chinookans to obtain trade goods otherwise locked behind the long inland trade routes controlled by the upriver Chinookans, their historic rivals.

From the 1830s-1850s, Clatsop society began experiencing a rapid decline after smallpox, measles, malaria, and other diseases ravaged the Columbia River. As the fur trade had become less important to Americans, the Clatsop had to adapt to these quickly changing conditions. Villages were abandoned and populations consolidated together, as tribes began to attempt to negotiate with the American government.

In an 1851 treaty, the Clatsop tribe proposed to cede 90 percent of their land to the U.S. Government. This treaty was one of many in the Northwest that was never ratified by Senate. Unlike other tribes, the members were not required to move to a reservation. They were one of the only tribes in Oregon that were not the focus of an organized effort to remove them from reservations.

By the late 19th century, traditional Clatsop society as it was at the beginning of the century was all but gone. Many Clatsop by this point had merged with their southern neighbors, the Tillamook, and adopted the Tillamook language.

== Culture and society ==
The Clatsop had designated headmen but were socially flexible. Individual families affiliated with one another in small villages and seasonal camps located near food sources.

=== Language ===
The Clatsop spoke a dialect of the Lower Chinookan language, which is now extinct. Most Clatsops spoke Chinook Jargon by the time Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Corps of Discovery made contact with them. Some spoke Nehalem, reflecting intermarriage and cohabitation with that tribe.

Chinook Jargon is a trade language and was once used throughout much of the Pacific Northwest. Many place names in the area come from the Chinook Jargon, for example, Ecola Creek and Park — &quot;whale&quot;.

== Successor groups ==

=== Chinook Indian Nation ===
The Chinook Indian Nation is an unregocnized group which claims descent from the Clatsop people. In January 2001, the Chinook Indian Nation gained official federal recognition through an executive order by President Bill Clinton. The Chinook&#x27;s legal status was reversed by the Bush administration soon after taking office. The of the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 2004–2006 provided renewed interest in the status of the Clatsop and Chinook.

=== Clatsop-Nehalem ===
The Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes are an unrecognized group who claim descent from the Clatsop people. The Confederated Tribes have approximately 200 members. The confederation formed between the Clatsop and their southern neighbors, the Salishan-speaking Nehalem.

In May 2020, the North Coast Land Conservancy transferred of its Neawanna Point Habitat Preserve, located on the north Oregon coast, to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. The area, located between Seaside and Gearhart, Oregon, consists of saltmarsh and Sitka spruce forest on the Necanicum Estuary at the north end of Seaside. The Neawanna and the Neacoxie creeks meet the Necanicum River, which flows to the Pacific. The Clatsop had known this area by the name &quot;&quot; or &quot;place of little pines&quot;. This is the first land owned by the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes since they were displaced by European Americans beginning nearly 200 years ago.

=== Others ===
Other tribes in the region, such as the Quinault, Siletz, and Grand Ronde, also have enrollees of Clatsop descent.

In her early childhood, she lived in many of the Southern United States due to her father&#x27;s job as a traveling salesman. At the age of 15, she and her parents moved to Philadelphia. They stayed there a year or so before settling in New York City, where she began attending the Alviene School of Dramatic Art. 

Because of her strong resemblance to actress Lillian Gish, Merkel was offered a part as Gish&#x27;s youngest sister in a silent film called &quot;World Shadows&quot;. However, the funding for the film dried up and it was never completed. Merkel went on to appear in a few silent movies, several of them for the Lee Bradford Corporation. She also appeared in the two-reel &quot;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song&quot; (1923), which was made by Lee de Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process and starred Louis Wolheim and Helen Weir. Not making much of a mark in films, Merkel turned her attention to the theater and found work in several important plays on Broadway. Her biggest triumph was in &quot;Coquette&quot; (1927), which starred her idol, Helen Hayes. 

Invited to Hollywood by famous director D. W. Griffith to play Ann Rutledge in his film &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1930), Merkel became a big success in sound films. During the 1930s, she became a popular second lead in a number of films, usually playing the wisecracking best friend of the heroine, supporting actresses such as Jean Harlow, Carole Lombard, Loretta Young, and Eleanor Powell.

Merkel was known for her Kewpie-doll looks, strong Southern accent, and wry line delivery. She played Sam Spade&#x27;s secretary in the original 1931 version of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. Merkel was a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player from 1932 to 1938, appearing in as many as 12 films in a year, often on loan-out to other studios. She was also often cast as leading lady opposite Jack Benny, Harold Lloyd, Franchot Tone, and Charles Butterworth, among others.

In &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933), Merkel played a streetwise show girl. In the famous &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot; number, Merkel and Ginger Rogers sang the verse: &quot;Matrimony is baloney. She&#x27;ll be wanting alimony in a year or so./Still they go and shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.&quot; Merkel appeared in both the 1934 and the 1952 film versions of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, playing different roles. She received second billing in &quot;The Good Old Soak&quot; (1937) with Wallace Beery and Ted Healy in the same year that Healy died mysteriously.

One of her most famous roles was in the Western comedy &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939), in which her character, Lily Belle, gets into a famous &quot;cat-fight&quot; with Frenchie (Marlene Dietrich) over the possession of her husband&#x27;s trousers, won by Frenchie in a crooked card game. She played the elder daughter to the W. C. Fields character, Egbert Sousé, in the 1940 film &quot;The Bank Dick&quot;. Her film career went into decline during the 1940s, although she continued working in smaller productions and in radio as Adeline Fairchild on The Great Gildersleeve. In 1950, she starred with William Bendix in the baseball comedy &quot;Kill the Umpire&quot;, which was a surprise hit.

She made a comeback as a middle-aged woman playing mothers and maiden aunts, and in 1956 won a Tony Award for her role on Broadway in &quot;The Ponder Heart&quot;, adapted from the novella of the same name. She had a major part in the MGM 1959 film &quot;The Mating Game&quot; as Paul Douglas&#x27;s character&#x27;s wife and Debbie Reynolds&#x27; character&#x27;s mother, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961). She was also featured as Brian Keith&#x27;s character&#x27;s housekeeper, Verbena, in the Walt Disney comedy &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; in 1961. Her final film role was opposite Elvis Presley in &quot;Spinout&quot; (1966).

==Personal life==
On March 5, 1945, Merkel was nearly killed when her mother Bessie, with whom she shared an apartment in New York City, died by suicide by gassing herself. Merkel was overcome by the five gas jets her mother had turned on in their kitchen and was found unconscious in her bedroom.

On March 4, 1952, seven years almost to the day after her mother died, Merkel overdosed on sleeping pills. She was found unconscious by a nurse who was caring for her at the time and remained in a coma for a day before recovering.

Merkel was a lifelong Methodist.

===Marriage===
Merkel was married once and had no children. She married North American Aviation executive Ronald L. Burla in 1932. They separated in April 1944. Merkel filed for divorce on December 19, 1946, in Miami, and it was granted in March 1947.

==Death==
On January 2, 1986, Merkel died in Los Angeles at the age of 82. She is buried near her parents, Arno and Bessie Merkel, in Highland Cemetery in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Una Merkel has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (6230 Hollywood Boulevard). In 1991, a historical marker was dedicated to her in her hometown of Covington.

<text>Rafael Altamira y Crevea (February 10, 1866 – June 1, 1951) was a Spanish historian and jurist.

Born in Alicante, Altamira is considered to be one of the most significant Spanish historians of the 20th century, was a multi-faceted scholar who also took interest in journalism, pedagogy, politics, and literature. Written as a manual for Spanish history, no other work has pictured the Spanish ethos so graphically as Rafael Altamira&#x27;s &quot;Historia de España y de la Civilización Española&quot; (Barcelona, 1899).

In 1898 Altamira, together with other professors of the Law School at the University of Oviedo, established the University Extension as a different area of the university structure. Its main goal was to spread the knowledge created by the universities by means of conferences, courses, and other activities to those social classes that did not have access to it. These professors were following the example set by several English universities that had already been put into practice in other European countries such as Germany and Belgium. 

Altamira gave courses and conferences in many universities both in Spain and abroad (Argentina, Peru, USA, France, England, etc.). He was also a justice of The Hague Tribunal, in the Netherlands, where he concentrated his efforts on working for peace and international dialogue. For his work and career he was nominated as candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933. The same year, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="765377" wikidata="Q7048616" url="?curid=765377" title="Nominative absolute">
<text>In English grammar, a nominative absolute is an absolute, the term coming from Latin for &quot;loosened from&quot; or &quot;separated&quot;, part of a sentence, functioning as a sentence modifier (usually at the beginning or end of the sentence). It provides an additional information about the main subject and verb. Its analogues are the ablative absolute in Latin, the genitive absolute in Greek, or the locative absolute in Sanskrit.

A noun in the common case or a pronoun in the nominative case is joined with a predicate that does not include a finite verb.

One way to identify a nominative absolute is to add a conjunction and a verb: one can often (though not always) create a subordinate clause out of a nominative absolute by adding a subordinating conjunction (such as &quot;because&quot; or &quot;when&quot;) and a form of the verb &quot;to be&quot;.

<text>Werner Emmanuel Bachmann (November 13, 1901 – March 22, 1951) was an American chemist. Bachmann was born in Detroit, Michigan where he studied chemistry and chemical engineering at Wayne State University and later at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor nearby. He completed his doctorate under Moses Gomberg and spent the rest of his academic career at the University of Michigan.

Bachmann studied physical organic chemistry (rearrangements, free radicals) and organic synthesis. He is considered a pioneer in steroid synthesis, and carried out the first total synthesis of a steroidal hormone, equilenin with Alfred L. Wilds. His name is associated with the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction for the synthesis of diaryl compounds from aryl diazonium chlorides.

Bachmann developed a new method for the production of the explosive RDX, which was used by the United States during World War II.

<text>USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DDG-72) is the 22nd &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight II) Aegis guided missile destroyer currently in service with the United States Navy and is the first of the Flight II variant. This ship is the 22nd destroyer of her class. USS &quot;Mahan&quot; was the 12th ship of this class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, and construction began on 17 August 1995. She was launched and christened on 29 June 1996. On 14 February 1998 she was commissioned in Tampa, Florida. &quot;Mahan&quot; is homeported in Norfolk, Virginia, and as of 2012 was attached to Destroyer Squadron 2. By 2016, the ship was part of Destroyer Squadron 22.

==Namesake==
She is named for seapower naval theorist Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan USN (1840-1914) and is the fourth Navy ship to bear the name. Mahan served with the Union&#x27;s blockading squadrons during the American Civil War, and served as President of the Naval War College for two terms. Furthermore, he was a renowned U.S. Naval theoretician and is best known as the author of the book &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;, which, with his other scholarly works, continues to influence strategic and geopolitical thinking throughout the world.

==Service history==
The keel of &quot;Mahan&quot; was laid on 17 August 1995. Her mast was stepped on 6 February 1996, and she was launched and christened later that year on 29 June. The ship&#x27;s sponsor is Mrs. Jennie Lou Arthur, wife of Admiral Stan Arthur. Her Aegis Combat System was lit off on 19 December.

1997 was a busy year for &quot;Mahan&quot;. Alpha/Bravo trials occurred on 21 July, Charlie trials on 5 August, and Delta trials on 12 August. The ship was officially transferred to the Navy on 22 August, and her Crew moved aboard on 17 October.

The ship’s first underway was 16–17 January 1998 from Bath, Maine, to Portland, Maine, for a three-day port visit. The weather was particularly heavy, and many of the crew members who had not put to sea before felt the effects of seasickness. Underway from Portland on 21 January, the ship pulled into her new homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, on 24 January. &quot;Mahan&quot; stayed in Norfolk until departing for her commissioning ceremony.

&quot;Mahan&quot; was commissioned at 1100 on 14 February 1998 at Tampa, Florida by the Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic, Vice Admiral Henry C. Griffin, III, USN with Commander Michael L. James, USN, commanding. Distinguished guests included Mr. Allen Cameron, President of Bath Iron Works, the Hon. Charles T. Canady, Congressman from Florida’s 12th District, and the Hon. George Nethercutt, Congressman from Washington’s 5th District. &quot;Mahan&quot; stayed in Tampa until 17 February, returning to Norfolk on 21 February. &quot;Mahan&quot; briefly left at the end of the month to conduct Combat Direction Finding System testing at sea.

The next few months saw events including Command Assessment of Readiness and Training (CART), ammunition onload at Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, Tailored Ship’s Training Availability (TSTA), Industrial Hygiene Survey, Combat Systems Ship’s Qualification Trial (CSSQT), evaluation at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), MISSILEX, Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) qualification, VANDALEX, Final Conduct Trial, a post-Shipyard Availability Conference, and a recruiting video shoot, all before the end of July. In August, &quot;Mahan&quot; hosted the change of command ceremony for Commander Destroyer Squadron 26.

&quot;Mahan&quot; was placed in drydock in Portland, Maine on 1 September as part of the post-Shipyard Availability (PSA). &quot;Mahan&quot; departed Portland on 16 November, and during the transit back to Norfolk, conducted her first underway replenishment, with . The ship was underway twice for Helicopter Deck Landing Qualifications (DLQs) before the end of the year.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Mahan&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

In June 2009, &quot;Mahan&quot; participated as an opposition force unit during &#x27;s Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX).

In July 2009, &quot;Mahan&quot; participated in Operation Northern Trident, where she met two Royal Australian Navy ships, and , in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The three ships conducted combined exercises at sea and a four-day port visit to New York City, New York. &quot;Mahan&quot; crew members worked with their Australian counterparts in cleaning the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines Center in midtown Manhattan. Receptions were held onboard all three ships while offering tours to the public. Crew members were able to pay their respects by conducting a wreath laying ceremony at the World Trade Center. Several sailors also reenlisted in Times Square and at the World Trade Center site.

USS &quot;Mahan&quot; began a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) at the BAE Systems Ship Repair shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia on 6 January 2010. The extensive upgrades and installations received during this time focused on improving the ship&#x27;s Command and Control capability. &quot;Mahan&quot; left the shipyard on 10 March, and completed a light-off assessment on 25 March, ending the SRA. The remainder of 2010 was dedicated to completing Basic Phase training, which had commenced prior to starting the SRA in 2009, conducting Integrated Phase training, and final repairs and installations to ensure &quot;Mahan&quot; was materially ready for an extended deployment. &quot;Mahan&quot; participated in the Amphibious Readiness Group&#x27;s COMPTUEX in July, resulting in certification for maritime support operations. &quot;Mahan&quot;″s executive officer was relieved on 17 September 2010 following an investigation and commodore&#x27;s mast.

In August 2011, USS &quot;Mahan&quot; made a port visit to Rockland, Maine, in support of the 64th annual Maine Lobster Festival. The crew participated in a parade, tours, a cooking contest, community service projects, and a 10K race. Later that month, &quot;Mahan&quot; visited Newport, Rhode Island to be the Surface Warfare Officer&#x27;s School (SWOS) Ship for the week of 15–19 August. &quot;Mahan&quot; was sortied along with 26 other ships in preparation for Hurricane Irene, returning 1 September 2011. &quot;Mahan&quot; began a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) at the Marine Hydraulics International shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia, on 26 October 2011. During this availability, the ship received the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System upgrade. Commander Adam Aycock relieved Commander Kurt Mondlak as commanding officer on 4 November 2011.

USS &quot;Mahan&quot;″s SRA ended on 29 February 2012, which was immediately followed by a light-off assessment and sea trials. The ship went through four Continuous Maintenance Availabilities (CMAVs) in April, June, September, and November. Following a command investigation, 13 &quot;Mahan&quot; sailors were awarded non-judicial punishment for illegal drug use during a captain&#x27;s mast on 4 April 2012. On 10 April 2012, &quot;Mahan&quot; hosted a retired Chief Sonar Technician. In June and July, &quot;Mahan&quot; hosted midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps as part of Cortramid. In October, &quot;Mahan&quot; was evaluated by the Board of Inspection and Survey as part of a regularly scheduled inspection. Not only was &quot;Mahan&quot; the first ship to successfully demonstrate Ballistic Missile Defense during the inspection, the ship also achieved the highest score for a destroyer in several years. Later in October, &quot;Mahan&quot; was the host ship for the United States Naval Academy Homecoming Weekend in Annapolis, Maryland. The ship completed Independent Deployer Certification Exercise (IDCERTEX) in December in preparation for her upcoming deployment.

USS &quot;Mahan&quot; held a memorial ceremony on 6 December 2013, in honor of the 69th anniversary of the Battle of Ormoc Bay in which USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DD-364) lost six crewmembers. On 10 January 2014, three USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DDG-72) sailors traveled to Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, to present a flag to a veteran of USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DD-364) who was unable to make the December ceremony.

USS &quot;Mahan&quot; visited New Orleans, Louisiana, during the 2014 Mardi Gras celebration.

A shooting occurred on the ship just before midnight on 24 March 2014, while the ship was pier-side at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia. Master-At-Arms Second Class Mark Mayo who was on duty as the Chief of the Guard, dove in front of the ship&#x27;s Petty Officer of the Watch to shield her from the gunman. For his actions, he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal. Mayo was killed and the civilian suspect was shot and killed by Naval Security Forces. The civilian armed himself by wrestling the weapon free from a Norfolk Naval Station Guard.

According to the officials speaking anonymously to Reuters, a helicopter dropped a smoke float and the destroyer launched flares but the boats continued at speed. A similar incident occurred on 24 April 2017.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has background of dark blue with a blue trim. The center of the shield shows a gauntlet wielding a trident and a torch.&quot;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The trident at the center of the shield symbolizes the ship&#x27;s warfare capabilities while underscoring the importance of a strong navy. The gauntlet and torch are adapted from USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DD-364)&#x27;s emblem highlighting the ship’s namesake, Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, as the father of all modern navies. The tines of the trident represent the three previous ships named &quot;Mahan&quot;, and the Officer, Chief Petty Officer, and Enlisted Corps of personnel which man the ship.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a red compass enclosed in a gold annulet surrounded by a wreath.&quot; The central star commemorates the second USS &quot;Mahan&quot;″s World War II battle honors (five battle stars), earned before she was sunk by kamikazes. The twelve small stars on the annulet denote the battle stars of the third USS &quot;Mahan&quot; (DDG-42) for service in the Vietnam War. The unfurled scroll underscores &quot;Mahan&quot; as the author of &quot;The Influence of Sea Power Upon History&quot;. The compass rose and annulet represent &quot;Mahan&quot;″s influence of sea power, its strategy and geopolitical importance worldwide. The wreath combines laurel and palm to symbolize honor and victory.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of blue that has a gold reverse side.&quot;The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;Built to Fight.&quot; The motto was chosen as a remembrance of Admiral Arleigh Burke in memory of his contributions to the U.S. Navy. During USS &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;″s commissioning, Admiral Burke issued a challenge to his sailors: “This ship is built to fight; you’d better know how.”

=== Seal ===
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS MAHAN&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 72&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<doc id="765384" wikidata="Q1637993" url="?curid=765384" title="USS McFaul">
<text>USS &quot;McFaul&quot; (DDG-74) is the 24th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight II) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy. She is named for U.S. Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer Donald L. McFaul. USS &quot;McFaul&quot; was the 11th ship of this class to be built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and construction began on 26 January 1996. She was launched on 18 January 1997 and was christened on 12 April 1997. On 25 April 1998 she had her commissioning ceremony at the Garden City Terminal in Savannah, Georgia. As of July 2020 the ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 26 based out of Naval Station Norfolk.

==Service history==
On 22 August 2005, &quot;McFaul&quot; was involved in a minor collision with the destroyer off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. Both ships suffered minor damage, and no injuries were reported. Both ships returned to their homeport at Naval Station Norfolk under their own power.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;McFaul&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.
On 24 August 2008, &quot;McFaul&quot; arrived in Batumi, Georgia, as part of Operation Assured Delivery to &quot;deliver humanitarian relief supplies ... as part of the larger United States response to the government of Georgia request for humanitarian assistance&quot; in the wake of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. &quot;McFaul&quot; offloaded nearly of supplies—including hygiene items, baby food and care supplies, bottled water, and milk—donated by the United States Agency for International Development.

On 5 April 2010, &quot;McFaul&quot; responded to a distress call from the merchant vessel MV &quot;Rising Sun&quot; after she was attacked by pirates. &quot;McFaul&quot; was able to neutralize the threat, and captured ten suspected pirates and successfully rescued eight crewmembers from on board a dhow near Salalah, Oman. The pirates were then transferred to the destroyer for a week before they were transferred back to &quot;McFaul&quot; where 30 days later they were turned over to the Somali Transitional Federal Government for subsequent prosecution.

On 12 September 2012, &quot;McFaul&quot; was ordered to the coast of Libya in what the Pentagon called a &quot;contingency&quot; in case a strike was ordered. This was in response to the 2012 diplomatic missions attacks.

On 5 July 2023, &quot;McFaul&quot; interrupted and prevented the attempted seizure of two commercial tankers in the Gulf of Oman. In two incidents, three hours apart, Iranian naval vessels closed on the tankers — and, according to the U.S. Navy, in the second incident, fired upon the tanker. In both cases, the Iranian vessels departed the scene upon the arrival of &quot;McFaul&quot;. The Navy released aerial video of the incidents. Iran&#x27;s government claimed that one of the targeted ships had been involved in a collision and that there was an Iranian court order to seize the ship. Chevron, the company managing the vessel, stated that the ship was not involved in a collision and that they had received no notice regarding any legal proceedings.

<doc id="765390" wikidata="Q372843" url="?curid=765390" title="Dubstar">
<text>Dubstar are an English indie-dance duo, performing songs with hints of Britpop, dream pop and synth, as well as the occasional pop ballad and guitar-laden rock with industrial twists. The group was formed in 1992 by Steve Hillier and Chris Wilkie in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Sarah Blackwood joined in 1993 as vocalist.

&quot;Stars&quot;, the best-selling single by Dubstar, received a great deal of play time in clubs. Many remixes were also created of this song and it was covered by metal band Lacuna Coil on their 2000 EP &quot;Halflife&quot;.

==Career==
Formerly known as The Joans, Dubstar were initially a two-piece band, with Chris Wilkie playing guitar and Steve Hillier singing and playing keyboards. Gavin Lee joined The Joans in the autumn of 1992 and played drums and, later, bass guitar before leaving to pursue a career at British Airways the following year. Performance artist and musician Mark Greenwood also played bass in The Joans for a number gigs in the summer of 1992. Sarah Blackwood was invited to join the band in August 1993, after her boyfriend accidentally left a cassette tape of her singing in Steve Hillier&#x27;s flat in Jesmond, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Blackwood replaced Hillier on vocals in early 1994.

Dubstar appointed Darlington-based record producer and talent manager Graeme Robinson as their manager after Robinson had seen them play in a sparsely attended Newcastle club in March 1994. Robinson renamed the band and provided studio time and produced independent demos of seventeen songs which he brought to the attention of former &quot;Sounds&quot; journalist, Andy Ross, who promptly signed the band to his Camden-based label, Food Records. Ross engaged the services of Pet Shop Boys and New Order producer Stephen Hague to co-produce a number of tracks with Robinson for their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Disgraceful&quot; (1995), and commissioned an advertising campaign featuring Robert Steel&#x27;s controversial &quot;pencil case vulva&quot; artwork. The album charted well on release in July 1995, and by January 1996 Dubstar had arrived in the Top 20 of the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Not So Manic Now&quot; (originally written and recorded by Brick Supply), followed by a re-released &quot;Stars&quot;, which marked Dubstar&#x27;s UK chart zenith.

In June 1997, Dubstar contributed a cover of &quot;Everyday I Die&quot; to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot;. In September, the band released their second UK album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;. The group&#x27;s debut US album, also called &quot;Goodbye&quot;, was released on Polydor Records in 1998 and combined tracks from both the first and second albums. The third original Dubstar album, &quot;Make It Better&quot;, was released in 2000. Hillier quit the band just before its release. EMI released a best-of compilation titled &quot;&quot; in 2004.

In 2002, Blackwood was recruited by ex-Frazier Chorus member Kate Holmes to join her duo Technique, replacing singer Xan Tyler for a European tour with Depeche Mode. Shortly afterwards, Holmes and Blackwood decided to write together and formed a new pseudonymous electropop act, Client (stylised CLIEИT). The duo would not have their faces photographed in promotional photos, with Holmes and Blackwood being referred to Client A and Client B. Client would chart three singles in the UK, with their biggest, &quot;Pornography&quot;, getting to number 22 in 2005.

Posts in 2008 on their official Myspace page stated that the recording of Dubstar&#x27;s fourth album was underway. However, in November 2008 they made a post to their Facebook group stating that Blackwood would not participate, and the future of the album was up in the air. Blackwood and Wilkie have worked together in the interim, as Blackwood&#x27;s first solo album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Acoustic at the Club Bar &amp; Dining&quot;, features Wilkie on guitar; the seven-track live recording was released exclusively online, and consists of acoustic versions of Dubstar and Client songs, plus covers of tracks by The Smiths and New Order.

On 12 April 2010, the band released a cover of &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a German Film Star&quot; for an Amnesty International project. Interviewed by Andrew Collins on BBC 6 Music that afternoon, Blackwood confirmed that the band were back together and would be going into studio to record tracks for a new Dubstar album, although she would continue to also record with Client. However, in December 2010, it was announced that Blackwood had left Client and a new member was being recruited to front that band.

Dubstar released a new single, &quot;Waltz &quot;, on 1 June 2018. Via their website, they revealed that it was taken from a new album titled &quot;One&quot;, due for release on 28 September 2018. The album was produced by Youth and published by the band&#x27;s own label, Northern Writes. The release date was 12 October 2018.

On 27 August 2020, Dubstar released a pandemic-inspired track titled &quot;Hygiene Strip&quot;. A video for the new song was released on the same day. Later in 2020, the duo released the disco-pop track &quot;I Can See You Outside&quot;, which was recorded during the United Kingdom&#x27;s first COVID-19 lockdown and which was co-produced with Stephen Hague.

<doc id="765391" wikidata="Q2984218" url="?curid=765391" title="Wassily de Basil">
<text>Vassily Grigorievich Voskresensky (; 27 July 1951), usually referred to as Colonel Wassily de Basil, was a Russian ballet impresario.

De Basil was born in Kaunas, Russian Empire (now in Lithuania), in 1888 (his year of birth is given alternately as 1880 or 1886). He retired from the Imperial Russian Army as a colonel in the Cossack army, fighting during the First World War in Baku against the Turkish and German forces and was awarded the Order of St. George by his General, Lazar Fedorovich Bicherakhov, himself referred to as the &quot;last soldier of the Empire&quot; by writer, Vlad Olgin. Basil was demobilised from the army in 1919 and worked as a truck driver in Paris before launching himself as a ballet impresario with his first small ballet touring company in 1921. Hiving off the success of Sergei Diaghilev, by 1923 Wassily was doing well enough to hire Olga Smimova and Nikolay Tripolitov as his principal dancers on small tours in France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

It was at this point he adopted a &quot;stage name&quot; Wassily de Basil (essentially Basil de Basil) in 1923 and gave the name of his troupe as &quot;Ballet Russe directed by W. de Basil.&quot;

Following the death of Diaghilev in 1929, the members of his Ballets Russes went in many directions. Around 1925, de Basil partnered with Alexey Tsereteli (also Zereteli) and Ignaty Zon to form the artists agency called Zerbason. In 1929–1930 de Basil&#x27;s ballet troupe acted together with Tsereteli&#x27;s opera troupe. De Basil, Tseretelli and Michel Kachouk, the manager of Feodor Chaliapin, became directors of the Opéra Russe à Paris, a company originally formed by soprano Maria Kousnetsova (also known as Maria Kuznetsova).

De Basil and René Blum, ballet director at the Monte Carlo Opera, along with financier Serge Denham, founded the &quot;Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo&quot; in 1931. The ballet gave its first performance in Monte Carlo on January 11, 1932- the national holiday of Monte Carlo.

Blum and de Basil did not agree artistically, leading to a 1934 split, after which de Basil formed an arrangement with financier Sol Hurok. Col. de Basil initially renamed the company &quot;Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil&quot;.
In 1937, René Blum and former Ballets Russes choreographer Léonide Massine organized a new ballet company and lured away some of de Basil&#x27;s dancers. In addition, Massine sued de Basil in London to regain the intellectual property rights to his own works. He also sued to claim the &quot;Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo&quot; name. The jury decided that de Basil owned Massine&#x27;s ballets created between 1932 and 1937, but not those created before 1932. It also ruled that both successor companies could use the name &quot;Ballet Russe&quot; — but only Massine &amp; Blum&#x27;s company could be called Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. Col. de Basil renamed his company again, as the &quot;Covent Garden Russian Ballet&quot;. In 1939, he gave the company its final name, the Original Ballet Russe.

De Basil brought the Original Ballet Russe on a tour of Australia in 1939–1940, travelling there aboard the P&amp;O ocean liner RMS &quot;Maloja&quot; in September 1938. He had earlier organised tours to Australia in 1936–1937 and 1938–1939, although he did not travel with the company. During his visit to Australia, de Basil commissioned work from Australians, especially from designers, who included Sidney Nolan and Kathleen and Florence Martin. He also instigated a design competition for an original Australian ballet, which was won by Donald Friend with designs for a ballet based on a fictitious event in the life of Ned Kelly.

He directed his Ballet Russe companies, which performed under a variety of different names, until his death in Nice in 1951. All in all, De Basil&#x27;s troupes presented 40 world premieres, and maintained 100 ballets. They gave performances in 600 cities located in 70 countries around the world. His acquisition of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s costumes and sets in 1934 when Massine could not come up with the money, helped De Basil&#x27;s company assume the mantle of leadership in the modern ballet world. He died penniless in a studio apartment with his third wife, Olga Morasova, at his side.

After his death, he joined many of his ballet dancers and comrades in the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, Paris.

<doc id="765394" wikidata="Q1474743" url="?curid=765394" title="USS Higgins">
<text>USS &quot;Higgins&quot; (DDG-76) is the 26th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight II) Aegis guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. She is the 15th of the class to be built by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine. Construction began on 14 November 1996 and she was launched and christened on 4 October 1997. She was commissioned at a ceremony in Port Everglades, Florida on 24 April 1999. She is part of Destroyer Squadron 15 within the Seventh Fleet, and is homeported at United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka in Yokosuka, Japan.

==Namesake==
She is named for William R. Higgins, a Colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps, who was captured, tortured and murdered in 1988 by Hezbollah, during a UN peacekeeping mission to Lebanon. In 1992 he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal, and two years later it was announced that a ship would be named in his honor.

==History==

&quot;Higgins&quot; was built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. The ship was christened on 1 October 1997 by the wife of Colonel Higgins, Lieutenant Colonel Robin L. Higgins, USMC (retired), who is also the ship&#x27;s sponsor. &quot;In the name of all that is good and right in the world - Semper Fi - Always Faithful - I christen thee HIGGINS&quot;.

On 16 August 1999, &quot;Higgins&quot; conducted Spotter Services off San Clemente Island. The following day, &quot;Higgins&quot; shot her first FIREX and earned an amazing 105.92, the highest score on the range that year and the highest in DDG history. &quot;Higgins&quot; score later proved enough to win the Chezek Award for Excellence in Naval Gunnery (the &quot;Top Gun&quot; award), which Vice Admiral Edward Moore Jr. presented to the crew in October.

After a port visit in Hong Kong during her maiden deployment, &quot;Higgins&quot; was the first ship off the coast for the Hainan Island incident that occurred on 1 April 2001, when a United States Navy EP-3E ARIES II signals intelligence aircraft and a People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) J-8II interceptor fighter jet collided in mid-air, resulting in an international dispute between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China on her maiden deployment.

Upon returning to San Diego in April 2004, &quot;Higgins&quot; completed a safe and efficient ordnance offload and fuel transfer and headed into a nine-week Selected Restricted Availability. This time in the shipyard enhanced &quot;Higgins&quot;″ capabilities including the installation of the Tactical Tomahawk weapons system, the refurbishment of the Mk 45/5-inch Lightweight Gun Mount and Mk 41 Vertical Launch systems, and an enhanced Combat Systems suite. December 2004 marked the beginning of a busy upcoming year for &quot;Higgins&quot;. She became a member of the Carrier Strike Group, in the company of &quot;Nimitz&quot;, the cruiser , the destroyer , and the submarine . In the three-week Composite Unit Exercise that followed, &quot;Higgins&quot; stood out in all mission areas and, along with the other ships in the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group, was now certified &quot;surge ready&quot; to deploy.

In February 2005, the ship conducted the Congressionally-mandated inspection by the Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV). This complete material assessment of the ship was successfully completed and was highlighted by a one-day underway demonstration which showcased &quot;Higgins&quot;″ high levels of combat readiness with near-perfect grades in nearly every category. The next pre-deployment milestone consisted of &quot;Higgins&quot;″ ordnance onload at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach. Once the ship was outfitted with her deployment load of ammunition, &quot;Higgins&quot; was once again underway with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group in March for a Joint Task Force Exercise. Coincident with that two-week exercise, &quot;Higgins&quot; sent three teams to the recently instituted Non-Compliant Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure school and, as a result, became one of the first ships to deploy to the Fifth Fleet AOR with an organic non-compliant boarding capability, greatly enhancing her effectiveness in waging the Global War on Terrorism.

With only thirteen months since the previous deployment, &quot;Higgins&quot; commenced a second deployment on 6 May 2005 in company with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group. A brief stop at the North Island Naval Weapons Station provided &quot;Higgins&quot; with several new combat capabilities, particularly the new Tactical Tomahawk Cruise Missiles and the High Explosive Electronically Timed (HE-ET) and Kinetic Energy Electronically Timed (KE-ET) 5-inch projectiles. While the TACTOM missiles significantly enhance &quot;Higgins&quot;″ Strike warfare capabilities, the HE-ET and KE-ET rounds provide the ship more capable defense against an asymmetric surface threat.

In the second half of January 2006, &quot;Higgins&quot; conducted Mobility-Navigation and Seamanship (MOB-N and MOB-S) training while transiting to Puerto Vallarta for a three-day port visit. February and March saw various phases of the pre-deployment training cycle, including exercises or assessments in Anti-Terrorism and Force Protection, Engineering, Combat Systems Training Team capabilities, Supply and Medical Readiness, Damage Control, and Search and Rescue. In April 2006, &quot;Higgins&quot; offloaded ammo in Seal Beach and completed a Mobility-Engineering (MOB-E) assessment in preparation for the ensuing Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) period, which brought with it many equipment upgrades that enhanced &quot;Higgins&quot;″ warfare capabilities. In August 2006, &quot;Higgins&quot; returned to Naval Station San Diego from the shipyard and kicked off the pre-deployment &quot;workups&quot;, which included various inport scenarios involving Damage Control, Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Undersea Warfare (USW), and Strike Warfare (STW). Later in the month, &quot;Higgins&quot; returned to Seal Beach to take on weapons required for the following year&#x27;s deployment.

The ship performed logistical support for United States Coast Guard helicopters undergoing relief operations for the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

On 14 April 2018, she fired 23 Tomahawk missiles from a position in the north Persian Gulf as part of a bombing campaign in retaliation for the Syrian government&#x27;s use of chemical weapons against people in Douma. On 27 May 2018, she, alongside the guided missile cruiser patrolled the zone surrounding the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, which Vietnam has claimed as its territory, in an act to ensure freedom of navigation. Some say the patrol was in response to the deployment of H6-K bombers by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. That act was considered by the Pentagon to be an act of aggression, leading to rising tensions in the area.

On August 16, 2021, &quot;Higgins&quot; arrived in United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka as her new homeport and part of DESRON 15.

On 20 September 2022, &quot;Higgins&quot;, alongside the Canadian frigate transited the Taiwan Strait.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
The shield has background of blue with a &quot;V&quot; cutting through the center. The griffin is shown in the &quot;V&quot; wielding an axe and a trident.
The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue, white and gold respectively represent the sea, integrity and excellence. The griffin, holding an axe and a trident, denotes valor and intelligence. The axe indicates her ability and readiness for engaging land based hostilities, while the trident symbolizes her modern weapon systems, giving her air combat and undersea engagement versatility. The &quot;V&quot; of the shield represents victory and the clover leaf is for good fortune.

=== Crest ===
The crest consists of an anchor with swords crossing in the middle, both surrounded by wreaths.
The anchor is representative of the U.S. Navy. Two wreaths, one behind and one surrounding the anchor, symbolize the military and civilian honors awarded to Colonel Higgins for some unusual achievements. Crossed swords, a Naval officer&#x27;s sword and a Marine Corps Mameluke, represent the long-standing tradition of Navy and Marine Corps cooperation in times of peace and war.

=== Motto ===
The motto is written on a scroll of gold that has a blue reverse side.
The ships motto is &quot;First to Fight&quot;. The motto is a reference to the honorable feats of Colonel Higgins and is part of The &quot;Marines&quot; Hymn.

=== Seal ===
The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS HIGGINS&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 76&quot; in the base all gold.

<doc id="765397" wikidata="Q241228" url="?curid=765397" title="Agnes of Courtenay">
<text>Agnes of Courtenay ( – ) was a Frankish noblewoman who held considerable influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem during the reign of her son, King Baldwin IV. Though she was never queen, she has been described as the most powerful woman in the kingdom&#x27;s history after Queen Melisende.

Agnes was of high birth but an impoverished young widow when she married Amalric of Jerusalem. They had two children, Sibylla and Baldwin. When Amalric unexpectedly inherited the crown in 1163, the High Court of Jerusalem refused to accept Agnes as queen and insisted that Amalric repudiate her. Agnes contracted two further advantageous marriages, to powerful noblemen Hugh of Ibelin and Reginald of Sidon successively.

Agnes&#x27;s influence grew rapidly after Amalric died in 1174 and their teenage son, Baldwin IV, became king. Despite having been separated from him since his infancy, she became Baldwin&#x27;s trusted advisor. Because he suffered from leprosy, he could not marry and was growing weaker. Agnes selected government officials and influenced succession by choosing husbands for both Sibylla and Isabella, Amalric&#x27;s daughter by his second wife, Maria Comnena. She advised Baldwin to have Sibylla marry Guy of Lusignan, who thus became the king-in-waiting, and when Baldwin decided to disinherit Guy, Agnes convinced him and the nobility to crown Sibylla&#x27;s son, Baldwin V, instead. The leper king died in early 1185; she died around the same time, possibly somewhat earlier.

Count Raymond III of Tripoli and the brothers Balian (second husband of Maria Comnena) and Baldwin of Ibelin were Agnes&#x27;s chief contenders for power, and it is from sources close to them that nearly all information about Agnes is derived. She has consequently usually been criticized by historians as self-seeking, unscrupulous, and morally loose.

==Early life==

Agnes was born between 1134 and 1137. She hailed from the junior branch of the House of Courtenay. Her father, Count Joscelin II of Edessa, was the second cousin of Queen Melisende of Jerusalem, Princess Alice of Antioch, and Countess Hodierna of Tripoli, connecting her to all the Frankish Catholic rulers of the Latin East. Beatrice, her mother, held estates at Saone (in the Principality of Antioch) in dower as the widow of William of Zardana.

Agnes&#x27;s first marriage, to Reginald of Marash, ended in his death at the Battle of Inab in 1149. They had had no children. Agnes enjoyed dower rights in Marash until the town was conquered by the Muslim Turks a few months later. They captured her father the following year and kept him in prison. Her mother found herself unable to defend the remnants of the County of Edessa and sold them to the Byzantine emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, for an annual pension to be paid to herself and her children, Agnes and Joscelin III. The mother and children then retired to Saone, where Agnes stayed until 1157.

==Royal marriage==
In 1157, Agnes came to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, where she married Queen Melisende&#x27;s younger son, Count Amalric, and became countess of Jaffa and Ascalon. Though she was penniless, historian Bernard Hamilton considers Agnes to have been the most suitable bride for Amalric in the crusader states due to her high birth. Yet the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Fulcher of Angoulême, objected and Hamilton suspects that the marriage was only conducted after his death in 1157. According to William of Tyre, Fulcher was upset by the couple&#x27;s kinship, while the 13th-century &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot; states that Agnes had been betrothed to the lord of Ramla, Hugh of Ibelin, and that Amalric married her when she came to marry Hugh, irritating the patriarch. Historian Hans E. Mayer concluded that Agnes had already been married to Hugh in 1157, making her marriage to Amalric bigamous. His colleague Malcolm Barber has suggested that Amalric may have abducted Agnes. Hamilton disagrees, arguing that bigamy would have resulted in the excommunication of the couple. Agnes gave birth to a daughter, Sibylla, between 1157 and 1161. In 1161 she had a son, Baldwin.

Upon the death of his brother, King Baldwin III, on 10 February 1163, Amalric stood to succeed to the throne of Jerusalem. Yet the High Court, composed of the bishops and barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, refused to recognize him as king unless he separated from Agnes. The reason for this request, which Hamilton considers unusual, is unclear because all the primary sources, including William of Tyre, are hostile to Agnes. Reasons proposed by scholars include a tarnished reputation of Agnes and fear of the barons that Agnes would bestow royal favor on the landless exiles from Edessa if she became queen. The High Court may also have that believed Agnes, like her mother-in-law, would wield power in the government or that Amalric could make a politically and financially better match; if so, they were to be proven right on both counts.

Amalric gave in to the High Court&#x27; demand; his and Agnes&#x27;s marriage was annulled on the grounds of consanguinity. The reason was so flimsy that William of Tyre, who had been abroad at the time, had to ask Agnes&#x27;s aunt Stephanie, abbess of St Mary Major, to explain it to him. The ecclesiastical court granted Amalric&#x27;s request that their children, Sibylla and Baldwin, be legitimized, and that Agnes be absolved of any moral condemnation. Agnes was consequently never queen. She received no settlement, but did retain the prestigious title of countess, unique in the kingdom, for the rest of her life.

==Remarriages==
Immediately after the annulment of the royal marriage, Agnes married Hugh of Ibelin, to whom she may have been engaged before meeting Amalric. Hamilton concludes from Agnes&#x27;s ability to nearly instantly contract such an advantageous marriage that the High Court did not refuse to recognize her as queen due to a moral scandal. This marriage was likely arranged by Amalric, who benefited from no longer having to pay for his former wife&#x27;s upkeep.

Agnes had little contact with her children after her separation from Amalric. Her son, Baldwin, was aged two; Hamilton believes that he grew up not knowing her and that they probably only saw each other on public occasions. Amalric only remarried in 1167, taking Emperor Manuel&#x27;s grandniece Maria Komnene as his queen. The countess and the queen were on poor terms. Amalric&#x27;s only surviving child with Maria was a daughter, Isabella. This proved troubling when Baldwin, his and Agnes&#x27;s son, started showing signs of leprosy, which was then an incurable and much stigmatised illness.

Hugh died around 1169. Agnes then married her fourth and final husband, Reginald Grenier, who in 1071 succeeded his father, Gerard Grenier, as the lord of Sidon. Hamilton believes that the long-standing belief that Agnes and Reginald&#x27;s marriage was dissolved at Gerard&#x27;s request, and then presumably revalidated after Gerard&#x27;s death, stems from the misunderstanding of Gerard&#x27;s testimonial role in the dissolution of Agnes&#x27;s marriage to Amalric.

==Son&#x27;s accession==

King Amalric died after a short illness on 11 June 1174. The High Court agreed that there was no better candidate for new king than Agnes and Amalric&#x27;s son, Baldwin IV, despite suspicions of leprosy. Being a minor, Baldwin needed a regent to rule on his behalf. The custom that the mother of the minor heir should govern on his or her behalf could not be applied in Baldwin&#x27;s case: his mother, Agnes, was not the previous king&#x27;s widow, while the previous king&#x27;s widow, Queen Maria, was not the new king&#x27;s mother. The High Court&#x27;s ruling on that occasion that the right to regency belonged to the &quot;nearest relation, male or female, on the mother’s side if the claim to the throne comes through the mother, or the nearest male relation on the father’s side if the claim to the throne comes through him&quot; was entrenched into the law of the kingdom. Eventually it was Amalric&#x27;s closest male kinsman, Count Raymond III of Tripoli, who claimed the regency.

Agnes returned to the royal court when Raymond became regent. This was probably requested by her husband, Reginald of Sidon, and Baldwin and Balian of Ibelin, brothers of her previous husband, Hugh, in return for their support of Raymond&#x27;s regency. Raymond willingly shared the royal task of church patronage with Agnes: he made William of Tyre the new archbishop of Tyre in 1174, while she secured the appointment of Heraclius of Jerusalem to the archbishopric of Caesarea. Ernoul, a protegé of Amalric&#x27;s Queen Maria, accuses Agnes of love affairs with Heraclius and Aimery of Lusignan, who was also on a steady rise to the highest position in the kingdom.

==Courtenay ascendancy==
As the queen dowager, Maria, retired to her dower city of Nablus, Agnes&#x27;s arrival at the court made her the queen mother in practice even if she was just a countess in title. She had to build a bond with an adolescent son who hardly knew her and though a great mutual affection developed between them, Hamilton believes that the relationship was likely more akin to that of aunt and nephew than to that of mother and son. Hamilton surmises that the young king was glad to have her back in his life and in charge of his household. Agnes came to strongly influence her daughter, Sibylla, as well. 
In 1175, Agnes raised the funds to pay the ransom for her brother, Joscelin, who had been imprisoned by the Turks in Aleppo since 1164. Hamilton argues that Agnes could not have afforded the sum of 50,000 dinars and that it must have come from the royal treasury with the approval of the regent, Raymond. The following year, after Baldwin reached the age of majority and Raymond&#x27;s regency ended, Agnes influenced Baldwin to name Joscelin to the vacant government post of seneschal. Hamilton believes that Joscelin, as an uncle with no claim to the throne, was a prudent choice; he proved both markedly competent and wholly loyal to the king.
===Royal matchmaking===

When it became apparent that Baldwin IV was indeed affected by leprosy and therefore precluded from marrying and siring children, the question of the marriage of Agnes&#x27;s daughter, Sibylla, became central to the royal government. Sibylla&#x27;s first husband, William Longsword of Montferrat, died in 1177, leaving her with a son, Baldwin. In 1180, under unclear circumstances, Sibylla, by then the countess of Jaffa and Ascalon in her own right, married Guy of Lusignan, brother of Aimery. She was supposed to marry Duke Hugh III of Burgundy but, according to Ernoul, promised her hand to Baldwin of Ibelin on the condition that he paid his debt to the Muslim ruler of Egypt, Saladin. While Baldwin of Ibelin was in Constantinople procuring Emperor Manuel&#x27;s help in raising these funds, Ernoul elaborates, Sibylla and Agnes were convinced by Aimery that Sibylla should marry his brother Guy instead. Hamilton rejects this account as romanticized Ibelin propaganda, and argues that neither Sibylla nor Agnes would have acted so foolishly. 

William of Tyre tells about a coup attempt launched during the Holy Week in 1180 by Count Raymond III of Tripoli and Prince Bohemond III of Antioch; Hamilton concludes that they likely intended to depose Baldwin IV, install Sibylla, and have her marry a man of their own choosing (probably Baldwin of Ibelin), thereby removing the Courtenays from power. The king, acting on his mother&#x27;s advice, foiled the coup by having Sibylla marry Guy. According to historian Steven Runciman, a division occurred already at the beginning of Baldwin&#x27;s reign between, on one side, the native barons and the Hospitallers, who sought an understanding with their Muslim neighbours, and the &quot;aggressive, militantly Christian&quot; newcomers (such as the Courtenays) and Templars on the other side. Modern historians, including Bernard Hamilton and Peter Edbury, reject this traditional view. Hamilton holds that two distinct parties appeared only after Sibylla&#x27;s marriage to Guy and centred on Baldwin IV&#x27;s paternal relatives (Raymond of Tripoli, Bohemond of Antioch, and Maria Komnene and the Ibelins) and maternal relatives (Agnes and Reginald of Sidon, Sibylla and Guy, Joscelin, and Reginald of Châtillon), of whom the king supported the latter.

From 1180 to 1181, Agnes&#x27;s brother, Joscelin, was on a diplomatic mission in Constantinople, leaving King Baldwin to conduct government alone. The young monarch&#x27;s health was deteriorating, however, and during this time he particularly relied on his mother, Agnes. She accompanied him on military campaigns against Saladin and attended High Court meetings over which he presided. In October 1180, Baldwin had his younger half-sister, Isabella, daughter of Amalric by Maria Comnena, betrothed to Humphrey IV of Toron. Hamilton believes that this match too was Agnes&#x27;s idea for she was the immediate beneficiary: the marriage contracted stipulated that Humphrey should give up his patrimonial fiefs of Toron and Chastel Neuf, which Baldwin then gave to Agnes. For the first time, Agnes was a great landowner in her own right. Balian, who had married Isabella&#x27;s mother, Queen Maria, and his brother Baldwin of Ibelin were also thus prevented from using the young princess to conspire against Agnes&#x27;s children.

 
 
 
 

 
 

===Height of power===

Agnes was at the height of her power during Baldwin IV&#x27;s personal rule. Raymond and the Ibelins were in no position to challenge the countess and her party: her husband ruled Sidon; her son held the great royal cities of Jerusalem, Tyre, and Acre; her daughter and son-in-law ruled the county of Jaffa and Ascalon; her supporter Reginald of Châtillon was lord of Oultrejordain and Hebron; and she was newly landed herself. In 1182, Raymond found that her influence was such that she was able to refuse him entry into the kingdom. Agnes won another victory the same month when she persuaded her son to select Heraclius over William to become the new Latin patriarch of Jerusalem. Runciman accepts Ernoul&#x27;s account of Heraclius as a &quot;barely literate priest from the Auvergne whose good looks Agnes had found irresistible&quot;, but Hamilton argues that Heraclius was &quot;learned, energetic, and ... a resourceful diplomat&quot; and that the countess&#x27;s choice was not irresponsible.

Having become blind and crippled, Baldwin IV appointed Sibylla&#x27;s husband, Guy, to rule as regent in 1183. This was, effectively, Baldwin&#x27;s endorsement of Guy as his future successor. Agnes was not threatened because Guy owed his position to her and she held sway over Sibylla. Baldwin, however, soon became disillusioned with Guy&#x27;s character and capability and decided to depose him from the regency in late 1183 at a council convened to deal with Saladin&#x27;s siege of Kerak, where Isabella was marrying Humphrey. The council was attended by Agnes, Guy, Raymond of Tripoli, Bohemond of Antioch, Reginald of Sidon, and the Ibelin brothers.
The council presented an opportunity to the countess&#x27;s opponents for the next best candidate for regency (and thus eventual kingship) was her enemy, the count of Tripoli. Agnes offered a compromise solution which the assembled nobility accepted: the king should rule personally rather than appoint a regent (which guaranteed the prolongation of Agnes&#x27;s influence) but should also designate an heir to exclude Guy from kingship. The champions of Sibylla&#x27;s claim, Reginald of Châtillon and Joscelin, were defending Kerak; and Isabella&#x27;s claim could not be entertained as she was besieged. Raymond may have hoped to present himself as the suitable heir; if so, the countess thwarted his plan by proposing her grandson, Baldwin V, Sibylla&#x27;s son by William of Montferrat, and the boy was duly crowned. The countess was unable to prevent her son from further going after Guy nor did she intervene in the king&#x27;s attempt to separate Sibylla from Guy in early 1184.

==Death==
The last source to mention Countess Agnes as living is Ibn Jubayr. He passed by Toron in September 1184 and remarked, in the language commonly used by Muslims of the time when referring to Christians, that the area &quot;belongs to the sow known as queen who is the mother of the pig who is lord of Acre–may God destroy it&quot;.

Historian Hans Eberhard Mayer argues that Agnes died before 1 February 1185 because she took no part in the selection of regent for Baldwin V. Baldwin IV died soon after, leaving Baldwin V as the sole king and Raymond as regent once again. If she was still alive, Agnes&#x27;s influence diminished but did not end, as the boy king was under the guardianship of her brother, Joscelin. Baldwin V&#x27;s death in mid-1186 caused a succession crisis in which Agnes played no part; on 21 October, Guy, now king after all, acknowledged that Joscelin had satisfactorily executed his sister&#x27;s last will. The Kingdom of Jerusalem was conquered by Saladin following the Battle of Hattin in 1187. Sibylla and the rest of her children died in 1190, leaving Isabella I as the heir to the defeated kingdom.

==Appearance and character==
Judging by her ability to make excellent matches for herself while virtually impoverished, historian Bernard Hamilton surmises that Agnes must have been attractive. He similarly concludes that the resentment she caused among her peers points to a force of her character. In her rise from a powerless repudiated wife to the person who selected husbands for both potential heiresses and who appointed chief lay and ecclesiastical officeholders in the kingdom he sees evidence of &quot;clearly a remarkably clever woman&quot;.

The &quot;bad press&quot; she received during her lifetime has led to historians traditionally describing her as unscrupulous and opportunistic. Steven Runciman, for example, calls her &quot;vicious and greedy, insatiable for men and for money&quot; and her influence &quot;disastrous&quot;. The view that she exploited her son&#x27;s illness to fill the court with corrupt officials at the expense of capable men comes from William of Tyre, who never forgave her for her role in his defeat in the patriarchal election; he calls her a &quot;woman who was relentless in her acquisitiveness and truly hateful to God&quot;. Ernoul, whose information about Agnes is derived from her husband&#x27;s second wife, Maria, is likewise very hostile and portrays her as a woman of loose morals. Hamilton argues that Agnes&#x27;s kindness and devotion to her sick son would have earned her praise from less hostile witnesses.

Hamilton judges Agnes as a &quot;worthy daughter-in-law of Queen Melisende&quot;, if not as pious, and argues that Agnes had a more pronounced influence on the history of the Jerusalem-centred kingdom than any woman other than Melisende.

<doc id="765400" wikidata="Q382356" url="?curid=765400" title="Lineage (Buddhism)">
<text>A lineage in Buddhism is a line of transmission of the Buddhist teaching that is &quot;theoretically traced back to the Buddha himself.&quot; The acknowledgement of the transmission can be oral, or certified in documents. Several branches of Buddhism, including Chan (including Zen and Seon) and Tibetan Buddhism maintain records of their historical teachers. These records serve as a validation for the living exponents of the tradition.

The historical authenticity of various Buddhist lineages has been subject to debate. Stephen Batchelor has claimed, speaking about specifically Japanese Zen lineage, &quot;the historicity of this “lineage” simply does not withstand critical scrutiny.&quot; Erik Storlie has noted that transmission &quot;is simply false on historical grounds.&quot; Edward Conze said &quot;much of the traditions about the early history of Chan are the inventions of a later age.&quot;

==Vinaya==
In the lineage of the vinaya, the requirements for ordination as a bhikkhu (&quot;monk&quot;) or a bhikkhuni (&quot;nun&quot;) include the presence of at least five other monks, one of whom must be a fully ordained preceptor, and another an acharya (teacher). This lineage for ordaining bhikshunis became extinct in the Theravada school and in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore, when śrāmaṇerikās like Tenzin Palmo wanted full ordination, she had to travel to Hong Kong.

==Mahasiddha==
Lineages in the Mahasiddha tradition do not necessarily originate from Gautama Buddha, but are ultimately grounded, like all Buddhist lineages, in the Adi-Buddha.

==Chan and Zen lineages==
===Construction of lineages===
The idea of a patriarchal lineage in Chan Buddhism dates back to the epitaph for Fărú (法如 638–689), a disciple of the 5th patriarch, Hóngrĕn (弘忍 601–674). In the &quot;Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot; and the &quot;Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks&quot;, Daoyu and Huike are the only explicitly identified disciples of Bodhidharma. The epitaph gives a line of descent identifying Bodhidharma as the first patriarch.

In the 6th century biographies of famous monks were collected. From this genre the typical Chan-lineage was developed:
D. T. Suzuki contends that Chan&#x27;s growth in popularity during the 7th and 8th centuries attracted criticism that it had &quot;no authorized records of its direct transmission from the founder of Buddhism&quot; and that Chan historians made Bodhidharma the 28th patriarch of Buddhism in response to such attacks.

===Six patriarchs===
The earliest lineages described the lineage from Bodhidharma to Huineng. There is no generally accepted 7th Chinese Patriarch.

The principle teachers of the Chan, Zen and Seon traditions are commonly known in English translations as &quot;Patriarchs&quot;. However, the more precise terminology would be &quot;Ancestors&quot; or &quot;Founders&quot; () and &quot;Ancestral Masters&quot; or &quot;Founding Masters&quot; (), as the commonly used Chinese terms are gender neutral. Various records of different authors are known, which give a variation of transmission lines:

===Continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha===
Eventually these descriptions of the lineage evolved into a continuous lineage from Gautama Buddha to Bodhidharma. The idea of a line of descent from Gautama is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan.

According to the &quot;Song of Enlightenment&quot; (證道歌 &quot;Zhèngdào gē&quot;) by Yǒngjiā Xuánjué (665–713), one of the chief disciples of Huineng, Bodhidharma was the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha through his disciple Mahākāśyapa:
The &quot;Denkoroku&quot; gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission, and 53 overall:

===Transmission to Japan===
Twenty-four different Zen lineages are recorded to be transmitted to Japan. Only three survived until today. Sōtō was transmitted to Japan by Dōgen, who travelled to China for Chan training in the 13th century. After receiving Dharma transmission in the Caodong school, he returned to Japan and established the lineage there, where it is called the Sōtō.

The Linji school was also transmitted to Japan several times, where it is the Rinzai school.

== Pure Land Buddhism ==
Unlike the other Buddhist lineages, Pure Land Buddhism does not maintain a strict linear line of succession based on direct master-disciple relationship. Instead, various Pure Land Buddhist authors have developed lists of important Pure Land masters who have been acknowledged throughout history as having furthered the Pure Land tradition either through new insights, or by spreading of the teachings. Such teachers rarely lived at the same time as other &quot;patriarchs&quot; in the list. Nevertheless, their writings and contributions are considered to form a single continuum of Pure Land teaching and practice.

=== Chinese ===

Chinese Buddhism commonly relies on the following list of Pure Land patriarchs:
# Lúshān Huìyuǎn (334-416)
# Shàndǎo (613-681)
# Chéngyuǎn (承遠, 712-802)
# Fǎzhào (法照, dates unknown)
# Shǎokāng (少康, d. 805)
# Yǒngmíng Yánshòu (永明延壽, 904-975)
# Shěngcháng (省常, 959–1020)
# Yúnqī Zhūhóng (雲棲袾宏1535-1615)
# Ǒuyì Zhìxù (蕅益智旭1599–1655)
# Xíngcè (行策, 1628–1682)
# Shíxían (實賢, 1686–1734)
# Jìxǐng Chèwù (際醒徹悟, 1741–1810)
# Shì Yìnguāng (釋印光, c. 1861–1940)

=== Japanese ===

In Jōdo Shinshū and Jōdo Shū Buddhist traditions, &quot;Patriarch&quot; refers to seven Indian, Chinese and Japanese masters leading up to the founder of their respective schools. Both traditions agree with the list of patriarchs up to Genshin.

The Japanese patriarchal listing is as follows:
==Tibetan Buddhism==
The 14th Dalai Lama, in the foreword to &quot;Karmapa: The Sacred Prophecy&quot; states:Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha&#x27;s teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple. The master-disciple relationship is considered extremely sacred by all the major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

===Karma Kagyu===

====Possession of lineage====
Wallace renders into English a citation of Karma Chagme (, fl. 17th century) that contains an embedded quotation attributed to Nāropā (956–1041):
====Preservation of lineages====
Gyatrul (b. 1924), in a purport to Karma Chagme, conveys Dilgo Khyentse&#x27;s &#x27;samaya&#x27;, diligence and humility in receiving Vajrayana empowerment, lineal Dharma transmission and &quot;rlung&quot;, as rendered into English by Wallace (Chagmé &quot;et al.&quot;, 1998: p. 21):
===Chöd===
Chöd is an advanced spiritual practice known as &quot;Cutting Through the Ego.&quot; This practice, based on the Prajnaparamita sutra, uses specific meditations and tantric ritual.

There are several hagiographic accounts of how chöd came to Tibet. One &quot;namtar&quot; (hagiography) asserts that shortly after Kamalaśīla won his famous debate with Moheyan as to whether Tibet should adopt the &quot;sudden&quot; route to enlightenment or his own &quot;gradual&quot; route, Kamalaśīla enacted &quot;phowa&quot;, transferring his mindstream to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha named Dampa Sangye came across the vacant &quot;kuten&quot; or &quot;physical basis&quot; of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla&#x27;s body. Dampa Sangye&#x27;s mindstream in Kamalaśīla&#x27;s body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of Machig Labdrön. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own &quot;kuten&quot; and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Dampa Sangye.

<text>Vojta Beneš (11 May 1878 – 20 November 1951) was a Czech educator, political leader in Czechoslovakia and brother of Edvard Beneš.

==Life and career==
Vojta Beneš was born in Kožlany, Bohemia, then a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Beneš began his professional life as an educator at various institutions, and from 1913 to 1914 visited the United States to study its school systems. Returning to the United States with his wife, Emilie, and their children in 1915, he travelled around North America to attract support for Czechoslovak independence from Austria. For this and similar activities in the US during World War II, he became known as &quot;Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Paul Revere.&quot;

He signed Pittsburgh Agreement in 30 May 1918.

After the end of Austrian rule and the establishment of the Czechoslovak republic in 1918, Vojta Beneš was active as both an educator and public servant. He worked as a provincial school inspector, and, from 1937, as the chief inspector of the national school system. A member of the Czech Social Democratic Party, he served as a deputy in the Czechoslovak parliament from 1925 to 1935, and as senator in 1935, resigning the latter post upon his brother&#x27;s election to the presidency the following year. Beneš was also an official of the Czechoslovak legionary community and of the union of Czechoslovak teachers.

With the conclusion of the Munich Agreement in 1938 and the subsequent Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Beneš escaped to the U.S., where he began campaigning again for Czechoslovak freedom after nearly twenty-five years.

After the liberation of Czechoslovakia by Allied forces in 1945, Vojta Beneš returned to public life in his country, serving from 1946 to 1948 in the Constituent National Assembly. Following the Communist Party coup in 1948, Beneš, with the support of his daughter in Illinois, returned for the third and final time to North America with the help of the U.S. State Department. He died in South Bend, Indiana, in 1951. His remains were eventually returned to Czechoslovakia and interred in a cemetery in Prague.

==Writing==
He was the author of a number of works, including the war-time books &quot;The Mission of a Small Nation&quot; and &quot;Ten Million Prisoners&quot;, an illustrated volume of poetry for children, &quot;Naše Maminka&quot; (Our Mother), and others.

==Family==
Vojta Beneš and his wife Emilie had four children, three daughters and a son. His oldest daughter, Hana Klenková (née Benešová) was a writer and novelist in former Czechoslovakia. His son Václav was professor of political science at Indiana University and father of Eva Beneš Hanhardt, a city planner in New York City, and Nina Hajda, an author based in Manhattan, Kansas. Emilie Benes Brzezinski, a sculptor and wife of Zbigniew Brzezinski, is his grandniece; her father, Bohuš, a Czechoslovak diplomat, was the nephew of Vojta and Edvard.

<text>Arna Wendell Bontemps ( ) (October 13, 1902 – June 4, 1973) was an American poet, novelist and librarian, and a noted member of the Harlem Renaissance.

==Early life==
Bontemps was born in 1902 in Alexandria, Louisiana, into a Louisiana Creole family. His ancestors included free people of color and French colonists. His father was a contractor and sometimes would take his son to construction sites. As the boy got older, his father would take him along to speak-easies at night that featured jazz. His mother, Maria Carolina Pembroke, was a schoolteacher. The family was Catholic, and Bontemps was baptized at St. Francis Xavier Cathedral. They would later become Seventh-day Adventists.

When Bontemps was three years old, his family moved to Los Angeles, California, in the Great Migration of blacks out of the South and into cities of the North, Midwest and West. They settled in what became known as the Watts district. After attending public schools, Bontemps attended Pacific Union College in Angwin, California, where he graduated in 1923. He majored in English and minored in history, and he was also a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

==Career==
Following his graduation, Bontemps met and befriended the author Wallace Thurman, founder of &quot;Fire!!&quot; magazine, in his job at Los Angeles Post Office. Bontemps later traveled to New York City, where he settled and became part of the Harlem Renaissance.

In August 1924, at the age of 22, Bontemps published his first poem, &quot;Hope&quot; (originally called &quot;A Record of the Darker Races&quot;), in &quot;The Crisis&quot;, official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He depicted hope as an &quot;empty bark&quot; drifting meaninglessly with no purpose, referring to his confusion about his career. Bontemps, along with many other West Coast intellectuals, traveled to New York during the Harlem Renaissance.

After graduation, he moved to New York in 1924 to teach at the Harlem Academy (present-day Northeastern Academy) in New York City. While teaching, Bontemps continued to write and publish poetry. In both 1926 and 1927, he received the Alexander Pushkin Prize of &quot;&quot;, an academic journal published by the National Urban League. In 1926 he won the &quot;Crisis&quot; Poetry Prize.

In New York, Bontemps met other writers who became lifelong friends, including Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay and Jean Toomer. Hughes became a role model, collaborator, and dear friend to Bontemps.

In 1926 Bontemps married Alberta Johnson, with whom he had six children. From oldest to youngest they are: Joan, Paul, Poppy, Camille, Connie and Alex. In 1931, he left New York and his teaching position at the Harlem Academy as the Great Depression deepened. He and his family moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where he had a teaching position at Oakwood Junior College for three years.

In the early 1930s, Bontemps began to publish fiction, in addition to more poetry. He received a considerable amount of attention for his first novel, &quot;God Sends Sunday&quot; (1931). This novel explored the story of an African-American jockey named Little Augie who easily earns money and carelessly squanders it. Little Augie ends up wandering through the black sporting world when his luck as a jockey eventually runs out. Bontemps was praised for his poetic style, his re-creation of the black language, and his distinguishing characters throughout this novel. However, despite the abundant amount of praise, W. E. B. Du Bois viewed it as &quot;sordid&quot; and equated it with other &quot;decadent&quot; novels of the Harlem Renaissance. Later in his career, Bontemps collaborated with Countee Cullen to create a dramatic adaption of the novel. Together in 1946 they published this adaption as &quot;St. Louis Woman&quot;.

Bontemps also began to write several children&#x27;s books. In 1932, he collaborated with Langston Hughes and wrote &quot;Popo and Fifina&quot;. This story followed the lives of siblings Popo and Fifina, in an easy to understand introduction to Haitian life for children. Bontemps continued writing children&#x27;s novels and published &quot;You Can&#x27;t Pet a Possum&quot; (1934), which followed a story of a boy and his pet dog living in a rural part of Alabama.

During the early 1930s, African-American writers and intellectuals were discriminated against in Northern Alabama. Thirty miles from Huntsville in Decatur, the Scottsboro boys, nine African Americans, were charged with rape of two white women and being prosecuted in a case that became renowned for racial injustice. During this time, Bontemps had many friends visit and stay with him while they came to Alabama to protest this trial. The school administration was worried about his many out-of-state visitors. 

In later years, Bontemps said that the administration at Oakwood Junior College had demanded he burn many of his private books to demonstrate that he had given up radical politics. Bontemps refused to do so. He resigned from his teaching position and returned with his family to California in 1934.

In 1936 Bontemps published what is considered by some as his best work, &quot;Black Thunder&quot;. This novel explores a slave rebellion that took place in 1800 near Richmond, Virginia, led by Gabriel Prosser, an uneducated, enslaved field worker and coachman. It describes Prosser&#x27;s attempt to conduct a slave army to raid an armory in Richmond, in order to defend themselves against any assailants. A fellow slave betrayed Prosser, causing the rebellion to be shut down. Prosser was captured by whites and lynched. In Bontemps&#x27; version, whites were compelled to admit that slaves were humans who had possibilities of a promising life.

&quot;Black Thunder&quot; received many extraordinary reviews by both African-American and mainstream journals, for example, the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. Despite these rave reviews, in the midst of the Depression, Bontemps did not earn enough from sales of the novel to support his family in Chicago, where he had moved with them shortly before publishing the book. He briefly taught in Chicago at the Shiloh Academy but did not stay at the school long, leaving for a job with the Illinois Writers&#x27; Project (IWP), under the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA). 

The WPA hired writers to produce histories of states and major cities. The Illinois Project was one of the most successful state projects; it employed numerous noted writers. The project work helped them survive economically, and most also worked on their own writing. Bontemps, in addition to other work for the IWP, oversaw such young writers as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Katherine Dunham, Fenton Johnson, Frank Yerby, Richard Durham, Kitty Chapelle, and Robert Lucas, in creating the &quot;Cavalcade of the American Negro&quot; and other works. They created part of what became a massive collection of writings on the &quot;Negro in Illinois&quot;.

In 1938, following the publication of children&#x27;s book &quot;Sad-Faced Boy&quot; (1937), Bontemps was granted a Rosenwald fellowship to work on his novel, &quot;Drums at Dusk&quot; (1939). This was based on Toussaint L’Ouverture&#x27;s slave rebellion in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (which became the independent republic of Haiti). This book received wider recognition than his other novels. Some critics viewed the plot as overdramatic, while others commended its characterizations.

Bontemps struggled to make enough from his books to support his family. He was dismayed to gain little professional acknowledgement for his work despite being a prolific writer. He became discouraged as an African-American writer of this time. He started to believe that it was futile for him to attempt to address his writing to his own generation, so he chose to focus his serious writing on younger and more progressive audiences. Bontemps met Jack Conroy on the Illinois Writers’ Project, and in collaboration they wrote &quot;The Fast Sooner Hound&quot; (1942). This was a children&#x27;s story about a hound dog, Sooner, who races and outruns trains. Embarrassed about this, the roadmaster puts him against the fastest train, the Cannon Ball.

Bontemps returned to graduate school and earned a master&#x27;s degree in library science from the University of Chicago in 1943. He was appointed as head librarian at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time there, he developed important collections and archives of African-American literature and culture, namely the Langston Hughes Renaissance Collection. Bontemps was initiated as a member of the Zeta Rho chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity at Fisk in 1954. He served at Fisk until 1964 and would continue to return occasionally. Bontemps was the first black head librarian, and first black professional librarian, at Fisk.

Bontemps continued breaking barriers at Fisk up to his retirement. In 1957, Bontemps encouraged his assistant, Jessie Carney Smith, to become a librarian. After she earned her Ph.D. in library science, she returned to Fisk in 1965 to replace Bontemps as head librarian, becoming the first black woman to hold that position.

==Later years==
After retiring from Fisk University in 1966, Bontemps worked at the University of Illinois (Chicago Circle). He later moved to Yale University, where he served as curator of the James Weldon Johnson Collection.

During this time, Bontemps published numerous novels varying in genre. &quot;Slappy Hooper&quot; (1946), and &quot;Sam Patch&quot; (1951) were two children&#x27;s books that he co wrote with Jack Conroy. Individually he published &quot;Lonesome Boy&quot; (1955) and &quot;Mr. Kelso’s Lion&quot; (1970), two other children&#x27;s books. Simultaneously he was writing pieces targeted for teenagers, including biographies on George Washington Carver, Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington. His other pieces of this time were &quot;Golden Slippers&quot; (1941), &quot;Story of the Negro&quot; (1948), &quot;Chariot in the Sky&quot; (1951) and &quot;Famous Negro Athletes&quot; (1964). Critics highly praised his &quot;Story of the Negro&quot;, which received the Jane Addams Children&#x27;s Book Award and was a Newbery Honor Book.

Bontemps worked with Langston Hughes on pieces geared toward adults. They co-edited &quot;The Poetry of the Negro&quot; (1949) – described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a stimulating cross-section of the imaginative writing of the Negro&quot; that demonstrates &quot;talent to the point where one questions the necessity (other than for its social evidence) of the specialization of &#x27;Negro&#x27; in the title&quot; – and &quot;The Book of Negro Folklore&quot; (1958). Bontemps collaborated with Conroy and wrote a history of the migration of African-Americans in the United States called &quot;They Seek a City&quot; (1945). They later revised and published it as &quot;Anyplace But Here&quot; (1966). Bontemps also wrote &quot;100 Years of Negro Freedom&quot; (1961) and edited &quot;Great Slave Narratives&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Harlem Renaissance Remembered&quot; (1972). In addition he was also able to edit &quot;American Negro Poetry&quot; (1963), which was a popular anthology. He compiled his poetry in &quot;Personals&quot; (1963) and also wrote an introduction for a previous novel, &quot;Black Thunder&quot;, when it was republished in 1968.

Bontemps died aged 71 on June 4, 1973, at his home in Nashville, from a myocardial infarction (heart attack), while working on his collection of short fiction in &quot;The Old South&quot; (1973).

Through his librarianship and bibliographic work, Bontemps became a leading figure in establishing African-American literature as a legitimate object of study and preservation. His work as a poet, novelist, children&#x27;s writer, editor, librarian and historian helped shape modern African-American literature, but it also had a tremendous influence on African-American culture.

The ship was built by Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, starting on 8 May 1997. The ship was commissioned on 23 October 1999. She is named for Medal of Honor recipient Rear Admiral Richard O&#x27;Kane.

==Service history ==
USS &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot;, a Baseline 5.3 Flight II &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class guided missile destroyer, is the 27th destroyer of the class and the sixteenth built by Bath Iron Works. &quot;O’Kane&quot; is the second ship to be commissioned in her home port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was laid down on 8 May 1997 at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, launched on 28 March 1998, christened on 17 April 1998 and commissioned 23 October 1999. While transiting to Pearl Harbor on 2 October 1999, twenty one days prior to her commissioning, &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; briefly rendezvoused off the coast of Ixtapa, Mexico with the decommissioned battleship en route to Philadelphia for restoration as a museum ship.

&quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2000. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; participated in Fleet Week San Diego in October 2000. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; deployed on her maiden deployment on 1 August 2001. While on deployment &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; conducted Maritime Interdiction Operations in the Northern Persian Gulf during the opening stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; returned home to Pearl Harbor in late January 2002. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; received the Battle &quot;E&quot; award for Destroyer Squadron 31 for 2001. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; also received the Navy Unit Commendation, her first Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, her first Sea Service Ribbon, and National Defense Service Medals while on her Maiden Deployment.

Initially &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; provided escort to shipping and conducted Operation Enduring Freedom boardings of suspect terrorist vessels, then she rapidly transitioned to combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; projected combat power ashore with several salvos of Tomahawk cruise missiles and provided early warning of ballistic missile launches to command centers, Patriot missile batteries, and civil defense forces, supporting a protective umbrella for coalition ground and naval forces. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; then transitioned to providing post-hostility maritime security of Iraqi waters. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; returned home to Pearl Harbor late July 2003. &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and Global War on Terror Expeditionary Medal for her second deployment. Following post-deployment maintenance, &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; commenced the basic phase of training for her next deployment.

In February 2005, &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; deployed with USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Carrier Strike Group in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).

The ship entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in February 2015 for an overhaul at a total cost of over $56 million. It ended in February 2016, four days shy of a full year.

On 4 March 2017, &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for an Eastern Pacific Deployment to participate in Northern Edge. She made her way to Port Hueneme, San Diego, and Juneau Alaska. O&#x27;Kane returned to Pearl Harbor 15 June 2017.

On 3 November 2017, &quot;O&#x27;Kane&quot; departed Joint Base Pearl Harbor heading towards the Western Pacific.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
&quot;The shield has a background of gold and a blue wave that crosses the middle. In the center is a gold trident. Surrounding the trident is three crosses with a star at the center of each cross.&quot;The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. The trident at the center of the shield symbolizes the ship&#x27;s ability to project naval power in hostile environments. The crosses and stars is a reference to the three Navy Crosses and three Silver Stars awarded to Rear Admiral O’Kane, during his Navy career.

=== Crest ===
&quot;The crest consists of a flaming Naval sword rising from the sea, a reversed star and two dolphins that border the crest on each side.&quot;The sword is a symbol that recognizes the naval power displayed by Admiral O’Kane and his crew. The star surrounding the sword is a reference to the Medal of Honor earned by the Rear Admiral for his extraordinary actions at sea. The two dolphins are an allusion to the Rear Admiral&#x27;s time as a submariner. The red in the sword and in the border of the motto stands for O’Kane&#x27;s valor and sacrifice, during his time as a prisoner of war in two Japanese Camps during WWII.

=== Motto ===
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of blue that has a red reverse side.&quot; The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;A Tradition of Honor&quot;. The motto is a reference to both the honorable feats of Admiral O&#x27;Kane and the Medal of Honor he received.

=== Seal ===
&quot;The seal consists of the ship’s shield, crest, and motto; all of which is surrounded by a dark blue oval with a gold rope border. The ship’s name is inscribed at the top of the oval, while the ship’s hull number sits at the bottom.&quot;

From January to July 2003, &quot;Porter&quot; engaged in combat and support operations of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Joint Task Force (JTF) Cobra. &quot;Porter&quot; launched Tomahawk missiles during the Dora Farms and Shock and Awe stages of the Iraq War. &quot;Porter&quot; also worked with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) off the coast of Israel while some &quot;Porter&quot; Sailors worked with the IDF from the Nevatim base in the Negev desert of Southern Israel.

===Piracy===
On 28 October 2007, &quot;Porter&quot; attacked and sank two pirate skiffs off Somalia after receiving a distress call from the tanker which was under attack from pirates.

===2009 upgrade===
On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that &quot;Porter&quot; would be upgraded during fiscal year 2013 to RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) capability in order to function as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. In 2016 the aft CIWS mount was replaced by a SeaRAM missile system.

===Operation Nanook 2010===
In August 2010, &quot;Porter&quot; and the United States Coast Guard buoy tender participated in Operation Nanook 2010 in Baffin Bay and the Davis Straits.
This was the fourth annual Operation Nanook organized by the Canadian Government, but it was the first to host foreign vessels.

===2012 collision===
On 12 August 2012, &quot;Porter&quot; collided with , an oil tanker, near the Strait of Hormuz. The collision ripped a hole in the starboard side of the destroyer, forcing her to Jebel Ali, Dubai for repairs. No one on either ship was injured. Initially Naval Forces Central Command did not provide details about the collision, saying that it was under investigation. &quot;Porter&quot;″s captain, Commander Martin Arriola, was subsequently removed from command of the ship and replaced by Commander Dave Richardson. On 12 October 2012, &quot;Porter&quot; rejoined Carrier Strike Group 12 for its transit through the Suez Canal following temporary repairs to the ship costing $700,000. Later repairs were budgeted at a cost of nearly $50 million.

The SeaRam uses the same sensor dome as the Phalanx. This was the first time the close-range ship defense system was paired with an Aegis ship. All four ships to receive the upgrade were either Flight I or II, meaning they originally had two Phalanx CIWS systems when launched.

===Attack on Shayrat Airfield===
On 7 April 2017, a total of 59 Tomahawk missiles were fired by &quot;Porter&quot; and at military targets at Shayrat Airbase in Homs, Syria, from their positions in the eastern Mediterranean.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===
The shield has a quartered background of gold and a blue with a star in each upper quadrant. In the center of the shield is a red array enclosing a torch.

The traditional Navy colors were chosen for the shield because dark blue and gold represents the sea and excellence respectively. Red is emblematic of courage and sacrifice. The shield&#x27;s quartered division recalling previous &quot;Porter&quot;″s while underlining the US Navy&#x27;s worldwide mission and the four cardinal compass points. The stars represent each battle star earned by the fourth Porter during World War II and the Korean War. The AEGIS array is red to reflect courage and action and symbolizes her modern warfare capabilities. The Statue of Liberty torch represents the ship&#x27;s motto and signifies freedom, the principle of which our country was founded.

=== Crest ===
The crest consists of crossed swords behind an arm held trident, all surrounded by laurels.

Two Naval Officers&#x27; crossed swords honor David Porter, his son, and the ships mission to &quot;Train, Fight and Win.&quot; The laurel, arm and trident are adaptations of the US Naval Academy&#x27;s coat of arms highlighting David Porter&#x27;s tenure as the Academy Superintendent. The trident is the symbol of sea power which denotes the AEGIS vertical launch system. The three prongs of the trident represent the three wars the Porter served in; the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War.

=== Motto ===
The motto is written on a scroll of gold that has a blue reverse side.

The ships motto is &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Champion&quot;. The motto is a reference to the principles upon which the United States of America was founded and the honorable feats of Admiral Porter.

=== Seal ===
The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS PORTER&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 78&quot; in the base all gold.

He married Henrietta Fairfax Morris in March 1900. Bonsal traveled extensively. He claimed that he had visited all the countries of Europe, South America, and Asia with the exception of Persia.

==Journalist==
Bonsal was later a special correspondent of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; (1885–1907), reporting the development of military conflicts including:

* Serbo-Bulgarian War, 1885
* Macedonian uprising, 1890
* First Sino-Japanese War, 1895
* Cuban insurrection, 1897
* Spanish–American War, 1898
* Chinese relief expedition, 1900
* Samar, Batangas, Mindanao, 1901
* Venezuela, Matas rebellion, blockage, 1903

==Later life==
&quot;Unfinished Business&quot; (1944), a diary describing his experiences during the Paris Peace Treaty negotiations and all the Allied infighting and waxing lyrical about the plight of the wounded veterans and their families, won him the 1945 Pulitzer Prize for History.

&quot;No one else has presented the plight of the plain people of Europe, in relation to the strained secrecy of the Conference, and few have written of their agony as does Colonel Bonsal in terms so hardheaded and so poignant,&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported on his death.

His second son, Philip Bonsal, was a career diplomat. Another son, Dudley Bonsal, was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

&quot;The crest consists of an eagle surrounded by crossing tridents and rice stalk.&quot;Representing &quot;Oscar Austin&quot;&#x27;s modern warfare capabilities such as the AEGIS combat systems are the tridents; symbols of sea prowess. The tridents&#x27; tines denote various warfare areas: air, surface, undersea. The crossed tridents prove multiple capabilities. The surrounding rice stalks signify Vietnam, where Austin served. The eagle symbolizes freedom, the principles of which the country were founded, and the sacrifice of his own life for others&#x27; freedom.

;Motto
&quot;The motto is written on a scroll of gold with blue trim.&quot;The ship&#x27;s motto is &quot;Honor and Sacrifice&quot;. The motto is a reference to the honorable sacrifice of Private First Class Oscar P. Austin and the Medal of Honor he received.

;Seal
&quot;The coat of arms in full color as in the blazon, upon a white background enclosed within a dark blue oval border edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the inscription &quot;USS Oscar Austin&quot; at the top and &quot;DDG 79&quot; in the base all gold.&quot;

<text>Edwin Montefiore Borchard (October 17, 1884 – July 22, 1951) was an American international legal scholar, jurist, and Sterling Professor at the Yale Law School. He was a leading advocate of innocence reform and compensation for victims of wrongful conviction as well as the use of declaratory judgments. His work in international law emphasized non-intervention and neutrality.

==Education==
Borchard was born in 1884 in New York City to Michaelis Borchard, an import-export businessman, and Malwina Schachne. He attended the College of the City of New York from 1898 to 1902. He graduated with an LL.B. from New York Law School in 1905, a B.A. from Columbia University in 1908, and a PhD, from Columbia in 1913, writing a thesis entitled &quot;The Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad&quot;.

==Career==
Borchard served as the Law Librarian in the Law Library of Congress from 1911 to 1916. After a year working as an attorney for the National City Bank of New York, he accepted a position at the Yale Law School in 1917, where he was eventually appointed Sterling Professor of International Law and remained until his death. He highlighted cases of wrongly convicted people in the US and advocated for their right to compensation in &quot;Convicting the Innocent&quot;. His work led to the passage of a federal law compensating victims of wrongful conviction in federal courts. He later served as a representative of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) during the 1944 &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; Supreme Court case.

Borchard&#x27;s scholarship and public advocacy was very influential in stimulating the adoption of the declaratory judgment procedure in American courts in the 1920s and 1930s, a subject on which he also wrote a book, &quot;Declaratory Judgments.&quot;

Borchard&#x27;s other interests included music. He was first violinist in the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and president of the Orchestra Association.

== Family ==
Borchard and his wife Corinne had two daughters, Carol Borchard Sopkin (married to George Sopkin, professor of music at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and cellist of the Fine Arts Quartet) and Alice Borchard Couch).

<text>John H. Bryden (born July 15, 1943) is a Canadian politician, journalist, and historian.

==Education==
Bryden received an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in English and History from McMaster University in 1966, and a Masters of Philosophy in English from the University of Leeds in 1968.

==Early career==
From 1969 to 1989, Bryden held a number of positions as a journalist at several Canadian newspapers including the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

==Political career==
Bryden was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada during the Liberal sweep of Ontario in the 1993 election.

He was re-elected in the 1997 election for the riding of Wentworth-Burlington, and again in the 2000 election, in the riding of Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Aldershot.

He supported Deputy Prime Minister John Manley to succeed the retiring Jean Chrétien. This brought an end to his political career, as Manley was unable to make much headway against front runner Paul Martin, who not only had a large lead in polls but also controlled much of the party machinery. Bryden&#x27;s electoral district was abolished, forcing him into an uphill battle against a Martin loyalist. In February 2004, he left the Liberal Party to join the Conservative Party of Canada, citing disagreement with the actions and policies of the newly chosen Liberal leader Martin, notably criticizing Martin&#x27;s vindictiveness and blaming him for triggering the Sponsorship scandal, which proved politically disastrous for the Liberal Party. Bryden was unable to gain the Conservative nomination for his riding of Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale in the 2004 federal election, and he retired from politics.

==As a writer==
To date, his books have focused on World War II, including the area of chemical and biological warfare (&quot;Deadly Allies&quot;), signal intelligence (&quot;Best Kept Secret&quot;) and German secret intelligence (&quot;Fighting To Lose&quot;). His writing career was interrupted by his political career after his first two books. He subsequently published &quot;Fighting To Lose&quot; in 2014.

===Publications include===
*&quot;Deadly Allies: Canada&#x27;s Secret War 1937-1947&quot;, Diane Books Publishing Company, 1989. 
*&quot;Best Kept Secret: Canadian Secret Intelligence in the Second World War&quot;, Lester, 1993. 
*&quot;Fighting To Lose: How the German Secret Intelligence Service Helped the Allies Win the Second World War&quot;, Dundurn Press, 2014.

<doc id="765422" wikidata="Q2593236" url="?curid=765422" title="Persicaria odorata">
<text>Persicaria odorata, with common names Vietnamese coriander, rau răm, [[laksa]] leaf (calque from Malay &#x27;daun laksa&#x27;), Vietnamese cilantro, phak phai (from Thai: ผักแพว), praew leaf, hot mint, Cambodian mint and Vietnamese mint, is an herb whose leaves are used in Southeast Asian and Northeast Indian cooking.

But despite its other name, Vietnamese coriander is unrelated to the mints, nor is it in the mint family Lamiaceae, but its general appearance and fragrance are reminiscent of them. It is also not closely related to coriander (family Apiaceae). &quot;Persicaria&quot; is in the family Polygonaceae, collectively known as &quot;smartweeds&quot; or &quot;pinkweeds&quot;. The similarities in the tastes and smells between &quot;Persicaria&quot; and coriander and mint may be an example of convergent evolution. 

==Food uses==

The leaf is primarily associated with Vietnamese cuisine, where it is commonly eaten fresh in salads (including chicken salad) and in raw &quot;gỏi cuốn&quot;, as well as in some soups such as &quot;canh chua&quot; and &quot;bún thang&quot;, and stews, such as fish &quot;kho tộ&quot;. It is also popularly eaten with &quot;trứng vịt lộn&quot; (fertilized duck egg).

In Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia the shredded leaf is an essential ingredient of several variations of &quot;laksa&quot;, a spicy noodle soup, so much so that the leaf is commonly referred to as &quot;laksa leaf&quot; (&quot;daun laksa&quot;). The leaves are otherwise known in Malay as &quot;daun kesum&quot; and used in dishes like &quot;nasi kerabu&quot; and &quot;asam pedas&quot;.

In the Cambodian cuisine, the leaf is known as &quot;chi krasang tomhom&quot; () and is used in soups, stews and salads. It is also used in &quot;naem&quot; (ណែម), Cambodian summer rolls.

In Laos and certain parts of Thailand, the leaf is eaten with raw beef &quot;larb&quot; ().

In Burmese cuisine, the leaves are called phetphe () and used in various Burmese curries. The leaves are locally known as phak phai in neighbouring Manipur, India. The Khoibu community grind the leaves with ghost pepper and a nut locally known as &quot;bonra&quot; to make a spicy side dish.

In Australia, Persicaria odorata is being investigated as a source of essential oil (kesom oil). Research conducted in North East Victoria has shown that kesom oil has potential applications in the flavor and fragrance industry, particularly as a natural source of aliphatic aldehydes.

==Characteristics==
The Vietnamese coriander is a perennial plant that grows best in tropical and subtropical zones in warm and damp conditions. In advantageous conditions, it can grow up to 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) in height and spread up to 60 cm (24 inches). The top of its leaf is dark green, with chestnut-colored spots, while the leaf&#x27;s bottom is burgundy red. The stem is jointed at each leaf. In Vietnam, it can be cultivated or found in the wild. It can grow very well outside in summer in nontropical Europe. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil. For colder climate zones, they should be brought inside for the winter and treated as a house plant. For climate zones that have milder winters, they will survive outside, although their growth may slow down. It rarely flowers outside the tropics.

==Components==
Its oil contains aldehydes such as decanal (28%), and the alcohols dodecanol (44%) and decanol (11%). Sesquiterpenes such as α-humulene and β-caryophyllene comprise about 15% of its oil.

C-Methylated homoisoflavanones (3-(4&#x27;-methoxy-benzyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-8-methoxy-chroman-4-one, 3-(4&#x27;-methoxy-benzyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethyl-chroman-4-one, 3-(4&#x27;-hydroxy-benzyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethyl-chroman-4-one, 3-(4&#x27;-hydroxy-benzyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-8-methoxy-chroman-4-one and 3-(4&#x27;-hydroxy-benzyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-6-methyl-chroman-4-one) can be found in the rhizomes of &quot;P. odoratum&quot;.

==Traditional uses==
No scientific studies have measured &quot;P. odorata&quot;&#x27;s effects on libido. Traditionally, in Vietnam, the herb is believed to repress sexual urges. A saying in Vietnamese states, &quot;rau răm, giá sống&quot; (&quot;Vietnamese coriander, raw bean sprouts&quot;), which refers to the common belief that Vietnamese coriander reduces sexual desire, while bean sprouts have the opposite effect. Many Buddhist monks grow coriander in their private gardens and eat it frequently, believing it helps them remain celibate.

==Cultivation==
North American sources state Persicaria odorata can be grown outside in frost free parts of USDA Zones 9-11 in moderately fertile soil which is poor or well-drained but will remain moist to wet. It can tolerate full sun if there are breezes and boggy moist soil. However, part shade is desirable and it can be used as groundcover under trees.
If winter temperatures drop below overwintering indoors is possible if humidity can be maintained. Northern European sources proscribe all but summer under glass as it is hardy to H1C (minimum ) with West and South facing aspects preferable.

Persicaria odorata grows up to tall and wide in US and UK sources state are possible in 2 to 5 years.

Pests and diseases are not regarded as being problematic and it is even resistant to deer and rabbit.

==Propagation==
Propagate by seed in autumn or spring but flowering and seed harvests are rare in non-tropical climes. 
In summer, propagation via semi-ripe cuttings should be straightforward. Rooting cuttings in water is so easy that North American sources recommend against overwintering indoors where humidity cannot be maintained. Rather, source fresh bunches of rau răm in early spring cost effectively from Asian supermarkets. Remove the young leaves at the very top of the stems and any large leaves along the stems. Trim the bottom off stems to the first healthy internode and place in water until roots appear below the lowest node and then plant in soil. Expect to harvest around two months later.

<text>A transdermal patch is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose of medication through the skin and into the bloodstream. An advantage of a transdermal drug delivery route over other types of medication delivery (such as oral, topical, intravenous, or intramuscular) is that the patch provides a controlled release of the medication into the patient, usually through either a porous membrane covering a reservoir of medication or through body heat melting thin layers of medication embedded in the adhesive. The main disadvantage to transdermal delivery systems stems from the fact that the skin is a very effective barrier; as a result, only medications whose molecules are small enough to penetrate the skin can be delivered by this method. The first commercially available prescription patch was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 1979. These patches administered scopolamine for motion sickness.

In order to overcome restriction from the skin, researchers have developed microneedle transdermal patches (MNPs), which consist of an array of microneedles, which allows a more versatile range of compounds or molecules to be passed through the skin without having to micronize the medication beforehand. MNPs offer the advantage of controlled release of medication and simple application without medical professional assistance required. With advanced MNPs technology, drug delivery can be specified for local usage, for example skin whitener MNPs that are applied to the face. Many types of MNPs have been developed to penetrate tissues other than skin, such as internal tissues of the mouth and digestive tract. These promote faster and more direct delivery of the molecule to the targeted area.

==Applications==
* The highest selling transdermal patch in the United States is the nicotine patch, which releases nicotine in controlled doses to help with cessation of tobacco smoking. The first commercially available vapour patch to reduce smoking was approved in Europe in 2007.
* Two opioid medications used to provide round-the-clock relief for severe pain are often prescribed in patch form, fentanyl CII (marketed as Duragesic) and buprenorphine CIII (marketed as BuTrans).
* Hormonal patches:
** Estrogen patches are sometimes prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms (as well as post-menopausal osteoporosis) and to transgender women as a type of hormone replacement therapy.
** Contraceptive patches (marketed as Ortho Evra or Evra) and 
** Testosterone CIII patches for both men (Androderm) and women (Intrinsa).
* Nitroglycerin patches are sometimes prescribed for the treatment of angina in lieu of sublingual pills.
* Transdermal scopolamine is commonly used as a treatment for motion sickness.
* The anti-hypertensive drug clonidine is available in transdermal patch form. 
* Emsam, a transdermal form of the MAOI selegiline, became the first transdermal delivery agent for an antidepressant approved for use in the U.S. in March 2006.
* Daytrana, the first methylphenidate transdermal delivery system for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), was approved by the FDA in April 2006.
* Secuado, a transdermal form of the atypical antipsychotic asenapine, was approved by the FDA in October 2019.
* 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can also be administered through a transdermal patch, which was launched in the United Kingdom in early 2014.
* Rivastigmine, an Alzheimer&#x27;s treatment medication, was released in patch form in 2007 under the brand name Exelon.
* In December 2019, Robert S. Langer and his team developed and patented a technique whereby transdermal patches could be used to label people with invisible ink in order to store medical information subcutaneously. This was presented as a boon to &quot;developing nations&quot; where lack of infrastructure means an absence of medical records. The technology uses a &quot;quantum dot dye that is delivered along with a vaccine&quot;.
* Caffeine patches, designed to deliver caffeine to the body through the skin.

== Adverse events ==
*In 2005, the FDA announced that they were investigating reports of death and other serious adverse events related to narcotic overdose in patients using Duragesic, the fentanyl transdermal patch for pain control. The Duragesic product label was subsequently updated to add safety information in June 2005. 
*In 2007, Shire and Noven Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of the Daytrana ADHD patch, announced a voluntary recall of several lots of the patch due to problems with separating the patch from its protective release liner. Since then, no further problems with either the patch or its protective packaging have been reported.
*In 2008, two manufacturers of the fentanyl patch, ALZA Pharmaceuticals (a division of major medical manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson) and Sandoz, subsequently issued a recall of their versions of the patch due to a manufacturing defect that allowed the gel containing the medication to leak out of its pouch too quickly, which could result in overdose and death. As of March 2009, Sandoz—now manufactured by ALZA—no longer uses gel in its transdermal fentanyl patch; instead, Sandoz-branded fentanyl patches use a matrix/adhesive suspension (where the medication is blended with the adhesive instead of held in a separate pouch with a porous membrane), similar to other fentanyl patch manufacturers such as Mylan and Janssen.
*In 2009, the FDA announced a public health advisory warning of the risk of burns during MRI scans from transdermal drug patches with metallic backings. Patients should be advised to remove any medicated patch prior to an MRI scan and replace it with a new patch after the scan is complete.
*In 2009, an article in &quot;Europace&quot; journal detailed stories of skin burns that occurred with transdermal patches that contain metal (usually as a backing material) caused by shock therapy from external as well as internal cardioverter defibrillators (ICD).

== Components ==
The main components to a transdermal patch are:
*Release liner – Protects the patch during storage. The liner is removed prior to use.
*Drug – Drug solution in direct contact with release liner
*Adhesive – Serves to adhere the components of the patch together along with adhering the patch to the skin
*Membrane – Controls the release of the drug from the reservoir and multi-layer patches
*Backing – Protects the patch from the outer environment
*Penetration enhancer – These are permeation promoters for drugs, which increase delivery of drug.
*Matrix filler – Provides bulk to the matrix, and some act as matrix stiffening agents.

Other components include stabilizers (antioxidants), preservatives, etc.

== Types ==
There are five main types of transdermal patches.

=== Single-layer drug-in-adhesive ===
The adhesive layer of this system also contains the drug. In this type of patch the adhesive layer not only serves to adhere the various layers together, along with the entire system to the skin, but is also responsible for the releasing of the drug. The adhesive layer is surrounded by a temporary liner and a backing. It is characterized by the inclusion of the drug directly within the skin-contacting adhesive placed onto the epidermis.

=== Multi-layer drug-in-adhesive ===
The multi-layer drug-in-adhesive patch is similar to the single-layer system; the multi-layer system is different, however, in that it adds another layer of drug-in-adhesive, usually separated by a membrane (but not in all cases). One of the layers is for immediate release of the drug, and the other layer is for controlled release of the drug from the reservoir. This patch also has a temporary liner-layer and a permanent backing. The drug release from this depends on membrane permeability and diffusion of drug molecules.

=== Reservoir ===
Unlike the single-layer and multi-layer drug-in-adhesive systems, the reservoir transdermal system has a separate drug layer. The drug layer is a liquid compartment containing a drug solution or suspension separated by the adhesive layer. The drug reservoir is totally encapsulated in a shallow compartment molded from a drug-impermeable metallic plastic laminate, with a rate-controlling membrane made of a polymer like vinyl acetate on one surface. This patch is also backed by the backing layer. In this type of system the rate of release is zero order. Reservoir patches should not be cut (with the exception of hyoscine hyrdobromide 1.5mg patch according to the British National Formulary for Children).

=== Matrix ===
The matrix system has a drug layer of a semisolid matrix containing a drug solution or suspension. The adhesive layer in this patch surrounds the drug layer, partially overlaying it. The release rate is determined by the physical properties of the matrix. Also known as a monolithic device. Limited research indicates that it may be possible to cut some matrix patches to provide lower doses, provided the cut part not immediately used is stored at cool temperatures.

=== Vapour patch ===
In a vapour patch, the adhesive layer not only serves to adhere the various layers together but also to release vapour. Vapour patches release essential oils for up to 6 hours and are mainly used for decongestion. Other vapour patches on the market improve quality of sleep or aid in smoking cessation.

== Microneedle patch ==

The microneedle patch (MNPs) is a type of transdermal patch which retains the advantages, but reduces the disadvantages of basic transdermal patches. Embedding as many as 102-104 needles per square centimetre of patch, encapsulated or coated with intended drug, MNPs can easily pass skin tissue known as the stratum corneum which is roughly 20 μm in thickness, allowing up to the size of macromolecule to pass. MNPs were developed mainly because transdermal patch can deliver smaller size or micronized molecules such as nicotine and birth control which easily diffuse and penetrate the skin, but lack in delivering macro or large size molecules. The 100-1000 μm needles spread across the patch, making sure people will not feel any discomfort from the patch. There are two types of needles used in MNPs, the first one is non-water-soluble needles made out of metal, ceramic, or polymer, and the second one is water-soluble needles made out of saccharides or soluble polymers.

MNPs can also be engineered to deliver molecules into other tissues. Some that as of 2018 have been under development include internal surfaces such as the mouth, vagina, gastrointestinal tract, and vascular wall; and external surfaces such as the skin, eyes, fingernails, anus, and scalp.

=== MNPs drug delivery ===
As mentioned earlier, MNPs deliver more efficient delivery compared to topical or oral intake. In drug delivery study, researchers want to gain faster peak concentrations (Cmax) in MNPs compared to other methods. Study shows that MNPs reach peak concentration as fast as 20 minutes (tmax), while oral intake reaches peak concentration in one hour. Furthermore, the Cmax from MNPs is higher up to six times, compared to oral intake. Making the delivery fast and the body gets the most concentration of intended drugs. This value is only matched with direct injection, but with skin trauma and people with needle phobia, MNPs might be an alternative to reach roughly the same time and concentration.

In order to get more direct local delivery, MNPs can be used in different tissues other than the skin. In Table 1, there are at least five internal surfaces that MNPs have been studied for its delivery and four other external surfaces other than the skin.

=== Types of microneedle ===
There are many types of microneedle that are distinguished by the shape and other characteristics. The types include: Dissolvable MNPs, solid non-soluble MNPs, and hollow MNPs. Different MNPs may be chosen depending on the situation and the drug properties.

==== Soluble or dissolvable MNPs ====
One of the types of MNPs are water-soluble needles made out of soluble polymers or saccharide. However, dissolvable needles cannot efficiently deliver drugs to the dermal layer. Drug maximum concentration cannot be carried out to the skin, as the needles will dissolve beforehand. Fortunately, researchers have developed a water-insoluble backing layer, making the needle last longer in the human body environment. This design enables efficient delivery of more than 90% of the drug within 5 minutes of application of MNPs to the skin.

==== Non-soluble or undissolvable MNPs ====
Other than dissolvable MNPs, needles can also be made out of metal or ceramic that will not dissolve in the body environment. These coated drug needles can deliver consistent concentration of drugs without the needles dissolving in the body. This kind of MNPs has better performance, but compared to the soluble MNPs, metal or ceramic MNPs are the older version of MNPs. Even if the patches are small, the metal or ceramic MNPs may cause several waste issues. Recycling the metal and ceramic are very hard, as the quantity is very small to overcome the cost to recycle. That is why researchers try to develop the dissolvable MNPs with similar characteristic and performance of drug delivery in non-soluble MNPs.

==== Hollow MNPs ====
Among all of the MNPs, hollow needles allow a bigger amount of delivery up to 200μL. The mechanism mimics the operation of a hypodermic, but the fabrication is hard and complex. The hollow needles introduce a potential failure if the insertion is improper. That is why, among the others, hollow MNPs are the least popular because of the complex manufacturing and applying process.

=== Advantages ===
# The MNPs may puncture the skin surface, enabling rapid onset of drug bypassing directly into the dermal capillaries.
# Pain-free.
# Can be localized to provide direct access to the intended tissues.
# Less dependent on skilled medical workers, as MNPs can be administered safely by the patient themself.
# Some drugs have poor solubility in water, with MNPs insoluble drugs and compounds can be directly &quot;injected&quot; to the dermal layer. Further enhancing the transdermal delivery of insoluble drugs.
# Better safety compared to needle and syringe method (needlestick). Less waste, eliminate pathogen transmission, and injuries. At least 300,000 needlestick related injuries occurred in the US annually, with disposal contribute to almost half of the injuries.

=== Application ===

==== MNPs as vaccine delivery platform ====

MNPs vaccination might be an alternative from direct injection. Able to deliver bigger molecules than transdermal patch, MNPs can also deliver bioactive molecules with different physical sizes. Meaning that inactive virus or pathogen can be introduced in the body without discomfort or skin irritation from conventional injection. Possibly it can also reduce the cost of storage that usually needs to be transported in a particular temperature and condition. Stated in cdc.gov website, Mark Prausnitz, co-developer of the microneedle, says &quot;A major advantage of the microneedle patch would be the ease of delivery.&quot; The MNPs are small and thin compared to bottles of vial, making it possible to transport in massive quantities in a single trip. Medical waste such as syringes and dirty needles are also eliminated, reducing the possibility of pathogen transmission of blood-borne disease in rural areas.

In a study, measles coated MNPs might be resistant to higher temperature compared to vial transport. Higher temperature resistance is a safe bet in low income countries, where there is no such luxury for refrigeration. Furthermore, the delivery of the vaccine is controlled by the MNPs. Less requiring highly trained medical workers in developing countries to apply the vaccine. However, the study in MNPs measles vaccine is still under development, but opening possibilities in the future for other types of vaccines

==== MNPs for cosmetic and skin care ====
Skin treatment including face whitening agent and dark eye circles serum can also incorporated in MNPs. Its localized property enhance skin whitening delivery to the face area. Even a very specific spot like dark eye circles. By measuring the melanin (dark or black pigment found on the skin) index, subjects that are treated with whitening agents coated in MNPs show lower melanin index, compared to the whitening essence (topical) group. The treatment lasts for eight weeks, and the result shows MNPs might be a promising cosmetic vector because MNPs does not introduce skin irritation and can be engineered to localize or specific parts of the body.

=== Safety ===
MNPs may cause skin irritation on people with sensitive skin. Majority of studies show that MNPs do not irritate the skin.
Especially for hollow MNPs, the not so stiff needles may cause unnecessary puncture of the skin outer layer, and may cause trauma to the skin and restricting the performance and flow of the drugs to the body.

=== Future development ===
Because most of MNPs applications are still under development, it is important to note the long effect of the efficiency of the drug deliveries. Furthermore, more research is needed to get information of what molecule can be delivered using MNPs. Disposal is also an important topic, as the small plastic backing may contribute to water pollution remembering the compact size can be easily carried away by wind and water without proper disposal.

==Regulatory aspects==
A transdermal patch is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a &quot;combination product&quot;, consisting of a medical device combined with a drug or biological product that the device is designed to deliver. Prior to sale in the United States, any transdermal patch product must apply for and receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration, demonstrating safety and efficacy for its intended use.

<doc id="765427" wikidata="Q6485350" url="?curid=765427" title="Lane Bryant">
<text>Lane Bryant Inc. is an American women&#x27;s apparel and intimates specialty retailer focusing on plus-size clothing. The company began in 1904 with maternity designs created by Lena Himmelstein Bryant Malsin. Lane Bryant, Inc., is the largest plus-size retailer in the United States. As of 2022, the chain consists of 448 stores in 46 U.S. states (only Alaska, Hawaii, Montana and Wyoming do not have Lane Bryant stores). Lane Bryant, Inc. is not affiliated with Lane Bryant catalog (Brylane, Inc.), which was spun off as a separate business in 1993.

==Beginning==
Widowed at an early age, and the orphaned daughter of Lithuanian Jewish refugees, Lena Bryant supported herself and her young son as a dressmaker. Borrowing $300 from her brother-in-law, Bryant went to the bank to open an account. The bank officer misspelled her name on the application as &quot;Lane&quot; instead of &quot;Lena&quot;. In 1904, she rented a small storefront on Fifth Avenue with living quarters in the back for $12.50 a month. There she hung her garments from the gas fixtures and opened the doors.

Asked by one of her pregnant customers to design something &quot;presentable but comfortable&quot; to wear in public, Bryant created a dress with an elasticized waistband and accordion-pleated skirt. This would become the first known commercially made maternity dress. This dress was welcomed not only by middle-class women, but also by poorer pregnant women who had to work. The maternity dress soon became the best-selling garment in Bryant&#x27;s shop.

==Early company challenges==
When Bryant married Albert Malsin in 1909, he took charge of the business. He systematically began to develop and expand it. Albert instituted engineering exactness, and modern cost accounting and pricing. Sales had reached $50,000 a year by 1910 (). Albert was determined to steer the operation towards specialization. To produce in quantity and at lower cost he began to have dozens of dresses mechanically cut at once and employed high-speed sewing methods. Lane Bryant began supplying design pattern materials and financing for contractors.

Though Bryant came up with an innovative and commercially viable product, she had trouble getting the word out: Tradition dictated that topics like pregnancy were not discussed in the press. Her husband took on this challenge by convincing the &quot;New York Herald&quot; to accept advertising for their venture in 1911. When the paper did, the shop&#x27;s entire stock sold out the next day.

Bryant saw another need just before World War I. Before then, there were no mass manufacturers of clothing in larger sizes for women. After measuring 4,500 of her own customers, as well as gathering information from about 200,000 other women, it was obvious that a new challenge had to be met. Bryant determined three types of stout women and designed clothing to fit each. Plus-sized clothing quickly eclipsed the maternity line, and by 1923, company sales reached $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

==Mail order catalog==
To bypass exclusion from the newspapers, the Malsins created the first mail order catalog for maternity wear. The mail order business was developed for the women preferring privacy about their &quot;condition&quot;. By 1917, revenues from the catalog alone exceeded one million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). By 1919, their &quot;stout catalog&quot; had 52 pages and the &quot;maternity catalog&quot; had 76 pages.

==Other company innovations==
Lena Bryant was a pioneer in other ways. Her customers were important to her, and customer relations and corporate philanthropy were high on her list. At her suggestion, Lane Bryant, Inc. worked with the Red Cross to replace any Lane Bryant customer&#x27;s wardrobe destroyed in a disaster. After the 1947 Texas City Disaster in Texas City, Texas, the company outfitted 58 mail order customers whose homes were destroyed in the resulting fire.

Another concern was employee benefits. At a time when few companies offered anything more than wage, Lane Bryant offered profit sharing, pension, disability insurance, group life insurance plans, and medical benefits. By 1950, more than 3,500 employees participated in these pioneering concepts. Twenty-five percent of the stock issued when the company went public was reserved for employee subscription.

==Continued company growth==

In 1915, the first branch retail store opened in Chicago. After her death in 1951, Bryant&#x27;s sons took over the business. In 1961, Lane Bryant acquired Town &amp; Country, a Pennsylvania-based discount department store. The Town &amp; Country division was eliminated in 1977.

The Lane Bryant operations were purchased in May 1982 by The Limited founder Leslie Wexner.

==Today==
The catalog operations were licensed to Brylane (now Redcats) in 1993. The retail operations were sold to Charming Shoppes, another owner of plus-size clothing stores, in 1999 for $335 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Charming has since expanded the chain and introduced online and outlet sales. Lane Bryant&#x27;s &quot;sisters&quot; include Fashion Bug and Catherines. In order to trade on the well-known Lane Bryant brand, Charming folded all of its store sites into the Lane Bryant domain; &quot;fashionbug.com&quot; and &quot;catherines.com&quot; redirect to &quot;fashionbug.lanebryant.com&quot; and &quot;catherines.lanebryant.com&quot; respectively. Today, Lane Bryant is a large retail chain, present in many shopping centers across the United States. In 2004, Lane Bryant opened a flagship store in New York near Fifth Avenue. Charming Shoppes regained the license for the catalog operations in late October 2007. In June 2012, Ascena Retail Group, parent company of Dressbarn, purchased Charming Shoppes with a $900 million transaction through a combination of cash on hand and $325 million of borrowings from credit facilities. 
On July 23, 2020, the parent company of Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shutdowns as having “severely disrupted” its financial foundation. Stores with locations to be closed included Ann Taylor, LOFT, Lane Bryant and Lou &amp; Grey stores, including all stores across brands in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as all Catherine Stores and a “significant number” of Justice stores. In December of the same year, Ascena Retail Group sold Lane Bryant, Ann Taylor and their related brands to Premium Apparel LLC, an affiliate of Sycamore Partners, for $540 million.

==Advertising==
In 2010, Lane Bryant accused Fox and ABC of censoring their 30-second ad spot during commercial breaks for &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;American Idol&quot;. The ads featured plus-sized model Ashley Graham in their Cacique line of lingerie. Lane Bryant accused the networks of discrimination because they had no problem airing Victoria&#x27;s Secret advertisements, with similarly clad models, in the same time slots.

In March 2016, Lane Bryant accused ABC and NBC of banning a 30-second lingerie ad featuring the tagline &quot;This Body&quot;, which depicted mild nudity and breastfeeding.

==Designer collaborations==
In 2013, Lane Bryant announced its first designer collaboration with designer Isabel Toledo and artist Ruben Toledo. For Holiday 2013(December 2013), the duo produced a capsule collection with a logo tee and a tote bag featuring Ruben&#x27;s sketches. In March 2014, their first full collection for Spring 2014 was launched. On March 20, 2014, a runway presentation was held in New York City, which was simulcast live online.

In March 2014, Lane Bryant announced their second designer collaboration with Sophie Theallet. Theallet produced lingerie and sleepwear for Lane Bryant&#x27;s lingerie brand Cacique, which was released in Fall 2014 (September 2014).

<doc id="765430" wikidata="Q201712" url="?curid=765430" title="Social liberalism">
<text>Social liberalism is a political philosophy and variety of liberalism that endorses social justice, social services, a mixed economy, and the expansion of civil and political rights, as opposed to classical liberalism which favors limited government and an overall more laissez-faire style of governance. While both are committed to personal freedoms, social liberalism places greater emphasis on the role of government in addressing social inequalities and ensuring public welfare.

Economically, social liberalism is based on the social market economy and views the common good as harmonious with the individual&#x27;s freedom. Social liberals overlap with social democrats in accepting market intervention more than other liberals; its importance is considered auxiliary compared to social democrats. Ideologies that emphasize its economic policy include welfare liberalism, New Deal liberalism and New Democrats in the United States, and Keynesian liberalism. Cultural liberalism is an ideology that highlights its cultural aspects. The world has widely adopted social liberal policies.

Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centre to centre-left, although there are deviations from these positions to both the political left or right. Addressing economic and social issues, such as poverty, welfare, infrastructure, healthcare and education using government intervention, while emphasising individual rights and autonomy, are expectations under a social liberal government. In modern political discourse, social liberalism is associated with progressivism, a left-liberalism contrasted to the right-leaning neoliberalism, and combines support for a mixed economy with cultural liberalism.

&quot;Social liberalism&quot; may also refer to American progressive stances on sociocultural issues, such as reproductive rights and same-sex marriage, in contrast with American social conservatism. Cultural liberalism is often referred to as &quot;social liberalism&quot; because it expresses the social dimension of liberalism; however, it is not the same as the broader political ideology known as social liberalism. In American politics, a &quot;social liberal&quot; may hold either conservative (economic liberal) or liberal (economic progressive) views on fiscal policy.

== Origins ==
=== United Kingdom ===

By the end of the 19th century, downturns in economic growth challenged the principles of classical liberalism, a growing awareness of poverty and unemployment present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organised labour. A significant political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism came from one-nation conservatives concerned about social balance and the introduction of the famous Education Act 1870. However, socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold—became early influential critics of social injustice.

John Stuart Mill contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill developed this philosophy by liberalising the concept of consequentialism to promote a rights based system. He also developed his liberal dogma by combining the idea of using a utilitarian foundation to base upon the idea of individual rights. The new liberals tried to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. Ensuring that individuals did not physically interfere with each other or merely by impartially having formulated and applied laws could not establish an equal right to liberty. More positive and proactive measures were required to ensure that every individual would have an equal opportunity for success.

==== New Liberals ====
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a group of British thinkers known as the New Liberals made a case against &quot;laissez-faire&quot; classical liberalism. It argued in favour of state intervention in social, economic and cultural life. What they proposed is now called social liberalism. The New Liberals, including intellectuals Thomas Hill Green, Leonard Hobhouse and John A. Hobson, saw individual liberty achievable only under favourable social and economic circumstances. In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state could alleviate these conditions.

The Liberal governments of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith, mainly thanks to Chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister David Lloyd George, established the foundations of the welfare state in the United Kingdom before World War I. The comprehensive welfare state built in the United Kingdom after World War II, although primarily accomplished by the Labour Party&#x27;s Attlee ministry, was significantly designed by two Liberals, namely John Maynard Keynes (who laid the foundations in economics with the Keynesian Revolution) and William Beveridge (whose Beveridge Report was used to design the welfare system).

Historian Peter Weiler has argued: Although still partially informed by older Liberal concerns for character, self-reliance, and the capitalist market, this legislation nevertheless marked a significant shift in Liberal approaches to the state and social reform, approaches that later governments would slowly expand and that would grow into the welfare state after the Second World War. What was new in these reforms was the underlying assumption that the state could be a positive force, that the measure of individual freedom ... was not how much the state left people alone, but whether he gave them the capacity to fill themselves as individuals.

=== Germany ===
In 1860s Germany, left-liberal politicians like Max Hirsch, Franz Duncker, and Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch established trade unions—modelled on their British counterparts—to help workers improve working and economic conditions through reconciliation of interests and cooperation with their employers rather than class struggle. Schulze-Delitzsch is also the founding father of the German cooperative movement and the organiser of the world&#x27;s first credit unions. Some liberal economists, such as Lujo Brentano or Gerhart von Schulze-Gävernitz, established the (German Economic Association) in 1873 to promote social reform based on the historical school of economics and therefore rejecting classical economics, proposing a third way between Manchester Liberalism and socialist revolution in the 1871-founded German Empire.

However, the German left-liberal movement fragmented into wings and new parties over the 19th century. The main objectives of the left-liberal parties—the German Progress Party and its successors—were free speech, freedom of assembly, representative government, secret and equal but obligation-tied suffrage, and protection of private property. At the same time, they were strongly opposed to creating a welfare state, which they called state socialism. The main differences between the left-liberal parties were:

* The national ambitions.
* The different substate people&#x27;s goals.
* Free trade against &quot;Schutzzollpolitik.&quot;
* &quot;The&quot; building of the national economy.

The term &quot;social liberalism&quot; () was used first in 1891 by Austria-Hungarian economist and journalist Theodor Hertzka. Subsequently, in 1893, the historian and social reformer Ignaz Jastrow also used this term and joined the German Economic Association. He published the socialist democratic manifesto &quot;Social-liberal: Tasks for Liberalism in Prussia&quot; to create an &quot;action group&quot; for the general people&#x27;s welfare in the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which they rejected.
The National-Social Association, founded by the Protestant pastor Friedrich Naumann also maintained contacts with the left liberals. He tried to draw workers away from Marxism by proposing a mix of nationalism and Protestant-Christian-value-inflected social liberalism to overcome class antagonisms by non-revolutionary means. Naumann called this a &quot;proletarian-bourgeois integral liberalism&quot;. Although the party could not win any seats and soon dissolved, he remained influential in theoretical German left-liberalism.

In the Weimar Republic, the German Democratic Party was founded and came into an inheritance of the left-liberal past and had a leftist social wing and a rightist economic wing but heavily favoured the democratic constitution over a monarchist one. Its ideas of a socially balanced economy with solidarity, duty, and rights among all workers struggled due to the economic sanctions of the Treaty of Versailles, but it influenced local cooperative enterprises.

After 1945, the Free Democrats included most of the social liberals, including Naumann and Brentano disciple Theodor Heuss who became the first party chairman and the first Federal President of West Germany. Other social liberals joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany. Until the 1960s, post-war ordoliberalism was the model for Germany. It had a theoretical social liberal influence based on duty and rights.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the Free Democratic Party was dominated by conservative liberals, national liberals and classical liberals. However, in the 1970s, the party was briefly influenced by progressive and social liberal ideas which culminated in the 1971 Freiburg Thesis programme. Among other things, the party committed itself to &quot;self-determination&quot;, &quot;democratization of society&quot;, a &quot;reform of capitalism&quot; and a form of ecoliberalism which prioritized &quot;environmental protection over profit and personal gains&quot;. In 1977, the social liberal era came to an end with the more economically liberal Kiel Thesis programme (&quot;Kieler Thesen&quot;) effectively setting the party back on a classical liberal course.

As the Free Democrats discarded social liberal ideas in a more conservative and economically liberal approach, some members left the party and formed the social liberal Liberal Democrats in 1982. Other social liberals have found a new home in Germany&#x27;s Green party Alliance 90/The Greens.

=== France ===
In France, solidaristic thinkers, including Alfred Fouillée and Émile Durkheim, developed the social-liberal theory in the Third Republic. Sociology inspired them, and they influenced radical politicians like Léon Bourgeois. They explained that a more extensive division of labour caused more opportunity and individualism and inspired more complex interdependence. They argued that the individual had a debt to society, promoting progressive taxation to support public works and welfare schemes. However, they wanted the state to coordinate rather than manage, encouraging cooperative insurance schemes among individuals. Their main objective was to remove barriers to social mobility rather than create a welfare state.

=== United States ===

Social liberalism was a term in the United States to differentiate it from classical liberalism or &quot;laissez-faire&quot;. It dominated political and economic thought for several years until the word branched off from it around the Great Depression and the New Deal. In the 1870s and the 1880s, the American economists Richard Ely, John Bates Clark, and Henry Carter Adams—influenced both by socialism and the Evangelical Protestant movement—castigated the conditions caused by industrial factories and expressed sympathy toward labour unions. However, none developed a systematic political philosophy, and they later abandoned their flirtations with socialist thinking. In 1883, Lester Frank Ward published the two-volume &quot;Dynamic Sociology&quot;. He formalized the basic tenets of social liberalism while at the same time attacking the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies advocated by Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner. The historian Henry Steele Commager ranked Ward alongside William James, John Dewey, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and called him the father of the modern welfare state. A writer from 1884 until the 1930s, John Dewey—an educator influenced by Hobhouse, Green, and Ward—advocated socialist methods to achieve liberal goals. John Dewey&#x27;s expanding popularity as an economist also coincided with the greater Georgist movement that rose in the 1910s, pinnacling with the presidency of Woodrow Wilson. America later incorporated some social liberal ideas into the New Deal, which developed as a response to the Great Depression when Franklin D. Roosevelt came into office.

== Implementation ==

The welfare state grew gradually and unevenly from the late 19th century but fully developed following World War II, along with the mixed market economy and general welfare capitalism. Also called embedded liberalism, social liberal policies gained broad support across the political spectrum because they reduced society&#x27;s disruptive and polarizing tendencies without challenging the capitalist economic system. Businesses accepted social liberalism in the face of widespread dissatisfaction with the boom and bust cycle of the earlier financial system as it seemed to them to be a lesser evil than more left-wing modes of government. Characteristics of social liberalism were cooperation between big business, government, and labour unions. Governments could assume a vital role because the wartime economy had strengthened their power, but the extent to which this occurred varied considerably among Western democracies. Social liberalism is also a generally internationalist ideology. Social liberalism has also historically been an advocate for liberal feminism among other forms social progress.

Social liberals tend to find a compromise between the perceived extremes of unrestrained capitalism and state socialism to create an economy built on regulated capitalism. Due to a reliance on what they believe to be a too centralized government to achieve its goals, critics have called this strain of liberalism a more authoritarian ideological position compared to the original schools of liberal thought, especially in the United States, where conservatives have called presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson authoritarians.

=== United Kingdom ===

The first notable implementation of social liberal policies occurred under the Liberal Party in Britain from 1906 until 1914. These initiatives became known as the Liberal welfare reforms. The main elements included pensions for poor older adults, and health, sickness, and unemployment insurance. These changes were accompanied by progressive taxation, particularly in the People&#x27;s Budget of 1909. The old system of charity relying on the Poor Laws and supplemented by private charity, public cooperatives, and private insurance companies was in crisis, giving the state added impetus for reform. The Liberal Party caucus elected in 1906 also contained more professionals, including academics and journalists, sympathetic to social liberalism. The large business owners had mostly deserted the Liberals for the Conservatives, the latter becoming the favourite party for commercial interests. Both business interests and trade unions regularly opposed the reforms. Liberals most identified with these reforms were Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, John Maynard Keynes, David Lloyd George (especially as Chancellor of the Exchequer), and Winston Churchill (as President of the Board of Trade), in addition to the civil servant (and later Liberal MP) William Beveridge.

Most of the social democratic parties in Europe (notably the British Labour Party) have taken on strong influences of social liberal ideology. Despite Britain&#x27;s two major parties coming from the traditions of socialism and conservatism, the most substantive political and economic debates of recent times were between social liberal and classical liberal concepts.

=== Germany ===

Alexander Rüstow, a German economist, first proposed the German variant of economically social liberalism. In 1932, he dubbed this kind of social liberalism neoliberalism while speaking at the Social Policy Association. However, that term now carries a meaning different from the one proposed by Rüstow. Rüstow wanted an alternative to socialism and the classical liberal economics developed in the German Empire. In 1938, Rüstow met with various economic thinkers—including Ludwig Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Wilhelm Röpke—to determine how and what could renew liberalism. Rüstow advocated a powerful state to enforce free markets and state intervention to correct market failures. However, Mises argued that monopolies and cartels operated because of state intervention and protectionism and claimed that the only legitimate role for the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. He viewed Rüstow&#x27;s proposals as negating market freedom and saw them as similar to socialism.

Following World War II, the West German government adopted Rüstow&#x27;s neoliberalism, now usually called ordoliberalism or the social market economy, under Ludwig Erhard. He was the Minister of Economics and later became Chancellor. Erhard lifted price controls and introduced free markets. While Germany&#x27;s post-war economic recovery was due to these policies, the welfare state—which Bismarck had established—became increasingly costly.

=== Turkey ===

The Kemalist economic model was designed by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1930s, founder of the Republic of Turkey, after an unsuccessful attempt to embrace a regulated market economy from İzmir Economic Congress until the 1929 Depression. He put the principle of &quot;etatism&quot; in his Six Arrows and stated that etatism was a unique economic system for Turkey and that it was different from socialism, communism, and collectivism. Atatürk explained his economic idea as follows:

State can&#x27;t take the place of individuals, but, it must take into consideration the individuals to make them improve and develop theirselves. Etatism includes the work that individuals won&#x27;t do because they can&#x27;t make profit or the work which are necessary for national interests. Just as it is the duty of the state to protect the freedom and independence of the country and to regulate internal affairs, the state must take care of the education and health of its citizens. The state must take care of the roads, railways, telegraphs, telephones, animals of the country, all kinds of vehicles and the general wealth of the nation to protect the peace and security of the country. During the administration and protection of the country, the things we just counted are more important than cannons, rifles and all kinds of weapons. (...) Private interests are generally the opposite of the general interests. Also, private interests are based on rivalries. But, you can&#x27;t create a stable economy only with this. People who think like that are delusional and they will be a failure. (...) And, work of an individual must stay as the main basis of economic growth. Not preventing an individual&#x27;s work and not obstructing the individual&#x27;s freedom and enterprise with the state&#x27;s own activities is the main basis of the principle of democracy.

Moreover, Atatürk said this in his opening speech on 1 November 1937: &quot;Unless there is an absolute necessity, the markets can&#x27;t be intervened; also, no markets can be completely free.&quot; Also it was said by İsmet İnönü that Atatürk&#x27;s principle of etatism was Keynesian and a Turkish variant of New Deal.

=== Rest of Europe ===
The post-war governments of other countries in Western Europe also followed social liberal policies. These policies were implemented primarily by Christian democrats and social democrats as liberal parties in Europe declined in strength from their peak in the 19th century.

=== United States ===
American political discourse resisted this social turn in European liberalism. While the economic policies of the New Deal appeared Keynesian, there was no revision of liberal theory in favour of more significant state initiatives. Even though the United States lacked an effective socialist movement, New Deal policies often appeared radical and were attacked by the right. American liberalism would eventually evolve into a more anti-communist ideology as a result. American exceptionalism was likely the reason for the separate development of modern liberalism in the United States, which kept mainstream American ideology within a narrow range.

John Rawls&#x27; principal work, &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971), can be considered a flagship exposition of social liberal thinking, noted for its use of analytic philosophy and advocating the combination of individual freedom and a fairer distribution of resources. According to Rawls, every individual should be allowed to choose and pursue their conception of what is desirable. At the same time, the greater society must maintain a socially just distribution of goods. Rawls argued that differences in material wealth are tolerable if general economic growth and wealth also benefit the poorest. &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; countered utilitarian thinking in the tradition of Jeremy Bentham, instead following the Kantian concept of a social contract, picturing society as a mutual agreement between rational citizens, producing rights and duties as well as establishing and defining roles and tasks of the state. Rawls put the equal liberty principle in the first place, providing every person with equal access to the same set of fundamental liberties, followed by the fair equality of opportunity and difference, thus allowing social and economic inequalities under the precondition that privileged positions are accessible to everyone, that everyone has equal opportunities and that even the least advantaged members of society benefit from this framework. This framework repeated itself in the equation of &quot;Justice as Fairness&quot;. Rawls proposed these principles not just to adherents of liberalism but as a basis for all democratic politics, regardless of ideology. The work advanced social liberal ideas immensely within the 1970s political and philosophic academia. Rawls may therefore be a &quot;patron saint&quot; of social liberalism.

== Decline ==
Following economic problems in the 1960s and 1970s, liberal thought underwent some transformation. Keynesian financial management faced criticism for interfering with the free market. At the same time, increased welfare spending funded by higher taxes prompted fears of lower investment, lower consumer spending, and the creation of a &quot;dependency culture.&quot; Trade unions often caused high wages and industrial disruption, while total employment was considered unsustainable. Writers such as Milton Friedman and Samuel Brittan, whom Friedrich Hayek influenced, advocated a reversal of social liberalism. Their policies—often called neoliberalism—had a significant influence on Western politics, most notably on the governments of United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the United States President Ronald Reagan. They pursued policies of deregulation of the economy and reduction in spending on social services.

Part of the reason for the collapse of the social liberal coalition was a challenge in the 1960s and 1970s from financial interests that could operate independently of national governments. A related reason was the comparison of ideas such as socialized medicine, advocated by politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, facing criticisms and being dubbed as socialist by conservatives during the midst of the Red Scare, notably by the previously mentioned Reagan. Another cause was the decline of organized labour which had formed part of the coalition but was also a support for left-wing ideologies challenging the liberal consensus. Related to this were the downfall of working-class consciousness and the growth of the middle class. The push by the United States and the United Kingdom, which had been least accepting of social liberalism for trade liberalization, further eroded support.

== Contemporary revival of social liberal thought ==
From the end of the 20th century, at the same time that it was losing political influence, social liberalism experienced an intellectual revival with several substantial authors, including John Rawls (political philosophy), Amartya Sen (philosophy and economy), Ronald Dworkin (philosophy of law), Martha Nussbaum (philosophy), Bruce Ackerman (constitutional law), and others.

== Parties and organisations ==
In Europe, social liberal parties tend to be small or medium-sized centrist and centre-left parties. Examples of successful European social liberal parties participating in government coalitions at national or regional levels include the Liberal Democrats in the United Kingdom, the Democrats 66 in the Netherlands, and the Danish Social Liberal Party. In continental European politics, social liberal parties are integrated into the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, the fifth biggest group in the parliament, and includes social liberal parties, market liberal parties, and centrist parties. Other groups such as the European People&#x27;s Party, the Greens–European Free Alliance, and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats also house some political parties with social-liberal factions.

In North America, social liberalism (as Europe would refer to it) tends to be the dominant form of liberalism present, so in common parlance, &quot;liberal&quot; refers to social liberals. In Canada, social liberalism is held by the Liberal Party of Canada, while in the United States, social liberalism is a significant force within the Democratic Party.

Giving an exhaustive list of social liberal parties worldwide is difficult, mainly because political organisations are not always ideologically pure, and party ideologies often change over time. However, peers such as the Africa Liberal Network, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, the European Liberal Forum, the Liberal International, and the Liberal Network for Latin America or scholars usually accept them as parties who are following social liberalism as a core ideology.

<text>Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven (13 April 1865 – 24 August 1951) was a Cuban lawyer, educator, politician and international jurist. He promoted the existence of a common American regulation for private international law. For this reason, the sixth Pan-American Congress took place in Cuba in 1928, in the final document, the Treaty of Havana is attached in the annex of the Code of Private International Law.

He was appointed in 1908 member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of The Hague and in 1921 he was appointed judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice established by the League of Nations. He was also the first president of the National Academy of Arts and Letters of Cuba.

==Life and career==
=== Early life and education ===
Antonio Sanchez de Bustamante was born in Havana, Cuba on 13 April 1865. Bustamante married Isabel Pulido Pages, the daughter of a prominent Havana physician, in 1885. They had three sons, Gustavo and Antonio Arturo Sánchez de Bustamante Pulido, both prominent attorneys, and a third son, Dario, who died while still a law student. One of Bustamante&#x27;s grandsons, Antonio Sanchez de Bustamante Montoro, was also a lawyer and a professor of Philosophy of Law at the University of Havana. Bustamante&#x27;s law firm was located at Calle Aguacate #502 in Old Havana since 1884. For almost a century represented powerful business interests in Cuba. He completed his elementary and secondary studies in Colegio de Belén of the Society of Jesus in Havana, and in the Instituto Cardenal Cisneros in Madrid. His father, Juan Manuel Sánchez de Bustamante y García del Barrio, was a physician in Havana and professor of descriptive anatomy at the University of Havana. Bustamante started his studies of law at the Central University of Madrid while his father served as senator in the Spanish Cortes. Bustamante returned to Cuba and completed his degree of licentiate of civil and canon law at the University of Havana in 1884. A year later he completed a doctoral dissertation about the historical evolution of the Council of State at the University of Havana.

===Law professor===
Bustamante competed for and obtained the chair of Public and Private International Law of the University of Havana in 1891. He held that chair until his June 1951, confirmed by the U.S. Governor in 1899 and by the Cuban Republic after 1902.

==Politician==
He served in the Cuban Senate representing in different terms the provinces of Pinar del Río and Havana from 1902 to 1916. From that position, Bustamante chaired in several congressional periods the Senate Committee on Justice and Codes, and was a member of the Committee of Foreign Relations. He was the author of the first Cuban law regulating the procedures of constitutional judicial review passed by Congress in 1903 and in force until 1949, with amendments in 1922 and 1935. Bustamante supported progressive bills of the time like the divorce bill of 1914.

==Leader of the Havana lawyers==
From 1913 through 1923, Bustamante was the dean of the Havana Bar Association. From that position he organized the first National Legal Conference in December 1916. The conference was designed to promote the revision and update of the entire legal system, replacing the Spanish laws by modern legislation that responded to Cuban realities.

==National and international academies==
Bustamante was the first president of the National Academy of Arts and Letters established by the Cuban republic in 1910. He was also one of the founding members of the Cuban Academy of the Spanish Language. From 1942 until his death in 1951 he was the President of it. Bustamante was also the founder and president of the Cuban Association of International Law, and founder, vice-president and President of the International Academy of International and Comparative Law of The Hague.

==Constitutional Convention of 1928==
In 1928, he presided over the Constitutional Convention that amended the Constitution of 1901 and permitted President Gerardo Machado to serve a second term in office without elections. Although the political opposition to Machado and to the constitutional reform of 1928 was limited before 1930, after Machado was overthrown in August 1933, Bustamante was subject to a political trial by revolutionary tribunal organized by university students and stripped of his chair in the Havana Law School. In 1936, he was reinstated to it.

==International work==
He was the foremost Cuban authority on international law through his death. Bustamante participated as Cuban delegated in the II Peace Conference of The Hague in 1907, and a year later was appointed judge of the Arbitration Court of The Hague. In 1919, he was the Cuban diplomatic representative to the Peace Conference in Paris. In 1921, he was elected by the League of Nations as judge to the Permanent Court of International Justice, and reelected in 1930 for a second term that must have expired in 1942. Bustamante was one of the founders, vice-president, and later president of the Academy of International and Comparative Law of The Hague in 1923. He authored of the Code of Private International Law, Bustamante Code, approved by most Latin American states in the VI International Conference of Havana (1928), which he presided.

For his code, President Gerardo Machado granted him the Cross of the National Order of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, the highest decoration of the Cuban republic. Bustamante was awarded honorary doctorates in La Sorbonne, Columbia University, and the Universidad de San Marcos de Lima among others. Bustamante presided over and participated in the II and III International Congress of Comparative Law held in 1935 and 1937. He was nominated in 1949 by Nefali Ponce, the Foreign Minister of Ecuador for the Nobel Peace Prize.

<text>John Alden Carpenter (February 28, 1876 – April 26, 1951) was an American composer. Carpenter&#x27;s compositional style was considered to be mainly &quot;mildly modernistic and impressionistic&quot;; many of his works strive to encompass the spirit of America, including the patriotic &quot;The Home Road&quot; and several other jazz-inspired works. He was among the first classical composers to incorporate elements of jazz and ragtime in their pieces.

==Biography==
Carpenter was born in Park Ridge, Illinois on February 28, 1876 as a son of an American industrialist, and raised in a musical household. He was educated at Harvard University, where he studied under John Knowles Paine, and was president of the Glee Club, also writing music for the Hasty-Pudding Club. Showing great promise as a composer, he had a few lessons with Edward Elgar during a trip to Rome in 1906. later returning to the United States to study under Bernhard Ziehn in Chicago through 1912. It was there he earned a comfortable living as vice-president of the family business, a shipping supply company, from 1909 to his retirement in 1936. After his retirement, he spent much of his time composing. Carpenter served as Chairman of the Board of Children&#x27;s Home Society of Illinois and a life trustee of the Children&#x27;s Home Society of Illinois Foundation. He died in Chicago on April 26, 1951.

==Works==
Carpenter composed three ballets: &quot;Krazy Kat: A Jazz Pantomime&quot;, based on the &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; comics, was premiered at the New York Town Hall on 20 January 1922, and was the first work by a concert composer to use the word &#x27;jazz&#x27; in its title; possibly his best-known is &quot;Skyscrapers&quot; (1926), set in New York (it premiered at the Metropolitan Opera), but equally inspired by his native Chicago.

One of his most famous works was 1914&#x27;s impressionistic orchestral suite &quot;Adventures in a Perambulator&quot;. It was recorded in stereo in 1956 by Howard Hanson and the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra for Mercury Records, which initially released it on LP; Philips later reissued the recording on CD. In 1932, Carpenter completed &quot;Song of Faith&quot; for the George Washington bicentennial. His first symphony (Symphony No. 1, in C) was premiered in Norfolk Connecticut in 1917 and revised for the 50th anniversary of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, who performed it on October 24, 1940. Bruno Walter premiered his second symphony with the New York Philharmonic in 1942. He also wrote many piano pieces and songs, including the song cycle &quot;Gitanjali&quot;, with poems by Rabindranath Tagore.

His piano works include a Sonata, a Nocturne, a Polonaise, an Impromptu clearly inspired by Debussy, a Minuet and several other shorts pieces recorded in 1986 by Denver Oldham for New World Records. 

==Recordings==
Carpenter made two published commercial sound recordings. In December 1927, he joined the mezzo-soprano Mina Hager to record the voice and piano version of his set of &quot;Water-Colors&quot; (settings of four ancient Chinese poems in English translations) for a small subscription label, the Chicago Gramophone Society. In April 1932, Carpenter recorded the spoken narration in his &quot;Song of Faith&quot; with the Chicago A Cappella Choir, the Philadelphia Orchestra and conductor Noble Cain, for Victor. Carpenter made at least one private, non-commercial recording; it is possible that one or more private or off-air recordings of his performances also survive, for instance among the Mina Hager papers in Chicago.

==Honors==
Carpenter was the recipient of many honors during his lifetime:
* He was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity 
* He was made a Knight of the French Legion of Honor in 1921
* He received an honorary M.A. from Harvard in 1922
* He received an honorary Mus. Doc. from the University of Wisconsin in 1933
* He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1933.
* He was awarded the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1947

==Personal life==
In 1901, Carpenter married Rue Winterbotham, and they had one daughter, Genevieve Baldwin Carpenter, later Genevieve Carpenter Hill. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1931, he married Ellen Borden.

<text>Tillamook Head is a high promontory on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It is located in west-central Clatsop County, approximately 5 mi (8 km) southwest of Seaside. The promontory forms a steep rocky bluff on the ocean, approximately 1,200 ft (366 m) high, forested with Sitka spruce. It is located in Ecola State Park.

The promontory is named after the Tillamook, a Salishan-speaking tribe of Native Americans who inhabited the coast south of the promontory in the 19th century. In 1806, Captain William Clark and 12 members of the Corps of Discovery documented their journey south from Fort Clatsop, hiking over the promontory where they encountered a beached whale.

In 2002, the highest point on Tillamook Head was named Clark&#x27;s Mountain.

==Geology==

Tillamook Head is a tilted remnant of a flow of 15-million-year-old Columbia River basalt. The lava welled up near modern-day Idaho, and flooded down the Columbia Gorge. It spread along the Oregon Coast to Tillamook Head, cooling to a 600-foot thick basalt sill.

<text>Marguerita Maria Christians (January 19, 1892 – October 28, 1951), known as Mady Christians, was an Austrian-born German-American actress who had a successful acting career in theatre and film in the United States until she was blacklisted during the McCarthy period.

==Biography==

She was born on January 19, 1892, to 
daughter of Rudolf Christians and Bertha ( Klein) Christians. Her father was a well-known German actor. Her family moved to Berlin when she was one year old, and to New York City in 1912, where her father became the Irving Place Theatre&#x27;s general manager. Five years later she returned to Europe to study under Max Reinhardt.

She appeared in several European films before the early 1930s. In 1929, she starred in the first full sound film made in Germany &quot;It&#x27;s You I Have Loved&quot;. In 1933, she toured the United States in a play called &quot;Marching By&quot; and was offered a Broadway contract the following year that allowed her, as several other German artists, to seek refuge from the Nazi regime in the United States.

On Broadway, Christians played Queen Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and Lady Percy in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot;, staged by director Margaret Webster. Webster was part of a small but influential group of lesbian producers, directors, and actors in the theater (a group that included Eva Le Gallienne and Cheryl Crawford). Webster and Christians became close friends. According to Webster biographer Milly S. Barranger, it is likely that they also were lovers.

She also starred in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;. She originated the title role in the 1944 play &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;. Her last movie roles were in &quot;All My Sons&quot;, based on the play by Arthur Miller, and &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot;, both released in 1948. On February 13, 1949, Christians starred in &quot;Silver Cord&quot;, an episode of &quot;Ford Television Theatre&quot; on CBS. 

During World War II, Christians was involved in political work on behalf of refugees, rights for workers (especially in theater and film), and Russian War relief, political efforts that would bring her to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other anti-communist institutions and organizations.

==Blacklisting==
In addition to her political work, Christians publicly criticized the House Committee on Un-American Activities in early 1941 and likened the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee&#x27;s investigation of propaganda in US film to Nazi harassment of film and radio artists in the 1930s. 

In 1950, the FBI&#x27;s internal security division began investigating Christians, who had been identified as a &quot;concealed communist&quot; by a confidential informant. When Christians&#x27; name appeared in Red Channels, the so-called bible of the broadcast blacklist, her career was effectively over.

==Death==
On October 28, 1951, aged 59, Christians died of a cerebral hemorrhage, which some attributed to the stress of being subjected to FBI surveillance and being blacklisted.

<text>Krystal is an American regional fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Dunwoody, Georgia, with restaurants in the Southeastern United States and Puerto Rico. It is known for its small, square hamburgers, called sliders in places other than the Southeast, with steamed-in onions. Krystal moved its headquarters from Chattanooga, Tennessee, where it had been based since 1932, to the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody in early 2013.

== History ==
Founded on October 24, 1932, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, during the first years of the Great Depression, entrepreneur Rody Davenport Jr. and partner J. Glenn Sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval, &quot;People would patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean, where they could get a good meal with courteous service at the lowest possible price.&quot; The restaurant&#x27;s first customer, French Jenkins, ordered six &quot;Krystals&quot; and a cup of coffee, all for the price of 35¢ ($6.17 in today&#x27;s dollars), thus proving their theory true.

Davenport had visited Chicago&#x27;s White Castle restaurants, taking notes of successful features, before setting forth on his own venture. Davenport and Sherrill set up the first Krystal at the corner of 7th and Cherry Streets in Chattanooga. The first Krystal was a modular building constructed in Chicago and shipped to Chattanooga for final installation. The oldest Krystal still in operation is located on Cherokee Boulevard in Chattanooga&#x27;s Northshore District. Krystal is the seventh or eighth-oldest hamburger chain in the United States (the oldest being White Castle) and the oldest in the South.

Regarding the origins of the Krystal name, company legend states that Davenport and his wife were riding down a mountain road when Mrs. Mary McGee Davenport saw a lawn ornament in the shape of a crystal ball. While gazing at the lawn ornament, Mrs. Davenport commented that since Davenport and Sherrill felt cleanliness was a cornerstone of the concept, they should name the restaurant Crystal for &quot;clean as a crystal&quot;—yet with a &quot;K&quot; to add a little twist. Krystal&#x27;s restaurants through the years often sported a crystal ball on the top.

From the early 1930s through the early 1960s, the chain served much of its food not in take-out containers but on inexpensive porcelain dishes with the &quot;Krystal&quot; moniker. The waiters and waitresses wore white uniforms, and food was offered through counter service. In the 1950s, Krystal opened its first drive-through window, which most locations maintain today. A 2013 study of seven fast food franchises found that service at Krystal drive-throughs was the slowest, with an average wait time of 218 seconds. It was, however, the most accurate in terms of fulfilling orders.

In the 1950s, cake doughnuts were served as a breakfast and dessert item. From about 1970 until 1986, &quot;bone-in&quot; kettle fried chicken and related sides were offered. These items were sometimes sold from a stand-alone addition to the hamburger restaurants.

DavCo, a division of Krystal, operated Wendy&#x27;s franchises from the 1960s until 2017, when the franchises were bought back by Wendy&#x27;s and sold to NPC International. Between 1983 and 1988, DavCo also operated the Po&#x27; Folks family restaurant chain.

==Current business==
Krystal restaurants, both company-owned and franchised, operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Krystal has also operated several restaurants in Texas over the years. It is often compared to the northern restaurant chain White Castle, and other than the South Central Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee markets, the two restaurants&#x27; market areas do not generally overlap.

Krystal maintained its corporate headquarters in Chattanooga from 1932 to 2013. In the late 1990s, Krystal emerged from a bankruptcy proceeding and a sale of assets that placed majority ownership outside the heirs of the founding families. Port Royal Holdings, Inc. owned the chain from 1997 to 2012, expanding the chain to a peak of over 420 locations in 11 states in 2002, before downsizing and closing dozens of locations. It was owned by Argonne Capital Group from 2012 until 2020 when Fortress Investment Group LLC and its operating partner, Golden Child Holdings acquired Krystal. On April 28, 2023, Krystal was acquired by SPB Hospitality.
Krystal&#x27;s product line centers on a square hamburger patty slider with a steamed bun, together with diced onions, pickle, and mustard, and collectively called a &quot;Krystal&quot;. Small hot dogs called &quot;pups&quot; are also featured menu items. The chain has occasionally expanded its menu to include larger burgers, such as the &quot;Big Angus Burger&quot;, a full-size hamburger made of 100% Angus beef.

Krystal is known for a diverse breakfast menu, which includes a made-to-order country breakfast, meat and egg sandwiches, and biscuits, as well as other items. One particularly popular breakfast item is the Scrambler, which includes a layered stack of scrambled eggs, sausage, grits, and cheese served in a styrofoam cup. Other variations of the Scrambler also feature pancakes, sausage gravy, or southwestern-style spices.

In 1998, Krystal introduced the Krystal Chik, a fried chicken breast filet slider served on the signature steamed square bun. Krystal Chiks are extremely popular, along with other chicken, chili, and dessert items. Krystal continues to focus on their core menu products, but is also in the process of redesigning and upgrading their stores to appeal to a mobile and multi-tasking audience.

In the mid-2000s, Krystal tested a prototype for a new high-tech drive-in featuring individual television monitors for ordering and watching television (audio accessed via car stereo), and indoor and outdoor seating areas with multiple big-screen television monitors and free digital jukeboxes.

On January 19, 2020, Krystal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing &quot;shifting consumer tastes and preferences, growth in labor and commodity costs, increased competition, and unfavorable lease terms&quot; in the filing. Many restaurants abandoned in-room dining nearly two months later to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

On November 23, 2022, Krystal entered the Puerto Rico market.

==Competitive eating==

Krystal restaurants were the host of the Krystal Square Off, a competitive eating contest, from 2004 to 2009. The current world record is 103 Krystal burgers consumed in eight minutes by Joey Chestnut, set at the 2007 competition.

<text>Anne Revere (June 25, 1903 – December 18, 1990) was an American actress and a liberal member of the board of the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild. She was best known for her work on Broadway and her portrayals of mothers in a series of critically acclaimed films. An outspoken critic of the House Un-American Activities Committee, her name appeared in &quot;Red Channels: The Report on Communist Influence in Radio and Television&quot; in 1950 and she was subsequently blacklisted.

Revere won an Academy Award for her supporting role in the film &quot;National Velvet&quot; (1945). She was also nominated in the same category for &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943) and &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947). She won a Tony Award for her performance in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; in 1960.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, Revere was a direct descendant of American Revolution hero Paul Revere. Her father, Clinton, was a stockbroker, and she was raised on the Upper West Side and in Westfield, New Jersey, where she graduated from Westfield High School. In 1926, she graduated from Wellesley College. Despite her unsuccessful attempts to join dramatic groups in high school and (initially) in college, she eventually was successful at Wellesley and studied dramatics there. She went on to enroll at the American Laboratory School to study acting with Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslavsky.

==Career==

Revere gained early acting experience in regional and stock theater troupes. She made her Broadway debut in 1931 in &quot;The Great Barrington&quot;. Three years later, she went to Hollywood to reprise her stage role in the film adaptation of &quot;Double Door&quot;. She returned to Broadway to create the role of Martha Dobie in the original 1934 production of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, and in later years, she appeared on the New York stage in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, for which she won the 1960 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play.

Revere worked steadily as a character actress in films, appearing in nearly three dozen between 1934 and 1951. She was frequently cast in the role of a matriarch and played mother to Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Jones, Gregory Peck, John Garfield, and Montgomery Clift. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress three times and won for her performance in &quot;National Velvet&quot;. Additional screen credits included &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, and &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;.

In 1951, Revere resigned from the board of the Screen Actors Guild. At the time, she was an active member of the American Communist Party. She later pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was her last film role for two decades. She returned to the screen in &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot;.

In 1962, television director Joseph Hardy fought for Revere to appear in the popular soap opera &quot;A Time for Us&quot;. ABC finally agreed to cast Revere in the role and after that Revere appeared frequently in television soap operas like &quot;A Flame in the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;.

Revere and her husband, theatre director Samuel Rosen, moved to New York and opened an acting school, and she continued to work in summer stock and regional theater productions and on television.

== Personal life ==
Revere married Rosen on April 11, 1935, and they remained wed until his death in 1984. Revere supported Progressive Party candidate Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s campaign in 1948 and Adlai Stevenson in 1952.

==Illness and death==
Revere died of pneumonia in her home at Locust Valley, New York, on December 18, 1990, at the age of 87. She was survived by one sister. She was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

<doc id="765452" wikidata="Q529262" url="?curid=765452" title="Dave Allen (comedian)">
<text>David Tynan O&#x27;Mahony (6 July 193610 March 2005), known professionally as Dave Allen, was an Irish comedian, satirist, and actor. He was best known for his observational comedy. Allen regularly provoked indignation by highlighting political hypocrisy and showing disdain for religious authority. His technique and style have influenced young British comedians.

Initially becoming known in Australia in 1963 and 1964, Allen made regular television appearances in the United Kingdom from the late 1960s until the mid-1980s. The BBC aired his &quot;Dave Allen Show&quot; from 1971 to 1986, which was also exported to several other European countries. He had a major resurgence during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His television shows were also broadcast in the United States, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Yugoslavia, Australia, and New Zealand.

==Early life==
David Tynan O&#x27;Mahony was born in the Firhouse suburb of Dublin on 6 July 1936, the son of an Irish father and English mother. His father, Cullen &quot;Pussy&quot; O&#x27;Mahony, was the managing editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, the son of writer Nora Tynan O&#x27;Mahony, and a nephew of writer Katharine Tynan. His mother, Jean Archer, was a housewife. He, his brothers, and their mother spent around 18 months living in Keenagh, County Longford after leaving Dublin in the wake of the 1941 North Strand bombings: following this, they moved back to Dublin and lived at Cherryfield, a house between Firhouse and Templeogue Bridge. Allen was educated at Newbridge College, Terenure College, and the Catholic University School. His father died when he was 12 years old, and his mother subsequently moved the family to England when he was 14.

==Career==
Allen initially followed his father into journalism, firstly joining the &quot;Drogheda Argus&quot; as a copy boy, but at the age of 19 went to Fleet Street, London. He drifted through a series of jobs before becoming a Butlins Redcoat at Skegness in a troupe that also included British jazz trumpeter and writer John Chilton. At the end of each summer season he did stand-up at strip clubs; for the next four years, he appeared in various night clubs, theatres, and working men&#x27;s clubs. When entertainment work was slow, he worked at a toy shop in Sheffield and as a door-to-door salesman of draught excluders. He changed his stage surname to &quot;Allen&quot; at the behest of his agent, who believed that few people in the UK could pronounce &quot;O&#x27;Mahony&quot; correctly. Allen agreed to the change because he hoped that a surname beginning with &quot;A&quot; would put him at the top of agents&#x27; lists.

Allen lost the top of his left index finger above the middle knuckle after catching it in a machine cog. He enjoyed inventing stories to explain the loss, which became a minor part of his act. One version was that his brother John had surprised him by snapping his jaw shut when they were children. A further explanation he gave on his programme, &quot;Dave Allen at Large&quot;, was that he often stuck his finger in his whiskey glass and it had been eaten away by strong drink. He also said it was worn away from repeatedly brushing the dust from his suit. One of his stand-up jokes was that, as a boy, he and his friends would go to see a cowboy movie at the local cinema, then come out ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Staring down at his truncated finger, he would mutter, &quot;I had a sawn-off shotgun&quot;. On his show he told a long, elaborate ghost story, ending with &quot;something evil&quot; attacking him in a dark and haunted house. Allen grabbed and bit the attacker, the studio lights came back up, and it was his own left hand.

Allen&#x27;s first television appearance was on the BBC talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1959. He hosted pop music shows in the early 1960s, including tours by Adam Faith and Helen Shapiro and in early 1963 was the compere of a tour of Britain, headlined by Shapiro that also included The Beatles. In 1962 he toured South Africa with American vaudeville star Sophie Tucker, whom he described as &quot;one of the most charming and delightful performers with whom I have ever worked&quot;. Tucker was impressed with him and suggested he try his luck in Australia. Moving there, he worked with Digby Wolfe on Australian television, becoming Wolfe&#x27;s resident comedian.

While on tour in Australia in 1963, he accepted an offer to headline a television talk show for Channel 9, &quot;Tonight with Dave Allen&quot;, which debuted on Thursday 4 July that year and was successful. Only six months after his television début he was banned from the Australian airwaves when, during a live broadcast, he told his show&#x27;s producer—who had been pressing him to go to a commercial break—to &quot;go away and masturbate&quot;, so that he could continue an entertaining interview with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The ban was quietly dropped as Allen&#x27;s popularity continued unabated. In July 1964 it was announced that Allen would present a &#x27;series of five-minute radio shows&#x27; for Sydney station 2UW under the title &quot;This Man&#x27;s World.&quot; Allen returned to the United Kingdom in 1964 and made a number of appearances on ITV, including &quot;The Blackpool Show&quot; and &quot;Val Parnell&#x27;s Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; and on the BBC on &quot;The Val Doonican Show&quot;. In 1967, he hosted his own comedy/chat series, &quot;Tonight with Dave Allen&quot;, made by ATV, for which he received the Variety Club&#x27;s ITV Personality of the Year Award.

He signed with the BBC in 1968 and appeared on &quot;The Dave Allen Show&quot;, a variety/comedy sketch series. This was followed from 1971 to 1979 by &quot;Dave Allen at Large&quot;. The theme tune for &quot;The Dave Allen Show&quot; and &quot;Dave Allen at Large&quot;, written by Alan Hawkshaw, was titled &quot;Blarney&#x27;s Stoned&quot; (originally recorded for KPM in 1969 under the title &quot;Studio 69&quot;).

The shows introduced his solo joke-telling-while-sitting-on-a-stool-or-chair-and-drinking routine. This stand-up routine by Allen led to sketches continuing the themes touched on in the preceding monologues. Dave Allen also sought theatre roles and in 1972, he acted as a doctor in the Royal Court&#x27;s production of Edna O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s play &quot;A Pagan Place&quot;. With family friend Maggie Smith in the lead, he appeared in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in a run during 1973 and 1974. Allen played the roles of Mr Darling and Captain Hook in the production at the London Coliseum. Allen made &quot;The Dave Allen Show in Australia&quot; (1975–1977) for his old employers, Channel 9.

Allen was also a social commentator, appearing in several television documentaries for ITV, beginning with &quot;Dave Allen in the Melting Pot&quot; (1969), looking at life in New York City and dealing with issues such as racism and drugs. Later programmes included &quot;Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric&quot; (1974) and &quot;Eccentrics at Play&quot; (1974), in which he looked at colourful characters with idiosyncratic passions.

Allen&#x27;s satirising of religious ritual, especially Catholic ones, throughout each episode of &quot;Dave Allen at Large&quot; caused minor controversy, which – coupled with sometimes comparatively frank material – earned the show a risqué reputation. In 1977, the Irish state broadcaster RTÉ placed a &quot;de facto&quot; ban on Allen but he made appearances on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; being interviewed by Gay Byrne. Routines included sketches showing the pope (played by Allen) and his cardinals doing a striptease to music (&quot;The Stripper&quot;) on the steps of St Peter&#x27;s, aggressive priests beating their parishioners and each other, priests who spoke like Daleks through electronic confessionals and an extremely excitable pope who spoke in a Chico Marx style accent as he ordered Allen to &quot;getta your bum outta Roma!&quot; In 1979, he played a troubled property man suffering a mid-life crisis in Alan Bennett&#x27;s television play &quot;One Fine Day&quot;. New seasons of the comedy series, now titled &quot;Dave Allen&quot;, were broadcast from 1981 until 1990.

===Later career===
Allen&#x27;s final series for the BBC in 1990 caused controversy with this joke:

This prompted MP Robert Hayward to ask a parliamentary question about &quot;offensive language&quot; in broadcasting. In 1993, Allen returned to ITV, where he starred in the &quot;Dave Allen Show&quot;, which was his final regular television series.

By the late 1990s, Allen was living quietly in semi-retirement at his family home in Holland Park, west London. He had given up cigarettes in the 1980s, having smoked regularly during earlier television appearances. A comedy skit in 1994 talked not only about quitting smoking but hating the smell of smoke. The 1990s saw him make occasional chat show appearances and discuss his career in the six-part &quot;The Unique Dave Allen&quot; (BBC, 1998), in between clips from his past BBC series. As he grew older, Allen brought a rueful awareness of ageing to his material, with reflections on the antics of teenagers and the sagging skin and sprouting facial hair of age. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the British Comedy Awards in 1996.

==Material==
===Act===
Allen&#x27;s act was typified by a relaxed, rueful, and intimate style. He sat on a high bar stool facing his audience, smoking and occasionally sipping from a glass of what he always allowed people to assume was whiskey but in fact was merely ginger ale with ice. He was a sober-minded man, and although he sometimes appeared crotchety and irritable on stage he always gave off an air of charm and serene melancholy, both in his act and in real life. Each day he pored over newspapers, scribbling notes and ideas for his routines. Along with his seated stand-up routines, his television shows were interspersed with filmed sketch comedy.

===Religion===
Allen was a religious sceptic. He once said he was &quot;what you might call a practising atheist&quot; and often joked, &quot;I&#x27;m an atheist, thank God.&quot; His scepticism came as a result of his deeply held objections to the rigidity of his strict Catholic schooling. Consequently, religion became an important subject for his humour, especially the Catholic Church and the Church of England, generally mocking church customs and rituals rather than beliefs. In 1998, he explained:

At the end of his act, Allen always signed off with the words &quot;Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you.&quot;

==Personal life==
Allen married English actress Judith Stott in 1964. The couple had a daughter, Jane (born 1965), and a son, Edward James Tynan O&#x27;Mahony (born 1968), who later became a comedian under the name Ed Allen. Allen was also the stepfather of Stott&#x27;s son Jonathan. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983.

Allen began dating Karin Stark in 1986, and married her in 2003. The couple had a son, Cullen, who was born three weeks after Allen&#x27;s death.

Allen&#x27;s hobbies included painting, about which he became increasingly enthusiastic in his later years. His first exhibition, &quot;Private Views&quot;, was held in Edinburgh in 2001.

==Death==
On 10 March 2005, at the age of 68, Allen died peacefully in his sleep as a result of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome at his home in Kensington, London.

==Influence on others==
Highly regarded in Britain, Allen&#x27;s comic technique and style had a lasting influence on many young British comedians including Jimmy Carr. His targets were often figures of authority, his style was observational rather than gag-driven, and his language was frequently ripe; as such, he was a progenitor for the &quot;alternative&quot; comedians of the 1980s. Stewart Lee has cited Allen as an influence.

In his native Ireland, he always remained somewhat controversial. His mocking of the Catholic Church made him unpopular amongst some Irish Catholics, while his mocking of the Ulster Protestant leader Ian Paisley made him unpopular amongst many Protestants in Northern Ireland.

In a 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Adam Sandler cited Allen as one of his first comedic influences when he saw his act at the Nevele Hotel at the age of 10.

A dramatisation of Allen&#x27;s life and career, entitled &quot;Dave Allen At Peace&quot;, was shown on RTÉ One and BBC Two in 2018, with Aidan Gillen portraying Allen.

==Past methodology==
The judging/voting period was originally from 1 August of the current year to 31 July of the next year. It then underwent two changes and used to take place between September of the current year and September of the next year.

The ICC Selection Committee comprised eminent former players (one chairman, four other members) who selected the finalists for the Cricketer of the Year, Test Player of the Year, ODI Player of the Year and the Emerging Player of the Year, as well as the final ICC Test Team of the Year and ICC ODI Team of the Year.

The final selection for the awards were previously voted on by an academy of 56 (expanded from 50 in 2004–05), which included current national team captains of Test playing nations (10), members of the Elite panel of ICC umpires and referees (18), prominent former players and cricket correspondents (28). In the event of a tie in the voting, awards are shared.

<doc id="765457" wikidata="Q202218" url="?curid=765457" title="Diethyl ether">
<text>Diethyl ether, or simply ether, is an organic compound with the chemical formula , sometimes abbreviated as . It is a colourless, highly volatile, sweet-smelling (&quot;ethereal odour&quot;), extremely flammable liquid. It belongs to the ether class of organic compounds. It is a common solvent. It was formerly used as a general anesthetic.

== Production ==
Most diethyl ether is produced as a byproduct of the vapor-phase hydration of ethylene to make ethanol. This process uses solid-supported phosphoric acid catalysts and can be adjusted to make more ether if the need arises: Vapor-phase dehydration of ethanol over some alumina catalysts can give diethyl ether yields of up to 95%.

Diethyl ether can be prepared both in laboratories and on an industrial scale by the acid ether synthesis.

== Uses ==
The dominant use of diethyl ether is as a solvent. One particular application is in the production of cellulose plastics such as cellulose acetate.

===Laboratory solvent===
It is a common solvent for the Grignard reaction in addition to other reactions involving organometallic reagents. These uses exploit its basicity. Diethyl ether is a popular non-polar solvent in liquid-liquid extraction. As an extractant, it is immiscible with and less dense than water. 

Although immiscible, it has significant solubility in water (6.05 g/(100 ml) at 25 °C) and dissolves 1.5 g/(100 g) (1.0 g/(100 ml)) water at 25 °C.

=== Fuel ===
Diethyl ether has a high cetane number of 85–96 and, in combination with petroleum distillates for gasoline and diesel engines, is used as a starting fluid because of its high volatility and low flash point. Ether starting fluid is sold and used in countries with cold climates, as it can help with cold starting an engine at sub-zero temperatures. For the same reason it is also used as a component of the fuel mixture for carbureted compression ignition model engines.

==Chemical reactions==
Triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate is prepared from boron trifluoride, diethyl ether, and epichlorohydrin:
Diethyl ether is a common laboratory aprotic solvent. It is susceptible to the formation of hydroperoxides.

== Metabolism ==
A cytochrome P450 enzyme is proposed to metabolize diethyl ether.

Diethyl ether inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, and thus slows the metabolism of ethanol. It also inhibits metabolism of other drugs requiring oxidative metabolism.
For example, diazepam requires hepatic oxidization whereas its oxidized metabolite oxazepam does not.

== Safety, stability, regulations ==
Diethyl ether is extremely flammable and may form explosive vapour/air mixtures.

Since ether is heavier than air it can collect low to the ground and the vapour may travel considerable distances to ignition sources. Ether will ignite if exposed to an open flame, though due to its high flammability, an open flame is not required for ignition. Other possible ignition sources include – but are not limited to – hot plates, steam pipes, heaters, and electrical arcs created by switches or outlets. Vapour may also be ignited by the static electricity which can build up when ether is being poured from one vessel into another. The autoignition temperature of diethyl ether is . The diffusion of diethyl ether in air is (298 K, 101.325 kPa).

Ether is sensitive to light and air, tending to form explosive peroxides. Ether peroxides have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact explosives when dry. Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which reduces the formation of peroxides. Storage over sodium hydroxide precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and peroxides can be removed by either distillation from sodium and benzophenone, or by passing through a column of activated alumina.

Due to its application in the manufacturing of illicit substances, it is listed in the Table II precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances as well as substances such as acetone, toluene and sulfuric acid.

== History ==
The compound may have been synthesised by either Jābir ibn Hayyān in the 8th century or Ramon Llull in 1275. It was synthesised in 1540 by Valerius Cordus, who called it &quot;sweet oil of vitriol&quot; (&quot;oleum dulce vitrioli&quot;) – the name reflects the fact that it is obtained by distilling a mixture of ethanol and sulfuric acid (then known as oil of vitriol) – and noted some of its medicinal properties. At about the same time, Paracelsus discovered the analgesic properties of the molecule in dogs. The name &quot;ether&quot; was given to the substance in 1729 by August Sigmund Frobenius.

It was considered to be a sulfur compound until the idea was disproved in about 1800.

The synthesis of diethyl ether by a reaction between ethanol and sulfuric acid has been known since the 13th century.

=== Anesthesia ===


William T. G. Morton participated in a public demonstration of ether anesthesia on October 16, 1846, at the Ether Dome in Boston, Massachusetts. Morton had called his ether preparation, with aromatic oils to conceal its smell, &quot;Letheon&quot; after the Lethe River (Λήθη, meaning &quot;forgetfulness, oblivion&quot;). However, Crawford Williamson Long is now known to have demonstrated its use privately as a general anesthetic in surgery to officials in Georgia, as early as March 30, 1842, and Long publicly demonstrated ether&#x27;s use as a surgical anesthetic on six occasions before the Boston demonstration. British doctors were aware of the anesthetic properties of ether as early as 1840 where it was widely prescribed in conjunction with opium. Diethyl ether was preferred by some practitioners over chloroform as a general anesthetic due to ether&#x27;s more favorable therapeutic index, that is, a greater difference between an effective dose and a potentially toxic dose.

Diethyl ether does not depress the myocardium but rather it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system leading to hypertension and tachycardia. It is safely used in patients with shock as it preserves the baroreceptor reflex. Its minimal effect on myocardial depression and respiratory drive, as well as its low cost and high therapeutic index allows it to see continued use in developing countries. Diethyl ether could also be mixed with other anesthetic agents such as chloroform to make C.E. mixture, or chloroform and alcohol to make A.C.E. mixture. In the 21st century, ether is rarely used. The use of flammable ether was displaced by nonflammable fluorinated hydrocarbon anesthetics. Halothane was the first such anesthetic developed and other currently used inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, are halogenated ethers. Diethyl ether was found to have undesirable side effects, such as post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting. Modern anesthetic agents reduce these side effects.
Prior to 2005, it was on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines for use as an anesthetic.

=== Medicine ===
Ether was once used in pharmaceutical formulations. A mixture of alcohol and ether, one part of diethyl ether and three parts of ethanol, was known as &quot;Spirit of ether&quot;, Hoffman&#x27;s Anodyne or Hoffman&#x27;s Drops. In the United States this concoction was removed from the Pharmacopeia at some point prior to June 1917, as a study published by William Procter, Jr. in the &quot;American Journal of Pharmacy&quot; as early as 1852 showed that there were differences in formulation to be found between commercial manufacturers, between international pharmacopoeia, and from Hoffman&#x27;s original recipe. It is also used to treat hiccups through instillation into the nasal cavity.

=== Recreational abuse ===

The recreational use of ether also took place at organised parties in the 19th century called ether frolics, where guests were encouraged to inhale therapeutic amounts of diethyl ether or nitrous oxide, producing a state of excitation. Long, as well as fellow dentists Horace Wells, William Edward Clarke and William T. G. Morton observed that during these gatherings, people would often experience minor injuries but appear to show no reaction to the injury, nor memory that it had happened, demonstrating ether&#x27;s anaesthetic effects.

In the 19th century and early 20th century ether drinking was popular among Polish peasants. It is a traditional and still relatively popular recreational drug among Lemkos. It is usually consumed in a small quantity (&quot;&quot;, or &quot;dot&quot;) poured over milk, sugar water, or orange juice in a shot glass. As a drug, it has been known to cause psychological dependence, sometimes referred to as etheromania.

<text>Orlando Executive Airport is a public airport three miles (6 km) east of downtown Orlando, in Orange County, Florida. It is owned and operated by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) and serves general aviation.

==Overview==

Orlando Executive Airport is a general aviation and corporate aviation airport. Its proximity to the State Road 408 East-West Expressway and downtown Orlando makes it a popular airport. The airport is still the &quot;minor&quot; airport of Orlando, Florida, as Orlando International Airport is the airport for commercial airline flights, drawing more passengers every year.

The airport has been used for special air industry events and showcases including the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Convention which was held there in 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, and 2022. Orlando Executive Airport served as the receiving site for the majority of Special Olympic Athletes during the largest non-military human airlift in the US. 

The airport has also been used since the 1990s as a landing site and staging site by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) for Marine One and other supporting HMX-1 helicopter operations during Presidential visits to Orlando. All Presidential visits to the Orlando area are on Air Force One, which lands at Orlando International Airport (MCO).

==Facilities==
Executive Airport covers at an elevation of 113 feet (34 m). It has two asphalt runways: 7/25 is 6,004 by 150 feet (1,830 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 4,625 by 100 feet (1,410 x 30 m).

In the year ending December 31, 2020 the airport had 122,835 aircraft operations, an average of 337 per day: 95% general aviation, 5% air taxi and less than 1% military. In March 2022, there were 215 aircraft based at this airport: 132 single-engine, 42 multi-engine, 33 jet and 8 helicopter. The airport has two fixed-base operators (Atlantic Aviation and Sheltair Air Services), serves private and corporate aircraft and is the operating base for the Aviation Section of AdventHealth and the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

==History==
Opened in 1928 as the Orlando Municipal Airport, the airport was the first commercial airport in central Florida. The United States Postal Service started airmail service to Orlando the following year.

===Military use===

The United States Army Air Corps took control of the airport in 1940 for use as a training facility and renamed it the Orlando Army Air Base. For the next six years, the airport remained under military control. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps became the United States Army Air Forces and beginning in late 1941 through mid-1943, Orlando Army Air Base was used by I Bomber Command and later by units of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFAC) to fly antisubmarine patrols along both the east coast as well as over the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits, augmenting U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard aircraft in that capacity.

With the lessening of the U-boat threat, Orlando AAB became the home of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) and subsequently as the Army Air Forces Tactical Center (AAFTC).

In 1943 the AAFSAT began training units in night fighter operations. The 481st Night Fighter Group was established, equipped with the Douglas P-70, a variation of the A-20 Havoc attack aircraft used for training. Squadrons attached to the group in 1943 and 1944 were the 348th, 349th, 420th, 423d, 425th, 426th and 427th Night Fighter Squadrons, which, after completion of training, were sent overseas to either the Pacific or European Theaters for combat. In contrast, the Orlando Fighter Wing was stationed at the base.

In 1946 the airfield was released to the City of Orlando, while the military support facilities north and northeast of the airport remained under U.S. Army Air Forces control as a non-flying administrative and technical training installation still named Orlando Army Air Base. With the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate service in 1947, this installation was renamed Orlando Air Force Base, serving as a technical training facility for the Air Training Command, a ground-launched tactical missile training facility for the Tactical Air Command, and as a headquarters installation for the Military Air Transport Service (later Military Airlift Command) and the Air Rescue Service. In 1968, Orlando AFB was transferred to the United States Navy and renamed Naval Training Center Orlando. This installation served as the newest of one of three Navy enlisted recruit training centers (boot camps) and as home to various technical training schools, to include the Naval Nuclear Power School for officer and enlisted personnel. The 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission directed that NTC Orlando be closed no later than 1 October 1999. The base property was sold to the City of Orlando, which in turn sold it to private developers. Most of the installation was demolished and residential and commercial properties developed on the site, renamed Baldwin Park.

===Airline use===

In 1946 passenger flights on National Airlines and Eastern Air Lines began at the now civil Orlando Municipal Airport. Five years later the airport built its main terminal, a two-story structure with a built-in control tower; this terminal building stood until late 1999. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 20 weekday departures: 14 Eastern and 6 National. Eastern Air Lines had a nonstop flight to Atlanta; no other nonstops left the state. The nonstops to Washington that began in 1959 were probably the longest ORL ever had.

The August 1955 diagram shows Runway 17 along the west side of the field, Runway 18 , Runway 4 , Runway 10R (still called 10R, though 10L was closed) and Runway 13 .

By the early 1960s development around the airport had made further expansion unlikely. The airport&#x27;s 6000 foot main runway, Runway 7/25, wasn&#x27;t long enough for early jet airliners such as the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8 and Convair 880, so the city and Orange County governments lobbied the U.S. Air Force to convert McCoy Air Force Base, a Strategic Air Command B-52 base about eight miles to the south, to a civil-military airport with an airline terminal on undeveloped land on the east side of the base and military operations on the west side.

In 1961 the airport was renamed Herndon Airport after former Orlando city engineer &quot;Pat&quot; Herndon, the change being in preparation for commencing jet airline flights to the new Orlando Jetport at McCoy at McCoy AFB, known today as Orlando International Airport. In 1965 three airlines were serving Herndon Airport: Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines and National Airlines. Delta flew Douglas DC-6 and Douglas DC-7 propliners on nonstop flights to Atlanta with direct service to Chicago. Eastern and National operated Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops with National flying direct service to New York City, Boston, Washington D.C., Norfolk, Charleston, SC, Savannah, Jacksonville, FL and Miami, and Eastern operating nonstop and direct flights to Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, FL and Tallahassee. Eastern Convair 440 prop aircraft also stopped at ORL with local service being flown to several destinations in Florida. By 1966, all three airlines had switched to operating their flights from the Orlando Jetport at McCoy, no longer serving Herndon.

===Later developments===

In 1976 the City of Orlando ceded control of the airport and transferred the property, its former City of Orlando Aviation Department, and all operational responsibilities to the newly established Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA), chartered by the Florida State Legislature to operate and manage all publicly owned airports in Orange County, Florida. GOAA renamed the airport Orlando Executive Airport in 1982, and in 1998 to its present name of Executive Airport.

In 1992, in cooperation with the City of Orlando, GOAA constructed Colonel Joe Kittinger Park in the southwest corner of the airport. Named in honor of noted local aviator, Colonel Joe Kittinger Jr., USAF (Ret) by the City of Orlando, the aviation-themed park overlooks the approach end of ORL&#x27;s Runway 7. The park was temporarily closed in 2008 and partially demolished for an expansion project of the State Road 408 East-West Expressway, sacrificing part of the park&#x27;s previous facilities and acreage for a storm water retention area. The park, albeit reduced in size, reopened in March 2011. In 2014, GOAA and City of Orlando officials approved inclusion in the park of a demilitarized F-4D Phantom II jet fighter on loan from the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force (NMUSAF). This aircraft arrived at ORL from Texas on July 22, 2014 and is on pylon-mounted static display at the park. The jet received from NMUSAF, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, was actually flown by Colonel Kittinger multiple times, including while based in Thailand during the Vietnam War and after the war while based in England.

==Accidents at or near ORL==
*On October 1, 1960, an Eastern Air Lines Martin 4-0-4 on approach to ORL, when the right wing of the Martin clipped a Beechcraft Bonanza. The Martin landed safely with no injuries, but the Beech crashed and the pilot was killed.
*On November 29, 1967, a Learjet 23 operated by &quot;Jet International&quot; crashed on approach to ORL during an emergency landing, 7/10 of a mile SW of the airport because of fuel transfer problems and stalled and entered a spin on a go-around, crashing into a private home. All 3 occupants died.
*On September 1, 2022, a Diamond DA-42NG Twin Star, N43RG, was holding position short of runway 07 when a microburst occurred over the airport. The resulting strong winds flipped the aircraft, killing one individual and injuring the flight instructor.
