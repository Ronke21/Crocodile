<text>Ralph G. Neas (born May 17, 1946) is an American civil rights activist and executive. He is best known for directing a series of national campaigns to strengthen and protect civil rights laws during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. He is also known for chairing the national coalition that helped defeat the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork.

Neas served as executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; president and CEO of People For the American Way (PFAW) and the PFAW Foundation; president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care; and president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA). He served for eight years as chief legislative assistant to Republican Senators Edward Brooke of Massachusetts and David Durenberger of Minnesota. He remained a member of the Republican Party until October 1996.

==Early life and education==
Neas was born on May 17, 1946, in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1955, the Neas family moved from New England to St. Charles, Illinois. There, Neas&#x27; father, Ralph, Sr., began a career as a salesman for the American Brass Company. Neas quit public high school and attended Marmion Military Academy (Aurora, Illinois), a private Benedictine military school to set himself up for success in attending university.

Neas states that major influences before he left for college and law school were his parents, the teachings of Vatican II, his love for baseball, the civil rights movement, and the lessons he learned at Marmion.

Neas graduated from Marmion Military Academy in 1964. He earned a B.A. with honors from the University of Notre Dame in 1968, and a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1971.

==Career==
===U.S. Senate===
Neas was both active duty and reserve in the United States Army (1968–1976). In late 1971, he joined the Congressional Research Service&#x27;s American Law Division at the Library of Congress as a legislative attorney on civil rights. In January 1973, he was hired as a legislative assistant to Republican Senator Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts, eventually becoming the Senator&#x27;s chief legislative assistant. He stayed with Senator Brooke until his defeat in 1978, at which time he accepted a job as chief legislative assistant to Republican Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota.

Neas&#x27; work in the U.S. Senate spanned eight years. During that time, he focused primarily on civil rights, including the 1975 extension and expansion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the protection of Title IX, reproduction rights, and Title VI and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Neas also worked on the Watergate scandal, health care, and ethics reform. While working for Senator Durenberger in 1979–1980, he conceived and drafted the &quot;Women&#x27;s Economic Equity Act,&quot; parts of which were enacted during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

===Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR)===
From 1981 through 1995, Neas served as Executive Director of the nonpartisan Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the legislative arm of the civil rights movement. Neas coordinated successful national campaigns that led to the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Civil Rights Restoration Act; the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988; the Japanese American Civil Liberties Act; the preservation of the Executive Order on Affirmative Action (1985–1986 and 1995–1996); and the 1982 Voting Right Act Extension. Final passage on all these laws averaged 85% in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; in addition, another 15 Leadership Conference on Civil Rights legislative priorities were enacted into law in the 1981–1995 period.

Neas pointed out during July 11, 1996, testimony before the House Democratic Caucus, Committee on Organization Study and Review regarding Bipartisan Cooperation in Congress, &quot;the average final passage vote on these laws was 85%&quot; in both the House and Senate.

William T. Taylor, former General Counsel and Staff Director of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and then an LCCR executive committee member wrote that Neas &quot;seemed an unlikely choice [because] he was a white male Catholic Republican who had gone to Notre Dame, where he devoted himself to becoming an officer in the ROTC.&quot;

He was chair of the Block Bork Coalition in 1987. 

===Political career===

In 1998, Neas ran against incumbent Republican Representative Connie Morella in Maryland&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, composed primarily of the suburban areas just northwest of Washington, DC. Morella defeated Neas 60% to 40%.

===People For the American Way===
In late 1999, Neas was named the President and CEO of People For the American Way and People For the American Way Foundation. For eight years, Neas helped lead national efforts to preserve an independent and fair judiciary; to protect civil rights and civil liberties; and to defend and reform public schools in the United States.

In addition, Neas helped put together civic engagement partnerships to recruit and manage 25,000 volunteers in 2004 for the non-partisan and nationally recognized Election Protection program (to help ensure every vote counts), to direct non-partisan programs that registered 525,000 African and Latino voters in three years, and to establish youth leadership development programs across the country (Young People For and Young Elected Officials).

===National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC)===
In late 2007, Neas became active in the health care reform movement, becoming senior advisor to the president of the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), a non-partisan coalition of more than 80 national organizations (representing consumer groups, medical societies, civil rights groups, small and large businesses, civil right groups, pension funds, disability senior citizens unions and senior citizen and good government organizations). In February 2009, Neas became the CEO of NCHC to help lead the final push for the Affordable Care Act, focusing on system-wide reform, quality health care, cost containment, and the need for bipartisanship. Neas also worked closely with the generic pharmaceutical industry to convey the importance of promoting generics as a critical cost saving and pro-consumer strategy to ensure a sustainable health care system.

===Generic Pharmaceutical Association===
On September 12, 2011, Neas became President and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), which represents the manufacturers and distributors of finished generic pharmaceuticals.

Neas and GPhA played a leadership role in protecting the Hatch-Waxman Act; enacting the Generic Drug User Fees Act; promoting and defending biosimilars at the national and state levels; and making sure that international trade agreements did not favor manufacturers of brand medicines and biologics.

During Neas&#x27; tenure, GPhA also launched the Biosimilars Council.

Between 1979 and 2016, both the New York Times and the Washington Post cited Neas several hundred times. The Wall Street editorial pages have discussed Neas in more than 45 editorials and op-eds.

Neas has made more than 50 appearances on C-SPAN. In 2009, along with Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Ver) and Arlen Specter (R and then D-Pa), and conservative activist Manny Miranda Neas was the subject of a film documentary entitled &quot;Advise and Dissent&quot;; In 2014-2016, Neas was featured in a play by Anthony Giardina, &quot;City of Conversation&quot;, at the Lincoln Center in New York, the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C, and in theaters in other parts of the United States.

On October 9, 1987, Neas was named ABC World News&#x27; &quot;Person of the Week&quot; for his leadership role opposing the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination

==Personal life==
Neas is a baseball fan. As a child, his goal was to play third base for the Boston Red Sox.

In early 1979, Neas received last rites from a Roman Catholic priest after the onset of near-total paralysis which was caused by Guillain–Barré syndrome (also known as &quot;French Polio.&quot;) After nearly five months in the hospital, much of it on a respirator in the intensive care unit, he recovered, and co-founded the Guillain Barre Syndrome Foundation, whose primary focus is on families affected by the disease.

Neas married Katherine Beh in 1988, and their daughter Maria was born in 1999.

<doc id="758521" wikidata="Q1934586" url="?curid=758521" title="Mile High Stadium">
<text>Mile High Stadium (originally Bears Stadium until 1968) was an outdoor multi-purpose stadium located in Denver, Colorado, from 1948 to 2002.

The stadium was built in 1948 to accommodate the Denver Bears baseball team, which was a member of the Western League during its construction. Originally designed as a baseball venue, the stadium was expanded in later years to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city, the Denver Broncos, as well as to improve Denver&#x27;s hopes of landing a Major League Baseball team. Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific venue, it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting both sports for a majority of its life.

The Broncos called Mile High Stadium home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000. The Bears, who changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1984, continued to play in the stadium until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans. The move was precipitated by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver, and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High. The team played the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver.

In addition to the Broncos, Bears/Zephyrs, and Rockies, Mile High Stadium was home to several other professional teams during the course of its history. The Denver Gold of the United States Football League called Mile High home from 1983 to 1985, and the stadium played host to the inaugural USFL championship game on July 17, 1983. Three professional soccer teams also played at Mile High. The first was the Denver Dynamos of the North American Soccer League, who were founded in 1974 and played their first two seasons in Denver before moving to Bloomington, Minnesota, and becoming the Minnesota Kicks. The second was the Colorado Caribous of the North American Soccer League playing just the 1978 season before moving to Atlanta and becoming the Atlanta Chiefs. Denver was home to one of Major League Soccer&#x27;s 10 charter franchises as the Colorado Rapids were formed and played in Mile High from 1996 until 2001, making them the last franchise to play in Mile High Stadium prior to its closure.

After the Rapids&#x27; 2001 season, Mile High Stadium was closed and in 2002 the stadium was demolished.

==History==

===Early years as Bears Stadium (1948–1959)===

Mile High Stadium was originally built as Bears Stadium for minor league baseball by Bob Howsam in 1948 at the site of a former landfill. The stadium initially consisted of a single 18,000-seat grandstand stretching along the north side from the left field foul pole to the right field foul pole on the west side. Luther &quot;Bud&quot; Phillips hit the first official home run out of Bears Stadium. In its first full season in 1949, the Bears averaged over 6,600 per game to lead the minor leagues in attendance.

In the late 1950s, there was an attempt to form a third major league, the Continental League, helmed by former Dodger general manager Branch Rickey. Howsam, who had worked with Rickey years before with the St. Louis Cardinals, joined ranks with Rickey, pleading for a major league team in Denver. Advised that to get a major league franchise Denver would need a much larger ballpark, Bears Stadium would begin the first of its many expansions. Over 8,000 seats were added to the south stands, bringing stadium capacity to 23,100.

Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) answer to the Continental League was to expand its two Leagues, which would eventually lead to the folding of the Continental League. Although Denver was not awarded a franchise, MLB promised teams in the future for Denver and other cities. Howsam was now trapped with a massive debt load and a stadium far too big for a minor-league team. Frantically searching for a solution, he concluded the only way out was to extend the stadium&#x27;s season with football.

===The Broncos as the primary tenant (1960–1992)===

A large bleacher section was added along the south side and temporary east stands were built in 1960, raising the capacity to 34,657; baseball capacity was 26,500 

Howsam&#x27;s ownership in the AFL was short-lived, as overwhelming debt forced Howsam to sell all his sports interests in 1961. His dream of major league baseball in Denver would be placed on hold for another 30 years.

One condition of including Denver in the AFL–NFL merger announced in 1966 was expanding Bears Stadium to at least 50,000 seats. This required adding second and third decks along the west sideline (first base line). This expansion was completed in 1968, when the stadium was sold to the city of Denver, which renamed it Mile High Stadium and built the upper deck along the west side, thus raising capacity to 50,657.

====1970s====

Early &#x27;70s expansion

The Broncos sold out every game in their inaugural NFL season. Every Broncos game—preseason, regular season (not including games with replacement players) and playoffs—has been sold out since, a streak that continued after the Broncos left Mile High. As ticket sales increased, the stadium expanded to 51,706 seats. With a $25 million bond issue in 1974 another stadium renovation added more seats. By 1976, seating was up to 63,532 as the upper decks construction was completed along the north end zone (third base line).

The east stands

An ingenious expansion that took place from 1975 to 1977 raised the capacity to 75,103 by extending the upper deck that was along the north side and building movable, triple-decked stands along the east side. When fully retracted toward the field, the stands would form a horseshoe for football, appropriate considering the team was the Denver Broncos. Yet when fully extended by 145 feet (44 m), the stadium could still fit a normal-sized baseball field with outfield distances of down the left-field line, to left-center and 423 to center field.

The movable structure was 450 feet (137 m) long, 200 feet (61 m) wide, and weighed nearly 9 million pounds (4,500 short tons, 4,000 metric tons). When a game or event required moving the stands the in or out, engineers pumped water into 163 water bearings spaced out beneath the stands, lifting the structure off its foundation. A sheet of water ⅓-inch thick formed under the structure. Hydraulic rams then pushed the stands forward at the rate of two feet per minute, taking stadium engineers about six hours from start to finish to move the stands.

The south stands

The south stands of Mile High Stadium had, for many years, a reputation for having the most vociferous fans. While not matching other cities&#x27; stadiums for rowdiness or bad behavior, the south stands ticketholders nevertheless represented some of the Broncos&#x27; most ardent fans who were able to generate an outsized impact on the noise level of the stadium despite the open gaps between the south stands and the east and west stands.

Bucky Bronco

In 1975, Denver approached actor Roy Rogers to commission a statue of his horse, Trigger, for display at the stadium. A , fiberglass replica of the horse had previously been produced for the Roy Rogers Museum in Victorville, California. Rogers agreed, with the stipulation that the new statue not be named &quot;Trigger&quot;. Denver fans were polled by &quot;The Denver Post&quot; to decide on a different name, and &quot;Bucky&quot; was chosen. Painted white to match the Broncos logo, the statue was mounted atop the scoreboard at Mile High, where it remained for 25 years before being relocated to the new stadium. Mounted, the statue measures and .

====1980s====
Mile High Stadium, in the 1970s and 1980s, was the only professional-caliber baseball facility to have an all grass infield, with sliding pits around bases. This unique feature was similar to several newer Major League Baseball stadiums that also used sliding pits, except those other stadiums all had artificial turf infields. In 1986, 77 luxury suites were added atop the west stands, increasing the official seating capacity to 76,123.

==== 1990s ====
==== The Colorado Rockies arrive ====
The stadium&#x27;s large capacity combined with enthusiasm for the new team and the lowest MLB ticket prices allowed the expansion Rockies to set Major League Baseball attendance records before moving to Coors Field for the 1995 season. The stadium was known for its loudness with the sound of fans stomping in the bleachers echoing within the horseshoe. The large center and right fields, foul territory areas (although left field was shorter than average), and center field&#x27;s 30-foot (10 m) high fence, was not as problematic for pitchers as Coors Field would be. The club&#x27;s 1993 season attendance was 4,483,350 in 79 home dates (81 games – 2 doubleheaders), an average of 56,751 per home date. The Rockies were on pace to exceed the record during the strike-shortened 1994 season. They had drawn 3,281,511 in 57 home dates (also 57 games), an average of 57,570 per home date. (Season attendance figures from &quot;The Sporting News Baseball Record Book&quot;, 2007, p. 234; Game counts are from game logs on Retrosheet.)

===Final years (2000–2001)===
The final football game at Mile High Stadium was December 23, 2000, in which the Broncos routed the 49ers, 38–9. The Broncos had defeated every visiting franchise from the stadium&#x27;s opening to close, enjoying perfect records against the Arizona Cardinals (3–0), Baltimore Ravens (1–0), Carolina Panthers (1–0), Green Bay Packers (5–0), and Indianapolis Colts (5–0).

The Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer (MLS) were the final professional team to play in Mile High Stadium, their home from 1996 to 2001. The team had sought a soccer-specific stadium as early as 1999 due to the lack of control at Mile High. Team captain John Spencer became the first Rapids player to record a hat-trick during a 3–1 win against D.C. United on Independence Day 2000 in front of 60,500 fans, a team attendance record. The Rapids played the last professional sporting event ever held at Mile High on September 8, 2001, a 2–0 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy with 17,129 in attendance. The team were scheduled to move to Empower Field at Mile High for their season finale on September 12, but the match was postponed due to the September 11 attacks and ultimately cancelled.

Mile High Stadium was closed in 2001, after the Colorado Rapids and Denver Broncos moved to neighboring Empower Field at Mile High (then known as Invesco Field at Mile High), upon completion of the new stadium. The demolition of Mile High Stadium began in January 2002, an event covered extensively by local newspapers and broadcast live on television. The demolition was performed by Spirtas Wrecking Company of St. Louis, Missouri, the same group that led the demolition of arenas and stadiums in St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Seattle. Conventional demolition was chosen over implosion. The stadium demolition was completed by April.

The former stadium is now a parking lot for Empower Field at Mile High. A miniature replica of the stadium is in the parking lot. The historical site of many games and events for 40 years is marked by the hills forming the west and north stands, the corner between them descended by a staircase, much as the stands were. The location of home plate is identified by a marker located at .

==Notable events==

===Concerts===
June 27, 28 and 29, 1969, concert promoter Barry Fey held The Denver Pop Festival at Mile High Stadium with many well-known acts performing every evening. The city of Denver supported the festival and made available areas for camping and other services. The Denver Police however allowed non-ticket holders to enter the parking area whereupon they attempted to climb over chain link fencing to see the show while claiming that music should be &quot;free&quot;. Police responded by lobbing tear gas canisters toward the fences knowing full well that the gas would affect everyone in attendance at the outdoor venue. Sunday night&#x27;s final act was The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which proved to be the Experience&#x27; final performance as a trio as well. Bassist Noel Redding quit and simply flew back to England that night. Jimi did not perform again for 6 weeks until mid-August when he closed The Woodstock Music and Art Fair with his new band. Jimi Hendrix died 13 months later in September 1970.

Lynyrd Skynyrd played at the Stadium June 27, 1976, as part of their One More From The Road tour.

The Jacksons performed two concerts at Mile High Stadium on September 7 and 8, 1984, during their Victory Tour.

The stadium was the penultimate stop on Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band&#x27;s Born in the U.S.A. Tour, where they performed two shows on September 23 and 24, 1985.

The stadium hosted the final show of the 1988 Monsters of Rock Festival Tour, featuring Van Halen, Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come, on July 30, 1988. On June 28, 1991, the Grateful Dead performed in the stadium.

Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses brought the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the stadium on September 19, 1992, with Body Count as their opening act.

On October 21, 1992, U2 performed at Mile High as part of the third leg of their Zoo TV Tour. U2 would return again to perform in concert May 1, 1997, on the first leg of their PopMart Tour.

The stadium played host to Ozzfest on June 24, 1997. The stadium again hosted Ozzfest, for the second and last time, on June 21, 2001, and hosted the Area:One Festival on July 28, 2001.

===In film===
The stadium was featured in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2002 documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; as the backdrop for Moore&#x27;s interview with controversial rock musician Marilyn Manson during the 2001 Ozzfest tour.

===Other events===
In 1977 and 1978, Mile High Stadium hosted the Drum Corps International World Championships (with the 2004 championships held at the successor stadium). From 1963 to 2019, the Denver-based Blue Knights Drum &amp; Bugle Corps annually hosted Drums Along the Rockies, making it the single longest-running event held at the stadium and its successor aside from Denver Broncos football. Canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the event has since returned for the annual gathering, but has since moved to Colorado State University&#x27;s stadium in Fort Collins.

Billy Graham held his &quot;Rocky Mountain Crusade&quot; at the stadium in 1987.

In August 1993, Denver hosted World Youth Day. On August 12 and 13, Mile High Stadium hosted two events with Pope John Paul II, the Papal Welcoming Ceremony and the Way of the Cross.

The weekend of June 16 and 17, 1995, saw Mile High Stadium transform into a revival tent when it played host to the Promise Keepers, a male-only Evangelical Christian ministry co-founded in 1990 by Bill McCartney, former head coach for the University of Colorado, Boulder football organization (CU Buffs for short). Membership in the Promise Keepers had skyrocketed year-over-year, such that their previous venue Folsom Field (seating capacity 53,613), located on the University of Colorado, Boulder campus, had outgrown their needs. Mile High Stadium was chosen because it could accommodate the 70,000+ men and boys that would fill the stadium that weekend.

<doc id="758526" wikidata="Q435915" url="?curid=758526" title="Gunichi Mikawa">
<text>was a vice-admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. Mikawa was the commander of a heavy cruiser force that defeated the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy at the Battle of Savo Island in Ironbottom Sound on the night of 8–9 August 1942.

In this battle, his squadron of cruisers, plus one destroyer, sank three USN cruisers, plus the RAN heavy cruiser ; Mikawa&#x27;s force suffered no losses in the actual battle, although heavy cruiser was sunk by the undetected American submarine on the return to their base near Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago. However, his later career was of mixed success, and he was reassigned to lesser posts after the loss of a troop convoy destined for New Guinea. After the war Mikawa retired back to Japan, where he died in 1981 at the age of 92.

==Early career==
Mikawa was a native of Hiroshima prefecture. He graduated from the 38th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1910, ranked third of his class of 149 cadets. After midshipman service in the cruisers and , and battleships and , he attended Naval Torpedo and Gunnery Schools from 1913–1914. In late 1914, he joined the cruiser for World War I duty, including a cruise to China. This was followed by tours in the destroyer and transport &quot;Seito&quot; and studies at the Japanese Naval War College.

From 1919 to 1920, Lieutenant Mikawa was attached to the Japanese delegation to the post-war Versailles Peace Treaty Conference in France.

During the 1920s, Mikawa served as chief navigator on a number of ships, including the battleship and cruisers , , and &quot;Aso&quot;. He was subsequently an instructor at the Naval Torpedo School and held several other highly visible posts. At the end of the decade, Commander Mikawa was part of the delegation to the London Naval Treaty and shortly thereafter became naval attaché in Paris. Promoted to the rank of captain in late 1930, he returned to Japan to take up administrative and training duties.

He was commanding officer of the heavy cruisers and and the battleship in the mid-1930s. Mikawa was promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1936.

From 1 December 1936 – 15 November 1937, he was chief of staff of the IJN 2nd Fleet. Mikawa had duty with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and Imperial General Headquarters from 1937 to 1939, then went to sea again to command a succession of fleet squadrons, first in cruisers and then in battleships. He was promoted to vice admiral on 15 November 1940.

==World War II==
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mikawa was in command of Battleship Division 3 (BatDiv 3). He personally led the first section of his division as part of the screening force for the Pearl Harbor attack force, while the remaining battleships were sent south to cover the landings of Japanese troops in Malaya. Mikawa likewise led from the front during the Indian Ocean Raid and the Battle of Midway.

From 14 July 1942 to 1 April 1943, Mikawa commanded the newly formed IJN 8th Fleet in the South Pacific Ocean, based primarily at the major bases at Rabaul on the island of New Britain and Kavieng on New Ireland. During that time, he led Japanese naval forces involved in the Guadalcanal Campaign and the Solomon Islands Campaign. On the night of 8 to 9 August 1942, Mikawa commanded a force of heavy cruisers, plus one destroyer, that heavily defeated the U.S. Navy warship force, plus one Royal Australian Navy cruiser, in the Battle of Savo Island in Ironbottom Sound off Guadalcanal.

However, Mikawa was somewhat criticized by his superiors for his failure to aggressively follow up on his victory. He could have pursued to the south and attacked the fleet of unarmed American cargo transports that were at anchor, waiting until daybreak when they could continue delivering ammunition and supplies to the American 1st Marine Division, which had landed on Guadalcanal on 8 August 1942. Instead, Mikawa decided to turn northward and retire back to the safety of his base at Rabaul. Mikawa&#x27;s only ship that was sunk or badly damaged was the cruiser , which was torpedoed and sunk by the U.S. Navy submarine on their voyage back to Rabaul. However, after the war Mikawa maintained that based on the available intelligence there was an American carrier task force just south of the island of Guadalcanal, one that would surely launch an airstrike in the morning and inflict heavy loses to his fleet, not to mention that just before he set out he was specifically instructed by chief of IJN general staff Osami Nagano that he should avoid losing ships if possible and there simply wasn&#x27;t enough time left to both attack the transports and withdraw safety under the cover of darkness. Unbeknownst to him at the time however the American carriers have withdrawn south the evening prior and he was already out of their striking range. Therefore he did not believe he had made an incorrect decision in withdrawing from Savo Island based on the information available to him at that time.

On the night of 13 to 14 November 1942, Mikawa led a cruiser force that bombarded the critical American air base of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, but the next day lost one retreating heavy cruiser to air attacks originating there. Throughout the campaign for Guadalcanal, Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka often commanded the nighttime runs of the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, fast warships that delivered soldiers and supplies to Japanese Army force on Guadalcanal. However, Mikawa&#x27;s attempt to land Japanese reinforcements to the base of Lae on New Guinea turned into the disastrous (for the Japanese) Battle of the Bismarck Sea, one that involved only Japanese surface ships versus American and Royal Australian Air Force land-based airplanes.

Mikawa was soon forced to take responsibility for the loss of most of the Solomon Islands, and he was reassigned to rear areas, such as the Philippines. Admiral Mikawa also stated to the High Command of the IJN that fighting the Americans for the Solomon Islands was simply pouring Japanese soldiers, sailors, airmen, and ships into a &quot;black hole&quot;. Mikawa was correct about this, but his superiors in the IJN and the generals of the Japanese Army refused to listen to him.

Mikawa had Naval General Staff and other shore posts in Japan from April to September 1943. From 3 September 1943 to 18 June 1944, Mikawa commanded the 2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet in the Philippines. Afterwards, he commanded the very small &quot;Southwest Area Fleet&quot; and the very depleted &quot;13th Air Fleet&quot; from 18 June to 1 November 1944, also in the Philippines. By this time, the writing was on the wall that Japan faced only defeat after defeat until it would be forced to surrender. Reassigned to shore duty in Japan following the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, Mikawa retired from active duty with the IJN in May 1945.

===Massacre on board &quot;Akikaze&quot;===
In March 1943, the destroyer evacuated civilians from the Roman Catholic mission headquarters on Kairiru Island and also a group of missionaries from Wewak. The ~60 civilians, mostly German missionaries, their servants and dependents (including 3 infants), were then massacred on board the destroyer under orders that came from 8th Fleet HQ. As commander of the 8th Fleet at the time, Mikawa and his chief of staff Vice Admiral Shinzō Ōnishi are implicated in the war crime. At 8th Fleet HQ a Lieutenant Shigetoku Kami debriefed the captain of &quot;Akikaze&quot; after the massacre, he was the only staff officer whose name appeared in the testimony of Japanese witnesses. Mikawa and Ōnishi were interrogated after the war as the Australian War Crimes Section realized that the order to murder over 60 civilians could not have been given by a single low-ranking officer. 

Both admirals said that it was Kami, perhaps aided by another staff officer who was in charge of civilian affairs, who ordered the massacre independently. They also claimed that they were not aware of the massacre until after the fact. However, historian Yuki Tanaka writes that their claims are dubious when contrasted with wartime navy procedures in force when issuing orders. It was unlikely that communication officers of the 8th Fleet would agree to encrypt and deliver Kami&#x27;s order to the commander of &quot;Akikaze&quot;, if it did not bear the countersignatures of Mikawa and Ōnishi. In addition, the more junior officers involved in the massacre died during the war and could not corroborate their claims. In the opinion of Captain Albert Klestadt, a member of the investigation, even if the admirals did not issue the orders themselves, they had to accept command responsibility for being unable to prevent war crimes committed by subordinates.

==Postwar and final days==

After the war, Admiral Mikawa lived a long and rather quiet life in Japan, dying in 1981 at the age of 92.

Mikawa and the Long Lance torpedo were commemorated in 1992 by a commemorative postage stamp issued by the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mikawa&#x27;s character also appeared in the 1970 American/Japanese war film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, where he was portrayed by the Japanese actor Fujio Suga.

Commenting on Dutta&#x27;s career and her roles, Subhash K.

Dutta is known for her eloquent speaking skills. She has been a vocal supporter of the Me Too movement in India. Dutta stated that &quot;I think it is about time. It is fantastic as I feel the difference today is that women are standing up for women. I think that comes from a generation shift. The older generation was largely taught that women should be quiet and don&#x27;t speak up; that they don&#x27;t come to the forefront because they should be homemakers. Women today still do all of that. We always manage the home, take care of family, we are still the troubleshooters, we wear multiple hats in a day, we juggle a million works, and we don&#x27;t let any of them drop. But now this generation of women have become more vocal, and they are empowering each other, which is a much better situation. I cannot stress enough about how essential it is to have a sisterhood, to support other women that are speaking up.

<doc id="758532" wikidata="Q4871622" url="?curid=758532" title="Battle of Mabitac">
<text>The Battle of Mabitac (, ) was an engagement in the Philippine–American War, when on September 17, 1900, Filipinos under General Juan Cailles defeated an American force commanded by Colonel Benjamin F. Cheatham, Jr.

Mabitac was linked to the garrison town of Siniloan by a causeway which, on the day of the battle, was flooded with water (in many parts waist-deep). The water in the flanking rice fields was even deeper, making it impossible to properly deploy off the narrow road. Trenches occupied by Filipinos under Cailles cut across this causeway, blocking the path into Mabitac.

The battle began when elements of the 37th Infantry Regiment and 15th Infantry Regiment, advancing from Siniloan, came under intense fire some 400 yards from the enemy trenches, estimated at 800 in strength. Eight troops sent ahead to scout the enemy positions died to the last man as they closed to within 50 yards of the Filipinos. One of the last to fall was 2nd Lieutenant George Cooper. General Cailles, in an honorable gesture, let the defeated Cheatham recover the bodies of the eight slain soldiers after the battle.

Meanwhile, the main body of U.S. Infantry had become pinned down in the waist-deep mud, still several hundred yards from the Filipino trenches. Unable to properly deploy, and in a dangerously exposed position, they engaged in a firefight with Philippine forces for nearly 90 minutes. Despite the bravery of one Captain John E. Moran, later awarded the Medal of Honor for trying to rally his demoralized comrades, the Americans were badly mauled, sustaining scores of casualties.

Even supporting fire from a U.S. Navy gunboat (some 1,300 yards distant) and an attempted flank attack by 60 Americans, who had not participated in the costly frontal assault, could not dent the Filipino position, and Cheatham withdrew soon after. Eventually, General Cailles managed a skillful withdrawal in order to avoid envelopment, and by the next day, his entire command had made good their escape.

According to the Americans the US Army lost some 21 killed and 23 wounded in the battle, an effective loss of 33% of their strength (termed a &quot;profoundly impressive loss&quot; by American Brigadier General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. in an effort to allay the potential shock on U.S. servicemen). American estimates put Filipino losses at 11 killed and 20 wounded. Numbered among their dead was Lieutenant Colonel Fidel Sario.

A differing version of the battle exists in the Philippine Revolutionary Records. A letter addressed to a Miguel Estrada by one Faustin Pantua says this:

American Major General John C. Bates later said of this battle: &quot;It is deemed charitable as well as politic to drop a veil over this matter rather than to give any publicity that can be avoided.&quot;

After this First Battle of Mabitac in 1900, a second battle was fought here during the Second World War in 1945. The town was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Army by the Philippine Commonwealth troops of the 4th, 41st, 42nd and 43rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and the 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary with some guerrilla elements.

<text>The Fend Flitzer was a three-wheeled invalid carriage designed and built by Fritz Fend. The Flitzer established many of the basic concepts on which Fend&#x27;s later Messerschmitt Kabinenroller microcars were developed.

==Background==
In 1948, Fend, a former aeronautical engineer and technical officer in the Luftwaffe, began production of a tricycle invalid carriage in his workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. The tricycle had a front wheel that was steered by handlebars and powered by a mechanism actuated by pushing back and forth on the handlebars. Shortly afterward, it was offered with a Victoria two-stroke proprietary engine normally used for motorizing bicycles.

Fend then designed the Flitzer, a larger, better-enclosed invalid carriage. It was designed from the start to be powered by a gasoline engine. Whereas the earlier tricycle was both steered and powered by a single front wheel, the Flitzer had a pair of front wheels linked to the steering mechanism and a powered rear wheel.

The Flitzer was made with aluminium panels over a steel frame and was enclosed at the front, sides, and back. It had a hatch at the top that was hinged at the front and tilted forward for the operator to get in. The first version of the Flitzer was open, with a hole and a windshield in the hatch for the operator&#x27;s head and shoulders to stick through and be protected from the wind. Flitzers made from September 1948 into 1950 were powered by a Fichtel &amp; Sachs two-stroke engine. Suspension was by rubber springs loaded in torsion.

In 1950 the engine was changed to a Riedel/Imme engine. By 1951, in response to customer requests for passenger-carrying capability, a scooter-type saddle was placed above the rear enclosure with footrests on either side of the body. A closed version, on which the hatch had an enclosure that covered the operator, was made available. The enclosure included the windshield and side windows.

==Reception and legacy==

About 250 Flitzers had been built when production stopped in 1951. Many of these invalid carriages had been bought by able-bodied individuals seeking basic personal transport. This led Fend to believe that there would be a mass market for a larger, transport-oriented version of the Flitzer. Fend began to design and develop a two-seat vehicle similar in concept to the Flitzer. He also began looking for a manufacturer to mass-produce this vehicle. He came to an agreement with Messerschmitt for them to build Fend vehicles in their factory at Regensburg Part of the agreement was that the cars carried the Messerschmitt name, with Fend&#x27;s new design being designated the Messerschmitt KR175.

<text>John Lee Curtis &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson (March 30, 1914 – June 1, 1948) was an American blues harmonica player and singer-songwriter. He is often regarded as the pioneer of the blues harp as a solo instrument. He played on hundreds of recordings by many pre–World War II blues artists. Under his own name, he was one of the most recorded blues musicians of the 1930s and 1940s and is closely associated with Chicago producer Lester Melrose and Bluebird Records. His popular songs, original or adapted, include &quot;Good Morning, School Girl&quot;, &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;, &quot;Early in the Morning&quot;, and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;.

Williamson&#x27;s harmonica style was a great influence on postwar performers. Later in his career, he was a mentor to many up-and-coming blues musicians who moved to Chicago, including Muddy Waters. In an attempt to capitalize on Williamson&#x27;s fame, Aleck &quot;Rice&quot; Miller began recording and performing as Sonny Boy Williamson in the early 1940s, and later, to distinguish the two, John Lee Williamson came to be known as Sonny Boy Williamson I or &quot;the original Sonny Boy&quot;.

==Biography and career==
Williamson was born in Madison County, Tennessee, near Jackson, in 1914. His original recordings are in the country blues style, but he soon demonstrated skill at making the harmonica a lead instrument for the blues and popularized it for the first time in a more urban blues setting. He has been called &quot;the father of modern blues harp&quot;. While in his teens he joined Yank Rachell and Sleepy John Estes, playing with them in Tennessee and Arkansas. In 1934 he settled in Chicago.

Williamson first recorded in 1937, for Bluebird Records, and his first recording, &quot;Good Morning, School Girl&quot;, became a standard. He was popular among black audiences throughout the southern United States and in Midwestern industrial cities, such as Detroit and Chicago, and his name was synonymous with the blues harmonica for the next decade. Other well-known recordings of his include &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;, &quot;Shake the Boogie&quot;, &quot;Better Cut That Out&quot;, &quot;Sloppy Drunk&quot;, &quot;Early in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;, and &quot;Hoodoo Hoodoo&quot; (also known as &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot;). In 1947, &quot;Shake the Boogie&quot; made number 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Race Records chart. Williamson&#x27;s style influenced many blues harmonica performers, including Billy Boy Arnold, Junior Wells, Sonny Terry, Little Walter, and Snooky Pryor. He was the most widely heard and influential blues harmonica player of his generation. His music was also influential on many of his non-harmonica-playing contemporaries and successors, including Muddy Waters (who played guitar with Williamson in the mid-1940s) and Jimmy Rogers (whose first recording in 1946 was as a harmonica player, performing an uncanny imitation of Williamson&#x27;s style). These and other artists, both blues and rock, have helped popularize his songs through subsequent recordings.

Williamson recorded prolifically both as a bandleader and as a sideman over the course of his career, mainly for Bluebird. Before Bluebird moved to Chicago, where it eventually became part of RCA Records, many early sessions took place at the Leland Tower, a hotel in Aurora, Illinois. The top-floor nightclub at the Leland, known as the Sky Club, was used for live broadcasts of big bands on a local radio station and, during off hours, served as a recording studio for Williamson&#x27;s early sessions and those of other Bluebird artists.

==Death and legacy==
Williamson&#x27;s final recording session took place in Chicago in December 1947, in which he accompanied Big Joe Williams. On June 1, 1948, Williamson was killed in a robbery on Chicago&#x27;s South Side as he walked home from a performance at the Plantation Club, at 31st St. and Giles Avenue, a tavern just a block and a half from his home, at 3226 S. Giles. Williamson&#x27;s final words are reported to have been &quot;Lord have mercy&quot;.

Williamson is buried at the former site of the Blairs Chapel Church, southwest of Jackson, Tennessee. In 1991, a red granite marker was purchased by fans and family to mark the site of his burial. A Tennessee historical marker, also placed in 1991, indicates the place of his birth and describes his influence on blues music.

==Name issues==
His legacy has been somewhat overshadowed in the postwar blues era by the popularity of the musician who appropriated his name, Rice Miller. The recordings made by Williamson between 1937 and his death in 1948 and those made later by Rice Miller were all originally issued under the name Sonny Boy Williamson. It is believed that Miller adopted the name to deceive audiences (and his first record label) into thinking that he was the &quot;original&quot; Sonny Boy. In order to differentiate between the two musicians, many later scholars and biographers have referred to John Lee Williamson (1914–1948) as Sonny Boy Williamson I and Miller (c. 1912–1965) as Sonny Boy Williamson II.

To add to the confusion, around 1940 the jazz pianist and singer Enoch Williams recorded for Decca under the name Sonny Boy Williams and in 1947 as Sunny Boy in the Sunny Boy Trio.

Specialty labels, such as JSP Records, Saga, Indigo, Snapper, and others, have also released compilations. In 1991, Document Records issued Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Complete Recorded Works In Chronological Order&quot; as five CDs.

<text>Joachim Winkelhock (born 24 October 1960) is a German motor racing driver.

The younger brother of the late Manfred Winkelhock, Winkelhock was born in Waiblingen, near Stuttgart. The youngest brother, Thomas Winkelhock, and Manfred&#x27;s son Markus Winkelhock are also racing drivers.

==Career==
Winkelhock started in the one-make Renault 5 Cup in 1979 but it would be almost a decade before he found his first major success, by winning the 1988 German Formula Three Championship as well as that year&#x27;s F3 European Cup (at the unusually late age of 28). He progressed the following year to Formula One with the small French AGS team, who paired him with his future touring car rival Gabriele Tarquini; Winklehock&#x27;s brief time in F1 was unsuccessful, failing to pre-qualify the car on 7 occasions. His reputation however remained strong enough that he was subsequently hired by BMW Motorsport for German&#x27;s premier touring car racing series the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, first for the Bigazzi and then Schnitzer teams. He finished 6th, 7th and 8th in the final standings and scored three wins in total during his three years in the series, as well as winning the 1990 and 1991 24 Hours of Nürburgring races for BMW and Schnitzer.
When BMW exited the DTM at the end of 1992 Winkelhock moved with the manufacturer and Schnitzer to the British Touring Car Championship, where he and teammate Steve Soper dominated the first half of the 1993 season. The pair took 7 wins from the first 8 rounds (Winklehock four, Soper three). Although the second half of the year was more challenging for Winkelhock, seeing him earn only one more win, he was still eventually crowned champion. During his time in Britain, he was also commonly known as &quot;Smokin&#x27; Jo&quot; for his cigarette smoking habit. Winkelhock&#x27;s next win was the 1994 Asia Pacific Touring Car Championship, and in 1995 he won the German Supertouring Championship (STW). He also triumphed in the 1995 Spa 24 Hours, and the 1994 and 1998 Macau Grand Prix&#x27;s Guia touring car races. His last success for BMW came at the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, which he won driving the BMW V12 LMR prototype run by Schnitzer Motorsport.

In 2000, Winkelhock joined Opel in the new Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (a revived version of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, which had been defunct since 1995). In his first season in the new DTM Winkelhock was competitive, winning at the Norisring and finishing 5th in the final standings. However, the collapse in Opel&#x27;s fortunes in DTM after 2000 saw a consequent decline in Winkelhock&#x27;s fortunes and after a 2003 season in which he only scored a single point, he announced his retirement from motor racing at the age of 43.

He runs his family&#x27;s Waiblingen-based truck-crane and towing business, occasionally getting personally involved in recovering crashed trucks.

A special edition of the BMW M5 has been made in honor of Joachim Winkelhock.

A 2005 poll run by &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine voted Winkelhock the 16th greatest touring car driver ever. Winkelhock is nicknamed &quot;Smokin&#x27; Jo&quot;.

<text>Laurence Henry Tribe (born October 10, 1941) is an American legal scholar known for his studies of United States constitutional law. Tribe was a professor at Harvard Law School from 1968 until his retirement in 2020. He currently holds the position of Carl M. Loeb University Professor Emeritus.

A constitutional law scholar, Tribe is co-founder of the American Constitution Society. He is also the author of &quot;American Constitutional Law&quot; (1978), a major treatise in that field, and has argued before the United States Supreme Court 36 times. Tribe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2010.

==Personal life and education==
Tribe was born in 1941 in Shanghai, which was then part of the Republic of China but had been taken over by the Empire of Japan in 1937 following the Battle of Shanghai. He was the son of Paulina (&quot;née&quot; Diatlovitsky) and George Israel Tribe. His family is Jewish. His father was from Poland and his mother was born in Harbin to immigrants from Eastern Europe. Tribe spent his early years in the French Concession of Shanghai before his family immigrated to the United States when he was six years old. His family settled in San Francisco, and he attended Abraham Lincoln High School.

After graduating from high school in 1958 at age 16, Tribe went to Harvard University, where he majored in mathematics and was a member of the Harvard Debate Team that won the intercollegiate National Debate Tournament in 1961. He graduated from Harvard in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

Tribe then received a National Science Foundation fellowship to pursue doctoral studies in mathematics at Harvard, but dropped out after one year. He decided to attend the Harvard Law School instead, where he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. He graduated from Harvard Law in 1966 with a Juris Doctor &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

Tribe married Carolyn Ricarda Kreye in 1964. They divorced in 2008. Their two children, Mark and Kerry, are visual artists.

On May 22, 2013, he was presented with an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Columbia University during its Class of 2013 commencement.

==Career==
After graduating from law school, Tribe clerked for justice Mathew Tobriner of the Supreme Court of California from 1966 to 1967, then for justice Potter Stewart of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1967 to 1968. He then joined the Harvard Law School faculty as an assistant professor, receiving tenure in 1972. Among his law students and research assistants while on the faculty at Harvard have been former President Barack Obama (a research assistant for over two years), Chief Justice John Roberts, US Senator Ted Cruz, former D.C. Circuit Chief Judge and Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Associate Justice Elena Kagan. Other notable students of Tribe were U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, Chair of the House Intelligence Committee and lead manager for the first Impeachment of Donald Trump, and Jamie Raskin, lead manager for the second Donald Trump impeachment.

In 1978, Tribe published the first version of what has become one of the core texts on its subject, &quot;American Constitutional Law&quot;. It has since been updated and expanded a number of times.

In 1983, Tribe represented Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon in the appeal of his federal conviction on income tax charges.

Tribe represented the restaurant Grendel&#x27;s Den in the case &quot;Larkin v. Grendel&#x27;s Den, Inc.&quot;, in which the restaurant challenged a Massachusetts law that allowed religious establishments to prohibit liquor sales in neighboring properties. The case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1982 and the court overturned the law as violating the separation of church and state. &quot;The Lawyer&#x27;s Guide to Writing Well&quot; criticizes the opening of his brief as a &quot;thicket of confusing citations and unnecessary definitions&quot; stating that it would have been &quot;measurably strengthened&quot; if he had used the &quot;more lively imagery&quot; that he had used in a footnote later in the document.

In the 1985 &quot;National Gay Task Force v. Board of Education&quot; Supreme Court case, Tribe represented the National Gay Task Force who had won an Appeals Court ruling against an Oklahoma law that would have allowed schools to fire teachers who were attracted to people of the same sex or spoke in favor of civil rights for gay people. The Supreme Court deadlocked, which left the Appeals Court&#x27;s favorable ruling in place, declaring the law would have violated the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court ruled against Tribe&#x27;s client in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; in 1986 and held that a Georgia state law criminalizing sodomy, as applied to consensual acts between persons of the same sex, did not violate fundamental liberties under the principle of substantive due process. However, in 2003 the Supreme Court overruled &quot;Bowers&quot; in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, a case for which Tribe wrote the ACLU&#x27;s amicus curiae brief supporting Lawrence, who was represented by Lambda Legal.
Tribe testified at length during the Senate confirmation hearings in 1987 about the Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, arguing that Bork&#x27;s stand on the limitation of rights in the Constitution would be unique in the history of the Court. His participation in the hearings raised his profile outside of the legal realm and he became a target of right-wing critics. His phone was later found to have been wiretapped, but it has never been discovered who had placed the device or why.

Tribe&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Abortion: Clash of Absolutes&quot;, was called &quot;informative, lucidly written and cogently reasoned&quot; in a review in the &quot;Journal&quot; of the American Bar Association.

In 1992, Tribe reargued &quot;Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.&quot;, before the Supreme Court on behalf of Cipollone.

Tribe was part of Al Gore&#x27;s legal team regarding the results of the 2000 United States presidential election. Due to the close nature of the vote count, recounts had been initiated in Florida, and the recounts had been challenged in court. Tribe argued the initial case in Federal Court in Miami in which they successfully argued that the court should not stop the recount of the votes which was taking place and scheduled to take place in certain counties. David Boies argued for the Gore team in a related matter in the Florida State Courts regarding the dates that Secretary of State of Florida Katherine Harris would accept recounts. When the original Federal case, &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, was appealed, Gore and his advisers decided at the last minute to have Boies instead of Tribe argue the case at the Supreme Court. The court determined that recounts of votes should cease and that accordingly George W. Bush had been elected president.

Since the mid-1990s, Tribe has represented a number of corporations advocating for their free speech rights and constitutional personhood. Tribe represented General Electric in its defense against its liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&quot;Superfund&quot;), in which GE and Tribe unsuccessfully argued that the act unconstitutionally violated General Electric&#x27;s due process rights.

In 2014, Tribe was retained to represent Peabody Energy in a suit against the Environmental Protection Agency. Tribe argued that EPA&#x27;s use of the Clean Air Act to implement its Clean Power Plan was unconstitutional. Tribe&#x27;s legal analysis has been criticized by other legal commentators, including fellow Harvard Law School professors Richard J. Lazarus and Jody Freeman, who described his conclusion as &quot;wholly without merit&quot;. His advocacy for corporations like Peabody has been criticized by some legal experts.

On September 25, 2020, Tribe was named as one of the 25 members of the &quot;Real Facebook Oversight Board&quot;, an independent monitoring group over Facebook.

==Political involvement==
Tribe is one of the co-founders of the liberal American Constitution Society, the law and policy organization formed to counter the conservative Federalist Society, and is one of a number of scholars at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for animal rights.

Tribe served as a judicial adviser to Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. In February 2010, he was named &quot;Senior Counselor for Access to Justice&quot; in the Department of Justice. He resigned eight months later, citing health reasons.

In December 2016, Tribe and notable lawyers Lawrence Lessig and Andrew Dhuey established The Electors Trust under the aegis of Equal Citizens. They provide pro bono legal counsel as well as a secure communications platform for those of the 538 members of the United States Electoral College who were considering a vote of conscience against Donald Trump in the presidential election.

After the dismissal of James Comey in May 2017, Tribe wrote: &quot;The time has come for Congress to launch an impeachment investigation of President Trump for obstruction of justice.&quot; Tribe argued that Trump&#x27;s conduct rose to the level of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; that are impeachable offenses under the Constitution. He added: &quot;It will require serious commitment to constitutional principle, and courageous willingness to put devotion to the national interest above self-interest and party loyalty, for a Congress of the president&#x27;s own party to initiate an impeachment inquiry.&quot;

Tribe is on the board of the Renew Democracy Initiative, an American political organization founded in 2017 to promote and defend liberal democracy in the U.S. and abroad.

In 2004, Tribe acknowledged having plagiarized several phrases and a sentence in his 1985 book, &quot;God Save this Honorable Court&quot;, from a 1974 book by Henry Abraham. After an investigation, Tribe was reprimanded by Harvard for &quot;a significant lapse in proper academic practice,&quot; but the investigation concluded that Tribe did not intend to plagiarize.

Tribe has stirred controversy due to his promotion of conspiracy theories about Donald Trump&#x27;s fitness for the presidency. Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan harshly criticized Tribe, saying that he &quot;has become an important vector of misinformation and conspiracy theories on Twitter.&quot; According to McKay Coppins of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Tribe has been &quot;an especially active booster&quot; of the Palmer Report, &quot;a liberal blog known for peddling conspiracy theories&quot;. Tribe removed the posted tweets following the Palmer Report and contests the accuracy of the story of controversy.

On August 8, 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Kenneth Chesebro, who initially laid out &quot;a plot to use false slates of electors to subvert the 2020 election&quot;, referred to comments by Tribe, to which Tribe responded that his referred comments were &quot;a gross misrepresentation of my scholarship” by Chesebro, and were &quot;taken out of context&quot;.

On August 19, 2023, several legal constitutional scholars, including conservative legal scholar J. Michael Luttig and Tribe, have argued that the former U.S. President Donald Trump is now barred from presidential office under section 3 of the 14th Amendment because of his alleged support for the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

In 2025, Tribe argued that the power that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency attempt to exercise over the US federal government is illegal. Tribe says that Musk &quot;absolutely&quot; faces a conflict of interest in his roles as a government contractor and federal employee.

==Cases==

The following is a list of cases Tribe has argued in the Supreme Court, as of the end of 2005:
Tribe has argued 26 cases in the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals:

<text>Narrabeen is a beachside suburb of northern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 23 kilometres northeast of the business district, shared by the local government area of Northern Beaches Council and the Northern Beaches region. The bay was named Broken Bay by James Cook as he sailed past.

==History==
There are a number of theories on the origin of the name &quot;Narrabeen&quot;. The most fanciful is that Narrabeen is named after &quot;narrow beans&quot; which the English in the first year of settlement (1788) found and ate from a vine growing over beach sand. Surgeon White indeed recorded getting ill from such beans but this was well north of Narrabeen, near Broken Bay. The name Narrobine Creek appears in 1801 in records relating to two escaped convicts, and thus the name appears to have been in use before then. Another suggestion is that it derives from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;swan&quot;.

Surveyor James Meehan placed the name Narabang Narabang Lagoon on a map in 1814 and thought the word meant swan. According to The Budawa Aboriginal Signage Group Inc., Narrabeen means &quot;source of fresh water&quot;. The most popular theory involves Captain Henry Reynolds, a first fleeter who took his family to live near the Narrabeen Lagoon. They were all massacred by escaped convicts turned bushrangers, who burned their homestead. The location was then named after the young Aboriginal girl Narrabine/Narrabeen who tried to assist the victims and helped soldiers capture the killers.

The first land grants were made to John Lees (), Philip Schaffer (), and James Wheeler () all along the south bank of Mullet Creek. Alex Macdonald was granted at the beach in 1815 and west of this land JT Collins had by 1857.

During the nineteenth century, travellers had to ford the lake until 1880 when the first bridge opened. A second bridge at the mouth of the lagoon in Ocean Street was built in 1925. Narrabeen Post Office opened on 1 August 1898. Narrabeen North Post Office opened on 19 August 1926 and closed in 1984.
With the extension of the tram to Narrabeen in 1913 providing easier transport, the whole area around the lake became popular for holidays and camping. A large camping ground became established on the north shore of the lagoon. In 1946 the Wakehurst Parkway was opened to North Narrabeen connecting the whole Pittwater area directly to Frenchs Forest and Seaforth. Narrabeen East Post Office opened on 2 June 1947, was renamed Narrabeen Peninsula in November that year and closed in 1965.

In January 2005, workmen excavating beside the bus shelter on Ocean Street at Octavia Street found a skeleton, which subsequent investigation revealed to be 4,000-year-old remains of a man. He has become known as Narrabeen Man.

==Population==
In the , there were 8,255 people in Narrabeen. 71% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.8%, Brazil 2.2%, New Zealand 2.0%. 84.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Portuguese at 2.6%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.1%, Catholic 23.2% and Anglican 17.4%.

==Beaches==
There are four beaches along the Narrabeen stretch of beach, North Narrabeen, Narrabeen, South Narrabeen and Collaroy beach. Although Collaroy is a separate suburb, its beach lies along the same stretch. All beaches have their own Surf Life Saving Club. Narrabeen beach is mentioned in the Beach Boys song &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, which in their live concert on 28 November 1992 at North Narrabeen Reserve they performed at the end of the encore. It remains an internationally recognised premier surfing beach. Writing celebrating this beach is featured in &quot;Guide to Sydney Beaches&quot; Meuse Press. It suffers regular challenges from storm damage and beach erosion. The grassy parts of the beaches are situated on the endangered Themeda Grassland ecological community.

==Lagoon and catchment==
Narrabeen lagoon is fed by Deep Creek, Middle Creek, Mullet Creek, Narrabeen Creek and Nareen Creek, and occupies about 2.2 square kilometres, and has a catchment of about 55 square kilometres. The catchment of Narrabeen Lagoon consist of just under half bushland, one quarter parks, sports fields and rural lands, with the remainder being used for residential or industrial purposes, and Garigal National Park making up a third of the bushland. Despite the significant urban impact there are some twenty six vegetation communities to be found within the catchment, some of which are not found in either Garigal nor its neighbouring Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, in particular, &quot;Blackbutt -Turpentine Forest&quot; and &quot;Angophora - White Mahogany Forest&quot;, both of which are components of the &quot;Duffys Forest&quot; endangered ecological community. (See Duffys Forest Ecological community.) Most of the remnant ecological communities within the catchment have been defined as endangered ecological communities (EECs), e.g., &quot;Swamp Mahogany Forest&quot; is a component of &quot;Swamp Sclerophyll Forest&quot;, &quot;Coastal Freshwater Wetland&quot; a component of &quot;Freshwater Wetlands on Coastal Floodplains&quot;
both declared as EECs, see the List of endangered ecological communities in NSW and Native Vegetation (2016). Narrabeen Lagoon Trail is an path around the lagoon.

==Sport and recreation==
The Sydney Institute of Sport is based in Narrabeen and has recently become the headquarters of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles rugby league club. North Narrabeen beach is commonly used for surfing competitions.

== Education==
Narrabeen is home to two public primary schools (Narrabeen Lakes and North Narrabeen), St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and the public Narrabeen Sports High School.

==Jim Somerville Bridge==
James Graham Somerville, an environmentalist, is commemorated by the Jim Somerville Bridge on the Narrabeen Lagoon Trail.

<doc id="758555" wikidata="Q3557501" url="?curid=758555" title="Vic Power">
<text>Victor Felipe Pellot Pové (November 1, 1927November 29, 2005), known professionally as Vic Power, was a Puerto Rican professional baseball first baseman. He played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles / California Angels, and Philadelphia Phillies, from 1954 through 1965. Pellot was the second Puerto Rican of African descent to play in MLB and the second Puerto Rican to play in the American League (AL), following Hiram Bithorn.

Pellot used the name Vic Power during his major league career, but played as Victor Pellot when he played winter baseball in Puerto Rico. He was an AL All-Star for four seasons playing in five of the six All-Star games that were played, and won seven consecutive Gold Glove Awards.

==Early life==
Born Victor Felipe Pellot Pové, Pellot was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the second child in a family of six (Pové was his mother&#x27;s maiden name while Pellot was his father&#x27;s surname, as is traditional in Hispanic culture, such as Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker). However, when his mother, Maximina Pové, was in the first grade, her teacher changed her last name, changing the &quot;v&quot; to a &quot;w&quot; and adding an &quot;r&quot; at the end due to believing she was too illiterate to spell her own name, and Pové became Power. Power showed an interest in baseball at a young age, but his father didn&#x27;t want him to play baseball and would punish him if he caught him doing so. When he was thirteen years old, his father died and it was only then that he was able to play the game he loved. His mother moved to the city of Caguas, there he attended and graduated from José Gautier Benítez High School.

In 1946 Pellot started to practice with a local baseball team called the &quot;Senadores de San Juan&quot; (San Juan Senators) and learned many of his baseball skills. He was later invited to play for the &quot;Criollos de Caguas&quot;, where he was spotted by a New York Yankees scout. In 1949, he left for the City of Chicago and went to play for a minor league team in Drummondville, Quebec.

==Minor leagues==
Pellot was signed by the Yankees in 1951, and sent to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League. In 1952, Pellot played for the Kansas City Blues of the Class AAA American Association, where he led the league in doubles and triples, while posting a .331 batting average. The next season, Pellot led the league with a .349 batting average. However, despite his skills he was not invited to spring training in either year.

The Yankees&#x27; owners at the time, Del Webb and Dan Topping, felt that Power&#x27;s playing style and personality wasn&#x27;t suited for the conservative style that they wanted a &quot;black&quot; player to represent as a member of the club. Power dated light-skinned women, leading George Weiss, the general manager of the Yankees, to say that Pellot was &quot;not the Yankee type&quot;. The Yankees also had Johnny Mize at first base, and another top prospect, Bill Skowron, in their farm system. Skowron spent most of the 1953 season at first base, while Pellot played 121 games in the outfield. When the Yankees had a need at the major league level, they promoted Gus Triandos, a Caucasian player from Class AA, instead of Pellot. The Yankees decided on Elston Howard to become the first black player in club history. Many blacks and Puerto Ricans protested in front of Yankee Stadium in response to what they believed to have been a racially motivated decision.

==MLB career==
On December 16, 1953, Pellot was traded by the Yankees, along with Don Bollweg, Jim Finigan, Johnny Gray, Bill Renna, Jim Robertson, and $25,000 to the Philadelphia Athletics for Loren Babe, Harry Byrd, Tom Hamilton, Carmen Mauro and Eddie Robinson, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to play for that team. Suffering from the racial discrimination which was rampant in the nation during that time, Pellot could neither stay with the rest of the team at the same hotels nor be allowed to eat at the same restaurants as his white teammates. The Athletics moved to Kansas City in 1955, where he finished in second place in the batting race.
Pellot is one of only six batters, as of August 7, 2010, to have hit both a leadoff and walk-off home run in the same game (having done so in 1957), the others being Billy Hamilton (1893), Darin Erstad (2000), Reed Johnson (2003), Ian Kinsler (2009), and Chris Young (2010).

In 1958, Pellot was sent to the Cleveland Indians. During his 12-year career, he played with the Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics (1954–58), Cleveland Indians (1958–61), Minnesota Twins (1962–64), Los Angeles Angels (1964), Philadelphia Phillies (1964), and California Angels (1965).

Before retiring, Pellot won seven consecutive Gold Glove Awards from when the award was first introduced in 1958 to 1964. He made the American League All-Star team with the Kansas City Athletics in 1955 and 1956 and the Cleveland Indians in 1959 and 1960 (two games were played both seasons). Pellot was also voted the Minnesota Twins Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1962. He has the record of having made one or more assists in 16 consecutive game as a first baseman. At the age of 36, he won his final Gold Glove Award to be the oldest player to win the award at first base; this record was not surpassed until Yuli Gurriel won the first base Gold Glove at 37 in 2021.

He shares the record of making two unassisted double plays in one game, and he is one of 11 players to steal home plate twice in one game, and he also shares the record of being assists leader for six years in a row and of double plays in a single game. Among his career totals are the following: 1,716 hits and 126 home runs, and he was only struck out 247 times out of 6,046 at bats.

==Name history==
In a letter to historian Bill Haber in 1993, Pellot gave his real, full name as Victor Felipe Pellot Pove; Pove being his mother&#x27;s maiden name and Pellot his father&#x27;s surname (as is traditional in Hispanic culture; see Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker). However, when his mother, Maximina Pove, was in the first grade, her teacher changed her last name, changing the &quot;v&quot; to a &quot;w&quot; and adding an &quot;r&quot; at the end.

During Pellot&#x27;s first two professional seasons, in the French-Canadian town of Drummondville, Quebec, he went by his birth name, Victor Pellot. However, Pellot noticed that the mostly French-speaking crowd began to laugh whenever his name was announced. Initially, he surmised that the crowd was laughing because he was black. This turned out to be incorrect, and Pellot soon learned that the real source of the laughter was not his race, but his last name: the similar-sounding word &quot;plotte&quot; is slang for &quot;vagina&quot; in the Quebec French. In response, he played under the name of &quot;Vic Power.&quot; He kept the name after getting promoted to the majors in United States, but retained &quot;Pellot&quot; when playing winter ball in Puerto Rico.

==Later years==
Pellot spent his retirement in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. The city built a ballpark, which he could see from the window of his apartment, and named it &quot;Parque Victor Pellot&quot; (Victor Pellot Park), after him. During the summers, he helped youngsters develop their baseball skills in both Puerto Rico and San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic. According to historian Bill James, Pellot was probably a main reason why San Pedro de Macorís became &quot;the world&#x27;s richest source of baseball talent&quot;. Pellot died on November 29, 2005, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico from cancer, at the age of 78. He was buried at Porta Coeli Cemetery in Bayamón Puerto Rico.

==Legacy==
Pellot has been considered by many Puerto Ricans to be one of the island&#x27;s greatest baseball players, a legend only surpassed by Roberto Clemente. In 2005, he spoke about his baseball career in the American documentary &quot;Beisbol&quot;, directed by Alan Swyer and narrated by Esai Morales, which covers the early influences and contributions of Hispanics to baseball. In 2000, the Cleveland Indians honored him by declaring him to be among its 100 all-time greatest players. He was named the 81st greatest first baseman in Major League history by historian Bill James in his book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;.

Pellot&#x27;s unorthodox and often flashy approach to fielding first base proved over the years to be very influential. Although at the time he was often criticized by the press and his peers for fielding the ball using only one hand instead of two, stating it was &quot;flamboyance&quot;, this would later become his trademark move. More importantly, it anticipated a change in how the position is played: nowadays, virtually all first basemen field the ball one-handed (this because it increases their reach and provides for greater flexibility).

Pellot is also remembered by baseball historians and fans for his sharp wit and dark, deadpan humor, a lot of which was directed at the racism and segregation he experienced during spring training in the southern United States. One of the more celebrated examples of his dark wit by which Pellot subverted the ugly rejection experienced through institutionalized racism, documented in David Maraniss&#x27;s biography of Roberto Clemente, has Pellot entering a whites-only (segregated) restaurant while playing for Syracuse. Upon being told by the waitress that the restaurant didn&#x27;t serve &quot;Negroes&quot;, Pellot promptly told the waitress not to worry, that he didn&#x27;t eat &quot;Negroes&quot;.

<text>Sir Aaron Klug (11 August 1926 – 20 November 2018) was a British biophysicist and chemist. He was a winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his development of crystallographic electron microscopy and his structural elucidation of biologically important nucleic acid-protein complexes.

==Early life and education==

Klug was born in Želva, in Lithuania, to Jewish parents Lazar, a cattleman, and Bella (née Silin) Klug, with whom he emigrated to South Africa at the age of two. He was educated at Durban High School. Paul de Kruif&#x27;s 1926 book, &quot; Microbe Hunters&quot;, aroused his interest in microbiology.

Klug was part of the Hashomer Hatzair Jewish Zionist youth movement in South Africa.

He started to study microbiology, but then moved into physics and maths, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of the Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg. He studied physics under Reginald W. James and obtained his Master of Science degree at the University of Cape Town. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, which enabled him to move to England, completing his PhD in research physics at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1953.

==Career and research==
Following his PhD, Klug moved to Birkbeck College in the University of London in late 1953, and started working with chemist and X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin in the lab of crystallographer John Bernal. This experience aroused a lifelong interest in the study of viruses, and during his time there he made discoveries in the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus. In 1962 he moved to the newly built Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge. Over the following decade Klug used methods from X-ray diffraction, microscopy and structural modelling to develop crystallographic electron microscopy in which a sequence of two-dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to produce three-dimensional images of the target. He studied the structure of transfer RNA, and found what is known as zinc fingers as well as the neurofibrils in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Also in 1962, Klug became a Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was later made an Honorary Fellow of the college.

Between 1986 and 1996, Klug was director of the LMB. He served on the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. He also served on the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute.
He and Dai Rees approached the Wellcome Trust to found the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which was a key player in the Human Genome Project.

===Awards and honours===
Klug was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1981. He was knighted by Elizabeth II in 1988. In 1969 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), the oldest national scientific institution in the world. He was elected its President (PRS) from 1995 to 2000. He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1995 – as is customary for Presidents of the Royal Society. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: 

Klug was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society

In 2000, Klug received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2005, he was awarded South Africa&#x27;s Order of Mapungubwe (gold) for exceptional achievements in medical science. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci), also in 2005.

In 2013, Israel&#x27;s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev dedicated their centre for structural biology in Klug&#x27;s name, &quot;Aaron Klug Integrated Centre for Biomolecular Structure&quot;. He, his family and the then-British Ambassador to Israel Matthew Gould, were in attendance. Klug was associated with the university and the town of Be&#x27;er Sheva, having visited them numerous times.

==Personal life==
Klug married Liebe Bobrow in 1948; they had two sons, one of whom predeceased them in 2000. He died on 20 November 2018 in Cambridge.

Though Klug had faced discrimination in South Africa, he remained religious and according to Sydney Brenner, he became more religious in his older age.

<text>The East Germany national football team, recognised as Germany DR by FIFA, represented East Germany in men&#x27;s international football, playing as one of three post-war German teams, along with Saarland and West Germany.

East Germany qualified for the World Cup once, doing so in 1974, and after German reunification in 1990, the Deutscher Fußball Verband der DDR (DFV, ), and with it the East German team, joined the &quot;Deutscher Fußball Bund&quot; (DFB) and the West Germany national football team that had just won the World Cup.

==History==
In 1949, before East Germany (GDR) was founded and while regular private clubs were still banned under Soviet occupation, efforts were made to play football anyway. Helmut Schön coached selections of Saxony and the Soviet occupation zone before moving to the West. On 6 February 1951, the GDR applied for FIFA membership, which was protested against by the German Football Association, which was already a full member. FIFA accepted the GDR association (later called DFV) on 6 October 1951 as a provisional member and on 24 July 1952 as a full member.

The first international game, not competitive but rather a display of goodwill, took place on 21 September 1952 against Poland in Warsaw, losing 3–0 in front of a crowd of 35,000. The first home game was on 14 June 1953 against Bulgaria, a 0–0 draw in front of a crowd of 55,000 at Heinz-Steyer-Stadion in Dresden. Only three days later, the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany would have prevented the permitted assembly of that many Germans. On 8 May 1954 games resumed, with a 1–0 loss against Romania. The East Germans had not even considered entering the World Cup which was won by the West Germans two months later. This caused much euphoria not only in the West, and the GDR tried to counter this by abandoning their policy of presenting a group of politically reliable socialist role models of their &quot;new German state&quot;; instead, players were selected purely according to ability. The GDR entered the qualification for the WC 1958 and were hosts to Wales on 19 May 1957 at the Zentralstadion in Leipzig. 500,000 tickets were requested, and officially 100,000 were admitted, but 120,000 in the crowded house witnessed a 2–1 victory.
East Germany qualified for one major tournament in its history, the 1974 World Cup. That tournament was staged in West Germany, and both German teams were drawn in the same group in the first round. With successful games against Chile and Australia, both German teams had qualified early for the second round, with the inter-German game determining first and second in the group. Despite this lack of pressure to succeed, the match on 22 June 1974 in Hamburg was politically and emotionally charged. East Germany beat West Germany 1–0, thanks to a goal by Jürgen Sparwasser. The GDR lost to Brazil and the Netherlands, but secured 3rd place in a final game draw with Argentina. On the other hand, the DFB team changed its line-up after the loss and went on to win all games in the other second round group B, against Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Poland, and the World title against the Netherlands.

East Germany nearly secured qualification for the 1990 World Cup, needing only a draw versus Austria in Vienna in their final group match on 15 November 1989 to achieve a place in Italy. Toni Polster scored three times as Austria won 3–0 and advanced to the finals instead.

The GDR took part in the draw for the qualification for the European Championship 1992 and was drawn in Group 5 together with the FRG, Belgium, Wales, and Luxembourg. On 3 October 1990 Germany was re-unified and with them their football teams. The scheduled matches of the East German team were canceled, except for two matches. The match against Belgium was converted into a friendly match on 12 September 1990, in Brussels. It was the last match played by the East Germany national team and ended with a 2–0 victory for them. The match between East and West Germany remained and was scheduled to be played on 14 November 1990, to celebrate the unification of Germany. Due to riots by East German spectators, it was canceled.

Millions of East Germans had moved to the West before the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961, and some escaped in successful &quot;Republikflucht&quot; attempts also afterward. All East Germans were automatically entitled to receive a West German passport, but players who had caps for the DFV, like Norbert Nachtweih and Jürgen Pahl who fled in October 1976 at a U21 match in Turkey, were ineligible for international competition for the DFB due to FIFA rules.

Shortly after reunification, players who had played for the East German team were allowed by FIFA to be eligible for the now un-rivaled German team of the DFB. A total of eight players were capped for both East Germany and unified Germany, among them Matthias Sammer and Ulf Kirsten.

===Olympic football===

East Germany achieved significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league. In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany. For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected. They went on to win the Bronze for Germany. As GDR, they won Bronze in 1972 in Munich, Gold in 1976, and silver medal in 1980 in Moscow.

==East vs. West==

Over the years of their separate existence, the GDR and FRG played each other only a handful of times. The only meeting with professionals from the West was at the 1974 World Cup, which East Germany won 1–0. Three other games were played in Olympic Football where only players with amateur status could represent West Germany, like a young Uli Hoeneß who delayed his pro career in 1972. In the inter-German qualification prior to the 1964 Olympic Games, the two played a two-legged preliminary round tie, the GDR advancing to represent Germany as they won their home leg 3–0, while the FRG won the return 2–1. In the 1972 Olympic Games, the GDR and FRG, having qualified from their first round groups, met in the second round, with the GDR winning 3–2.
The draw for 1992 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying took place on 2 February 1990, with East Germany drawn in Group 5 along with Belgium, Wales, Luxembourg – and West Germany. By 23 August that year, the East German parliament confirmed reunification for 3 October. The planning for the opening fixture away to Belgium on 12 September was too far along to be canceled, so it was played as a friendly. It was also planned to play East Germany&#x27;s home fixture against West Germany, scheduled for 21 November 1990 in Leipzig, as a friendly to celebrate the unification of the DFB and DFV, but the game was canceled due to rioting in East German stadia.

<doc id="758565" wikidata="Q582732" url="?curid=758565" title="Antiqua (typeface class)">
<text>Antiqua () is a style of typeface used to mimic styles of handwriting or calligraphy common during the 15th and 16th centuries. Letters are designed to flow, and strokes connect together in a continuous fashion; in this way it is often contrasted with Fraktur-style typefaces where the individual strokes are broken apart. The two typefaces were used alongside each other in the Germanophone world, with the Antiqua–Fraktur dispute often dividing along ideological or political lines. After the mid-20th century, Fraktur fell out of favor and Antiqua-based typefaces became the official standard in Germany. (In German, the term &quot;Antiqua&quot; refers to serif typefaces.)

== History ==

Antiqua typefaces are typefaces designed between 1470 and 1600, specifically those by Nicolas Jenson and the Aldine roman commissioned by Aldus Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo. The letterforms were based on a synthesis of Roman inscriptional capitals and Carolingian writing. Florentine poet Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have touched on the handwriting of his time; in two letters he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its protracted strokes (&#x27;) and exuberant (&#x27;) letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (&#x27;), clear (&#x27;) and orthographically correct. 

Boccaccio was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio&#x27;s immediate circle this post-Petrarchan &quot;semi-gothic&quot; revised hand spread to &quot;&quot; in Florence, Lombardy and the Veneto. A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (&quot;illustration&quot;) was Poggio Bracciolini, a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new humanist script in the first decade of the 15th century. 

The Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine calligrapher of &quot;&quot; and had transcribed texts to support himself presumably, as Martin Davies points out before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the papal curia. 

Berthold Ullman identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio&#x27;s transcription of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Epistles to Atticus&quot;. By the time the Medici library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the &quot;&quot;. 

The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli and Coluccio Salutati. The neat, sloping, humanist cursive invented by the Florentine humanist de&#x27; Niccoli in the 1420s and disseminated through his numerous scholars is usually characterized as essentially a rapid version of the same script. Rhiannon Daniels writes, however, that &quot;this was not humanistic bookhand written cursively, but a running script written with a very fine pen; a modification of contemporary gothic chancery script influenced by humanistic bookhand; hence it is sometimes known as &quot;&quot;&quot;.

In the late fifteenth century this &quot;chancery script in the Antique manner&quot; was further developed by humanists in Rome. Calligraphic forms of this &quot;chancery italic&quot; were popularized by the famous Roman writing master Ludovico Arrighi in the early sixteenth century. In the history of Western typography, humanist minuscule gained prominence as a basis for the typesetter&#x27;s roman typeface, as it was standardized by Aldus Manutius, who introduced his revolutionary italic typeface based on the chancery hand in Venice, 1501, and practiced by designer-printers Nicolas Jenson and Francesco Griffo, respectively; this is the reason why they are also known as &quot;Venetian types&quot; and occasionally as &quot;old style&quot;, differentiated from modern styles by the more or less uniform thickness of all strokes and by slanted serifs. 

Roman type has helped establish the remarkable resistance to change of the modern Latin alphabet. The term &quot;Antiqua&quot; later came to sometimes be used for Roman type in general as opposed to blackletter; in German, it used of serif typefaces in particular.

==Designers==
* Berne Nadall (1869–1932), American designer, created Caslon Antique (1896–98)
* Peter Behrens (1868–1940), German architect and graphic designer, created Behrens Antiqua (1907–1909)
* Vojtěch Preissig (1873–1944), Czech designer influential in the areas of book and type design, created Preissig Antiqua (1923–25) specifically for the Czech language
* Paul Renner (1878–1956), created Renner Antiqua (1939). Renner also created the typeface Futura.
* Hermann Zapf (1918–2015), created Zapf Renaissance Antiqua (1984–87). Created many other fonts over the years.

==Modern forms ==

Book Antiqua, a typeface designed by Hermann Zapf, a variant of the Palatino typeface. (In this case, &quot;Antiqua&quot; is another word for the &quot;Roman&quot; style of typefaces that Palatino is based on, as opposed to blackletter.)

Preissig Antiqua: designed by Vojtěch Preissig

Renner Antiqua: designed by Paul Renner, revived by Patrick Strietzel (1939), crafted at D. Stempel AG Foundry.

Zapf Renaissance Antiqua: another Zapf typeface.

==Blackletter and the Antiqua–Fraktur dispute==

Antiqua&#x27;s Germanic opposite is blackletter, in which the letter forms are separated or &quot;fractured&quot;. In 19th- and 20th-century Germany there was a dispute over whether German should be written in Antiqua or the highly developed Fraktur blackletter. In 1911, the German Reichstag rejected an official switch to Antiqua by only three votes: 85 to 82. Hitler expressed a desire to switch to Antiqua as early as 1934; however it took until 1941 for the transition to be made law, when Martin Bormann issued a decree switching to usage of international scripts such as Antiqua.

<doc id="758568" wikidata="Q56485" url="?curid=758568" title="Wymysorys language">
<text>Wymysorys (, ), also known as Vilamovian, Wilamowicean, or Wilmesaurisch, is a West Germanic language spoken by the Vilamovian ethnic minority in the town of Wilamowice, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland ( in Wymysorys), on the border between Silesia and Lesser Poland, near Bielsko-Biała. It is considered an endangered language, possibly the most so of any of the Germanic languages. There are probably fewer than 20 native users of Wymysorys, virtually all bilingual; the majority are elderly.

The status of Wymysorys is complex because, genealogically, it belongs to the East Central dialect group of High German. Nevertheless, based on the self-identification of its users as a group separate from the Germans and the existence of a literary language, it can be considered a separate language.

It belongs to the dialect group of the former , which includes the Alzenau dialect.

== History ==
In origin, Wymysorys is considered to derive from 12th-century Middle High German, with a strong influence from Polish, and presumably also some influence from Low German, Dutch, Old English and perhaps Frisian. The inhabitants of Wilamowice are thought to be descendants of German, Flemish and Scottish settlers who arrived in Poland during the 13th century. Many of the inhabitants claim that they are descended from the people of Flanders, Friesland, and Holland, with others claiming to be descended from the Anglo-Saxons. Although historically derived from the German dialect continuum, Wymysorys is not mutually intelligible with Standard German. Unlike in other West Germanic enclave communities in Polish-speaking territory, where closely related dialects (e.g. Halcnovian) were spoken, Wymysorys speakers did not self-identify as Germans and used Polish, not German, as &quot;Dachsprache&quot;.

Wymysorys was the vernacular language of Wilamowice until World War II. However, it seems it has been in decline since the late 19th century. In 1880 as many as 92% of the town&#x27;s inhabitants spoke Wymysorys (1,525 out of 1,662 people), in 1890 – only 72%, in 1900 – 67%, in 1910 – 73% again. Although Wymysorys was taught in local schools (under the name of &quot;local variety of German&quot;), since 1875 the basic language of instruction in most schools in Austro-Hungarian Galicia was Polish. During World War II and the German occupation of Poland, Wymysorys was openly promoted by the Nazi administration, but after the war the tables turned: local communist authorities forbade the use of Wymysorys in any form. The widespread bilingualism of the people saved most local residents from being forcibly resettled to Germany, but many of them stopped teaching their children their language or even using it in daily life. Although the ban was lifted after 1956, Wymysorys has been gradually replaced by Polish, especially among the younger generation. Most of the inhabitants have the same surnames (Mozler, Rozner, Figwer, Biba, Foks, Sznajder), which led to the use of nicknames (Fliöer-Fliöer, Hȧla-Mockja, i.e. Florian, son of Florian or Maciej, son of Elżbieta).

Nowadays, as part of saving the Wymysorys culture, new songs and lyrics are written in this language. The play was written in Wymysorys, based on the prose of J. R. R. Tolkien, and was staged, among others, at the Polish Theatre in Warsaw in February 2016.

Acting on a proposal by Tymoteusz Król, the Library of Congress added the Wymysorys language to the register of languages on 18 July 2007. It was also registered in the International Organization for Standardization, where it received the &quot;wym&quot; ISO 639-3 code. In a 2009 UNESCO report Wymysorys has been reported as &quot;severely endangered&quot; and nearly extinct.

Members of the Wikimedia Polska association were also involved in saving this dying language. As part of the &quot;Wilamowice&quot; project, Wymysorys words read by Józef Gara were recorded, and the Wymysorys dictionary in Wiktionary was supplemented (in 2018, the dictionary consisted of over 7,000 words).

== Revitalisation ==

Some new revitalisation efforts were started in the first decade of the 21st century, led by speaker Tymoteusz Król, whose efforts include private lessons with a group of pupils as well as compiling language records, standardising written orthography and compiling the first ever dictionary of Wymysorys. Additionally, a new project called The Wymysiöeryśy Akademyj – Accademia Wilamowicziana or WA-AW was established under the &quot;Artes Liberales&quot; program at the University of Warsaw with the intention of creating a unified scholastic body for the study of the Wymysorys language.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
* Voiced stops, sibilant fricatives and affricates are regularly devoiced or voiceless in final position.
* The sounds of and are interchangeable among different speakers. The use of is typically heard at the beginning of a word, possibly due to the influence of Polish, even though historically in Germanic languages, the glottal fricative is typically heard.
* The series of palato-alveolar and alveolo-palatal fricative and affricate sounds, are heard interchangeably among various speakers.
* is heard in word-final position, as an allophone of .
* The voiced affricates are only heard in Polish loanwords.
* A series of flat post-alveolar sibilants and affricates , are also heard in Polish loanwords, interchangeably with alveolar-palatal sounds .
* The labial-velar approximant is pronounced with a lesser degree of lip rounding than in English, and is more similar to the Polish pronunciation of &quot;ł&quot; .

=== Vowels ===
* The close-mid sound is phonetically more fronted as .
* Mid central vowel sounds are also heard close central sounds , among speakers.

== Alphabet ==
Wymysorys has been for centuries mostly a spoken language. It was not until the times of Florian Biesik, the first author of major literary works in the language, that a need for a separate version of a Latin alphabet arose. Biesik wrote most of his works in plain Polish alphabet, which he considered better-suited for the phonetics of his language. In recent times Józef Gara (1929–2013), another author of works in the local language, devised a distinct Wymysorys alphabet, consisting of 34 letters derived from the Latin script and mostly based on Polish as well:
Wymysorys orthography includes the digraph &quot;AO&quot;, which is treated as a separate letter.

== Example words and their relationship to other languages ==

Our Father, thou (who) art in heaven,
Thy name shall be hallowed;
Thy kingdom shall come here;
Thy will shall be in heaven and on earth;
give our daily bread to us today;
and forgive us our debts/sins,
as we, too, forgive our debtors/sinners;
don&#x27;t lead us to sin;
but save us from evil.
[For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.]
Amen.

Bringing nuts and apples,
Sleep, my Johnny, soundly!

<doc id="758569" wikidata="Q1748402" url="?curid=758569" title="Iron Council">
<text>Iron Council (2004) is a weird fantasy novel by the British writer China Miéville, his third set in the Bas-Lag universe, following &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Scar&quot; (2002). In addition to the steampunk influences shared by its predecessors, &quot;Iron Council&quot; draws several elements from the Western genre.

&quot;Iron Council&quot; is one of China Miéville&#x27;s most overtly political novels, being strongly inspired by the anti-globalization movement, and tackling issues such as imperialism, corporatism, terrorism, racial hatred, homosexuality, culture shock, labour rights and war. The novel won the Arthur C. Clarke and Locus Awards in 2005, and was also nominated for the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards the same year.

==Plot==
&quot;Iron Council&quot; follows three major narrative threads that join to form the novel&#x27;s climax. Although Miéville weaves back and forth between narrative, time and space, this summary will follow each narrative individually, discussing their relation to each other toward the end. The novel is set in and around New Crobuzon, a sprawling London-esque city. New Crobuzon has for some unknown time been at war with Tesh, and is attempting to build a railroad across the outlying desert, partially as a new means of conducting this war. Against this backdrop, the novel follows the deeds of three main characters—Ori, Cutter and Judah Low.

Judah&#x27;s story begins some 20 years before the novel&#x27;s opening. Judah was hired as a railroad scout for New Crobuzon, charged with mapping terrain and informing the land&#x27;s inhabitants of the railroad&#x27;s coming. While doing so, he spends time with the Stiltspear, a race of indescribable creatures who can conjure golems, living creatures made from unliving matter. Judah attempts to warn the Stiltspear away, but they will not listen and he must settle for making a few recordings and beginning to learn their golemetric arts. Eventually, he returns to the railroad, which does indeed wipe out the Stiltspear. Shortly afterward, Judah, a prostitute named Ann-Hari, and a Remade named Uzman lead a revolution in which the rail workers drive the overseers away, free the Remade, and hijack the train, transforming it into a moving socialist dwelling.

Iron Council, the perpetual train, moves through the desert, gathering track from behind and laying it in whichever direction its citizens decide. The Council keeps moving to avoid the New Crobuzon militia, who are anxious to reclaim the train and destroy the rebellion-inspiring Council. Judah returns to New Crobuzon, where he immerses himself in esoteric golemetry literature, emerging as a master of the art. Eventually, Judah returns to the Iron Council, having spread its word throughout New Crobuzon, intent on using his golemetry to protect it.

Cutter, whom the reader joins at the novel&#x27;s opening, was a friend, disciple, and lover to Judah during Judah&#x27;s return to New Crobuzon. He leads a group consisting of other disciples of Judah in search of the Iron Council to warn of an impending attack by the New Crobuzon militia. After living and working with the council for a while, Cutter returns with Judah and others to New Crobuzon to inspire revolt with the news of Iron Council, which has decided to return to the city and confront the militia on its own turf. In the Iron Council&#x27;s travels they meet Qurabin, a monk of the Moment of the Hidden and Lost, who continually trades aspects of themselves in return for whatever knowledge they need (having previously traded their gender, and over the course of the novel, their native language, various memories, and finally their eyes to help the protagonists).

Meanwhile, dissatisfied revolutionary Ori is led by a half-crazed old homeless man named Spiral Jacobs to join the militant gang of Toro. Committing robberies, raids, and even murder, Toro&#x27;s group proceeds mercilessly on its quest to assassinate the mayor of New Crobuzon, a plan which is later revealed to be personal rather than political. During Ori&#x27;s struggles with and against his new gang, an uprising by the Collective, a union of revolutionary groups, threatens to finally wrest New Crobuzon from the hands of its corrupt parliament and militia. After several days of fighting, however, the Collective is destroyed. Ori then learns that Spiral Jacobs is actually a powerful sorcerer sent by Tesh to introduce a dark, destructive force into the midst of New Crobuzon. Here Judah, Ori, and Cutter unite to stop Jacobs with the help of Qurabin, who takes the Tesh ambassador with him &#x27;into the domain of Tekke Vogu&#x27;. Ori is killed in the confrontation.

In light of the collapse of the Collective, Judah sends Cutter to dissuade Iron Council from returning. He is unsuccessful, and Judah conjures a time-golem to freeze the train in time to save its citizens. Ann-Hari murders Judah shortly thereafter for thwarting the attack. As the novel ends, Iron Council has become a public monument of sorts, poised on the verge of attacking New Crobuzon until the unknown moment when the time golem dissipates. Cutter re-immerses himself in New Crobuzon&#x27;s underground resistance movements, revitalising the protest publication Runagate Rampant.

==Reception==
Steven Poole reviewed the book for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and suggested that &quot;in comparison with &quot;The Scar&quot;, such ideas are fewer and less indulgently elaborated. &quot;Iron Council&quot; feels more po-faced, more weighed down by its tonnage of political baggage ... Still, fantasy fiction is usually fabulously conservative, and &quot;Iron Council&quot; – with its implicit trade unionism, as well as the fact that many characters are casually bisexual – stands as a rebuke to the genre&#x27;s medieval politics.&quot; Concluding &quot;It was a good ride.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; review by Michael Dirda states that &quot;[i]n myriad ways, China Miéville&#x27;s New Crobuzon is an unweeded garden of unearthly delights, and &quot;Iron Council&quot; a work of both passionate conviction and the highest artistry.&quot;

<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Douglas is one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC).&lt;br&gt; ASPC-Douglas is located in Douglas, Cochise County, Arizona, 248 miles southeast from the state capital of Phoenix, Arizona. 

The ASPC-Douglas, adjacent to the Bisbee-Douglas airport, first opened as the Cochise Correctional Training Facility early in 1984. It now consists of 6 units: Gila, Maricopa, Eggers, Mohave, Papago and the Complex Detention Unit (CDU). Built with inmate assistance to the contractor, the first unit to become operational at ASPC-Douglas, was the Maricopa unit. The next was the Mohave unit. Due to prison overcrowding the Gila unit was built with portable modular housing. In 1984, a law was passed that DUI inmates could not be housed with other inmates. This led to the Papago Unit being purchased from the Desert Inn Motel Company, after which it was converted into a prison unit. A special Detention unit was also added.

ASPC-Douglas has an inmate capacity of approximately 2,148 in 5 housing units at security levels 2, 3 and 5. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest risk or need. ASPC-Douglas is a modern, medium to high security prison.

<doc id="758577" wikidata="Q171528" url="?curid=758577" title="Martin Donnelly (racing driver)">
<text>Hugh Peter Martin Donnelly (born 26 March 1964) is a British racing driver from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He competed in Formula Three and Formula 3000 where he won 3 races. In the 1988 International Formula 3000 season he placed third despite only competing in the final five rounds of the championship. He raced in Formula One in and , until a serious crash during practice at the Jerez circuit ended his Formula One career. After leaving F1, he has been a prominent driving coach and retains an association with Lotus Cars.

==Racing career==

===Formula One===
During , as well as his racing commitments, Donnelly was the test driver for Lotus Formula One team. But it was during that Donnelly got his first race start when he substituted for Arrows driver Derek Warwick at the 1989 French Grand Prix after Warwick injured his back in a non-competitive karting accident. He impressed in France qualifying 14th compared to his much more experienced teammate Eddie Cheever who started 25th on the grid. Donnelly finished his first F1 race 3 laps down in 12th place and was the last car running to finish while Cheever&#x27;s experience told and he had a better race finishing only 1 lap down in 7th place.

In he continued in F1 with Lotus though this time not as a test driver but as a race driver alongside new teammate Derek Warwick. However, it was a frustrating season of scoring no points driving the V12 powered Lotus-Lamborghini which often saw him retire with engine failure. Donnelly&#x27;s performance in the Lotus drew interest from several more competitive teams, prompting Lotus to renegotiate his contract for 5.6 million pounds, to prevent him from being bought out. 

====Jerez accident====

At the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix held at the Jerez circuit, Donnelly suffered a serious crash caused by suspension failure during practice, his Lotus hitting the wall at an estimated speed of . This caused his car to break apart, the safety cell splitting open, which ejected Donnelly from the wreckage. Donnelly was sent across the live track as cars were still racing around the track. He sustained multiple injuries in the crash, including brain and lung contusions as well as severe leg fractures, the latter of which almost necessitated the amputation of his right leg. Sid Watkins and medics rushed to the scene to save Donnelly&#x27;s life as he remained lifeless on the race track, being airlifted to hospital. Prof. Watkins applied his skills upon arrival as it is reported Donnelly had swallowed his tongue on impact and was struggling to breathe. His friend Ayrton Senna watched on in horror and with concern for Donnelly. His condition was critical, being placed in a medically induced coma as his organs started to fail, with his heart stopping twice. The injuries being so severe he was read the last rites by a priest. With extensive physiotherapy, further surgeries to his badly damaged leg, Donnelly was remarkably able to walk again.

In 1993 Donnelly had a brief test with Jordan, but due to the severity of his injuries and doubts due to the horrific nature of his crash, Donnelly&#x27;s Formula One career was over.

===After Formula One===
Donnelly has since raced in smaller club events, and owned a Formula Vauxhall and Formula Three team, Martin Donnelly Racing. In 2004, Donnelly raced a Mazda RX-8 in a Silverstone 24-Hour race, finishing in 27th place. 2006 saw Donnelly return to Lotus, participating in a track day sponsored by a Lotus owner&#x27;s club. In September 2007, Donnelly beat 35 other Lotus Elises to win Class A in the Donington Park round of the Elise Trophy. This class win was closely followed by the race win in the 2nd Elise Trophy race of the day. Later in the season he raced at Spa-Francorchamps and in 2008, campaigned in a Lotus 2-Eleven. Donnelly continues to have a close relationship with Elise Trophy organisers LoTRDC, racing in a Lotus Evora in 2012 and he is currently working as a club steward for Lotus Cup Europe. In 2017 Donnelly raced in the FIA Lotus Cup Europe in a Motul sponsored Lotus Elise.

Donnelly worked as a driver development director for Comtec Racing in 2008. By 2009, Donnelly was no longer associated with Comtec Racing. In June 2010, Donnelly drove as a guest in the Ginetta G50 Cup at Oulton Park. On 2 July 2011 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Donnelly drove a Lotus 102 similar to that which nearly took his life. The Lamborghini-powered car was the same specification as the car he drove in 1990, the original car having been completely destroyed in the crash. He has been appointed as the driver representative on the FIA stewards panel for a number of F1 Grand Prix including most recently the 2012 and 2013 Canadian Grand Prix. 

Having worked as sporting director and driver development manager at Comtec Racing, Donnelly has recently formed the Donnelly track academy specialising in Lotus trackday events and racing services in Norfolk.

Donnelly made his British Touring Car Championship début in 2015, briefly driving for the works Infiniti-Support Our Paras Racing team, but the team&#x27;s plans were thrown into disarray by the marque&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal of its backing from the project, and he was replaced by Max Coates.

In 2019 Donnelly crashed his moped while participating in a charity rally, rebreaking his femur and subsequently suffering from sepsis. As he was unable to work due to his injuries, a successful fundraiser was held, drawing donations from numerous members of the racing community.

<text>Many places which were once in the former British Empire were named after the British monarch who reigned over it for the greater part of its most dominant period, Queen Victoria. As such, Victoria is one of the most commemorated individuals in place-names around the world.

Other places that have the name &quot;Victoria&quot;, without the association with Queen Victoria, tend to be derived from the Spanish language-word for &#x27;victory&#x27;, see Victoria (disambiguation).

<text>The Hammerskins (also known as Hammerskin Nation) are a neo-Nazi group formed in 1988 in Dallas, Texas. Their primary focus is the production and promotion of white power rock music, and many white power bands have been affiliated with the group. The Hammerskins were affiliated with the record label 9% Productions. The Hammerskins host several annual concerts, including Hammerfest, an annual event in both the United States and Europe in honor of deceased Hammerskin Joe Rowan, the lead singer of the band Nordic Thunder.

The Hammerskins were one of the most prominent American white power skinhead groups. The Anti-Defamation League describes them as the United States&#x27; best-organized neo-Nazi skinhead group, with the Hammerskin Nation website boasting six chapters in the United States and chapters existing in Canada, various European countries, New Zealand, and Australia. The organization is self-described as &quot;leaderless&quot;. Individual members have been involved in many violent attacks and hate crimes, mostly in the US (notably the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting), although these have not been organized by the group.

It maintains an active recruitment strategy, and encourages members to enlist in military forces in order to learn combat skills for an upcoming race war. Its website is defunct. It has run Facebook groups under the name Crew 38 (now inactive) and its online forums, and this name is also used for supporters of the group in Australia.

==History==
The Hammerskins emerged in the late 1980s from the Dallas based Confederate Hammerskins. Their name is based on a scene in the 1982 film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot;.

The first international chapters of the group were formed in Northern Ireland and Switzerland in 1990, and Australian and Canadian chapters followed in 1993. During the following year, the regional groups amalgamated, rebranding as Hammerskin Nation, but in 1999 reverted to the regional system under an international umbrella.

Power struggles had split the group into several factions by 2008. The website and online forums went offline in 2001 with little explanation, and not long afterwards, the white supremacist Tom Metzger announced the termination of the group known as Hammerskin Nation. However, another &quot;official&quot; Hammerskin Nation website was launched in 2002, which was still active as of October 2018 but without online forums, but was inactive by April 2020.

==Description==
===Symbolism and motto===
The Hammerskins logo and design, depicting two red and black crossed claw hammers, was taken from a fictitious neo-Nazi organization depicted in the 1982 film &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall.&quot; The two crossed hammer was designed by Gerald Scarfe who made it for Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1979 album The Wall and its movie, it was soon taken, changed and redesigned for the white supremacist group in Dallas. The portrayal of the fictional group in the film was intended to show Nazism negatively and as a parody. Their logo and the motto &quot;Hammerskins forever, forever hammerskins&quot; (&quot;H.F.F.H.&quot;) often appear in their paraphernalia and tattoos. Crew 38 and Hammerskins members also frequently identify themselves with the slogan &quot;838&quot;, meaning &quot;hail [the] crossed hammers&quot; (the initialism H.C.H. translates into the eighth, third and eighth letters of the alphabet).
As of October 12, 2018, their website showed six U.S. chapters: West, Northwest, Midland, Confederate, Northern, and Eastern, and chapters in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Brazil. Each chapter, both in the US and internationally, has a specific design which often includes the original Hammerskins logo and a symbol, logo or flag that represents the state or country.

=== Recruitment ===
The organization is self-described as &quot;leaderless&quot;. It maintains an active recruitment strategy, and encourages members to enlist in military forces in order to learn combat skills for an upcoming race war.

==United States==

Individual members have been involved in many violent attacks and hate crimes, mostly in the US, although these have not been organized by the group.

Many Outlaw Hammerskins members attended the 2002 NordicFest, and the group was planning to provide security for a white pride festival hosted by the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The Outlaw Hammerskins are now defunct.

Many of its members have been convicted of harassment, assault and even murder. On August 5, 2012, Hammerskin Wade Michael Page was shot by police and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after he killed six people in a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Page had become a &quot;fully patched&quot; member of the Hammerskins in autumn 2011, according to the Anti-Defamation League. He played in at least three Hammerskin-affiliated bands; End Apathy, Definite Hate and 13 Knots. According to media sources and civil rights organizations, End Apathy, Wade&#x27;s main band, had played at several recent Hammerskin events in the United States prior to the shooting-spree.

==Southern Cross Hammerskins (Australia)==
The Australian group, founded in 1993, is known as the Southern Cross Hammerskins. In 2014 they were reported to be active in Melbourne, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sydney and Adelaide, with a focus on anti-Asian and anti-Muslim sentiment. They target young men, particularly at heavy metal music festivals, and are aligned with skinheads. A support group called Crew 38 was created in 2009, for those who were unable to commit to full membership.

In October 2019, the Southern Cross Hammerskins along with Blood &amp; Honour Australia held the annual Ian Stuart Donaldson Memorial Concert in Melbourne. Various human rights, faith, trade union and anti-discrimination groups lobbied the Victorian Government to stop the concert, to no avail, and it went ahead as intended.

== Germany ==
The German chapter of the Hammerskins was banned by the German government on 19 September 2023.

<text>Military badges of the United States are awards authorized by the United States Armed Forces that signify rating, qualification, or accomplishment in several career fields, and also serve as identification devices for personnel occupying certain assignments. Personal recognition is granted to service members by a number of awards and decorations. Together with military decorations, such badges are authorized for wear on military uniforms.

Each of the six military services maintains a separate series of badges that may be awarded to service members, although some badges may be shared between branches. An example of the latter is the Basic Parachutist Badge, which is authorized for wear by all six services. Each service determines how badges are displayed, how many may be worn at one time, and whether badges awarded by other branches may be worn on the uniform. Properly earned foreign badges may also be worn, depending on the branch of service, awarding nation, and type of badge.

==General categories==

There are six general categories of United States military badges:
* Identification badges of the uniformed services of the United States
* Badges of the United States Army
* Badges of the United States Marine Corps
* Badges of the United States Navy
* Badges of the United States Air Force
* Badges of the United States Space Force
* Badges of the United States Coast Guard

==U.S Auxiliary military badges==
There are also United States auxiliary military badges:
* Badges of the Civil Air Patrol
* Badges of the Coast Guard Auxiliary

Auxiliary badges are reserved for members of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary or the Civil Air Patrol, as the auxiliary of the United States Air Force. The Coast Guard Auxiliary, originally known as the Coast Guard Reserve, was founded in 1939 by the Congress. It enlisted the aid of &quot;unpaid, volunteer U.S. citizens who owned motorboats or yachts.&quot; Its purpose is to keep safe the seas and waters of the United States, offer general aid to the entirety of the Coast Guard, and ensure the efficiency of the technology used on the seas and waters of the United States. The Civil Air Patrol was involved with United States Civil Defense operations throughout World War II. On 26 May 1948, Public Law 80-557 was enacted and CAP became the official auxiliary to the United States Air Force.

==Obsolete badges==
In addition to those badges currently authorized, there are a number of obsolete badges that have been phased out of the U.S. armed forces and no longer appear on U.S. award precedence charts.

<doc id="758592" wikidata="Q4647476" url="?curid=758592" title="A. A. MacLeod">
<text>Alexander Albert MacLeod (April 2, 1902 – March 13, 1970) was a political organizer and a prominent member of the Communist Party of Canada and, later, of its legal group, the Labor-Progressive Party. He was an elected Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario (1943–51).

==Early life==
MacLeod was born in 1902 in Black Rock, Nova Scotia. After the opening of the steel plant at Sydney Mines, the family relocated and his father was employed there as a steelworker. MacLeod was educated in local public schools and also worked at the steel plant as a young man. He enlisted in the Canadian Army in his early teens; some accounts state that MacLeod was the youngest soldier to enlist in the Canadian Army during World War I. He went overseas with the 185th Battalion of the Cape Breton Highlanders and returned to Canada shortly before the end of the war. After working at the steel plant again and completing further education, MacLeod was employed by YMCA, first in North Sydney and Halifax in Nova Scotia and then as an executive member in Chicago.

==Radicalization==
In the late 1920s, MacLeod moved to New York City, U.S. to work on the staff of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, a prominent socialist-pacifist magazine. While in New York, he married Virginia MacLean, who was originally from North Sydney and educated at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. The couple were both pacifists and supporters of the Socialist Party of America. They moved further to the left as a result of the Scottsboro Boys case, joining the Defense League for the Scottsboro Boys with which the Communist Party USA was heavily involved. The MacLeods were also radicalized by the poverty of the Great Depression and by their opposition to the growing threat of fascism. In 1933, the couple returned to Nova Scotia, possibly with plans of taking up permanent residence there. MacLeod hoped to establish a workers&#x27; school to prepare coal miners and others to work as social activists. While in Nova Scotia, they campaigned in the 1933 provincial election for J.B. McLachlan, the veteran union leader and Communist who was running as a &quot;Workers&#x27; United Front&quot; candidate. The MacLeods joined the Communist Party during this period.

==Anti-fascism and Spanish Civil War==
In 1934, MacLeod focused his attention on organizing the founding conference of the Canadian League Against War and Fascism, which took place in Toronto in October. With more than 500 delegates in attendance from a range of leftist and labour groups, this was a major step in the Communist Party&#x27;s shift to the popular front strategy. MacLeod presided and served as national chairman for the next five years. In its last years, the organization was known as the Canadian League for Peace and Democracy. MacLeod resigned as chairman in August 1939, on the eve of World War II.

Throughout the 1930s, MacLeod helped attract Andre Malraux, Thomas Mann, Harry F. Ward and others as speakers for events organized by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, and his Canadian League Against War and Fascism. His vision was to steer the peace movement towards the view of peace as realizable through radical change and socialist solidarity.

In 1936, MacLeod led the Canadian delegation at the World Peace Congress in Brussels and shortly afterwards he became the first North American to witness the Spanish Civil War. He jointly published a pamphlet summarizing the critical situation in the Spanish Republic, where a socialist government had come to power earlier that year and was facing a fascist rebellion. Subsequently, MacLeod helped to organize the Canadian Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, which raised support for the defence of the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. He was active in recruiting volunteers for the International Brigade and successfully argued for the creation of a separate Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion in order to recognize the Canadian participation. In 1937 under Norman Bethune&#x27;s direction MacLeod officially presented the Canadian Blood Transfusion Unit to Republicans.

In Prague during the Munich Agreement of 1938, MacLeod &quot;became instrumental in the emigration of Czech intellectuals&quot;.

==World War II==
As a result of the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the eruption of World War II, the League was banned in 1940 under the Defence of Canada Regulations along with the Communist Party itself. Earlier in the year, in January 1940, MacLeod had co-founded and become the first editor of the &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;. The weekly newspaper served as the unofficial organ of the Communist Party as it struggled to remain politically relevant.

In 1941, with the support of the recently elected Saskatchewan Member of Parliament Dorise Nielsen, MacLeod was candidate in the Edmonton East federal by-election as a &quot;People&#x27;s Movement&quot; candidate. He received more than 18 per cent of the vote.

Following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, MacLeod actively promoted the war effort, speaking for the Victory Loan Committee and at major public rallies in support of wartime mobilization.

After the Second World War, MacLeod helped James Gareth Endicott found the Canadian Peace Congress.

==Provincial politics and death==
In the August 1943 Ontario provincial election, MacLeod ran as a Labour candidate and was elected as the Member of Provincial Parliament for the working-class Toronto riding of Bellwoods. His colleague, J.B. Salsberg, a popular union organizer, was elected in the neighbouring riding of St. Andrew. The Labor-Progressive Party was officially formed later that month and became the legal face of the Communist Party. MacLeod and Salsberg were among the most prominent public figures in the LPP and were re-elected in both the 1945 general election and the 1948 general election. MacLeod lost his seat in the 1951 election, and Salsberg remained as the sole LPP MPP until his defeat in 1955. Within the provincial legislative assembly, writes Salsberg&#x27;s biographer Gerald Tulchinsky, the LPP members &quot;exploited their leverage, however limited, to greatest advantage, focusing on labour and human rights issues&quot;. He notes that over the years their interventions contributed to the enactment of legislation in this area. Although his political views were often considered unpopular, MacLeod won the respect of his fellow legislators. Referring to MacLeod and Salsberg, Progressive Conservative Premier Leslie Frost once remarked: &quot;Those two had more brains between them than the rest of the opposition put together&quot;.

After leaving the legislature, in 1954 MacLeod ran for Mayor of Toronto in the municipal election. He came in fourth, with 4,932 votes, losing to Nathan Phillips. MacLeod left the Labor-Progressive Party along with the majority of its members following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech at the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956 that revealed the crimes of Joseph Stalin.

Despite their ideological differences, MacLeod was a personal favourite of Premier Frost, who gave MacLeod an office on the fourth floor of the legislative building at Queen&#x27;s Park following his defeat and made him a paid advisor and one of his speechwriters. MacLeod was involved in the establishment of the Ontario Human Rights Commission in 1961 and edited several of its publications. In another initiative, he proposed the naming of Highway 401, a major new cross-province expressway, as the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway after Sir John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. MacLeod acted as an advisor to Premier John Robarts and worked closely with Clare Westcott and then-Education Minister Bill Davis on several projects concerning Canadian history.

He died on March 13, 1970, of injuries from being struck by a car.

==Family==
MacLeod had two children by Annie Jean Hicks - the first was Jean Macleod and the second was Annabelle MacGregor MacLeod - his wife Annie burned to death when a wood stove blew up only three years later- Annie&#x27;s poor father Rufus &quot;the Red&quot; Lawson Hicks was there to witness the terrible tragedy and beat out the flames and carried the scars of her death on his arms to his grave.

MacLeod later married Virginia MacLean, the sister of Kathlyn Corinne MacLean whose children are Hollywood movie actors Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine. MacLeod thus became their uncle. Both Beatty and MacLaine have referred to the MacLeods as a major influence on their own liberal political philosophy. One of Beatty&#x27;s biographers has commented that his aunt and uncle were &quot;the private inspiration&quot; behind his portrait of Louise Bryant and John Reed in his 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;&quot;.&quot;

MacLeod&#x27;s youngest child, David Leigh MacLeod, worked for Beatty for many years as an assistant. He was associate producer of &quot;Reds&quot; and &quot;Ishtar&quot; as well as co-producer of &quot;The Pick-up Artist&quot;. He was found dead in Montreal, Quebec in 1998. He had been a fugitive from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and New York police for nine years after fleeing a New York courtroom while on trial on charges of criminal solicitation involving minors.

One of MacLeod&#x27;s daughters, Joan MacLeod was a folk singer and married Ray Woodley of the band The Travellers.

<doc id="758593" wikidata="Q748869" url="?curid=758593" title="George Mason Memorial">
<text>The George Mason Memorial is a memorial to Founding Father George Mason, the author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights that inspired the United States Bill of Rights. The Memorial is located in West Potomac Park within Washington, D.C. at 24 E Basin Drive SW, which is a part of the Tidal Basin. Authorized in 1990, with a groundbreaking in 2000 and dedication in 2002, the memorial includes a sculpture of Mason, a pool, trellis, circular hedges, and numerous inscriptions. It was the first memorial in the Tidal Basin area to be dedicated to someone who was not a former President of the United States.

==Namesake==
The memorial commemorates the contributions of Mason, a Founding Father who wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, served as a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and created much of the language, inspiration, and groundwork for what became the United States Bill of Rights. Mason, an Anti-Federalist, did not sign the United States Constitution because it did not abolish the slave trade and because he did not think it had necessary protection for the individual from the federal government. He was sometimes known as the &quot;reluctant statesman&quot;, which was also the title of a 1980 biography written about him by Robert A. Rutland.

==History==
The memorial was authorized by Public Law 101-358 on August 10, 1990, to be developed by the board of regents of Gunston Hall, a museum at Mason&#x27;s historic home in Mason Neck, Virginia. The memorial&#x27;s landscape architect was Faye B. Harwell and the sculptor was Wendy M. Ross. The groundbreaking was October 18, 2000, and the completed memorial was dedicated on April 9, 2002.

The memorial was placed within an existing historic garden, at the site of the last remaining &quot;national garden&quot; of the four that had been established in Washington by the McMillan Plan of 1902. In 1929, the garden was redesigned as &quot;the Pansy Garden&quot;. The designers of the George Mason Memorial researched and restored the original circular garden layout, and plantings drew from that heritage, as well as from Mason&#x27;s own favored plants and those used at Gunston Hall.

The George Mason Memorial is currently administered as part of the National Park Service and is within the jurisdiction of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. The George Mason Memorial is one of three sites in the National Mall area where weddings are permitted; the nearby Jefferson Memorial and the District of Columbia War Memorial are the others.
The memorial is one of many outdoor public art installations within Ward 2 of the District. It is located near the intersection of Ohio Drive and East Basin Drive, The site is within the southwest quadrant of the District of Columbia, within West Potomac Park. It is located near the five 14th Street bridges across the Potomac River, one of which is also named for Mason.

==Sculpture==
The design features a long stone wall with a one-third larger than life-sized statue of a sitting Mason, his legs crossed, and a circular pool with a fountain. Mason leans back on his left hand to ponder something from Cicero&#x27;s 44 BC treatise &quot;De Officiis&quot;, which he holds closed on his right index finger. Two other volumes, John Locke&#x27;s 1706 posthumously published &quot;Of the Conduct of the Understanding&quot; and Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Du Contract Social&quot; (1762), sit on the bench to Mason&#x27;s left. Mason&#x27;s walking stick leans on his hat which sits on the bench to his right.

==Inscriptions==

The circular hedges and pool are supported by a trellis that curves around the back of the memorial. Underneath the trellis are three walls with inscriptions that are high, which include the following quotes:

&quot;This was George Mason, a man of the first order of wisdom among those who acted on the theatre of the revolution, of expansive mind, profound judgment, cogent in argument... Thomas Jefferson, 1821&quot;

&quot;Regarding slavery... that slow poison, which is daily contaminating the minds and morals of our people. Every gentlemen here is born a petty tyrant. Practiced in acts of despotism and cruelty, we become callous to the dictates of humanity, and all the finer feelings of the soul. Taught to regard a part of our own species in the most abject and contemptible degree below us, we lose that idea of the dignity of man, which the hand of nature had implanted in us, for great and useful purposes... George Mason, July 1773&quot;

&quot;I recommend it to my sons... never to let the motives of private interest or ambition to induce them to betray, nor the terrors of poverty and disgrace or the fear of danger or of death deter them from asserting the liberty of their country, and endeavoring to transmit to their posterity those sacred rights to which themselves were born. George Mason, March 1773&quot;

&quot;All men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent natural rights... among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. George Mason, May 1776&quot;

&quot;The first declaration of rights which truly deserves the name is that of Virginia... and its author is entitled to the eternal gratitude of mankind. Marquis de Condorcet, Paris 1789&quot;

<text>Kansas City Municipal Stadium was an American baseball and football stadium in the central United States, located in Kansas City, Missouri. It was located at the corner of Brooklyn Avenue and E. 22nd Street.

Municipal Stadium hosted both the minor-league Kansas City Blues of the American Association and the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues from 1923 to 1955.

The stadium was almost completely rebuilt prior to the 1955 baseball season when the Kansas City Athletics moved to Kansas City from Philadelphia. The Athletics played from 1955 to 1967, the Kansas City Royals from 1969 to 1972, the Kansas City Chiefs (American Football League and National Football League) from 1963 to 1971 and the Kansas City Spurs (North American Soccer League) from 1968 to 1969.

The stadium hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1960 (first game). In the final football game played there, Municipal Stadium was the site of the longest NFL game in history, a playoff game between the Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins on Christmas Day 1971; the Chiefs moved to the new Arrowhead Stadium in 1972. Jackie Robinson played at the stadium for the Kansas City Monarchs in 1945 until he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers.

==Early stadium history==
The stadium opened in 1923 as Muehlebach Field. It was named for George E. Muehlebach (), who owned the Blues and a number of other Kansas City businesses, including Muehlebach Beer and the Muehlebach Hotel. It was built for the minor-league Blues for $400,000. It served as a replacement for the Blues&#x27; previous home, Association Park.

Located in the inner-city neighborhood near 18th and Vine, the stadium first housed the minor-league white Kansas City Blues baseball team and the Negro league Kansas City Monarchs. The first Negro World Series game was held at the stadium in 1924. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, founded in 1990, is a few blocks from the site.

The stadium consisted of a single-decked, mostly covered, grandstand, extending from the right-field foul pole down and around most of the left-field line. When the New York Yankees bought the Blues as its top farm team in 1937, the stadium was renamed Ruppert Stadium in honor of the Yankees&#x27; owner, Col. Jacob Ruppert. Ruppert died two years later and the stadium was renamed Blues Stadium in 1943.

==Rebuilding for Major League Baseball – 1955==

Arnold Johnson, a Chicago real estate magnate, bought both Blues Stadium and Yankee Stadium in 1953. Johnson then bought the Philadelphia Athletics from Connie Mack in November 1954, announcing plans to move the A&#x27;s from Philadelphia to Kansas City. Johnson then sold Blues Stadium to the city, who renamed it Municipal Stadium and leased it back to the A&#x27;s.

Muehlebach had anticipated that Kansas City would eventually get a major league team. Accordingly, he designed the stadium with footings that were theoretically strong enough to support a future upper deck. However, when work began on double-decking the stadium for the A&#x27;s, it was discovered that three decades of harsh Midwestern winters had weakened the footings until they could no longer support the weight of an upper deck. City officials elected to completely demolish the stadium and rebuild it from scratch. The city ran three shifts and the new stadium was built in 90 days, faithful to the original design, completed in time for the 1955 season opener. The new construction was financed by a bond issuance. The expanded stadium was supposed to seat 38,000, but cost overruns as a result of overtime payments forced officials to reduce capacity to just over 30,000. The Braves Field scoreboard in Boston was purchased for $100,000 and moved from Boston to Kansas City, while temporary bleachers were added in the left field corner and parts of the outfield.

On opening day 1955, former President Harry S Truman, a resident of nearby Independence, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Connie Mack and legendary A&#x27;s player Jimmie Foxx were also in attendance. The A&#x27;s defeated the Detroit Tigers, 8–2.

The baseball field was aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

==Pre-1955 teams==

===Kansas City Monarchs===
From 1923 to 1955, the stadium was also home to the Negro leagues&#x27; longest-running team, the Kansas City Monarchs. The Monarchs won 11 league championships before integration (1923–25, 1929, 1931 in the NNL; 1937–40, 1942, 1946 in the NAL). They appeared in four Negro World Series. They won the first Series in 1924 and lost the second in 1925. They won the 1942 Negro World Series, and lost the 1946 Series.

Many noteworthy players played for the Monarchs at Muelbach Field. The legendary Buck O&#x27;Neil played 10 seasons for the Monarchs.

Hall of Famers Bullet Rogan, J. L. Wilkinson, José Méndez, Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, and Willard Brown all played for the Monarchs. Other Hall of Famers who spent a season or more with the Monarchs include: Cristóbal Torriente, Andy Cooper, Turkey Stearnes, Cool Papa Bell, Bill Foster, Willie Wells, Ernie Banks, and the legendary Jackie Robinson.

===Jackie Robinson===

After being discharged from the United States Army, Jackie Robinson signed with the Monarchs for the 1945 season. He played shortstop and was selected to play in the East-West All-Star game. While playing for the Monarchs, Robinson was scouted by the Dodgers&#x27; Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson on October 23, 1945. Robinson broke the color barrier in the Major Leagues on April 15, 1947.

===Kansas City Blues – Minor League===
The Kansas City Blues were one of the eight founding members of the American Association. The franchise existed in its entirety from 1888 to 1954, and was an original tenant of Municipal Stadium. The franchise was a top-level farm team for the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees. The franchise was an AA team (1923–1945) and then an AAA team (1946–54). The city&#x27;s longtime support of the Blues played a major role in helping it land a Major League Baseball team.

As one of the Yankees&#x27; top farm teams (sharing that status with the Newark Bears for much of the time) the Blues had many great players and successes. The 1939 Blues have been called one of the greatest minor league teams of all time. That team was led by Hall of Fame player (and future Yankee Announcer) Phil Rizzuto and Vince Dimaggio, who hit 46 home runs.

A young Mickey Mantle hit .361 with 11 HR for the Blues in 1951.

Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Ralph Houk, Al Rosen, Billy Martin, Bill Virdon, Johnny Mize and Elston Howard were some of the players in the Yankees farm era who played for the Blues. There were about 580 Blues players who went on to the Major Leagues.

==Major League Baseball==

===Kansas City Athletics===

The stadium was home to many of the shenanigans of Charlie Finley, who bought the A&#x27;s after Arnold Johnson&#x27;s death in 1960. Most notably, he tried to shorten the rather distant fences in April 1964 by creating a &quot;Pennant Porch&quot; in right field, fronting a tiny bleacher section, to mock the famed short fence in right field at Yankee Stadium, home of the powerful Yankees. The move was quickly vetoed by the league, so Finley rebuilt the fence to the bare legal minimum of , and repainted the fence to say &quot;One-Half Pennant Porch&quot;. Later he tried the ruse of putting a canopy over the little bleacher, which just happened to have an extension that reached out over the field. The league, not amused by Finley&#x27;s sense of humor, again ordered him to cease and desist. According to legend, on a road trip that the A&#x27;s made to New York, a Yankee hitter lofted a long fly ball to left field which, in the cavernous left field of Yankee Stadium, became a routine out. Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard is alleged to have then said over the microphone, &quot;In Kansas City, that would have been a home run&quot;, itself a response to Finley&#x27;s dictum for Municipal Stadium public address announcer Jack Layton to announce, &quot;That would have been a home run at Yankee Stadium&quot; for any ball hit beyond a line Finley painted in the outfield grass 296 feet away from home plate in Kansas City. Supposedly, Layton&#x27;s gimmick was short-lived after Finley noticed the vast majority of the &quot;would&#x27;ve been home runs&quot; were being hit by the Athletics&#x27; opponents.
In addition to his notorious tinkering with the right-field corner, Finley experimented with moving the other fences in and out several times during his seven seasons operating the team here. None of those moves had any notable effect on the team&#x27;s performance, as the club finished in or near last place nearly every year.

A small zoo with goats and sheep and picnic area stood behind the right-field fence. When home runs were hit into the field the goats and sheep would scamper up the hill. At the same time, Finley replaced the Athletics&#x27; old elephant mascot with a live mule, appropriately named &quot;Charlie-O&quot;.

At home plate a mechanical rabbit, nicknamed &quot;Harvey&quot; in reference to the stage play &quot;Harvey&quot; (1944) and the subsequent film of the same name (1950), rose out of the ground with new baseballs for the umpire and a compressed-air device (nicknamed &quot;Little Blowhard&quot;) blew dirt off of home plate.

Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Catfish Hunter, Joe Rudi and Gene Tenace were some young A&#x27;s players who debuted in Kansas City and went on to lead them in their World Series victories in Oakland. Hunter and Jackson would earn Hall of Fame induction.

===Kansas City Royals===

Municipal Stadium&#x27;s fate was sealed when, as part of the AFL–NFL merger, all teams were required to have a minimum stadium capacity of 50,000 people; at its height, Municipal Stadium only seated 35,000 people for football and could not be expanded. However, a replacement would have been needed even without the merger, given its age and condition. Public bonds were issued in 1967 to fund a complex including separate football and baseball stadiums—what would eventually become the Truman Sports Complex. It came too late for the A&#x27;s, however, as Finley moved the franchise to Oakland after the 1967 season. Subsequently, Kansas City was awarded an American League expansion team for 1969, and the new Kansas City Royals used the stadium as a temporary home from 1969 to 1972.

Kansas City welcomed the new Royals, who were led by 1969 American League Rookie of the Year Lou Piniella. The expansion team drew nearly one million fans in their first season, despite a 69–93 record.

In subsequent seasons, many future stars made their debuts for the Royals, who were building a highly competitive team, rising up to an 85–76 record in 1971. CF Amos Otis (1970), P Paul Splittorff (1970), SS Freddie Patek (1971), 1B John Mayberry (1972) and P Steve Busby (1972) were a core of young Royals who made their debuts at Municipal Stadium. Each went on to selection into the Royals Hall of Fame.

After the 1972 baseball season, the Royals moved to Kauffman Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex. The Royals won the final game (and event) at Municipal Stadium, a 4–0 win over the Texas Rangers on October 4, 1972, in what was also the final Major League game managed by Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Amos Otis scored the final run in Municipal Stadium history and Ed Kirkpatrick had the final hit. Four days prior Gene Tenace of the Oakland A&#x27;s hit the final home run, and John Mayberry hit the final Royals home run the night before.

==American Football League/National Football League==

===Kansas City Chiefs===

Franchise owner Lamar Hunt moved the Dallas Texans of the fledgling American Football League (AFL) to Kansas City after the 1962 season, becoming the Kansas City Chiefs. The stadium was retrofitted for football. The playing field ran an unconventional east–west, along the first base line. Temporary stands were erected in left field to expand the stadium&#x27;s capacity each fall, but had to be removed during the baseball season. Due to the lower capacity without the temporary bleachers, the Chiefs opened almost every season between 1963 and 1971 with three or more consecutive road games, except 1968, the year in between the Athletics&#x27; final season in Kansas City and the Royals&#x27; first season.

The double-decked grandstand extended all the way across the south sideline, but ended halfway around the west end zone (third base line). Both teams&#x27; benches were on the north sideline in front of the temporary bleachers, as was the case at Wrigley Field, Tiger Stadium, Milwaukee County Stadium and Metropolitan Stadium. The east end zone ended at the right field fence, and the large scoreboard was in this end of the stadium. Due to the fence, there was significantly less room between the end line and the fence of the east end zone than there was in the west end zone, where there was a significant amount of room between the end line and the grandstand.

The Chiefs were in their tenure at Municipal Stadium and had a roster of Hall of Fame players: Quarterback Len Dawson, Defensive End Buck Buchanan, defensive tackle Curley Culp, Linebackers Bobby Bell and Willie Lanier, defensive backs Emmitt Thomas and Johnny Robinson, and Kicker Jan Stenerud. Lamar Hunt himself was the first Chief elected to the Hall, as his role as a league pioneer resulted in pro football growing from 12 to 26 franchises in the 1960s. In one of the great performances at the stadium, the Chiefs&#x27; Hall of Fame Quarterback Len Dawson passed for 435 yards and 6 Touchdowns against the Denver Broncos on November 1, 1964.

While at Municipal Stadium, the Chiefs were successful, representing the American Football League in two of the four Super Bowls before the leagues merged. As AFL Champions under Coach Hank Stram, the Chiefs won Super Bowl IV, beating the Minnesota Vikings 23–7. Previously, the Chiefs played in the very first, Super Bowl I, losing to the Green Bay Packers of Vince Lombardi. Leading up to the game after Lamar Hunt had first used the term &quot;Super Bowl&quot; in the local media as a term for the AFL–NFL Championship Game, a phrase that was later adopted as the name. Super Bowl IV was the last game played before the merger of the AFL and NFL They moved to Arrowhead Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex for the 1972 season.

===Longest NFL game played===
The Chiefs&#x27; final game at Municipal Stadium was played on Christmas Day 1971 and was historic. Despite a brilliant game by the Chiefs&#x27; Ed Podolak, who had 350 total yards from scrimmage, an NFL playoff record that still stands, the Chiefs were beaten by the Dolphins 27–24, when Garo Yepremian kicked a walk-off field goal with 7:20 left in double overtime. The double-overtime playoff contest lasted 82 minutes and 40 seconds (with overtime lasting over 22 minutes) and remains the longest game in NFL history, as well the only post-season football game played at Municipal Stadium.

==North American Soccer League==

===Kansas City Spurs===

The Chicago Spurs of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) relocated the franchise to Kansas City after the NPSL and the United Soccer Association formed the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1967. The Spurs, under Coach Janos Bedl, led the league in attendance, with an average of 8,510 fans. Because of scheduling conflicts with Royals baseball and Chiefs football, the Spurs relocated home matches to the football stadium at Pembroke High School for the 1970 season before the club folded altogether. The Spurs&#x27; colors were red and white and their mascot was &quot;Cowboy Joe&quot;.

===1960 Major League Baseball All Star Game===
On July 11, 1960, Municipal Stadium hosted the best major league players in front of 30,619 fans. During the years when two major league All-Star Games were scheduled each year instead of one, Municipal Stadium hosted the first of the two 1960 games, with the National League winning the contest 5–3. Team rosters included over 15 future Hall of Fame members.

Notable players on the rosters included: Hank Aaron, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente (His first All-Star Game), Stan Musial, Yogi Berra, Roger Maris, Whitey Ford, Brooks Robinson, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Bill Mazeroski, Al Kaline, Orlando Cepeda, Nellie Fox and Luis Aparicio.

Ernie Banks, Del Crandall and Al Kaline hit home runs in the contest.

===1964 Beatles concert===
On September 17, 1964, The Beatles played the stadium as part of their first U.S. tour. The date was originally supposed to be an off-day for the band following a concert in New Orleans, but they agreed to perform when Finley offered their manager, Brian Epstein, a then-record sum of $150,000 (equivalent to $1.14 million in 2014). The group opened the Thursday night concert by saluting the host town with their medley of &quot;Kansas City&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot;; a month later, they would record the medley for their fourth studio album, &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot;.

==Demolition and the site today==
The stadium was demolished in 1976, and replaced by a municipal garden. Today, the former ballpark site is being redeveloped with new single family homes.
 A plaque at 22nd and Brooklyn Street marks the former stadium&#x27;s location. The neighborhood still contains legendary Arthur Bryant&#x27;s Barbecue at 18th and Brooklyn Street, founded in 1908, a fan and player favorite when Municipal Stadium was nearby.
With involvement from former Monarch Buck O&#x27;Neil, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded in 1990 and opened in 1997. Located in the 18th and Vine District, the museum is housed in the former Paseo YMCA building where the Negro leagues were first formed in 1920. The museum is alongside the American Jazz Museum. The site is within a mile of the location of Municipal Stadium.

<doc id="758604" wikidata="Q3431241" url="?curid=758604" title="Electron-beam welding">
<text>Electron-beam welding (EBW) is a fusion welding process in which a beam of high-velocity electrons is applied to two materials to be joined. The workpieces melt and flow together as the kinetic energy of the electrons is transformed into heat upon impact. EBW is often performed under vacuum conditions to prevent dissipation of the electron beam.

== History ==
Electron-beam welding was developed by the German physicist in 1949, who was at the time working on various electron-beam applications. Steigerwald conceived and developed the first practical electron-beam welding machine, which began operation in 1958. American inventor James T. Russell was also credited with designing and building the first electron-beam welder.

==Physics==

Electrons are elementary particles possessing a mass &quot;m&quot; = 9.1 · 10−31 kg and a negative electrical charge &quot;e&quot; = 1.6 · 10−19 C. They exist either bound to an atomic nucleus, as conduction electrons in the atomic lattice of metals, or as free electrons in vacuum.

Free electrons in vacuum can be accelerated, with their paths controlled by electric and magnetic fields. In this way beams of electrons carrying high kinetic energy can be formed. Upon collision with atoms in solids their kinetic energy transforms into heat. EBW provides excellent welding conditions because it involves:

*Strong electric fields, which can accelerate electrons to high speed that carry high power, equal to the product of beam current and accelerating voltage. By increasing the beam current and the accelerating voltage, the beam power can be increased to practically any desired value.
*Magnetic lenses can shape the beam into a narrow cone and focus to a small diameter. This allows for a high power density on the surface to be welded. Values of power density in the crossover (focus) of the beam can be as high as 104–106 W/mm2.
*Penetration depths can be on the order of hundredths of a millimeter. This provides a high volumetric power density, which can reach values of the order 105–107 W/mm3. The temperature in this volume can increase rapidly, up to 108–1010 K/s.

Beam effectiveness depends on many factors. The most important are the physical properties of the materials to be welded, especially the ease with which they can be melted or vaporize under low-pressure conditions. EBW can be so intense that material can boil way, which must be taken into account. At lower values of surface power density (in the range of about 103 W/mm2) the loss of material by evaporation is negligible for most metals, which is favorable for welding. At higher power, the material affected by the beam can quickly evaporate; switching from welding to machining.

===Beam formation===

==== Cathode ====

Conduction electrons (those not bound to the nucleus of atoms) move in a crystal lattice of metals with velocities distributed according to Gauss&#x27;s law and depending on temperature. They cannot leave the metal unless their kinetic energy (in eV) is higher than the potential barrier at the metal surface. The number of electrons fulfilling this condition increases exponentially with increasing metal temperature, following Richardson&#x27;s rule.

As a source of electrons for electron-beam welders, the material must fulfill certain requirements:
*To achieve high power density, the emission current density [A/mm2], hence the working temperature, should be as high as possible,
*To keep evaporation in vacuum low, the material must have a low enough vapour pressure at the working temperature.
*The emitter must be mechanically stable, not chemically sensitive to gases present in the vacuum atmosphere (like oxygen and water vapour), easily available, etc.

These and other conditions limit the choice of material for the emitter to metals with high melting points, practically to only tantalum and tungsten. Tungsten cathodes allow emission current densities about 100 mA/mm2, but only a small portion of the emitted electrons takes part in beam formation, depending on the electric field produced by the anode and control electrode voltages. The most frequently used cathode is made of a tungsten strip, about 0.05 mm thick, shaped as shown in Figure 1a. The appropriate width of the strip depends on the highest required value of emission current. For the lower range of beam power, up to about 2 kW, the width w=0.5 mm is appropriate.

==== Acceleration ====

Electrons emitted from the cathode are low energy, only a few eV. To give them the required speed, they are accelerated by an electric field applied between the emitter and the anode. The accelerating field must also direct the electrons to form a narrow converging “bundle” around an axis. This can be achieved by an electric field in the proximity of the cathode which has a radial addition and an axial component, forcing the electrons in the direction of the axis. Due to this effect, the electron beam converges to some diameter in a plane close to the anode.

For practical applications the power of the electron beam must be controllable. This can be accomplished by another electric field produced by another cathode negatively charged with respect to the first.

At least this part of electron gun must be evacuated to high vacuum, to prevent &quot;burning&quot; the cathode and the emergence of electrical discharges.

====Focusing====
After leaving the anode, the divergent electron beam does not have a power density sufficient for welding metals and has to be focused. This can be accomplished by a magnetic field produced by electric current in a cylindrical coil.
The focusing effect of a rotationally symmetrical magnetic field on the trajectory of electrons is the result of the complicated influence of a magnetic field on a moving electron. This effect is a force proportional to the induction &quot;B&quot; of the field and electron velocity &quot;v&quot;. The vector product of the radial component of induction &quot;Br&quot; and axial component of velocity &quot;va&quot; is a force perpendicular to those vectors, causing the electron to move around the axis. An additional effect of this motion in the same magnetic field is another force &quot;F&quot; oriented radially to the axis, which is responsible for the focusing effect of the magnetic lens. The resulting trajectory of electrons in the magnetic lens is a curve similar to a helix. In this context variations of focal length (exciting current) cause a slight rotation of the beam cross-section.

====Beam deflection system====

The beam spot must be precisely positioned with respect to the joint to be welded. This is commonly accomplished mechanically by moving the workpiece with respect to the electron gun, but sometimes it is preferable to deflect the beam instead. A system of four coils positioned symmetrically around the gun axis behind the focusing lens, producing a magnetic field perpendicular to the gun axis, is typically used for this purpose.

===Penetration ===
====Electron penetration====

When electrons from the beam impact the surface of a solid, some of them are reflected (backscattered), while others penetrate the surface, where they collide with the solid. In non-elastic collisions they lose their kinetic energy. Electrons can &quot;travel&quot; only a small distance below the surface before they transform their kinetic energy into heat. This distance is proportional to their initial energy and inversely proportional to the density of the solid. Under typical conditions the &quot;travel distance&quot; is on the order of hundredths of a millimeter.

====Beam penetration====
By increasing the number of electrons (the beam current) the power of the beam can be increased to any desired value. By focusing the beam onto a small diameter, planar power density values as high as 104 up to 107 W/mm2 can be reached. Because electrons transfer their energy into heat in a thin layer of the solid, the power density in this volume can be high. The volume density can reach values of the order 105–107 W/mm3. Consequently, the temperature in this volume increases rapidly, by 108–109 K/s.

===Results ===

The results of the beam application depend on several factors:

# Beam powerThe power of the beam [W] is the product of the accelerating voltage [kV] and beam current [mA], which are easily measured and must be precisely controlled. The power is controlled by the beam current at constant voltage, usually the highest accessible.
# Power density (beam focusing)The power density at the spot of incidence depends on factors like the size of the cathode electron source, the optical quality of the accelerating electric lens and the focusing magnetic lens, alignment of the beam, the value of the accelerating voltage, and the focal length. All these factors (except the focal length) are a function of the design.
# Welding speedThe welding equipment enables adjustment of the relative speed of motion of the workpiece with respect to the beam in wide enough limits, e.g., between 2 and 50 mm/s.
# Material propertiesDepending on conditions, the extent of evaporation may vary, from negligible to complete. At values of surface power density of around 103 W/mm2 the loss of material by evaporation is negligible for most metals, which is favorable for welding.
# Geometry (shape and dimensions) of the joint

The final effect depends on the particular combination of these parameters.
*Action of the beam at low power density or over a short interval results in melting a thin surface layer.
*A defocused beam does not penetrate, and the material at low welding speeds is heated only by conduction of the heat from the surface, producing a hemispherical melted zone.
*High power density and low speed produces a deeper and slightly conical melt zone.
*A high power density, focused beam penetrates deeper in proportion to total power.

==Welding process==
===Weldability===
For welding thin-walled parts, appropriate welding aids are generally needed. Their construction must provide perfect contact of the parts and prevent movement during welding. Usually they have to be designed individually for a given workpiece.

Not all materials can be welded by an electron beam in a vacuum. This technology cannot be applied to materials with high vapour pressure at the melting temperature, which affects zinc, cadmium, magnesium, and practically all non-metals.

Another limitation may be the change of material properties induced by the welding process, such as a high speed of cooling.

===Joining dissimilar materials===
Some metal components cannot be welded, i.e. to melt part of both in the vicinity of the joint, if the materials have different properties. It is still possible to realize joints meeting high demands for mechanical compactness and that are perfectly vacuum-tight. The principal approach is to melt the one with the lower melting point, while the other remains solid. The advantage of electron-beam welding is its ability to localize heating to a precise point and to control exactly the energy needed for the process. Higher-vacuum substantially contributes to a positive result. A general rule for construction of joints made this way is that the part with the lower melting point should be directly accessible by the beam.

=== Local vacuum ===
Local vacuum systems allow workpieces to be welded without requiring the workpiece to be enclosed within the work chamber. Instead, a vacuum is established by sealing the chamber to one section of the workpiece, welding that section, and moving the chamber or the workpiece (continuously or in discrete steps) to additional sections and repeating the process until the weld is complete. Using arc welding on pressure vessels requires or more separate welds/cycles with additional processing for each cycle. Materials up to thick can be welded in a single pass. Shrinkage is minimal (heat treatment is advisable). Welds avoid oxide or nitride contamination. The material retains strength better. The weld has fewer flaws/voids, less NDE required and it&#x27;s been around for decades.

===Challenges===

If the material melted by the beam shrinks during cooling after solidification, cracking, deformation and changes of shape may occur.

The butt weld of two plates may result in bending of the weldment because more material has been melted at the head than at the root of the weld, although this effect is not as substantial as in arc welding.

Cracks may appear in the weld. If both parts are rigid, weld shrinkage can produce high stress which may crack a brittle material (even if only after remelting by welding).

==Equipment==

Many welder types have been designed, differing in construction, working space volume, workpiece manipulators, and beam power. Electron-beam generators (electron guns) designed for welding applications can supply beams with power ranging from a few watts up to some one hundred kilowatts. &quot;Micro-welds&quot; of tiny components can be realized, as well as deep welds up to 300 mm or more. Vacuum working chamber volumes range from a few liters to hundreds of cubic meters.

The major EBW components are:

* Electron gun (beam generator)
* Vacuum chamber
* Workpiece manipulator (positioning mechanism)
* Power supply
* Control and monitoring electronics

=== Electron gun ===

==== Emitter ====
The electron gun generates, accelerates, and focuses the beam. Free electrons are gained by thermo-emission from a hot metal strap (or wire). 

==== Accelerator ====
They are then accelerated and formed into a narrow beam by an electric field produced by three electrodes: the electron emitting strap, the cathode connected to the negative pole of the high (accelerating) voltage power supply () and the anode. The third (Wehnelt or control) electrode is charged negatively with respect to the cathode. Its negative potential controls the portion of emitted electrons entering into the accelerating field, i.e., the electron-beam current. After passing the anode opening, the electrons move with constant speed in a slightly divergent cone.

==== Focuser ====
For technological applications the divergent beam has to be focused, which is realized by the magnetic field of a coil, the magnetic focusing lens.

The beam must be oriented to the optical axes of the accelerating electrical lens and the magnetic focusing lens. This can be done by applying a magnetic field of some specific radial direction and strength perpendicular to the optical axis before the focusing lens. This is usually realized by a simple correction system consisting of two pairs of coils. Adjusting the currents in these coils produces the correct field. 

==== Deflector ====
After passing the focusing lens, the beam can be applied for welding, either directly or after deflection by a deflection system. A deflection system This consists of two pairs of coils, one each for the and directions. These can be used for &quot;static&quot; or &quot;dynamic&quot; deflection. Static deflection is useful for exact positioning of the beam. Dynamic deflection is realized by supplying the deflection coils with currents controlled by a computer. The beam can then be redirected to meet the needs of applications beyond welding such as surface hardening, annealing, exact beam positioning, imaging, and engraving. Resolution of can be achieved.

=== Working chamber ===

Welding typically takes place in a working vacuum chamber in a high or low vacuum environment, although welders can also operate without a chamber.

Working chamber volumes range from a few liters up to hundreds of cubic meters. 

=== Workpiece manipulator ===

Electron-beam welding can never be &quot;hand-manipulated&quot;, even if not realized in vacuum, because of the presence of strong X-radiation. The relative motion of the beam and the workpiece is most often achieved by rotating or moving the workpiece or the beam. 

=== Power supply ===

Electron-beam equipment must be provided with an appropriate power supply. The accelerating voltage ranges from , typically . Technical challenges and equipment costs are an increasing function of the operating voltage.

The high-voltage equipment must also supply low voltage current, above , for the cathode heating, and negative voltage up to about for the control electrode.

The electron gun needs low-voltage supplies for the correction system, the focusing lens, and the deflection system.

=== Control and monitoring ===
Electronics control the workpiece manipulator, monitor the welding process, and adjust the various voltages needed for a specific application.

== Applications ==

=== Reactor pressure vessels ===
Such systems have been applied to welding reactor pressure vessels for small modular reactors, with enormous savings in time and costs over arc welding. Using arc welding on pressure vessels requires or more separate welds/cycles with additional processing for each cycle. Materials up to thick can be welded in a single pass. Shrinkage is minimal (heat treatment is advisable). Welds avoid oxide or nitride contamination. The material retains strength better. The weld has fewer flaws/voids. Less NDE is required.

=== Wind turbine ===
An offshore wind turbine can require arc-on hours of welding. Local vacuum EBM can replace this at far lower cost and time, with improved quality.

<doc id="758605" wikidata="Q13205" url="?curid=758605" title="Stade de France">
<text>Stade de France (, ) is the national stadium of France, located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis. Its seating capacity of 80,698 makes it the largest stadium in France. The architecture of the Stade de France is inspired by the Worldport of the American airline Pan American at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The stadium is used by the French national football and rugby union teams for international competitions. It is the largest in Europe for athletics events, seating 77,083 in that configuration. During other events, the stadium&#x27;s running track is mostly hidden under the grandstands. 

Initially built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2008 Summer Olympics failed bid the stadium&#x27;s name was recommended by Michel Platini, head of the organizing committee. On 12 July 1998, France beat Brazil 3–0 in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final held at the stadium. The Stadium was a key player in the success of the city&#x27;s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympic Games and also the Paralympics and in addition to hosting athletics and the closing ceremonies of both events. The stadium was rugby sevens venue during the Olympic Games. 

Stade de France, listed as a Category 4 stadium by UEFA, hosted matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League finals in 2000, 2006 and 2022. It has as well hosted the 1999, 2007 and 2023 Rugby World Cups, making it one of only two stadia in the world to have hosted both a FIFA World Cup final and a rugby union World Cup final (along with Nissan Stadium in Yokohama). It also hosted seven matches at UEFA Euro 2016, including the final, where France lost to Portugal 1–0 in a tense extra time. The facility also hosted the Race of Champions auto race in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The stadium hosted the 2003 World Championships in Athletics, and from 1999 to 2016, it hosted the annual Meeting Areva athletics meet.

Domestically, Stade de France serves as a secondary home facility of Parisian rugby clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, hosting a few of their regular-season fixtures. The stadium also hosts the main French domestic cup finals, which include the Coupe de France (both football and rugby), Coupe de la Ligue, Challenge de France, and the Coupe Gambardella, as well as the Top 14 rugby union championship match.

==History== 
The discussion about a new national stadium in France was asked during the bid process for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, when this issue was noted as one of the weaknesses of the Paris bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics. And despite the existing infrastructure, if the process won, there was a guarantee that the French government and the French Football Federation would build a stadium for more than 80 thousand people and that it would become the main stage of the event. With the confirmation of France&#x27;s choice announced on July 2, 1992, this new all-seater covered stadium was guaranteed and thus broke the country&#x27;s tradition of not building any new specific structure for a sporting event, as the last one was the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. Due to the magnitude and importance of the facility, the Council of State was allowed a first-hand approach to how the stadium would be constructed and paid for. The Council sought for the stadium to be built as close as possible to Paris and their metropolitan area, and that the constructor and operator of the facility would receive significant financial contributions for 30 months following the stadium&#x27;s completion. The architects Michel Macary, Aymeric Zublena, Michel Regembal, and Claude Constantini, who were associated with CR SCAU Architecture, handled the stadium&#x27;s design. 

The stadium was officially ready for construction following the government&#x27;s selection of manufacturers, Bouygues, Dumez, and SGE, and the signing of building permits on 30 April 1995. With only 31 months to complete the stadium, construction commenced on 2 May 1995. The first cornerstone was laid five months later, on 6 September. After over a year of construction, over of earthworks had been created, and as much as of concrete had been poured. The roof installation cost €45 million, and the mobile platform took over a year to complete.

During the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to in French as the &quot;Grand Stade&quot; (&quot;large stadium&quot;). On 4 December 1995, the Ministry of Sport launched a design competition to decide on a name for the stadium. The stadium was officially named Stade de France (France&#x27;s Stadium) after the Ministry heard a proposal from French football legend Michel Platini, who recommended the name. The total cost of the stadium was €364 million.

The stadium was inaugurated on 28 January 1998, with a friendly football match between France and Spain. The match was played in front of 78,368 spectators, which included President Jacques Chirac, with France winning the match 1–0 with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal, and the first-ever at Stade de France, in the 20th minute. Six months later, France returned to the stadium and defeated Brazil in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final to earn their first World Cup title. Stade de France has hosted group, quarter-final, semi-final and the final match of 1998 FIFA World Cup. The national rugby team&#x27;s first match in the facility was held five days after its opening, on 2 February, with France earning a 24–17 win over England in front of 77,567 spectators. Philippe Bernat-Salles converted the first ever try at the stadium scoring it in the 11th minute of play.

On 24 May 2000, Stade de France hosted the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final. In the match, which saw 78,759 spectators attend, Spanish club Real Madrid defeated fellow Spanish club Valencia 3–0. In 2003, Stade de France was the primary site of the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. Three years later, event returned to the stadium with another Spanish club Barcelona defeating England&#x27;s Arsenal 2–1. On 9 May 2009, Stade de France set the national attendance record for a sporting match played in France with 80,832 showing up to watch Guingamp upset Brittany rivals Rennes 2–1 in the 2009 Coupe de France Final. On 22 May 2010, Stade de France hosted the 2010 Heineken Cup Final. On 11 February 2012, a Six Nations international rugby game between France and Ireland had to be cancelled just before kick-off due to the pitch freezing as the stadium lacks under-soil heating.

On 13 November 2015, in one of a series of coordinated shootings and bombings across Paris, Stade de France was targeted. Two small proportion explosions occurred outside the stadium during an international friendly between France and Germany, with French President François Hollande in attendance. The terrorists, however, were unable to enter the stadium stands. The explosion was heard inside the stadium, and many thought it was a firework going off inside the stadium. The attacker wanted to infiltrate the stadium, but was scared away when he saw security and was forced to detonate outside the park. The authorities, aware of what had occurred outside the stadium, chose to continue the match out of concerns that cancelling it would have caused a panic. The stadium has since improved its counter-attack training and strengthened its security. There have since been new guidelines issued by the French police, with mixed reactions.
In 2016, Stade de France was used as the main stadium for the UEFA Euro 2016, hosting seven matches. The stadium was used for the opening ceremony of the tournament which saw French DJ David Guetta perform at the stadium. At the end of his set, Guetta invited Swedish singer Zara Larsson on stage to perform the tournament&#x27;s official song &quot;This One&#x27;s for You&quot;. Following the ceremony the stadium was used for the tournament&#x27;s opening game which saw France beat Romania 2–1. Across the next month, the stadium was used for six other tournament matches including the UEFA Euro 2016 Final between France and Portugal. The match followed the closing ceremony which again saw David Guetta perform. Portugal defeated France, 1–0 in extra time, winning the tournament for the first time.

For the third time in its history, the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final was held at the venue. This game between Liverpool F.C. and Real Madrid CF, was delayed because of difficulties admitting fans. The conclusions of the independent review, commissioned by UEFA, found that the early justification from UEFA—that the delay was due to late arriving supporters—was &quot;objectively untrue&quot;. The review found that two overarching organisational problems were responsible: the UEFA model for such matches which allowed for an absence of overall control, and the approach to policing the match which inappropriately assumed Liverpool FC supporters posed a public order risk.

==Architecture==

Stade de France has a movable stand which can be retracted to uncover part of the athletics track. The stadium was notably designed with the assistance of a software simulation of crowd in order to get an accurate observation of how it would look fully developed. The facility was also intended to draw interest in and develop the area of the Plaine Saint-Denis, which straddle the communes of Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Saint-Ouen. The primary goal was to renovate the area by building new residential and tertiary sites.

The stadium was built without any undersoil heating as noted when Ireland were due to play France in the Six Nations Tournament rugby union match of 2012, when the game had to be canceled.

In 2002, the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE) awarded a prize recognizing the unique structure of the stadium, commenting that Stade de France exhibited &quot;a construction of an attractive open architecture of the city, with an elegance and natural lightness&quot;.

===Roof===

Construction of the stadium&#x27;s roof cost over €45 million. Its elliptical shape symbolizes the universality of sport in France. Its area of six hectares and weight, 13,000 tons, is considered a technical marvel by many. It was designed to easily protect the 80,000 spectators without covering the playing field. All lighting and sound, which include 550 lights and 36 blocks of 5 speakers, are housed inside to avoid obstructing visibility. The tinted glass in the center reduces the contrast and distributes natural light. It filters out red and infrared radiation, however, it allows blue and green lights, due to their necessity involving the health of the turf.

==Interior==
===Stands===
Stade de France is the biggest modular stadium in the world. With a three modules structure, the first module has 25,000 seats. It is reached by level 1. It is partially retractable. To reveal the running track and jumping pits, the rear sections are lowered 7.1 m, then the inner sections retract 15 m into the space created, carried by ten distinct elements of 700 tons each. The tier then retains 22,000 seats. The transition takes 40 people and lasts 80 hours.

Access to the middle tier is through 22 bridges and can be found at level 3 with a concentration of restaurants, entertainment areas, shops and central station security.

Eighteen staircases lead viewers to the upper tier located at Level 6.

The evacuation procedures at the Stade de France are initiated about fifteen minutes prior to closing time. However, the actual time it takes to fully evacuate the stadium can vary depending on the number of attendees and the specific circumstances.

===Field===
Located at 11 meters below the court, the playing area measures 9,000 square meters (120 meters long and 75 meters wide) to a grassed area of 11,000 square meters. Nearly one billion seeds were sown to produce the first pitch in 1997. Today, the grass comes in rolls of 1.20 m x 8 m. Changing the pitch calls for three days of preparation and five days of installation. The change takes place several times a year, depending on the programming stage.
Unlike many other stadiums, Stade de France was built without under pitch heating, as the stadium was constructed on the site of an old gasworks, and there were concerns it could cause an explosion.

===Giant screens===

As part of its policy of renewing its infrastructure, Stade de France added two new big screens in September 2006. The new displays have a surface 58% greater than the previous screens installed in 1998. The newer giant screens are each composed of 4,423,680 light emitting diodes. They have faster response time and are brighter than the previous screens.

==Major sports matches==

Sporting events held at Stade de France include matches (preliminary contests as well as finals) of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup, UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The MLB World Tour in 2025 is also planned for the venue. It also hosted the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final after being moved from the Gazprom Arena in Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The following is the list of major matches held:
=== UEFA Champions League finals ===

===1998 FIFA World Cup matches===


===2003 FIFA Confederations Cup matches===


===2007 Rugby World Cup matches===


===UEFA Euro 2016 matches===


===2023 Rugby World Cup matches===


==Concerts==
The stadium is also used for large-scale music concerts. Global acts such as The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé, Coldplay, Depeche Mode, Muse, Metallica, Prince, U2, Mylène Farmer, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Rihanna, AC/DC, Justin Timberlake, Céline Dion, Tina Turner, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Madonna, The Police, BLACKPINK and BTS have performed here. 

==Noise record==
On 12 May 2012, the French heavy metal band Gojira performed at the stadium as the opening act for Metallica during their European Black Album Tour. Gojira&#x27;s concert was measured at 120 decibels in the corridors backstage, which broke the record for the loudest sound ever recorded at Stade de France.

On 11 April 2015, the crowd noise produced by the 80,000 people at Stade de France during the 2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final reached 109 decibels, which set the world record for the noisiest stadium recorded during a final match of a football tournament.

==Tenants==
Stade de France has as a regular tenant only the national football and national rugby teams. Repeated attempts to persuade a professional football or rugby team to move there have failed so far. Upon the construction of the stadium, Paris Saint-Germain declined to move there, choosing to remain at the Parc des Princes under pressure from its then-owner (pay-TV network Canal Plus) and the Paris city government.

However, the Paris rugby club Stade Français have now established themselves as a semi-regular tenant. They began by scheduling their Top 14 home fixture on 15 October 2005 against Toulouse at Stade de France. Stade Français&#x27;s president, Max Guazzini, publicly said that the club would have to sell 25,000 to 30,000 tickets to break even. Three weeks before the match, 61,000 tickets had been sold, setting a French record for tickets sold to a league match for any sport, including football. The final attendance was 79,454, smashing the national attendance record for a league match in any sport by more than 20,000. Five minutes before the end of the Toulouse match, Guazzini announced to the crowd that Stade Français&#x27;s scheduled home fixture against Biarritz in March 2006 would also be held at Stade de France. The Stade-Biarritz match broke the attendance record from earlier in the season, with 79,604 present.

Guazzini then booked Stade de France for the same two league fixtures in 2006–07. The Biarritz match on 16 October 2006 drew 79,619, making this the third consecutive Stade Français fixture at Stade de France to set an all-time French attendance record. The record was broken yet again at a match against Toulouse on 27 January 2007, with 79,741 filling the stands. Stade Français went on to schedule three home matches at Stade de France in the 2007–08 season. For the 2008–09 season, they booked Stade de France for three home league matches and a Heineken Cup pool match. The number of Stade Français home matches at Stade de France increased again for 2009–10, with five Top 14 fixtures already announced for the stadium.

Even with the lack of a regular league tenant, the stadium&#x27;s revenue increased greatly in 2007, as it was used extensively during the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, where it hosted numerous pool matches, a quarterfinal match, both of the semi-finals and the final.

The Lille OSC football team played all its &quot;home&quot; games in European competition during the 2005–06 season, both in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup, at Stade de France because its own stadium was then under renovation, and the only nearer alternative on French soil, Stade Félix-Bollaert, was not available as that ground&#x27;s occupant, Lille&#x27;s local rival Lens, was also participating in the UEFA Cup. Stade de France has hosted the Champions League final on three occasions: 2000 (Real Madrid 3 Valencia 0), 2006 (Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1), and 2022 (Real Madrid 1 Liverpool 0),

===Future developments and the 2024 Summer Olympics===
France&#x27;s governing body for rugby union, the French Rugby Federation (FFR), announced in November 2010 that it would not renew its deal to use Stade de France for international rugby matches when it expired in 2013. FFR also stated that it planned to build a new stadium of its own in the Paris region.

Reportedly, the FFR had become increasingly frustrated with several aspects of the deal. According to rugby journalist Ian Moriarty, &quot;The deal with the Stade de France has been a disaster for the FFR financially over the years, forcing France&#x27;s powerbrokers to look across the English channel at the RFU&#x27;s Twickenham cash cow with ever increasing envy.&quot; Reports vary widely as to how much the FFR must spend to rent out the stadium, but estimates range from €3 million to €5 million per match. Although Stade de France and Twickenham are roughly the same size, the rental expense means that the FFR reportedly makes about one-third as much from a Stade de France sellout as does the RFU from a sellout at Twickenham. In addition, the national rugby team does not enjoy primacy at Stade de France; the national football team and major concerts take priority. FFR had to move two of its 2010–11 home Tests to Montpellier and Nantes due to fixture clashes with the national football team. Also, former FFR president Serge Blanco claimed that the 2009 Top 14 final had to be moved from May to June because of a conflict with a Johnny Hallyday rock concert.

In June 2012, FFR announced that it had selected the site for its new ground, tentatively known as Grand Stade FFR. The 82,000-seat stadium, featuring a retractable roof and slide-out pitch, was to be built on a former horse racing track in Évry, about south of Paris. The new stadium, estimated to cost €600 million, was originally scheduled to open in 2017, but completion was later pushed back to the 2021/2022 time frame. FFR officially abandoned the stadium project in December 2016.

==Access==
Although located at the crossroads of auto-routes A1 and A86, it is not advisable to go there by car unless one has reserved parking. The stadium was built with a very limited number of parking spaces, which is why public transportation is considered the primary means of getting to the stadium. River shuttles are provided by the Canal Saint-Denis.

As part of the Grand Paris Express project and 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a new station at is under construction, connected by a bridge to the Stade de France–Saint-Denis station. Initially served by Line 14 in time for the Games, the station will eventually serve 4 different Métro lines.

<text>Saunders Terrell (October 24, 1911 – March 11, 1986), known as Sonny Terry, was an American Piedmont blues and folk musician, who was known for his energetic blues harmonica style, which frequently included vocal whoops and hollers and occasionally imitations of trains and fox hunts.

==Career==

Terry was born in Greensboro, Georgia. His father, a farmer, taught him to play basic blues harp as a youth. He sustained injuries to his eyes and went blind by the time he was 16, which prevented him from doing farm work, and was forced to play music in order to earn a living. Terry played &quot;Camptown Races&quot; to the plow horses which improved the efficiency of farming in the area. He began playing blues in Shelby, North Carolina. After his father died, he began playing with Piedmont blues–style guitarist Blind Boy Fuller. When Fuller died in 1941, Terry established a long-standing musical relationship with Brownie McGhee, and they recorded numerous songs together. The duo became well known among white audiences during the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including for collaborations with Styve Homnick, Woody Guthrie and Moses Asch, producing classic recordings for Folkways Records (now Smithsonian/Folkways).

In 1938, Terry was invited to play at Carnegie Hall for the first &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert, and later that year he recorded for the Library of Congress. He recorded his first commercial sides in 1940. Among his most famous works are &quot;Old Jabo&quot;, a song about a man bitten by a snake, and &quot;Lost John&quot;, which demonstrates Terry&#x27;s precisely honed breath control.

Despite their fame as &quot;pure&quot; folk artists, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee fronted a jump blues combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, which was variously billed as &quot;Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers&quot; or &quot;Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five&quot;.

Terry was in the 1947 original cast of the Broadway musical comedy &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. With McGhee, he appeared in the 1979 Steve Martin comedy &quot;The Jerk&quot;. Terry also appeared in the 1985 film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg. Terry collaborated with Ry Cooder on &quot;Walkin&#x27; Away Blues&quot;, and also performed a cover of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot; for the 1986 film &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

Terry and McGhee were both recipients of a 1982 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. That year&#x27;s fellowships were the first bestowed by the NEA.

Terry died of natural causes in Mineola, New York, in March 1986, three days before &quot;Crossroads&quot; was released in theaters. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in the same year.

<doc id="758609" wikidata="Q5350795" url="?curid=758609" title="El Baile Alemán">
<text>El Baile Alemán (&quot;The German Dance&quot; in Spanish) is a cover album by Señor Coconut y Su Conjunto which was released on 23 December 1999 on vinyl in the US and released on other formats and regions on 26 January 2000. It consists of Kraftwerk covers done in a Latin American style.

Although mostly note-for-note covers, some tracks add embellishments such as &quot;cha-cha-chas&quot;, or minor changes to the song, like incorporating Latin Radio into the radio transmission in &quot;Autobahn&quot;. The song &quot;Home Computer&quot; also has some lyrics from &quot;It&#x27;s More Fun to Compute&quot; from the album &quot;Computer World&quot;.

&quot;Tour de France&quot; was released as a remixed single. The single release also includes vocal and instrumental cover versions of &quot;Expo 2000&quot;, which are not included on the album.

Early copies of the album opened with &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; and included a cover of &quot;Radioactivity&quot; as the second track. At the request of the original songwriters, &quot;Radioactivity&quot; was taken off the album. All subsequent issues of the album were resequenced, placing &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot; as the second track and inserting a spoken track &quot;Introducción&quot; at the start of the album.

<doc id="758612" wikidata="Q2967306" url="?curid=758612" title="Railroad chronometer">
<text>A railroad chronometer or railroad standard watch is a specialized timepiece that once was crucial for safe and correct operation of trains in many countries. A system of timetable and train order, which relied on highly accurate timekeeping, was used to ensure that two trains could not be on the same stretch of track at the same time.

==Overview==
Regulations of the watches used by critical personnel on the railroads (engineer, conductor, switch yard controllers, etc.) were specified almost from the beginning of widespread railroad use in the 1850s and 1860s. These regulations became more widespread and more specific as time went on, with some watches that were &quot;railroad standard&quot; at an earlier time eventually becoming obsolete as technology improved. There was, however, no absolute, universal definition used across different railroad lines. Each company appointed one or more &quot;time inspectors&quot; (typically a watchmaker) who decided which watches were acceptable for use. In the United States, the American Railway Association held a meeting in 1887, which resulted a fairly standardized set of requirements, but not all railroads adopted them.

==Webb C. Ball==
One notable watch inspector was Webb C. Ball. His first job as a time inspector was when he was brought in by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railways in 1891 after a crash and was tasked with bringing their time inspection standards up to industry normals. Ball&#x27;s career eventually led to his being the time inspector on more than half the United States&#x27; railways, leading to a far more uniform set of standards in the U.S.

==Typical requirements==
A typical railroad&#x27;s requirements for a watch in the early 20th century might include: 

* only American-made watches and certain approved Swiss watches may be used (depending on availability of spare parts)
* only open-faced dials, with the stem at 12 o&#x27;clock post 1908
* minimum of 15 functional jewels in the movement (pre-1895), changed to 17 jewels post 1895
* 16 or 18-size only
* maximum variation of 30 seconds (approximately 4 seconds daily) per weekly check
* watch adjusted to at least three positions (pre-1895), later changed to five positions: Face up and face down (the positions a watch might commonly take when laid on a flat surface); then crown up, crown pointing left, and crown pointing right (the positions a watch might commonly take in a pocket). Occasionally a sixth position, crown pointing down, would be included.
* adjusted for severe temperature variance and isochronism (variance in spring tension)
* indication of time with bold legible Roman numerals or Arabic numerals, Arabic numerals only post 1906, outer minute division, second dial, heavy hands,
* lever used to set the time (no risk of inadvertently setting the watch to an erroneous time, when winding the watch with the stem) post 1908. Pendent set watches were grandfathered.
* Breguet balance spring
* micrometer adjustment regulator
* single roller escapement (pre-1908), double roller escapement
* steel escape wheel
* anti-magnetic protection (after the advent of diesel-electric locomotives)

The minimum requirements were raised several times as watch-making technology progressed, and the watch companies produced newer, even more reliable models. By World War II, many railroads required watches that were of a much higher grade than those made to comply with the original 1891 standard.

==Manufacturers==
The Waltham Watch Company and the Elgin Watch Company were both used as early as the 1860s and 1870s as railroad standard watches. Later, Hamilton Watch Company, Illinois Watch Company and many of the other American watch manufacturers all produced railroad-grade watches like the Ball Watch Company.

The Time Signal Service of the United States Naval Observatory was used to ensure accuracy of railroad chronometers and schedule American rail transport.

==Early life==
Park was born in Canandaigua, New York, but spent a year of his childhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
Park attended Nazareth College, Rochester, New York, originally intending to become an architect, before deciding to become an actor. He worked in the 1992 New Plays Festival at Geva Theatre in Rochester. He appeared in regional productions including &quot;Ellen Universe Joins The Band&quot; and &quot;Peephole&quot;.

In 1994, Park appeared in the musical &quot;Hello Again&quot; at Lincoln Center Theater. In August 1994, Park was in the Goodspeed Opera House production of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, and &quot;Good News&quot; at the North Shore Music Theatre (1994). After understudying Billy Bigelow in the 1994 revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot;, he made his Broadway debut in 1995 in &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot;. In 1997, Park played Monty in the Playwrights Horizons production of &quot;Violet&quot;.

The day after &quot;Violet&quot; opened was Park&#x27;s first day in the long-running daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Jack Snyder, joining in April 1997. Park received three Emmy nominations and several other soap-opera acting awards, including winning the 2010 and 2011 Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.

During his 13-year tenure in &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, he continued to work in theatre, playing Lucky Malone in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s revival of &quot;Little Me&quot; (1998). He made two New York City Center Encores! appearances: &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; in 2001 as Jeff Calhoun, and &quot;Applause&quot; in 2008 as Bill Sampson.

With &quot;As the World Turns&quot; coming to an end in June 2010, Park returned to the stage, and played the role of Pete&#x27;s ghost father who appeared to his son as three &quot;Alamo&quot; characters in the coming-of-age musical &quot;The Burnt Part Boys&quot; at Playwrights Horizon. In the summer of 2010, he appeared as Lord Capulet in the musical &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot; at Williamstown Theatre Festival. Park then appeared as the cop in Will Eno&#x27;s play &quot;Middletown&quot; at the off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre (2010).

Park performed in the role of Bert Bratt in the Broadway revival &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (2011), starring Daniel Radcliffe and John Larroquette.

In the 2012 independent financial thriller film &quot;Supercapitalist&quot;, Park appears as Morris Brown, co-starring along with Linus Roache.

On December 5, 2013, he participated as a cast member of the NBC telecast production of &quot;The Sound of Music Live!&quot; starring Carrie Underwood. He played Cecco, one of Captain Hook&#x27;s pirates, in the NBC presentation of &quot;Peter Pan Live!&quot; starring Allison Williams and Christopher Walken; the musical was broadcast on December 4, 2014.

Park has appeared in episodes of numerous television series, including &quot;The Good Wife&quot; (2012), &quot;The Blacklist&quot; (2016), &quot;You&quot; (2018, two episodes), &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; (2018), and &quot;FBI&quot; (2021).

In 2015, he originated the role of Larry Murphy in the world premiere of the stage musical &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot; at Washington, DC&#x27;s Arena Stage. He was not in the off-Broadway run, starting in early 2016, as he was appearing in the Broadway musical, &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot;. He returned to &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot; in the fall of 2016 when the musical made its debut on Broadway. For his work in &quot;Dear Evan Hansen&quot;, Michael Park earned the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album and his third Daytime Emmy Award, this one a Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Musical Performance in a Daytime Program for his and the rest of the cast&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; performance that was broadcast on April 25, 2017.

In 2022, Park played Philip Abshire in the HBO series &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

<doc id="758617" wikidata="Q455063" url="?curid=758617" title="Amargosa River">
<text>The Amargosa River is an intermittent waterway, 185 miles (298 km) long, in southern Nevada and eastern California in the United States. The Amargosa River is one out of two rivers located in the California portion of the Mojave Desert with perennial flow. It drains a high desert region, the Amargosa Valley in the Amargosa Desert northwest of Las Vegas, into the Mojave Desert, and finally into Death Valley where it disappears into the ground aquifer. Except for a small portion of its route in the Amargosa Canyon in California and a small portion at Beatty, Nevada, the river flows above ground only after a rare rainstorm washes the region. A 26-mile (42 km) stretch of the river between Shoshone and Dumont Dunes is protected as a National Wild and Scenic River. At the south end of Tecopa Valley the Amargosa River Natural Area protects the habitat.

==Course==
Except during flash floods that occur after cloudbursts, most of the course of the Amargosa River is dry on the surface. The flow is generally underground except for stretches near Beatty and near Tecopa, California, in the Amargosa Canyon. In the canyon, the river passes through the Amargosa River Natural Area, a region of dense greenery and prolific wildlife made possible by the presence of water.

The river arises at about above sea level in Nye County, Nevada, along the southern side of Pahute Mesa in the Nellis Air Force Range. Thirsty Canyon Wash enters at the river&#x27;s source, and when carrying water, the river flows from there southwest into Oasis Valley. Running parallel to U.S. Route 95 near the Bullfrog Hills to the west (), the river receives Sober-Up Gulch from the right and then Beatty Wash from the .

Another or so downstream, the river flows through Beatty and turns south-southeast through the Amargosa Narrows into the Amargosa Desert. At this point, Bare Mountain lies to the left, and the Grapevine and Funeral Mountains of the Amargosa Range lie to the right. Downstream of the Narrows, still flowing roughly parallel to Route 95, the river passes Big Dune, which is on the river&#x27;s left. Shortly after that, it passes the town of Amargosa Valley on the left, leaves Nevada, and enters Inyo County, California. In this stretch, it receives Forty Mile Wash from the left.
Running roughly parallel to California Route 127, the river passes through Death Valley Junction. Shortly after, it receives Carson Slough, which drains Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, from the left. Soon the river passes between the Resting Spring Range to the left and the Greenwater Range to the right before reaching Shoshone. Below Shoshone, the river continues roughly parallel to Route 127 to Tecopa. Downstream of Tecopa, with the Old Spanish Trail, it passes through the Amargosa Canyon between the Sperry Hills on the right and the Dumont Hills on the left, enters San Bernardino County, California, and flows by Dumont Dunes in the northern Mojave Desert. Turning west, the river crosses under Route 127 and enters Death Valley National Park between the south end of the Amargosa Range on the right and the Avawatz Mountains on the left.

Turning northwest and then north, the river re-enters Inyo County, passing between the Owlshead Mountains on the left and the Ibex Hills on the right and receives Confidence Wash and Rhodes Wash, both from the right.
In this stretch, the river runs roughly parallel to Harry Wade Road and, further north, to California Route 178 and West Side Road. The river receives Willow Creek from the right and ends in Badwater Basin, about below sea level, between the Black Mountains on the right and the Panamint Range on the left. Disappearing into the ground, it feeds the aquifer that is the remnant of prehistoric Lake Manly.

===Discharge===

The United States Geological Survey monitors the flow of the Amargosa River at a gauge station near the Old Spanish Trail Road, west of Tecopa. The average flow of the river at this station is . This is from a drainage area of , much of which is noncontributing and all of which represents about 60 percent of the total Amargosa River drainage basin. The maximum flow recorded there was on August 16, 1983, and the minimum flow was on some days in some years.

== Wildlife ==
&quot;The wildlife within the Amargosa River region, nestled in a portion of the Mojave Desert designated is an &quot;Area of Critical Environmental Concern&quot; according to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and is under protection to conserve the diverse plant and animal species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Among these endangered species are the Amargosa vole, Least Bell&#x27;s Vireo, and Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, recognized at both state and federal levels. Moreover, the state of California acknowledges the Yellow-Billed Cuckoo, Swainson&#x27;s Hawk, and Amargosa Niterwort as species under threat. Additionally, two desert fish species, the Amargosa Pupfish and Amargosa Speckled Dace, inhabit these regions and hold the designation of sensitive species according to the BLM.&quot; 

=== Desert Fish Species ===

=== Amargosa Pup Fish ===
&quot;The Amargosa River Pupfish (Cyprinodon nevadensis amargosae) are one of the most notable residents of the Amargosa River. The species seems to be flourishing in the Amargosa Canyon, where its habitat has been safeguarded as a Wild and Scenic River, largely due to the efforts of the Amargosa Conservancy.&quot;&quot;They primarily reproduce in loose groups, with males displaying minimal aggression and frequently engaging in courtship behavior towards females. However, a subset of males in this population stake out and protect specific breeding territories along the warm, shallow areas of the river. These territorial males exhibit aggression and only occasionally engage in courtship behaviors towards females&quot; 

=== Amargosa Speckled Dace ===
&quot;The Amargosa River hosts three separate populations of Speckled Dace, situated in Oasis Valley near Beatty, Ash Meadows, and the Amargosa Canyon. An interesting revelation concerns the genetic makeup of these fish, indicating an unexpected level of connectivity along the river. Particularly noteworthy is the genetic blend observed in the speckled dace population of the Amargosa Canyon, incorporating traits from both the Oasis Valley and Ash Meadows populations. This suggests that during significant flood events, speckled dace are capable of traversing considerable distances along the Amargosa River, covering nearly 100 miles from Beatty to below Tecopa. These findings propose a level of interconnection among these populations not previously recognized in the pupfish.&quot; 

== Conservation efforts ==
=== Amargosa River Project ===
&quot;The Amargosa River is home to several crucial conservation areas, highlighting a diverse array of habitats like dunes, mesquite forests, springs, marshes, and riverbanks, all interconnected across the expansive watershed. Stretching nearly 3 million acres along the California-Nevada border, this region faces threats from urban development, recreation, and invasive species. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is actively working to protect this ecosystem by preserving natural water flow, safeguarding native species like Amargosa Pupfish and Speckled Dace, as well as restoring critical habitats. The Nature Conservancy’s goal is to ensure the health of the natural water flow and processes in the Amargosa River area, supporting essential plants and animals. They also strive to maintain healthy populations of native fish, including Pupfish, Speckled dace, and Amargosa Toads. Moreover, they aim to enhance connections between various habitats, such as springs and upland areas, and restore natural conditions of springs and riverbanks to benefit native fish, amphibians, and snails. Collaborating with local public land management agencies, TNC plans sustainable land management strategies that prioritize nature long term. These efforts are vital for the survival of over 100 targeted plant and animal species, many of which are unique to the area.  Protecting these habitats&#x27; integrity is essential for maintaining connectivity among different ecosystems and ensuring the watershed&#x27;s overall health. &quot;

==History==
The name of the river comes from the Spanish word, &quot;amargo&quot;, for &quot;bitter&quot;, probably shortened from &quot;agua amargosa&quot;, &quot;bitter water&quot;. The name was first recorded in 1844 and is believed to refer to the alkaline water. The river is an ancient stream, following an antecedent canyon. Evidence of human habitation along the river goes back more than 10,000 years. In addition to prehistoric Lake Manly in Death Valley, the middle river valley was submerged during the late Pleistocene by prehistoric Lake Tecopa.

The canyon floor along the Amargosa Range has remnants of indigenous habitations that are protected by the Bureau of Land Management. The Old Spanish Trail followed the course of the river in the Amargosa Canyon during the 19th century. From 1907 to 1941, the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad followed the lower course of the river serving remote Death Valley communities.

In March 2009, as part of the Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wild Heritage Act, a stretch of the river between Shoshone and Dumont Dunes was protected as a Wild and Scenic River.

<doc id="758618" wikidata="Q2623146" url="?curid=758618" title="Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act">
<text>The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) is a United States federal law signed by President Jimmy Carter on December 2, 1980. ANILCA provided varying degrees of special protection to over of land, including national parks, national wildlife refuges, national monuments, wild and scenic rivers, recreational areas, national forests, and conservation areas. It was, and remains to date, the single largest expansion of protected lands in history and more than doubled the size of the National Park System.

The Act provided for of new national parklands in Alaska; the addition of to the National Wildlife Refuge System; twenty-five wild and scenic rivers, with twelve more to be studied for that designation; establishment of Misty Fjords and Admiralty Island National Monuments in Southeast Alaska; establishment of Steese National Conservation Area and White Mountains National Recreation Area to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management; the addition of to the Wilderness Preservation System, and the addition of to Tongass and Chugach National Forests.

==Protected areas==

The act provided for the creation or expansion of several Conservation System Units (CSUs) including:

* significant changes to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
* Admiralty Island National Monument
* Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve
* Bering Land Bridge National Preserve
* Cape Krusenstern National Monument
* Denali National Park
* Gates Of The Arctic National Park and Preserve
* Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve
* Katmai National Park and Preserve
* Kenai Fjords National Park
* Kenai National Wildlife Refuge
* Kobuk Valley National Park
* Lake Clark National Park and Preserve
* Misty Fjords National Monument
* Noatak National Preserve
* Wrangell - St Elias National Park and Preserve
* Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve
* Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge
* Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge

==Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act==
In 1971 the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law to resolve the long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska. Section 17(d)(1) gave the Secretary of the Interior ninety days to withdraw from development any lands necessary &quot;to insure that the public interest in these lands is properly protected.&quot; Additionally, Section 17(d)(2) directed the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw up to 80 million acres of land from development for conservation purposes. These lands, referred to as &quot;d-2&quot; lands, were to be available for potential congressional designation as National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, Wild and Scenic rivers, or National Forests. The &quot;d-2&quot; provision of ANCSA gave the Secretary nine months to withdraw lands before they would re-open to development. On December 17, 1972, Interior Secretary Rogers Morton forwarded of selected lands to Congress under 17(d)(1) and 17(d)(2), known as the &quot;Morton Proposal.&quot; These lands were withdrawn from all forms of public appropriation under the public land laws pending action from Congress, setting the stage for the eventual passage of ANILCA.

==Sunset provisions==
As stated, the &quot;d-2&quot; provision of ANCSA set a deadline for the Secretary to withdraw lands within nine months of the passage of ANCSA. In addition, ANCSA also set a deadline for Congress to act on the Secretary&#x27;s withdrawal within five years of the passage of ANCSA; if the Secretary did not act to withdraw lands earmarked for special protections within nine months of the passage of ANCSA, or Congress did not act to implement the Secretary&#x27;s selection within five years of the passage of ANCSA, the lands would be reopened to development.

==Early Legislation==
On January 29, 1973, Congressman James A. Haley (D-Florida) introduced the Morton proposal as H.R. 12336, and the next day Senator Henry M. Jackson (D-Washington) introduced the Senate version of the bill. These bills were the first of many failed proposals leading to the eventual passage of ANILCA seven years later. Over the course of the seven years many bills were introduced with a wide range of proposals for disposal of the selected lands.

As the sunset date approached in 1978 both chambers of Congress scrambled to pass a bill. On May 19, 1978, H.R. 39 was passed by the House of Representatives. H.R. 39 was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for mark up and combined with a number of other bills pertaining to Alaska lands. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) was instrumental in making significant changes to the original House resolution. The final bill submitted by the Senate energy committee was deemed unacceptable by the Carter administration and supporters of H.R. 39 in the House. With limited time left before adjournment, the House and Senate conferenced in order to resolve differences between the two bills. Senator Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) inserted himself into the negotiations, making a number of new demands not included in either bill. Changes made to the bill did not satisfy Gravel, and he refused to support the bill. With adjournment fast approaching, a provision to extend the (d)(2) protections for one more year to allow for additional time to pass a bill was passed in the House, and introduced in the Senate on October 16, 1978. Gravel threatened a filibuster, and the provision did not pass the Senate. The sunset provision of section (d)(2) of ANCSA was set to expire on December 18, 1978.

==Use of the Antiquities Act==

The Interior Department and the National Park Service became concerned as 1978 dragged on that no action would be taken on the &quot;national interest lands&quot; included in the Morton Proposal, and as early as July 1978 the Park Service had taken the first steps to secure additional protection when it began to draft national monument proclamations for proposed NPS areas.

President Carter used the Antiquities Act to designate as 17 National Monuments by executive order on December 1, 1978. Much of the lands designated as National Monument were part of the original Morton Proposal. An additional were withdrawn under the authority of section 204(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act by Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus.

Carter stated that he had been forced to use the Antiquities Act by Congress&#x27;s failure to act in a reasonable time, but his actions nevertheless caused wide protest across Alaska. President Carter was burned in effigy in Fairbanks. Residents in the Cantwell area undertook a large act of civil disobedience known as the &quot;Great Denali Trespass&quot;they went into the park, fired off guns, made campfires, and conducted various other activities prohibited under Federal regulations. The towns of Eagle and Glennallen, both in the shadow of new monuments, produced official proclamations stating that the towns would not support NPS authorities, not enforce NPS regulations, and would shelter individuals who broke the regulations.

Though these protests continued for some time, the designation of the monuments broke the legislative opposition to ANILCA. Some in Congress, and various oil and gas industry, and other development interest, continued to oppose passage of the bill, but in the wake of Carter&#x27;s proclamations most opponents recognized the need to work toward passage of an acceptable bill, rather than no bill at all. However, in 1978, 75 seats in the House had changed hands, producing a much more conservative body than the one that had supported Carter&#x27;s use of the Antiquities Act. Proponents were forced to continue to work compromises, and the bill&#x27;s passage was further delayed.

==Final passage==

In early November 1980, Jimmy Carter lost re-election to Ronald Reagan, and the Republican Party won a majority of seats in the Senate. Conservationists and other proponents of the legislation recognized that if they did not accept the compromise then on the table, they would be forced to begin again in the next Congress with decidedly less support. The bill was passed in late November, and signed into law by President Carter in December.

==Selected provisions==
* Lands claimed by Alaska Natives under ANCSA are officially recognized.
* Native land claims pending as of December 18, 1971, are officially approved.
* Existing timber contracts are to be filled with timber from other national forest lands.
* If private land is surrounded by conservation system units &quot;adequate and feasible&quot; access must be guaranteed.

==Ramifications==
Senator Gravel, meanwhile, took considerable blame in Alaska for forcing Carter&#x27;s hand with the Antiquities Act. Though Carter was hardly held blameless for the creation of the new national monuments, Gravel was taken to task for the unpopular decision as well and was denied his party&#x27;s nomination for his Senate seat in the 1980 election.

With the passage of time, however, and now, several decades later, support for the vision of ANILCA has increased, even among former detractors in Alaskaas the spectacular parks, monuments, refuges and other areas set aside by the 1980 legislation have become a significant boon to Alaska tourism and the State&#x27;s economy. A telephone poll in 2000 showed that 45 percent of Alaskans supported the protection of the ANILCA-designated 1002 coastal plain area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the most controversial aspect of ANILCA&#x27;s protected areas, while 49 percent opposed the protection.

The final bill accelerated logging in the Tongass National Forest, the nation&#x27;s largest, by giving the US Forest Service a yearly $40,000,000 appropriation to cut timber, not subject to the appropriation laws but derived from the taxes on oil etc, and by providing that 450 million board feet of trees would be clearcut each year. This was the price conservationists paid in the compromise. 

===Impact on Alaska Natives===
Under Title VIII, Subsistence Management And Use, not just Alaska Natives qualified but also rural residents were granted hunting and fishing rights when fish and game are not under outside threat. In addition the bill expedited the enactment of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

<doc id="758620" wikidata="Q4969577" url="?curid=758620" title="British Birdwatching Fair">
<text>The British Birdwatching Fair or Birdfair is an annual event for birdwatchers, held every August at Rutland Water in England, run by staff and volunteers from the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The birdfairs in 2020 and 2021 were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic and in November 2021 the fair was permanently discontinued over financial concerns. By January 2022, however, one of the original conceivers of the Birdfair, Tim Appleton MBE, announced a new event under the guise of ″Global BirdFair″. In March 2022 an official announcement was made that Global Birdfair would take place at a new location, Rutland Showground, from 15–17 July. 

It has been described as &quot;the birder&#x27;s Glastonbury&quot;. A large number of suppliers of binoculars, cameras, books, clothing and other birdwatching equipment, plus artists and tour companies, display and sell their wares. There are also lectures and other attractions. The first fair was held in 1989. All the organisers&#x27; profits are donated to a charity, Birdlife International. Prior to the 2008 fair, visitors had contributed £1,488,000 to international bird conservation. The 2018 fair raised £322,000, making a total of £4,679,152 since the inception.

Other countries are replicating the fair, including the South American Bird Fair, which was first held in 2010 and the Amazon Birding Fest since 2019.

<text>Hastings Edward Harington VC (9 November 1832 – 20 July 1861) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Harington was born in St Peter Port, Guernsey in 1832, the son of a reverend, and educated at Reading School and the East India Company Military Seminary, Addiscombe, Surrey.

==Military career==
Harington&#x27;s military career began on 12 June 1852, when he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Bengal Artillery. During the Indian Mutiny he was severely wounded at Trimmoo Ghat. He was present throughout the Siege of Delhi, and after the fall of the city he proceeded with the Grethed&#x27;s column towards Cawnpore, taking an active part in the engagements at Maligurh Fort, Allygurh and Agra. He was present at the relief of the garrison at Lucknow, where he risked his life rescuing a wounded soldier, his courage gaining him the Victoria Cross. He was elected for the VC by the vote of his fellow officers. During these operations he was most dangerously wounded.

He then took part in the pursuit of the rebels towards Rohileund until he was severely wounded at Rooyah. This last wound compelled him to go to the Himalayas to recover his health; but deriving only temporary relief and still being troubled by a bullet which remained in his back, he returned to England, where after undergoing an operation the bullet was extracted. His health being partially restored he returned to duty in October 1860. Shortly after his arrival in India he proceeded on service with the Sikkim Field Force. He was afterwards appointed adjutant 6th Battalion Bengal Artillery at Agra, where he died from cholera on 20 July 1861, having achieved the rank of captain. He was buried in Agra Cemetery.

== The Victoria Cross ==
Harington was 25 years old, and a Lieutenant in the Bengal Artillery, Indian Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deeds took place at the Relief of Lucknow for which he was awarded the VC, the citation reading as follows:

His family sold the medal in 2024.

<text>Kathryn Hays (born Kay Piper; July 26, 1934 – March 25, 2022) was an American actress, best known for her role as Kim Hughes on the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1972 to 2010.

== Life and career ==
Hays was born as Kay Piper in Princeton, Illinois, on July 26, 1934, the only child of Roger and Daisy (Hays) Piper. Her parents divorced shortly after her birth. Hays was raised by her mother, who was a bookkeeper and a banker, and her stepfather, salesman Arnold Gottlieb.

She grew up in Joliet.
She took classes at Northwestern University, and worked as a model. In 1962, she changed her name to Kathryn Hays (using her mother&#x27;s maiden name as her last name).

Hays&#x27; first marriage was to salesman Sidney Steinberg in 1957, with whom she had a daughter, Sherri. In 1966, Hays married actor Glenn Ford; the couple divorced in 1969. Her third husband was Wolfgang Lieschke, who was employed in the advertising industry.

=== Episodic TV work ===
Early in her career, Hays made numerous appearances on episodic TV, and made a few later in her career. In 1968, she appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot; as the eponymous central character in the episode “The Empath”, playing a mute alien with healing powers. She also had appearances in &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;The Road West&quot;. In a 2010 interview with the website &quot;We Love Soaps&quot;, Hays said of the early appearances: &quot;It was a great time to begin a career. It was when the guest stars on the primetime shows were almost always women. The running star would be a man. The main storyline would be a very rich part to play.&quot;

Hays also appeared in films such as &quot;Ride Beyond Vengeance&quot; (1966) and &quot;Counterpoint&quot; (1968) and in the TV film &quot;Yuma&quot; as Julie Williams. In later years, her TV appearances included &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

Hays appeared in Broadway productions several times, including a regional production of &quot;Dames at Sea&quot; with Bernadette Peters.

=== &quot;As the World Turns&quot; ===

In 1972, she was cast as Kim Sullivan Hughes on CBS&#x27;s &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. She remained with &quot;As the World Turns&quot; until its final episode on September 17, 2010. The character of Kim was a pivotal heroine on the show for over thirty years. Hays was prominently featured in the 50th anniversary episode of the show, which aired in April 2006.

Prior to her role on &quot;As the World Turns,&quot; Hays played the role of nurse Leslie Jackson Bauer, RN on &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;.

In May 2020, she appeared in an &quot;As The World Turns&quot; reunion episode of &quot;The Locher Room&quot;, one of a series of YouTube episodes reuniting various soap actors, as well as being the subject of a &quot;The Locher Room&quot; tribute in 2022.

==Death ==
Hays died on March 25, 2022. She had been living in an assisted living facility at the time of her death. Her daughter, Sherri Mancusi, participated in a November 2022 fan tribute on &quot;The Locher Room&quot; YouTube channel that honored Hays; in the interview, Mancusi said that Hays had had dementia in the years prior to her death.

<text>Timofey Mikhailovich Mikhailov (; — 15 April 1881) was a member of the Russian revolutionary organization Narodnaya Volya. He was designated a bomb-thrower in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, however he did not throw a bomb.

Mikhailov, a discontented workman, claimed in his trial that he was motivated by a desire to improve the condition of the working classes. He was promptly condemned to death, and was hanged along with four other conspirators.

==Early life==
Mikhailov was born 1860 in Smolensk. His parents Mikhail Nefedov and Natalia Savelyeva were Orthodox peasants. He had sisters Malanya and Matrena, and brothers Grigory and Stepan.

In 1875 Mikhailov moved to Saint Petersburg to earn a living. He worked as a boiler maker. Having worked in multiple plants, he left his last job in 1880 due to low wages. At this time, Mikhailov became involved in revolutionary politics and joined the Workers&#x27; Section of Narodnaya Volya. Mikhailov then started living under the false name &quot;Sergei I. Lapin&quot;.

==Assassination of the Tsar==

Two weeks prior to the incident, Timofey Mikhailov volunteered to join the bomb-thrower unit to assassinate Tsar Alexander II, and was recruited by Andrei Zhelyabov. The group had observed that on Sundays, after the inspection of marine corps at Michael Manege, the Tsar would drive back to the Winter Palace. His route would be either by the Sadovaya Street or the Catherine Canal. The group had purchased a shop in the Sadovaya ostensibly for the sale of cheese, and used that as a cover to place dynamites under the street. If, on the other hand, the Tsar passed by the Canal, it was decided that the bomb-throwers were to be relied upon for the assassination.

On the morning of 13 March [1 March, Old Style], Mikhailov and the three other bomb-throwers collected their missiles from the group&#x27;s headquarters. In the afternoon, the conspirators found that the Tsar had paid a brief visit to his cousin, the Grand Duchess Catherine, and was heading back to the Winter Palace via the road alongside the Catherine Canal. The four bomb-throwers were supposed to take up their new positions along the Canal. Mikhailov lost his nerve, returned his missile to the group&#x27;s headquarters and went home. He, therefore, did not participate in the subsequent bombing attack that killed the Emperor.

==Arrest and trial==
Two days after the assassination, Mikhailov arrived at the group&#x27;s Telezhnaya quarters following the arrest of Hesya Helfman. When the police began to frisk him, Mikhailov took out a revolver and fired six shots, wounding three police officers. He was seized and was subsequently identified by Nikolai Rysakov.

During his trial, Mikhailov declared that his conduct was caused by a desire to improve the condition of the working classes. Mikhailov admitted membership in what he called &quot;The Russian Social-Revolutionary Party&quot;, but he did not plead guilty to participating in the assassination of the Emperor. On 29 March, Mikhailov and the five other defendants were found guilty, and they were sentenced to be hanged. Mikhailov petitioned for mercy, but it was disallowed since no extenuating circumstances could be found given the severity of the case.

==Execution==
The execution took place on the morning of 15 April, in the parade grounds of the Semenovsky Regiment. The night before the execution, Mikhailov wrote a letter to his parents in the Smolensk province. That evening the Church offered its ministrations and Mikhailov made his confession.

Mikhailov was transported to the Semenovsky Regiment seated in a cart with Sophia Perovskaya and Nikolai Kibalchich. On the way, he kept bowing to people, as was customary for convicts on their way to the gallows. He shouted something several times, but according to eye-witnesses, his exact words were drowned out by the drummers of the escorting convoy.

Reportedly, during the proceedings, Mikhailov showed firmness and resignation. He and Zhelyabov approached Perovskaya and said goodbye to her with a kiss. The drums and fifes then began playing. Mikhailov was the second to be executed. Twice the rope broke under his heavy weight. First time, when the stool was pulled from under his feet, the rope broke and he crashed to the floor of the scaffold, bound and blindfolded. Mikhailov rose to his feet almost immediately, and, unaided, placed himself under the next rope. To reduce the sudden strain on the rope, Mikhailov raised his feet before the support was drawn from under him. He hung for approximately 1.5 minutes until the rope broke again. Although conscious, he was unable to rise on his own; he had to be lifted up in the arms of soldiers who would then let him drop from a fresh noose. It was reported that the crowd was at this time buzzing with indignation; some were saying that it was a sign from heaven that the criminal should be pardoned. He was finally hanged using a reinforced rope.

The body of Mikhailov and those of his companions were placed in black wooden coffins and were taken away by two carts under an escort of Cossacks. They were buried in a common grave in a remote part of the suburbs of the city.

<text>SUNET is the Swedish University Computer Network. SUNET provides high-speed Internet access to academic institutions in Sweden. The current incarnation of the network, Sunet C, provides 100 Gbit/s links between the cities hosting universities. It replaces the older network, OptoSunet, based mainly on 10 and 40 Gbit/s links. SUNET&#x27;s upstream network is the Nordic NORDUnet. SUNET is governed by a board appointed by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). In addition to the board there is a technical reference group and a development group, as well as people working at the participating universities.

SUNET did operate one of Sweden&#x27;s largest FTP archives, mirroring extensive useful material of &#x27;academic&#x27; interest, similar to the UK Mirror Service hosted by the University of Kent.
The service ftp.sunet.se is now hosted by Academic Computer Club at Umeå university.
Before the service was down sized and control of the domain was handed over to ACC, the service could handle more than 10,000 concurrent users.

SUNET, together with Sprint and TeliaSonera, took part in a 40 Gbit/s transmission on a single wavelength between Luleå, Sweden and New York City using TAT-14.

<text>John Desmond Bernal (; 10 May 1901 – 15 September 1971) was an Irish scientist who pioneered the use of X-ray crystallography in molecular biology. He published extensively on the history of science. In addition, Bernal wrote popular books on science and society. He was a communist activist and a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).

==Education and early life==
His family was Irish, with a mix of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Sephardic Jewish on his father&#x27;s side (his grandfather Jacob Genese, properly Ginesi, had adopted the family name Bernal of his paternal grandmother around 1837). His father Samuel Bernal had been raised as a Catholic in Limerick and after graduating from Albert Agricultural College spent 14 years in Australia before returning to County Tipperary to buy a farm, &quot;Brookwatson&quot;, near Nenagh where Bernal was brought up. His American mother, née Elizabeth Miller, whose mother was from Antrim, was a graduate of Stanford University and a journalist and had converted to Catholicism. Elizabeth was raised Protestant and would send John to a Protestant school in his youth.

Bernal was educated in England first for one term at Stonyhurst College, which he hated and so was moved to Bedford School at the age of 13. A pupil at the school from 1914 to 1919, according to Goldsmith he found it &quot;extremely unpleasant&quot; and most of his fellow students &quot;bored him&quot;, but his younger brother Kevin, who was also there, was &quot;some consolation&quot;, while Brown claims that &quot;he seemed to adjust easily to life&quot; there. In 1919, he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, with a scholarship.

At Cambridge, Bernal read both mathematics and science for a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1922, which he followed by another year of natural sciences. He taught himself the theory of space groups, including the quaternion method, which became the mathematical basis of a lengthy paper on crystal structure for which he won a joint prize with Ronald G.W. Norrish in his third year. At Cambridge, he also became known as &quot;Sage&quot;, a nickname given to him about 1920 by a young woman working in Charles Kay Ogden&#x27;s Bookshop at the corner of Bridge Street.

==Career and research==
After his graduation, Bernal began research under William Henry Bragg at the Davy Faraday Laboratory at the Royal Institution in London. In 1924 he determined the structure of graphite (the Bernal stacking describes the registry of two graphite planes) and also did work on the crystal structure of bronze. His strength was in analysis as much as experimental method, and his mathematical and practical treatment of determining crystal structure was widely studied, but he also developed an X-ray spectro-goniometer.

In 1927, he was appointed as the first lecturer in Structural Crystallography at Cambridge, becoming the assistant director of the Cavendish Laboratory in 1934. There, he started applying his crystallographic techniques to organic molecules, starting with oestrin and sterol compounds including cholesterol in 1929, forcing a radical change of thinking among sterol chemists. While at Cambridge, he analysed vitamin B1 (1933), pepsin (1934), vitamin D2 (1935), the sterols (1936) and the tobacco mosaic virus (1937).

He also worked on the structure of liquid water, showing the boomerang shape of its molecule (1933). It was in Bernal&#x27;s research group that after a year working with Tiny Powell at Oxford, Dorothy Hodgkin continued her early research career. Together, in 1934, they took the first X-ray photographs of hydrated protein crystals using the trick of bathing the crystals in their mother liquor, giving one of the first glimpses of the world of molecular structure that underlies living things. Max Perutz arrived as a student from Vienna in 1936 and started the work on haemoglobin that would occupy him most of his career.

However, Bernal was refused fellowships at Emmanuel and Christ&#x27;s and tenure by Ernest Rutherford, who disliked him, and in 1937, Bernal became Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, University of London, a department that had been brought to the first rank by Patrick Blackett. The same year, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. After World War II, he established Birkbeck&#x27;s Biomolecular Research Laboratory in two Georgian houses in Torrington Square with 15 researchers. It was there that Aaron Klug and Rosalind Franklin worked on tobacco mosaic virus, and Andrew Donald Booth developed some of the earliest computers to help with the computation.

His Guthrie lecture of 1947 concentrated on proteins as the basis of life, but it was Max Perutz, still at Cambridge, who developed the X-ray structural analysis of globular proteins in Britain. In the early 1960s, Bernal returned to the subject of the origin of life, analysing meteorites for evidence of complex molecules, and to the topic of the structure of liquids, which he talked about in his Bakerian lecture in 1962.

===Ministry of Home Security===
In the early 1930s, Bernal had been arguing for peace, but that changed after the Spanish Civil War started. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Bernal joined the Ministry of Home Security, where he brought in Solly Zuckerman to carry out the first proper analyses of the effects of enemy bombing and of explosions on animals and people. Their subsequent analysis of the effects of bombs on Birmingham and Kingston upon Hull showed that city bombing produced little disruption and production was affected only by direct hits on factories. A supper for scientists organised by the Tots and Quots in Soho generated a multi-author book &quot;Science in War&quot; produced in a month by Allen Lane, one of the guests, arguing that science should be applied in every part of the war effort.

From 1942, he and Zuckerman served as scientific advisers to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Chief of Combined Operations. Bernal was able to argue on both sides of Project Habbakuk, Geoffrey Pyke&#x27;s proposal to build huge aircraft landing platforms in the North Atlantic made of ice. He rescued Max Perutz from internment, getting him to perform experiments on ice related to Habbakuk in a meat store freezer below Smithfield Meat Market. This project indirectly marked his divergence from Zuckerman, when he was recalled from a joint tour of the Middle East investigating the co-operation of army and air force, but the tour established Zuckerman&#x27;s reputation as a military scientist.

===Operation Overlord and D-Day===
After the disaster of the Dieppe raid, Bernal was determined that its mistakes not be repeated in Operation Overlord. He demonstrated the advantages of an artificial harbour to the participants of the Quebec Conference in 1943, as the only British scientist present. On 3 June 1944, he was commissioned a temporary lieutenant (Special Branch) in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). His main contribution to the Normandy landings was the detailed mapping of the beaches, which had to be done without attracting any German attention. His knowledge of the area stemmed from research in English libraries, personal experience (he had visited Arromanches on previous holidays) and aerial surveys.

At Bernal&#x27;s memorial service, Zuckerman downplayed Bernal&#x27;s part in the Normandy landings and said that he was not cleared for the highest levels of security. Given Bernal&#x27;s Marxist and pro-Soviet sympathies, it is perhaps remarkable that there has never been any suggestion that he fed any information in that direction. However, Brown provides evidence of Bernal&#x27;s contributions to the preparation and the success of the invasion.

After assisting in the preparations for D-Day with work on the structure of the proposed landing sites and the bocage countryside beyond, Bernal landed, according to C. P. Snow, at Normandy on the afternoon of D-Day+1 in the uniform of an Instructor-Lieutenant Royal Navy to record the effectiveness of the plans. He also assisted boats floundering on the rocks by using his knowledge of the area but said, &quot;I committed the frightful solecism of not knowing which was port and which side was starboard&quot;.

===Publications===
Bernal&#x27;s 1929 work &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; has been called &quot;the most brilliant attempt at scientific prediction ever made&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke. It is famous for having been the first to propose the so-called Bernal sphere, a type of space habitat intended for permanent residence. The second chapter explores radical changes to human bodies and intelligence and the third discusses the impact of these on society.

In &quot;The Social Function of Science&quot; (1939) he argued that science was not an individual pursuit of abstract knowledge and that the support of research and development should be dramatically increased. Eugene Garfield, originator of the Science Citation Index, said &quot;his idea of a centralized reprint center was in my thoughts when I first proposed the as yet nonexistent SCI in Science in 1955.&quot;

&quot;Science in History&quot; (1954) is a monumental four-volume attempt to analyse the interaction between science and society. &quot;The Origin of Life&quot; (1967) gives the current ideas from Oparin and Haldane onwards.

===Political activism===
Raised as a Catholic, Bernal became a socialist in Cambridge as a result of a long night arguing with a friend. He also became an atheist. According to one reviewer, &quot;This conversion, as complete as St. Paul&#x27;s on the road to Damascus, goes some way to account for, but not excuse, Bernal&#x27;s blind allegiance for the rest of his life, to the Soviet Union&quot;. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1923. His membership evidently lapsed when he returned to Cambridge in 1927 and was not renewed until 1933, and he may have lost his card again shortly afterward.

Bernal became a prominent intellectual in political life, particularly in the 1930s. He attended the famous 1931 meeting on the history of science, where he met the Soviets Nikolai Bukharin, and Boris Hessen who gave an influential Marxist account of the work of Isaac Newton. That meeting fundamentally changed his world view and he maintained sympathy for the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin. In 1939, Bernal published &quot;The Social Function of Science&quot;, probably the earliest text on the sociology of science.

After World War II, although Bernal had been involved in evaluating the effects of atomic attacks against the Soviet Union, he supported the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace organised in Communist Poland in 1948. Afterwards, he wrote a letter to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; warning that the US was preparing &quot;a war for complete world domination&quot;. Consequently, when Bernal was invited to a world peace conference in New York in February 1949, his visa was refused. However, he was allowed into France in April for the World Congress of the Partisans of Peace, with Frédéric Joliot-Curie as president and Bernal as vice-president. The following year the organisation changed its name to the World Peace Council.

On 20 September 1949, after his return from giving a speech strongly critical of Western countries at a peace conference in Moscow, the &quot;Evening Star&quot; newspaper of Ipswich published an interview with Bernal in which he endorsed Soviet agriculture and the &quot;proletarian science&quot; of Trofim Lysenko. The Lysenko affair had erupted in August 1948, when Stalin authorised Lysenko&#x27;s theory of plant genetics as official Soviet orthodoxy, and he refused any deviation. Bernal and the whole British scientific left were damaged by his support for Lysenko&#x27;s theory, even after many scientists had abandoned their sympathy for the Soviet Union.

Under pressure from the burgeoning Cold War, the president of British Royal Society had resigned from the Soviet Academy of Sciences in November 1948. In November 1949, the British Association for the Advancement of Science removed Bernal from membership of its council. Membership in British radical science groups quickly declined. Unlike some of his socialist colleagues, Bernal persisted in defending the Soviet position on Lysenko. He publicly refused to accept the gaping fissures that the dispute revealed between the study of natural science and dialectical materialism.

In November 1950, Pablo Picasso, a fellow communist, en route to a Soviet-sponsored World Peace Congress in Sheffield created a mural in Bernal&#x27;s flat at the top of No. 22 Torrington Square. In 2007, it became part of the Wellcome Trust&#x27;s collection for £250,000.

Throughout the 1950s, Bernal maintained a faith in the Soviet Union as a vehicle for the creation of a socialist scientific utopia. In 1953, he was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. From 1959 to 1965, he was president of the World Peace Council.

===Awards and honours===
Bernal was awarded the Royal Medal in 1945, the Guthrie lecture in 1947, the Stalin Peace Prize in 1953, the Grotius Gold Medal in 1959 and the Bakerian Lecture in 1962.

Bernal was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1937. A fictional portrait of Bernal appears in the novel &quot;The Search&quot;, an early work of his friend C. P. Snow. He was also said to be the inspiration for the character Tengal in &quot;The Holiday&quot; by Stevie Smith. The Bernal Lecture and its successor the Wilkins-Bernal-Medawar Lecture Medal and Lecture were named in his honour.

===Legacy===
The Bernal Building at the University of Limerick was named in his honour. He is the eponym of the John Desmond Bernal Prize.

Bernal&#x27;s brass microscope, in the possession of his great-grandson, was restored in an episode of the BBC Television series &quot;The Repair Shop&quot; shown in April 2023.

==Personal life==
Bernal had two children – Mike (1926–2016) and Egan (b.1930) – with his wife Agnes Eileen Sprague (1898–1990), a secretary, who was usually referred to as Eileen. He married Sprague on 21 June 1922, the day after having been awarded his BA degree. Bernal was 21, Sprague 23. Sprague was described as an active socialist and their marriage as &#x27;open&#x27; which they both lived up to &#x27;with great gusto&#x27;.

In the early 1930s he had a brief intimate relationship with chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, whose scientific research work he mentored. He had a long-term relationship with the artists&#x27; patron Margaret Gardiner. Their son Martin Bernal (1937–2013) was a professor in the Department of Government at Cornell University and author of the controversial &quot;Black Athena&quot;. Margaret referred to herself as &quot;Mrs. Bernal&quot;, though the two never married. Eileen is mentioned as his widow in 1990.

He also had a child (Jane, born 1953) with Margot Heinemann.

<text>The National Park of American Samoa is a national park of the United States located in the territory of American Samoa, distributed across three islands: Tutuila, Ofu, and Taʻū. The park preserves and protects coral reefs, tropical rainforests, fruit bats, and the Samoan culture. Popular activities include hiking and snorkeling. Of the park&#x27;s , is coral reefs and ocean. The park is the only American National Park Service system unit south of the equator.

== History ==
Delegate Fofō Iosefa Fiti Sunia introduced a bill in 1984, at the request from Bat Preservers Association and Dr. Paul Cox, to include American Samoa in the Federal Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. The purpose of the bill was to protect the habitat for the flying fox as well as to protect the old rainforest. The bill marked the beginning of American Samoa&#x27;s entry into the U.S. National Park System. The National Park Service began the work of establishing the national park in July 1987.

The National Park of American Samoa was established on October 31, 1988, by Public Law 100-571 but the NPS could not buy the land because of traditional communal land system. This was resolved on September 10, 1993, when the National Park Service entered into a 50-year lease for the park land from the Samoan village councils. In 2002, Congress approved a thirty percent expansion on Olosega and Ofu islands.

In September 2009 an earthquake and tsunami produced several large waves, resulting in 34 confirmed deaths, more than a hundred injuries and the destruction of about 200 homes and businesses. The park encountered major damage. The visitor center and main office were destroyed but there was only one reported injury among the NPS staff and volunteers.

==Tutuila==

The Tutuila unit of the park is on the north end of the island near Pago Pago. It is separated by Mount Alava () and the Maugaloa Ridge and includes the Amalau Valley, Craggy Point, Tāfeu Cove, and the islands of Pola and Manofā. It consists of 2,500 acres of land (3.9 square miles) and 1,200 acres of offshore waters.

It is the only part of the park accessible by car and attracts the vast majority of visitors to the area. The park lands include a trail to the top of Mount Alava and historic World War II gun emplacement sites at Breakers Point and Blunts Point. The trail runs along the ridge in dense forest, north of which the land slopes steeply away to the ocean.

==Manuʻa Islands==
===Ofu===

Consisting of the two-mile Ofu Beach and Sunuitao Peak, the Ofu unit is the smallest of the three park units (70 acres of land, 400 acres of offshore waters), although most of the visitors who have been there consider it the most attractive. 
Ofu island is accessible via small fisherman boats from Taʻū island, which are not very reliable transportation, and from biweekly flights from Pago Pago. Accommodations are available on Ofu.

===Taʻū===
With 3,700 acres (21 square kilometers, 8.3 square miles) of land and 1,100 acres of offshore waters, the Taʻū unit is the largest and the most wild of the three park units, and also include the highest point in American Samoa, Lata Mountain .
Taʻū island can be reached by a flight from Tutuila to Fiti‘uta village on Taʻū. Accommodations are available on Taʻū. A trail runs from Saua around Siʻu Point to the southern coastline. There used to be a trail to the summit of Lata Mountain, but it has become overgrown and impassable without machete work. There is a report that the National Park Service plans to rebuild the trail starting in June 2024.

==Biodiversity==
Because of its remote location, diversity among the terrestrial species is low. Approximately 30% of the plants and one bird species (the Samoan starling) are endemic to the archipelago.

===Fauna===

Three species of bat are the only native mammals: two large fruit bats (Samoa flying fox and white-naped flying fox) and a small insectivore, the Pacific sheath-tailed bat. They serve an important role in pollinating the island&#x27;s plants. The sheath-tailed bat was nearly eliminated by Cyclone Val in 1991 and possibly became locally extinct some time afterwards. Four reptiles are known to be native to the island: the Oceania gecko, and three species of skinks (mottled snake-eyed skink (&quot;Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus&quot;), Micronesian skink (&quot;Emoia adspersa&quot;), and olive small-scaled skink (&quot;Emoia lawesii&quot;)). Additionally, there are 8 reptiles introduced with Polynesian settlement: five skink species (copper-tailed skink (&quot;Emoia cyanura&quot;), azure-tailed skink (&quot;Emoia impar&quot;), black emo skink (&quot;Emoia nigra&quot;), Samoa skink (&quot;Emoia samoensis&quot;), and moth skink (&quot;Ornithuroscincus noctua&quot;)), two gecko species (Pacific slender-toed gecko (&quot;Nactus pelagicus&quot;) and mourning gecko) and the Pacific boa (currently only found on Taʻū).

There are three reptiles introduced in the modern (post 18th century) era: stump-toed gecko, common house gecko, and the Brahminy blind snake (only on Tutuila).

Among mammals, Polynesian rats, pigs, and dogs are Polynesian introductions, while cats, black rats, brown rats, and house mouses are modern introductions. Also, the only known amphibian on the island, the cane toad is also a modern introduction, but is only found on Tutuila.

There are several bird species, the most predominant being the wattled honeyeater, Samoan starling, and Pacific pigeon. Other unusual birds include the Tahiti petrel, the spotless crake, and the rare (in this locality) many-colored fruit dove.

A major role for the park is to control and eradicate invasive plant and animal species such as feral pigs, which threaten the park&#x27;s ecosystem.

===Flora===
The islands are mostly covered by tropical rainforest, including cloud forest on Taʻū and lowland ridge forest on Tutuila. Most plants arrived by chance from Southeast Asia. There are 343 flowering plants, 135 ferns and about 30% are endemic plant species.

===Marine===
The surrounding waters are filled with a diversity of marine life, including sea turtles, humpback whales, over 950 species of fish, and over 250 coral species. Some of the largest living coral colonies (Porites) in the world are at Taʻū island.

==Geology==

The volcanic islands of Samoa that dominate the acreage of the national park are composed of shield volcanoes which developed from a hot spot on the Pacific Plate, emerging sequentially from west to east. Tutulia, the largest and oldest island, probably dates from the Pliocene Epoch, approximately 1.24 to 1.4 million years ago, while the smaller islands are most likely Holocene in age.

The islands are not made up of individual volcanoes, but are rather composed of overlapping and superimposed shield volcanoes built by basalt lava flows. Much of the lava that erupted has since broken into angular fragments known as breccia. The volcanoes emerged from the intrusion of basaltic dikes from a rift zone on the ocean floor during the Pliocene Epoch, and were heavily eroded during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene Epochs, leaving behind trachyte plugs and exposed outcrops of volcanic tuff throughout the park. Taʻū island, the youngest of the islands included within the national park, is all that remains from the collapse of a shield volcano during Holocene time. This collapse produced sea cliffs over 3,000 feet high on the north side of the island, some of the highest such escarpments in the world.

While the Samoan islands have not shown evidence of volcanism for many years, the Samoa hotspot beneath the islands continues to give indications of activity, with a submarine eruption detected just east of American Samoa in 1973. The Vailulu&#x27;u Seamount, located east of Taʻū, is a future Samoan island developing from submarine lava flows, continuing the eastward progress of volcanic development from the hotspot below the islands. The lava flows forming the seamount have been dated by radiometric methods to between 5 and 50 years, during which time the seamount has risen 14,764 feet from the ocean floor.

Evidence exists of past submarine and surface landslides as a result of weathering and other forms of erosion of the rocks and soil making up the islands. On Taʻū island, an inland escarpment known as Liu Bench (a feature of mass wasting) threatens to slump into the nearby ocean, an event which could produce a tsunami strong enough to bring devastation to the islands of Fiji to the southeast.

Olivine basalts were extruded from a N. 70° E. trending rift zone, oriented along the current Afono and Masefay bays of Tutuila, in the Pliocene or earliest Pleistocene. The Masefau dike complex and talus breccias are remnants of this rifting. Development of the Taputapu, Pago, Alofau, and Olomoana shield domes followed long parallel fissures followed, but when the Pago and Alofau summits collapsed, calderas were formed. Thick tuffs were deposited in the Pago caldera, and the southern rim was buried by lavas composed of picritic basalts, andesites, and trachytes. Subsequent erosion in Early to Middle Pleistocene enlarged the calderas, the Pago River in particular carved a deep canyon, the forerunner of today&#x27;s Pago Pago Bay. A submarine shelf formed from the erosional runoff, allowing for the development of coral reefs before the island was submerged to . Sea level fluctuations continued in the Middle to Late Pleistocene. A barrier reef formed, was submerged , before emerging , leaving sea caves above sea level. Leone volcanics erupted in recent time generating tuff cones undersea, such as Aunuu Island, and cinder cones on land. The pahoehoe flows buried the submerged barrier reef, enlarging the island by . The island has since emerged another .

Ofu and Olosega are the remains of a single basaltic volcano, north to south and east to west, which formed in the Pliocene to Early Pleistocene. Remnants of one half of the caldera, ponded flows, form the north center portion of Ofu. The steepest cliffs, high, are found on this north coast. The Ofu-Olosega island group formed along the same N. 70° W. trending rift which formed Taʻū, another single basaltic dome. The remnant of Taʻū&#x27;s caldera is found on the south coast. A cliff marks the north coast of this island.

Upolu formed as an elongated basaltic shield volcano due to Late Tertiary to Late Pliocene rifting along a S. 70° E. trend. Remnants of these eruptions are found as inliers and monadnocks forming Mt. Tafatafao, Mt. Vaaifetu, and Mt. Spitzer. Volcanic activity renewed in the Middle Pleistocene along the same rift trend, with olivine basalt pahoehoe and aa flowing northward and southward from a point west from the center of the island. Pleistocene cinder cones trending east and west, are aligned along the center axis of the island. Savai&#x27;i lies along this same rift trend, its surface marked by Quaternary lava flows. Examples include the olivine basalt pahoehoe which emerged from Mount Matavanu from 1905 to 1911, and the Mauga Afi chain of spatter cones of 1902.

==Threats==
The coral reefs are under significant threat due to rising ocean temperatures and carbon dioxide concentration, as well as sea level rise. As a result of these and other stresses, the corals that form the reefs are projected to be lost by mid-century if carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at their current rate.

==2020 American Samoa quarter==

In 2018, the U.S. Mint had several candidate designs developed for the 2020 National Park of American Samoa quarter for the America the Beautiful series. One of the designs features the familiar image of George Washington by John Flanagan, used on the quarter (heads) since 1932. The (tails) of the quarter features a Samoan fruit bat mother hanging in a tree with her pup. The image represents the remarkable care and energy that this species puts into their offspring. This design is intended to promote awareness to the threatened status of this species due to habitat loss and commercial hunting. The bats on the coins were designed by Richard Alan Masters, who worked as Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh&#x27;s Department of Art. The designs were selected by the Citizen&#x27;s Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) and the Commission on Fine Art (CFA). The coin was released to the public in February 2020.

<text>Didymium () is a mixture of the elements praseodymium and neodymium. It is used in safety glasses for glassblowing and blacksmithing and filter lenses for flame testing, especially with a gas (propane)-powered forge, where it provides a filter that selectively blocks the yellowish light at 589 nm emitted by the hot sodium in the glass without having a detrimental effect on general vision, unlike dark welder&#x27;s glasses and cobalt glasses. The usefulness of didymium glass for eye protection of this sort was discovered by Sir William Crookes.

Didymium photographic filters are often used to enhance autumn scenery by making leaves appear more vibrant. It does this by removing part of the orange region of the color spectrum, acting as an optical band-stop filter. Unfiltered, this group of colors tends to make certain elements of a picture appear &quot;muddy&quot;. These photographic filters are also used by nightscape photographers, as they absorb part of the light pollution caused by sodium street lights. Didymium was also used in the sodium vapor process for matte work due to its ability to absorb the yellow color produced by its eponymous sodium lighting.

Didymium is also used in calibration materials for spectroscopy.

==Discovery==

Didymium was discovered by Carl Mosander in 1841. It was named after the Greek word (&quot;twin&quot;) because it is very similar to lanthanum and cerium, with which it was found. Mosander wrongly believed didymium to be an element and that cerite, isolated by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1803, was a mixture of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium. Cerium, lanthanum, and didymium made up least 95% of the rare earths in the original cerite from Bastnäs, Sweden.

In trivalent form, didymium tinged the salts of ceria pink. During the time that didymium was believed to be an element, the symbol Di was used for it. In Dmitri Mendeleev&#x27;s first attempt at a periodic table, the atomic weights assigned to the lanthanides (including didymium) reflect the original belief that they were divalent. Their actual oxidation number of 3 implies that Mendeleev underestimated atomic weights for them by one third.

In 1874, Per Teodor Cleve deduced that didymium was made up of at least two elements. In 1879, Lecoq de Boisbaudran succeeded in isolating a samarium compound for the first time; the compound was isolated from didymium contained in North Carolinian samarskite. In 1885, Carl Auer von Welsbach succeeded in separating salts of the last two component elements, praseodymium and neodymium. To accomplish this, he used a fractional crystallization of the double ammonium nitrates from a solution of nitric acid.

Welsbach had decided to name his two new elements &quot;praseodidymium&quot; (&quot;green didymium&quot;) and &quot;neodidymium&quot; (&quot;new didymium&quot;), but one syllable was soon dropped from each name. Despite being abbreviated in the new elements&#x27; names, the untruncated name &quot;didymium&quot; persisted, partly due to its use as an ingredient in glassblowers&#x27; goggles, and colored glass. The name &quot;didymium&quot; also was retained in mineralogical texts.

==Glassmaking==
During World War I, didymium mirrors were reportedly used to transmit Morse Code across battlefields. Didymium does not absorb enough light to make the variation in lamp&#x27;s light output obvious, but someone with binoculars attached to a prism in the correct fashion could see the absorption bands flash on and off.

In the late 1920s, Leo Moser (Moser glass-works Director General, 1916 to 1932) recombined praseodymium and neodymium in a 1:1 ratio to create his &quot;Heliolite&quot; glass (&quot;Heliolit&quot; in Czech), which has color-changing properties between amber, reddish, and green depending on the light source. This was one of a number of decorative glasses using rare earth colorants, with &quot;Heliolit&quot; and &quot;Alexandrit&quot; being the first two, introduced by Moser in 1929. Leo Moser&#x27;s papers in the Corning Glass Museum make it clear that the first experimental glass melts done by Moser involving any of the rare earths occurred in November 1927.

After a year of further development, the rare earth glasses were introduced to great acclaim at the Spring 1929 trade show in Leipzig. The Alexandrit and Heliolit names were registered as trademarks in June 1929. The earlier date of 1925 sometimes given for rare earth glass refers to an award for glass design, not glass composition.

==Industrial use==
The name &quot;didymium&quot; continued to be used in the rare earth metal industry. In the US, commercial &quot;didymium&quot; salts were what remained after cerium had been removed from the natural products obtained from monazite, and thus it contained lanthanum, as well as Mosander&#x27;s &quot;didymium&quot;. A typical composition might have been 46% lanthanum, 34% neodymium, and 11% praseodymium, with the remainder mostly being samarium and gadolinium, for material extracted from South African &quot;rock monazite&quot; from the Steenkampskraal mine.

In ores, neodymium is typically higher in relative abundance in monazite than in bastnäsite. The visual difference is apparent in unseparated mixtures: monazite-derived products have pink tinges, while bastnäsite-derived products have brown tinges due to their higher praseodymium content. The original cerite from Bastnäs may have had a rare earth composition similar to monazite sand.

The European use was closer to Mosander&#x27;s concept. Such cerium-depleted light lanthanide mixtures have been widely used to make petroleum-cracking catalysts. The actual ratio of neodymium to praseodymium varies somewhat depending on the source of the mineral, but it is often around . Neodymium is always present in higher proportions than praseodymium and is responsible for most of the color of didymium salts.

<text>Tony Orlando and Dawn (also known simply as Dawn) is an American pop music group that was popular in the 1970s, composed of singer Tony Orlando and the backing vocal group Dawn (Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson). Their signature hits include &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Knock Three Times&quot;, &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;, &quot;Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose&quot;, and &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You (Like I Love You)&quot;.

== Early history ==

Tony Orlando was born Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis on April 3, 1944. Orlando recorded through the 1960s with only moderate chart success. He had three Top 40 hits, two in 1961 and another in 1969 as the lead singer for the studio group Wind. While recording through the 1960s, he also became a producer and a successful music executive with Columbia Records and April/Blackwood music.

While working as a music executive, Orlando received &quot;Candida&quot;, a song other producers and singers had turned down. Originally, Orlando could not lend his name to the song, as he was working for April-Blackwood and recording under his name would be a professional conflict of interest. After producer Hank Medress insisted Orlando dub his voice over the male vocals on the original track, Bell Records released the single as being performed by the band &quot;Dawn&quot; to protect Orlando&#x27;s position. On the American Top 40 radio episode for the week ending October 3, 1970, host Casey Kasem stated that the lead singer of Dawn was Frankie Spinelli; obviously this alias was used to further obscure Tony Orlando&#x27;s true identity as the lead singer on Candida. A few weeks later on the American Top 40 episode for the week ending October 31, 1970, Casey Kasem stated that four guys make up Dawn: Frank, Ricky, Jim, and Dave.

The background singers on the track were Cynthia Weil, Linda November, Jay Siegel, and Toni Wine, who co-wrote the song. Phil Margo played drums on the original session, and the arranger was Norman Bergen. After the single hit No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (No.1 on the Cashbox Top 100), Orlando wanted to perform again. The ensemble recorded the 1970 album &quot;Candida&quot;, which included the namesake song and the No. 1 hit song &quot;Knock Three Times&quot;. On the American Top 40 radio episode for the week ending January 23, 1971, Kasem identified Dawn as an eight-member group from Philadelphia, far from the truth about the musicians on the record.

Bell Records was desperate to have a real-life act to promote Dawn&#x27;s records. Orlando asked former Motown/Stax backing vocalists Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson, whom he had hired to work as background vocalists while producing Barry Manilow in the late 1960s, to become Dawn. The threesome then went on the road in 1971, on the success of &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Knock Three Times&quot;. After a tour of Europe, Hopkins and Vincent assumed background vocal duties in the studio, first recording on the late 1971 album &quot;Dawn Featuring Tony Orlando&quot;. The first single with their voices in the background was &quot;Runaway/Happy Together&quot; in 1972.

The group (now billed as &#x27;Dawn featuring Tony Orlando&#x27;) released another single in 1973, and it became their next No. 1 single — &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon &#x27;Round the Ole Oak Tree.&quot; In terms of sales, this single was the most successful in the group&#x27;s career, starting a string of eleven consecutive Hot 100 appearances by the group.

On &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in 1975, Harvey Korman, Carol Burnett, and Vicki Lawrence performed a spoof of Tony Orlando and Dawn, as Tony Tallahassee and Dusk, singing &quot;Wrap Your Jammies Round the Old White Pine&quot;. At the end of the number, they were kicked off the stage by the real Tony Orlando and Dawn. Earlier, Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia&quot; had immediately preceded Dawn&#x27;s &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot; at the top position of the Hot 100 in April 1973.

== Period of group&#x27;s variety show ==
The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose&quot; (from their concept album &quot;Dawn&#x27;s New Ragtime Follies&quot;), went to No. 3 on the Hot 100, followed by Top 40 hits &quot;Who&#x27;s In The Strawberry Patch With Sally&quot; (the first single with recording credit &quot;Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn&quot;) (No. 27), &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out (Gonna Boogie Tonight)&quot; (No.7), and, with some disco influence, Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter&#x27;s &quot;Look in My Eyes Pretty Woman&quot; (from the trio&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Prime Time&quot;) (No.11).

CBS gave the group a television variety show (entitled &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;) from the summer of 1974, after &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; ended its run, until December 1976. The show was in the same vein as its predecessor (with sketches featuring sarcastic back-and-forth banter between Orlando, Hopkins and Vincent, similar to the sarcastic dialogue between Sonny and Cher) and became a Top 20 hit.

With a new record label (Elektra), the group continued their string of hit singles during the show&#x27;s run, hitting #1 on both the Hot 100 and the adult contemporary charts with &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You (Like I Love You)&quot; (a reworking of Jerry Butler&#x27;s &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;), from the album of the same name, and &quot;Mornin&#x27; Beautiful&quot; (#14). In 1975 &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, followed in 1976 by &quot;Cupid&quot;, both from their final original album &quot;To Be with You&quot;, became the group&#x27;s last two Top 40 singles on the Hot 100. &quot;Sing&quot; reached No. 7 on the Adult Contemporary Chart in 1977. The group went their separate ways later that year and would have only one more single, 1991&#x27;s &quot;With Ev&#x27;ry Yellow Ribbon (That&#x27;s Why We Tie &#x27;Em)&quot;.

== Later career ==
They re-formed in 1988 for a five-week tour that wound up lasting into 1993, with Vincent&#x27;s sister Pamela Vincent stepping in whenever Hopkins was fulfilling her acting/television obligations.

Orlando is still a popular appearance performer on tour regularly with the Lefty Brothers and Toni Wine. Hopkins made a very successful acting career for herself in series such as &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;, &quot;Gimme a Break&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Half and Half&quot;, and &quot;Are We There Yet&quot;.

The Vincent Sisters continue a prolific career as session singers. A DVD compilation from the variety series was released in 2005 along with the group&#x27;s catalog of albums on CD. Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn released &quot;A Christmas Reunion&quot; that same year. Publicity events for those releases marked the first time Hopkins, and both Vincent Sisters appeared onstage together. Toni Wine also participated in those shows. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2008.

Tony Orlando and Dawn occasionally reunite for television and benefit performances. In 2009, Joyce Vincent joined Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence&#x27;s Former Ladies of the Supremes&#x27; group. She continues to tour and perform to audiences all over the world. Tony Orlando, Telma Hopkins, and Joyce Vincent reunited again in 2015 for the sold-out &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn: To Be with You Again&quot; tour and appeared at Chiller Theatre in Parsippany, NJ, and again for a successful Christmas tour in late-2018. Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent joined Tony Orlando on stage at his final (retirement) concert on March 22, 2024 at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut.

<text>Bartley Reservoir is a reservoir for drinking water in Birmingham, England, operated by Severn Trent Water. It covers .

The reservoir is about long, over wide, and about deep at the dam. Its surface area is .

It is known as the place where Bill Oddie did much of his early birdwatching, and features in his books (notably &quot;Bill Oddie&#x27;s Gone Birding&quot;) and television programmes. His first ever published article, for the West Midland Bird Club&#x27;s annual report, was about the birds of the reservoir. The reservoir is also home to Bartley Sailing Club and Andrew Simpson Centres Birmingham. 

==History==
Most of the land occupied by Bartley Reservoir was in the parish of Northfield, originally in Worcestershire. It was transferred to Warwickshire when Northfield became part of Birmingham in November 1911, and thus became part of the West Midlands county on the latter&#x27;s creation in 1974.

However, the south-west end of the reservoir overlapped into the parish of Frankley, in Worcestershire (Hereford and Worcester, from 1974). In April 1995 part of Frankley (including the south-west part of Bartley Reservoir) was transferred to Birmingham and thus joined the rest of the reservoir in the West Midlands county.

Shortly after the completion of the Elan Valley Reservoirs in the early 1920s, it became apparent that more storage capacity would be required to maintain the daily supplies needed by Birmingham. The reservoir is close to the terminus of the Elan aqueduct and adjacent to Frankley Reservoir.

The contract for the construction of the reservoir was let by Birmingham Corporation Water Department in February 1925 to Edmund Nuttall, Sons and Co. Ltd., of Manchester, and the Francois Cementation Company undertook all cementation. It was completed in 1930.

The reservoir featured in a television programme in 1985, when Bill Oddie was interviewed there by Julian Pettifer for a 50-minute &quot;Nature Watch Special: Bill Oddie - Bird Watcher&quot;.

<doc id="758644" wikidata="Q491005" url="?curid=758644" title="Virgin Islands National Park">
<text>The Virgin Islands National Park is a national park of the United States preserving about 60% of the land area of Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as more than of adjacent ocean, and nearly all of Hassel Island, just off the Charlotte Amalie, Saint Thomas harbor.

The park is well known for scuba diving and snorkeling, and has miles of hiking trails through the tropical rainforest.

Cruz Bay is the gateway port to the park, as well as the visitor center location. Ferries operate hourly from Red Hook, St. Thomas, thrice daily from Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas and West End, Tortola, twice daily from Jost Van Dyke, and twice weekly from Virgin Gorda.

Two category 5 hurricanes impacted the Virgin Islands in September 2017, Irma and Maria. The park received 112,287 visitors in 2018, after having received 304,408 visitors in 2017, and an average of more than 450,000 visitors per year in the preceding ten-year period from 2007 to 2016. The park was reopened in December 2017 with all roads, trails and beaches declared accessible to visitors.

==Park purpose==

As stated in the foundation document:
==History==
In 1956, Laurance Rockefeller&#x27;s Jackson Hole Preserve donated its extensive lands on the island to the National Park Service, under the condition that the lands had to be protected from future development. The remaining portion, the Caneel Bay Resort, operates on a lease arrangement with the NPS, which owns the underlying land.

The boundaries of the Virgin Islands National Park include 75% of the island, but various in-holdings within the park boundary (e.g., Peter Bay, Maho Bay) reduce the park lands to 60% of the island acreage.

Much of the island&#x27;s waters, coral reefs, and shoreline have been protected by being included in the national park. This protection was expanded in 2001, when the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument was created.

In 2006, The Trust for Public Land purchased the Estate Maho Bay for preservation. The property includes beaches, undisturbed forest as well as historic Danish colonial and Taíno Indian artifacts. The trust intends to sell the property to the National Park Service as federal funds become available. In 2011, the trust donated 18 acres at Mamey&#x27;s Peak to the National Park Service. In 2012, the National Park Service purchased 58 acres from the trust for $2.25 million, using money from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund. In 2013, an additional 72 acres of the Estate Maho Bay property was sold to the National Park Service for $2.5 million, the largest addition to the park.

Hurricanes Irma and Maria, both category 5 hurricanes, impacted the Virgin Islands in September 2017. The park was reopened in December 2017 with all roads, trails and beaches declared accessible to visitors. The park received 112,287 visitors in 2018, after having received 304,408 visitors in 2017, and an average of more than 450,000 visitors per year in the preceding ten-year period from 2007 to 2016.

==Attractions==

Beaches, coral reefs, hiking trails, and natural sites are the park&#x27;s main attractions.

Visitors can stay in numerous resorts, hotels, and vacation villas near the park on St. John. Cinnamon Bay Campground is located inside the park, as is Caneel Bay Resort on the north shore which lies on Rockefeller&#x27;s former personal estate. Overnight and day use mooring balls are available to boaters.

=== Beaches ===
The beaches of Virgin Islands National Park are regularly named some of the best in the world.
Trunk Bay is a body of water and the adjacent beach on Saint John. Trunk Bay has an underwater trail for snorkeling along its coral reef. The beach area is divided into two halves, the main Trunk Bay beach and swim area, and Burgesman Cove which is located on the west end of Trunk Bay near Jumbie Bay.

Cinnamon Bay beach is a long, wide stretch of sand on the north shore of St. John. The beach is popular for sunbathing, snorkeling, and water sports. The bay is also home to the Cinnamon Bay Campground and water sports rental.
Honeymoon Beach is on the north shore of St. John and can be accessed from Cruz Bay by hiking the long Lind Point Trail or from Caneel Bay Resort. The beach features soft white sand under tall palm trees. Kayaks and snorkel equipment are available for rent.

Maho Bay is known for its soft sand and calm, shallow waters. The sand and seagrass sea floor make it a good place to see sea turtles and stingrays.

Located on St. John&#x27;s south shore, Salt Pond Bay is a protected bay and beach. The beach can be reached by hiking a short trail from Route 107, about south of Coral Bay. The bay is a popular snorkeling spot and has fringing reefs on both sides of the bay, sea grass in the center, and a deep coral reef far out in the middle of the bay. Overnight and day use mooring balls are available for boaters. From Salt Pond Bay, hikers can access Drunk Bay and Ram Head Trail.

=== Hiking ===
The Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail passes sugar plantation ruins, while the Bordeaux Mountain Trail leads to the highest point on the island at above sea level.

The Reef Bay Trail offers views of forests, remnants of sugar mills, historical Taíno petroglyph rock carvings, a spring-fed waterfall and reflection pool, as well as snorkeling over the coral reef at Genti Bay. The hike is strenuous and the round trip from Centerline Road is more than . A ranger-guided hike is offered, including a boat ride back to Cruz Bay from Reef Bay.

The Bordeaux Mountain Trail is a steep and rocky path leading from Little Lameshur Bay to the highest point of the island. The trail is unmaintained and although there are several overlooks along the way, there is no view from the top of this densely forested mountain. The trail gains almost in about .

The long Lind Point Trail begins in Cruz Bay, behind the Virgin Islands National Park Visitor Center. The trail leads up to Lind Point, overlooking Cruz Bay harbor, before continuing on to Honeymoon Beach.

Starting in Cruz Bay, just north of Mongoose Junction, the Caneel Hill Trail leads up a steep incline to the top of Caneel Hill. A wooden observation platform is at the summit with views of St. John, St. Thomas, Jost Van Dyke, and many smaller islands. On a clear day, a hiker may see St. Croix and even Puerto Rico.

Beginning at Salt Pond Bay, the Ram Head Trail travels about down a dry and rocky peninsula to the southernmost point on St. John.

Across from the entrance to Cinnamon Bay Campground, the Cinnamon Bay Nature Trail is a loop winding through the ruins of a sugar factory. Signs along the path explain the history of the area. The trail is a mixture of boardwalks and paved paths with no steep hills.

=== Historic sites ===

The park protects dozens of historic ruins from the colonial and plantation eras through the 1950s.

The Annaberg Historic District protects a partially restored sugar factory and windmill located just east of Mary&#x27;s Point. National park signage guides visitors through the ruins and explains the process of turning sugar cane into molasses. Volunteers and park rangers are frequently in the area to answer questions. The bake house hosts cooking demonstrations and offers samples of dumb bread. The windmill is located on Annaberg Point, which offers views of Tortola, Great Thatch Island, and the Narrows.

The ruins of the Reef Bay Sugar Factory Historic District can be reached via Reef Bay Trail or L&#x27;Esperance trail.

The Reef Bay Trail petroglyphs are Taíno rock carvings located on rock pools near a waterfall. They can be reached via a long spur trail from Reef Bay Trail. The petroglyph site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

The well-preserved Catherineberg Sugar Mill Ruins are among the most easily accessed in the park, and include a windmill tower and a horse mill.

==Geography==

Virgin Islands National Park encompasses of land and ocean. The park covers almost 60 percent of St. John Island, adjacent ocean, and almost all of Hassel Island.

The main features are coral reefs, which almost completely surround the park, and the ocean waters, tropical forests and beaches. 

==Wildlife==
Wild donkeys, deer, mongoose, pigs, goats, birds, iguanas, skinks, tortoises, frogs, fish, and crabs inhabit the park. Bats are the only native land mammal in the park.

The park has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of bridled quail-doves, green-throated caribs, Antillean crested hummingbirds, brown pelicans, Caribbean elaenias, Puerto Rican flycatchers, pearly-eyed thrashers and Lesser Antillean bullfinches.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Virgin Islands National Park has a tropical savanna wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;). Class &quot;A&quot; tropical climates have an average temperature of 18 °C (64.4 °F) or higher in every month of the year, with significant annual precipitation. Class &quot;Aw&quot; climates have a pronounced dry season, with the driest month having precipitation less than 60 mm (2.36 in) and less than 1/25 of the total annual precipitation.

The average rainfall per year is . In the winter, trade winds blow from to . The average temperature for the park is .

The park experiences very little temperature variation between summer and winter, while the sea is warm year-round. The main tourist season is from December to April, which are the driest months. During the remaining months (i.e., the Atlantic hurricane season), prices for accommodations are reduced considerably. Camping and rustic lodging are available in the park from November through August at Cinnamon Bay Campground. Caneel Bay Resort provides luxury accommodations along with upscale dining in the park from November through July.

==Geology==

Located at the east end of the Greater Antilles, St. John resides on the northeastern end of the Caribbean Plate. The island formed during the Cretaceous with the eruption of the Water Island Formation, consisting of keratophyres and pillow basalts. Igneous activity then changed to that of an island arc, characterized by the Louisenhoj Formation, consisting of andesite and basalt. Volcanism abated during the deposition of the Outer Brass Limestone. Volcanism resumed as evidenced by the Late Cretaceous Tutu Formation, consisting of volcaniclastic turbidites, basalt, and andesite. A diabase dike swarm followed and then compressive folding attributed to the Caribbean Plate colliding with the Bahama Platform. The Late Eocene saw the intrusion of Narrows pluton and Virgin Gorda batholith, associated with the Greater Antilles arc magmatism, and more compressive folding associated with the spreading of the Cayman Trough. This spreading is also tied to sinistral strike-slip faulting at 39 Ma.

<text>Jabberwocky is a 1977 British fantasy comedy film co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam. Jabberwocky stars Michael Palin as Dennis, a cooper&#x27;s apprentice, who is forced through clumsy, often slapstick misfortunes to hunt a terrible dragon after the death of his father. The film&#x27;s title is taken from the nonsense poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871).

The film is Gilliam&#x27;s solo directorial debut, after he co-directed &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; with Terry Jones in 1975. The film received a mixed response from critics and audiences.

==Plot==
In the depths of the Dark Ages, a carnivorous monster ravages the domains of King Bruno the Questionable. Life carries on as normal in isolated villages; in one of which, very innocent young Dennis Cooper pursues a career as a cooper in his ailing father&#x27;s workshop. Mr. Cooper, senior, despises his son for valuing profit over craftsmanship, and when his illness becomes terminal, he publicly disinherits Dennis in an abuse-ridden deathbed speech. Dennis decides to travel to the kingdom&#x27;s capital city, establish a new career, and then return to marry his love, a local woman named Griselda Fishfinger who doesn&#x27;t reciprocate his affection. While trying to say goodbye to an inattentive Griselda, she throws away a rotten potato which Dennis catches and keeps as a cherished memento.

King Bruno&#x27;s city is full of terrified refugees from villages destroyed by the monster. The only people pleased with the situation are a cabal of rich merchants selling overpriced goods to the refugees. None of the overburdened local craftsmen will listen to Dennis&#x27; suggestions for &quot;improving efficiency&quot;, and he struggles to find work or food. Meanwhile, the king has decided to send a knight against the monster, and organizes a jousting tournament to find the best warrior for the job. If successful, the knight will be promoted to prince and married to the Princess, who lives in a tower, wishing a true prince will arrive and marry her.

A man named Ethel, squire to the Knight of the Red Herring, befriends Dennis and gives him a meal. Misunderstandings ensue and Dennis finds himself fleeing from a tavern keeper whose wife Ethel seduced. He seeks refuge in the tower, where the Princess, in a great feat of wishful thinking, takes him for an adventuring prince disguised as a peasant, and takes the potato, thinking he has brought it as a love token for her. Dennis is too bewildered to explain the truth, but he does convey that he already has a lover and the Princess sorrowfully lets him go. She lends him a nun&#x27;s habit to use as a disguise, which leads to a run-in with a group of religious fanatics who believe he is Satan in the guise of a nun (or possibly a nun in the guise of Satan).

The joust grows increasingly bloody, and Passelewe, King Bruno&#x27;s chamberlain, worries that all the knights will end up killed or incapacitated. He convinces the king to call off the fighting and instead pick a champion based on the outcome of a game of hide and seek. Red Herring emerges victorious. Ethel wants to stay in the city and pursue his affair with the tavern keeper&#x27;s wife, so he bullies Dennis into taking his place as squire. The huge and dimwitted knight appears never to notice.

In order to continue profiting from the crisis the city merchants hire another warrior, the Black Knight, who rides to the monster&#x27;s lair and assassinates Red Herring. He is about to kill Dennis as well, but the monster appears—a horrific, dragon-like biped—and the Black Knight is compelled to fight for his own life. After a titanic struggle, he appears to slay the monster, but it revives and knocks him off a cliff. Dennis accidentally slays it when it impales itself on a sword he was holding while cowering, and then cuts off the monster&#x27;s head, brings it to the king, and is credited for the exploit. Griselda is more interested in Dennis now that he is a hero, but he never gets the chance to marry her. King Bruno the Questionable keeps his word, and Dennis is given half the kingdom, married to the Princess, and swept off to his honeymoon and an uncertain fate.

==Production==
The film is close in setting and comic style to &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, on which Gilliam had co-directed. In addition to Palin, Python Terry Jones and Python contributor Neil Innes appeared in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, giving it a Python-esque feel, with many scenes (such as the &quot;hide and seek&quot; jousting tournament) reminiscent of &quot;Holy Grail&quot;. For its American premiere the film was advertised as &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Jabberwocky&quot; despite protests from Gilliam.

===Filming locations===
The film was shot on location in Wales. There are two castles in the film: Pembroke Castle and Chepstow Castle. The Jabberwocky battle scenes were filmed in an old Pembroke stone quarry.

===Monster===

The Jabberwock is a man in costume similar to the classic Japanese &quot;Godzilla&quot; film effects. To recreate the illustrated monster of the 19th century storybook, the costume is designed to be worn by a man walking backwards. Hip and knee joints are reversed giving it a bird-like gait. The actor&#x27;s head is hidden within the monster&#x27;s torso – the large marionette head on a serpentine neck is controlled by an offscreen pole and lines, which are visible on the print. Long bird-like claws extend out of his shoe heels and his arms become the Jabberwock&#x27;s wings. Film speed is altered in some scenes to slow the monster&#x27;s movements and camera angles manipulate perspective in scenes with live actors to depict the monster&#x27;s immense size. Director Terry Gilliam, during the DVD commentary, stated that the Jabberwock&#x27;s &#x27;Death Fall&#x27; came about accidentally when the actor tripped during filming but because the fall was so natural it was used in the final print.

==Themes==
===Commerce===
One of the most noticeable themes in the film is that of commerce. Dennis Cooper is unable to continue his work as a cooper after being gleefully disowned by his dying father. Despite Cooper having good ideas about raising productivity, the merchants and businessmen he meets are unwilling to listen to him. He moves from his village to the enclosed town in search of business opportunity. Dennis discovers that the guilds and merchants control business and that outsiders are struggling to survive. While in the city he discovers Wat Dabney, a legendary cooper and inventor of the &quot;inverted firkin&quot;. Despite his skill, Wat is excluded by the guilds and has cut his foot off in an attempt to become a beggar – an act so successful that he ends up cutting off his other foot by the film&#x27;s end.

The top merchants in the town profit handsomely from fear of the Jabberwock and are reluctant to help the King end the crisis. The Bishop is happy that fear has led to increased donations to the church and increased attendances at mass and confession (&quot;piety ain&#x27;t never been higher!&quot;). The Bishop is so unimpressed by the King&#x27;s choice of a champion to slay the monster that he blesses the champion by simply flicking holy water at him with his index finger. The merchants conspire to send the &quot;black knight&quot; (portrayed by David Prowse in his last pre-Darth Vader role) to kill the king&#x27;s champion (also played by David Prowse) and are aghast when Dennis comes back with the monster&#x27;s head.

===&quot;Creaking bureaucracy&quot;===
King Bruno the Questionable and his aide, Passelewe are aged rulers in a castle that is falling apart. Darkness, dust, cobwebs and fallen plaster lie everywhere. It is so dark and decrepit that the town outside is refreshing in comparison. So entrenched are these two in their misrule that the only way the King can find an answer to the Jabberwock is to emulate the deeds of his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather (Max the Vainglorious) and hold a tournament to select a champion; a decision which works because Dennis manages to accompany the champion (Dennis chances to slay the Jabberwock after the champion is killed by the Black Knight).

The &quot;creaking bureaucracy&quot; also includes the inept behaviour of his herald, who is far more concerned with heralding than in the message he is communicating, a process which eventually prevents the King from speaking and ends with the herald losing his head.

===Accidental and unconventional happiness===
An important theme that Gilliam cited on the film&#x27;s audio commentary is happiness. By the end of the film Dennis gets everything a fairy tale hero would want (recognition for killing the beast, the princess&#x27; hand in marriage and half of the kingdom) by accident. All Dennis wanted was to live a humdrum life, with an overweight peasant girl who didn&#x27;t even like him.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Jabberwocky&quot; received a mixed response from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 45%, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the film a positive review, describing it as &quot;the most marvelously demented British comedy to come along since &quot;Monty Python and The Holy Grail&quot;, to which &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; is a sort of stepson.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a mixed review, praising the monster as &quot;inspired dark imagination,&quot; but ultimately describing the film as &quot;long on jabber but short on yocks.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a one-star negative review, calling it &quot;a film suitable for those who like unfunny comedies&quot; and added that &quot;to link it to Lewis Carroll or to his poem is to insult both.&quot; He further commented, &quot;&quot;Jabberwocky&quot; is being billed as made by the Monty Python comedy crew, with artwork that suggests it&#x27;s a sequel to &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail That&#x27;s misleading on both counts. Only a couple of the Python gang (seen regularly on WTTW-Ch. 11) contributed to the script, and the result is a crude and totally unfunny picture. [...] When in doubt, the script resorts to jokes about urination, defecation, or dismemberment.&quot;

<doc id="758654" wikidata="Q6110055" url="?curid=758654" title="Jabberwocky (TV series)">
<text>Jabberwocky is an American daily children&#x27;s television program designed for 5–10 year-olds that went into national syndication. The original series ran Monday through Friday for over two seasons, from 1972 to 1974, on WCVB-TV in Boston. Starting in 1974, the nationally syndicated version ran weekly and was rerun in the early hours of Saturday mornings by many television stations up until the 1990s.

==Synopsis and history==
Created and videotaped by WCVB-TV Channel 5 Boston, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; featured real actors and puppets and various interstitial cartoons. The &quot;show within a show&quot; concept featured actress JoBeth Williams—in one of her earliest roles—and actor Tucker Smallwood as the &quot;lead performer&quot; and &quot;director&quot; respectively of a children&#x27;s show. The actress and director were played by Joanne Sopko and Carl Thoma in the first season. Harvard professor and psychologist Jerome Kagan was an advisor to the program.

The friendly antagonist in most episodes was puppet character Dirty Frank, who popped up from whatever packing crate was convenient. As a representative alter-ego for children, Dirty Frank&#x27;s inquisitive nature and his sloppy behavior drove the plot of most episodes.

Another main character was the helpful and venerable Mr. Buchanan (actor Robert Prosky), a human handyman-prop master who concocted various inventions to help children in his backstage workshop. In many episodes, Mr. Buchanan&#x27;s failed inventions and grandfatherly insights led the characters toward answers to their questions.

The characters were seen in a studio set, but episodes often took them out into the Greater Boston area for miniature documentary segments.

Co-creators Fred Schilpp (Executive Producer) and Adam Villone (Head Writer) wrote many of the episodes along with Dewey Bergman and Joseph A. Bailey. Tucker Smallwood was also an occasional segment writer for the show. The animation sequences, and the puppets, were created by Tom and Bob Jurkowski. The original theme music was written and produced by David Lucas of David Lucas Associates, a commercial music house in New York. Gail Frank was Producer and eventually became Executive Producer. Peter Johnson, the puppeteer, was trained by Caroll Spinney (Big Bird) from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and Children&#x27;s Television Workshop.

The value-based program won several major broadcasting awards including a citation from Action for Children&#x27;s Television, the first ever given to a commercial television program.

==Reruns and syndication==
WCVB-TV continued to air &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; well after it went out of production, as it became part of the station&#x27;s past legacy of original local programming (for over two decades, WCVB was known for producing more local programming than any other station in the U.S.). By the mid-to-late 1980s, the show could always be seen Saturday mornings at 5 a.m., followed by off-network reruns and later, in the 1990s, by syndicated children&#x27;s programming that lead up to ABC&#x27;s Saturday Morning lineup (most notably &quot;Cappelli &amp; Company&quot;). However, WCVB did venture into original children&#x27;s programming post-&quot;Jabberwocky&quot;; subsequent shows included &quot;The Nature World of Captain Bob&quot;, &quot;Pixanne&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Rapmatazz&quot; and &quot;A Likely Story&quot;.

By 2000, after continually airing for more than 25 years, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, along with classic airings of &quot;The Nature World of Captain Bob&quot;, vanished off the station&#x27;s schedule.

<doc id="758660" wikidata="Q1681107" url="?curid=758660" title="James Simpson (Canadian politician)">
<text>James &quot;Jimmie&quot; Simpson (1873 – September 24, 1938) was a British-Canadian trade unionist, printer, journalist and left-wing politician in Toronto, Ontario. He was a longtime member of Toronto&#x27;s city council and served as Mayor of Toronto in 1935, the first member of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation to serve in that capacity. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada.

==Early life==
Simpson was born in Lancashire, England and immigrated to Canada at the age of 14. Never attending high school, Simpson worked selling newspapers at the age of 10 and then began working for a grocer at the age of 13 before moving to Canada where he worked in a tin factory before joining the printing trade.

== Career ==

=== Printing trade and journalism ===
In 1892, Simpson was one of 27 members of the Typographical Union on strike against the &quot;Toronto News&quot;. The strikers, including Simpson, founded the &quot;Evening Star&quot; on November 3, 1892, as a strike paper. For ten years, Simpson served as the &quot;Star&quot; City Hall reporter including nine years as the paper&#x27;s municipal editor. He subsequently became editor of a labour newspaper.

In 1900, Simpson and eight others founded the Ruskin Literary and Debating Society. He served as its first president. Today, it is Canada&#x27;s oldest debating society.

=== Labour leader ===
Simpson went on to become a labour leader and was the vice-president of the Toronto and District Trades and Labour Council at the turn of the century and also served three terms as vice-president of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada between 1904 and 1936.

=== Labour Party ===

As a socialist labour politician, he ran in the May 1902 Ontario election in Toronto. As a candidate for the newly-formed Socialist Party of Canada, he ran in Toronto North in the 1905 Ontario provincial election and in a 1906 provincial by-election in Toronto and in the 1908 provincial election, all unsuccessfully.

He was elected and served as a Toronto school board trustee, 1905–10.

He ran for mayor of Toronto in the 1908 Toronto municipal election as a Socialist but was not elected.

He was elected to the Toronto Board of Control in 1914 with the highest vote total ever given a candidate up to that time and sat on the Board of Control again from 1930 to 1934.

He was one of the co-leaders of the Ontario Labour Party (Ontario section of the Canadian Labour Party) in the 1920s and a Labour candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in Parkdale in the 1921 Canadian federal election, in Toronto Northwest in 1925 and 1926 Canadian federal elections but was unable to win election to Parliament.

Simpson played a leading role in opposing Communists in the Labour Party. After Communists convinced the party to withdraw its nomination of Simpson as its candidate for Toronto city council&#x27;s Board of Control in 1927, Simpson and his supporters quit the party leading to its collapse. They then formed the Toronto Labour Party, which explicitly excluded Communists from membership.

=== Mayor ===
In the 1930s, he became a leading member of the Ontario CCF. In 1934 he ran as a CCF candidate for the Toronto Board of Control and was elected which set the stage for him to run for Mayor of Toronto in the 1935 municipal election. The only one of the city&#x27;s newspapers to support him was the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;. The other papers and both the Conservative and Liberal parties supported Simpson&#x27;s opponent, Alderman Harry W. Hunt and accused the CCF of being anti-British and under Communist influence. Percy Parker, a leading Liberal, declared on the radio that &quot;the bells of Moscow will ring when Simpson is elected mayor.&quot;

Simpson&#x27;s personal popularity and the organization put together by the CCF and the trade union movement was enough to elect him making Toronto the largest city in North America to have elected a socialist mayor. As mayor, Simpson supported the campaign to boycott the 1936 Summer Olympics being held in Nazi Germany that summer.

=== Religion ===
Simpson was a Methodist and Christian socialist who became active with the Epworth League movement at the age of 16 ultimately becoming president of the Epworth League Toronto Conference. He also served as president of the Toronto Methodist Young People&#x27;s Union and the Toronto Methodists&#x27; Cycling Union. Simpson was intensely anti-Catholic which cost him the support of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. When he ran for re-election as mayor in 1936 this contributed to his defeat.

==Death==
Simpson was killed in 1938 when his car crashed into a streetcar.

<doc id="758663" wikidata="Q28973" url="?curid=758663" title="Georges Richard">
<text>Georges Richard (1863–1922) was a French racing driver and automobile industry pioneer.

His first automobile manufacturing business, &quot;Société des Anciens Établissements Georges Richard&quot;, was founded in the North-Paris suburb of &quot;Ivry-Port&quot; in 1897 by Georges Richard and his brother Maxime Richard. Originally copying Benz cars of the era, Richard bought a licence, in 1900, from the Belgian Vivinus to build voiturettes. By 1905, however, there had been a parting of the ways with Henri Brasier (who had become Richard&#x27;s business partner in 1901). Georges Richard moved on to create in 1905 or 1906 a new automobile company called Société anonyme des automobiles Unic

==Origins==
During the 1890s George Richard and his elder brother, Félix-Maxime worked in a bicycle repair and manufacturing business. The business flourished and the brothers created a company which they called &quot;Société des Cycles Georges Richard&quot;. It is here, as far back as 1893, that we find the first reference to Richard producing and selling motor cars.

==From bicycles to cars==
The brothers&#x27; belief in the quality of their bicycles enabled them to include a life-time guarantee against manufacturing defects when selling the machines. This enhanced the reputation of Georges-Richard bicycles and sales boomed. New customers included large-scale users of bicycles such as the health services and the military, along with the postal and telegraph services. Expansion led to a name change, and the business became the &quot;Société de Construction de cycles et d&#x27;Automobiles Georges Richard&quot;. The first formally presented &quot;motor car&quot; was a two-seater propelled by a single cylinder 708cc power unit producing a claimed maximum output of 3.5 hp. This &quot;voiturette&quot; was presented at the first national bicycle show to admit motorised vehicles, and would be constructed between 1896 and 1902, being sold under the name &quot;Pony&quot;.

==Henri Brasier moves in==
The brothers took on another partner, Charles-Henri Brasier, in 1901. Brasier&#x27;s influence within the business grew to the point where, in 1902 the name &quot;Georges-Richard&quot; disappeared from the auto-market. However, in 1903 cars continued to emerge from the little factory at 2 rue de Galilée in Ivry, now carrying the Richard-Brasier name.

==Business success and management rivalry==
In 1904 and again in 1905, the prestigious Gordon Bennett Cup was won by Richard-Brasier cars, driven by Léon Théry. This did much to build a strong reputation for the cars. Relations deteriorated, however, between Brasier and Richard, Richard being repeatedly away from his desk due to his motor racing activities and, it was reported, injuries sustained as a result. In 1904 Brasier had himself appointed (sole or senior) executive director (&quot;dirigeant et administrateur&quot;), and gave notice to Richard terminating the agreement between them while purporting to retain both the factory at Ivry-Port and the &quot;four-leaf clover&quot; trade mark which Richard had recently registered for the business. There followed a bitter litigation between the partners whereby Brasier sought to prevent Richard from using the name &quot;Richard&quot; in connection with any future automobile manufacturing activity. In fact, Richard won the legal tussle, but he never would, in the future, use the trade name &quot;Richard&quot; in connection with automobile manufacture. After 1905 Georges Richard was no longer associated with the cars that till then had carried his name. Richard-Brasier automobiles, produced at the same factory as before, were from 1905 badged simply as Brasiers, and retained that name as the business faded from prominence, until the now renamed &quot;Société des Automobiles Brasier&quot; folded in 1930.

Georges Richard himself nevertheless continued to play a leading role in the French auto industry, establishing in 1905 the Unic automobile business which half a century later, having switched its focus from passenger cars to commercial vehicles, had evolved into a leading French truck manufacturer.

==Société anonyme des automobiles Unic==

In 1905, following a meeting with the polymath entrepreneur Baron Henri de Rothschild, Georges Richard obtained sufficient funding to establish the Société anonyme des automobiles UNIC, and to construct a first factory for the new enterprise in the north-Paris suburb of Puteaux, in order to manufacture &quot;unique&quot; motor vehicles tailored to various sets of customer requirements. Initially the company manufactured only light passenger cars and taxis.

In 1922, paving the way for a future in which the company would be known as a truck manufacturer, Unic introduced a 3-ton truck, the Unic M5C. This was also the year in which Georges Richard died, on 22 June, following a motor accident, while on the way to Rouen. For the Unic business, however, the best years still lay ahead.

<text>Theodore Roosevelt National Park is a national park of the United States in the badlands of western North Dakota comprising three geographically separated areas. This park pays homage to the time that Theodore Roosevelt spent in the surrounding area and in the Dakota Territories before they were states. Roosevelt lived in the area after his mother and wife died hours apart on February 14, 1884. Theodore Roosevelt National Park is the only American national park named directly after a single person.

The park covers of land in three sections: the North Unit, the South Unit, and the Elkhorn Ranch Unit. The Little Missouri River flows through all three units of the park. The Maah Daah Hey Trail connects all three units. The park&#x27;s larger South Unit lies alongside Interstate 94 near Medora, North Dakota. The smaller North Unit is situated about 80 mi (130 km) north of the South Unit, and Roosevelt&#x27;s Elkhorn Ranch is located between the North and South units.

Both main units of the park have scenic drives, approximately of foot and horse trails, wildlife viewing, and back country hiking and camping. The park received 850,000 recreational visitors in 2021.

==History==
===Roosevelt connection===

Roosevelt first came to the North Dakota badlands to hunt bison in September 1883. During that first short trip, he got his bison and fell in love with the rugged lifestyle and the &quot;perfect freedom&quot; of the West. He invested $14,000 in the Maltese Cross Ranch, which was already being managed by Sylvane Ferris and Bill Merrifield, seven miles south of Medora. That winter, Ferris and Merrifield built the Maltese Cross Cabin. After the death of both his wife and his mother on February 14, 1884, Roosevelt returned to his North Dakota ranch seeking solitude and time to heal. That summer, he started his second ranch, the Elkhorn Ranch, 35 miles north of Medora, which he hired two Maine woodsmen, Bill Sewall and Wilmot Dow, to operate. Roosevelt took great interest in his ranches and in hunting in the West, detailing his experiences in pieces published in eastern newspapers and magazines. He wrote three major works on his life in the West: &quot;Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail&quot;, &quot;Hunting Trips of a Ranchman&quot; and &quot;The Wilderness Hunter.&quot; His adventures in &quot;the strenuous life&quot; outdoors and the loss of his cattle in the starvation winter in 1886–1887 were influential in his pursuit of conservation policies as President of the United States (1901–1909).

===Park development===
Following Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1919, the Little Missouri Badlands were explored to determine possible park sites. Civilian Conservation Corps camps were established in both of the future park units from 1934 to 1941, and they developed roads and other structures in use today. The area was designated the Roosevelt Recreation Demonstration Area in 1935. In 1946 it was transferred to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as the Theodore Roosevelt National Wildlife Refuge. After a five-year campaign by North Dakota representative William Lemke, President Truman established the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park on April 25, 1947, the only National Memorial Park ever established; the North Unit was added by act of Congress in June 1948. In 1978, in addition to boundary adjustments and the establishment of 29,920 acres (121.1 km2) of the Theodore Roosevelt Wilderness, the park&#x27;s designation was changed to &quot;Theodore Roosevelt National Park&quot;.

==Geography==

The North Unit, the South Unit, and the Elkhorn Ranch Unit cover a total of . The park&#x27;s larger South Unit lies alongside Interstate 94 near Medora, North Dakota. The smaller North Unit is situated about 80 mi (130 km) north of the South Unit, on U.S. Route 85, just south of Watford City, North Dakota. Roosevelt&#x27;s Elkhorn Ranch is located between the North and South units, approximately 20 mi (32 km) west of US 85 and Fairfield, North Dakota.
===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Theodore Roosevelt National Park has a Cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at the North Unit Visitor Center (2008 ft / 612 m) is 3b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -30.6 °F (-34.8 °C), and 4a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -29.3 °F (-34.1 °C) at the South Unit Visitor Center (2261 ft / 689 m).
 
==Ecology==
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Theodore Roosevelt National Park has two classifications; a Wheatgrass/Needlegrass (&quot;66&quot;) vegetation type with a North Mixed grass prairie (&quot;18&quot;) vegetation form, and a Northern Floodplain (&quot;98&quot;) vegetation type with a Floodplain Forests (&quot;24&quot;) vegetation form.

The park is home to a wide variety of Great Plains wildlife, including bison, coyotes, cougars, mustang horses, badgers, elk, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, mule deer, pronghorn, prairie dogs, and at least 186 species of birds including golden eagles, sharp-tailed grouse, and wild turkeys. Nine longhorn cattle roam the North Unit.

The bison, elk, and bighorn sheep were reintroduced to the park. Park officials manage populations of bison, horses, and elk to maintain a balanced ecosystem. The entire park has been surrounded with a woven wire fence which keeps horses and bison inside the park and commercial livestock out. Other animals are able to pass over, under, or through the fence in specific locations provided for that purpose. Elk seek refuge in the park from external hunting pressure. The elk reproduce and have been removed to mitigate resource damage from overpopulation. Prairie dogs are native wildlife that are considered a keystone species because of their foraging and burrowing behaviors that mix soils and promote native plant diversity, critical to healthy landscape ecology. They also serve as a prey base for a variety of other native wildlife.

After the park was fenced, a horse round-up held in 1954 removed 200 branded animals. A few small bands of horses eluded capture and went unclaimed. These horses continued to live free-range in the park. For several years the National Park Service tried to remove all horses from the park. In 1970, a change of park policy recognized the horse as part of the historical setting. Historically, the park conducted roundups every three to four years using helicopters to herd horses to a handling facility and then sold them at public auction. New methods for herd management were tried including contraceptives, low-stress capture techniques, genetics research, and partnerships with nonprofit horse advocacy groups. The 1978 Environmental Assessment document set a population goal for the demonstration herd to 35–60 head. The goal for number of horses and herd demographics is being reevaluated during the development of a new management plan with current research. The absence of livestock would enable reestablishment of natural grazing regimes to benefit native plant life and natural ecosystem function.

Twenty-nine bison were introduced to a South Unit in 1956 and subsequently transferred 20 bison from that herd to the park&#x27;s North Unit in 1962. They are routinely culled down to approximately 350 and 20 animals, respectively. The gathering and reduction of the herd alternates between the two units each year. The bison are shared with Native American tribes to increase numbers in existing tribal herds and provide genetic diversity. The conservation of bison is an ongoing, diverse effort to bring bison back from the brink of extinction. The 2020 Bison Conservation Initiative by the Department of the Interior has five central goals: wild, healthy bison herds; genetic conservation; shared stewardship; ecological restoration; and cultural restoration. Six yearling female bison were transferred from Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge in 2020. National Park Service experts will study the extent to which translocated animals integrate into the established herds.

== Wilderness ==
Created by an act of Congress in 1978, the wilderness covers an area of 29,920 acres (121 km2) and comprises over a third of the area of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. There are two geographically separated sections of wilderness, one in each of the two main units of the National Park. The northern section covers most of the North Unit of the park, in McKenzie County, whereas the somewhat smaller southern section covers only the western portion of the larger South Unit, in Billings County. The southern section is located at .

The wilderness protects from development the wildest sections of the National Park, an area described as badlands where erosional forces have carved steep cliffs into the relatively flat prairie. Bison, pronghorn, elk, mule deer and coyote are all found here, along with hundreds of species of birds such as the bald eagle, falcon and hawk. The wilderness is separated into two sections along with the park, a north and a south unit, by a distance of . The Little Missouri River is on the south side of both units and is credited for being the primary erosional source which created the badlands topography.

 of trails allow access to the most remote sections of the wilderness. Camping is allowed with a permit, however gathering wood for fires is prohibited and overnighters are encouraged to bring a portable stove.

U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are usually allowed with a proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.

==Attractions ==


Both main units of the park have scenic drives, approximately of foot and horse trails, wildlife viewing, and opportunities for back country hiking and camping. There are three developed campgrounds: Juniper Campground in the North Unit, Cottonwood Campground in the South Unit, and the Roundup Group Horse Campground in the South Unit. Wildlife viewing is popular

The brown, dormant grass dominates from late summer through the winter, but explodes into green color in the early summer along with hundreds of species of flowering plants. During winter, snow covers the sharp terrain of the badlands and locks the park into what Theodore Roosevelt called &quot;an abode of iron desolation.&quot;
A museum at the South Unit Visitor Center provides background on Roosevelt and his ranching days. Roosevelt&#x27;s Maltese Cross Cabin is at the South Unit Visitor Center.

Roosevelt&#x27;s Elkhorn Ranch is a separate, remote area of the park, north of Medora, accessible by gravel roads. The foundation of the ranch house and other shops buildings have been preserved, though the other portions of the cabin were removed and re-purposed after Roosevelt vacated the ranch. Threats to the Elkhorn Ranch site include oil development on adjacent lands, particularly visual intrusions and noise pollution from oil facilities and traffic.

The park units are mostly surrounded by grasslands. The area has very dark night skies with excellent star gazing and occasional northern lights.

The town of Medora, at the entrance to the south unit, provides a western experience, with wooden planked sidewalks, old fashioned ice cream parlors, and buggy rides. There are several museums and the Burning Hills Amphitheather with nightly productions of the &quot;Medora Musical&quot; from early June to early September.

<text>The 1956 to 2010 version of the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship was a women&#x27;s professional wrestling world championship in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The company claims a lineage that dates back to September 18, 1956, when The Fabulous Moolah became the third NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion. WWE did not exist at that time, but they claim 1956 for the championship&#x27;s establishment and do not recognize any title changes from when Moolah became champion until she lost it in 1984. Prior to Moolah losing the championship, she sold the rights to the title to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and it became the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, which would again be renamed in 2002 to WWE Women&#x27;s Championship when the WWF was renamed to WWE. With the company claiming a lineage beginning in 1956, it made the Women&#x27;s Championship the oldest active professional wrestling championship in WWE until its retirement in 2010 after it was unified with the WWE Divas Championship, which briefly became known as the Unified WWE Divas Championship. The final champion was Layla.

A new WWE Women&#x27;s Championship was created in April 2016, and although both championships share the same name and the original is considered to be the predecessor, the new championship does not carry the lineage of the original. In September 2016, the newer title was renamed as Raw Women&#x27;s Championship but reverted to WWE Women&#x27;s Championship in June 2023.

==History==
On September 18, 1956, The Fabulous Moolah became the third NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion. At that time, WWE did not exist and would not become a company until 1963, when the Capitol Wrestling Corporation pulled out of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to establish the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Moolah, who bought the rights to the championship in the 1970s, defended the championship as the NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion up until May 19, 1984; by this time, the WWWF had been renamed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In 1983, the WWF disaffiliated with the NWA and Moolah sold the championship&#x27;s rights to the WWF in 1984, and she was recognized as the WWF Women&#x27;s Champion. Instead of beginning her reign in 1984, the WWF claimed the lineage of her reign from when she first became champion in 1956. The preceding champions and the title changes between 1956 and when Moolah lost it in 1984 are not recognized by WWE (although they are recognized by the NWA). As a result, The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s first reign is considered to have lasted 28 years by the promotion.

In 1990, the Women&#x27;s Championship became inactive after Rockin&#x27; Robin vacated the championship following her departure from the WWF. Then in December 1993, the title was reactivated with Alundra Blayze winning a tournament for the vacant Women&#x27;s Championship. However, the Women&#x27;s Championship became inactive again when Blayze was released from the WWF. Blayze, as Madusa, unexpectedly signed with World Championship Wrestling in 1995 and threw the championship belt, which was still in her possession, in a trash can on an episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (in Blayze&#x27;s 2015 WWE Hall of Fame speech, she &quot;returned&quot; the title). The Women&#x27;s Championship was reactivated again in September 1998 during the Attitude Era when Jacqueline Moore defeated Sable to win the title.
After the WWF/WWE name change in 2002, the championship was subsequently referred to as the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. With the WWE Brand Extension in March 2002, the Women&#x27;s Championship at first was still defended on both the Raw and SmackDown brands, while most titles were exclusive to one brand. In September, the Women&#x27;s Championship became exclusive to only the Raw brand. The Women&#x27;s Championship remained the sole championship contested by women, until July 4, 2008, when a counterpart to the championship, called the WWE Divas Championship, was created for the SmackDown brand. On April 13, 2009, the Women&#x27;s Championship became exclusive to the SmackDown brand when reigning champion Melina was drafted from Raw to SmackDown during the 2009 WWE Draft to replace the current WWE Divas Champion Maryse, who had been drafted to Raw.

The Women&#x27;s Championship was unified with the Divas Championship at Night of Champions in September 2010, creating the Unified WWE Divas Championship and making the Women&#x27;s Championship defunct as the unified title followed the lineage of the Divas Championship; the title eventually dropped the &quot;Unified&quot; moniker.

On April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, a new WWE Women&#x27;s Championship (called the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship from September 2016 to June 2023) was introduced to succeed the Divas Championship. This new title does not carry the lineage of either the Divas Championship or the original Women&#x27;s Championship, but is acknowledged by WWE as the successor of both.

==Tournaments==
===WWF Women&#x27;s Championship Tournament (1993)===
The WWF Women&#x27;s Championship Tournament was a tournament to decide the new WWF Women&#x27;s Champion after the title was reinstated after three years of inactivity.

===WWE Women&#x27;s Championship Tournament (2006)===
The WWE Women&#x27;s Championship Tournament was a tournament to crown a new WWE Women&#x27;s Champion after champion Trish Stratus retired from her wrestling career. The first round started on September 25, 2006, and ended at Cyber Sunday when Lita, who Stratus defeated in her retirement match, defeated Mickie James.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

* Melina defeated Wilson in a Lumberjill match.
* Maria defeated Candice, Victoria and Wilson in Bra and Panties Match.
* The final match between Lita and James was a Lumberjill match.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Brand designation history ==
Following the WWE brand extension on March 25, all titles in WWE became exclusive to either the Raw brand or SmackDown brand. The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the Women&#x27;s Championship between the Raw and SmackDown brands.

==Reigns==
Over the championship&#x27;s fifty-six year history, there were 59 recognized reigns between 29 recognized champions and 4 vacancies (there are 6 reigns and 3 people that are not recognized by the promotion). As per WWE&#x27;s official title history, the inaugural champion was The Fabulous Moolah, who defeated Judy Grable on September 18, 1956. Moolah had the longest reign by holding it for 10 years, although the WWE considers it to be longer at 28 years, as title changes between 1956 and 1984 are not recognized by the promotion. The Fabulous Moolah is technically tied with Trish Stratus for the most reigns with 7, but because WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 and Stratus has the most reigns with 7. Mickie James&#x27;s third reign is the shortest at less than 1 hour. Only four women held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: The Fabulous Moolah (who achieved the feat on six separate occasions), Sensational Sherri, Rockin&#x27; Robin, and Trish Stratus.

Despite the title being contested mainly by female wrestlers, the championship was once held by a male, Harvey Wippleman, who won it under the name &quot;Hervina&quot;.

<text>Olin Jeuck Eggen (July 9, 1919 – October 2, 1998) was an American-Australian astronomer.

==Biography==
Olin Jeuck Eggen was born to Olin Eggen and Bertha Clare Jeuck in the village of Orfordville located in Rock County, Wisconsin. Both of his parents were of Norwegian extraction. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940. After serving in World War II in the OSS, he returned to the university and received his Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1948.

He became known as one of the best observational astronomers of his time. He is best known for a seminal 1962 paper with Donald Lynden-Bell and Allan Sandage which suggested for the first time that the Milky Way Galaxy had collapsed out of a gas cloud. He pioneered the now-accepted notion of moving groups, and introduced the idea that these may originate from dissolved open clusters. For the 1965 book &quot;Galactic Structure&quot;, edited by Blaauw and Schmidt, Eggen wrote an important chapter on moving groups of stars. He won the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship in 1985.

Over that time he held positions at Lick Observatory (1948–1956), Royal Greenwich Observatory (1956–1961), California Institute of Technology, Mt. Wilson Observatory (1961–1966), Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australian National Observatory (1966–1977), and at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (1977–1998).

Eggen&#x27;s professional memberships and honors include the American Astronomical Society&#x27;s Russell Lectureship (1985), membership in the Royal Astronomical Society (vice president 1961–1962), Pawsey Memorial Lectureship of the Australian Institute of Physics, member of the Astronomical Society of Australia (president 1971–1972), and member of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

After his death he was found to have been in possession of highly significant historical files and documents that had apparently gone missing for decades from the Royal Greenwich Observatory, including the &quot;Neptune file&quot;. During his lifetime he had always denied having taken the papers or having them in his possession.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison retains a collection of Eggen&#x27;s personal papers and correspondence.
This collection includes material about the large scale developments in post-war astronomy and astrophysics, especially the creation of large (4 meter) optical telescopes in the southern hemisphere. The Eggen Archives are held in the Steenbock Library at University of Wisconsin–Madison Archives.

==Olin J Eggen Scholarship==
The Olin J Eggen Scholarship was established in 2000 to commemorate Eggen&#x27;s contributions. The endowment supports a scholarship for international students seeking to pursue PhD research at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University.

==Selected works==
*&quot;Three-colour photometry of 4000 northern stars&quot; (1968)
*&quot;Contact binaries, II&quot; (1967)
*&quot;Colours, luminosities and motions of the nearer giants of types K and M&quot; (1966)

The lyrical content of the album follows the story of the legendary Rivfader (&quot;Rip-father&quot;), &quot;king-shaman&quot; of the trollish race, and his war against Christian encroachment of the trollish &quot;North Lands&quot;. The trolls gather under the Svartberg (&quot;Black Mountain&quot;) around the ancient throne of Rivfader, who then leads them on a war against the &quot;Tribe of Christ&quot;.
The story acts as an analogy of the conflict between Christians and Pagans in Early Medieval Scandinavia, and many of the concepts appearing in the album are returned to in the band&#x27;s later work. The character of the Troll-King Rivfader, in particular, is a recurring figure, again taking centre-stage for the band&#x27;s fourth album, Ur Jordens Djup.

<text>Daniel Henry Chamberlain (June 23, 1835April 13, 1907) was an American planter, lawyer, author and the 76th Governor of South Carolina from 1874 until 1876 or 1877. The federal government withdrew troops from the state and ended Reconstruction that year. Chamberlain was the last Republican governor of South Carolina until James B. Edwards was elected in 1974.

==Background==
Chamberlain was born in West Brookfield in Worcester County in central Massachusetts, the ninth of ten children born to Eli Chamberlain and Achsah Forbes. In 1862, he graduated with honors from Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones society.

He attended Harvard Law School, leaving in 1863 to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army with the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry, a regiment of black troops. In 1866, Chamberlain moved to South Carolina to tend to the affairs of a deceased classmate.

==South Carolina politics==
Chamberlain entered politics as a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention from Berkeley County. He served as state attorney general from 1868–1872 in the administration of Governor Robert K. Scott. After he failed to win the Republican nomination for governor in 1872, Chamberlain practiced law in Charleston. His partner later recalled that he worked hard for little compensation; whatever his ethics in office, he certainly had not amassed a fortune. In 1873, he was elected to the board of trustees of the University of South Carolina as the first black students were admitted and faculty hired for the institution.

Chamberlain was elected Republican governor on November 3, 1874, when he defeated John T. Green. Chamberlain received 80,403 votes (53.9%) to Green&#x27;s 68,818 votes (46.1%). Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation had been a dubious one; there certainly was evidence of a willingness to make his office pay, and possibly of corruption, in his earlier career. But by the time he became governor, he had become the representative of those Republicans convinced of the need for reform—a conviction strengthened by the notorious administration of his predecessor, Franklin J. Moses, Jr., and the national publicity given to &quot;The Prostrate State&quot;, the exposure of South Carolina political conditions written by James Shepherd Pike.

Chamberlain delivered on his promises. While continuing his support of civil rights, he made war on government expenses and the high tax levels in the state. He tried to reduce all public officers&#x27; wages by a third and used his veto against tax rates that he considered too high. He urged that spending be cut for the lunatic asylum and that many of its inmates be shipped off to county poorhouses. Instead of paying so much for the penitentiary, he endorsed revival of the convict-lease system. He believed that there should only be half as much money for the agricultural college, and an end to any state scholarship program. As for the state university, Chamberlain called for dismissing its faculty and replacing them with school teachers. &quot;We only want a good high school&quot;, as he put it. His struggles over patronage pitted him against some of the leading African-American Republicans in the legislature and gave him a national reputation. It also made him deep enemies in the party.

Enjoying a close alliance with the Democratic editor of the &quot;Charleston News and Courier&quot;, Chamberlain may have hoped for bipartisan support in his bid for re-election. It did not come. South Carolina Democrats chose to adopt a white-supremacy program, re-enforced with intimidation and the use of force against black Republican voters. The bitterly fought 1876 campaign was disrupted with mob violence and gunmen breaking up Republican campaign meetings. After Chamberlain informed President Ulysses S. Grant of the violent situation, Grant sent troops in October 1876 under General of the Army William T. Sherman to stop the violent mob action. On election night, his second term hinged on disputed votes from Laurens and Edgefield counties, where the counts greatly exceeded the total population. These overwhelmingly favored his opponent, ex-Confederate Wade Hampton, III.

Through the winter, Chamberlain and Hampton both claimed to lead the lawful government, but Chamberlain&#x27;s found it nearly impossible to raise the money or military force to function beyond the rooms in which it met. Chamberlain left South Carolina in April 1877 when President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew Federal troops to barracks from their place protecting the Republican government and ended the interventions that had taken place intermittently in the state since the Civil War. Embittered, Chamberlain blamed the President for having betrayed the mass of South Carolina&#x27;s voters; the population was 58% African American. In later years, however, he grew disillusioned with Reconstruction and contended that letting black people vote had been a mistake.

==Later years==
Chamberlain moved to New York City and became a successful Wall Street attorney. He was a professor of constitutional law at Cornell University from 1883 until 1897. Chamberlain authored the 1902 book &quot;Charles Sumner and the Treaty of Washington&quot;, as well as numerous articles.

Upon his retirement, he traveled extensively in Europe. He moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he died of cancer on April 13, 1907. He is interred at Pine Grove Cemetery in West Brookfield, Massachusetts.

Chamberlain was the last Republican to fill a high office in South Carolina until 1964, when U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond defected from the Democratic to the Republican parties.

<text>This article consists of tables outlining a number of physical quantities.

The first table lists the fundamental quantities used in the International System of Units to define the physical dimension of physical quantities for dimensional analysis. The second table lists the derived physical quantities. Derived quantities can be expressed in terms of the base quantities.

Note that neither the names nor the symbols used for the physical quantities are international standards. Some quantities are known as several different names such as the magnetic &quot;B-field&quot; which is known as the &quot;magnetic flux density&quot;, the &quot;magnetic induction&quot; or simply as the &quot;magnetic field&quot; depending on the context. Similarly, surface tension can be denoted by either &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;γ&quot; or &quot;T&quot;. The table usually lists only one name and symbol that is most commonly used.

The final column lists some special properties that some of the quantities have, such as their scaling behavior (i.e. whether the quantity is intensive or extensive), their transformation properties (i.e. whether the quantity is a scalar, vector, matrix or tensor), and whether the quantity is conserved.

<doc id="758693" wikidata="Q1368788" url="?curid=758693" title="Voyageurs National Park">
<text>Voyageurs National Park is a national park of the United States in northern Minnesota established in 1975. It is located near the city of International Falls. The park&#x27;s name commemorates the &quot;voyageurs&quot;—French-Canadian fur traders who were the first European settlers to frequently travel through the area. Notable for its outstanding water resources, the park is popular with canoeists, kayakers, other boaters, and fishermen. The Kabetogama Peninsula, which lies entirely within the park and makes up most of its land area, is accessible only by boat. To the east of the park lies the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

The park has several boat ramps and visitor centers on its periphery, though the main body of the park is only accessible by boat or, in the winter, by snowmobile, ski, or snowshoe. In 2018, the park hosted 239,656 visitors.

==Geology==
Voyageurs National Park is located on the Canadian Shield, with the rocks averaging between 1 and 3 billion years old. These are some of the oldest rocks on the North American continent. Formed during the early ages of the earth formation, the rocks of the park were compressed, and folded under tremendous pressure. Then molten flows of lava intruded through the layers creating a mosaic of various gneiss and granites. Over time, additional layers of sedimentary rocks developed on top, to be stripped away by the continental glaciers of the Wisconsin Glacial epoch and earlier.

Most of the rocks in the park belong to the Archeon Quetico Subprovince, of the Superior Physiographic province, associated with the Kenoran Orogeny. These consist of schists and gneisses in the west and central portion of the park, and granitic rocks of the Vermillion Granitic Complex (2.69 to 2.64 Ga) in the east and southeast. The Kabetogama-Kenora dike swarm (2.2. to 2.1 Ga) follows a northwesterly trending Precambrian fault system. The northwest corner of the park contains metamorphosed rocks of the Wabigoon subprovince, which form a northeast trending greenstone belt. A lateral strike-slip fault separates the two subprovinces, referred to as the Rainy Lake-Seine River fault zone. It is this northwest area of the park, on the Kabetogama peninsula, which saw a gold rush from 1893 to 1898. The Little American Mine, on Little American Island, is one of 13 abandoned mines within park boundaries. Terminal moraines are found in the southern portion of the park, while the northern portion contains glacially scoured lake basins, but accumulations of glacial outwash and glacial till less than 100 feet is the norm. Lake Agassiz deposits are evident within the park, while glacial striations and glacial erratics are common.

==Access==
The largest city near Voyageurs National Park is International Falls, Minnesota. Unlike many other national parks, where the main access to the park is by motor vehicle, bicycle or foot, the primary access to Voyageurs is via water. Many visitors travel by kayaks and canoes, while others rent houseboats or take a guided tour boat.

==Waters==

The park encompasses all or part of four major lakes:

* Rainy Lake – long, of shoreline, , max depth
* Kabetogama Lake – long, of shoreline, , max depth
* Namakan Lake – long, of shoreline, , max depth
* Sand Point Lake – long, of shoreline, , max depth

Of these, Namakan, Rainy and Sand Point lakes straddle the United States-Canada border. Lake Namakan and Sand Point Lake are accessible only by boat except in the winter. The southern boundary of the park is the northern shore of Crane Lake. The park has many smaller lakes, especially on the Kabetogama peninsula. The most popular of these are on the Locator Lakes trail.

==Activities==

=== Camping===

Campsites are maintained by the National Park Service and are accessible only by water. The 282 sites are classified as frontcountry or backcountry tent, houseboat, or day-use sites; all are designated by signs. Tenters may not camp in houseboat sites or day-use sites. Maps showing the location of these sites are available at the visitor centers. Permits are required for overnight stays. Permits can be obtained at recreation.gov and any park visitor center or boat ramp. Public and private campgrounds, accessible by car, are located near the perimeter of the park.

===Fishing===
The major lakes in the park are home to Walleye, Northern pike, Muskellunge, Smallmouth bass, and Crappie. In the minor lakes that dot the park, Largemouth bass, Lake trout, Bluegill and other small sunfish and Yellow Perch are also found, although not every lake has every species. For example, Lake Trout are found primarily in Cruiser Lake north of Kettle Falls. Shoepack and Root (Little Shoepack) lakes in the center of the park&#x27;s peninsula are home to the Shoepack strain of Muskellunge, distinctly different from the Mississippi strain (or Leech Lake strain) found throughout southern Minnesota and Wisconsin. Lake Whitefish are also a popular quarry via sport netting in the fall when they move into shallow water to spawn.

===Boating===
Visitors travel and explore the park&#x27;s lakes and islands with canoes, kayaks and motorboats. The park&#x27;s interior peninsula is only accessible by boat except when frozen lakes provide outer routes. The park has a system of canoes and boats available for rental at interior lakes. During summer months, the park also offers shuttle service to an interior lake, as well as ranger-led boat tours that explore the park&#x27;s natural features and history.

===Hiking===
The park has over of hiking trails. While some trails are located on the mainland, the majority traverse the park&#x27;s interior peninsula, including long-distance backcountry trails.

===Stargazing===
The Voyageurs Forest Overlook, Beaver Pond Overlook, and the Kettle Falls Dam area are all popular stargazing locations in the park. In 2020, the International Dark-Sky Association awarded the park its International Dark Sky Park certification.

===In winter===

The park is snow-covered from late November until early April. An ice road on Rainy Lake is plowed and marked from the visitor center&#x27;s boat ramp, heading toward Cranberry Bay or around Dryweed Island, depending on ice conditions. Available activities include lake driving, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, winter camping, ice fishing and snowshoe hiking. Snowmobiling is limited to the frozen lake surfaces and the Chain of Lakes Scenic Trail through the center of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Trail maps can be obtained from the visitor centers.

The use of snowmobiles in Voyageurs National Park, like in Yellowstone, is controversial, with opponents claiming they damage the natural beauty of the park and adversely affect wildlife.

Designated Snowmobile Trails
&quot;Rainy Lake Trail&quot; is long running from Black Bay (the Rainy Lake Visitor Center) to Kettle Falls. It runs along the northern shore of the Kabetogama Peninsula, running inside the off shore islands. As it nears Kettle Falls, it turns south up a deep bay and then overland to avoid the soft ice along the narrows.

The &quot;Kettle Falls Trail&quot; is runs overland along the narrows, avoiding the soft and fractured ice of the narrows, until reaching the western end of Namakan Lake.

The &quot;Rudder Bay Trail&quot; is a short connecting trail acround the north side of the western Namakan Lake and Voyageur narrows, to the Ash River Visitor Center. Here, it joins into the Voyageur Trail.
The &quot;Voyageur Trail&quot; is a multiple segmented trail, beginning near the Thunderbird Lodge. From Black Bay (Rainy Lake Visitor Center), it is nearly long to the junction with the &quot;Chain of Lakes Trail&quot; on the Kabetogama Peninsula. An additional crossing the west end of Kabetogama Lake brings you into the Kabetogama community with a short or so drop around the point to the Kabetogama Visitor Center. In the Kabetogama community, there are linkes to the &quot;Arrowhead Trail&quot;, &quot;Woody&#x27;s Trail&quot;, &quot;Peterson Bay Trail&quot;, &quot;Tone Dawg Trail&quot;, and the &quot;Ray Access Spur&quot;.

After leaving the Kabetogama Visitor Center, the &quot;Voyageur Trail&quot; crosses the south side of Kabetogama Lake for , to the Kabetogama Narrows (Ash River Visitor Center) and the &quot; Rudder Bay Trail&quot;. Another brings it to Ash River. In Ash River, there are links to other trails, including &quot;Bill Morgan Trail&quot; and the &#x27;Ash River Links&quot; to both the Arrowhead Trail and Crane Lake. By staying on the &quot;Voyageur Trail&quot;, you&#x27;ll cross the southern shore of Namakan Lake and then turn south through Nakd Point Lake, Mukoda Lake and Crane Lake to Crane. This last link is long. The entire length of the &quot;Voyageur Trail&quot; is about .

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Voyageurs National Park has a humid continental climate with warm summers and year-round precipitation (&quot;Dfb&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at the Ash River Visitor Center (1129 ft / 344 m) is 3a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -36.3 °F (-37.9 °C).

==Flora and fauna==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Voyageurs National Park has two classifications; a Great Lakes Spruce/Fir (&quot;93&quot;) vegetation type with a Northern Conifer Forest (&quot;22&quot;) vegetation form, and a Great Lakes Pine (&quot;95&quot;) vegetation type with a Northern Conifer Forest (&quot;22&quot;) vegetation form.

This national park is home to timber wolves, black bear, moose, an abundance of white-tailed deer, and smaller mammals such as fox, beaver, river otter, muskrat, snowshoe hare, and weasel which may be seen crossing frozen lake surfaces during the winter. In October 2022, a male cougar was spotted by a camera trap in the Park boundaries. Bald eagle, loon, double-crested cormorant, owl, and warblers are common birds found.

==History==
The park was first proposed in April 1891 by the Minnesota Legislature in a resolution requesting that the president create a national park in the state. It wasn&#x27;t until nearly eighty years later that federal legislation authorizing the creation of the park was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on January 8, 1971. Established in 1975, this is Minnesota&#x27;s only national park.

===First inhabitants===
Voyageurs National Park has been occupied by humans for nearly 10,000 years. During the Paleo-Indian Period, people entered this area as the waters from glacial Lake Agassiz receded. Then during the Archaic Period (8,000 B.C. - 100 B.C.) nomadic people moved with the animals they hunted and with the ripening grains. Fishing grew into a major source of food during this time. The Woodland Period (100 A.D.- 900 A.D.) saw an increase in the use of the wild rice. Beginning around this time, they used ceramics to create small, side-notched triangular projectile points.

===The Fur Trade===
European exploration began about 1688. French explorer Jacques de Noyon wintered along the Rainy River. But it was the demand for beaver pelts that brought the fur traders. As competition in the east depleted the beaver, the voyageurs expanded their range into the northwest territories of North America. Here along the modern border of the United States and Canada, the Cree, Monsoni, and Assiniboine tribes were first Native American contacts. By the mid-18th century these people had abandoned the Rainy Lake area, to the Ojibwe. By 1780 the Ojibwe were the primary residents on the border. They filled key roles as suppliers of food, furs, and canoes.

===Logging===
Logging came to the northwoods as the stands of white pine in Michigan, Wisconsin and central Minnesota were harvested. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, logging grew until there were two major logging companies. The International Logging Company in Koochiching County used sawmills at International Falls and Fort Frances until 1937. It was the constant need for water that caused the dams to be constructed at International Falls, Kettle Falls, and Squirrel Falls in the early 1900s. The Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company harvested trees to the east in Saint Louis County. They rafted logs down river to Hoist Bay until 1929. Hoist Bay is named for the machinery used to hoist floating logs out of the lake. Trains then took them to sawmills in Virginia, Minnesota. The logging has altered the composition of the forest. Where white and red pine once dominated the forest, they are a minor part. Few stands of large, mature trees exist in the park.

===The Rainy Lake gold rush===
In the summer of 1893 George Davis, funded by Charles Moore, discovered gold on Rainy Lake. Davis was on a small island near Black Bay Narrows. Here, he found a gold-bearing quartz vein. The &quot;Little American&quot; discovery gave rise to the island&#x27;s modern name, Little American Island. With confirmation of the discovery, Charles Moore hired Jeff Hildreth, a miner from the Black Hills to obtain title to the island. In the spring of 1894, development of the mine and of the nearby Rainy Lake City began. Rainy Lake City was incorporated on March 17, 1894. By summer the city was a community of several hundred people. It had a school house, bank, general store, hotels, restaurants, a newspaper, hardware store, butcher shop, and several saloons.

With the development of the Little American Mine, other prospectors entered into the search. Mining remains which can still be seen (13 sites in all within the park boundaries) include those of the Lyle Mine north of Dryweed Island, the Big American Mine on Big American Island, the Bushyhead Mine on Bushyhead Island, and the Soldier Mine on Dryweed Island. The low production from the mines ended the rush with a bust by 1898. The town of Rainy Lake City was gone by 1901.

===Settlement and recreation===
When the park was established in 1975, there were over 60 resorts around the park. Within the park, there were 12 resorts, 97 leased cabin sites, and over 120 privately owned recreational homes. Many sold their land and buildings to the park. Some people chose to sell their property and leave immediately, while others chose to sell their property, but maintain use for either a lifetime tenancy or a 25-year use and occupancy reservation. As these properties are vacated, the park will remove many structures to restore natural conditions. Twenty properties, containing over 50 structures, will be retained and managed by the National Park Service because of their historic significance.

===Commercial Fishing===
Large fishing operations began on the Rainy River in 1892. By the 1890s and early 1900s, seven or eight fishing companies operated in the area. Most were on Crane Lake. The main production was caviar, taken from the eggs of lake sturgeon. Most fell by the wayside as long distances and a lack of refrigeration affected the industry. By the 1930s all the large operations were gone.

Family fishing replaced the large operations. By 1910 there were around 48 family business&#x27;. The catch was sold at local auctions held at Kettle Falls. By 1923, commercial fishing was banned on Kabetogama Lake. By 1942 only 10 licensed family operations were active. Old fishing camps and net-tarring sites still exist in the park. The best preserved is the Oveson Fish Camp (c. 1950s).

==Points of interest==
===Visitor Centers===
The park has three visitor centers for obtaining information, viewing films, and seeing exhibits about the park&#x27;s geology, wildlife, plants, and history:
===Rainy Lake sites===

Kettle Falls HotelKettle Falls is located between Lake Namakan and Rainy Lake, and is the location of the Kettle Falls Hotel. The hotel was constructed in 1910 by timber baron Ed Rose and operated as a hotel and resort to this day. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Kettle Falls can only be reached by boat in the summer months and is one of the few places in the lower forty-eight states where one looks south into Canada.

Anderson Bay
Anderson Bay is a fine example of why the park was established. The bluffs of the Bay rise above the water. From the top, there are views of the bay and Rainy Lake. Anderson Bay is the northern trailhead for the Cruiser Lake Trail system. From the landing, a loop trail goes to the top of the bluffs. Anderson Bay is two-thirds of the way from Rainy Lake Visitor Center to Kettle Point. It is on the north side of the Kabetogama Peninsula.

Surveyor&#x27;s IslandSurveyor&#x27;s Island is on the east end of Rainy Lake marking the entry to the American Channel to Kettle Falls. Here the boundary surveyors had a campsite during the early 1900s. Voyageurs would use this island as a stop before they entered the open waters of Rainy Lake.

Camp MarstonCamp Marston was where Iowa State University operated a summer camp from 1922 until 1940. Civil engineering students would attend the camp. Today there is still a cabin known as &quot;Polaris,&quot; where the professors lived, in addition to foundations and chimneys from other structures.

Rainy Lake CityRainy Lake City was a boom town in the 1890s during a short gold rush period. The site has a longer history of use than just the gold rush. A saloon still stands and is proposed as a shelter for exhibits. Former streets and archeological remains of buildings can be seen. Rainy Lake City is the northwestern point of the Kabetogama Peninsula facing Little American Island and the mainland.

Harry Oveson Fish Camp
Oveson&#x27;s fish camp is an intact commercial fishing camp. There are still several structures, including Oveson house, ice house, and fish processing building.

Little American IslandLittle American Island is on Rainy Lake just north of the mainland. It is the furthest western island in the park. It was the site of gold discovery in 1893. The island has been upgraded to provide an accessible trail, a comfort station and dock.

===Kabetogama Lake sites===

Ellsworth Rock Gardens
The Gardens was an enchanting sculpture once filled with flowers. Mr. Ellsworth created his garden as a part of the families summer home. Boat tours from Kabetogama Visitor Center visit this site on the northern shore of Kabetogama Lake.

Hacksaw Pass
Here, visitors may visit several wetlands, the Gold Portage, Woodenfrog family residence and other sites related to Ojibwe history.

===Namakan Lake sites===
Hoist Bay 
Hoist Bay has been an area of logging and seasonal recreation. You can spot piers of the former railroad trestle, and buildings from, the resort era. The area is set up for day use. The bay is located on the southern shore of Namakan Lake, east of Ash River and the visitor center.

Moose River Indian Village 
Moose River, enters Moose Bay, west of Hoist Bay. The Bois Forte Ojibwe once occupied the area from the 1760s through the 1930s. They lived in the area of the park until the Nett Lake reservation was established. Five bands lived throughout the park, including the west end of Kabetogama Lake, Kettle Falls, Black Bay on Rainy Lake, Crane Lake, and Moose River of Namakan Lake.

I.W.Stevens Pine Cove Resort
The I.W.Stevens Pine Cove Resort represents the resort recreation period. The site&#x27;s historic buildings are set among large scenic pine trees. The site consists of I.W. Stevens&#x27; home, a guest cabin, sauna, generator shed, and root cellar. I.W. Stevens acquired the property from the Virginia &amp; Rainy Lake Lumber Company. The company chose not to cut the red pine on the site and many of the trees have reached a large, mature
state.

===Sand Point/Crane Lake sites===
Casareto Summer CabinThe Casareto Summer Cabin is an example of summer recreational cabins in the park. It is located on a sand beach.

Grassy Bay
Grassy Bay is a large western bay on Sand Point Lake. It is rich in natural and cultural resources. The cliffs are well-known among park visitors. The Mittet cabin is an example of early recreation (1880s- 1920s).

Ingersoll EstateThe Ingersoll lodge was built by Illinois philanthropist William Ingersoll in 1928. The estate was visible from the lake just north of Harrison Narrows; however, the lodge collapsed in 2014 due to a combination of structural weakness, incomplete maintenance, and heavy weather. The lodge site was subsequently cleared and the lodge&#x27;s remains were put in storage for a possible rebuilding.

==Warnings and safety==

===Boating safety===

Safe channels are marked in the main lakes by the U.S. Coast Guard. When upbound in the lakes, there are green numbered buoys that mark the &#x27;left&#x27; or port side of the channel. Red number buoys mark the &#x27;right&#x27; or starboard side. It is the opposite when downbound. For &quot;Rainy Lake&quot; and &quot;Namakan Lake&quot;, upbound is going east. For &quot;Kabetogama Lake&quot;, upbound is going west. If you&#x27;re on &quot;Sand Point Lake&quot; or &quot;Crane Lake&quot;, upbound is going south.

Hazardous rocks are common throughout the park and can lie just beneath the surface. Less than ten percent of these hazards are marked. The park consists of parallel ridges of rock, which form the islands and the peninsula.

===Winter===
Snowmobiling is a major recreational activity during the winter months. In the heart of the season, the most hazardous areas regarding thin ice or open water are along the river channels including places like Rainy River or any of the narrows. The current under the ice causes pressure ridges and soft spots. Snowmobiles generally avoid these areas.

===Mines===
Thirteen abandoned mines with 22 openings are present in Voyageurs National Park. All are located in the northwestern corner of the park along structures within the Rainy Lake greenstone belt. Some abandoned prospect pits, shafts, and open cuts are concealed by vegetation. These sites have been examined by qualified park staff and do not pose major hazards.

==International Border==
The Voyageurs canoed and portaged the 2,000-mile (3,220- km) journey from Grand Portage to Lake Athabasca. This well established waterway between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods became the official border following the Treaty of Paris (1783).

<text>William Z. Foster (born William Edward Foster; February 25, 1881 – September 1, 1961) was a radical American labor organizer and Communist politician, whose career included serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party USA from 1945 to 1957. He was previously a member of the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, leading the drive to organize packinghouse industry workers during World War I and the steel strike of 1919.

== Name ==
Foster is often incorrectly referred to with the middle name &quot;Zebulon&quot;. He added the middle initial &quot;Z&quot; when he was 28 years old, but according to biographer Edward Johanningsmeier, the initial &quot;was never intended by Foster to indicate a middle name.&quot; He also never referred to himself as William &quot;Zebulon&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
He was born William Edward Foster in Taunton, Massachusetts, on February 24, 1881, the son of a Fenian, James Foster, who had fled County Carlow after the failure of the revolutionary Fenian Rising in Ireland and the waves of arrests that drove hundreds of others out of the country. His mother, Elizabeth McLoughlin, was an English Catholic textile worker. During his peripatetic childhood his mother had nine surviving children of 23 babies she bore.

His family moved to the Irish area of Skittereen within the Moyamensing neighborhood of South Philadelphia, where his father worked as a stableman and was part of a group of Irish-American Fenians. Foster left school at the age of ten to apprentice himself to a dye sinker. Foster left that position three years later to work in a white lead factory. Over the next ten years he worked in fertilizer plants in Reading, Pennsylvania and Jacksonville, Florida, as a railroad construction worker and sawmill employee in Florida, as a streetcar motorman in New York City, as a lumber camp and longshoreman in Portland, Oregon and as a sailor. Foster even homesteaded for a year in Oregon in 1905, although he also worked a series of odd jobs as a miner, sheepherder, sawmill worker and railroad employee during that year before abandoning the farm.

===Entry into politics and trade union work===
Foster joined the Socialist Party of America in 1901 and was a member in the party&#x27;s Washington state affiliate until he left the party in the midst of a faction fight. Foster then joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1909, when he took part in one of the IWW&#x27;s free speech fights in Spokane, Washington.

Foster became a prominent figure within the union, serving as its representative at an international labor conference in Budapest in 1911 and a contributor to its papers. Foster&#x27;s politics, however, were moving him away from the IWW. He became a committed syndicalist after touring Europe in 1910 and 1911, and criticized the IWW for not working within established unions or within the workshop in any event. He urged American leftists to enter the AFL unions, rather than establish rival unions, as the IWW had tried to do. He also denounced electoral politics as a dead end that smothered the revolutionary ardor of these groups by channeling their energies into pursuit of office, with all the compromises that entails. Foster lost the battle, however, and soon thereafter left the IWW and formed his own organization, the Syndicalist League of North America (SLNA).

The SLNA&#x27;s policies—direct action at the shopfloor-level leading to workers&#x27; governance of society, but without the dead weight of bureaucratic structures—bore a strong resemblance to the anarchist thinking of the day. That is not coincidental, since Foster was not only lecturing at anarchist groups and settlements, but became a close working associate with Jay Fox, an anarchist with roots in the Chicago labor movement, and married Ester Abramowitz, who had belonged to an anarchist collective in Washington. Among the other members of the SLNA were Tom Mooney (who became a labor martyr when imprisoned for allegedly throwing a bomb at a Preparedness Day parade in 1916), Earl Browder, an accountant and union activist in Kansas City and Foster&#x27;s rival for the Presidency of the Communist Party twenty years later, and James P. Cannon, a member of the IWW and one of Foster&#x27;s allies in the internal warfare within the CPUSA until he was expelled for Trotskyism. The SLNA, however, was never an effective force and folded in 1914.

Foster took his own advice and became a union business agent for a local of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America in Chicago. He continued his syndicalist campaign, this time through the International Trade Union Educational League, while obtaining a position as a general organizer for the AFL in 1915. His syndicalism led him to drop any criticism of the more conservative union leaders; in his eyes, organizing workers was a step toward dismantling capitalism. The ITUEL did not so much seek to take power in those organizations in which its members were active, as to steer them in a more progressive direction.

Foster also tempered his politics at this time: he not only did not publicly oppose the United States&#x27; entry into the war, as Eugene V. Debs, Victor Berger and figures associated with the IWW had done, but helped sell war bonds in 1918. Foster also remained quiet when the government arrested hundreds of IWW activists, convicting them &quot;en masse&quot; in 1918.

Foster did not, on the other hand, become wholly apolitical. The Chicago Federation of Labor (CFL), headed by John Fitzpatrick, was a nest for a number of labor causes: the campaign to free Tom Mooney, plans to launch a labor party, and, most importantly, programs to organize the thousands of unskilled workers in the city&#x27;s packinghouses, steel mills and other mass production industries.

===Organizing packinghouse workers===
Unions had tried to organize the packinghouses for decades before World War I: the Knights of Labor had led organizing drives among these workers in the 1870s and 1880s, while the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen had made gains among the many diverse ethnic groups working in the industry in the first decade of the century. In both cases the industry, now concentrated in the hands of a few large and powerful corporations, drove the unions out.

The war, however, changed things. The demand for meat increased tremendously during the war, while the draft and the difficulty of importing more workers from Europe led to labor shortages that reduced the number of persons willing to scab in the event of a strike. In addition, the federal government had an interest in maintaining production unimpeded and avoiding the disruption that a strike of 50,000 packinghouse workers would entail. This was an especially propitious time to organize these workers on an industrial basis; as Foster said, &quot;The gods were indeed fighting on the side of labor&quot;.

Before the CFL could organize these workers, however, it had to work out the competing claims of all of the various unions that claimed the right to represent segments of the industry. Rather than create a wholly new organization, which would have immediately found itself fighting other unions in the CFL over jurisdiction, Foster hit on the idea of creating a Stockyards Labor Council (SLC) that, like the railroad federations that had recently come into being, would fuse all of the interested unions into a single body with the ability to organize the industry as a whole. Foster obtained the endorsement of his union, the Railway Carmen, for this plan then took the proposal to Local 87 of the Meat Cutters, who supported it enthusiastically and obtained the approval of the CFL on July 15, 1917. The SLC was formed a week later, with representatives from all of the crafts—machinists, electricians, carpenters, coopers, office workers, steamfitters, engineers, railway carmen, and firemen. While this body was only a coalition created for the purpose of organizing workers, and would not have had the authority to bargain for them as a single group, it was an important step toward industrial unionism. Foster was the secretary for the SLC.

Another factor posed a serious obstacle to organizing packinghouse workers: many of the unions in the SLC excluded African-Americans from membership, either overtly or in practice. Thousands of recent African-American migrants from the South had gone to work in the packinghouses and many looked upon their employers as more interested in their welfare than the unions that had either excluded them or shown no interest in organizing them. The SLC, for its part, offered membership in federal unions affiliated directly with the AFL, only to have this offer thrown back at it as &quot;Jim Crow unionism&quot;. The same pattern of division prevailed among immigrant workers, who organized along national or linguistic lines.

While privately convinced that launching a strike under these conditions would be a mistake, and aware that the AFL leadership felt even more strongly on this subject, Foster nonetheless continued to organize as if a strike was in the offing. The rank and file workers voted overwhelmingly in November, 1917 and more moderate leaders, such as Fitzpatrick and the leader of Local 87, used this strike threat to great advantage in negotiating with the federal government and the employers.

The Wilson administration wanted to bring about a peaceful resolution of this dispute and put great pressure on the employers to agree to arbitration of the issues in dispute—wages, hours of work, and union recognition—without a strike, even threatening to seize the plants as a wartime measure if necessary. While the unions had their own reservations about arbitration, they also agreed to it rather than find themselves forced to strike. The arbitrator&#x27;s initial award, ordering the eight-hour day, overtime pay and significant wage increases, was a major victory for the workers. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters&#x27; membership doubled in the months that followed.

Those gains were short-lived, however. The arbitration award had not required the employers to recognize the unions, leading some workers to believe that the government, not the SLC, was responsible for these improvements in their wages and hours. In addition, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters attempted to claim all of the members as its own, breaking off relations with the SLC. Race riots in Chicago in 1919 dissolved what little trust black packinghouse workers had in white-led unions. Once the arbitration award expired in 1919 employers fired union activists; by 1922, after a failed strike, the SLC was defunct.

===The steel strike of 1919===


Foster turned his attention, while the packinghouse campaign was still underway, to another project: organizing steel workers. The problems here were even more complex: in addition to the history of defeated strikes and the deep ethnic divisions within the workforce, the steel mills were also divided by differences in skills, with the higher paid native-born skilled workers often looking down on their immigrant coworkers, who were often unskilled or semiskilled. Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers, that would organize all of basic steel simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL&#x27;s delegate to the AFL&#x27;s 1918 convention to present the plan.

The AFL&#x27;s reception was tepid: it endorsed a special conference to create a committee to organize steel workers, but each international union contributed only one hundred dollars apiece — leaving the committee with somewhat less than the $250,000 Foster estimated it needed. Many unions did, on the other hand contribute organizers, whom Foster used as his base.

Without the funds to launch a truly national campaign, Foster decided to start close to home, sending organizers into Gary, Indiana, and South Chicago, where they received a tumultuous outpouring of support, in August 1918. The Chicago area was not, however, the heart of the steel industry; the Monongahela Valley was.

By the time that Foster sent organizers into that area several months later, however, the influenza epidemic had led the authorities to bar all public meetings; the announcement of the armistice soon led to widespread layoffs in the mills. The union no longer could rely on a tight labor market or a federal government interested in labor peace. The union faced other problems: the rivalries spurred by the constituent unions&#x27; self-interest and the omnipresent power of the industry, which had turned the Valley into a large version of a company town.

Even so, the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Workers managed to sign up more than 100,000 steel workers by early 1919. The strike vote, taken in August 1919, was almost unanimous in favor of a strike. When the steel companies refused to meet with union officials, 250,000 steelworkers went out on strike on September 22.

The National Committee&#x27;s organizing efforts had produced mixed results: while it enrolled around 350,000 steelworkers during the course of the strike, its greatest strength was among immigrant workers. Higher skilled native born workers gave the strike only lukewarm support, while black steelworkers gave it almost none at all in the Pittsburgh area and less than enthusiastic support elsewhere.

The authorities attacked with their customary violence: within ten days fourteen people had been killed, all of them strikers or strike sympathizers. Vigilantes expelled Foster from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, at gunpoint. Foster himself became the focus of a Congressional inquiry that was originally initiated to study the causes of the strike. In the meantime authorities barred strikers from meeting.

Foster spent most of his time raising money and organizing material assistance for strikers and their families. In the meantime General Leonard Wood imposed martial law in Gary while authorities in Pennsylvania broke up strike meetings wherever they could be found. By November, as funds were running low, the strike was losing steam. Foster and the other members of the committee voted to end it in January, 1920. Foster resigned from the committee in order to allow it to continue its work &quot;with a clean slate&quot;.

===Joining the Communist Party===
After his resignation from the National Committee following the defeat of the steel workers strike, Foster was at loose ends. He resigned his position as a Brotherhood of Railway Carmen organizer, but was blacklisted from other jobs on the railroad. He still maintained his friendship with John Fitzpatrick, wrote a book analyzing the steel strike and founded the Trade Union Educational League, which received financial support from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the left-led union that had contributed $100,000 for relief for steel strikers.

Foster had contacts with a number of members of the newly formed Communist Party, but had not joined it after its split from the Socialist Party of America in 1919. The party had, in fact, denounced him personally during the strike as an opportunist and class collaborator, calling him &quot;E.Z. Foster&quot; for the accommodations he was willing to make with the AFL leadership. The CP at this time was still convinced that the revolution was impending; its suggested slogan during the steel strike was &quot;Make the strike general and seize state power!&quot;

Foster was brought closer within the party&#x27;s orbit, however, after Earl Browder invited him to attend a conference of the Profintern, the Red International of Labor Unions, in Moscow in 1921. There he was appointed the Profintern&#x27;s agent in the United States; the TUEL was later made an affiliate of the Profintern in 1923. Foster joined the CPUSA on his return to the United States.

===The Trade Union Educational League===

The TUEL, like the ITUEL and SLNA before it, sought to encourage the development of left activists within the established unions and unite those already there around a platform of industrial unionism, and to support the militant struggle for workers&#x27; rights. In its early years Foster&#x27;s TUEL pursued a course of its own, not attempting to line up its policies with Comintern or Profintern directives or taking direction from the CPUSA. When party leaders complained, the Profintern sided with Foster.

The TUEL took pains to avoid accusations of dual unionism; when the Profintern requested that TUEL start building itself as a mass membership organization Foster demurred, maintaining TUEL as a network of activists with no formal membership. TUEL was strongest in Chicago, where Foster and Jack Johnstone had close relations with Fitzpatrick and many other unionists with a background in labor radicalism. TUEL campaigned for amalgamation of unions into larger, stronger ones—an echo of the IWW&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;one big union&quot;—and creation of a Labor Party—which was an anathema to those who remained in the IWW.

Its first test was the Railway Shopmen&#x27;s strike of 1922, which was crushed by the employers with the help of an injunction that prohibited strikers from trying to dissuade strikebreakers from taking their jobs by any means, including word of mouth or newspaper interviews. TUEL leafleted at picket lines and continued to press for amalgamation of the separate craft unions in the industry.

TUEL also intervened in the internal politics of the United Mine Workers of America, where Alexander Howat was leading a revolt of miners from Kansas, Illinois, British Columbia and Nova Scotia against the regime of John L. Lewis. Lewis responded by ejecting all those connected with the insurgency from the union in 1923.

===The Farmer-Labor Party===
Foster had enjoyed a close relationship with John Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation of Labor. Those relations were strained to the breaking point by the Party&#x27;s decision to pack the convention that Fitzpatrick had called to form a new Farmer-Labor Party.

Fitzpatrick&#x27;s project presented Foster with a paradox: he did not think that electoral politics had much potential for advancing the rights of workers, much less revolutionary goals, and he had even less regard for progressive reformists such as Robert La Follette, Sr. On the other hand, he was attacked from the left within the party for his relations with Fitzpatrick and the CFL, which were denounced as too conservative. Even so, John Pepper, the Comintern&#x27;s representative in the U.S., and those, such as Charles Ruthenberg, who had criticized Foster for his closeness to Fitzpatrick now directed Foster to make the CPUSA an important player in this new party. At the same time the Party&#x27;s newspaper, then known as &quot;The Worker&quot;, published a flattering article about Foster in 1923 that identified him as a Communist, something he had to that point avoided admitting.

Fitzpatrick began to distance himself from Foster when his membership in the Communist Party became public knowledge. Foster and the CP, on the other hand, had enough influence within the CFL to be able to dominate the founding convention with representatives of various organizations, some of them existing only on paper. When the CP appeared to have taken over this new party, Fitzpatrick walked out, leaving the CP with a stillborn organization. From that point forward Fitzpatrick campaigned against TUEL and the AFL began expelling communists from its ranks with a vengeance. The Party likewise split the Minnesota-Farmer Labor Party and repudiated any common work with La Follette. After a disastrous showing in the 1924 elections, the Party dismantled the Federated Farmer-Labor Party it had created.

The split with Fitzpatrick led to the isolation within the labor movement. While Foster and the CP had enjoyed a close relation with Sidney Hillman and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, it began organizing an opposition caucus within the ACWA. Hillman declared the TUEL formation to be a dual union and suspended its leaders, including Benjamin Gitlow.

===Setbacks and successes===

Foster profited in a way from this debacle: he was able to persuade the Comintern to recall Pepper, with whom he had quarrelled over questions of tactics, and the dissolution of the FF-LP was a setback for the Charles Ruthenberg – Jay Lovestone faction, which was largely made up of foreign-born workers and represented the vast majority of the party membership. Forming an alliance with a smaller faction led by James P. Cannon, Foster was able to control the majority of the party&#x27;s leadership in 1923 and again in 1925.

The internecine struggles between the two camps was, however, disturbing to the Comintern, which sent a representative to oversee the Party&#x27;s 1925 convention. A telegram from the Comintern directed the Party, after a vote which Foster had won decisively over his opponent, Benjamin Gitlow, to install Ruthenberg as general secretary of the Party. Displaying uncharacteristically overt anger, Foster challenged the telegram, stormed out of the meeting, and attempted to appeal to the Comintern itself, over the objections of his opponents and even his allies in the Cannon faction, who would not accept the possibility that the Comintern could be wrong.

Foster did not succeed in reversing the Comintern&#x27;s overturning of his election, but did obtain some concessions: his supporters were given control of the Trade Union Committee within the Party and the Comintern recognized trade union work as the most important sphere of activity for the Party. While Foster thought that he had obtained support for effective independence for TUEL, however, he was mistaken.

The Party&#x27;s trade union work in this era, however, went from one disaster to the next. Rivalries within the CPUSA led to the loss of the 1926 New York dressmakers&#x27; strike, as neither the Foster or Ruthenberg faction wanted to appear to sell out by accepting a settlement that the Party&#x27;s members within the strike leadership had recommended. As a result, the Party, which had once held leadership positions within every major New York City local of the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union other than the cutters local led by David Dubinsky, was wholly routed.

The Foster and Ruthenberg factions likewise blamed each other for the defeat of the 1926 strike of textile workers in Passaic, New Jersey, in which the Ruthenberg leadership supported an overt Party role in the strike and what amounted to creation of a dual union. When it appeared that the leadership&#x27;s communist leanings were an obstacle to negotiations, TUEL handed the strike over to the United Textile Workers, which was unable to make any more progress than the CP leadership had.

Foster also played a major role in the revolt against John L. Lewis&#x27; leadership in the United Mine Workers of America. John Brophy, a leader of the UMWA in Western Pennsylvania, ran against Lewis under the banner of &quot;Save the Union&quot;. Brophy might have won if the ballots had been counted honestly, but they were not. Even so, the dissidents retained substantial prestige within the union and were able to establish themselves as a union administration in exile during the 1927 coal strike, running a separate program of strike relief that allowed the strike to continue when the Lewis Administration proved unable to do so.

These efforts were leading in the direction of formation of a rival union, something that Foster rejected but which appeared to be the only possibility left to the Party. As signals from the Comintern indicated the impending change of policy in the Third Period, when the American party was directed to abandon its work within the AFL in order to form separate revolutionary unions, even former supporters of Foster, such as Earl Browder, began criticizing Foster for his reluctance to form a dual union of miners. As it turned out, Foster&#x27;s halting efforts to establish a separate power center within the UMWA had this effect in any case, as Howat, Brophy and his allies dropped out of the &quot;Save the Union&quot; movement as the CP&#x27;s leadership in it became apparent. The Party founded its own National Miners Union in 1928.

In 1928 it also founded the National Textile Workers Union, which in 1929 attempted to organise in union-free North Carolina. The Loray Mill strike in Gastonia ended in a bitter defeat for the workers and the trial and conviction of seven NTWU organizers for conspiracy in the killing of the local police chief. The lead organizer and defendant, Fred Beal later charged that Foster had &quot;directed the whole Gastonia show and that the people in the Kremlin insisted on getting weekly reports&quot;. In its instructions to a loyal witness, and with a view to creating martyrs around which an international campaign could be mounted, Beal believed that the party deliberately sabotaged the defense strategy of sticking to the facts of the case and avoiding inflammatory political statements.

===Foster&#x27;s return to power===

C. E. Ruthenberg died on March 2, 1927, and his longtime factional ally Jay Lovestone took over his position as Executive Secretary of the party. The factional fighting between the Foster and Lovestone groups continued, but now became overshadowed by the larger struggle in the Soviet Union between Joseph Stalin and his opponents.

A firm supporter of Joseph Stalin, Foster split with James P. Cannon in 1928 and supported his former ally&#x27;s expulsion for Trotskyism. Foster was made General Secretary of the party in 1929 with the support of the Comintern, deposing Jay Lovestone, who was sympathetic to Bukharin and whose policies of American exceptionalism were anathema to Stalin&#x27;s new Third Period line.

That Third Period line also called for creation of new, revolutionary unions outside the AFL. While Foster had always denounced dual unionism, he dutifully complied with the Comintern&#x27;s directive, renaming the Trade Union Education League as the Trade Union Unity League. Foster and the Party also followed the line by denouncing social democrats as &quot;social fascists&quot;.

===Eclipse and return to power===
Foster began to lose power within the Party, due to his imprisonment during the Party&#x27;s convention in 1930 and his continuing differences with others in the Party over trade union policies. In 1930, he ran for Governor of New York on the Communist ticket.

Foster was nominated for president for the third time in 1932 (he had been nominated previously in 1924 and 1928), but he suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail and was forced to step down as leader of the party in favor of Earl Browder. Sent to the Soviet Union for treatment, Foster&#x27;s condition only grew worse. A period followed in which Foster was separated from political activity.

Foster returned to politics late in 1935, but was estranged from Browder and those who had risen to power in his absence. While the Party&#x27;s trade union policies in the Popular Front era was close to what Foster had advocated in the 1920s, the Party&#x27;s strength was not in the areas in which it had been active during the TUEL era—garment, railroads, and mining—but in the mass production industries with little history of union organization—automobile and electrical manufacturing, meatpacking, longshore on the west coast, maritime on the east coast, hard rock mining and lumber in the west and public transit in New York City. In the meantime the Party began building a small-scale personality cult around Browder and became a supporter of the New Deal and, to a lesser extent, the Roosevelt administration both of which Foster was critical. Foster became the &quot;loyal opposition&quot; to Browder within the CPUSA while remaining an unwavering supporter of Stalin.

Browder was removed in 1945 due to having attempted to dissolve the CPUSA as a party. Foster had, in fact, been one of the most vocal opponents in 1944 of Browder&#x27;s decisions to rename the CPUSA as the Communist Political Association and to propose the continuation of the no-strike pledge after the end of World War II. The entire leadership of the Party came to Browder&#x27;s defense then; the Comintern directed Foster to withdraw his criticisms.

Foster&#x27;s letter to the National Committee subsequently formed the basis for the Duclos letter published as the Cold War began in 1945 that signaled the Soviet Union&#x27;s change in line. The Party members who had denounced Foster and questioned his grasp of Marxism and his mental faculties a year earlier now condemned Browder as a class traitor. The CPA reestablished itself as the Communist Party USA and expelled Browder. While Foster nominally shared power with Eugene Dennis and John Williamson, he had the most prestige of the three.

During Foster&#x27;s leadership the Party took a harder line, both internationally and internally, shedding much of the &quot;Americanist&quot; rhetoric of Browder&#x27;s dozen years in leadership. Foster published a &quot;new history&quot; of America, which was highly praised in Moscow and was translated into many languages. Of it Browder wrote, &quot;This extraordinary book interpreted the history of America from its discovery to the present, as an orgy of &#x27;bloody banditry&#x27; and imperialism, enriching itself by &#x27;drinking the rich red blood&#x27; of other peoples.

The Party campaigned vigorously for Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s candidacy for president in 1948—which failed to produce a viable Progressive Party. The failure of the campaign and the onset of the Cold War contributed to a disastrous situation for the unions and union leaders associated with the Party within the CIO, which expelled most of them by 1950.

In 1948 Foster was among the party leaders indicted for subversive activity under the Smith Act, but, because of his precarious health, he was not brought to trial. The Party began to implode as a result of these prosecutions, as many Party leaders chose to go underground after the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the first tier of CPUSA leaders in &quot;United States v. Dennis&quot;, . Foster also presided over a number of internal purges.

Foster supported Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He rallied the party&#x27;s faithful during the Soviet Union&#x27;s military intervention in Hungary and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin at the 1956 Twentieth Party Congress. Foster retired in 1957 and assumed the title of chairman emeritus of the party to make way for the younger Gus Hall. Like Foster, Gus Hall was also a loyal ally of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

He was in Moscow for his 80th birthday on February 25, 1961.

===Death and legacy===

Foster died on September 1, 1961, in Moscow. The Soviet Union gave him a state funeral in Red Square and Khrushchev personally headed the honor guard. His ashes were interred with John Reed and Bill Haywood. His book &quot;Toward Soviet America&quot; remains a favorite among American communists, and has been continuously republished by both leftists and anti-communists who see it as scandalous. One edition of the book was published with the subtitle &quot;The Book the Communists tried to Destroy!&quot;

The founding documents of the Progressive Labor Party portrayed Foster as representing the best side of the Communist Party, while blaming reformist and revisionist tendencies on Earl Browder. Many of the groups of the 1970s New Communist Movement eulogized and upheld Foster as their icon. Many biographies of Foster have been published by American academics and historians.

The American Party of Labor claims descent from Foster and his secretary and aide, Jack Shulman.

<doc id="758703" wikidata="Q578492" url="?curid=758703" title="Bulla (gastropod)">
<text>Bulla is a genus of medium to large hermaphrodite sea snails, shelled marine opisthobranch gastropod molluscs. These herbivorous snails are in the suborder Cephalaspidea, headshield slugs, and the order Opisthobranchia.

These snails are popularly known as &quot;bubble snails&quot;, and their shells as &quot;bubble shells&quot;, because the shell of some of the species is very inflated indeed, almost spherical in shape, and is also very thin and light.

According to some experts, &quot;Bulla&quot; is currently the only recent genus in the family Bullidae, which in turn is the only member of the superfamily Bulloidea. The family also includes the extinct genus †&quot;Acrocolpus&quot; .

==Shell description==

All &quot;Bulla&quot; species have large, ovate, external shells, which are large enough to accommodate the whole snail when retracted. All species have rather similarly shaped shells, which have a deep, narrow umbilicus at the apex. No operculum is seen.

The smooth shell of &quot;Bulla&quot; spp. is ovate and expanded, with a deep, sunken involute top. Since little difference exists between the shells and in the morphology of the radular teeth, some uncertainty remains about the exact taxonomy of the species in &quot;Bulla&quot;.

==Anatomy of the soft parts==
The gizzard of &quot;Bulla&quot; is rather different from that of other herbivorous groups. It has three large, crushing plates and ancillary corneous spines, instead of just grinding plates. These crawling snails show prominent, frilled, or lobed parapodia.

&quot;Bulla&quot; species have a soft radula.

==Life habits==
These snails are mostly nocturnal and can be found on shallow, sandy coasts grazing among sea grasses, feeding primarily on green algae. They bury themselves in mud when the tide is out.

==Predators==
In the coastal lagoons and bays of California, the colorful &quot;Navanax inermis&quot; is a well-known predator of sea slugs, especially &quot;Bulla gouldiana&quot;, which it envelopes whole.

==Taxonomy==
This family seems to have evolved separately in an early stage of the evolutionary history of the opisthobranchs. For a fuller treatment of the whole group see Cephalaspidea.

&quot;Bulla&quot;, &quot;Haminoea&quot;, and &quot;Smaragdinella&quot; form the well-defined monophyletic group Bulloidea, according to the 1996 phylogenetic analysis of Paula M. Mikkelsen, but according to Dr. Bill Rudman and others, differences in the alimentary canal and reproductive system still put &quot;Haminoea&quot; and &quot;Smaragdinella&quot; into the separate superfamily Haminoeidea.

Historically, since the 18th century and even in the 20th century, the genus name &quot;Bulla&quot; has been used for a great number of bubble-shelled species that belonged to the order Cephalapsidea. From the mid-20th century, authors began to restrict species to the genus &quot;Bulla&quot; in its current meaning. Misidentifications were still numerous through high levels of intraspecific variability in the shell, radula, and male genital systems. The monograph by Malaquias &amp; Reid (2008) has offered a systematic revision of this genus and has brought order in this genus

<doc id="758704" wikidata="Q1661316" url="?curid=758704" title="Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb">
<text>Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb is a 2003 action-adventure video game developed by The Collective and published by LucasArts for the Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and OS X. It features cover art by Drew Struzan. The game is an adventure of fictional archeologist Indiana Jones. The story takes place in 1935, acting as a prequel to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. The tomb mentioned in the title is that of China&#x27;s first Emperor Qin Shi Huang.

The game had a mixed reception from critics. It was praised for successfully recreating the spirit of the films, but criticised for its camera controls and graphical issues. In March 2015, the game was re-released digitally through GOG.com, and in November 2018, the game was released through Steam.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; is an action-adventure game. It is played from a third-person perspective, and takes place across 10 levels. As Indiana Jones, the player can run, jump, climb, and swim. Numerous enemies appear throughout the game, including Nazi guards. The player has a variety of defensive moves, such as punching and kicking. Various guns can be used throughout the game as well, and the player can also use improvised weapons, such as the legs from broken chairs and tables.

The player is equipped with Jones&#x27; bullwhip, which can be used against enemies. The player can also whip certain overhead objects to swing from one platform to another. Other items include a knife, used for cutting through thick vines. On-screen icons alert the player when to use the whip or knife, and when to perform other actions such as pulling switches and planting explosives. The player&#x27;s health is replenished by drinking from a canteen of water, which can be refilled at certain points in each level. Gameplay is the same on each console.

==Plot==
In 1935 in the jungles of British Ceylon, Indiana Jones searches for the idol of Kouru Watu. After retrieving the idol, Jones meets a Nazi agent named Albrecht Von Beck who also seeks it. Jones defeats Von Beck&#x27;s paid South African ivory hunters and escapes while Von Beck is attacked by a giant, albino crocodile. Back at school in New York City, Chinese official Marshall Kai Ti-chan and his female assistant Mei-Ying inform Jones of the &quot;Heart of the Dragon,&quot; a black pearl buried with the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi. The Heart is said to grant the wielder immense magical power, and Kai wants Jones to retrieve it before it falls into the wrong hands. Mei-Ying breaks open the Ceylon idol to find the first piece of the &quot;Mirror of Dreams&quot; inside, an artifact that will help navigate through the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb and reveal the entrance to Huangdi&#x27;s crypt.

Jones flies to the Prague Castle to acquire the second piece of the Mirror, encountering a large number of Gestapo agents. After solving a series of diverse puzzles and battling a superhuman test-subject, he obtains the second piece before he is knocked unconscious by Von Beck, who had survived the crocodile attack (albeit hideously scarred and blind in his right eye). Von Beck then takes the two Mirror pieces and orders his subordinates to transport Jones to Istanbul where Von Beck intends to interrogate him. Jones wakes up in a prison cell where Mei-Ying appears and frees him. He is surprised to find that the Nazis, below Istanbul, have uncovered the ruins of Belisarius&#x27; sunken city in search for the final piece of the Mirror. Jones makes his way into the ruins and eventually falls into a sunken amphitheatre where he battles the Kraken guarding the final piece. After defeating the beast, Mei-Ying reappears and tells him that Kai is actually the leader of the Black Dragon Triad, the most-powerful crime organization in China. Kai had formed an alliance with the Nazis to find the Heart of the Dragon, but when Jones unwittingly secured the first piece of the Mirror, Kai decided to betray the Nazis in order to get the Heart for himself. Mei-Ying teams up with Jones, both unaware that Kai&#x27;s bodyguards have been listening in on their conversation.

Mei-Ying and Jones go to British Hong Kong in order to infiltrate Kai&#x27;s fortress. They begin at the Golden Lotus Opera House, where they wait for Wu Han, a character who first appeared in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. When Mei-Ying is abducted by Kai&#x27;s men, Jones and Wu Han chase the kidnappers down to a dock in a rickshaw, fighting scores of gangsters along the way. Upon arrival, they see Mei-Ying taken into a submarine by Von Beck. The submarine heads to Kai&#x27;s private island, and Wu Han and Jones follow in a junk.

After infiltrating a Nazi submarine base, Jones spies Von Beck and Kai arguing about their deal. They reach an agreement in which Von Beck can take the Heart to Adolf Hitler when Kai seizes control of China. Disguising himself as a Nazi, Jones makes his way to the peak of Penglai Mountain and the site of Kai&#x27;s Black Dragon Fortress where he finds Mei-Ying guarded by the Feng twins, Kai&#x27;s female bodyguards. After defeating them, Jones falls down a heavily booby-trapped shaft into the temple of Kong Tien where he fights evil spirits and finds a magical Chinese boomerang-like weapon called the Pa Cheng, the Dragon&#x27;s Claw. Eventually Jones finds Kai assembling the Mirror of Dreams and sacrificing Mei-Ying to Kong Tien. Attempting to rescue her, Jones disrupts the ritual, and Kai flees while Mei-Ying is possessed. Jones frees her and together, with the mirror, they venture to the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb where he uses the mirror to cross various obstacles. He is however separated from Mei-Ying, despite his efforts. When he arrives at the terracotta maze at the end of the tomb, Von Beck chases him into a boring machine bent on getting rid of Jones once and for all. Von Beck is killed when his tank falls down a chasm, and Jones enters a portal to the Netherworld.

After crossing a short Netherworld-version of the Great Wall of China, Jones finally finds Huangdi&#x27;s crypt and the body of Qin Shi Huangdi. When Jones takes the Heart of the Dragon, the emperor awakens but is nearly instantly killed by the souls of his victims. Unable to control the power of the Heart, Indy collapses while Kai grabs the pearl. Mei-Ying likewise appears to help Jones, but is shortly afterwards seized by Kai&#x27;s newfound powers. Kai also creates a shield to protect himself and summons a dragon to battle Jones, but Jones uses the Pa Cheng charged with mystical energy to penetrate Kai&#x27;s shield and destroys the Heart. At the moment Kai loses his powers, spirits of his victims rise and mistake Kai for the first Emperor of China. Jones and Mei-Ying flee as Kai is devoured by the dragon.

Back in Hong Kong, Jones attempts to share some romantic time with Mei-Ying, but Wu Han is quick to remind him that Lao Che has hired them to find the remains of Nurhachi, leading into the opening of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;.

==Development==
In January 2002, LucasArts announced that its next &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; video game would be developed by The Collective. &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; uses an enhanced version of the game engine used for &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (2002), also developed by The Collective. The game features more action than its predecessor &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot; (1999). Among the differences is the use of improvised weapons.

LucasArts employee Hal Barwood offered some suggestions to The Collective over their story choices, as the idea of Nazis roaming China didn&#x27;t impress him, but The Collective chose to go on their own way, leading Barwood to feel disappointed with the finished product. Abner Ravenwood, Marion Ravenwood&#x27;s father who has been an unseen character since &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), was going serve as Indy&#x27;s partner throughout the game, but his inclusion was dropped due to how unwieldy his design proved to be for the game.

In the films, Indiana Jones is portrayed by Harrison Ford, whose likeness is also used in the game, but the character&#x27;s voice is provided by David Esch. The game&#x27;s dialogue was written by Brad Santos. The game&#x27;s instruction manual was designed by Gregory Harsh to resemble a field diary written by Indiana Jones. It includes various references to the franchise. The game&#x27;s score was composed by Clint Bajakian, utilizing &quot;The Raiders March&quot; by John Williams.

==Reception==

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to review aggregator Metacritic.

The Xbox and PC versions of &quot;the Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; were received well, with critics praising it for recreating the feel of the movies and well-designed gameplay while criticizing bad camera, controls and some graphical issues.

Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot reviewed each version of the game, and wrote that the soundalike voice actor for Harrison Ford &quot;does a convincing enough job&quot; but felt that some of the other voices &quot;don&#x27;t fare so well&quot;. Gerstmann also wrote that while the plot &quot;contains a few twists and double crosses, the game is very thin on storytelling, only breaking into a cutscene to move you from one part of the world to another&quot;. Gerstmann noted various audio and gameplay glitches in the Xbox version. Gerstmann wrote that the PC version contained less graphical and technical problems compared to the Xbox version, but was critical to the PC version&#x27;s control issues. Reviewing the PlayStation 2 version, Gerstmann noted some graphical issues as severe and said that it pales in comparison to the Xbox version.

In 2017, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; wrote that the game had held up well over time and stated that despite some issues such as a poor camera and &quot;some frustratingly twitchy jumping&quot;, the game &quot;does a superb job of capturing the spirit of the Indiana Jones films&quot;. In 2018, &quot;PCGamesN&quot; included the game on its list of best action-adventure games for PC, writing that while it &quot;has some flaws, such as being unable to save mid-level, &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; earns its place on this list for truly making you feel like Indiana Jones&quot;.
