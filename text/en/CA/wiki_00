<text>Baron Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel (, ; ; 25 April 1928), also known by his nickname the Black Baron, was a Russian military officer of Baltic German origin in the Imperial Russian Army. During the final phase of the Russian Civil War, he was commanding general of the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Southern Russia.

A member of the prominent Wrangel noble family, Pyotr Wrangel was educated as a mining engineer and volunteered in the Russian Imperial Guard. He served with distinction during World War I as a cavalry commander, reaching the rank of major general. After the February Revolution and Russia&#x27;s exit from the war, Wrangel retired to Crimea. He was arrested by the Bolsheviks following the October Revolution, but was soon released and later escaped and joined the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army of the White movement. In 1918, he became Anton Denikin&#x27;s chief of staff in the Armed Forces of South Russia.

Wrangel succeeded Denikin as commander-in-chief of the White forces in Crimea in April 1920. As head of the South Russia military government, he attempted to carry out sweeping land reforms, reorganised the White armies into a Russian Army (more commonly known the Army of Wrangel), and established relations with anti-Bolshevik independence movements. Severely outnumbered by the Red Army and facing certain defeat, Wrangel organised a mass evacuation from Crimea in 1920. Early in his exile he lived in Constantinople and Serbia, and came to be known as one of the most prominent White émigrés. He relocated to Brussels in 1927 and died a year later.

==Family==
Wrangel was born in Novalexandrovsk, Kovno Governorate in the Russian Empire (now Zarasai, Lithuania) as the son of Baron (1847–1923) and his Russian wife, Maria Dimitrievna Dementieva-Maikova (1856–1944). The Baltic German noble Wrangel family was part of the Uradel (old nobility), the family was of German origin, appearing in the old &quot;Livonia&quot; with Teutonic Order. It has a common origin with the noble family von and von . Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was only distantly related to the famed Arctic explorer Ferdinand von Wrangel and the Prussian Generalfeldmarschall Friedrich von Wrangel.

His cousin, Baron Nikolai Von Wrangell (1869 - 1927), also belonging to the Estonian Knighthood, reached high military rank. He was adjutant to the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch (1878–1918), rose to the rank of Colonel as Commander of the 16th Irkutsk Hussar Regiment, and finally to Major General on Grand Duke Michael&#x27;s staff. He married Baroness Elizabeth Hoyningen-Huene.

==Early life==
After graduating from the Rostov Technical High School in 1896 and the Institute of Mining in St. Petersburg in 1901, Wrangel volunteered for the prestigious Life Guards cavalry. He was commissioned a reserve officer in 1902 after graduating from the . He soon resigned his commission and traveled to Irkutsk, where he was assigned to special missions by the Governor-General.

==Military career==

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, he re-enlisted and was assigned to the 2nd Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossack Corps. In December 1904, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

After the war ended, in January 1906, he was reassigned to the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, which, under General A. N. Orlov, took part in pacifying rebels in Siberia. In 1907, he returned to the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. In 1908, he married Olga Mikhaylovna Ivanenko in St. Petersburg, and they had two sons and two daughters. Wrangel graduated from the Nicholas Imperial General Staff Academy in 1910 and the Cavalry Officers&#x27; School in 1911.

With the start of World War I, Wrangel was promoted to captain and assigned command of a cavalry squadron. On 13 October 1914, he became one of the first Russian officers to be awarded the Order of St. George (4th degree) in the war, the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. In December 1914, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In October 1915, Wrangel was transferred to the Southwestern Front and was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks.
The unit was very active in Galicia against the Austrians, and Wrangel distinguished himself especially during the Brusilov Offensive. He was promoted to the rank of major general in January 1917 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussuri Cavalry Division, which was merged with other cavalry units to become the Consolidated Cavalry Corps in July that year. He was further decorated with the George Cross (4th degree) for his defense of the Zbruch River in the summer of 1917.

==Russian Civil War==
After the end of Russia&#x27;s participation in the war, Wrangel resigned his commission and went to live at his dacha at Yalta, in the Crimea. Arrested by the Bolsheviks at the end of 1917, he was released and escaped to Kiev, where he joined Pavlo Skoropadskyi&#x27;s Ukrainian State. However, it was soon apparent to him that the new government existed only because of the waning support of Germany, and in August 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army based at Yekaterinodar, where he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Division and the rank of major general in the White movement. After the Second Kuban Campaign in late 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and his division&#x27;s strength was raised to that of a corps.

In August 1918, Wrangel joined Denikin&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik army. In December 1918, Wrangel became Anton Denikin&#x27;s Chief of Staff in the Armed Forces of South Russia, and in January 1919, commander of the Caucasian Volunteer Army within those forces.
According to Peter Kenez, &quot;Wrangel fought well, but even during his first weeks with the army, he distinguished himself by his arrogant behavior.&quot; After defeating the Bolsheviks in the Northern Caucasus, Denikin wanted to move against Tsaritsyn, but the Bolshevik threat to the west of the Don district forced Denikin to send troops to that Don front. According to Kenez, &quot;General Wrangel bitterly criticized Denikin&#x27;s decision. He was willing to accept not only the loss of the Donets basin, but of the entire Don Voisko because he believed strongly that no goal could be more important than meeting Kolchak&#x27;s advance somewhere along the Volga river.&quot;

Wrangel gained a reputation as a skilled and just administrator, who, unlike some other White Army generals, did not tolerate lawlessness or looting by his troops. However, after he was unable to join forces with Admiral Kolchak and at the insistence of Denikin, he led his forces north towards Moscow on a failed attempt by the Whites to take it in autumn 1919. Continuing disagreement with Denikin led to his removal from command, and Wrangel departed for exile to Constantinople on 8 February 1920.

However, Denikin was forced to resign on 20 March 1920, and a military committee, led by General Abram Dragomirov in Sevastopol, asked for Wrangel&#x27;s return as Commander-in-Chief of the White forces in Crimea. He assumed that post on 4 April 1920, at the head of the &quot;Russian Army&quot;, and he put forth a coalition government that attempted to institute sweeping reforms (including land reforms). He also recognized and established relations with the new anti-Bolshevik independent states, the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, among others, although they were ultimately conquered by the Russian Red Army. However, by that stage in the Russian Civil War, such measures were too late, and the White movement was rapidly losing support, both domestically and overseas.

Wrangel is immortalized by the nickname of &quot;Black Baron&quot; in the marching song &quot;The Red Army is the Strongest&quot;, composed as a rallying call for a final effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to end the war. The song was immensely popular in the early Soviet Union in the 1920s.

From June to October 1920, General Wrangel kept a building in Melitopol as his headquarters. The site later became the Melitopol Museum of Local History.

After being severely outnumbered and facing defeat in Northern Tavria and in Crimea, Wrangel organised a mass evacuation on the shores of the Black Sea. Wrangel gave every officer, soldier, and civilian the choice to evacuate and go with him into the unknown, or to remain in Russia. Those who chose to stay in Crimea were subject to brutal repression by the Bolsheviks as part of the Red Terror, along with many civilians, with up to 150,000 murdered. Wrangel evacuated the White forces from the Crimea in 1920; the remnants of the Russian Imperial Navy became known as Wrangel&#x27;s fleet. The last military and civilian personnel left Russia with Wrangel on board the &quot;General Kornilov&quot; on 14 November 1920.

Initially, Wrangel lived on his yacht, &quot;Lucullus&quot;, at Constantinople. It was rammed and sunk by the Italian steamer &quot;Adria&quot;, which had sailed from Soviet-held Batum. Wrangel, then on shore, escaped with his life in what was widely regarded as an assassination attempt.

==Emigration==
In 1922, he moved to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the head of all White Russian refugees.

In 1924, in the Serbian town of Sremski Karlovci, he established the Russian All-Military Union, a civilian organisation that was designed to embrace all Russian military émigrés all over the world. He tried to preserve a Russian military organisation for another fight against Bolshevism.

In September 1927, Wrangel and his family emigrated, settling in Brussels, Belgium, where he worked as a mining engineer.

Wrangel published his memoirs in the magazine &quot;White Cause&quot; (Белое дело) in Berlin in 1928.

==Death and burial==
Wrangel died suddenly on 25 April 1928, possibly after contracting typhus. His family, however, believed that he had been poisoned by his butler&#x27;s brother, who briefly lived in the household in Brussels and was allegedly a Soviet agent.

He was buried in Brussels. More than a year later, his remains were transported to Belgrade. On 6 October 1929, in a formal public ceremony, his body was reinterred in the Church of the Holy Trinity, Belgrade, the Russian church, according to his wishes.

==Family==

He was married to Russian noblewoman Olga Mikhailovna Ivanienko (1883–1968). They had two sons and two daughters:
*Baroness Helena Petrovna Wrangel (1909–1999); married Baron Fedor von Meyendorff: married secondly to Phillip Hills; had issue
*Baron Peter Petrovich Wrangel (1911–1999); no issue
*Baroness Nathalie Petrovna Wrangel (1913–2013); married to Russian nobleman Alexis George Basilevski; had issue
*Baron Alexis Petrovich Wrangel (1922–2005); married to Ekaterina Nikolaevna von Lambsdorff; no issue

His nephew, Baron George Wrangell, became known by the David Oglivy-created 1951 ad campaign for the Hathaway shirt company in which he was depicted in photos as &quot;a white-shirted, debonair-looking fellow&quot; with a black patch over his right eye, although both his eyes were &quot;perfectly good.&quot;

==Legacy==

The Serbian town of Sremski Karlovci, which had served as his headquarters after he emigrated from Russia, erected a monument in his honour in 2007. At the time of his death, it was the location of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR, which is now based in New York) and the Russian Ministry of Culture.

During the Russian Civil War, the combat song of the Red Army, &quot;White Army, Black Baron&quot;, was named for Wrangel, and its first verse identifies Wrangel as both the leader of the Whites and a serious threat to the success of Soviet Russia.

Many Russian officers regarded Wrangel so highly that he had almost a semi-sacred status. After Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, some prominent military émigrés referred to the position that they believed Wrangel would have taken. For example, Major General Mikhail Mikhailovich Zinkevich said in mid-August 1941, &quot;If General Wrangel were alive today, he would go unhesitatingly with the Germans&quot;.

In 2015, the government of the Russian Federation began to repatriate the remains of White Emigres that were buried abroad, but the descendants of Wrangel refused to have his remains returned to Russia as the current Russian government had not &quot;condemned the evil [of Bolshevism],&quot; referring to Vladimir Putin&#x27;s unwillingness to denounce the Soviet crimes and implement a proper decommunization.

He was portrayed by Russian actor Aleksandr Galibin in the first season of the Serbian television series &quot;Balkan Shadows&quot;, which features Wrangel&#x27;s Cossack emigres as major characters.

In September 2021, following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Wrangel&#x27;s grandson Peter A. Basilevsky compared the &quot;bureaucratic incompetence&quot; of the U.S. government in Afghanistan to the successful November 1920 evacuation of 150,000 anti-Bolshevik soldiers and civilians under Wrangel which became possible with far inferior resources of the White Army and in the face of the advancing Red Army.

<doc id="756350" wikidata="Q980282" url="?curid=756350" title="Kelly Groucutt">
<text>Kelly Groucutt (born Michael William Groucutt; 8 September 1945 – 19 February 2009) was an English musician and the bassist for the rock band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) between 1974 and 1982.

==Early career==
Groucutt was born in Coseley, West Midlands. He began his musical career at 15 as Rikki Storm of Rikki Storm and the Falcons. He sang with multiple outfits during the 1960s, picking up the guitar as he went along. Groucutt was also a member of a band called &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, and later with a band called &quot;Barefoot&quot;.

== Electric Light Orchestra ==

While playing with Barefoot in Birmingham, he was spotted by ELO&#x27;s Jeff Lynne; and after Lynne, Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy had watched him play, he was invited to join ELO, to replace Mike de Albuquerque, who had recently left the band. Upon joining, he was asked to adopt a stage name because ELO had already had several members named Michael, Mike or Mik; he chose Kelly (a school nickname). ELO then set off on their &quot;Eldorado&quot; tour. The first Electric Light Orchestra album to feature Groucutt on bass guitar and as a backing vocalist was &quot;Face the Music&quot; (1975). He assumed lead vocal duties on one or two album tracks typically, and his vocals can be heard on later ELO songs, most prominently on songs such as &quot;Nightrider&quot; (1975), &quot;Poker&quot; (1975), &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; (1976), &quot;Across the Border&quot; (1977), &quot;Night in the City&quot; (1977), &quot;Sweet is the Night&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp&quot; (1979). Groucutt often displayed his operatic vocal talents during live performances of &quot;Rockaria!&quot; (1976), though these were not performed in the studio.

Groucutt continued contributing on the albums &quot;A New World Record&quot; (1976), &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1977), &quot;Discovery&quot; (1979), &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1980), &quot;Time&quot; (1981), and the early sessions for &quot;Secret Messages&quot; (1983). By &quot;Time&quot;, Groucutt&#x27;s role in the band was reduced by Lynne from co-lead vocals to backing vocals exclusively.

In 1982, he released his self-titled, debut solo album, &quot;Kelly&quot;. This album featured fellow ELO members Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy, Mik Kaminski and their orchestral co-arranger and conductor Louis Clark. In 2001, the album was remastered for CD.

Groucutt remained with ELO until the onset of the recording sessions for the album &quot;Secret Messages&quot; in 1982. It was at this juncture that he left the band, unhappy with royalty payments during his tenure, and made the decision to sue management and band leader Jeff Lynne. A settlement for the sum of £300,000 () was reached out of court prior to proceedings, but Groucutt later reflected that he regretted suing Lynne. He is credited with playing bass on &quot;Secret Messages&quot;, although the 2018 album liner notes state that he only played on four songs (&quot;Train of Gold&quot; and &quot;Rock n Roll is King&quot; from the single disc release and &quot;No Way Out&quot; and &quot;Beatles Forever&quot;) from the original double album.

During the mid-to-late 1980s, Groucutt worked further on his solo career, including the &quot;We Love Animals&quot; EP in 1985 to benefit the RSPCA. One of his songs from the EP, &quot;The Fox&quot;, was later reworked for the ELO Part II album &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;. 

Groucutt played a Gibson G3 bass as well as a Fender Precision Bass, an Ovation acoustic guitar and Hofner 500/1 bass guitar during much of his tenure in Electric Light Orchestra.

== OrKestra ==

In the late 1980s, he and former band mate Mik Kaminski formed the group Player, a name soon revised to OrKestra to avoid confusion with the existing rock band of the same name. Groucutt and Kaminski eventually became dissatisfied with the poor promotion and record label the band received, especially as their first album, &quot;Beyond The Dream&quot; was delayed. Though at least one song was ready for use in the 1989 film &quot;Summer Job&quot;, the album itself was not released until 1991. By that point, Kaminski and Groucutt, joined by fellow ELO member Hugh McDowell, had guest starred in a tour with ELO Part II. In 1992, Groucutt and Kaminski dissolved OrKestra and joined ELO Part II full-time.

In 1993, the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; was released under the OrKestra name. It included more material from Groucutt and Kaminski&#x27;s tenure in the band.

== ELO Part II and The Orchestra ==

Initially joining Part II as a guest during a 1991 tour (in which he shared lead vocals with Eric Troyer, Peter Haycock and Neil Lockwood), Groucutt eventually became a full-time member of the band in 1992, shortly prior to Lockwood and Haycock&#x27;s departures. Groucutt would alternate lead vocal duties with Troyer and newly-hired guitarist Phil Bates for much of the group&#x27;s remaining lifespan. When the group released &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, Groucutt contributed the song &quot;The Fox&quot;, and co-wrote &quot;Blue Violin&quot; and &quot;Twist of the Knife&quot;. Groucutt also appeared on the live albums &quot;Performing ELO&#x27;s Greatest Hits Live&quot; and &quot;One Night - Live in Australia&quot;.

While Groucutt was primarily the group&#x27;s bassist, some live performances feature songs in which he would switch to guitar. 

When Bev Bevan sold his half of the rights to ELO back to Jeff Lynne in 1999, Groucutt chose to remain with the group, which was renamed The Orchestra. He again made writing contributions to the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;No Rewind&quot;, by co-writing the closing track, &quot;Before We Go&quot;, on which he also sang lead vocals.

==Personal life==
Groucutt was married twice. In 2006, Groucutt wed Anna-Maria Bialaga. They remained married until his death.

==Death==
On 18 February 2009, Groucutt returned from a sell-out show with The Orchestra in Berlin. He suffered a heart attack shortly after, and died on 19 February at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital in Worcester. His family held a small, exclusive concert with members from The Orchestra in his memory.

After a successful crowdfunding campaign was held by his family, a plaque commemorating Groucutt was placed at his childhood home, where his family lived from 1937 to 1992.

<text>Henning Jakob Henrik Lund or Intel&#x27;eraq (1875–1948) was a Greenlandic lyricist, painter, and Lutheran pastor. He wrote the lyrics to &quot;Nunarput, utoqqarsuanngoravit,&quot; in the indigenous Greenlandic language, an Eskimo–Aleut language. The song was adopted as the national anthem of Greenland.

==Background==
Henrik Lund was born on 29 September 1875 in Nanortalik, a village on the southwest coast of Greenland. He grew up near a community of relocated East Greenlandic Inuit and, like many in his family, devoted himself to work in East Greenland. Lund was of mixed Inuit and Danish descent, described as having Greenlandic features and bluish-grey eyes. His wife was Malene Lund, who was born in 1877 and died in 1979.

He learned to love music and poetry through his family and a local German Moravian mission. His father, Isak Lund, was a head catechist and a poet, whose patriotic sentiments are evident in his works, such as the poem &quot;Nuna Tassa Tupingnartoq&quot; or &quot;This Is a Wonderful Country.&quot;

==Career==
After attending the Danish Lutheran seminary in Godthaab, Lund became the catechist at Angmagssalik in East Greenland in 1900. In 1909, he returned home to West Greenland. He was ordained as a pastor on October 9, 1936, at the Cathedral of Our Lady in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ultimately, he became the local pastor at Narssaq.

From 1923 to 1932, Lund was elected to the South Greenland provincial council. He also painted in oils and watercolor.

==Poetry and song==
He composed hymns in the Greenlandic language, which were published in 1909, 1930, 1937, and 1945. The second issue of a Greenlandic songbook, &quot;Erinarssûtit&quot; features his first published poetry, including &quot;Upernalermat&quot; or &quot;As Spring Is Coming.&quot; Later issues of this songbook include more of his poetry–some secular in nature. His poems can be classified as epic or didactic. One poem, &quot;Igdlugssaq Nápagaungmat&quot; or &quot;When the House Was Built,&quot; details the seemingly minor event of constructing a home in Angmagssalik. While not overtly heroic, this action will be useful and demonstrated community affection. In &quot;Nunat Asingagingmata&quot; or &quot;When the Countries Again Turned Pale,&quot; Lund writes: &quot;We will soon see the country covered with snow, dressed in the garment of the sorrow, and crying in the storm after having bidden good-bye to all the small birds.&quot;

===National anthem===
Lund&#x27;s patriotic poem, &quot;Nunarput Utoqqarsuanngoravit&quot; or &quot;Our Country Who&#x27;s Become So Old,&quot; was written in 1912 and later set to music by Jonathan Petersen (1891–1960). The song was adopted as the national anthem of Greenland in 1916. The lyrics translated from the Greenlandic language into English prose are:

# Our country, when you grew very old, your head was crowned with white hair. You carried steadfast your children in your arms and gave them what belonged to your coastland.
# We who here grew up with you as an immature people, as small children, we want to call ourselves &quot;kalâtdlit&quot; in front of your honorable head!
# And making use of all that belongs to you, we feel a desire to advance: bettering the conditions, which hold you back, we are firmly resolved to go forward, forward.
# We want very much to follow the mature people. We are longing to use the freedom of speech and press!
# There is not at all the slightest reason for holding back. Greenlanders, stand up on your feet, forward! It is well worth to live as men. Show that you can think for yourselves!

This song can be interpreted as being assimilationist in tone and certainly has European influences; however, it also reflects the stirring of national consciousness of early 20th century Greenland. Village and tribal loyalties expanded to encompass the entire country, Kalaallit Nunaat. Since 1979, &quot;Nuna asiilasooq&quot; (The Land of Great Length), an anthem used by the self-governing Kalaallit people, has additionally been officially recognized by the government. Jonathan Petersen wrote both the lyrics and melody.

==Honors==
The Danish king awarded him the two orders: Dannebrogsmændenes Hæderstegn and Ingenio et Arti. Henrik and Malene Lund&#x27;s House, also known as Lund Cottage, built after Lund&#x27;s own design in Narsaq, became a memorial in 1980 and is open to the public as part of the Narsaq Museum.

==Death==
Lund died on June 17, 1948, in Narssaq, Greenland.

<text>Gavin Tudor Lyall (9 May 1932 – 18 January 2003) was an English author of espionage thrillers.

==Biography==
Lyall was born in Birmingham, then in Warwickshire (now West Midlands), England, as the son of a local accountant, and educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham. After completing his two years of National Service, 1951 to 1953, as a Pilot Officer in the Royal Air Force flying Gloster Meteors, he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1956 with honours in English.

While at Cambridge he wrote regularly for the undergraduate newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; and also created a strip cartoon whose hero, &quot;Olly&quot;, reflected student life and became a cult figure. He became editor of &quot;Varsity&quot; in 1956.

After graduating he worked briefly as a reporter for the &quot;Birmingham Gazette&quot;, &quot;Picture Post&quot; and &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot; newspapers and then as a film director for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; programme. In 1958, he married the author Katharine Whitehorn, with whom he was to have two sons.

Lyall lived at 14 Provost Rd, London NW3 and enjoyed sailing on the Thames in his motor cruiser. From 1959 to 1962 he was a newspaper reporter and the aviation correspondent for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;. His first novel, &quot;The Wrong Side of the Sky&quot;, was published in 1961, drawing from his personal experiences in the Libyan Desert and in Greece. It was an immediate success; P.G. Wodehouse said of it, &quot;Terrific: when better novels of suspense are written, lead me to them.&quot; Lyall then left journalism in 1963 to become a full-time author.

Lyall&#x27;s first seven novels in the 1960s and early 1970s were action thrillers with different settings around the world. &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1963) was set in Finnish Lapland. The film rights to &quot;Midnight Plus One&quot; (1965), in which an ex-spy is hired to drive a millionaire to Liechtenstein were purchased by actor Steve McQueen, who had planned to adapt it to the cinema before he died. &quot;Shooting Script&quot; (1966), about a former RAF pilot hired to fly his de Havilland Dove for a filming company, later in the story a B-25 Mitchell, is set around the Caribbean. Whitmore, a central character in the story was inspired by John Wayne whom Lyall had met while reporting on the making of the 1957 film &quot;Legend of the Lost&quot; in Libya. The protagonists of &quot;Judas Country&quot; (1975) are again former RAF pilots, and the setting is now in Cyprus and the Middle East.

Lyall is credited as co-writer (together with Frank Hardman and Martin Davison) of the original story on which the screenplay of the 1969 science-fiction film &quot;Moon Zero Two&quot; is based.

Gavin Lyall was also a wargamer and appeared in &quot;Battleground&quot;, a Tyne Tees television series on miniature war gaming in 1978.

Lyall won the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Silver Dagger award in both 1964 and 1965. In 1966-67 he was Chairman of the British Crime Writers Association. He was not a prolific author, attributing his slow pace to obsession with technical accuracy. According to a British newspaper, &quot;he spent many nights in his kitchen at Primrose Hill, north London, experimenting to see if one could, in fact, cast bullets from lead melted in a saucepan, or whether the muzzle flash of a revolver fired across a saucer of petrol really would ignite a fire&quot;.
He eventually published the results of his research in a series of pamphlets for the Crime Writers&#x27; Association in the 1970s.
Lyall signed a contract in 1964 by the investments group Booker similar to one they had signed with Ian Fleming. In return for a lump payment of £25,000 and an annual salary, they and Lyall subsequently split his royalties, 51–49.

Up to the publication in 1975 of &quot;Judas Country&quot;, Lyall&#x27;s work falls into two groups. The aviation thrillers (&quot;The Wrong Side of the Sky&quot;, &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, &quot;Shooting Script&quot;, and &quot;Judas Country&quot;), and what might be called &quot;Euro-thrillers&quot; revolving around international crime in Europe (&quot;Midnight Plus One&quot;, &quot;Venus With Pistol&quot;, and &quot;Blame The Dead&quot;). All these books were written in the first person, with a sardonic style reminiscent of the &quot;hard-boiled private-eye&quot; genre. Despite the commercial success of his work, Lyall began to feel that he was falling into a predictable pattern, and abandoned both his earlier genres, and the first-person narrative, for his &quot;Harry Maxim&quot; series of espionage thrillers beginning with &quot;The Secret Servant&quot; published in 1980. This book, originally developed for a proposed BBC TV Series, featured Major Harry Maxim, an SAS officer assigned as a security adviser to 10 Downing Street, and was followed by three sequels with the same central cast of characters. In the 1990s Lyall changed literary direction once again, and wrote four semi-historical thrillers about the fledgling British secret service in the years leading up to World War I.

Lyall died of cancer in 2003.

<doc id="756365" wikidata="Q596978" url="?curid=756365" title="Man with No Name">
<text>The Man with No Name () is the antihero character portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; of Italian Spaghetti Western films: &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964), &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966). He is recognizable by his poncho, brown hat, tan cowboy boots, fondness for cigarillos, and the fact that he rarely speaks.

The &quot;Man with No Name&quot; concept was invented by the American distributor United Artists. Eastwood&#x27;s character does have a name, or nickname, which is different in each film: &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Manco&quot; and &quot;Blondie&quot;, respectively.

When Clint Eastwood was honored with the American Film Institute&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, Jim Carrey gave the introductory speech and said: The Man with No Name&#x27; had no name, so we could fill in our own.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; chose the Man with No Name as the 33rd greatest movie character of all time.

==Appearances==
* &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964)
* &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965)
* &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966)

==Concept and creation==
&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was directly adapted from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961). It was the subject of a lawsuit by &quot;Yojimbo&quot;″s producers. &quot;Yojimbo&quot;″s protagonist, an unconventional rōnin (a samurai with no master) played by Toshiro Mifune, bears a striking resemblance to Eastwood&#x27;s character: both are quiet, gruff, eccentric strangers with a strong but unorthodox sense of justice and extraordinary proficiency with a particular weapon (in Mifune&#x27;s case, a katana; in Eastwood&#x27;s, a revolver).

Like Eastwood&#x27;s western setting character, Mifune plays a rōnin with no name. When pressed, he gives the pseudonym &quot;Sanjuro Kuwabatake&quot; (meaning &quot;30-year-old mulberry field&quot;), a reference to his age and something he sees through a window. The convention of hiding the character&#x27;s arms from view is shared as well, with Mifune&#x27;s character typically wearing his arms inside his kimono, leaving the sleeves empty. Prior to signing on to &quot;Fistful&quot;, Eastwood had seen Kurosawa&#x27;s film and was impressed by the character. During filming, he did not emulate Mifune&#x27;s performance beyond what was already in the script. He also insisted on removing some of the dialogue in the original script, making the character more silent and thus adding to his mystery. As the trilogy progressed, the character became even more silent and stoic.

The &quot;Man with No Name&quot; sobriquet was actually applied after the films were made, and was a marketing device used by distributor United Artists to promote the three films together in the United States film market. The prints of the film were physically trimmed to remove all mention of his names.

===Actual names or monikers===
In &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964), he is called &quot;Joe&quot; by the undertaker, Piripero, and Eastwood&#x27;s role is credited as &quot;Joe&quot;.

In &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965), he is called &quot;Manco&quot; (Spanish for &quot;one-armed&quot;; in fact, in the original Italian-language version he is called &quot;il Monco&quot;, a dialectal expression meaning &quot;the One-armed one&quot;), because he does everything left-handed, except for shooting.

In &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966), Tuco calls him &quot;Blondie&quot; (&quot;il Biondo&quot;, meaning &quot;the Blond one&quot;, in Italian) for his light hair. He is also &quot;the Good&quot; (&quot;il Buono&quot;), from which the film receives its name.

In the &quot;Dollars&quot; book series, he is also known as &quot;The Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Bounty Killer&quot;, &quot;Mister Sudden Death&quot;, &quot;Nameless&quot;, &quot;No Name&quot; and &quot;Señor Ninguno&quot;, or its literal translation &quot;Mr. None&quot;.

==Literature==

The popularity of the characters brought about a series of spin-off books, dubbed the &quot;Dollars&quot; series due to the common theme in their titles:

* &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, film novelization by Frank Chandler
* &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, film novelization by Joe Millard
* &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, film novelization by Joe Millard
* &quot;A Coffin Full of Dollars&quot; by Joe Millard
* &quot;A Dollar to Die For&quot; by Brian Fox (a pseudonym for Todhunter Ballard)
* &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dollar Sign&quot; by Joe Millard
* &quot;The Million-Dollar Bloodhunt&quot; by Joe Millard
* &quot;Blood For a Dirty Dollar&quot; by Joe Millard

&quot;A Coffin Full of Dollars&quot; provides some background history; when he was young, The Man with No Name was a ranch hand who was continually persecuted by an older hand named Carvell. The trouble eventually led to a shootout between the two with Carvell being outdrawn and killed; however, an examination of Carvell&#x27;s body revealed a scar which identified him as Monk Carver, a wanted man with a $1,000 bounty. After comparing the received bounty with his $10-a-month ranch pay, the young cowhand chose to change his life and become a bounty hunter.

In July 2007, American comic book company Dynamite Entertainment announced that they were going to begin publishing a comic book featuring the character, titled &quot;The Man with No Name&quot;. Set after the events of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, the comic is written by Christos Gage. Dynamite refers to him as &quot;Blondie&quot;, the nickname Tuco uses for him in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. The first issue was released in March 2008, entitled, &quot;The Man with No Name: The Good, The Bad, and The Uglier&quot;. Luke Lieberman and Matt Wolpert took over the writing for issues #7–11. Initially, Chuck Dixon was scheduled to take over the writing chores with issue #12, but Dynamite ended the series and opted to use Dixon&#x27;s storyline for a new series titled &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot;. The new series is not an adaptation of the movie, despite its title. After releasing eight issues, Dynamite abandoned the series.

==References and homages in other works==

===Animation===
* Flint Shrubwood, the bounty hunter hired by Duke Igthorn in an episode of &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, called &quot;For a Few Sovereigns More&quot;, is a parody of both The Man with No Name and Clint Eastwood.
* An episode of &quot;Time Squad&quot; called &quot;Billy The Baby&quot; features The Man with No Name as a ruthless sheriff chasing the Time Squad, who is teaching Billy the Kid to be a proper bandit.

===Anime and manga===
* Jotaro Kujo, protagonist of Part three of the manga series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot;, was inspired by The Man with No Name. Author Hirohiko Araki met Eastwood in 2012 as part of the series&#x27; 25th anniversary celebration and presented him with an original framed Jotaro Kujo illustration; in return, Eastwood recreated one of the character&#x27;s signature poses of pointing at the viewer. The pose was directly inspired by Eastwood&#x27;s character pointing his gun at the camera.

===Film===
* Boba Fett, an antagonist from George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, was based on the Man with No Name, according to Jeremy Bulloch, the actor who portrayed him, from his mannerisms to his green-on-white armor that has the same colour scheme as the Man&#x27;s poncho.
* Vincent Canby described Fred Williamson&#x27;s character in the blaxploitation film &quot;Boss Nigger&quot; as &quot;an immensely self-assured parody&quot; of the Man with No Name character.
* The 2011 animated Western film &quot;Rango&quot; mentions multiple times a character named &quot;the Spirit of the West&quot;, a mythical figure among the inhabitants of the town of Dirt, who conducts an &quot;alabaster carriage&quot;, protected by &quot;golden guardians&quot;. Near the end of the film, the titular character meets the Spirit (voiced by Timothy Olyphant) who appears to him as what is implied to be an elderly version of either Eastwood or the Man with No Name (although that is not explicitly stated, except for Rango mentioning that was once the Spirit&#x27;s appearance&#x27;s moniker), with the carriage being a golf cart and the guardians being Academy Awards-like statuettes.
* The movie &quot;Willy&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; features the Man with No Name as a drifter, played by Nicolas Cage, who is coerced into a dangerous situation requiring heroic and violent action.
* The movie &quot;Back to the Future II&quot; portrays a scene where the character Biff is watching one of the films. Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character, Marty McFly, would later emulate that same scene Biff was watching in &quot;Back to the Future III&quot;.

===Literature===
* Roland Deschain, the primary protagonist of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; book series, is heavily inspired by the Man with No Name. In &quot;The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah&quot;, King, who appears as a character in the book, makes the comparison when he calls Roland a &quot;fantasy version of Clint Eastwood.&quot;

===Television===
* The title character of the Space Western series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; is partly inspired Eastwood&#x27;s character, both being stoic bounty hunters.
* In the television series &quot;Fallout&quot;, the character known as &quot;The Ghoul&quot; is a gunslinger wandering a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles and is partially inspired by the Man with No Name. In preparation for the role, actor Walton Goggins watched Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;.

===Video games===
* In the 1992 video game &quot;The Town with No Name&quot;, the player character is referred to as &quot;the Man with No Name&quot;. However, his appearance and personality are different from those of the film character, with his voice resembling that of John Wayne. An unnamed man with a cigarette who resembles the original Man with No Name appears as a non-player character.
* Solid Snake, the protagonist of Hideo Kojima&#x27;s video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, was visually based on the Man with No Name.
* A cosmetic item by the name Hat with No Name is available for the Soldier, Demoman, Engineer, and Sniper in &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;.

===Other===
* An Audio-Animatronic version of the character appeared in The Great Movie Ride at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios from 1989 to 2017.

<text>Rose Mary Woods (December 26, 1917 – January 22, 2005) was Richard Nixon&#x27;s secretary from his days in Congress in 1951 through the end of his political career. Before H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman became the operators of Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign, Woods was Nixon&#x27;s gatekeeper.

==Early life and connection to Nixon==
Rose Mary Woods was born in northeastern Ohio in the small pottery town of Sebring on December 26, 1917. Her brother was Joseph I. Woods, a sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, and longtime member of the Cook County Board.

Following graduation from McKinley High School, Woods worked for Royal China, Inc., the city&#x27;s largest employer. She had been engaged to marry, but her fiancé died during World War II. To escape the memories of her hometown, she moved to Washington, D.C. in 1943, working in a variety of federal offices until she met Nixon while she was a secretary to the House Select Committee on Foreign Aid. Impressed by his neatness and efficiency, she accepted his job offer in 1951.

Woods developed a very close relationship with the Nixon family, especially with First Lady Pat Nixon. She accompanied Vice President Nixon on his 1958 goodwill tour of South America but was injured by flying glass in the attack on Nixon&#x27;s motorcade.

==Secretary to the President of the United States==
Woods was President Nixon&#x27;s personal secretary, the same position that she held from the time that he hired her until the end of his lengthy political career.

Fiercely loyal to Nixon, Woods claimed responsibility in a 1974 grand jury testimony for inadvertently erasing up to five minutes of the 18½ minute gap on a June 20, 1972, audio tape. Her demonstration of how this might have occurred, in which she stretched to simultaneously press controls several feet apart (what the press dubbed the &quot;Rose Mary Stretch&quot;), was met with skepticism from those who believed the erasures to be deliberate.

An expert analysis of the tapes conducted in January 1974 revealed that there were four or five separate erasures, and perhaps as many as nine. The contents of the gaps remain unknown.

Accompanying Nixon to San Clemente following his resignation, she later returned to Washington and worked as a secretary to a Republican member of Congress.

==Death==
Woods died on January 22, 2005, at McCrea Manor, a nursing home in Alliance, Ohio, near her hometown. A memorial service was held at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. She had remained unmarried and had no children.

<doc id="756372" wikidata="Q5971000" url="?curid=756372" title="Military Council of National Salvation">
<text>The Military Council of National Salvation (, abbreviated to WRON) was a military junta administering the Polish People&#x27;s Republic during the period of martial law in Poland between 1981 and 1983. It was headed by General and First Secretary of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party Wojciech Jaruzelski. It is also the only military junta to ever take charge of an Eastern Bloc nation, as all other contemporaries were headed by political communists rather than their military counterparts. Depending on the classification of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, Jaruzelski&#x27;s rule (1981-1990) was also either the only one or one of two times in history where a communist nation was led by a career army commander.
The body was created on 13 December 1981, and was dissolved on 22 July 1983. It consisted of 21 members: fifteen generals, one admiral and five colonels. Among the most notable members were generals Wojciech Jaruzelski, Florian Siwicki, Michał Janiszewski and Czesław Kiszczak. One member, Lt. Col. Mirosław Hermaszewski, was included without his consent or knowledge.

In the beginning of 1982, the Citizens&#x27; Committees of National Salvation were formed, composed mostly of PZPR members. In July 1982, they joined the newly formed Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth.

The lettering of the Polish acronym (WRON; meaning a crow in Polish) was immediately picked up by those that the regime sought to repress and widely used in a form of non-violent opposition through jokes. One saying was that &quot;orła wrona nie pokona&quot; (&#x27;the crow won&#x27;t defeat the eagle&#x27;, a white eagle being the national symbol of Poland).

In 2006, the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation accused WRON members of committing a communist crime. On January 12, 2012, the Warsaw District Court upheld the indictment that WRON was an unlawful criminal armed enterprise which was formed and acted in violation of the Polish constitution. According to the court, the conspiratory group consisted of Wojciech Jaruzelski, Czesław Kiszczak, Florian Siwicki and Tadeusz Tuczapski. Only Kiszczak was arraigned and convicted (4 years of imprisonment, halved under the amnesty, 5 years probation) and proceedings against the rest were suspended or discontinued due to poor health or death of the defendants.

<text>Almendra was one of the most important rock groups from Buenos Aires, Argentina in the late 1960s.

Led by guitarist and lyricist Luis Alberto Spinetta, Almendra released between 1968 and 1971 a few singles and two albums – &quot;Almendra&quot; and &quot;Almendra II&quot; – that revolutionized the sound of Argentine rock for the remainder of the 20th century and almost single-handedly changed the way local rock music was perceived by critics and audiences. Widely compared to The Beatles by their local contemporaries, Almendra did not survive the 1960s and the making of a planned rock opera, though all individual members went on to form the backbone of Argentine rock in the 1970s.

==Formation==
Almendra was formed in 1968 after the breakup of three teenage school groups, Los Sbirros, Los Mods and Los Larkins. The initial rehearsals were held at Spinetta&#x27;s house in Belgrano, an upper-middle-class neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. By mid-1968, they met producer Ricardo Kleiman, who signed them to record a single. Kleiman was the owner of the clothing shop &quot;Modart&quot; and ran a radio show, &quot;Modart en la Noche&quot; (&quot;Modart at Night&quot;), that aired the latest international releases of beat and rock music.

On September 20, 1968, &quot;Tema de Pototo&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Para saber cómo es la soledad&quot;) b/w &quot;El mundo entre las manos&quot; was released. &quot;Tema de Pototo&quot; is a beat ballad about a friend they thought was dead. Both sides feature orchestral arrangements by Rodolfo Alchourrón, at the request of the producer. By the end of 1968, &quot;Hoy todo el hielo en la ciudad&quot; (with fuzz guitar work by Edelmiro), reach the stores. The b-side features &quot;Campos verdes&quot; for which a promotional film was made.

Almendra played during the summer at the beginning of 1969 in Mar del Plata, a resort city 400 km south of Buenos Aires. Their debut in Buenos Aires was on 24 March, at the di Tella Institute, the centre of avant-garde 60s culture in Argentina. Almendra spent the rest of the year performing at different venues, until 21 September, first day of Spring and Student&#x27;s Day in Argentina, when they played at the &quot;Pinap Festival&quot;. &quot;Pinap&quot; was a beat magazine, and the Festival was the first major event of Argentine rock.

==First album==

Meanwhile, the group was recording their debut album. An odd event marked the completion of it. Spinetta had drawn an enigmatic face for the cover. Days afterward, the record company claimed that the drawing had been lost, so they were planning to use a photo of the group instead. Obviously upset, the musicians looked for the lost drawing and eventually found it discarded in the garbage. Spinetta had stayed up all night reproducing his original artwork and took it to the record company the following day. The company offered no excuses the second time. The debut album was finally released on 29 November 1969. Along with the famous drawing, it included an insert with lyrics and technical information. The black and white back cover pictured the group live at the Pinap Festival.

By the end of 1969 the record company released a new single featuring &quot;Tema de Pototo&quot; and &quot;Final&quot;. The latter was originally scheduled to end their debut album, but could not make it due to time length limitations. The group wanted &quot;Gabinetes espaciales&quot; to be the a-side of this single but RCA wished to promote &quot;Pototo&quot; instead. &quot;Gabinetes espaciales&quot; was eventually included on the compilation LP &quot;Mis conjuntos preferidos&quot; (RCA Vik 3836).

In early 1970 another single was released with two songs from the album. Meanwhile, Spinetta was working on a highly ambitious project: a rock opera about humanity&#x27;s inner search. But while they were working on this new album the group split.

==Double album==
On 19 December 1970, &quot;Almendra II&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Almendra double album&quot;) was released, along with a new single taken from it. The 2-LP set included only traces of the unfinished opera but was full of songs that previewed what the members of the group (especially Emilio and Edelmiro) would do next. Although Spinetta was the main composer of the first album and most of the singles, it was clear that his fellow musicians had their own ideas as well.

Side A begins with &quot;Toma el tren hacia el sur&quot; featuring an Edelmiro guitar solo. Next to the short and simple &quot;Jingle&quot;, a Molinari guitar composition (&quot;No tengo idea&quot;) follows. &quot;Camino difícil&quot;, was written by Emilio. The steady rock of &quot;Rutas Argentinas&quot; (a popular song on live shows), the dark &quot;Vete de mí, cuervo negro&quot;, and two more Molinari compositions: &quot;Aire de amor&quot; (prefiguring the style of &quot;Color Humano&quot;) and &quot;Mestizo&quot; complete this side. Side B features the 14-minutes-long &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; and &quot;Para ir&quot;. Side C includes &quot;Parvas&quot;, &quot;Cometa azul&quot;, &quot;Florecen los nardos&quot; and Del Güercio&#x27;s rhythm ballad &quot;Carmen&quot;. Side D begins with &quot;Obertura&quot; (obviously the ill-fated opera&#x27;s overture), followed by the country-folk &quot;Amor de aire&quot; and &quot;Verde llano&quot; (both written by Edelmiro). This last side continues with &quot;Leves instrucciones&quot;, sung by Emilio &amp; Luis Alberto and &quot;Los elefantes&quot;. &quot;Un pájaro te sostiene&quot;—a rock number written by Del Güercio—and Spinetta&#x27;s guitar oriented &quot;En las cúpulas&quot; close the album.

==Aftermath==
Almendra&#x27;s split produced the bands Aquelarre, Color Humano, and Pescado Rabioso.

Years later, on 7 and 8 December 1979, Almendra reunited to play live at the Obras Sanitarias Stadium in Buenos Aires. These highly successful shows led to a big tour including various cities of Argentina and Uruguay. A 2-set live album—&quot;Almendra en Obras&quot; (Almendra ML 712 &amp; 713), and a studio album of new material—&quot;El valle interior&quot; (Almendra ML 135)—were also released, this time on their own independent label.

Some notable compilations are 1972&#x27;s &quot;Almendra&quot; (series Rock Progresivo) (RCA Vik LZ-1227) and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Muchacha, ojos de papel&quot; (RCA AVS-4765). Both include singles. A rare 4-song EP with PS (RCA Vik 3ZE-3704) also exists. Also, a now rare book titled &quot;Almendra&quot;, featuring poems and drawings was published in 1970. All records were re-issued on CD. [Note: CD &quot;Cronología 1&quot; includes the first RCA album plus all the singles and CD &quot;Cronología 2&quot;—now out of print—includes all the songs of the second album in chronological recording order, except the songs released as singles (since they are already included on &quot;Cronología 1&quot;). This way, these 2 CDs feature the Complete Almendra recordings on RCA. Also, the double RCA second album was later released as a 2-CD set with its complete original running order. BMG released a 4-CD Box with all their studio recordings.

On 4 December 2009 Almendra reunited for five songs —&quot;Color humano&quot;, &quot;Fermín&quot;, &quot;A estos hombres tristes&quot;, &quot;Hermano Perro&quot; and &quot;Muchacha (Ojos de papel)&quot;— as part of the &quot;Spinetta y las Bandas Eternas&quot; (Spinetta and The Eternal Bands) concert in the Vélez Sarsfield Stadium in Buenos Aires.

Luis Alberto Spinetta died from lung cancer at the age of 62 on 8 February 2012. On 4 May 2021, the band&#x27;s former drummer, Rodolfo García, died at the age of 75 from a stroke.

<text>Joan Coromines i Vigneaux (; also frequently spelled &quot;Joan Corominas&quot;; Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain 1905 – Pineda de Mar, Catalonia, Spain, 1997) was a linguist who made important contributions to the study of Catalan, Spanish, and other Romance languages.

His main works are the &quot;Diccionario crítico etimológico de la lengua castellana&quot; (1954–1957), in four volumes, first version of his etymological dictionary of Spanish (with an abridged version, &quot;Breve diccionario etimológico de la lengua castellana&quot;, first published in 1961); the &quot;Diccionari etimològic i complementari de la llengua catalana&quot;, which investigates the origin of most words in the Catalan language (9 volumes); the &quot;Onomasticon Cataloniae&quot;, documenting place and person names, old and new, in all the Catalan-speaking territories (8 volumes); and, with José Antonio Pascual, the &quot;Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico&quot;, the most thorough etymological dictionary of Spanish extant today. Following this research, he—along with Koldo Mitxelena—made key contributions to the study of the Basque language&#x27;s geographical extent across the Pyrenees during the early Middle Ages.

Coromines studied at the University of Barcelona, and started working on linguistics from an early age. At the same time, he held strongly Catalanist convictions all his life. He was forced into exile after the Spanish Civil War, eventually holding a professorship at the University of Chicago, in 1948. He returned to Catalonia later, and spent the rest of his life working on his main works: the etymological dictionaries and the &quot;Onomasticon&quot;.

He refused several prizes from the Spanish government, in protest at the treatment of the Catalan language and culture in Spain.

In honor of Coromines, in April 2006 the University of Chicago inaugurated the &quot;Càtedra Joan Coromines d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot;, a teaching chair for visiting professors of Catalan language and literature.

<text>Turkish music, in the sense described here, is not the music of Turkey, but rather a musical style that was occasionally used by the European composers of the Classical music era. This music was modelled—though often only distantly—on the music of Turkish military bands, specifically the Janissary bands.

==History==

An important impetus for Turkish music occurred in 1699, when Austria and the Ottoman Empire negotiated the Treaty of Karlowitz. To celebrate the treaty, the Turkish diplomatic delegation brought a Janissary band along with other performers to Vienna for several days of performances.

Although the Janissary sound was familiar in Europe during the 18th century, the Classical composers were not the first to make use of it; rather, the first imitators were military bands. The cultural influence at first involved actual importation of Turkish musicians, as Henry George Farmer relates:

:The credit for having introduced this battery of percussion and concussion into Europe usually goes to Poland which, in the 1720s, had received a full Turkish band from the Sultan. Russia, not to be outdone, sought a similar favour of the Sublime Porte in 1725, Prussia and Austria following suit, and by the 1770s most other countries had fallen under the sway of Janissary Music.

The importation of actual musicians was only a temporary phenomenon, and the later custom was to assign the Turkish instruments in European military bands to other performers.

Thus, Turkish music in Europe had two connotations—Eastern and military—for 17th- and 18th-century European composers. The Turkish association did not evaporate soon. Even during the 1820s, in planning the last movement of the Ninth Symphony, Beethoven made a note to himself specifically stating that it would contain &quot;Turkish&quot; music. The use of the slang term &quot;Turkish section&quot; to describe the percussion section of an orchestra apparently persisted into modern times.

Eventually it became possible to write music with bass drum, triangle, cymbals, and piccolo without evoking a Turkish atmosphere, and in the later 19th century symphonic composers made free use of these instruments. Thus, in the long run, the Turkish instruments are a gift to Western classical music from the Ottoman military music tradition.

==Description==

Turkish music (in the sense just given) is always lively in tempo and is almost always a kind of march.

When Turkish music was scored for orchestra, it normally used extra percussion instruments not otherwise found in orchestras of the time: typically, the bass drum, the triangle, and cymbals. These instruments were used by Ottoman Turks in their military music, so at least the instrumentation of &quot;Turkish&quot; music was authentic except for the triangle. Often there is also a piccolo, whose piercing tone recalls the shrill sound of the zurna (shawm) of Ottoman Janissary music.

It seems that at least part of the entertainment value of &quot;Turkish&quot; music was the perceived exoticism. The Turks were well known to the citizens of Vienna (where Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven all worked) as military opponents, and indeed the centuries of warfare between Austria and Ottoman Empire had only started going generally in Austria&#x27;s favor around the late 17th century. The differences in culture, as well as the frisson derived from the many earlier Turkish invasions, apparently gave rise to a fascination among the Viennese for all things Turkish—or even ersatz Turkish. This was part of a general trend in European arts at the time; see Turquerie.

==Examples==
All three of the great Classical era composers, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, wrote Turkish music. For sound files illustrating some of these works, see the &quot;External links&quot; section below.

===Haydn===

*Haydn&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;incontro improvviso&quot; (&quot;The Unforeseen Encounter&quot;, 1775) is somewhat similar in its subject to Mozart&#x27;s later &quot;Abduction from the Seraglio&quot; and also includes &quot;Turkish&quot; music, for instance the overture.
*Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Military Symphony&quot; (1794) uses &quot;Turkish&quot; music in both the second movement (which depicts a battle) and in a brief reprise at the end of the finale.
:Haydn had a somewhat remote personal connection to the Turkish army — his paternal grandparents had been living in Hainburg when it was destroyed by the Turks during the invasion of 1683; unlike most of the citizens of Hainburg, they survived the attack.

===Mozart===

*Mozart&#x27;s 1782 opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (&quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;) is the quintessential work of Turkish music, as the whole plot centers on the stereotyping of comically sinister Turks. (The Pasha, at least, turns out noble and generous in the end.) The overture to the opera as well as two marches for the Janissary chorus are Turkish music in the sense just described. This and other contemporaneous operas were so influenced by the Turkish fashion they earned the popular name &quot;Turkish opera.&quot;
*The Piano Sonata in A, K. 331 (1783) ends with the famous rondo marked &quot;Alla Turca&quot;. Repeated notes, repeated ornaments, and loud/soft passages are characteristic of the Turkish style. The imitation probably came closer with the piano of Mozart&#x27;s day, whose bass strings made something of a rattle when played loudly, than is possible on modern pianos.
*The finale of the Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major K. 219 (1775), sometimes called the &quot;Turkish&quot; Concerto, is interrupted by a loud episode of Turkish music. Mozart adapted this passage from an earlier ballet, &quot;Le gelosie del seraglio&quot; (&quot;The Jealous Seraglio Women&quot;) K. 135a, composed for Milan in 1772. In the concerto, the cellos and double basses add to the percussive effect by playing their instruments &quot;coll&#x27; arco al roverscio&quot;, that is to say, &quot;col legno&quot;, striking the strings with the wood of the bow.

===Beethoven===

*In 1811, Beethoven wrote an overture and incidental music to a play by August von Kotzebue called &quot;The Ruins of Athens&quot;, premiered in Pest in 1812. One item from the incidental music (Op. 113, No. 4) is the Turkish march. Beethoven also wrote a set of variations on his march for piano, Op. 76.
*Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot; (1813) commemorates the British victory in the Battle of Vitoria. The opposing British and French armies march to battle with Turkish music versions of their respective battle songs, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; and &quot;Malbrouk s&#x27;en va-t-en guerre&quot;.
*Beethoven returned again to Turkish music, by this time rather out of vogue, in a passage of the final movement of his Ninth Symphony (1824). A tenor soloist, assisted by the tenors and basses of the chorus, sings a florid variation on the famous theme, accompanied by Turkish instruments playing pianissimo (&quot;Froh! Froh, wie seine Sonnen, seine Sonnen fliegen...&quot;).

===Others===

Turkish music also appears in works of Jean-Philippe Rameau, Michael Haydn (Marcia turchesca, MH 601), Gioacchino Rossini, Ludwig Spohr, in two operas of Gluck – &quot;Die Pilger von Mekka&quot; (1764) and &quot;Iphigenie auf Tauris&quot; (1779) – and in Symphony No. 6 in A minor (&quot;Sinfonie turque&quot;) by Friedrich Witt (1770–1836). Paul Wranitzky, who in his lifetime was one of Vienna&#x27;s most famed composers also wrote Turkish influenced music, including a large-scale symphony. Franz Xaver Süssmayr, best known for completing Mozart&#x27;s unfinished &quot;Requiem&quot;, also composed several Turkish works, including operas and symphonies (his &quot;Sinfonia turchesca&quot; for example). Other composers who have written excellent examples of Turkish music include Joseph Martin Kraus, Ferdinand Kauer, Carel Anton Fodor (&quot;Rondo alla turque&quot; from his concerto for keyboard Op. 12) and Ferdinando Paer.

==Musical characteristics==

In Turkish music, the percussion instruments often play this rhythm:

: &lt;score&gt;
\new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 c4 r c r c c c r \bar &quot;||&quot;
&lt;/score&gt;

This is the same rhythm as the marching cadence of soldiers: &quot;Left ... left ... left, right, left ...&quot;

The melodic instruments in Turkish music often emphasize the rhythm by playing grace notes, either singly or several in succession, on the beat.

Both characteristics just mentioned can be seen in the following extract of Turkish music in the Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 5:



The military rhythm and grace notes are also seen in left hand part for this passage from the Turkish music in Mozart&#x27;s K. 331 piano sonata, mentioned above:

The role of Turkish music in a larger work seems to be to serve as a form of musical relaxation. Thus, in the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, the Turkish march serves as a period of lowered intensity between two more massive and emotionally charged sections. Turkish music commonly is found in finales, which (as Charles Rosen point out) are typically the most relaxed and loosely organized movements of Classical works.

==The &quot;Turkish stop&quot; on early pianos==

Around the turn of the 19th century, &quot;Turkish&quot; music was so popular that piano manufacturers made special pianos with a &quot;Turkish stop,&quot; also called the &quot;military&quot; or &quot;Janissary&quot; stop. The player would press a pedal that caused a bell to ring and/or a padded hammer to strike the soundboard in imitation of a bass drum. The sound file for the first musical example above attempts to mimic the latter effect manually with a modern piano.

According to Edwin M. Good, the Turkish stop was popular for playing the Mozart K. 331 rondo, and &quot;many were the pianists who gleefully used the Janissary stop to embellish it.&quot;

<text>Kim Mikael Källström (; born 24 August 1982) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He was noted for his play-making ability and free-kick taking.

He started his career at several clubs in Sweden, winning consecutive Allsvenskan titles with Djurgården before moving to France where he represented Rennes and Lyon. Källström won a range of domestic honours with Lyon and joined Spartak Moscow in 2012. He spent the second half of the 2013–14 season on loan at Arsenal, where he won the 2013–14 FA Cup after converting a penalty in the semifinal. Källström left Spartak in 2015 to join Grasshoppers, where he had a 49 game long spell before ending his career at Djurgårdens IF together with close friend Andreas Isaksson.

Källström earned 131 caps for Sweden since his debut in 2001 until 2016 when he announced his departure from international football, making him their fourth most capped player of all time. He played in four European Championships (Euro 2004, Euro 2008, Euro 2012, and Euro 2016) and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life==
Källström was born in Sandviken 24 August 1982 to footballer Mikael and Ann Källström. In 1986, he joined the local Sandvikens IF football team. In 1989, the family moved to Partille outside Gothenburg and Källström started to play for the local club Partille IF. When Källström was 17 years old he had a trial with Dutch club PSV.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Källström began his professional career with BK Häcken from Gothenburg. In his first season, the club gained promotion the Allsvenskan by winning the Division 1 Södra. Häcken were relegated to the Superettan in 2001, but Källström&#x27;s eight Allsvenskan goals earned him a transfer to Djurgårdens IF for SEK5m.

===Djurgårdens IF===
In his first season at Djurgården, Källström won the double of the Allsvenskan and the national cup tournament Svenska Cupen, and was the team&#x27;s top scorer with twelve league goals. The team defended its Allsvenskan title in 2003, with Källström&#x27;s 14 goals making him the team&#x27;s top goalscorer and the second-highest goalscorer in Sweden.

He scored twice during the 2002–03 UEFA Cup, in fixtures against Shamrock Rovers and Copenhagen.

===Rennes===
In the January 2004 transfer window, Källström moved to the French Ligue 1 club Rennes. He made his debut for the club in the Coupe de France against Angers on 4 January and his first Ligue 1 appearance in a 2–0 defeat at Toulouse on 10 January. A week later, he scored his first goal in French football during a 4–0 win over Sochaux at the Route de Lorient. He ended the 2003–04 season with seven goals from 18 appearances, including two in a 4–1 away win against Champions League finalists Monaco.

During the 2004–05 season, Källström scored five times in 31 Ligue 1 matches to help Rennes finish fourth and qualify for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. On 5 February 2005, he received his first red card in French football in a 3–1 defeat at Marseille.

In 2005–06, he scored a career-best eight Ligue 1 goals, many of which came in fixtures against some of the biggest clubs in France. In June 2006, Rennes accepted a bid of around €8 million for the player from league champions Lyon.

Källström ended his two-and-a-half-year spell at Rennes with 20 goals from 83 league appearances.

===Lyon===
After a successful spell at Rennes, Källström signed for Lyon in June 2006, and went on to win a number of honours with the southern club.

His Lyon debut saw him score the equalising goal as &quot;les Gones&quot; won the Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain on penalties. Five days later, he made his league debut against Nantes in a 3–1 win.

On 17 October 2006, Källström scored his first Lyon goal in a 3–0 win against Dynamo Kyiv in Champions League. After ending the group stage unbeaten – including a defeat of nine times champions Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland – Lyon were knocked out in the round-of-16 by Roma.

On 22 October, Källström scored his first Ligue 1 goal for the club in a 4–1 &quot;Choc des Olympiques&quot; derby defeat of Marseille at the Stade Vélodrome. He scored further goals in league wins against Saint-Étienne and Nancy as Lyon won the French championship for the sixth consecutive season.

On 31 March 2008, he appeared as a 68th-minute substitute as Lyon were beaten 1–0 by Bordeaux in the 2008 Coupe de la Ligue Final.

The 2007–08 season began with Valencia rumoured to be interested in signing Källström from Lyon, who wanted to keep the player despite the €13 million offer. Källström remained at Lyon and, in the second round of the Ligue 1 season, was sent off after spitting towards a linesman during a 1–0 loss at Toulouse.

On 29 September 2007, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 victory against Lens. A week later, he scored again in a 3–1 win at Bordeaux. On 8 November, he scored in a 4–2 Champions League defeat of VfB Stuttgart. However, Lyon were again knocked out in the round-of-16, losing to eventual winners Manchester United 2–1 on aggregate in March 2008.

On 2 December 2007, Källström scored two goals and assisted another as Lyon beat Strasbourg 5–0 at the Gerland. On the final day of the league season, Källström scored in a 3–1 win at Auxerre to secure a seventh league title. On 28 May 2008, he started in the 2008 Coupe de France Final as Lyon completed the club&#x27;s first league and cup double with a 1–0 win against Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade de France.

On 16 November 2008, Källström scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season in a 2–1 win over championship rivals Bordeaux to put Lyon seven points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table. His only other goal came in a 1–1 draw with his former club Rennes on 1 March 2009. Poor late season form saw OL slip to third in the table, with Bordeaux winning the championship on the final day of the season.

Källström scored four goals in Ligue 1 during the 2009–10 season. His first goal came in a 2–0 win against Lens on 3 October 2009. On 20 January 2010, he scored twice in a 3–1 win at Lorient. His final goal was scored in a 2–2 draw with Valenciennes on the penultimate matchday of the season.

On 8 November 2009, he started in a 5–5 &quot;Choc des Olympiques&quot; draw with Marseille. OM went on to win the league title, with Lyon six points behind in second place.

The 2009–10 Champions League saw Lyon have the club&#x27;s most successful season in the competition. Källström scored in a 4–0 win at Hungarian champions Debreceni and made eleven appearances overall, helping &quot;les Gones&quot; reach the semi-finals where they lost to Bayern Munich.

During 2010–11, Källström occasionally provided cover at left-back, in addition to his favoured midfield role. He scored three goals in Ligue 1, including the equaliser against eventual champions Lille in a 1–1 draw.

The 2011–12 season was Källström&#x27;s last at the club. He made 32 appearances in Ligue 1 without scoring.

In the Coupe de France, he scored one goal and assisted another as Lyon knocked out Paris Saint-Germain with a 3–1 win at the Parc des Princes at the quarter-final stage. A 4–0 win against Ajaccio in the semi-finals put OL into the 2012 Coupe de France Final, where Källström played the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win over Quevilly. Lyon also reached the final of the 2011–12 Coupe de la Ligue, with Källstrom scoring in the quarter-final defeat of Lille. However, Lyon&#x27;s chances of a cup double were ended by a 1–0 extra time defeat by Marseille.

In August 2012, Källström left Lyon after six seasons. Overall, he made 283 appearances for the club, winning two Ligue 1 titles, two Coupes de France and two Trophées des Champions. He was also a runner-up in the Coupe de la Ligue on two occasions.

===Spartak Moscow===
On 28 July 2012, it was announced that Källström had signed with Spartak Moscow for €3 million plus €600,000 in potential add-ons. On 15 September, he made his Russian Premier League debut in a 2–2 draw with Kuban Krasnodar. On 29 September, he scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 against Amkar Perm.

He played in all of Spartak&#x27;s 2012–13 UEFA Champions League group matches, receiving a red card in a 2–1 defeat at Celtic on 5 December 2012.

====Loan to Arsenal====
On 31 January 2014, Källström joined Arsenal on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season. Although a back injury was discovered during his medical, it was decided Källström would still join and undergo his rehabilitation at Arsenal. Källström made his debut for Arsenal on 25 March against Swansea City in the Premier League, coming on in the 79th minute as a substitute for Tomáš Rosický. His next appearance came two weeks later in the FA Cup semi-finals against defending champions Wigan Athletic. Introduced as an extra-time substitute, he scored Arsenal&#x27;s second spot kick in their 4–2 penalty shoot-out win which saw them advance to the final. Källström has gone on to describe this moment as &quot;the greatest 15 minutes of my life.&quot; Three days later, he made his first start for Arsenal in a 3–1 victory against West Ham United. Arsenal went on to win the FA Cup; Källström was not in the match day squad for the final. After making four appearances in all competitions, it was announced that Källström would not return to Arsenal once his loan spell with them expired at the end of the season. Despite only making four appearances, Källström said he enjoyed his time at Arsenal.

===Grasshoppers===
After three years in Russia, Källström left Spartak and signed for Swiss Super League club Grasshoppers on 6 June 2015. He scored his only goal for the club on 29 November 2015, the final goal in a 5–0 win against city rivals FC Zürich. Källström was also named captain upon his arrival at the side. After one and a half years, Källström wanted to leave Grasshoppers, citing personal reasons and dissatisfaction with the club&#x27;s results. He subsequently ended his contract with the club by mutual consent on 31 January 2017.

===Return to Djurgårdens IF and retirement===
On 10 February, Källström returned to Djurgårdens IF in Allsvenskan, signing a two-year deal with the club. Källström was immediately handed his old number 16. The club&#x27;s announcement of signing Källström lead to a crash of the official website of Djurgården, dif.se, due to the number of visitors on the website. After playing 28 league games in 2017, scoring three goals and providing seven assists, Källström announced his retirement from football on 15 December that year.

==International career==

Källström made his international debut in 2001 against Finland. He made the Swedish squad for the UEFA Euro 2004, 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, and UEFA Euro 2012 tournaments.
He also scored Sweden&#x27;s first goal in the 3–2 win over the Netherlands to take the &quot;Blågult&quot; to Euro 2012.

In a 2014 World Cup qualifier against Germany on 16 October 2012, Källström was brought on as a substitute for Pontus Wernbloom at half time with Sweden losing 3–0. Despite conceding another goal, with three assists from him, Sweden earned a 4–4 draw.

In the return match against Germany, Källström comforted Max, a team mascot who suffers from Williams Syndrome, and a photo of this went viral on social media. Max&#x27;s father Emil wrote to Källström, expressing his thanks. He said: &quot;Because of your actions, Kim, my son could experience precisely the same emotions as everyone else who has been a mascot: pride, a sense of being special, &#x27;I did it&#x27; and an immense joy.&quot;

Källström retired from the national team after Euro 2016, having amassed 131 caps, scoring 16 goals. He is Sweden&#x27;s fourth most capped player.

==Playing style==
A central midfielder who could also play on the left side of midfield as a wide midfielder, Källström had the potential to work as a deep-lying playmaker or as a more attacking influence. He was also known for his left-footed free kick ability.

<text>Adolfo Domingo De Guzmán Luque (August 4, 1890 – July 3, 1957) was a Cuban starting pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to . He spent 12 seasons of his career (1918–1929) with the Cincinnati Reds. Luque was not only the first Latin American pitcher in MLB, but also the first to earn a World Series win (in 1919), and the first to lead the majors in wins, shutouts and earned run average (ERA).

A native of Havana, Luque played winter baseball in the Cuban League from 1912 to 1945 and was also a long-time manager in the league, leading Almendares to eight championships over 19 seasons. Along with his contemporary Miguel Ángel González, he is considered one of the best Cuban baseball managers of all time. Additionally, he managed in the Mexican League in all or parts of eight seasons spanning 1946–1956.

Luque was enshrined in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1957 and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1967, as well as in the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

== Playing career ==
Luque made his professional debut in Cuba for the Habana baseball club against a Major League opponent, the Philadelphia Phillies, in an exhibition series in the fall of 1911. He left the game after 8 innings with his team ahead 6–5, but his reliever failed to hold the lead and left Luque with a no decision. He then pitched against the New York Giants, going 1–2, getting the only win for Habana in six games. He debuted in the Cuban League in the winter of 1912, but went 0–4, 0–2, and 2–4 his first three seasons. In 1914/15 he moved to Almendares and had his first winning season, going 7–4. The following season he led the league in wins with a 12–5 record. The next winter, 1917, he tied for the league lead in wins and also led in hitting with a .355 average.

Luque made his major league debut with the Boston Braves in 1914. In 1918, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, with whom he played the next 12 seasons. In the notorious 1919 World Series, he appeared in two games as a relief pitcher. Luque also played for the Brooklyn Robins/Dodgers from 1930 to 1931 and with the New York Giants from 1932 to 1935. He was with the Giants in the 1933 World Series, and, pitching in relief, won the fifth and final game over the Washington Senators, thus becoming (at age 43) the oldest pitcher ever to win a World Series game. He ended his career with a record of 194–179 and a 3.24 ERA.

Luque was an above average hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .227 batting average (237-for-1043) with 96 runs, 5 home runs and 90 RBI. He also drew 70 bases on balls.

Luque became a starting pitcher in 1920. Primarily pitching with a curveball, he led the National League in losses in 1922, then had his best year in 1923, leading the league with 27 wins and an ERA of 1.93. Luque also led the NL in ERA with a 2.63 in 1925. He was known as an adept mentor in the later years of his pitching career, and went on to become the pitching coach of the Giants from 1936 to 1938 and 1942 to 45.

As a blue-eyed, fair-skinned, white Cuban, he was one of several white Cubans to make it in Major League Baseball at a time when non-whites were excluded. Between 1911 and 1929 alone, seventeen Cuban-born Caucasian players played in the Major Leagues. Many of them, including Luque, also played Negro league baseball with integrated teams from Cuba. Luque played for Cuban Stars in 1912 and the Long Branch Cubans in 1913 before signing with organized baseball.

Luque was known to have a temper. While with the Brooklyn Dodgers, a heckler in the stands hollered &quot;Lucky Luque! Lucky Luque!&quot; repeatedly. Luque went over to the dugout and told manager Wilbert Robinson, &quot;I tell you, Robbie, if this guy don&#x27;t shut up, I&#x27;m gonna shut him up.&quot; &quot;Aw, come on, Dolf&quot;, said the manager. &quot;He paid his way in—let him boo.&quot; Just then the heckler spotted the rotund Robinson and yelled, &quot;Hey, fat belly!&quot; Robinson said, &quot;OK, Dolf—go ahead and clobber the jerk.&quot; Luque obliged his manager&#x27;s request.

Luque also served as a coach at the major league level for seven seasons (1936–1937; 1941–1945) with the New York Giants, working under managers Bill Terry and Mel Ott. As a coach, Luque was a member of the Giants&#x27; and National League champion teams.

== Managerial career ==
Luque managed in the Mexican League for the Pericos de Puebla (1946–1947), Azules de Veracruz (1948), Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo (1953–1955) and Leones de Yucatán (1956). Besides, he managed the 1951 Habana Cubans of the Florida International League sandwiched between two stints with the Águilas de Mexicali in 1950 (Sunset League) and 1952 (Southwest International League).

=== Cuba ===
Luque was the only manager to head each of the “big four” teams in the Cuban League; though the bulk of his career was spent with Almendares, he also managed Habana for three seasons (1924, 1955, 1956) and spent one season with Cienfuegos (which he led to a title in 1946) and Marianao.

In 1919/20 Luque became a playing manager for Almendares and led the team to a championship in his first season at the helm, the first of seven championships as a manager. He contributed on the pitching mound with a 10–4 record, leading the league in wins. In 1922/23 he moved to Habana (where Miguel Angel González was manager) and again led the league in wins with an 11–9 record. The next season, he took over the helm as Habana&#x27;s manager and went 7–2 as a pitcher. Later in the decade, Luque&#x27;s Major League team, the Cincinnati Reds, did not allow him to play winter baseball in Cuba. Luque sometimes evaded the ban by playing under assumed names.
By the 1930s, Luque had returned to Almendares as manager. He generally pitched only occasionally, though in 1934/35 he contributed as a pitcher to his second championship as a manager; he tied for the league lead in wins with a 6–2 record and led the league with a 1.27 ERA. As manager, he again led Almendares to championships in 1939/40, 1941/42, and 1942/43, led Cienfuegos to a championship in 1945/46, and returned to Almendares for his final championship in 1946/47. He continued to manage for various teams until 1955/56.

Luque&#x27;s career Cuban League pitching record was 106–71. Luque is the all-time Cuban League leader in years pitching with 22, ranking second behind Martín Dihigo in wins with 106, and seventh in winning percentage with .599.

== Legacy ==
Luque is mentioned in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, when Hemingway writes &quot;Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?.&quot;

Luque died July 3, 1957, and is buried at Colon Cemetery, Havana.

<text>Christian Ulf &quot;Chippen&quot; Wilhelmsson (; born 8 December 1979) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a winger. Beginning his career with Mjällby AIF in 1997, he went on to represent clubs in Norway, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, England, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Qatar before retiring at Mjällby in 2015. Wilhelmsson won 79 caps for the Sweden national team between 2001 and 2012, and represented his country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and at Euro 2004, 2008, and 2012. 

==Club career==

===Early years and Anderlecht===
Born in Malmö, Wilhelmsson started his career with Mjällby AIF in 1997, playing in three second division seasons with the club. He then spent as many years in neighbouring Norway with Stabæk Fotball.

In the 2003 summer Wilhelmsson joined R.S.C. Anderlecht in Belgium, being an undisputed starter during his spell and scoring nine top division goals combined in the capital side&#x27;s 2004 and 2006 league conquests.

===Nantes===
In 2006, Wilhelmsson moved to the French Ligue 1 team FC Nantes.

==== Loan to Roma ====
However, on 10 January of the following year, he joined A.S. Roma on loan until the end of the season, when the Italians had the option to buy for €3 million. He made his Serie A debut on 14 January against FC Messina, Roma did not take advantage of its option to buy and Wilhelmsson returned to Nantes after the season and immediately starting seeking a new club following the Canaries&#x27; relegation from Ligue 1.

==== Loan to Bolton Wanderers ====
Following speculation about a move to various Premier League clubs or Scottish club Celtic, he signed for Bolton Wanderers on a 12-month loan, with an option to make the deal permanent after 20 games. He made 13 appearances all competitions comprised, mostly as a substitute, his debut coming in a 1–3 away defeat against Portsmouth. Wilhelmsson was instrumental in closing the club&#x27;s signing of countryman Johan Elmander for a record transfer fee, for 2008–09.

==== Loan to Deportivo La Coruña ====
He was again loaned by Nantes, this time moving to Spain and Deportivo de La Coruña on 30 January 2008. He played his first La Liga match against Getafe CF, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 home draw, and made his first start two rounds later, in a home fixture match against RCD Espanyol (2–0 home win). Wilhelmsson scored his first goal for &quot;Depor&quot; on 1 March 2008, in a 2–1 home win against Sevilla FC, and finished the campaign firmly established in the side&#x27;s starting XI – he would start in 13 of his league appearances – as the Galicians eventually finished ninth and qualified to the UEFA Intertoto Cup.

=== Al-Hilal ===
In 2008, Wilhelmsson signed a three-year contract with Saudi club Al-Hilal FC for about €9 million. He helped the club win the league title in his second year, scoring nine goals and making ten assists in 20 appearances; for his contributions he received the Player of the Season award, going on to win four additional major titles during his tenure, including two consecutive Saudi Crown Prince Cup where he scored in both finals.

==== Loan to Al Ahli ====
Wilhelmsson spent the first half of 2011–12 on loan with Qatar&#x27;s Al Ahli SC.
===LA Galaxy===
Wilhelmsson was announced as a LA Galaxy player on 5 September 2012. He scored in his Major League Soccer debut nine days later, in a 2–0 win against the Colorado Rapids.

===Baniyas===
On 14 January 2013, Wilhelmsson signed a one-and-a-half-year deal with Baniyas SC.

=== Return to Mjällby AIF and retirement ===
Wilhelmsson signed for Mjällby AIF and made his Allsvenskan debut during the 2014 Allsvenskan season at the age of 34. After a short spell with former club Mjällby, he officially announced his retirement. However, in August 2015, he came out of retirement to help the latter team retain their status in the Superettan, which was eventually not achieved.

==International career==
Gaining his first cap in 2001, Wilhelmsson represented Sweden at UEFA Euro 2004, Euro 2008, Euro 2012 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, featuring in every one of the national team&#x27;s four games in the latter tournament and starting in two.

On 4 September 2006 he was one of three international players sent home for breaking a curfew during a night out, the other two being Olof Mellberg and Zlatan Ibrahimović. In March 2011, he was involved in a training ground scuffle with the latter.

Wilhelmsson scored his first brace for Sweden in a Euro 2012 qualifier against San Marino on 6 September 2011 (5–0 away win), for his seventh and eighth international goals. He was also selected for the finals in Poland and Ukraine by manager Erik Hamren, collecting three bench appearances in an eventual group stage exit.

==Personal life==
Wilhelmsson married Russian-born model Oksana Andersson in May 2010, in Las Vegas. Aside from Swedish, he also speaks fluent English.

<text>Horace Harmon Lurton (February 26, 1844 – July 12, 1914) was a Confederate soldier and later, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Early life==

Lurton was born on February 26, 1844, in Newport, Kentucky. He attended the Old University of Chicago, then received a Bachelor of Laws in 1867 from Cumberland School of Law (then part of Cumberland University, now part of Samford University).

He served in the Confederate States Army as a Sergeant Major with the 5th Tennessee Infantry at the age of 17, left for ill health, and later served as a private in the 2nd Kentucky Infantry and 3rd Kentucky Cavalry from 1862 to 1865. He was twice captured by Union forces, the second time sent as a prisoner of war to Johnson&#x27;s Island Prison Camp in Sandusky Bay, Ohio. He claimed he was later paroled by President Lincoln because of pleas for mercy from his mother but this was merely an anecdote he often repeated to dinner guests, according to historian Roger Long. Mr. Long explains in detail what the evidence shows in an article he wrote in the December 1994 edition of Civil War Times. According to Mr. Long, apparently he was paroled from Johnson&#x27;s Island only when he signed the oath of allegiance, not because of any act of the president. Mr Long&#x27;s article includes interesting details about Lurton&#x27;s service as well as possible reasons for the anecdote he was so fond of repeating.

He entered private practice in Clarksville, Tennessee from 1867 to 1875. He was Chancellor for the Tennessee Chancery Court for the Sixth Judicial District from 1875 to 1878. He resumed private practice in Clarksville from 1878 to 1886. He was a justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1886 to 1893.

== U.S. Circuit Court==

Lurton was nominated by President Grover Cleveland on March 22, 1893, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Howell Edmunds Jackson. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 27, 1893, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on December 20, 1909, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court.

Concurrent with his service on the Sixth Circuit, Lurton served as Dean of the law department of Vanderbilt University from 1905 to 1909.

==U.S. Supreme Court==

On December 13, 1909, President William Howard Taft nominated Lurton as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, to succeed Rufus W. Peckham. He was confirmed by the Senate on December 20, 1909, and was sworn into office on January 3, 1910. At 65 years old at the time of his initial appointment in 1909, he was the oldest associate justice ever by initial appointment.

He was Circuit Justice for the Second Circuit from January 10, 1910, until January 8, 1911, Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit from January 9, 1911, until March 17, 1912, and Circuit Justice for the Seventh Circuit from March 18, 1912, until July 12, 1914. His service terminated on July 12, 1914, due to his death in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Lurton sided most frequently on the court with Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a progressive Supreme Court justice. The most notable opinion he authored was probably the opinion of the Court in &quot;Coyle v. Smith&quot;, 221 U.S. 559 (1911), which held that the federal government could not tell a state where to locate its capital, as all states must be on &quot;equal footing.&quot;

==Death==

Lurton&#x27;s tenure on the Court was brief, as he served only four years before dying in Atlantic City, New Jersey of a heart attack on July 12, 1914. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville, Tennessee.

==Legacy and honors==

During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia, and named in his honor.

<text>John Desmond Skirrow (13 November 1923 – 16 August 1976) was a British advertising executive and novelist.

==Writing career==

Skirrow was born in Barry, South Wales. In 1963, Skirrow met Alida Haskins, who showed him the maquette of &quot;Cowboy Kate &amp; Other Stories&quot; by Sam Haskins, and he put words to the visual story devised by Sam and Alida. Alida introduced him to Sam&#x27;s publisher, the Bodley Head in London, who went on to publish his thriller novels. Sam&#x27;s next book, &quot;November Girl&quot;, was published in 1966 and Skirrow provided the text for the melancholic visual story.

While working as an advertising executive in the mid-1960s Skirrow commuted daily from Brighton to London, and he wrote 1,000 words a day until he had a 70,000-word novel. This was &quot;It Won&#x27;t Get You Anywhere&quot;, the first of three spy novels about fictional British agent John Brock. Like his creator, Brock works in advertising in London, but is also a part-time agent for an undercover department run by The Fat Man. Penthouse magazine said that both Brock and Skirrow were likeable, soft-hearted and rather shy. Skirrow denied that he and Brock had any similarity, noting that his hair was blonde and Brock&#x27;s is black. According to Brian Ash, Skirrow &quot;resembled a latter-day Chesterton.&quot; Ruth Martin, writing for &quot;Books &amp; Bookmen&quot;, described Skirrow as &quot;Tall, big, bearded and seemingly incapable of being serious for more than a few minutes at a time.&quot;

Two sequels followed: &quot;I Was Following This Girl&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Trying to Give It Up&quot;, tough, irreverent, and witty. Punch called them &quot;the Chandler formula, basically, but louder and funnier.&quot; &quot;Penthouse&quot; said &quot;between the punch-ups and chases and killings paint a wildly amusing cynical-eye view of the glossy, hysterical world of advertising.&quot;

Skirrow also wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Case of The Silver Egg&quot;, televised as &quot;The Queen Street Gang&quot;, about the adventures of a group of boys tracking down a gang of villains. &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; refers to an unpublished sequel.

Skirrow&#x27;s frequently anthologised poem &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn Summarized&quot; parodies John Keats&#x27; Ode on a Grecian Urn. First published in the New Statesman in 1960, it appeared in the &quot;New Oxford Book of Light Verse&quot; edited by Kingsley Amis. Vanderbilt University coined the term &quot;Skirrowing&quot; for a terse parody of a great poetic work.

BBC Radio 2 Woman&#x27;s Hour serialised &quot;It Won&#x27;t Get You Anywhere&quot; between 2 and 13 November 1970.

==Advertising and art career==

After World War II, Skirrow taught art in the countryside. In 1953 or 1954 he joined WS Crawford where he worked alongside Paul Peter Piech under Ashley Havinden.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Skirrow illustrated book jackets for the British publishers Heinemann and Secker &amp; Warburg, including for Fred Hoyle&#x27;s &quot;The Black Cloud&quot; , Max Shulman&#x27;s &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys!&quot;, James A. Michener&#x27;s &quot;Hawaii&quot; and William L. Shirer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;.

In 1962, David Bernstein, creative director at McCann Erickson, hired Skirrow and Robert Brownjohn as his deputy creative directors at its London office. Bernstein described Skirrow as &quot;a craftsman&quot;.

Skirrow was the Creative Director of major London advertising agency Masius Wynne-Williams, where his colleagues included novelist Christopher Wood and Murray Walker – Walker claims that he and Skirrow disliked each other intensely.

==Death==
He died on 16 August 1976 at The Avenue Clinic in Hove and was cremated at Downs Crematorium, Brighton, on 23 August 1976.

<text>Jaime Ramón Lusinchi (27 May 1924 – 21 May 2014) was the president of Venezuela from 1984 to 1989. His term was characterized by an economic crisis, growth of the external debt, populist policies, currency depreciation, inflation and corruption that exacerbated the crisis of the political system established in 1958.

Although accused of corruption after leaving office, Lusinchi was popular during his presidency, and was succeeded by a member of his Acción Democrática political party, Carlos Andrés Pérez.

==Background==
Jaime Lusinchi was born in Clarines, Anzoategui, on 27 May 1924. His mother María Angelica Lusinchi, who was of Italian-Corsican descent, gave him her family name. Growing up without the presence of a father (who probably was an Italian immigrant), Lusinchi attended elementary school in his native Clarines and Puerto Píritu, and high school at the Federal School of Barcelona, Anzoátegui. In 1941 he began to study medicine at the University of the Andes in Mérida, but soon moved to Caracas continuing his career at the Central University of Venezuela graduating in 1947. He married Gladys Castillo in 1941.

==Political career==
In 1937, at the age of 13, Lusinchi joined the National Democratic Party, organization created by Rómulo Betancourt against the government of Eleazar López Contreras. In 1941, Lusinchi was present at the foundation of the social democratic party Acción Democrática.

During his time at college, Lusinchi stood out as a political activist, was secretary of the School Medicine Council, vice president of the Venezuelan Association of Youth and vice president of the Student Federation of Venezuela - an organization with Marxist influences that became part of the &quot;19 October 1945&quot; revolutionary movement which overthrew the government of Isaías Medina Angarita. In 1948, he was elected president of the Municipal Council of Freites District and president of the Legislative Assembly of Anzoátegui, as well as regional secretary of Acción Democrática.

After the overthrow of Venezuela&#x27;s first democratically elected leader, Rómulo Gallegos, by a military-led coup on 24 November 1948, Lusinchi continued carrying out political activities whilst in hiding from the new military-dominated authorities. For a time he worked in a hospital belonging to the oil company Mene Grande in San Tomé (Anzoátegui state), however he soon moved to Caracas to avoid persecution by security forces who had already arrested him several times before.

In Caracas he was part of the clandestine organization of Acción Democrática which, in coordination with the leadership in exile, established an organised resistance to the military dictatorship. Lusinchi acquired responsibilities in the national secretariats of organization and propaganda, and was a member of the party&#x27;s Political Bureau. In 1950 he was one of the organizers of the nationwide strike of oil workers. After the 1952 election fraud, which dissolved the Civilian-Military Junta and began the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, Lusinchi was again captured and imprisoned at the National Security facility. Lusinchi was jailed for two months and was beaten with a sword.

A month later he was transferred to the &quot;Cárcel Modelo&quot; (Model Prison) in Caracas, and was released shortly after that, beginning an exile of five years in Argentina, Chile and the United States. During his stay in Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, he undertook postgraduate study in Pediatrics. He resided in Santiago from 1953 and worked at Roberto del Río Hospital. In addition, he struck up friendships with prominent figures in local politics, such as the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva and the democratic-socialist leader Salvador Allende.

In 1956 he moved to New York City, which was the focal point of Acción Democrática&#x27;s leadership in exile, with Betancourt as the principal leader. In the aforementioned metropolis Lusinchi obtained a master&#x27;s degree in pediatrics, at Lincoln Hospital and the Bellevue Hospital Center, joining the American Academy of Pediatrics. On 23 January 1958, democracy was restored in Venezuela. Therein after the fall of the Pérez Jiménez Government, Lusinchi returned from exile, and joined the National Executive Committee of Acción Democrática as secretary for International Affairs. In the 1959 General Elections he was elected deputy for Anzoátegui for the National Congress, being re-elected in 1963, 1968 and 1973.

In 1977, Lusinchi unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of Acción Democrática and in the 1978 elections was defeated by Luis Piñerúa Ordaz (who in turn lost against the candidate of COPEI, Luis Herrera Campins). After this, Lusinchi was elected senator for the 1979-1984 period. In March 1981 he was elected General Secretary of Acción Democrática, and on 29 June 1982, he was nominated as a candidate for the 1983 elections.

On 4 December 1983, Lusinchi with 56% of the votes, won the presidency, and Acción Democrática obtained an absolute majority n the Congress. On 2 February 1984, he was sworn in as President of Venezuela for a five-year term.

==Presidency==
Lusinchi started his presidency at the age of 59, promising to govern with fairness, transparency, social sensitivity and austerity in the use of public funds, while presenting himself as a moderate president.

The first three years of his presidency were characterized by efforts to achieve economy stability, the paying off of the foreign debts, the reduction of public spending, the implementation of social programs benefiting the people and the promotion of industrial growth. These goals were not accomplished. However, agriculture and the iron mining industry were developed during his administration, the country achieved positive growth rates at the end of 1984, with a growth rate of 6% in GDP, but the official rate of unemployment inherited from the previous government of Luis Herrera Campins was 20%.

During this period, the government started negotiations to restructure interest payments and amortizations of the foreign debt, which in 1985 was 36 billion dollars (of which 28 billion was from the public sector), contracted with the international private banking and multilateral agencies. The first positive result of this effort was that Venezuela regained a credit-eligibility rating. In addition, Lusinchi took initiatives to increase oil prices via OPEC.

However, Lusinchi was not successful at crucial goals for the development of the country. The oil market was too unstable due to price fluctuations and thus unpredictable, the oil prices were low, and the Venezuelan economy was too oil-dependent. This led to a dismal situation due to an excessively high government fiscal budget, depleting financial reserves for the payment of debt, an important pledge made during Lusinchi&#x27;s presidential campaign.

1985 was characterized by a relative social peace and the absence of labor disputes and strikes, in part due to the support of the government by the largest trade union of the country, the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela, which had traditionally been closely linked to Acción Democrática. During this year, Lusinchi welcomed John Paul II, the first Pope ever to visit Venezuela. But in the second half of his presidency, the social malaise grew, and the government was pressed to change the direction of its policies. In December 1986, the government decided to devalue the official exchange of the national currency bolivar by 93%, culminating with three years of depreciation of the national currency. In 1987, Lusinchi finally stopped the economic program carried out from the beginning of his term in office, and gave up his attempts to pay off the external debt, control the fiscal deficit and restrain public spending.

After that, Lusinchi decreed salary increases, price controls, emission of currency and compensatory bonds for subsidies. These measures tried to appease social tensions, that from 1987 on had appeared with more intensity. Among the consequences of this economic program were, more inflation and budget deficits.

The return to economic populism as in previous administrations safeguarded Lusinchi&#x27;s popularity. However, there occurred currency devaluation, corruption, media criticism and unsatisfactory results from the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE), which was established on 17 December 1984 and whose work encountered the same bureaucratic problems and administrative inefficiency, which it attempted to solve.

During Lusinchi&#x27;s presidency some massacres also occurred, such as the Yumare massacre in Yaracuy on 8 May 1986 that was carried out by the DISIP, Venezuela&#x27;s scientific police, killing nine members of the subversive group &quot;Punto Cero&quot;; and the massacre of El Amparo, in Apure State on 29 October 1988, in which 14 fishermen were mistakenly assumed to be guerrillas and killed by the army.

Lusinchi supported the former minister and political leader Octavio Lepage in his bid to be AD&#x27;s candidate for the 1988 elections, but Lepage was defeated in the internal elections of the party in October 1987 by the former president Carlos Andrés Pérez. Pérez was elected for a new term after a gap as president in 1988. Lusinchi finished his term in office on 2 February 1989.

===John Paul II visits Venezuela===
In January 1986, Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela. This was to be the first time ever that a Roman pontiff had visited that country specifically. As part of that very special event, thousands of people were mobilized to conduct many cultural and religious programs in several different cities, notably Puerto Ordaz, Maracaibo, Mérida and Caracas. To commemorate the place where the Pope conducted Mass while in Caracas, a housing complex was created years later that used the Pope&#x27;s official title, John Paul II, as its own. Unfortunately that effort became tarnished by corruption and scandal.

===Caldas incident===

On 13 August 1987, the Colombian navy corvette &quot;Caldas&quot; sailed into the Gulf of Venezuela, causing a crisis in Colombian-Venezuelan relations that almost led to armed conflict. The crisis was eventually resolved by dialogue between Lusinchi and Colombian President Virgilio Barco.

===Divorce from Gladys Castillo (1988)===
In 1988, President Lusinchi filed for divorce from his wife of 44 years, First Lady Gladys Castillo de Lusinchi, in favor of his longtime mistress and &quot;private secretary&quot;, Blanca Ibáñez. Lusinchi cited &quot;voluntary abandonment of the home&quot; by Castillo. Gladys Castillo rebuked Lusinchi, noting her husband&#x27;s affair and infidelity, saying, &quot;If anyone has committed abandonment and serious insults, it has not been me.&quot; Castillo also refused to move out of the presidential palace. The divorce was granted by a Caracas civil court in April 1988 with unusual speed. Public opinion swiftly turned against the president. The Catholic Church, led by Mérida Archbishop Miguel Antonio Salas, harshly criticized Lusinchi and his decision to initiate divorce proceedings, writing, &quot;&quot;With consternation and astonishment, we have learned from the press of the divorce decree of the presidential couple&quot; and called it &quot;...a bad example by the national magistrate which has dealt a severe blow to the family institution in Venezuela.&quot; The bishops condemned the end of the marriage, which was the first presidential divorce in Venezuelan history, and called the divorce &quot;a mockery of the good faith of Venezuelans&quot;.

== Later career ==

After his presidency had ended, Lusinchi was appointed Senator for Life, as was permitted by the Venezuelan constitution of 1961. But From 27 March 1990, Lusinchi became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry looking at what was believed to be a corruption scandal of huge proportions that took place during his term in government. Accused of illegally influencing decisions at the currency exchange through the financial Regime of Preferential Currency Change (RECADI) and management of funds at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, as well as the purchase of 65 off-road vehicles that were to be used in the 1988 electoral campaign of Acción Democrática; the diversion of other funds from the National Institute for Racetracks (INH). He was also declared a suspect in the August 1993 sending of mail bombs meant to intimidate members of the Supreme Court.

In November 1991, the Venezuelan Congress issued a &quot;political and moral condemnation&quot; to be lodged against the former president for his part in economic mismanagement and administrative irregularities that took place during his term. Then, on 10 August 1993, the Supreme Court decided it had found evidence of actual criminality during its review of charges filed against Lusinchi by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, and started proceedings against him.

On 13 August Lusinchi was stripped of senatorial immunity, and prohibited from leaving of country. Lusinchi responded by flying to Miami. Next he left for Costa Rica where he met Blanca Ibáñez, his future wife. In July 1994, and again in February 1997, charges were filed against him by the courts. A trial was opened against the former president, ostensibly for his illegal use of funds belonging to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the National Institute for Racetracks (INH). But in October 1999, the Supreme Court reversed both decisions.

Although an inquiry into the process of how that happened was later opened, by then the corruption charges against him had expired their legal term of placement. Again in June 2006 however, himself and seven former officials of his government, along with 38 other retired members of the Venezuelan security services DISIP were accused of in some way being guilty of events now known as the Yumare Massacre.

Lusinchi left Venezuela via Miami and lived in the city of San José, Costa Rica. till 2009, when returned to Caracas.

==Personal life and death==
Lusinchi was married to Gladys Castillo in 1941–1988 (they had 2 sons and 3 daughters) who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1984. He then married his private secretary and long-term girlfriend, Blanca Ibáñez, in 1991 and remained married to her until his death in 2014.

Lusinchi died on 21 May 2014 at the age of 89 after having been hospitalized for lung problems. He died about 5 weeks before ex-President Ramón José Velásquez died on 24 June 2014 of natural causes.

<text>John Gijsbert Alan Heitinga (born 15 November 1983) is a Dutch football coach and former player who played as a centre-back. He is currently serving as assistant first-team coach at club Liverpool.

A product of the Ajax Youth Academy, he played for their first squad from 2001 to 2008. After a one-year spell at Atlético Madrid in Spain, he signed for Everton in 2009. Joining Fulham for six months in January 2014, he then signed with German side Hertha BSC the following summer, signing a two-year deal with the Berlin-based club. In June 2015, he returned to his boyhood club Ajax for a single season before retiring in 2016.

After making his debut for the Netherlands national team in February 2004, Heitinga earned over 85 caps and represented his country at two World Cups (2006 and 2010) and three European Championships (2004, 2008, and 2012). In 2008, he was named Dutch Footballer of the Year.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Heitinga was part of the Ajax youth team, before making his debut for the first team on 26 August 2001 against Feyenoord. He was part a new wave of talent that fielded the likes of homegrown stars Rafael van der Vaart and Wesley Sneijder, as well as Zlatan Ibrahimović and Cristian Chivu. He was featured in a documentary entitled &quot;&quot; alongside Ajax academy pupils Gregory van der Wiel, Mitchell Donald, Jeffrey Sarpong, Donovan Slijngard, Nordin Amrabat, Evander Sno and Jeremain Lens.

Heitinga quickly established himself as a strong addition to the team and became first-choice player under coach Co Adriaanse and later Ronald Koeman until he suffered a serious knee injury which kept him on the sidelines for over six months. His comeback was short-lived, as he played only one game before suffering yet another injury which again sentenced him to a long period of recovery.

He made his second comeback at the start of the 2003–04 season and impressed in his first game since injury against Volendam, from where he went on to become a first choice central defender for the remainder of the season as well as a popular figure amongst the fans. When it was announced that he would be leaving Ajax at the end of the 2007–08 season, the fans gave him a fitting send-off by displaying a mosaic of him on the stands.

===Atlético Madrid===
Heitinga moved to Atlético Madrid at the end of the 2007–08 season for a fee of £8.8 million. His first season in Spain ended with Heitinga making 32 appearances – 27 in La Liga – and scoring three goals for Atlético.

===Everton===
In September 2009, aged 25, Heitinga joined English Premier League club Everton on a five-year contract for a fee of around €7.04 million (£6.2 million). He was given squad number 5, though he was not eligible to represent Everton in the UEFA Europa League, having already played for Atlético Madrid in the qualifying stage of the Champions League. Heitinga made his debut for Everton on 13 September against Fulham after coming on for the injured Phil Neville. In his first season for the club, Heitinga made 35 appearances in all competitions. He played mostly as defensive midfielder, covering the absence of several players and showing great spirit and adaptability.

In the 2010–11 FA Cup, Everton held holders Chelsea 1–1 in a replay at Stamford Bridge, sending the tie to penalties. Heitinga took Everton&#x27;s fourth and scored. Phil Neville went on to score the winning penalty for Everton. Later that season, Heitinga scored his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw at home to Birmingham City. Heitinga was voted Everton&#x27;s Player of the Season for 2011–12 by the club&#x27;s supporters. He finally had an extended run of play as centre back, showing the passion and the commanding skills he always put on the field in the orange shirt. He then scored against Newcastle on the final day of the season with an unmarked header which put Everton 3–0, his second Premier League goal and his first in over 14 months.

The 2012–13 season proved to be less successful for Heitinga as manager David Moyes opted to play Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin for much of Everton&#x27;s season. Heitinga had to wait until an injury to Jagielka gave him a sustained run in the team but poor performances which included him being culpable for all three goals in a 3–3 draw with Aston Villa led to him being criticised by fans. However, in April Moyes praised Heitinga&#x27;s mental strength for battling back after his earlier form in the season would have &quot;broken&quot; most players. Despite this, Heitinga revealed that he had rejected Everton&#x27;s offer of a new contract at the end of the year. In January 2014, Everton and West Ham United agreed terms for the transfer of Heitinga. He turned down the move however saying: &quot;You have to be convinced that you are taking the right step and I was not&quot;. He scored his last goal for the team in his last outing, Everton&#x27;s 4–0 FA Cup win against Stevenage before eventually joining Fulham on a free transfer on transfer deadline day.

===Fulham===
On 31 January 2014, Heitinga signed for Fulham for a six-month deal on a free transfer. In a 3–1 loss against Chelsea on 1 March, Heitinga scored the only goal for Fulham. On 23 May 2014, he was released from the club at the end of his contract.

===Hertha BSC===
Heitinga signed a two-year contract with German club Hertha BSC in June 2014.

===Return to Ajax===
On 25 June 2015, Ajax announced that Heitinga would return to the club, joining on a free transfer from German side Hertha BSC. He signed a one-year contract with the option of a second year. However, after playing only two Eredivisie matches in the first half of the season, Heitinga decided to retire from professional football on 1 February 2016.

==Coaching career==
In June 2021, Heitinga was appointed manager of Jong Ajax, the reserve team of Ajax competing in the Eerste Divisie. He signed a contract for two seasons running until June 2023. In 2022, he extended his contract until 2025. On 27 January 2023, Heitinga was appointed interim manager of Ajax&#x27;s first team for the remainder of the season, following the dismissal of Alfred Schreuder. His first match in charge was a 4–1 away win against Excelsior on 29 January. Under Heitinga&#x27;s guidance, Ajax finished in third place in the Eredivisie, securing a place in the UEFA Europa League play-off round. They also reached the final of the KNVB Cup, losing to PSV on penalties after a 1–1 draw. On 1 June 2023, it was announced that Heitinga would not continue as manager of Ajax beyond his interim spell, with the club deciding to appoint Maurice Steijn instead.

In September 2023, Heitinga was appointed first-team coach at West Ham United as assistant to David Moyes, his former manager at Everton. Upon the departure of Moyes in May 2024, Heitinga left the club, along with other coaches and back-room staff. On 17 July 2024, Heitinga was appointed as the new assistant coach at Liverpool.

==International career==

Having been part of Dutch international youth teams, Heitinga made his senior debut for the Netherlands on 18 February 2004 in a friendly game against the United States and made an immediate impact. Several months later, he scored his first goal from a Rafael van der Vaart free kick in a friendly against Greece.

===Euro 2004===
Although he did not take part in qualifying, Heitinga was later included in the squad for the Euro 2004 in Portugal since the Dutch under-21 team had failed to qualify for the European Championships. He started as first choice right back in the first two group stage matches but was suspended for the last match when he was sent-off for two bookable offences. After serving his suspension, he returned in the quarter-final against Sweden as a second-half substitute for Edgar Davids and converted his penalty as the Dutch won 5–4 on penalties. The Dutch, however, were eliminated by the hosts Portugal in the semi-finals.

===2006 World Cup===
Heitinga&#x27;s development as a player suffered two dips in form in the 2004–05 and the 2005–06 seasons, respectively. Despite club struggles, Heitinga never lost his spot in the national team under Marco van Basten, who took over as the Netherlands national coach in the summer of 2004. By the end of 2005, had also again become a key player in the Ajax squad. He would also be selected by Van Basten for the Dutch national team of 23 players to compete in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, hosted by Germany. The Dutch side performed reasonably well at the World Cup, qualifying for the second round before again being knocked out by Portugal.

===Euro 2008===

Heitinga was also called up to the Dutch squad for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Since Euro 2008, he has been a regular in the right back position and has occasionally deputised in other defensive positions during an injury crisis. He made his 50th appearance for the Netherlands in a friendly against Paraguay on 18 November 2009.

===2010 World Cup===

Heitinga was included in the squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and was in the starting line-up for the Netherlands&#x27; first match in the competition, a 2–0 victory over Denmark. Heitinga played in every game as the Netherlands reached the final for the third time, where they faced Spain. He started the match but was sent off in the 109th minute after being given his second yellow card for a foul on Andrés Iniesta.
He became the fifth player to be sent off in a World Cup final. The Netherlands went on to lose the final 1–0 after Iniesta scored the winning goal for Spain in the 116th minute.

==Personal life==
Heitinga was born in Alphen aan den Rijn, South Holland, and raised in Amsterdam. He is of Indonesian descent.

<text>Hugues-Bernard Maret (; 1 May 1763 – 13 May 1839), 1st [[Duke of Bassano]] (&quot;Duc de Bassano&quot;), was a French statesman, diplomat and journalist.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Maret was born in Dijon, in the province of Burgundy, as the second son of a physician and scholar at the Academy of Dijon. Destined for a medical career by his father, he instead decided to study law, and after receiving a solid education Maret entered the legal profession, becoming a lawyer at the King&#x27;s Council in Paris. The ideas of the French Revolution profoundly influenced him, wholly altering his career.
The interest aroused by the debates of the first National Assembly suggested to him the idea of publishing them in the &quot;Bulletin de l&#x27;Assemblée&quot;. The journalist Charles-Joseph Panckoucke (1736–1798), owner of the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; and publisher of the famous &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; (1785), persuaded him to merge this in a larger paper, &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot;, which gained a wide repute for correctness and impartiality.

He was a member of the moderate club, the Feuillants, but, with the overthrow of the monarchy and the insurrection of 10 August 1792 he accepted a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he sometimes exercised a steadying influence. On the withdrawal of the British legation, Citizen Maret (as he was then known) went on a mission to London, where he had a favourable interview with William Pitt the Younger on 22 December 1792 – all hope of an accommodation was, however, in vain. After the execution of Bourbon King Louis XVI (21 January 1793), the chief French diplomatic agent, Bernard-François de Chauvelin, was ordered to leave Britain, while the National Convention declared war (1 February 1793 – &quot;see Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars&quot;). These events limited the impact of Maret&#x27;s second mission to London in January 1794.

===Envoy of the Republic===
After a space in which he held no diplomatic post, he became Ambassador of the French Republic to the Kingdom of Naples; but, while negotiating with Charles de Sémonville he was captured by the Austrian Empire and was kept for some thirty months, until, at the close of 1795, the two were set free in return for the liberation of Princess Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte, the daughter of ex-King Louis XVI.

For a time Maret returned to journalism, but he played a useful part in the negotiations for a peace with Britain which went on at Lille during the summer of 1797, until the victory of the Jacobin Club in Paris in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor (September 1797) frustrated the hopes of Pitt for peace and inflicted on Maret another reverse of fortune.
On Napoleon&#x27;s return from Egypt in 1799, Maret joined the general&#x27;s party which came to power with the 18 Brumaire coup (9 November–10).

===Consulate and Empire===

Maret now became one of Napoleon&#x27;s secretaries and shortly afterwards Secretary of State. An experienced politician, he rendered services of major value to the French Consulate and First French Empire.

The &quot;Moniteur&quot;, which became the official State Journal in 1800, was placed under his control. He sometimes succeeded in toning down the hard, abrupt language of Napoleon&#x27;s communications, and in every way proved a useful intermediary. It is known that he had a share in the drawing up of the new constitutions for the Batavian and Italian Republics.

In 1804, he became Minister; in 1807, he was created Count; and in 1809, he was granted the title of &quot;Duc de Bassano&quot;, one of the titles with the status of &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; in Napoleon&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy. This was a rare hereditary honor (extinct in 1906), which gives an insight into how well respected his work was by the Emperor.
He was extremely devoted to Napoleon, as shown by his work to pass into law the artifices adopted by the latter in April–May 1808 in order to make himself master of the destinies of Spain (&quot;see Peninsular War&quot;). Maret also assisted in drawing up the Spanish Constitution of 1808, which was rejected by almost all Spanish subjects. He accompanied Napoleon through most of his campaigns, including that of 1809 against the Fifth Coalition, and he expressed himself in favour of the marriage alliance with the Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, which took place in 1810.
In the spring of 1811, the Duc de Bassano replaced Jean-Baptiste de Champagny, as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In this capacity he showed his usual ability and devotion, concluding the treaties between France and Austria and between France and Prussia, which preceded the French invasion of Russia in 1812. 
He was with Napoleon through the greater part of that campaign, and after the major defeat, helped to prepare the new forces with which Napoleon waged the equally unsuccessful campaign of 1813 against the Sixth Coalition.

===End of the Empire, exile, and return===

In November 1813 Napoleon replaced Maret with Armand, Marquis of Caulaincourt, who was known to be devoted to the cause of peace and had a personal connection to Tsar Alexander I of Russia. Maret, however, as private secretary of Napoleon, remained with him through the campaign of 1814, as well as during that of 1815 and the Hundred Days.

After the restoration of the Bourbons, Maret was exiled. He retired to Graz, where he occupied himself with literary work. In 1820 he was allowed to return to France. After the July Revolution of 1830, the new king Louis Philippe elevated him as a Peer of France. In November 1834 Maret served a short time as Prime Minister of France.

The Duc de Bassano died at Paris in 1839.

<text>Michael John Reiziger (; born 3 May 1973) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played mainly as a right back. Reiziger currently manages the Netherlands U21 team.

After making a name for himself at Ajax, with whom he won one Champions League, he went on to represent four teams in as many countries, notably Barcelona, for which he played 249 official games in seven years, as well as spells at A.C. Milan, Middlesbrough and PSV Eindhoven.

Reiziger represented the Netherlands national team for a full decade, competing at three European Championships and the 1998 World Cup and finishing fourth in the latter tournament.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in Amstelveen, North Holland to Surinamese parents, Reiziger started his career with hometown club Ajax, making his first-team debut at the age of 17 then serving two consecutive loan spells, with Volendam and Groningen; with the latter, in the 1993–94 season, he scored a career-best six goals while operating also as a midfielder.

Upon his return to Ajax, Reiziger established himself as a renowned defensive element, helping the side to, among other conquests, the 1994–95 edition of the UEFA Champions League. In 1996, he signed for A.C. Milan, but after a season marred by injury, he departed for Barcelona where he spent the following seven years, arriving at the same time as compatriot and former Ajax boss Louis van Gaal; though not an undisputed starter, he nonetheless featured heavily for the Catalans, making more than 200 overall appearances and helping to back-to-back La Liga titles.

In 2004, Reiziger moved to Middlesbrough on a Bosman transfer. He scored once in the league for Boro, against Aston Villa in December 2004. After another campaign plagued by physical problems, he left and returned to the Netherlands to see out his career at PSV Eindhoven (in his second year he won the Eredivisie, and was also reunited with Ajax, Barça and national teammate Patrick Kluivert, although the two rarely ever played).

===International===

Reiziger made his debut for the Netherlands national team on 12 October 1994, against Norway. He played for his country at the UEFA Euro 1996, 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000 and Euro 2004, retiring from international play after the latter.

Shortly after signing for PSV, Reiziger said he would consider playing for the Netherlands again if the opportunity arose, but he was never recalled again, totalling 72 appearances in ten years.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Reiziger settled in Barcelona. He later went on to coach Sparta Rotterdam at youth level and, subsequently and successively, acted as assistant to Gert Kruys and Alex Pastoor.

On 20 June 2017, Reiziger returned to Ajax as manager of the reserves who competed in the Eerste Divisie, replacing Marcel Keizer. In his first season in charge he led the squad to the league title, but they were ineligible for promotion. He also acted as interim for the first team during one match after the dismissal of Keizer, defeating Willem II 3–1 at home.

After Reiziger&#x27;s contract expired, he was replaced by Mitchell van der Gaag at the helm of Ajax B. He was then offered a position as assistant coach of the first team, which he accepted.

==Personal life==
Reiziger&#x27;s son, Gabriël (born 2005), also came through the Ajax youth system.

<text>Yury Mikhailovich Luzhkov (; 1936 – 10 December 2019) was a Russian politician who served as mayor of Moscow from 1992 to 2010. Before the election of Gavriil Popov as the first mayor of Moscow, he also headed the capital in 1990-1991 as chairman of the Mosgorispolkom. He was the vice-chairman and one of the founders of the ruling United Russia party. During Luzhkov&#x27;s time, Moscow&#x27;s economy expanded and he presided over large construction projects in the city, including the building of a new financial district. At the same time, he was accused of corruption, bulldozing historic buildings, and poor handling of traffic, as well as the city&#x27;s smog crisis during the 2010 Russian wildfires. On 28 September 2010, Luzhkov was fired from his post by a decree issued by then-President Dmitry Medvedev.

==Early life==
Yury Mikhailovich Luzhkov was born on 21 September 1936 in Moscow. His father, Mikhail Andreyevich Luzhkov, moved to Moscow from a small village in Tver Oblast in the 1930s.

==Mayoral career==
In April 1990, the new chairman of the Moscow City Council, Gavriil Popov, on the recommendation of Boris Yeltsin, nominated Luzhkov for the post of chairman of the Mosgorispolkom.

Following the August coup Luzhkov was appointed on 24 August 1991, without leaving the post of vice-mayor of Moscow, one of three deputy heads of the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet economy, which was created to replace the Cabinet of Ministers, which had supported the coup, and became the last government of the Soviet Union. He was responsible for questions related to the agro-industrial complex, trade, foreign economic relations and the social sphere. Two months later it became known that Luzhkov left the committee due to employment as vice mayor.

=== Architecture ===
Many old Soviet landmarks, such as Rossiya Hotel or Voentorg, were reconstructed or demolished, as well as several old buildings around the Kadashi Church in the proximity of the Moscow Kremlin. Many neighbourhoods, like Zamoskvorechye, were dramatically changed. Sculptor Zurab Tsereteli enjoyed Luzhkov&#x27;s personal support in setting many of his works over the city.

In 1999, in order to improve the housing conditions of Moscovites, Yury Luzhkov initiated a major demolition programme to replace Moscow’s old five-story apartment blocks that were unsuitable for renovation because of the outdated technology used during their construction. 1,722 of them were to be razed by 2010. The authorities stipulated that the apartment blocks could only be torn down and replaced after its residents had been moved into new housing.

===Registration===
Luzhkov&#x27;s rationale for permanent living place (propiska) registration was that Moscow&#x27;s city infrastructure could not handle a rapidly growing population. Some of the most blatant limitations were removed by the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court after a long fight with Luzhkov&#x27;s lawyers, making the registration process somewhat simpler. In 2003 Privacy International awarded Luzhkov the runner-up position in its Most Egregiously Stupid Award for the propiska rules.

===Popularity===
In April 2001, 63% of Moscow residents had a good or very good view of Mayor Luzhkov. However, Luzhkov&#x27;s ratings steadily declined, and according to the latest poll from October 2009, only 36% of Muscovites viewed him positively.

===Allegations of corruption===
Allegations of wrongdoing by Luzhkov had been made before, but he had been notable for never having lost a libel suit in his career, including against Boris Nemtsov, the newspaper Kommersant, and The New York Times.

Despite the lawsuit history between the two, after Luzhkov’s dismissal Boris Nemtsov said: ‘I can’t help feeling that the current investigation is more of a revenge against Luzhkov and Baturina, and not an attempt to restore a lawful situation. I am absolutely convinced that the main task here is raiding with the help of the State. The goal is to take Baturina&#x27;s business from her for a pittance. And criminal cases are just the way to do it. It&#x27;s disgusting to take part in marauding, and I will never do it. Thus, the story of my conflict with Baturina is from now on completely over.&quot;

===Dismissal===
Luzhkov was dismissed by President Medvedev on 28 September 2010, after returning from a holiday in Austria, citing &quot;loss of trust&quot;. Pundits had been predicting Luzhkov&#x27;s imminent ousting for years. The September 2010 dismissal followed weeks of speculation regarding Luzhkov&#x27;s position, caused by his questioning of Medvedev&#x27;s leadership. Government-controlled television channels had run programs criticizing Luzhkov&#x27;s handling of the 2010 summer peat fires and accused him and his wife of corruption. Some observers have seen this as being part of a struggle between Medvedev and then-Prime Minister Putin. Luzhkov officially declared that he had left the United Russia party. Luzhkov had sent a letter to the President on 27 September criticizing Medvedev&#x27;s policy and his administration&#x27;s actions. According to the President&#x27;s press-secretary Medvedev read the letter after the decision had been made but it would not have affected that decision in any case.

==Post-mayoral activities==
On 1 October 2010 Luzhkov was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Management of major cities of the International University in Moscow. The order for appointment was signed by the president of the university, former mayor (and Luzhkov&#x27;s predecessor as mayor) of Moscow Gavriil Popov. The faculty of management of large cities was established in 2002 on the initiative of Luzhkov, in the same year Luzhkov became the scientific leader of this faculty and an honorary professor at the university. On the same day, ex-mayor Luzhkov left his former workplace.

On 21 September 2016, Luzhkov&#x27;s 80th birthday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree awarding him the Order of Merit of the Fatherland, 4th degree &quot;for active public work&quot;.

In 2010, Luzhkov became head of Veedern, the agricultural enterprise with the territory of 5,500 hectare in the North-West of Russia. He established and managed a large farmstead that was active in horse and sheep breeding, grain growing and cereal production, cheese making, etc. In 2017, the farm produced a total of 10,000 tons of grain (barley, wheat, buckwheat), and its buckwheat harvest covered 2/3 of the regional need.

The farm employed more than 100 locals, offered highly competitive wages and social support. Luzhkov claimed that his main goal as a farmer was the creation of a self-sustainable and business efficient enterprise, developing and promoting to the regional and federal authorities a system of support for private agricultural enterprises. After his death, the farm was inherited by Luzhkov’s younger son Alexander.

==In Russia&#x27;s politics==
In 1998, as Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s political troubles grew partly because of the August economic crisis, Luzhkov formed his own national political faction, Otechestvo (Fatherland), to serve as his base for the upcoming presidential election. Otechestvo had the support of many powerful regional politicians, and it gained further support when it merged with another party, Vsya Rossiya (All Russia) to form Otechestvo-Vsya Rossiya. Many observers of Russian politics believed that Luzhkov and his new ally, former prime minister Yevgeniy Primakov, would be likely to displace both Yeltsin and his inner circle in the parliamentary and presidential elections due to be held in late 1999 and mid-2000, respectively.

However, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister in August 1999. While virtually unknown when first appointed, Putin rapidly gained popular support due to a hard-line law and order image and the backing of powerful state-owned and state-allied media and economic interests. Supporters of the prime minister, Luzhkov and his party integrated with the pro-Putin Unity party into the single United Russia following the autumn 1999 Duma campaign, and endorsed Putin in the 2000 presidential elections, which he won easily. Luzhkov remained a co-chairman of United Russia.

==Criticism==
Luzhkov was accused of brutal suppression of opposition protests, and he was widely condemned for leaving Moscow during the smog crisis resulting from the 2010 Russian wildfires. He is also blamed for traffic congestion in the city.

==Controversy==
In 2002, Luzhkov proposed returning to Lubyanka Square the fifteen-ton iron statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet Cheka. The statue was removed after the failure of the attempted coup against the Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. Opponents of the proposal collected the signatures of 114,000 Moscow residents against the statue&#x27;s return.

===Stance on Sevastopol===
In 1996 Luzhkov, hoping to advance his political stature on a national level, became the main advocate for a claim to the city of Sevastopol in Ukraine. In December, the Russian Federation Council passed a resolution officially claiming the city, affecting negotiations between President Boris Yeltsin and Ukraine&#x27;s President Leonid Kuchma over possession of the Black Sea Fleet (housed at Sevastopol) and helping spur Ukraine to seek a relationship with NATO.

On 12 May 2008 Luzhkov was banned from entering Ukraine by the Security Service (SBU) after his statement concerning the legal status of Sevastopol:

===Destruction of the Rechnik neighbourhood===
It was Luzhkov who controversially ordered the destruction of houses built in the Rechnik neighbourhood of Moscow. According to an interview published in the &quot;Moskovsky Komsomolets&quot;, Luzkhov said that the residents were squatting on land in a &quot;protected environmental zone.&quot; Residents claimed that Soviet-era permits to the land, which was set aside as a gardening collective in the 1950s, gave them de facto title over the land the houses were built on and many of these titles were bought or inherited from the original owners; Luzhkov was accused of lobbying the interests of building companies. However, the City Hall claimed that no permissions for private house building on that land were given since the 1950s and that the residents could never claim amnesty because of that. Nevertheless, Luzhkov stated that the city was ready to provide full compensation by offering other land plots in the vicinity of Moscow for veterans of World War II who lived in Rechnik since Soviet times.

===Honouring Stalin===
In 2010, Luzhkov made public his plans to honour Soviet leader Joseph Stalin with ten posters of him in the city of Moscow, for the first time in around fifty years after Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s criticism of Stalin-period policies. Liberal critics expressed concern that Stalin was being rehabilitated as memories of his &quot;reign of terror&quot; faded.

==Personal life==
Luzhkov married his first wife, Marina Bashilova, in 1958, and had two sons with her, Mikhail and Alexander. Bashilova died from liver cancer in 1989. He met his second wife, businesswoman Yelena Baturina, 27 years his junior, in 1987. They married in 1991 and had two daughters, Elena (born 1992) and Olga (born 1994), and owned a home in the affluent Kensington area of London, purchased in 2013 through an offshore company domiciled in Gibraltar.

Luzhkov frequently appeared in public at different festivals and celebrations, and was an enthusiastic promoter of Moscow. His hobbies included tennis and beekeeping. His support for physical fitness was well known, and a statue of the mayor in tennis garb was created by Zurab Tsereteli.

===Personal views===
Luzhkov was allegedly a devoted Orthodox Christian believer, often appearing at Christmas and Easter liturgies. A BBC documentary made during the late 1990s questioned this, asserting he was not an Orthodox Christian. When asked why he supported the Church, he replied that he supported its moral teachings. He was friendly with Patriarch Alexy II. In 2005 he was given an award from the International Fund of Unity of Orthodox Christians.

Luzhkov was critical of homosexuality and issued several bans on the Moscow Pride parade, organised by Nikolay Alexeyev. Gay activists accused him of homophobia, and sent their appeals to the European Court of Human Rights complaining the breach of Freedom of Assembly, which is granted in the European Convention on Human Rights.

Luzhkov was known as an enthusiastic advocate of the Northern river reversal project, which he believed would solve the water problem of Central Asia and earn money for Russia.

===Death===
Luzkhov died on 10 December 2019 in Munich, Germany at the Klinikum der Universität München where he underwent invasive heart surgery. Luzhkov was administered anesthesia and died from subsequent anaphylactic shock.

<doc id="756427" wikidata="Q710026" url="?curid=756427" title="Luigi Luzzatti">
<text>Luigi Luzzatti (11 March 1841 – 29 March 1927) was an Italian financier, political economist, social philosopher, and jurist. He served as the 20th prime minister of Italy between 1910 and 1911.

Luzzatti came from a wealthy and cultured Jewish family and built a reputation as a social reformer dedicated to raise the working classes from ignorance and poverty. He is remembered being the founder of the Italian credit union movement and for his book &quot;Dio nella libertà&quot; (God in Freedom), in which he advocates religious tolerance. This provoked an exchange of correspondence between him and Benedetto Croce.

==Early life==

Luzzatti was born to Jewish parents in Venice on 11 March 1841. After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome.

Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people&#x27;s banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. In 1865 he founded the &quot;Banca Popolare di Milano&quot; in Milan, the second cooperative bank in Italy (the first one was the Banca Popolare di Lodi). The popular banks, modelled after the credit unions Schulze-Delitzsch had introduced in the 1850s, aimed to provide credits to peasants, small shopkeepers and artisans whose only option for capital had been pawnbrokers or usurious moneylenders.

In 1869 he was appointed by Minghetti under secretary of state to the ministry of agriculture and commerce, in which capacity he abolished government control over commercial companies and promoted a state inquiry into the conditions of industry. Though theoretically a free trader, he was largely instrumental in creating the Italian protective system. In 1877 he participated in the commercial negotiations with France, in 1878 compiled the Italian customs tariff, and subsequently took a leading part in the negotiations of all the commercial treaties between Italy and other countries.

==Banca Romana scandal==
Appointed minister of the treasury in the first Di Rudinì cabinet of 1891, he imprudently abolished the system of frequent clearings of banknotes between the state banks, a measure which facilitated the duplication of part of the paper currency and hastened the bank crisis of 1893 and the resulting Banca Romana scandal. A Parliamentary Commission that investigated the bank scandal concluded that former prime minister Francesco Crispi, Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, and Luzzatti, had been aware of the conditions of the Banca Romana but had held back that information.

In 1896 he entered the second Di Rudinì cabinet as minister of the treasury, and by timely legislation helped to save the bank of Naples from failure. Following the revolt and suppression of the Fasci Siciliani (1891–1894), Luzzatti introduced two measures of social legislation in 1898. The industrial workmen&#x27;s compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created.

After his fall from office in June 1898, his principal achievement was the negotiation of the Franco-Italian commercial treaty, though, as deputy, journalist and professor, he continued to take an active part in all political and economic manifestations. He was again minister of the treasury from November 1903 to March 1905 in Giolitti&#x27;s second administration, and for the third time from February to May 1906, under Sonnino&#x27;s premiership. During the latter term of office he achieved the conversion of the Italian 5% debt (reduced to 4% by the tax) to 3¾% to be eventually lowered to 3½%, an operation which other ministers had attempted without success; although the actual conversion was not completed until after the fall of the cabinet of which he formed part the merit is entirely his. In 1907 he was president of the co-operative congress at Cremona.

==Prime minister==
He was minister of agriculture in the second Sonnino Cabinet (December 2, 1909 - March 21, 1910), and on the resignation of the latter was called upon to form a cabinet himself. His administration, which lasted until March 18, 1911, was not very successful and fell over a proposed electoral reform. Although a man of first-class financial ability, great honesty and wide culture, he had not the strength of character necessary to lead a government: he showed lack of energy in dealing with opposition and tried to avoid all measures likely to make him unpopular. Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, as it was then constituted, he only held office at Giolitti&#x27;s good pleasure.

During the First World War, he was consistently pro-Ally and strongly supported Italian intervention, but his tone was on the whole pessimistic. Although he did not take office while the war lasted, he was always consulted on all financial matters, and his sound advice was generally followed.

He became treasury minister in the second incarnation of the Nitti cabinet (March 12 - May 10, 1920), but did not resume office in the third. At the general elections of May 1921, he decided not to stand for parliament again, and was made a senator. In spite of his advanced age, he continued to write on economic and financial problems with his accustomed lucidity and soundness of judgment, insisting on the necessity for Italy to return to free trade and to reduce government interference in business matters to a minimum.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Rome on March 29, 1927, at the age of 86. He pioneered social legislation in Italy and initiated important social reforms, such as compulsory accident insurance. He also promoted workers&#x27; cooperatives, credit unions and voluntary insurance schemes that allowed people to take charge of their future. Luzzatti, nevertheless, remained a typical liberal of his time: he believed that government action to help the poor should be carefully restricted, and that the government should only intervene when private initiative proved inadequate; welfare schemes should not exonerate workers from investing effort in their own moral and economic regeneration.

After becoming Treasury Minister in 1896, he is credited to have saved Italy from bankruptcy. He supported the Zionist movement, specifically agricultural settlements in Palestine.

<text>Saint George is one of the parishes of Grenada, located on the south-western end of the island. The capital of Grenada, St. George&#x27;s, is located in this parish, and it is regarded as the most picturesque capital in the Caribbean. Its horseshoe-shaped harbour is surrounded by the pastel colors of warehouses and it is not uncommon to see red-tiled roofs on traditional shops and homes. Saint George is also the home of the world-famous Grand Anse Beach and many of the island&#x27;s holiday resorts.

The peninsula at the south-western tip of Saint George is called Point Salines, and the only active airport on the island of Grenada, Maurice Bishop International Airport, is located there. The tourist infrastructure is more extensive in Saint George than in the rest of the island, due to the airport, capital city and most popular beaches all being found in this parish. It is also home to St. George&#x27;s University.

As of 2001, Saint George has a population of 35,559, making it the most populous parish of Grenada. It is also the second largest, with an area of .

<doc id="756433" wikidata="Q43913" url="?curid=756433" title="Arjen Robben">
<text>Arjen Robben (; born 23 January 1984) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a winger. Known for his dribbling skills, speed, ball control and long-range shots, he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest wingers in the history of the sport.

Robben first came to prominence with Groningen, for whom he was player of the year for the 2000–01 Eredivisie season. Two years later he signed for PSV, where he became the Netherlands&#x27; Young Player of the Year and won an Eredivisie title. The following season Robben&#x27;s signature was pursued by leading clubs, and after protracted transfer negotiations, he joined Chelsea in 2004. Robben&#x27;s Chelsea debut was delayed through injury, but upon returning to fitness, he helped Chelsea bring home two consecutive Premier League titles, and was the Premier League Player of the Month in November 2004. After a third season in England which was punctuated by injury, Robben signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €35 million.

In August 2009, Robben transferred to Bayern Munich for a fee of around €25 million. In his first season in Munich, Bayern won the league title, Robben&#x27;s fifth league title in eight years. Robben scored the winning goal in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final, being named to the Squad of the Season. In 2014, he was named to the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year, and fourth place in the Ballon d&#x27;Or. In Germany, he won 20 trophies, including eight Bundesliga titles and five DFB Pokals. During his long tenure at Bayern, Robben was also known for his fruitful partnership with fellow winger Franck Ribéry – together they were affectionately referred to by the nickname &quot;Robbery&quot;.

Robben started in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final, which the Netherlands lost to Spain. He also appeared at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships, and the 2006 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. In the latter, he won the Bronze Ball and was named to the All-Star Team.

== Early life ==
Robben was born in Bedum, in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben&#x27;s skill in ball control and technical footwork made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto his left foot to score some quite spectacular goals.

== Club career ==
=== Groningen ===
Groningen placed Robben in their first team for the 1999–2000 season. He scored three goals in league play. Manager Jan van Dijk added the winger to the first team before Groningen&#x27;s November 2000 away game against Twente, but he did not play until 3 December 2000 against RKC Waalwijk as a substitute for the injured Leonardo dos Santos in the 79th minute. During the winter, Robben managed to play himself into the starting lineup. In 18 starts for Groningen over the 2000–01 season, he scored two goals. Robben was named player of the year for his first season with the club, and with teammate Jordi Hoogstrate, he demonstrated the strength of the Groningen youth academy. Robben stayed with Groningen and improved steadily during the 2001–02 season, playing in 28 matches and scoring six goals. Robben transferred to PSV for €3.9 million before the 2002–03 season.

=== PSV ===
During his first season for PSV, the 2002–03 season, Robben played 33 matches and scored 12 goals. He was named &quot;PSV co-player of the year&quot; along with striker Mateja Kežman, with whom he formed an attacking partnership still fondly referred to by PSV fans as &quot;Batman and Robben&quot;. He helped lead PSV to their 17th Dutch title, and won the Talented Player of the Year award. After this good start, PSV could not keep up with rival Ajax and were forced into a fight for second place in the Eredivisie. Robben travelled to London and met with Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferguson&#x27;s offer came in much too low for PSV&#x27;s and Robben&#x27;s liking; PSV chairman Harry van Raaij told Manchester United the most that their €7 million offer would buy them was a shirt with Robben&#x27;s autograph. Almost immediately, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich offered €18 million (£12.1 million), and PSV accepted. The rest of his season with PSV was disappointing: he injured his hamstring twice and missed several games. By the end of the season, Robben scored five times in 23 Eredivisie matches.

=== Chelsea ===

==== 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons ====

Robben did not make his competitive debut for Chelsea until 23 October 2004 against Blackburn Rovers, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth on one of his testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.

Robben proved to be a crucial player for the 2004–05 season; in November 2004, he was awarded the Premier League Player of the Month award. Robben ended the 2004–05 season with seven goals, his second highest professional total. He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year, but was beaten by Manchester United&#x27;s Wayne Rooney. Robben was badly injured in a Premier League match away to Blackburn Rovers and forced to sit out the 2005 Football League Cup Final, Chelsea&#x27;s title run-in and progress to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Back to fitness for 2005–06, Robben was an integral part of the Chelsea left wing. In 28 matches, Robben contributed six goals as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League championship, the first back-to-back titles for the west London club.

==== 2006–07 season ====
Robben was later named man of the match on 23 December 2006 against Wigan Athletic, a match where he got two assists and the winning goal.

Robben was inflicted with yet another injury in a match against Liverpool on 20 January 2007. Robben made his return in a 3–0 victory against Middlesbrough in February, driving in a shot that took a deflection past Mark Schwarzer for an own goal by Abel Xavier. He came on as a substitute for Claude Makélélé in the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal and set up the winning goal for Didier Drogba. Robben scored a goal in the second round of the Champions League against Porto, which led to Chelsea winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate. At the end of March 2007, Robben underwent a knee operation after sustaining a knee injury upon returning from international duty that was expected to rule him out for at least four weeks. He only made two further appearances for Chelsea, both of which were as a substitute and both of which would prove to be key games for the club. His first appearance since returning from injury was against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg which went to penalties. Robben went on to have his penalty saved by Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost.

Robben&#x27;s final appearance for the club came against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final. Robben replaced Joe Cole at half-time, but was then substituted himself for Ashley Cole in extra time as Chelsea emerged victorious. Spanish club Real Madrid were interested in two of Chelsea&#x27;s players. Then manager Bernd Schuster is said to have demanded Michael Ballack, while Real Madrid&#x27;s then president Ramón Calderón was known to favour Robben. Robben said to reporters of Spanish newspaper &quot;AS&quot;, &quot;I do not know when a deal will be reached. I would like to send a message to the Madrid fans, but I can&#x27;t until my future is sorted.&quot;

Real Madrid eventually secured Robben&#x27;s services in August 2007. He told Chelsea&#x27;s official club website:

=== Real Madrid ===

Robben completed his move to Real Madrid on a five-year deal on 22 August 2007, with the transfer fee reported as £24 million (€35 million). He made his debut on 18 September as a substitute for Raúl during a Champions League match against Werder Bremen, which Real Madrid won 2–1. His La Liga debut came on 23 September, as a substitute for Royston Drenthe in a 1–1 away draw against Real Valladolid. On 10 February 2008, Robben scored his first goal, coming at home in a 7–0 victory against Valladolid. Robben proved crucial for many Real Madrid matches, making his famous runs down the left wing and quickly became a first choice for the left midfield position, making 28 appearances during his debut season and scoring five goals. Real Madrid won the Liga title with multiple games to spare, and were already the champions of Spain when they played their arch-rivals Barcelona on 7 May 2008. The Barcelona players formed a guard of honour as the Madrid team came onto the pitch at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Robben played an important part in Real Madrid&#x27;s subsequent 4–1 victory, scoring the champions&#x27; second goal.

Robben retained his key role in the Real Madrid midfield during the 2008–09 season, playing 35 times and scoring 8 goals. Although the Dutchman was one of the Spanish side&#x27;s most important players in the pre-season games leading up to the 2009–10 season, having scored three goals and help set up another four, he was among the players whose place in the first team became threatened following the arrival of Florentino Pérez and the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká. Real Madrid accepted a bid of around €25 million for Robben from Bayern Munich. Robben claimed he was &quot;forced&quot; to leave Real Madrid, saying that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to go, but the club wanted to sell him&quot;.

=== Bayern Munich ===
==== 2009–10 season ====

On 28 August 2009, Robben moved to Bayern Munich for around €25 million. He was given the number 10 jersey, last worn by his fellow Dutchman, Roy Makaay. On 9 March 2010, Robben scored the deciding goal in Bayern&#x27;s 2–3 defeat (4–4 on aggregate over two legs) against Fiorentina, taking them through to the quarter-finals of the 2009–10 Champions League on away goals.

On 7 April 2010, Robben sent Bayern into the semi-finals of the Champions League with a stunning volley against Manchester United from the edge of the area into the corner of the net. The game ended 3–2 to United (4–4 on aggregate), with Bayern advancing again due to away goals.

On 17 April 2010, he scored his first hat-trick in the Bundesliga against Hannover 96 in the Allianz Arena. The game ended 7–0 to the Bavarians. On 8 May 2010, he won his first Bundesliga title with Bayern after scoring two goals in their 3–1 victory over Hertha BSC, finishing as Bayern&#x27;s top scorer in the process.

A week later, Bayern played in the DFB-Pokal final against the previous champions of the tournament, Werder Bremen, in Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion. Bayern won the game 4–0, with Robben scoring the first of his team&#x27;s goals from a penalty kick. Robben thus helped the Bavarians achieve their 15th DFB-Pokal title. On 25 May 2010, Robben was named Footballer of the Year in Germany for 2010. He was the fourth foreigner and the first Dutchman to win the title. He finished the 2009–10 season with 23 goals in 37 appearances.

==== 2010–11 season ====

The 2010–11 season started poorly for Robben, after medical tests confirmed that his hamstring had not properly healed and would be out for two months. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge stated that &quot;Of course, Bayern Munich are very angry&quot; with the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), and would be seeking compensation from them, continuing, &quot;Once again we must pay the bill as a club after a player is seriously injured playing for a national team.&quot; On 15 January 2011, he returned to first-team action, coming on as a substitute in the 1–1 away draw with VfL Wolfsburg.

Robben was nominated for the UEFA Champions League Best Midfielder award, but the award went to his international compatriot Wesley Sneijder. He has also been nominated for the prestigious Ballon d&#x27;Or award and the FIFA Puskás Award, which goes to the best goal of the year, and he has also been nominated for FIFA&#x27;s FIFPro World XI 2010 squad thanks to his season with Bayern Munich. He finished the 2010–11 season with 13 goals in 17 appearances.

==== 2011–12 season ====
In the second leg of the semi-finals of the 2011–12 Champions League, against his former club Real Madrid, which was then managed by José Mourinho (who had been his manager at Chelsea), after Bayern fell behind 2–0, Robben converted a penalty to level the tie at 3–3. Bayern advanced to the final after winning the resulting penalty shootout.

On 3 May 2012, it was reported that Robben had signed a new contract with Bayern which would last until 2015.

Robben had an extra-time penalty saved by former teammate Petr Čech in the 2012 Champions League final at the Allianz Arena against Chelsea. Had he scored, Bayern Munich would have led Chelsea 2–1. The match, however, ended in a penalty shootout which Chelsea won. That was the fourth major cup final that he had been on the losing side during the last two years (FIFA World Cup final, two Champions League finals and the DFB-Pokal). Three days later in the same stadium, and while playing as a second-half substitute for the Netherlands in a friendly against Bayern Munich, he was jeered by some disgruntled Bayern fans every time he touched the ball (due to his penalty miss in the Champions League final, and as he did not play on Bayern&#x27;s side during that match due to a decision taken by Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk). The match had been organised to compensate Bayern, since Robben aggravated an injury playing for the Netherlands at the 2010 World Cup, and went on to miss several months of the 2010–11 season. He finished the 2011–12 season with 19 goals in 36 appearances.

==== 2012–13 season ====
In the 2012–13 season, Robben played in the German Super Cup. He had started the season on the bench, as manager Jupp Heynckes preferred to start Thomas Müller on the right wing, with Toni Kroos at the attacking midfielder position. Robben had played through the season as a substitute but earned his chance to start again after Kroos was injured during the Champions League tie against Juventus. He started on the right wing for the rest of the season, having moved Müller back to the middle. Robben started against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal and scored the game&#x27;s lone goal in the 43rd minute. In the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, Robben started both games and scored in both, including the go-ahead goal in the second leg. Bayern would then go on to return to the final in Wembley Stadium. Robben atoned for his penalty missed the previous season by setting up teammate Mario Mandžukić&#x27;s goal to open the scoring in the 60th minute then netting an 89th-minute winner in a 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to give Bayern their fifth Champions League/European Cup title. During the presentation, he was named Man of the Match by UEFA. Hence, he has been called &quot;Mr Wembley&quot; since then. He finished the 2012–13 season with 13 goals in 31 appearances.

==== 2013–14 season ====
Robben scored his first goals of the 2013–14 season in the 2013 DFL-Supercup, a 4–2 defeat to Borussia Dortmund. On 9 August 2013, his opening goal helped Bayern to a 3–1 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach in their first match of the 2013–14 Bundesliga campaign. On 17 September, he scored in Bayern&#x27;s Champions League opener against CSKA Moscow at the Allianz Arena. He went on to score two further goals during the Champions League group stage; in away wins against Manchester City and CSKA as Bayern finished as group winners. On 23 November, Robben was one of three scorers as Bayern beat title rivals Borussia Dortmund 3–0 at the Westfalenstadion. On 4 December, Robben was substituted with a deep cut on his right knee in a 2–0 DFB-Pokal win away to FC Augsburg which prevented him from taking part in the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup.

On 1 March 2014, Robben scored a hat-trick in Bayern&#x27;s 5–1 win over Schalke 04. On 19 March, he signed a contract extension with Bayern which will keep him at the club until 2017. On 9 April, Robben scored Bayern&#x27;s third goal in a 3–1 Champions League quarter-final against Manchester United, to secure qualification to the semi-finals. On 17 May, Robben scored Bayern&#x27;s opening goal in a 2–0 extra-time defeat of Borussia Dortmund in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final, giving him his third league and cup double in five seasons with the club. His goal also made him the first player to score in three separate DFB-Pokal finals. On 13 July, after winning the third-place match at the 2014 World Cup, Louis van Gaal invited Robben to follow him to Manchester United, but the latter ruled out the move. He finished the 2013–14 season with 21 goals in 45 appearances.

==== 2014–15 season ====
In Bayern&#x27;s opening match of the 2014–15 Bundesliga season, Robben scored one goal and assisted the other as the team defeated VfL Wolfsburg 2–1 on 22 August 2014. On 1 November, he scored the winning goal from a penalty kick against Borussia Dortmund in &quot;Der Klassiker&quot;. On 16 December 2014, Robben scored his 100th competitive goal for Bayern Munich in a home match against SC Freiburg.

On 21 February 2015, Robben scored twice in a 6–0 win against SC Paderborn, giving him the record of scoring against every Bundesliga team he had faced. He ended 2014–15 alongside teammate Robert Lewandowski as joint second-top goalscorer in the Bundesliga with 17 goals. This was despite the player missing the last two months of the season through injury. He finished the 2014–15 season with 19 goals in 30 appearances.

==== 2015–16 season ====
Robben started his 2015–16 season by scoring the opening goal of the DFL-Supercup against VfL Wolfsburg. The match finished in a 1–1 draw, and Robben scored in the subsequent shootout, however Bayern were defeated.

Robben&#x27;s first goal of the Bundesliga season came from a penalty kick in a 3–0 defeat of Bayer Leverkusen on 29 August. However, an injury suffered six days later when playing for the Netherlands against Iceland in qualification for UEFA Euro 2016 kept him out of Bayern&#x27;s next nine fixtures. On 24 October, Robben returned to the Bayern team, playing 65 minutes and scoring the opening goal of a 4–0 win against 1. FC Köln, the club&#x27;s 1,000th Bundesliga victory. He made his first Champions League appearance of the season on 4 November, scoring after coming on as a substitute in Bayern&#x27;s 5–1 win over Arsenal. He finished the 2015–16 season with seven goals in 22 appearances.

==== 2016–17 season ====
Robben, recovering from his injury, was chosen for a friendly against SV Lippstadt 08. He scored a goal, shortly before being substituted because of another injury in the 36th minute. Robben&#x27;s six-week injury caused him to miss several matches. He returned to training and remained on the bench until 21 September Bundesliga match against Hertha BSC, where he came on instead of Thomas Müller and scored in the 3–0 victory. Robben scored in both first and second leg of the round-of-sixteen tie against Arsenal as Bayern won 10–2 on aggregate. He finished the 2016–17 season with 16 goals in 37 appearances.

==== 2017–18 season ====

On 16 January 2017, Robben signed a one-year extension with Bayern, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2017–18 season. He scored a goal with his right foot for the first time since February 2015 in a 4–0 victory over 1. FSV Mainz 05 on 16 September. On 18 October, Robben made his 100th Champions League appearance in a 3–0 victory over Celtic F.C. in the group stage match of the competition. On 4 November, Robben scored a stunning goal in a 3–1 away win over their Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker which made him Bayern&#x27;s most successful non-German scorer in the Bundesliga and the most successful Dutch goal scorer in the Bundesliga. He managed to score twice in a 6–0 away victory over SC Paderborn as Bayern went on through to the semi-final of DFB-Pokal on 6 February 2018. On 25 April, he had an injury within the first ten minutes of the Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid, which forced him to miss the rest of the season.

Robben won his seventh Bundesliga title and set a Dutch record by winning his 11th career domestic league title surpassing Dutch legend Johan Cruyff&#x27;s 10 career domestic league titles. He finished the 2017–18 season with seven goals in 34 appearances.

On 11 May 2018, Robben signed a one-year contract; extending his stay until the end of the 2018–19 season.

==== 2018–19 season ====
On 12 August, he started the season by playing in the 2018 DFL-Supercup for 58 minutes and won the title as Bayern defeated Eintracht Frankfurt with a 5–0 victory. On 27 November, Robben scored two goals in a 5–1 win against S.L. Benfica in the Champions League. On 2 December, Robben said in an interview &quot;I can say that this is my last year [at Bayern] and it is good like that. I think it is the right moment after ten years. The club moves on and I may move on. It is the end of a very good and long period.&quot;

On 18 May 2019, he scored his last league goal for Bayern in Bundesliga making it a 5–1 victory against Frankfurt, which meant Bayern winning their 28th Bundesliga title and Robben winning his eighth. On 25 May 2019, Robben won his fifth DFB-Pokal as Bayern defeated RB Leipzig 3–0 in the 2019 DFB-Pokal Final. He finished the 2018–19 season with six goals in 19 appearances. In 201 Bundesliga matches he scored 99 goals.

On 4 July 2019, Robben announced his decision to retire from football.

=== Return to Groningen ===
On 27 June 2020, Robben announced his return to the game, signing with FC Groningen, the club he started his career with, in an effort to help the team recover from COVID-19 setbacks. He scored his first goal for Groningen in a pre-season friendly against Arminia Bielefeld. On 13 September 2020, he made his league debut for Groningen against PSV, but he was substituted after only 28 minutes due to injury. After a nearly seven-month absence, he made his return as a substitute in a loss to SC Heerenveen on 11 April 2021. Robben returned in Groningen&#x27;s starting line-up on 9 May; he provided two assists in a 4–0 win at Emmen.

On 15 July 2021, Robben announced his second and final retirement from professional football.

== International career ==
In April 2003, he made his Netherlands international debut in a friendly match against Portugal at age 19.

=== Euro 2004 ===
Robben&#x27;s first participation at an international tournament came at UEFA Euro 2004 when manager Dick Advocaat called up younger players, such as Wesley Sneijder and John Heitinga. During the group stage of the tournament, Advocaat substituted Robben in the 66th minute to defend a 2–1 lead over the Czech Republic. The Czechs, however, then scored two goals and won 3–2, which led to criticism about Advocaat&#x27;s decision. In the quarter-finals, Robben scored the deciding kick in the penalty shootout between the Netherlands and Sweden, which ensured that at the fifth attempt, the Dutch finally won a shootout.

=== 2006 World Cup ===
Robben played in his first 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier in 2006. In six games for the Netherlands, Robben scored two goals. The Netherlands qualified for the 2006 World Cup and in their opening match against Serbia and Montenegro, Robben scored the winning goal in the 18th minute, and was named the Player of the match. In the match against the Ivory Coast, Robben received this award the second time, thus becoming one of the eight players in the tournament to have won multiple Man of the Match awards.

=== Euro 2008 ===

During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten changed the side&#x27;s formation to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle for a position with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged the ball out of reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder and he ran at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.

=== 2010 World Cup ===
Robben was selected by new manager Bert van Marwijk for the final 23-man Dutch squad for the 2010 World Cup. In the team&#x27;s last friendly match against Hungary, just before its flight to South Africa on 4 June, Robben fell awkwardly and picked up a hamstring injury, causing concern over his fitness for the tournament. On 5 June, Van Marwijk announced that he had &quot;decided not to summon any substitute for Arjen. I want to give him every chance to still participate in the World Cup&quot;. On 12 June, Robben arrived in South Africa to join the team. He was an unused substitute for the opening match against Denmark as they coasted to a 2–0 victory, and again in the 1–0 victory against Japan. He came on in the 73rd minute against Cameroon in their 2–1 victory, hitting the post from which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the rebound.

On 28 June 2010, Robben started his first match against Slovakia in which he went on to score the first goal in the second round as the Netherlands won 2–1. He also won the man of the match award. Robben scored the third goal with a well-placed header in the semi-finals against Uruguay which the Netherlands won 3–2 to reach the final. Robben played for the full match in the final as the Netherlands lost 1–0 to Spain. Robben had Netherlands&#x27;s best opportunity of the match when played in on goal by Wesley Sneijder in the 62nd minute of the match, but was denied by Iker Casillas. Robben was nominated for the 2010 World Cup Golden Ball, the tournament&#x27;s best player, which was won by Diego Forlán.

=== Euro 2012 ===
Robben was selected to play for the Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because he thought he could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.

=== 2014 World Cup ===
In the Netherlands&#x27; first match of the 2014 World Cup, Robben scored two goals in a 5–1 win over Spain. In the Netherlands&#x27; second group stage match, a 3–2 win over Australia, Robben scored the team&#x27;s opening goal as they qualified for the knockout stage. In the round of 16 knock-out match with Mexico, the Netherlands won on a penalty awarded after Robben went down following a challenge from Rafael Márquez. The Associated Press said that Robben&#x27;s &quot;theatrical&quot; fall &quot;did little to defuse the debate about his reputation for diving&quot;. Robben maintained that the penalty was correct but admitted to falling easily earlier in the match, telling a Dutch TV channel that &quot;the one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn&#x27;t be doing that&quot;.

In the quarter-final, Robben scored the Netherlands&#x27; second kick in a 4–3 penalty shootout defeat of Costa Rica. On 11 July, Robben was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA&#x27;s Golden Ball award for the tournament&#x27;s best player.

On 28 August 2015, Robben was named captain of the Netherlands, replacing Robin van Persie.

=== 2018 World Cup ===
On 10 October 2017, Robben retired from international football after the team&#x27;s unsuccessful 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. He collected 96 caps between 2003 and 2017 for the &quot;Oranje&quot; and scored 37 goals.

== Style of play ==
Throughout most of his career, Robben was regarded as one of the best wingers in the world, with ESPN stating he is &quot;able to take on and beat defenders at the drop of a hat, Robben&#x27;s ability to get to the byline and deliver in accurate crosses instils fear into any defence&quot;. Usually deployed on the right wing, Robben employs his signature move by cutting inside on his stronger left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal. Robben had a noticeable preference for using his dominant foot throughout his career: he scored 134 league goals with his left foot, while only ten league goals came with his weaker right foot.

During the course of a match Robben would often drift to the left wing, with his teammate, in the case of Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is his relationship with the right-sided full-back. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm had benefits for the team&#x27;s efficiency and chemistry. Robben&#x27;s defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracked back and covered for his partner when he pushed forward and became a temporary right back.

Robben has been often accused of diving, and he has at times openly admitted to the charges. In December 2011, Robben apologised for a dive against VfL Bochum in a DFB-Pokal match which earned him a yellow card, saying, &quot;I must not do things like this.&quot; In July 2014, Robben admitted to diving in the first half of Netherlands&#x27; match against Mexico in the last 16 round of the 2014 World Cup, but maintained that he had not dived for the decisive penalty he won in stoppage time which Netherlands converted to win 2–1. Following the incident, Robben&#x27;s former manager at Chelsea, José Mourinho, said that Robben&#x27;s speed and creativity cause opponents who cannot stop him to foul him, but &quot;sometimes [Robben] tries to get an advantage, or to get a penalty&quot;. Earlier in his career, he also drew criticism from pundits and other players for his perceived selfishness, his lack of composure in important games, and for his struggles with injuries throughout his career, which were initially thought to have limited his potential; however, he worked to develop his physique and the mental aspect of his game, and became a more consistent and world class team player as his career progressed, who was known for providing a good number of assists as well as scoring goals himself.

== Personal life ==

Robben married his girlfriend Bernadien Eillert on 9 June 2007 in Groningen. The two met while in high school in the city, at the Kamerlingh Onnes, and have two sons, Luka (born 2008) and Kai (born 2012) and a daughter, Lynn (born 2010). Robben&#x27;s father, Hans, works as his agent.

== Sponsorship ==
Robben has a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas. Robben featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series before his retirement, and was the third-highest-rated player in &quot;FIFA 15&quot;.

He was the son of Feodor Petrovich Lvov, who was Maestro of the Imperial Chapel in St Petersburg from 1826 to 1836 (having succeeded Bortniansky). Lvov codified the traditional Russian liturgical musical style called &quot;Obikhod,&quot; which is the standard repertory of most Russian Orthodox churches in the world. It is a simple style. These melodies were later edited and improved by Bakhmetev.

Alexei Fyodorovich began violin lessons at a very young age and performed regularly in concerts given at his home: for instance, at 9 he was the soloist in a performance of a violin concerto by Viotti. Although he had a number of teachers in his youth, from the age of 19 onwards he began to study independently, seeking to develop his own personal style through careful attention to the works of such celebrated violinists as Corelli, Tartini, Viotti, Kreutzer and Rode. He nevertheless continued to study composition formally under the supervision of I. G. Miller (who was also one of the teachers of Glinka).

Outside the world of music, his general education had a technical emphasis. In 1818, he completed his studies at the Institute of Communications, and embarked on a career as a civil engineer in the Imperial Army, eventually attaining the rank of general. In 1828, he was appointed Aide-de-camp to Tsar Nicholas I.

Lvov formed a string quartet in St Petersburg, and organised weekly concerts at his private residence, which were attended by members of high society. At these concerts it was quite usual for there to be guest performances by distinguished musicians who were visiting the Russian capital; among these were Liszt, Robert and Clara Schumann, and Berlioz. His quartet undertook a number of tours in Europe, where Lvov was able to perform to public audiences (in his home country he was able to play only to private audiences owing to his elevated social rank). He also counted Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer and Spontini amongst his personal friends.

In 1837, Lvov succeeded his father as Maestro of the Imperial Chapel, remaining in the position until 1861. In 1850, he founded the Russian Concert Society (Русское концертное общество), which was among the pioneers of symphonic concerts in Russia. In 1867, with the onset of deafness, he was obliged to withdraw from musical activity.

As a composer, Lvov&#x27;s style was eclectic. He combined the traditions of Russian musical culture with strong Italian and (especially) German influences.

Lvov was married, and had a son and two daughters.

He was entombed in the Pažaislis Monastery, Kaunas (Lithuania).

<text>Match grade frequently refers to quality firearm parts and ammunition that are suitable for a competitive match. Sometimes it also refers to other devices and parts that are made with high precision in mind.

==Description==
In firearms, the term is used to refer to ammunition and gun parts that are designed and manufactured in such a way that they have a relatively narrow tolerance and high level of accuracy. No standards are defined for its qualification and as such it is more of a relative term. In addition to its use in shooting sports, match grade equipment is often employed by military and law enforcement sharpshooters.

Thus, many gun manufacturers use the term &quot;match grade&quot; to describe their products. For instance, the Heckler &amp; Koch Mark 23 weapons system is considered so specifically tooled for combat that it is match grade, one primary reason that the pistol and its components were selected by the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for service. The Springfield Armory XD-M (with &#x27;M&#x27; standing for match) features components that were more advanced than those of the regular XD pistol, such as sights and the barrel, which are deemed match grade. The magazines have extended capacities for target or combat shooting and the slide also has a more durable melonite finish. SIG Sauer released a line of self-defense ammunition, Elite Performance Ammunition, which they deem to be match grade, for increased performance and reliability.

Manufacturing match grade ammunition and other parts requires extremely tight tolerances and quality control. It is not unusual for match-grade ammunition and components to cost ten times more than comparable non-match equivalents, owing both to the increased labor expended in creation and much more rigorous testing. Match grade ammunition is often subjected to higher randomized testing to ensure consistency and accuracy, reducing the statistical likelihood of a dud round. Match grade components are often selected by testing the performance of multiple, identically configured firearms, and then eliminating those that don&#x27;t perform to expectation.

<text>Prince Georgy Yevgenyevich Lvov ( – 7/8 March 1925) was a Russian aristocrat, statesman and the first prime minister of the Russian Republic from 15 March to 20 July 1917. As Russia&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; head of state, he led the Provisional Government after the February Revolution led to the suspension of the Russian monarchy.

A member of the Lvov princely family, Lvov was born in Dresden, Germany, and gained national fame for his relief work in the Russian Far East during the Russo-Japanese War. In 1906, he was elected to the First Duma as a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party. After the February Revolution, Lvov was made head of the Provisional Government and oversaw a number of liberal reforms. A series of political crises ultimately brought down his government, and in July 1917 he resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by his war minister, Alexander Kerensky. After the October Revolution, Lvov was arrested by the Bolsheviks, but later escaped to France by way of the United States. He settled in Paris and died in 1925.

==Early life and education==
Georgy Lvov was born on 2 November 1861 (21 October, Old Style, Julian calendar) in Dresden, Saxony, then part of the German Confederation. The Lvov princely family were among the oldest Russian noble families, tracing their roots from the sovereign Rurik dynasty princes of Yaroslavl. His father was a reform-minded liberal who spent almost all his income on his children&#x27;s education; Lvov and his five brothers were sent off to the most prestigious Moscow schools. Throughout his youth, Georgy lived with his family at their ancestral home at Popovka in Tula Governorate, less than away from Moscow and only a few miles away from Yasnaya Polyana, the home of writer Leo Tolstoy. The Lvovs counted Tolstoy as one of their closest friends.

By the standards of the Russian noble class, the Lvovs lived a frugal lifestyle. Luxuries were minimal and their estate was considered small at only . The Lvovs generated massive debts in excess of around 150,000 roubles by the end of the 1870s. With the abolition of serfdom, they fell into the category of landowners who did not have the means to live in the manner to which many other Russian nobles had been accustomed. In order to pay off their arrears, the family were forced to sell their other landed estates, a brewery in Bryansk, and their flat in Moscow. Despite this, they remained heavily in debt and were faced with the prospect of either having to sell Popovka or convert it into a profitable farm. The Lvovs opted for the latter, with Georgy later recalling: &quot;The idea of giving up the home of our ancestors was unthinkable&quot;. The farm at Popovka had become so dilapidated after decades of neglect that it required strenuous work to restore it. By this time his father was too ill to work, leaving Georgy&#x27;s four older brothers and only sister to take charge of the farm while he studied law at the University of Moscow. The family laid off all their servants and lived like peasants ― Lvov would later recall this time as a source of his own emancipation: &quot;It separated us from the upper crust and made us democratic&quot;. As a result of their labour, all debts were repaid by the late 1880s and their ancestral home saved.

In 1899, Prince Lvov married a Hungarian-born portrait painter Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy in Prague; they were quickly divorced, though Vilma continued to style herself the &quot;Princess Lwoff-Parlaghy&quot; using her artist name with the authorization of Prince Lvov. The prince also continued to provide her with a permanent annual allowance.

Lvov was also married to Countess Julia Alexeievna Bobrinskaya (1867–1903), great-great-granddaughter of Grigory Orlov and Catherine the Great, without issue. They met whilst Lvov was working in a soup kitchen in Tambov Governorate during the Russian famine of 1891–1892.

==Pre-revolution==
===Russo-Japanese War===

With the outbreak of war between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire in January 1904, the provincial zemstvos were mobilised to assist with the war effort. To help the Red Cross on the Manchurian front, thirteen zemstvos formed a combined medical brigade consisting of 360 doctors and nurses, led by Lvov. This marked the first time that zemstvos had been allowed to organise themselves at a national level after their powers had been restricted by Alexander III in 1890. Lvov had pleaded with Tsar Nicholas to let the brigade go; the tsar was so moved by his patriotic sentiment that he ended up hugging and kissing him and wished him well. The relief mission, which won high praise from Russian military leaders, turned Lvov into a national hero and enabled the zemstvos to reintegrate themselves into Russian governing society.

===Revolution of 1905===
A year later he won election to the First Duma, and was nominated for a ministerial position. He became chairman of the All-Russian Union of Zemstvos in 1914, and in 1915 he became a leader of the Union of Zemstvos as well as a member of Zemgor, a joint committee of the Union of Zemstvos and the Union of Towns that helped supply the military and tend to the wounded from World War I. In December 1916, after Prince Lvov&#x27;s tirades at the Congress of Zemstvos, the Voluntary Organisations would allow no one to work for the government unless their collaboration were purchased by political concessions.

==February Revolution==
On 14 January O.S. (27 January N.S.) Lvov proposed to Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich that he should take control of the country. At the end of January negotiations took place between the Allied powers in Petrograd; unofficially they sought to clarify the internal situation in Russia.

==Head of the provisional government==
During the February Revolution and the abdication of Nicholas II, emperor of Russia, Lvov was made head of the provisional government founded by the Duma on 2 March 1917.

During his first weeks as prime minister, Lvov presided over a series of fleeting reforms which sought to radically liberalise Russia. Universal adult suffrage was introduced, freedoms of press and speech were granted, capital punishment abolished, and all legal restrictions of religion, class and race were removed. In late March, a delegation of women suffragettes planned to lobby Lvov for the right of women to vote in local government elections. Expecting a strenuous battle, the suffragettes were shocked to learn that Lvov had already granted women the right to vote, saying &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t women vote? [...] Surely, with universal suffrage there can be no reason to exclude women&quot;. Lvov&#x27;s reforms helped create a new culture of democracy in Russia. One peasant from Penza province changed his surname to Lvov, and another to &#x27;Demakratov&#x27;.

Unable to rally sufficient support, he resigned in July 1917 in favour of his Minister of War, Alexander Kerensky. 

After the October Revolution he settled in Tyumen. In the winter of 1917 he was arrested and transferred to Yekaterinburg. Three months later, Lvov and two other prisoners (Lopukhin and Prince Nikolai Golitsyn) were released before the court under a written undertaking not to leave the place. The local war commissar, Filipp Goloshchekin, intended to execute Lvov and the other prisoners, but was ordered not to by Isaac Steinberg, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Justice, a Left-Socialist Revolutionary while they were still in coalition with the Bolsheviks. Lvov immediately left Yekaterinburg, made his way to Omsk, occupied by the anti-Bolshevik Czechoslovak Legion. The Provisional Siberian Government, headed by Pyotr Vologodsky, was formed in Omsk and instructed Lvov to leave for the United States (since it was believed that this country was capable of providing the fastest and most effective assistance to anti-Bolshevik forces) to meet with President Woodrow Wilson and other statesmen to inform them on the aims of the anti-Soviet forces and receiving assistance from former allies of Russia in the First World War. In October 1918 he travelled to the United States but was late as in November of the same year the First World War ended and preparations began for the peace conference in Paris, where the centre of world politics moved.

Having failed to achieve any practical results in the United States, Lvov departed to France, where in 1918–1920 he was at the head of the Russian political meeting in Paris. He was at the source of the labor exchanges system to help Russian emigrants, transferred to their disposal the funds of Zemgor, stored in the National Bank of the United States. Later he left politics, living in Paris in poverty, working at handicraft and writing his memoirs. Georgy Lvov died in Paris, France on 7 March 1925 at the age of 63.

==Memorials==
There is a memorial to Prince Lvov in Aleksin as well as a small exhibition on him in the town museum. In Popovka there is another memorial opposite his local church and a plaque on the wall of the local school he founded. He died in Boulogne-sur-Seine and is buried in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery in France.

A relative of his by the name of Prince Andre Nikita Lwoff (1901–1933), variously described as either Georgy Lvov&#x27;s son or nephew, is buried in the old cemetery in Menton, France.

==Further reading==
Lvov wrote an autobiography, &#x27;Воспоминания&#x27; (&quot;Memories&quot;), while in exile and a biography was also written in 1932 by Tikhon Polner entitled &#x27;Жизненный путь князя Георгія Евгеніевича Львова. Личность. Взгляды. Условія дѣятельности&#x27; (&quot;The Life Course of Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov. Personality. Views. Conditions of Activity&quot;). Neither has been translated but both have been reprinted and are still available in Russian.

==Notes==

Note on transliteration: An older French form, Lvoff, is used on his tombstone. Georgy can be written as Georgi and is sometimes seen in its translated form, George or Jorge.

<text>Francis Howard Greenway (20 November 1777 – September 1837) was an English-born architect who was transported to Australia as a convict for the alleged crime of forgery. He became known as the ‘forefather of Australian architecture’. In New South Wales he worked for the Governor, Lachlan Macquarie, as Australia&#x27;s first government architect. He became widely known and admired for his work displayed in buildings such as St Matthew&#x27;s Church, St James&#x27; Church and Hyde Park Barracks.

==Life and career==
Greenway was born in Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire (near the English city of Bristol), the son of Francis Greenway and Ann Webb. Greenway became an architect &quot;of some eminence&quot; in Bristol and Bath. His only remaining building in the United Kingdom is the Clifton Club in Bristol, originally the Clifton Hotel and Assembly Rooms. In 1809 he became bankrupt and in 1812 he pleaded guilty &quot;under the advice of his friends&quot;, to forging a financial document, and was sentenced to death; this sentence was later commuted to 14 years&#x27; transportation. Why he pleaded guilty is unknown; he may have been told it was the only way to save his life. Whilst awaiting deportation to Sydney, Greenway spent time in Newgate Prison, Bristol, where he completed paintings depicting scenes within the prison.

Greenway arrived in Sydney, New South Wales on the transport &quot;General Hewitt&quot; in February 1814 to serve his sentence. On board the ship was the surgeon Dr John Harris who was to give Greenway his first private commission in the colony which involved extending his residence on his Ultimo estate. Greenway first met Lachlan Macquarie in July 1814 to whom he had come recommended by Admiral Arthur Phillip. During the initial meeting Macquarie sought to test Greenway by asking him to copy a design of a town hall and courthouse from a pattern book. Greenway was so offended by this that he responded with a letter declaring his skills and quoting Sir William Chambers that Macquarie should utilise the opportunity for a classical design, saying he would &quot;immediately copy the drawing Your Excellency requested me to do, notwithstanding it is rather painful to my mind as a professional man to copy a building that has no claim to classical proportion and character.&quot;

Between 1816 and 1818, while still a convict, Greenway was responsible for the design and construction of the Macquarie Lighthouse on the South Head 2km from the entrance to Port Jackson. After the success of this project he was emancipated by the governor Lachlan Macquarie, before breakfast on 16 December 1817 at the Lighthouse. In the role of Acting Civil Architect and Assistant Engineer responsible to Captain J. M. Gill, Inspector of Public Works, went on to build many significant buildings in the new colony.

Greenway’s works include Hyde Park Barracks, extensions to First Government House, the stables for a projected new Government House (condemned for their ‘useless magnificence’ by a visiting British official, the building is now home to the Sydney Conservatorium of Music), and St James&#x27; Church, Sydney, which was chosen as one of Australia’s only two man-made ‘treasures’ by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC series &quot;Around the World in 80 Treasures&quot;. He submitted designs for the first Catholic church in Sydney, St Mary&#x27;s but they did not match the ambitious scale envisaged by the priest Fr Therry, and were not proceeded with.

Greenway fell into disrepute when Macquarie accused him of charging high fees whilst on a government retainer, and he was dismissed by the next governor, Thomas Brisbane, in 1822. He continued to follow his profession with little success.

In 1835 he was destitute, advertising in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; that &quot;Francis Howard Greenway, arising from circumstances of a singular nature is induced again to solicit the patronage of his friends and the public&quot;.

Greenway died of typhoid near Newcastle, New South Wales in 1837, aged 59. The exact date of his death is not known. He is believed to have been buried in the Glebe burial ground at East Maitland on 25 September 1837, but his grave is unmarked.

==Posthumous tributes==

Ironically, despite conviction for the forgery of a financial document, Greenway&#x27;s face was shown on the first Australian decimal-currency $10 note (1966–93), making him probably the only convicted forger in the world to be honoured on a banknote.

Greenway is the eponym of a NSW Federal electorate, a suburb of Canberra, and a high school in Woodberry, a suburb of Maitland.

Francis Greenway Drive in the suburb of Cherrybrook is named in honour of Francis Greenway.

The Vaucluse home of the renowned Australian architect Leslie Wilkinson (1882–1973) was named ’Greenway’ in honour of Francis Greenway.

A Correctional Centre complex near Windsor, NSW is called the Francis Greenway Complex.

<text>Richard Wall Lyman (October 18, 1923 – May 27, 2012), the seventh president of Stanford University, was an American educator, historian, and professor.

== Biography ==
An historian of the British Labour Party, Lyman spent two years at the London School of Economics in 1951 and 1952, researching for his PhD on the first Labour Government. He spent the period 1954-1958 teaching at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1957 his PhD was published as a book, entitled &quot;The First Labour Government, 1924&quot;. He joined Stanford in 1958.

He served as the provost of Stanford between 1967 and 1970. He then served as president of the university from 1970 to 1980. During his tenure as provost and president, he confronted campus dissidents involved in protests against the Vietnam war and other social issues of the 1960s. In the spring of 1969, he called in law enforcement authorities to evict and arrest students who were occupying campus buildings and removing administrative files. In referring to his leadership during his tenure, both of his immediate successors as president of the university have said that &quot;Dick Lyman saved Stanford.&quot;

Lyman was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971.

In 1983 he founded the Stanford Institute for International Studies and became its first director. He was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1980 to 1988.

In 1998, Lyman was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Lyman earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Swarthmore College and his master&#x27;s degree and PhD from Harvard University. He was a Fulbright scholar at the London School of Economics from 1951 to 1952. He came to Stanford in 1958 as a professor in history.

The Richard W. Lyman Award was established in 2002 by the National Humanities Center in honor of Lyman. He posthumously won the 2011 Alumni Achievement Award from Hamden Hall Country Day School.

He married Jing (1925-2013) in 1947 and they have four children. Jing Lyman was herself very active in the university and supported the founding of the Center for Research on Women (now the Clayman Institute for Gender Studies) in 1974. She was a &quot;leading national figure in initiatives promoting fairer housing, community development and women’s economic empowerment.&quot; His granddaughter is radio producer Tina Antolini.

The Lyman Graduate Residence built in 1997 on the west side of campus is named for Richard Lyman and the Jing Lyman Commons Building within it for his wife.

He died in 2012 of heart failure, aged 88.

<doc id="756469" wikidata="Q1601853" url="?curid=756469" title="Helen Lynd">
<text>Helen Merrell Lynd (March 17, 1896 – January 30, 1982) was an American sociologist, social philosopher, educator, and author. She is best known for conducting the first Middletown studies of Muncie, Indiana, with her husband, Robert Staughton Lynd; as the coauthor of &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929) and &quot;Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts&quot; (1937); and a pioneer in the use of social surveys. She was also the author of &quot;England in the 1880s: Toward a Social Basis for Freedom&quot; (1945), &quot;On Shame and the Search for Identity&quot; (1958), and essays on academic freedom. In addition to writing and research, Lynd was a lecturer at Vassar College, and a professor at Sarah Lawrence College from 1929 to 1964.

==Early life and education==
Helen Merrell was born in La Grange, Illinois, on March 17, 1896. Merrill studied philosophy at Wellesley College, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1919. She began teaching at a New York City boarding school, but left the position after two years to begin graduate studies at Columbia University. Merrell earned a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University in the History of Ideas in 1922 and a Ph.D. degree in history and philosophy from Columbia in 1944.

==Marriage and family==
Helen Merrell met Robert Staughton Lynd while hiking Mount Washington in New Hampshire. They married in 1921. Robert Lynd died on November 1, 1970.

The couple had two children, a son, Staughton Lynd, who became a historian and social activist, and a daughter, Andrea Merrell (Lynd) Nold.

==Career==
Helen Merrell began her career as an educator in New York City, but after her marriage to Robert Lynd and earning a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University, she became a sociologist, author, and college professor.

===First Middletown study===
In 1924, Helen and Robert Lynd moved to Muncie, Indiana, to begin an eighteen-month study of daily life in this small, Midwestern community. John D. Rockefeller Jr. funded the research as part of the Institute for Social and Religious Research&#x27;s Small City Study. The Lynds and their three-person staff primarily observed the social lives of the city&#x27;s inhabitants. The study compared life in Muncie in 1890 to Muncie in 1924, with the goal of measuring the impact of the Industrial Revolution on American life. The Lynds provided details of their observations and analysis of their findings in &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929), which they coauthored. It was the first sociological study of an American community and became a classic work in the field.

Reviewers praised &quot;Middletown&#x27;s&quot; &quot;careful research and is scientific character,&quot; but its popularity was due to the authors&#x27; detailed descriptions of American life. However, because of the study&#x27;s primary focus on Muncie&#x27;s Protestant, white community, the book also received strong criticism for its failure to include details of other racial and ethnic segments of the community. Despite the negative comments the book received positive reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. The book&#x27;s success also launched the Lynds&#x27; academic careers. Helen and Robert Lynd coauthored &quot;Middletown in Transition&quot; (1937), a sequel to their first book on Muncie that became another sociological classic, but plans for a third Middletown book did not develop. Instead, the Lynds turned to other scholarly interests.

===Professor, author, and essayist===
Helen Lynd became a lecturer at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and from 1929 to 1964, a faculty member at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. She also continued to author books, such as &quot;England in the 1880s: Toward a Social Basis for Freedom&quot; (1945) and &quot;On Shame and the Search for Identity&quot; (1958), in addition to writing articles on academic freedom.

The model of shame that Lynd advocated in her book, &quot;On Shame and the Search for Identity&quot; (1958), is loosely Marxian, insisting upon &quot;the importance of historical context and of transcultural analysis within single social formations&quot; (particularly Western). Her theory of shame hinges upon the clashing of different social or moral &#x27;values&#x27; in specific locations at specific moments, highlighting the trauma experienced by members of communities marginal to dominant culture: those most likely to feel shame are those made to feel &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; by dominant cultural norms.&quot;

During the era of McCarthyism in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Helen and Robert Lynd were the subjects of federal investigations for alleged involvement in the Communist party. Helen Lynd testified before the U.S. Congress in 1953.

==Death and legacy==
Helen Lynd died on January 30, 1982, in Warren, Ohio, at the age of eighty-five.

Helen and Robert Lynd&#x27;s legacy stems from their Middletown studies and detailed descriptions of small-town life in Muncie, Indiana, the first systematic sociological study of a community in the United States. The Lynds were pioneers in the use of social surveys in their research.

Helen and Robert Lynd coauthored two books that became classics of American sociology: &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929) and &quot;Middletown in Transition&quot; (1937). Robert B. Downs included &quot;Middletown&quot; as one of the twenty-five he listed in &quot;Books That Changed America&quot; (1970).

Helen and Robert Lynds&#x27; pioneering work also began an on-going tradition of studying Muncie, Indiana, including the establishment of the Center for Middletown Studies in 1980. (The Center became affiliated with Ball State University in 1984.) Beginning with Frederick Lewis Allen in the 1930s, scholars have followed the Lynds pioneering efforts by producing numerous articles and books. More recent Middletown studies continue to examine modern life in Muncie with the hope that research on this particular Indiana community will provide a &quot;better understanding of modern American life.&quot; Later Middletown studies have resulted in the publication of additional books, including &quot;Middletown Families&quot; (1982) and &quot;All Faithful People&quot; (1983), and films, such as the six-part documentary, &quot;Middletown&quot;, which aired on PBS in 1982, and &quot;The First Measured Century&quot;, first broadcast on PBS in 2000.

<text>Robert Staughton Lynd (September 26, 1892 – November 1, 1970) was an American sociologist and professor at Columbia University, New York City. He is best known for conducting the first Middletown studies of Muncie, Indiana, with his wife, Helen Lynd; as the coauthor of &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929) and &quot;Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts&quot; (1937); and a pioneer in the use of social surveys. He was also the author of &quot;Knowledge for What? The Place of the Social Sciences in American Culture&quot; (1939). In addition to writing and research, Lynd taught at Columbia from 1931 to 1960. He also served on U.S. government committees and advisory boards, including President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Research Committee on Social Trends and President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Consumers&#x27; Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration. Lynd was also a member of several scientific societies.

==Early life and education==
Robert Staughton Lynd was born in New Albany, Indiana, on September 26, 1892, 
to Staughton and Cornelia Day Lynd. Robert Lynd received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University 1914. In the years 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1933 he attended classes at the New School for Social Research. From September 1920 to 1923 Lynd attended the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he received a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1923. Lynd received a Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia University in 1931 using an abridged version of &quot;Middletown&quot; as his dissertation.

==Marriage and family==
Robert Lynd met Helen Merrell while hiking Mount Washington in New Hampshire. They married in 1921. Helen Lynd died on January 30, 1982.

The Lynds had two children, a son, Staughton Lynd, who became a lawyer, historian, and social justice activist, and a daughter, Andrea Merrell (Lynd) Nold.

==Career==
===Early years===
In 1914 Lynd began working as an assistant editor at &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in New York City, before leaving in 1918 to serve in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during World War I. After the war Lynd was an advertising and publicity manager at Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons for about a year, then began work in 1920 as an assistant publisher for B. W. Huebsch, Inc. and joined the staff of the &quot;Freeman&quot;.

In 1921 Lynd was a divinity student at Union Theological Seminary, and for a summer he work as a church missionary in Elk Basin, Wyoming, the site of several oil camps. Afterwards Lynd wrote &quot;Done in Oil,&quot; an exposé critical of the conditions in the camps. The essay and his community work brought Lynd to the attention of the Rockefeller family. (John D. Rockefeller Jr. tried unsuccessfully to block publication of the essay, but held no grudge against Lynd for writing it.) In 1923 Rockefeller agreed to let the Institute of Social and Religious Research hire Lynd as a director for its Small City Study. Lynd served as the director of the institute&#x27;s study, which Rockefeller funded, from 1923 to 1926. Lynd&#x27;s wife, Helen, joined the project that became better known as the Middletown studies as a coinvestigator.

===First Middletown study===
In 1924 Robert and Helen Lynd moved to Muncie, Indiana, to begin an eighteen-month study of daily life in this Midwestern community. The Lynds and their three-person staff primarily observed the social lives of the city&#x27;s inhabitants. The study compared life in Muncie in 1890 to Muncie in 1924, with the goal of measuring the effects of the Industrial Revolution on American life. The Lynds coauthored &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929) describing the details of their research in Muncie. It was the first sociological study of an American community and a classic work in the field.

&quot;Middletown&quot; was an immediate success, receiving positive reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, and launched the academic career of both Robert and Helen Lynd. Reviewers &quot;praised its careful research and its scientific character,&quot; but the book&#x27;s popularity was due to the coauthors&#x27; explanations of American life. Not all the reviews were positive. The book was strongly criticized for its failure to include a variety of racial and ethnic experiences. Instead, the Lynds focused on the city&#x27;s white and predominantly Protestant community.

===Researcher and professor===
In 1926 Lynd became assistant director of the Division of Educational Research at the Commonwealth Fund, then joined the Social Science Research Council in 1927 as a research supervisor and assistant to the chairman. He spent another four years, 1928 to 1931, as the council&#x27;s secretary.

In 1931 Lynd accepted a tenure-track position as Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, a position he held until 1960. While teaching at Columbia, Lynd began but never completed sociological studies concerning the impact that the Great Depression had on segments of the population in Manhattan, New York, and in Montclair, New Jersey.

===Second Middletown study===

Lynd returned to Muncie, Indiana, during the summer of 1935 to make additional observations of the city and to update earlier research. After returning to New York, Robert and Helen Lynd coauthored &quot;Middletown in Transition&quot; (1937). The sequel to their earlier work was more theoretical and not as popular among readers as &quot;Middletown&quot;. The sequel concluded that the community&#x27;s values and attitudes had not changed much since their earlier research. The tone of the second book was also more critical than the first. Although the Lynds considered a third volume on Middletown, their plans were never realized.

After the publication of two books on the Middletown studies, Lynd resumed his academic career as a social scientist and professor at Columbia University. He also resumed writing, which included &quot;Knowledge for What? The Place of Social Science in American Culture&quot; (1939).

In addition to teaching at the university, Lynd served on U.S. government committees and advisory boards, including President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Research Committee on Social Trends and President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Consumers&#x27; Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration. Lynd became a member of the advisory board&#x27;s executive committee in 1935. He was also a member of a number of scientific societies in the field of sociological anthropology and economics, such as the AAAS, the American Social Society, American Statistics Society, and American Economics Association.

==Potential Communist affiliations==
During the McCarthy era of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Robert and Helen Lynd were the subjects of U.S. government investigations for alleged involvement in the Communist party. Several individuals who were interviewed in 1942 in connection with Robert Lynd&#x27;s initial case believed that his political views were &quot;extremely liberal,&quot; but they did not believe that he was a party member.

==Later years==
Lynd continued to write in his later years, including two published essays, &quot;Power in the United States&quot; (1956), and &quot;Power in American Society as Resource and Problem&quot; (1957). He retired from teaching at Columbia University in 1960.

==Death and legacy==
Lynd died at Warren, Connecticut, on November 1, 1970, at the age of seventy-eight.

Robert and Helen Lynd are best known for their research and descriptions of small-town life during the groundbreaking &quot;Middletown studies of Muncie, Indiana, the first systematical, sociological study of a community in the United States. The Lynds were also pioneers in the use of social surveys in their research. Their detailed observations were documented in two books they coauthored, &quot;Middletown: A Study in Contemporary American Culture&quot; (1929) and &quot;Middletown in Transition&quot; (1937). Both book became classics of American sociology.

The Lynds&#x27; pioneering sociological work began a legacy of continued studies of Muncie, including the establishment of the Center for Middletown Studies in 1980. (The Center became affiliated with Ball State University in 1984.) Beginning with Frederick Lewis Allen in the 1930s, scholars have followed the Lynds&#x27; efforts, producing &quot;hundreds of books, articles, and films examining life in one small city in Indiana&quot; with the hope that their studies provide a &quot;better understanding of modern American life.&quot; Subsequent Middletown studies resulted in the publication of additional books, most notably &quot;Middletown Families&quot; (1982) and &quot;All Faithful People&quot; (1983). Other studies were filmed: the six-part documentary, &quot;Middletown&quot;, that aired on PBS in 1982, and &quot;The First Measured Century&quot;, first broadcast on PBS in 2000. A seventh part of &quot;Middletown&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot; (1982), was judged too controversial to broadcast, as it focused on the world of high school seniors, portraying changing mores, language and sexuality. It was later released on the independent circuit and widely praised.

== Lynd&#x27;s thought==
&quot;In Knowledge for What?&quot;, he argues that American culture holds outstanding and contradictory assumptions such as women being both &quot;the finest of God&#x27;s creatures&quot; while also considered inferior to men in term of reasoning power.

<text>Lembert Dome is a granite dome rock formation in Yosemite National Park in the US state of California. The dome soars above Tuolumne Meadows and the Tuolumne River and can be hiked starting at the Tioga Road in the heart of Tuolumne Meadows, west of the Tioga Pass Entrance to Yosemite National Park. The landform is an example of a rôche moutonnée with clear lee and stoss slopes.

Lembert Dome was named for John Baptist Lembert, sometimes erroneously spelled Lambert, who took up a homestead in a section of Tuolumne Meadows in 1885. The Wheeler Survey referred to it as Soda Springs Dome, and John Muir called it Glacier Rock.

Lembert Dome is near Puppy Dome, and is also close to Dog Dome.

Rock climbers can scale the face from the parking lot just off the Tioga Road, but hikers can simply walk up the back side or take the challenging steeper trek up the face starting from just east of the parking lot. Many technical free climbing routes have been put up.

<doc id="756479" wikidata="Q4969412" url="?curid=756479" title="British Airline Pilots' Association">
<text>The British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) is the professional association and registered trade union for UK pilots. BALPA represents the views and interests of pilots, campaigning on contractual, legal and health issues affecting its members and the flying public.

==Membership and governance==
BALPA represents 85% of all commercial pilots in the UK and represents over 10,000 members. These include helicopter winchmen and ground instructors. The association holds the largest collective resource of pilot qualification and experience in the UK.

BALPA is one of the founder members of the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations (IFALPA), which co-ordinates the views and opinions of well over 100,000 flight crew around the globe. In Europe, BALPA is a founding member of ECA, the European Cockpit Association. BALPA also works with the Civil Aviation Authority, the Department for Transport, the Department of Trade and Industry and many other bodies where pilots have an interest in being represented.

BALPA is governed by an Annual Delegate Conference (ADC) made up of representatives of the Company Councils and a National Executive Committee (NEC) composed of elected pilots. As well as generating policy and association strategy, the NEC ensures that the organization is run in an efficient, legal and responsible manner.

In December 2023 it was announced that a new General Secretary was appointed following an &quot;extensive and exhaustive recruitment process&quot;, resulting in the first woman to be elected into the role in BAPA&#x27;s history.

==Structure==
BALPA has recognition agreements with airlines in multiple sectors. BALPA members in each of these companies elect a Company Council that leads a community of members.

There are eleven sub-committees of the NEC; Flight Safety and Security, Accident Analysis and Prevention, Air Traffic Services Study Group, Ops Aviation Medicine Group, Occupational Health and Safety Group, Aircraft Design &amp; Operations/Aircraft Ground Environment, Security Group, Fatigue and Scheduling Group, Helicopter Affairs Committee, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Work Group and Retired Flight Crew Committee.

==Membership==
To qualify for Full Membership applicants must hold a current professional pilot licence or flight engineer licence issued by the UK or one of the JAA countries, be engaged in British commercial flying and be based in the UK or employed by a UK Company abroad. Alternatively members may qualify as a ground instructor or helicopter winchman employed in British commercial flying.

There are also membership categories available for overseas, retired, military, unemployed and trainee pilots.

==Industrial Activity==
BALPA campaigns on a wide variety of issues which affect pilots and the flying public.

===Air Passenger Duty===
Air Passenger Duty (APD) is the UK Government tax that is charged on all passengers departing from a UK airport. BALPA is an active member of the A Fair Tax on Flying campaign, a coalition of more than 30 leading travel and aviation organisations including airlines, airports, trade associations and destinations who believe that APD is too high and is doing growing damage to jobs, growth and the UK economic recovery.

===Casualisation===
Casualisation and the use of contract labour is a growing issue in the aviation industry. BALPA has been campaigning on this issue and have had success in formulating a New Entrant Contract that delivers significant improvements to those entering the profession at EasyJet. Driving casualisation out of the whole industry remains one of BALPA&#x27;s key priorities.

As part of its campaign to combat the growing use of contingent workers in the aviation industry, BALPA commissioned the Labour Research Department (LRD) in 2012 to work with the union to produce a booklet focusing on the use of contingent workers in airlines where BALPA is recognised. The booklet highlights the legal framework, in particular the Agency Workers Regulations, which became law in October 2011.

===Flight Time Limitations===
Flight Time Limitations exist to ensure the safe operation of commercial aircraft and to avoid the onset of pilot fatigue. Pilot fatigue is a state of serious tiredness and exhaustion that reduces a pilots ability to operate safely. 15-20% of fatal accidents related to human errors have listed pilot fatigue as a contributing factor. BALPA has continuously sought to protect high safety standards of Flight Time Limitations in the UK.

=== British Airways &quot;Fire and Rehire&quot; dispute ===
In summer of 2020, British Airways and its parent company International Airline Group announced a restructuring programme that included up to 12,000 redundancies, including 1,255 pilots. BALPA members eventually accepted a deal that included a temporary 20% pay cut and a reduced number (270) of compulsory redundancies.

==In popular culture==
BALPA was featured in the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; television episode &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; in which Eric Idle portrays the BALPA spokesman in the &#x27;Flying Lessons&#x27; sketch.

<doc id="756486" wikidata="Q1366849" url="?curid=756486" title="Vajrapani">
<text> (Sanskrit; Pali: Vajirapāṇi, &#x27;holder of the thunderbolt&#x27;, lit. meaning, &quot;Vajra in [his] hand&quot;) is one of the earliest-appearing bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism. He is the protector and guide of Gautama Buddha and rose to symbolize the Buddha&#x27;s power.

Vajrapāni is also called Chana Dorji and Chador and extensively represented in Buddhist iconography as one of the earliest three protective deities or bodhisattvas surrounding the Buddha. Each of them symbolizes one of the Buddha&#x27;s virtues: Manjushri manifests all the Buddhas&#x27; wisdom, Avalokiteśvara manifests all the Buddhas&#x27; immense compassion, and Vajrapāni protects Buddha and manifests all the Buddhas&#x27; power as well as the power of all five tathāgatas (Buddhahood of the rank of Buddha).
Vajrapāni is one of the earliest Dharmapalas of Mahayana Buddhism and also appears as a deity in the Pali Canon of the Theravada school. He is worshiped in the Shaolin Monastery, in Tibetan Buddhism and in Pure Land Buddhism (where he is known as Mahasthamaprapta and forms a triad with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara). Manifestations of Vajrapāni can also be found in many Buddhist temples in China, Taiwan and Japan as Dharma protectors guarding monastery and temple gates. Vajrapāni is also associated with Acala, where he is serenaded as the holder of the vajra.

==Etymology==
Vajrapāni, &quot;holder of the thunderbolt&quot;, is a compound word in Sanskrit in which &#x27;Vajra&#x27; means &quot;Diamond or Thunderbolt&quot;, and &#x27;pāni&#x27; literally means &quot;in hand&quot;.

==Forms==
In human form Vajrapāni is depicted holding the vajra in his right hand. He is sometimes referred to as a Dhyani-Bodhisattva, equivalent to Akshobhya, the second Dhyani Buddha. Acharya-Vajrapani is Vajrapani&#x27;s manifestation as Dharmapala, often seen sporting a third eye, ghanta (bell) and pāśa (lasso). He is sometimes represented as a yidam with one head and four hands in a form known as Nilambara-Vajrapani, carrying a vajra, and treading on personage lying on snakes. Mahacakra-Vajrapani, also a yidam, is depicted with three heads and six arms, carrying a vajra and snakes whilst treading on Brahmā and Maheśvara. He is often in union with his consort in yab-yum. Acala-Vajrapani is depicted with four heads, four arms and four legs carrying a sword, a lasso and vajra, treading on demons. Another depiction is in the form with the head, wings, and claws of Garuda. 
Vajrapāni&#x27;s expression is wrathful, and is often symbolised as a yaksha, to generate &quot;fear in the individual to loosen up his dogmatism.&quot; His outstretched right hand brandishes a vajra, &quot;symbolysing analytical knowledge (&quot;jñanavajra&quot;) that disintegrates the grasping of consciousness. Although he sometimes wears a skull crown, in most depictions he wears a five-pointed bodhisattva crown to depict the power of the five Dhyani Buddhas (the fully awakened state of the Buddha).

==Mantras==
The mantra &#x27; is associated with Vajrapāni. His Seed Syllable is &#x27;.

*Tibetan: ༄༅།། ཨོཾ་བཛྲ་པཱ་ཎི་ཧཱུྃ་ཕཊ།།

==Legends==

In early Buddhist legends, Vajrapāni is a minor deity who accompanied Gautama Buddha during his career as a wandering mendicant. In some texts, he is stated to be manifestation of Śakra, king of the Trāyastriṃśa heaven of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. As Śakra, it is said that he was present during the birth of Tathagata. As Vajrapāni he was the god who helped Gautama escape from the palace at the time of his renunciation. When Sakyamuni returned from Kapilavastu he is stated to have assumed eight forms of devas who escorted him.

According to Xuanzang, the Chinese monk and traveler, Vajrapāni vanquished a large serpent at Udyana. In another version it is stated that while the Nāgas came to worship the Buddha and hear his sermons, Vajrapāni assumed the form of a bird to deceive them so that they were not attacked by their deadly enemies, the Garudas.

At the parinirvana of the Buddha, Vajrapāni dropped his vajra in despair and rolled himself in the dust.

==Meaning==
Vajrapāni is seen as a manifestation of Vajradhara and the &quot;spiritual reflex&quot;, the Dhyani Bodhisattva of Akshobhya. On the popular level, Vajrapāni is the bodhisattva who represents the power of all the buddhas just as Avalokiteśvara represents their great compassion, and Mañjuśrī their wisdom. He is called the Master of Unfathomable Mysteries who upholds truth even in adversities of darkness and ignorance.

According to the &quot;Pañcaviṃsatisāhasrikā-&quot; and &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā&quot;s, any bodhisattva on the path to buddhahood is eligible for Vajrapāni&#x27;s protection, making them invincible to any attacks &quot;by either men or ghosts&quot;.

As Buddhism expanded in Central Asia and fused with Hellenistic influences into Greco-Buddhism, the Greek hero Heracles was adopted to represent Vajrapāni. In that era, he was typically depicted as a hairy, muscular athlete, wielding a short &quot;diamond&quot; club. Buddhaghosa associated Vajrapāni with the &quot;deva&quot; king Indra. Some authors believe that the deity depicted is actually Zeus, whose Classical attribute is the thunderbolt. The image of Vajrapani as a wrestler-like figure would eventually influence the statues of guardian deities in East Asia.

===In India===
During the Kushan Empire, Gandhara art depicted Vajrapani&#x27;s images in which he is shown primarily as a protector of Sakyamuni and not in the role of a bodhisattva. In the &quot;Indrasalaguha&quot; scenes, mountains form a part of his environment where his presence during the conversion of the naga Apalala is shown. In these depictions, he is shown wearing exclusive Western attire and always in the presence of other deities. The reliefs in this art form depict Vajrapani always present in the scenes where Buddha is converting people; his presence is shown when the Buddha confronts the opponents of the dharma like Mara before his enlightenment. Scenes of Sakyamuni competing with the heretics are also part of this art tradition. Scenes of Buddha using the vajra of Vajrapani as the &quot;magic weapon&quot; to perform miracles and propagate &quot;superiority of his doctrine&quot; are also common.

In the western group of caves of the Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad, Vajrapani is depicted as a bodhisattva with his vajra in a tableau, a votive panel of sculptural composition in which he in a standing posture (the only extant figure) over a lotus to the left of a Buddha in a &quot;dhyanasana&quot;. In this panel he is adorned with a tall crown, two necklaces, a snake armlet and holds the vajra in his left hand, and resting on a scarf tied across his hips. This close iconographic composition is at the entrance to the porch of cave 2 and in the incomplete porch of cave 1. Such votive carved panels with Vajrapani are also seen in the interior of the &quot;parikrama&quot; passage of cave 2, in which he is paired with other bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara. In this panel he has a crown in the form of a stupa with a scarf fastened over his left thigh.

In the eastern group of caves, at the entry to cave 6, Vajrapani is carved as a commanding persona in the form of a huge dvarapala, along with Avalokiteśvara. Here, he is flanked by a small attendant. He carries the *vajra*, a luminous weapon in his left hand, which rests on a scarf tied across his hip. His right arm is bent forward, and possibly once held a lotus, similar to Avalokiteśvara. Both figures at the entrance of cave 6 are depicted wearing crowns (&quot;makuṭa&quot;).

=== In China ===

In China, Vajrapāni, known as the &quot;vajra-holding god&quot; (執金剛神 &quot;Zhíjīngāng shén&quot;), is widely venerated in his dual manifestation as the &quot;vajra warriors&quot; (金剛力士 &quot;Jīngāng Lìshì&quot;) or &quot;Benevolent Kings&quot; (仁王 &quot;Rénwáng&quot;), two muscular guardian deities that usually stand at each side of the shanmen in Buddhist temples and monasteries. The statue on the right side is traditionally named &quot;Guhyapāda&quot; (密跡金剛 &quot;Mìjī jīngāng&quot;), while the one on the left is traditionally named &quot;Nārāyaṇa&quot; (那羅延天 Nàluóyán tiān), both of whom are dharmapalas in the Chinese Buddhist canon. In Chinese folk religion, they are also known as &quot;Generals Heng and Ha&quot; (哼哈二將 &quot;Hēnghā èrjiàng&quot;), so named because the right statue usually has its mouth open to pronounce the sound &quot;a&quot;, while the other usually has it closed to utter the sound &quot;heng&quot;. The two sounds are the start and end sounds in Sanskrit, symbolizing the basis of sounds and bearing the profound theory of Dharma. Guhyapāda, in particular, is also considered one of the Twenty Devas or Twenty-Four Devas in the Chinese Buddhist pantheon. In the Shaolin tradition, Vajrapāni is venerated as an avatar of Avalokiteśvara who manifested to protect the monastery during the Yuan dynasty.

=== In Japan ===
In Japan, Vajrapāni is called , the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; reading of his Chinese name. As in China, his image was the inspiration for the , the wrath-filled and muscular guardian of the Buddha, found at the entrance of many Buddhist temples.

Vajrapāni is also associated with ; the mantra for Fudō-myōō references him as the powerful wielder of the vajra. Though he is not a very popular form of statue worship in Japan, he is frequently depicted in diagrams (mandala). The sixth formation of the Womb Realm Mandala is called the &quot;Vajrapani enclosure&quot;, in which he is depicted in 20 different forms, with Vajrasattva as the presiding deity. In Japanese iconography he is depicted in red colour at the death of Buddha.

===In Indonesia===

In Indonesia, Vajrapani is depicted as a part of triad with Vairocana and Padmapani. A famous 3 metres tall stone statues of Vairocana, Padmapani, and Vajrapāni triad can be found in central chamber of Mendut temple, located around 3 kilometres east from Borobudur, Central Java. Both seated Padmapani and Vajrapani, regarded as the guardian of Buddha Vairocana, are depicted as a handsome well-built men with serene expression adorned with exquisite crown and jewelries. The statues are the fine example of the 9th century Central Javanese Sailendran art, which influenced the Buddhist art in Southeast Asia, including Srivijayan art of Sumatra and Malay Peninsula (Southern Thailand).

===In Cambodia===
In Cambodia, three monasteries dated to 953 AD are dedicated to the worship of the triad of the Buddha—Prajnaparamita and Vajrapani; image of Vajrapani with four arms is venerated in one of these monasteries. Also, in niches are standing images of Vajrapani carved with four or two arms on each of the four faces of monoliths found in Western Cambodia.

===In Nepal===

In Nepal, Vajrapani is depicted holding a vajra supported on a lotus with its stem held in the right hand while the left hand is shown in a posture of &quot;charity and argument&quot;. His paintings are in white colour.

===In Tibet===

In Tibet, Vajrapani is represented in many fierce forms. Some of the notable ones are: Vajrapani-Acharya (Dharamapala) in a human form with only one head with a third eye with hair raised and crowned by a skull with fiery expression. His neck is adorned with a necklace of snakes, and with waist band made of tiger skin covered with skulls. Stepping to the right, his lifted hand holds a vajra. When painted in blue colour the image is encircled by flames with images of small Garudas; Nilambara-Vajrapani with one head, with a third eye, a crown made of skull with four or six arms and in some cases with untidy hair bedecked with vajra and snake. Two hands are crossed to the breast in mystic posture (mudra), the second right hand is lifted up and carries a vajra. Stepping to the right, regally crowned and lying over a bed of snakes; in &quot;Achala-Vajrapani&quot; form he is shown with four heads, four arms and four legs adorned with symbols of vajra, sword, lasso and skull cup (kapala) and trampling over demons; Mahachakra-Vajrapani is a form with three heads and a third eye, and with six arms and two legs. The icon is adorned with symbols of vajra, snake with &quot;yum&quot; held in its main hands, and as shakti it to his left is shown holding a skull-cup (kapala) and &quot;grigug&quot; (chopper or hooked knife). The icon is shown stepping over Brahma on the right and on Shiva to the left; in the Thunderbolt-Wielder form known as &quot;snake charm form&quot; to protect from snake bites, he is depicted sitting on a lotus throne carried by peacocks. The right hand posture holds one end of rope noose to capture snake demons while the left hand held over the hips carries the other end of the noose. He is followed by two bodhisattvas—&quot;Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin, Effacer of Stains, and Samantabhadra, the Entirely Virtuous One&quot;. His adornments consist of a tall crown and snakes coiling his arms and ankles. In a painted form, usually in white colour &quot;crossed-vajra&quot; is held to the left raised above the accompanying Bodhisattvas but when painted in blue colour the left hand holds a double vajra; his Garuda form is with wings and claws or with human head with a beak or head with wings fully spread (his painted form is in blue colour). he may be trampling over a demon or dead naga (snake). In some images he is shown carrying a sword, a bottle in the shape of a gourd, a chopper or hands held in a prayer mode.

===In Vietnam=== 
In Vietnamese Buddhism, Vajrapani is considered the Dharma and is said to have eight Vajrapani, called Bát bộ kim cương. Sùng Thiện Diên Linh stele (built 1122) in Long Đọi Temple from the Lý dynasty mentioned eight. These eight Dharma protectors are often arranged in Vietnamese Buddhist temples as to protect the Dharma, followers and Buddhist worship facilities. The eight Dharma protectors have their own names:
* Thanh Trừ Tai
* Tích Độc Thần
* Hoàng Tùy Cầu
* Bạch Tịnh Thủy
* Xích Thanh Hỏa
* Định Trừ Tai
* Tử Hiền Thần
* Đại Thần Lực

Although they are eight, all eight are gathered into a unified group, divided into two rows, four in each row, not separated to worship.

==In literature and art==
Vajrapani holds a prominent position in the Buddhist canon and is identified as a yaksha leader who has become a full-scale bodhisattva. This, reflected through the Mahayana sutras has become an &quot;emblem of esoteric knowledge and the revealer of Buddhist Tantra&quot;. As a yaksha, he maintains a special relationship with mountains and caves. 

According to Buddhist scholar E. Lamotte, Vajrapani was the chief of the &quot;Guhayakas&quot; (&quot;genies des cavernes&quot;), who played an important role in Esoteric Buddhist and Brahmanical literature of India. Lamotte based his assessment on many textual passages which explained Vajrapani&#x27;s use of his magic vajra to shake mountains. 

The &quot;Mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya&quot; includes a narrative about how Vajrapani used his strength to destroy the boulder Devadatta used in his attempt to murder the Buddha. In the &quot;Sarvastivada vinaya vibhasha&quot;, Vajrapani protects the pradakshina path with his magic weapon. This association correlates with the presence of large images of Vajrapani in Cave 6 at Aurangabad, located at both the entrance and exit of the circumambulation passage.

==Stories==
===Conversion of Ambattha===
The Pāli Canon&#x27;s &quot;Ambattha Sutta&quot;, which challenges the rigid nature of caste system, tells of one instance of him appearing as a sign of the Buddha&#x27;s power. At the behest of his teacher, a young Brahmin named Ambatha visited the Buddha. Knowing the Buddha&#x27;s family to be the Shakya clan, who are caste, Ambattha failed to show him the respect he would a fellow Brahmin. When the Buddha questioned his lack of respect, Ambatha replied it was because the Buddha belongs to a &quot;menial&quot; caste. The Buddha then asked the Brahmin if his family was descended from a “Shakya slave girl”. Knowing this to be true, Ambatha refused to answer the question. Upon refusing to answer the question for a second time, the Buddha warned him that his head would be smashed to bits if he failed to do so a third time. Ambatha was frightened when he saw Vajrapāni manifest above the Buddha&#x27;s head ready to strike the Brahmin down with his thunderbolt. He quickly confirmed the truth and a lesson on caste ensues.

===Vajrapāni and Maheśvara===
A popular story tells how Vajrapāni kills Maheśvara, a manifestation of Shiva depicted as an evil being. The story occurs in several scriptures, most notably the &quot;Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṅgraha&quot; and the &quot;Vajrāpanyābhiṣeka Mahātantra&quot;. The story begins with the transformation of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra into Vajrapāni by Vairocana, the cosmic Buddha, receiving a vajra and the name &quot;Vajrāpani&quot;. Vairocana then requests Vajrapāni to generate his adamantine family in order to establish a mandala. Vajrapāni refuses because Maheśvara &quot;is deluding beings with his deceitful religious doctrines and engaging in all kinds of violent criminal conduct&quot;. Maheśvara and his entourage are dragged to Mount Meru, and all but Maheśvara submit. Vajrapāni and Maheśvara engage in a magical combat, which is won by Vajrapāni. Maheśvara&#x27;s retinue become part of Vairocana&#x27;s mandala, except for Maheśvara, who is killed, and his life transferred to another realm where he becomes a Buddha named &quot;Bhasmeśvaranirghoṣa&quot;, the &quot;Soundless Lord of Ashes&quot;.

According to Kalupahana, the story &quot;echoes&quot; the story of the conversion of Ambattha. It is to be understood in the context of the historical competition between Buddhist institutions and Shaivism.in south Asia and southeast Asia.

==Patron saint of Shaolin monastery==
In his book &quot;The Shaolin Monastery&quot; (2008), Prof. Meir Shahar notes Vajrapāni is the patron saint of the Shaolin Monastery. A short story appearing in Zhang Zhuo&#x27;s (660–741) Tang anthology shows how the deity had been venerated in the Monastery from at least the eighth century. It is an anecdotal story of how the Shaolin monk Sengchou (480-560) gained supernatural strength and fighting ability by praying to the Vajrapāni and being force-fed raw meat. Shaolin abbot Zuduan (1115–1167) erected a stele in his honor during the Song dynasty. It reads:

Instead of being considered a stand-alone deity, Shaolin believes Vajrapāni to be an emanation of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. The Chinese scholar A&#x27;De noted this was because the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; says Guanyin takes on the visage of whatever being that would best help pervade the dharma. The exact &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; passage reads: &quot;To those who can be conveyed to deliverance by the body of the spirit who grasps the &quot;vajra&quot; (Vajrapāni) he preaches Dharma by displaying the body of the spirit who grasps the &quot;vajra&quot;.&quot;

He was historically worshiped as the progenitor of their famous staff method by the monks themselves. A stele erected by Shaolin abbot Wenzai in 1517 shows the deity&#x27;s vajra-club had by then been changed to a &quot;gun&quot; staff, which originally &quot;served as the emblem of the monk&quot;. Vajrapāni&#x27;s yaksha-like Narayana form was eventually equated with one of the four staff-wielding &quot;Kinnara Kings&quot; from the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; in 1575. His name was thus changed from Narayana to &quot;Kinnara King&quot;. One of the many versions of a certain tale regarding his creation of the staff method takes place during the Yuan-era Red Turban Rebellion. Bandits lay siege to the monastery, but it is saved by a lowly kitchen worker wielding a long fire poker as a makeshift staff. He leaps into the oven and emerges as a monstrous giant big enough to stand astride both Mount Song and the imperial fort atop Mount Shaoshi (which are five miles apart). The bandits flee when they behold this staff-wielding titan. The Shaolin monks later realize that the kitchen worker was none other than the Kinnara King in disguise. Shahar notes the part of the kitchen worker might have been based on the actual life of the monk Huineng (638–713). In addition, he suggests the mythical elements of the tale were based on the fictional adventures of Sun Wukong from the Chinese epic &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. He compares the worker&#x27;s transformation in the stove with Sun&#x27;s time in Laozi&#x27;s crucible, their use of the staff, and the fact that Sun and his weapon can both grow to gigantic proportions.

Statues and paintings of kinnaras were commissioned in various halls throughout Shaolin in honor of his defeat of the Red Turban army. A wicker statue woven by the monks and featured in the center of the &quot;Kinnara Hall&quot; was mentioned in Cheng Zongyou&#x27;s seventeenth century training manual &quot;Shaolin Staff Method&quot;. However, a century later, it was claimed that the Kinnara King had himself woven the statue. It was destroyed when the monastery was set aflame by the KMT General Shi Yousan in 1928. A &quot;rejuvenated religious cult&quot; arose around kinnaras in the late twentieth century. Shaolin re-erected the shrine to him in 1984 and improved it in 2004.

<text>Sir Philip Woolcott Game (30 March 1876 – 4 February 1961) was a Royal Air Force commander, who later served as Governor of New South Wales and Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (London). Born in Surrey in 1876, Game was educated at Charterhouse School and entered the military at Royal Military Academy Woolwich, gaining his commission in 1895. Serving with the Royal Artillery, Game saw action in the Second Boer War and the First World War. After serving with distinction and bravery, Game transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in early 1916 serving as General Trenchard&#x27;s chief staff officer. Finishing the War as an acting major-general, Game remained in the Royal Air Force after the close of hostilities. Notably he served as Air Officer Commanding RAF India and Air Member for Personnel. He retired from the military in 1929, having reached the rank of air vice-marshal.

In March 1930, Game was appointed Governor of New South Wales, serving during a time of political instability and coming into conflict with the NSW Labor government over attempts to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council. Game dismissed the Government of Premier Jack Lang in May 1932. Ending his term in January 1935, Game returned to Britain and was appointed Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London. He held it during the tumultuous 1930s, the 1936 abdication crisis and the Second World War, before retiring at the end of the war in Europe in 1945. Between 1937 and 1949 he resided at Langham House, Ham Common, Surrey and was Vicar&#x27;s Warden at St. Andrews church. Retiring with his wife Gwendoline to his home in Kent, Game died in February 1961, aged 84.

==Early life and career==
Game was born in Streatham, Surrey, on 30 March 1876 to George Beale Game, a merchant from Broadway, Worcestershire, and his wife Clara Vincent. Before entering the army, he was educated at Charterhouse School. Following officer training at the Royal Military Academy Woolwich, Game was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 2 November 1895 into the Royal Artillery. Promoted to lieutenant on 2 November 1898 and further promoted to captain on 3 June 1901, he served in the Second Boer War and was mentioned in dispatches (including the final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902). As a young artillery captain he was made officer in charge of the gun carriage bearing the coffin of Queen Victoria at her funeral in February 1901. In July 1902, he was appointed divisional adjutant of the IX division Royal Field Artillery, stationed at Middelburg, Cape Colony. Following brief postings in India and Ireland, Game attended the Staff College, Camberley in 1910 and was posted as a General Service Officer (GSO) at the War Office. He later won the Royal United Services Institute Gold Medal Essay. On 11 August 1908 he married Gwendolen Hughes-Gibb, the daughter of Francis Hughes-Gibb of Dorset, and was promoted as a major on 15 February 1912.

Following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Game served on the front in France, including at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. In the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the Legion of Honour and the Order of the Crown of Italy and was five times Mentioned in Despatches. In early 1916 Game transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as a result of Hugh Trenchard&#x27;s request for an experienced staff officer to serve in his headquarters. Game transferred to the Royal Air Force on its creation in 1918. At the end of the war, Game continued to work under Trenchard, but as Director of Training and Organisation in the RAF. In 1922 he was promoted to the rank of air vice-marshal and appointed Air Officer Commanding RAF India. The next year he took up the post of Air Member for Personnel and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) a year later. Game retired suddenly on 1 January 1929, at the age of 52, allegedly owing to the rumours of his being appointed Chief of the Air Staff. On 1 March 1929 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in the military division (GBE).

==Governor of New South Wales==
At the height of the Great Depression, Game was appointed Governor of New South Wales in March 1930. He arrived in Sydney with his family in May 1930. On 30 June 1930, Game was appointed by King George V a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St John (KStJ). At the October 1930 State elections the Bavin Nationalist Government was defeated and the Labor Party leader, Jack Lang, became Premier.

===Legislative Council abolition===
Lang&#x27;s previous term of office from 1925 to 1927 had brought him into conflict with Game&#x27;s predecessor, Sir Dudley de Chair, over the proposed appointment of additional members to the Legislative Council, in order to enable the abolition of the house, using the same techniques used to abolish the Queensland Legislative Council in 1922. His inability to gain control in the Upper House obstructed Lang&#x27;s legislative programme and in November 1930, claiming a mandate to abolish the council, Lang&#x27;s Labor MLCs put forward two bills, one to repeal section 7A of the NSW Constitution (which prevented the abolition of the Council without a referendum), the other to abolish the council. Lang requested the necessary additional appointments to pass the legislation from Game. However, these requests were met with Game&#x27;s refusal.

Believing that a referendum was necessary before the bills could become law, the Legislative Council permitted the bills to pass without a division on 10 December. Lang then announced his intention of presenting the bills for Game&#x27;s Royal assent without a referendum. The following day, two members of the Legislative Council, Thomas Playfair and Arthur Trethowan, applied for and were granted an injunction preventing the president of the council, Sir John Peden, and the ministers from presenting the bills to the Governor without having held a referendum. On 23 December the Supreme Court of New South Wales in the case of &quot;Trethowan v Peden&quot;, upheld the injunction and ordered the government not to present for royal assent, unless ratified by the electors in a referendum, bills to abolish the council. Lang immediately prepared an appeal to the High Court of Australia. In the case of &quot;Attorney-General (New South Wales) v Trethowan&quot;, the appeal was rejected by a majority(3-2) of the court. Lang then appealed this decision to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. On 31 May 1932 the Privy Council dismissed the government&#x27;s appeal.

Reflecting his status as a representative of the British Government, Game at all times informed the Dominions Office of political developments. In hard financial times, NSW soon came into conflict with the federal government as Lang&#x27;s unorthodox financial policy opposed the economic orthodoxy advocated by Sir Otto Niemeyer, who was the main financial advisor to the Federal Scullin Labor government and later the Lyons United Australia Party Government. In July 1931, in a personal contribution towards economic recovery, Game notified Treasury to make a 25% deduction from his own monthly salary.

Lang&#x27;s Government soon introduced legislation to cope with the economic problems the state was facing. Its first move was the Reduction of Interest Bill, which was intended to default on payments of overseas debts to British bondholders in an attempt to negotiate the interest rate. The Legislative Council prevented passage on 26 March 1931 by resolving that the bill be read again in six months time. Lang again asked for additional members to force his legislation through. Game, aware of the weight of opinion in the MacDonald Government in London, the Scullin government in Canberra, and Sydney against the Lang administration&#x27;s financial policies, refused. On 28 March the Federal Labor Party expelled the New South Wales Labor Party for its opposition to the financial policy of the Federal government. Despite various petitions and demands that he dismiss Lang, Game declined to act. Game later informed the Dominions Secretary, James Henry Thomas, on 29 March 1931 that he was not convinced that Lang would lose an election at this time.

In March and June 1931 Lang repeatedly requested the necessary 80 appointments to swamp the council and prevent obstruction to his legislation. Game again refused, offering 21 appointments, which were enough to pass some of the legislation but not the most controversial bills, including the bill to default on debts. Finally, in a compromise move with Lang, on 19 November 1931 Game assented to 25 appointments, reasoning that it would not be possible to refuse Lang&#x27;s requests until the Privy Council case was resolved. His telegram to the Dominions Secretary the next day explained further: &quot;I foresee if I refuse now I shall most probably be placed in position before long where...I should not be able to stop at twenty five but should have sooner or later to give sufficient appointments to carry rejected legislation. Such numbers might give Government a permanent majority to carry any and every extreme measure, and extreme factions would probably gain ascendancy owing to what they would represent as my obstinate partiality. Should I refuse appointments until appeal case is heard and should it result in abolition extremists would be in an even stronger position. After reviewing all arguments and considering possibilities I have reached conclusion that my proper and wiser course is to accept advice and have done so.&quot;

During this Game questioned the result if Lang won the appeal to the Privy Council and the Legislative Council was abolished. Various correspondence between him and London confirms that had Lang succeeded, Game may have refused assent to the abolition bills, thereby making it the first time it had been withheld since 1708. This potential situation disappeared, however, with the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 31 May 1932. The judgment dismissed the appeal by the Government of New South Wales. The bills repealing Section 7A and abolishing the Legislative Council could not therefore be presented to the Governor for assent until they had been passed in a referendum. Faced with other problems, Lang&#x27;s plans for abolition ultimately failed. His successor as Premier, Bertram Stevens, later passed major reforms to replace the appointed Legislative Council, by a Council elected by the whole parliament to terms equivalent to four Assembly terms. This was passed by referendum in 1933.

===Harbour Bridge opening===
In March 1932, in anticipation of the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, when Lang decided that he would cut the ribbon and incurred the displeasure of the King, Game reassured the King that Lang had the right to cut the ribbon. Game and his family found much amusement in the controversy thrown up over the matter and the question of whether Game, as governor, should have a 17-gun salute. The far-right New Guard were nevertheless enraged over Lang&#x27;s decision, culminating in Francis de Groot&#x27;s cutting of the ribbon just before the scheduled official opening on 19 March 1932. The ribbon was hastily reattached and Lang opened the bridge with Game looking on, and he later gave a speech commemorating the occasion.

===Dismissal===
When the United Australia Party Government of Joseph Lyons came to power in January 1932, it passed the &quot;Financial Agreement Enforcement Act&quot;, thereby forcing the NSW government to adhere to its debt commitments and to cut government spending.
Lang appealed the decision to the High Court. When the court ruled that the law was valid, Lang ordered Treasury officials to withdraw all the state&#x27;s funds from government bank accounts so that the federal government could not gain access to the money. Game advised Lang that in his view this action was illegal, and that if Lang did not reverse it he would dismiss the government. Lang stood firm, and issued a leaflet in defiance of Game. Game then reluctantly decided to exercise his reserve powers and called Lang to Government House to dismiss him. However, Lang was not the first to hear of his dismissal. The pianist Isador Goodman, who had been befriended by Sir Philip and Lady Game, was at Government House for dinner that night. There were a number of interruptions, and Goodman asked if he perhaps ought to leave. Game replied, &quot;No, that&#x27;s not necessary. You see, I am about to dismiss the Premier.&quot;

On 13 May 1932 Game dismissed Lang&#x27;s government and appointed the UAP leader, Bertram Stevens, as Premier. Stevens formed a coalition with Michael Bruxner&#x27;s Country Party and immediately called an election, at which Lang&#x27;s NSW Labor Party was heavily defeated. This was the first case of an Australian government with the confidence of the lower house of Parliament being dismissed by a vice-regal representative, the second case being when Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam&#x27;s government on 11 November 1975. Game himself felt his decision was the right one, despite his personal liking of Lang. He wrote to his mother-in-law on 2 July 1932: &quot;Still with all his faults of omission and commission I had and still have a personal liking for Lang and a great deal of sympathy for his ideals and I did not at all relish being forced to dismiss him. But I felt faced with the alternative of doing so or reducing the job of Governor all over the Empire to a farce.&quot; Lang himself, despite objecting to his dismissal, conceded that he too liked Game, regarding him as fair and polite, and having had good relations with him.

===End of term===
During his governorship Game was the patron of several organisations including the District and Bush Nursing Associations and the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, and was Chief Scout of the NSW Boy Scouts Association. Lady Game was President of the District and Bush Nursing Associations and the Girl Guides Association. The rest of his term was fairly uneventful, and he returned to Britain following the expiration of his term on 15 January 1935. Before he left Sydney he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG), on the recommendation of Premier Stevens, for his service as governor. In honour of their service to the state, Ku-ring-gai Municipal Council named a major road in Lindfield as Lady Game Drive and a nearby park as Sir Phillip Game Reserve. In memory of Game&#x27;s time as governor, a portrait was commissioned by public subscription and painted by R.G. Eves. It was then displayed at the National Art Gallery of New South Wales before being presented to Government House.

==Metropolitan Police Commissioner==

Upon his return to Britain, Game served as Metropolitan Police Commissioner from November 1935 until 1945, the last senior armed forces officer to be appointed to that post (with the exception of his immediate successor, a senior civil servant, all successive commissioners have been career police officers). Not long after his appointment Game was responsible for policing the funeral of King George V and the 1937 Coronation of George VI and Elizabeth. For his work in the 1937 coronation, Game was appointed by King George VI a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 11 May 1937. His time in the post also saw the experimental introduction of patrol dogs at Peckham in 1938.

Serving as Commissioner during very tumultuous times, Game had to deal with Fascist and Communist demonstrations, a bombing campaign waged by the Irish Republican Army and, during the Second World War, the organisation of the police role in air-raid precautions and relief. He dealt effectively with those problems and the consequent improvement in police morale was an important factor in the survival of London during the concentrated German air attack of 1940–41. In 1943, in an attempt to prevent burglaries, Game urged householders not to keep furs, adapting a verse from Chapter 9 of Ecclesiastes saying, &quot;they are no doubt warmer, and look nicer than a tweed coat, but a live dog is better than a dead lion.&quot;

Towards the end of his time as Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Game worked to establish a boys&#x27; club. The Sir Philip Game Boys&#x27; Club, situated in Croydon, was opened in 1946. The club was officially opened on 19 July 1947 in Game&#x27;s presence by the then Home Secretary, James Chuter Ede. On 2 May 1945 Game was appointed a Knight Grand Cross (GCB) in the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath (he was already a Knight Commander in the Military Division of the same Order); and he retired soon after on 1 June 1945.

He died at his home, Blakenhall, Sevenoaks, Kent, on 4 February 1961, survived by his wife, daughter and by his elder son, who had married Vera Blackburn, daughter of Sir Charles Blackburn. His second son had been killed in action at Taranto, Italy, in 1943. His daughter Rosemary recalled her childhood and her father&#x27;s work in her 1989 memoir, &quot;Growing Up at Government House&quot;. New premises for the Boys&#x27; Club named after him were completed in 1964 and officially opened on 8 May 1966 by the then Home Secretary, Sir Frank Soskice, in the presence of Game&#x27;s widow, who unveiled a plaque in memory of her husband.

<text>Frederick Oakeley (5 September 1802 – 30 January 1880) was an English Roman Catholic convert, priest, and author. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1828 and in 1845 converted to the Church of Rome, becoming Canon of the Westminster Diocese in 1852. 
He is best known for his translation of the Christmas carol &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; (&quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;) from Latin into English.

==Early life==
The youngest child of Sir Charles Oakeley, 1st Baronet, he was born on 5 September 1802 at the Abbey House, Shrewsbury. In 1810 his family moved to the bishop&#x27;s palace at Lichfield. Poor health prevented his leaving home for school, but in his fifteenth year he was sent to Charles Sumner for tuition. In June 1820 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford; he gained a second class in &quot;Literae humaniores&quot; in 1824. After graduating B.A. he won the Chancellor&#x27;s Latin and English prize essays in 1825 and 1827 respectively, and the Ellerton theological prize, also in 1827.

In 1827 he was ordained, and was elected to a chaplain fellowship at Balliol College. In 1830 he became tutor and catechetical lecturer at Balliol, and a prebendary of Lichfield on Bishop Henry Ryder&#x27;s appointment. In 1831 he was select preacher, and in 1835 one of the public examiners to the university. The Bishop of London, Charles Blomfield; appointed him Whitehall preacher in 1837, when he resigned his tutorship at Balliol, but he retained his fellowship.

==Tractarian==
During his residence at Balliol as chaplain-fellow (from 1827) Oakeley became connected with the tractarian movement. Partly under the influence of William George Ward, he had grown dissatisfied with evangelicalism, and in the preface to his first volume of &quot;Whitehall Sermons&quot; (1837) he avowed himself a member of the new Oxford school. In 1839 he became incumbent of Margaret Chapel, the predecessor of All Saints, Margaret Street, and Oxford ceased to be his home.

During the six years that Oakeley passed as minister of Margaret Chapel (1839–45), he became, according to a friend&#x27;s description, the &quot;introducer of that form of worship which is now called ritualism&quot;. He was supported by prominent men, among the friends of Margaret Chapel being Mr. Serjeant Bellasis, Mr Beresford Hope, and William Gladstone. According to an account by Mr. Wakeling the innovations of Oakeley&#x27;s time were limited to the proper furnishing of the altar, a good standard of preaching but little more in the way of ritual. 

The year 1845 was a turning-point in Oakeley&#x27;s life. As a fellow of Balliol he had joined in the election to a fellowship there of his lifelong friend and former pupil Archibald Campbell Tait, the future primate; but Tait had signed, with three others, the first protest against &quot;Tract XC&quot;. The furore over this last Tract led Oakeley, like Ward, to despair of his church and university; and in two pamphlets, published separately at the time both in London and Oxford, he asserted that he held, &quot;as distinct from teaching, all Roman doctrine&quot;. For this avowal he was cited before the court of arches by the Bishop of London. His license was withdrawn, and he was suspended from all clerical duty in the province of Canterbury until he had &quot;retracted his errors&quot; (July 1845).

==Catholic==
In September 1845 Oakeley joined John Henry Newman&#x27;s community at Littlemore in Oxford, and on 29 October was received into the Roman communion in the little chapel in St Clement&#x27;s, Oxford, over Magdalen Bridge. On 31 October he was confirmed at Birmingham by Nicholas Wiseman. From January 1846 to August 1848 he was a theological student in the seminary of the London district, St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware. In the summer of 1848 he joined the staff of the newly-built St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark; on 22 January 1850 he took charge of St John&#x27;s, Islington; in 1852, on the establishment of the new hierarchy under Wiseman as cardinal-archbishop, he was created a canon of the Westminster diocese, and held this office for nearly thirty years, till his death at the end of January 1880, aged 77.

==Works==
Oakeley published 42 works. Before his conversion were:
* &quot;Whitehall Chapel Sermons&quot; (1837)
*&quot;Laudes Diurnæ; the Psalter and Canticles in the Morning and Evening Services, set and pointed to the Gregorian Tones by Richard Redhead&quot;, with a preface by Oakeley on antiphonal chanting, 1843

Also a number of articles contributed to the &quot;British Critic&quot;.

After his conversion he brought out many books in support of Catholicism, including:
* &quot;The Ceremonies of the Mass&quot; (1855) a standard work at Rome, where it was translated into Italian by Lorenzo Santarelli, and published by authority;
* &quot;The Church of the Bible&quot; (1857)
* &quot;The Order and Ceremonial of the Most Holy and Adorable Sacrifice of the Mass: Explained in a Dialogue Between a Priest and a Catechumen&quot; (1859)
* &quot;Lyra Liturgica&quot; (1865) 
* &quot;Historical Notes on the Tractarian Movement&quot; (1865)
* &quot;The Priest to the Mission&quot; (1871)
* &quot;Catholic Worship: A Manual of Popular Instruction on the Ceremonies and Devotions of the Church&quot; (1872)
* &quot;The Voice of Creation&quot; (1876)

He was a constant contributor to the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; and &quot;The Month&quot;. To Cardinal Manning&#x27;s &quot;Essays on Religious Subjects&quot; (1865) he contributed &quot;The Position of a Catholic Minority in a non-Catholic Country&quot;. The last article he wrote was one in &quot;Time&quot; (March 1880), on &quot;Personal Recollections of Oxford from 1820 to 1845&quot; (reprinted in Lilian M. Quiller-Couch&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscences of Oxford&quot;, 1892, Oxf. Hist. Soc.) His &quot;Youthful Martyrs of Rome&quot;, a verse drama in five acts (1856), was adapted from Cardinal Wiseman&#x27;s &quot;Fabiola&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Barb&quot; (SSN-596), a &quot;Permit&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the barb, a kingfish of the Atlantic coast.

The contract to build her was awarded to the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and her keel was laid down on 9 November 1959. She was launched on 12 February 1962 sponsored by Mrs. Marjorie Fluckey, wife of Rear Admiral Eugene Bennett Fluckey, who earned the Medal of Honor as Commanding Officer of . The new &quot;Barb&quot; was commissioned on 24 August 1963.

==Service history==

===1963–1967===
&quot;Barb&quot; departed Pascagoula, Mississippi on 28 September for her shakedown cruise off the west coast. Sailing by way of the Panama Canal and Vallejo, California, she arrived in Puget Sound where she carried out a variety of trials between 30 October and 19 November. The submarine then concluded her shakedown training with a four-week, round-trip voyage to Hawaii. Upon her return to the United States West Coast on 17 December 1963, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for post-shakedown availability. Those repairs and modifications occupied her for nine months, carrying her well into 1964. On 1 July 1964, her home port was officially changed from Vallejo, California, to Pearl Harbor. Seven weeks later, &quot;Barb&quot; left the yard at Mare Island and began a somewhat circuitous voyage to her new base, traveling by way of Seattle, Washington.

In Hawaii, as part of Submarine Division 71, the boat pursued an active schedule of training missions in the local operating area. On 1 December 1964, &quot;Barb&quot; was designated flagship for the Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. Local training operations in the Hawaiian Islands took up most of 1965. In fact, save for the period between 9 June and 25 July 1965 during which she voyaged to Mare Island Naval Shipyard for repairs to her sonar, the submarine operated in the Hawaiian area exclusively for two years. In the spring of 1966, Barb completed an advanced training exercise from 3 March to 15 May. In late 1966, the submarine made another extended voyage to the U.S. West Coast during which she visited San Francisco and then carried out weapons alignment tests at Dabob Bay, Washington, before undergoing repairs and modifications at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. &quot;Barb&quot; returned to Hawaii late in October and spent the rest of 1966 in Pearl Harbor in a restricted availability.

===1967–1969===
&quot;Barb&quot; resumed a normal training schedule in the Hawaiian operating area through the first four months of 1967. Soon thereafter, however, her routine underwent a significant change when she embarked on her first deployment to the Far East on 9 May. She arrived at Naha, Okinawa, on 22 May, and sailed for Vietnamese waters on the 27th for a Vietnam War tour of duty with Task Group 77.9. After that assignment, &quot;Barb&quot; made a liberty call at Singapore before heading for Yokosuka on 19 June. The submarine spent nine days at Yokosuka and then returned to sea for almost three weeks of unspecified operations. Another upkeep period back at Yokosuka closed out the month of August, at which point &quot;Barb&quot; got underway for Hong Kong and a week-long liberty and goodwill visit. While on her way back to the Vietnamese war zone, she received orders diverting her to training duty at Naha, Okinawa. That employment lasted until the second week in October, at which time she headed for Guam. Though diverted briefly to Subic Bay, &quot;Barb&quot; reached her destination on 15 October. At the conclusion of some tactical exercises and upkeep at Guam, she set out on the voyage back to Hawaii on 24 October. The submarine ended her first Far Eastern deployment when she reentered Pearl Harbor on 1 November.

Following post-deployment standdown, &quot;Barb&quot; resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands at the beginning of 1968. On 11 April 1968 &quot;Barb&quot; reported dozens of warships, including four or five submarines, of the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet all moving slowly and pinging with active sonar. The was missing, and a series of events that would prompt the building of the Hughes Glomar Explorer six years later had begun.

In late May 1968 she commenced regular overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. The maintenance and repairs took up the rest of 1968 and nearly all of 1969. The overhaul ended officially on 8 December 1969, just in time for the annual holiday standdown.

===1970–1972===
Early in January 1970, &quot;Barb&quot; sailed to Washington state again to carry out weapons systems&#x27; accuracy tests and to test a new type of torpedo. Returning to Hawaii late in February, &quot;Barb&quot; pursued a normal schedule of local training missions from her base at Pearl Harbor. That occupied her for the remainder of 1970; though, late in the year, she began preparations to deploy overseas.

The submarine left Pearl Harbor for the Western Pacific on 2 January 1971. She combined an extended special operation with her passage west that made the transit an unusually long one. She did not arrive in Yokosuka until 7 February. After two weeks of upkeep there, she headed for Subic Bay where she made a two-day stop. Departing Subic Bay on the 28th, &quot;Barb&quot; carried out another four weeks of special operations before returning to Subic Bay on 28 March. On the 30th, she embarked on the voyage to Hong Kong where she spent the first week in April. From Hong Kong, the warship sailed to the Mariana Islands, arriving at Guam on the 15th and remaining there for the rest of the month. On 1 May, she returned to sea for eight weeks of special operations. Her deployment ended on 25 June with her arrival back in Pearl Harbor.

After post-deployment standdown, &quot;Barb&quot; began an extended shipyard availability at the end of July. She left the drydock in mid-October, but other repair work occupied her through the end of 1971 and into 1972 so &quot;Barb&quot; did not resume normal operations until the spring of 1972.

===1972–1976===
On 22 May 1972, the submarine deployed to the Marianas area once more and operated from Apra Harbor, Guam, for most of the remainder of the year.

On 8 July 1972, &quot;Barb&quot; lay in Apra Harbor completing repairs prior to a patrol in the Mariana Islands. Typhoon Rita was approaching Guam, and &quot;Barb&quot; intended to be at sea and submerged before the storm arrived. Shortly after 04:00 hours, &quot;Cobalt 2&quot;, a B-52 Stratofortress of the Strategic Air Command commanded by United States Air Force Captain Leroy Johnson, took off from Andersen Air Force Base, intending to fly over the storm. Soon after takeoff, however, the aircraft became uncontrollable, and the crew bailed out. By 05:25, the six-man crew were in the ocean. A C-97 Stratofreighter spotted the survivors and radioed their location to Joint Search and Rescue at Agana. &quot;Barb&quot; and submarine were ordered to proceed at best speed to provide rescue. At about 23:00, &quot;Barb&quot; surfaced about from the reported location. The heavy weather had already forced surface ships to turn back, and caused the round-hulled submarine to roll and corkscrew violently. It was 01:15 hours the next morning before the boat&#x27;s crew spotted the survivors&#x27; lights. They made numerous attempts to rescue the airmen through the night, but did not succeed.

By 07:40 hours, visibility had improved and the typhoon had moved from the immediate area, and the boat approached a group of three rafts. Several attempts to shoot a line to the survivors failed, so Chief Torpedoman Jon Hentz volunteered to swim to them, towing a line. At about 08:15, the rafts holding Major Ronald Dvorak, the Electronic Warfare Officer, Lieutenant William Neely III, the copilot, and Lieutenant Kent Dodson, the navigator, were secured to the submarine. Over the next hour, they were brought aboard, a task made more challenging by the waves that often exposed the submarine&#x27;s screw and the ballast tank flood grates at the bottom of the boat. At about 10:00 hours, orbiting aircraft vectored &quot;Barb&quot; to the next survivor, Airman Daniel Johansen, the aircraft&#x27;s gunner, who caught a line shot to him and was pulled aboard in less than a quarter-hour.

Meanwhile, &quot;Gurnard&quot; arrived on the scene, found Captain Leroy Johnson, the aircraft commander, and brought him aboard. Lieutenant Colonel J.L. Vaughn, the radar navigator, had not survived the night. Aircraft sighted his body floating face down, still tied to his raft.

The survivors were carried back to Guam, where each boat was presented the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and ten submariners who played perilous topside roles received individual commendations. Torpedoman Hentz received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.

On 15 December 1972, &quot;Barb&quot; returned to Hawaii. From January to early March 1973, she carried out normal training missions out of her home port. On 10 March, she stood out of Pearl Harbor on a three-month overseas assignment. Following another eight-week special operation, she visited Pusan, South Korea, for four days during the second week in May. From Pusan, the submarine sailed back to the Marianas, in the vicinity of which she operated for about a month before heading back to Hawaii on 10 June. She reentered Pearl Harbor on the 18th.

At the end of the usual month of leave and upkeep, &quot;Barb&quot; took up local training operations once again in July. In September, she participated in the multinational exercise RIMPAC 73. During the remainder of 1973, the submarine returned to local training duty and began preparations for her second refueling overhaul scheduled to begin the following spring. That overhaul commenced when she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 1 March 1974, and lasted for just over 20 months. During that time, her home port was changed from Pearl Harbor to San Diego so that, when she completed the overhaul early in November 1975, &quot;Barb&quot; began her refresher training out of that new home port. Similar assignments carried out all along the west coast of North America occupied her time for almost 16 months. She did not start preparing for another tour of duty overseas until late in 1976, and the deployment itself did not begin until early in 1977.

===1977–1979===
On 17 February 1977, &quot;Barb&quot; stood out of San Diego on her way to the Far East. On the first leg of her voyage, she participated in the multinational exercise RIMPAC 77 and then made a two-day call at her former home port, Pearl Harbor, at the end of the month. She then embarked on the transit to Subic Bay, the duration of which was extended by exercises with TG 37.9 and TG 77.3. The submarine arrived in Subic Bay on 18 March but returned to sea almost immediately for the passage to Chinhae, Korea. Along the way, she took part in exercises with units of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and with elements of the South Korean Navy. &quot;Barb&quot; visited Chinhae from 29 March to 1 April and then called at Hong Kong between 11 and 14 April. From Hong Kong, she set out for the Marianas, exercising with units of the Royal New Zealand Air Force and United States Navy patrol aircraft along the way. The submarine spent the period 20 April to 9 May in port at Guam, then put to sea for the first of two special operations that she conducted in May and June. &quot;Barb&quot; reentered Guam on 24 May, but returned to sea the following day to begin the second and longer of her two special operations. That employment lasted until the end of June at which time she put into Subic Bay for a week of liberty before heading back to the United States on 7 July.

On the way home, &quot;Barb&quot; called at Hawaii for several days in the latter part of July, resuming the voyage home on the 25th. She arrived back in San Diego on 2 August. After several weeks of relative inactivity, the submarine embarked on a schedule of local operations highlighted by her selection as a test platform for the Tomahawk cruise missile in late October. She remained so occupied through the end of 1977 into the second quarter of 1978. On 26 April, the warship entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a three-month availability. She resumed normal operations out of San Diego late in July and continued so engaged until deploying to the western Pacific once more on 27 September 1978. &quot;Barb&quot; spent the week between 3 and 10 October in Hawaii and then resumed her passage west arriving in Subic Bay on the 29th. She stayed in Subic Bay for three weeks and then set sail for Japan on 20 November. After four days of voyage repairs at Yokosuka, she returned to sea on 1 December for a month-long special operation that she concluded at Chinhae, Korea, on the last day of 1978.

The Chinhae visit extended three days into 1979 at which point the submarine set out for the Marianas. She reached Guam on 11 January and remained there through the end of the month. On 1 February, she embarked on the voyage to Subic Bay where she arrived on the 6th. Three days later, &quot;Barb&quot; put to sea to take part in MULTIPLEX 2-79 that lasted until the 21st. She returned to Subic Bay for the last week in February before setting out on the voyage home on the 28th. Almost three weeks later, on 17 March, &quot;Barb&quot; stood into San Diego and commenced seven weeks of post-deployment leave and upkeep. At the end of the first week in May, she embarked upon a normal training routine that she carried out in the southern California operating area. Similar evolutions occupied her for the rest of 1979 and into the first weeks of 1980.

===1980–1989===
On 7 February 1980, &quot;Barb&quot; deployed to the mid-Pacific region to conduct equipment tests and procedure evaluations and to take part in the multinational exercise, RIMPAC 80. Based at Pearl Harbor, she carried out those missions until early April when she returned to San Diego. Another seven-week upkeep period followed, after which she resumed local operations out of San Diego. The submarine continued to pursue training assignments locally until July. On 21 July, &quot;Barb&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an unusually extensive overhaul, which lasted until late 1982. The propulsion plant underwent steam generator cleaning. The fire control and sonar systems were replaced with the latest AN/BQQ-5 sonar and digital fire control technology. &quot;Barb&quot; received the complete SUBSAFE package of modifications the Navy first began installing on submarines in the 1960s. What was to have been an 18-month overhaul stretched into 27 months due to shipyard repair quality problems and scheduling delays. &quot;Barb&quot; underwent not one but four sea trials as each trial identified additional re-work to be done at the shipyard. &quot;Barb&quot; eventually returned to the Point Loma submarine base in San Diego, California in December 1982. Additional re-work was done in floating dry-dock in San Diego in early 1983.

&quot;Barb&quot; was deactivated on 10 March 1989, then decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 December 1989. Ex-&quot;Barb&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, and on 14 March 1996 ceased to exist.

Some of her credits include playing Julie Rogers in the final season of the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1980–1981), Stacey Sutton in the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), Kiri in &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982), Sheena in &quot;Sheena: Queen of the Jungle&quot; (1984), and Midge Pinciotti on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2004).

==Early life==
Tanya Roberts was born Victoria Leigh Blum in 1949 (although long given as 1955) in Manhattan, New York City, to Oscar Blum and his wife Dorothy (née Smith). Oscar Maximilian Blum was born in New York City. Oscar&#x27;s father, Theodor Blum, did pioneering work in local anesthesia and the use of x-rays in dental care. Theodor was born in Vienna, Austria and immigrated to New York in 1904. Oscar earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cornell University in 1934 and was a first year student in the medical college there. In 1940, Tanya&#x27;s father was working as an assistant manager for a music publishing house in New York City. He married in 1945 in Weymouth, England, to Dorothy Leigh Smith from Oldham, England. At age 22 Dorothy arrived in New York City in April 1945. In 1948, Dorothy returned to New York from a trip to England with Tanya&#x27;s two-year-old sister, Barbara. Tanya&#x27;s father was of Jewish descent and her mother was of English or Irish descent. It has also been reported that her father was of Irish descent and her mother was Jewish. She had one older sister, Barbara. The 1950 U.S. Census shows that, as of April 1950, the Blum family lived in the hamlet of Hewlett in Hempstead, NY and that Oscar Blum was a sales executive for a pen manufacturer. The Blum family were living in Scarsdale, New York in July 1950, purchasing the property in March 1951, and selling it January 1958. Later in the same month in 1958 Tanya&#x27;s parents obtained a mortgage to buy a property in neighboring Greenburgh, New York and later sold it in July 1961.

After meeting psychology student Barry Roberts while waiting in line for a movie, Victoria Blum proposed to him in a subway station and they were soon married in 1973. While Barry pursued a career as a screenwriter, she began to study at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Uta Hagen under the name Tanya Roberts.

==Career==
===1970s: Early career and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;===
Roberts began her career as a model in TV ads for Excedrin, Ultra Brite, Clairol, and Cool Ray sunglasses. She played serious roles in the off-Broadway productions &quot;Picnic&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot;. She also supported herself as an Arthur Murray dance instructor. Her film debut was in &quot;The Last Victim&quot; (1975). This was followed by the comedy &quot;The Yum-Yum Girls&quot; (1976). In 1977, as Barry Roberts was securing his own screenwriting career, the couple moved to Hollywood. Roberts was then cast in &quot;The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; (1977) and the following year, participated in the drama &quot;Fingers&quot;. In 1979 Roberts appeared in the cult film &quot;Tourist Trap&quot;, &quot;Racquet,&quot; and &quot;California Dreaming&quot;. Roberts was featured in several television pilots which were not picked up: &quot;Zuma Beach&quot; (a 1978 comedy), &quot;Pleasure Cove&quot; (1979), and &quot;Waikiki&quot; (1980).

In the summer of 1980, Roberts was chosen from some 2,000 candidates to replace Shelley Hack in the fifth season of the detective television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Roberts played Julie Rogers, a streetwise fighter who used her fists more than her gun. Producers hoped Roberts&#x27;s presence would revitalize the series&#x27;s declining ratings and regenerate media interest in the series. Before the season&#x27;s premiere, Roberts was featured on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine with a headline asking if Roberts would be able to save the declining series from cancellation. Despite the hype of Roberts&#x27;s debut in November 1980, the series continued to draw dismal ratings and was canceled in June 1981.

===1982–1984: B-movies===

Roberts played Kiri, a slave rescued by protagonist Dar (Marc Singer) in the adventure fantasy film &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982), which became a cult film. She was featured in a nude pictorial in &quot;Playboy&quot; to help promote the film, appearing on the cover of the October 1982 issue. In 1983, Roberts filmed the Italian-made adventure fantasy film &quot;Hearts and Armour&quot; (also known as &quot;Paladini-storia d&#x27;armi e d&#x27;amori&quot; and &quot;Paladins — The Story of Love and Arms&quot;), based on the medieval novel &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

She portrayed Velda, the secretary to private detective Mike Hammer, in the television film &quot;Murder Me, Murder You&quot; (1983), based on crime novelist Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer private detective series. The two-part pilot spawned the syndicated television series &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot;. She declined to continue the role in the Mike Hammer series to work on her next project, the 1984 fantasy film &quot;Sheena: Queen of the Jungle,&quot; in which she played the main character. The film was a box-office failure, and garnered her a nomination for &quot;Worst Actress&quot; at the Razzie Awards. Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, film critic Pauline Kael described Roberts as &quot;[having] a staring, comic-book opaqueness&quot; and &quot;a walking, talking icon&quot;.

===1985–2005: &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;===

Roberts appeared as Bond girl, geologist Stacey Sutton, in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985) with Roger Moore; the first choice for the role was Priscilla Presley. In the wake of this performance, Roberts was nominated for a second Razzie Award. Roberts&#x27;s other 1980s films include &quot;Night Eyes&quot;, an erotic thriller; &quot;Body Slam&quot; (1987), an action film set in the professional wrestling world (another cult favorite); and &quot;Purgatory&quot;, a film about a woman wrongfully imprisoned in Africa. Towards the end of the decade, Roberts recorded the reference footage of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; used by producers during the creation of the animated adaptation.

Roberts starred in the erotic thriller &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; (1991) alongside Margaux Hemingway. In 1992, she played Kay Egan in &quot;Sins of Desire&quot;. She appeared on the cable series &quot;Hot Line&quot; in 1995, and in the video game &quot;The Pandora Directive&quot; in 1996.

In 1998, Roberts took the role of Midge Pinciotti on the television sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. In her obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ryan Gilbey praises &quot;[h]er knowing performance&quot; in this role, &quot;slow on the uptake but growing dissatisfied with her life as a housewife&quot;. She left the series after the 3rd season in 2001, because her husband had become terminally ill, returning for a few special guest appearances in the 6th and 7th seasons in 2004.

==Personal life==
Roberts was married to Barry Roberts from 1973 until his death in 2006. They had no children. Roberts lived in Hollywood Hills, California. Some time after his death, she became the partner of Lance O&#x27;Brien. Her sister, Barbara Chase, was married to Timothy Leary.

Roberts wrote the foreword to the book &quot;The Q Guide to Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2008). She was described by her publicist as an animal rights activist. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she maintained an active social media presence by hosting video chats on Facebook and Zoom.

==Death==
While hiking on December 23, 2020, Roberts developed lower intestinal pain and difficulty breathing. She returned home to rest. Early the next morning, she fell out of bed and found she could not get up. She was taken to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where it was determined she had developed a urinary tract infection that had advanced to sepsis. Her body&#x27;s immune response to the infection resulted in multi-organ failure. She had to be placed on a ventilator to help her breathe. Her boyfriend, Lance O&#x27;Brien, was not allowed to see her due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Her condition deteriorated, and on January 3, 2021, she was taken off life support. O&#x27;Brien was finally then allowed to visit her. Her death was prematurely reported early on January 4, though she died that evening. In a handwritten will, Roberts left her estate to O&#x27;Brien.

Roberts&#x27; death was announced prematurely by her publicist.

<doc id="756495" wikidata="Q7900557" url="?curid=756495" title="Urian Oakes">
<text>Urian Oakes (1631 – July 25, 1681) was an English-born American Congregational minister and educator who served as the fourth president of Harvard College.

==Early life==
The son of Edward and Jane Oakes, he was born in England in 1631 or 1632, and went, when a child, with his father to Massachusetts by the year 1640; Thomas Oakes was his brother. He graduated at Harvard College in 1649. Oakes returned to England during the time of the Commonwealth, and became a minister at Titchfield. He married, probably in England, to an unknown wife. He was one of many clergymen ejected from their living in 1662 as a result of the Act of Uniformity.
Oakes found work as a schoolteacher and nonconformist minister.

==Connection with Harvard==
Oakes&#x27; wife died in 1669. Two years later a deputation, sent to England to find a minister for the vacant church of Cambridge, Massachusetts, chose Oakes. He took up the post in November 1671, and soon after he became one of the governors of Harvard College. Leonard Hoar became President of Harvard in 1672, but was disliked by many, including some of the governors, among them Oakes. He and other of his colleagues resigned, and, in spite of the efforts of the general court of overseers, would not withdraw their resignation till Hoar himself vacated the presidency on 15 March 1675. The vacancy created was filled by the appointment of Oakes. He, however, would only accept it provisionally; but after discharging the duties of the office for four years, he in 1679 accepted the full appointment in form, and held it till his death in Cambridge on July 25, 1681. Calamy states that Oakes was noted for &#x27;the uncommon sweetness of his temper,&#x27; and in New England he was greatly beloved by his congregation and popular with all who came in contact with him.

==Legacy==
He was known as a preacher and Latinist. His extant writings are three sermons—two preached at the annual election of the artillery company in 1672 and 1676, and the third at the election of representatives in 1673—and a monody in English verse (Cambridge, 1677) on the death of Thomas Shepard, minister of the church in Charlestown.

<text>USS &quot;Flasher&quot; (SSN-613), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the flasher, a member of the fish family Lobotidae, which have an unusual placement of the second dorsal and anal fins, posteriorly located on the body, close to the tail.

==Construction history==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 9 June 1960 and her keel was laid down on 14 April 1961.

Originally laid down as the eleventh submarine in the &quot;Thresher&quot;-class building program, &quot;Flasher&quot; was extensively modified during the construction period. These modifications consisted of lengthening the hull, lengthening the sail, and upgrading the watertight integrity of the sea water systems. The SUBSAFE Program was developed as a result of the loss of , the first submarine of the class; &quot;Flasher&quot; became the first submarine certified as SUBSAFE. This contributed to the lengthy delay between being laid down and commissioning.

In the nation&#x27;s only simultaneous twin launching of Nuclear submarines, &quot;Flasher&quot; and were launched on 22 June 1963. &quot;Flasher&quot; was sponsored and christened by Mrs. Paul F. Fay, Jr., wife of the Under Secretary of the Navy. Vice Admiral Elton W. Grenfell, then Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (ComSubLant), delivered the principal address. She was commissioned on 22 July 1966, with Commander Kenneth M. Carr in command. The principal speaker at the commissioning was US Representative George W. Grider of Tennessee, who had commanded during World War II and presented Cdr Carr with the original WW II Flasher Battle Flag that was later mounted and hung in the crewsmess.

==Service history==

===1966–1969===
After commissioning, &quot;Flasher&quot; arrived at new her home port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 September 1966, under command of CDR Kenneth M. Carr. On 7 October 1966 she received a visit from the Director General of the Japanese Defense Agency Mr. Elkichi Kambayashiyama, in company with COMSUBPAC Rear Admiral John H. Maurer.

In late January 1968 Flasher deployed with the fleet assembled after the USS Pueblo was captured by the North Koreans. Her station was in the Sea of Japan off the harbor of Wonsan, NK. While patrolling she encountered a small ice flow that snapped off the top of a periscope. Flasher proceeded to Guam for 9 days to have the periscope replaced and then proceeded back to her station off North Korea. After leaving station Flasher obtained permission to have a port call at Yokosuka, Japan before sailing for her home port of Pearl harbor Hawaii. For this deployment Flasher was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Korean Defense Service Medal.

&quot;Flasher&quot; sailed for her first Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment on 25 April 1969, and was awarded her first Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for overall combat excellence on 4 July 1968. &quot;Flasher&quot; was awarded her second consecutive Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; on 1 July 1969.

Presidential Unit Citation – 1970
For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty as a member of the Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, during the spring of 1970. USS FLASHER successfully accomplished an extremely difficult, demanding, and most sensitive operation of exceptional value and lasting significance to the readiness posture of the United States. The outstanding courage, resourcefulness, professional competence and inspiring devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of USS FLASHER reflected great credit upon themselves and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

== Ship insignia ==
The insignia of the &quot;Flasher&quot; was adapted from the insignia of the original , commissioned on 25 September 1943. Popular lore was that this insignia was designed by Walt Disney. However, other sources indicate that the logo was designed by a graphic artist who also worked for Disney, and that at best Walt Disney merely looked over his shoulder and provided some suggestions. During the final days of construction on the SSN-613, the crew developed several designs based on the original. The two ships&#x27; numbers were added and the electron orbits added to symbolize nuclear power. The insignia became official in 1965.

<text>The KDE Advanced Text Editor, or Kate, is a source code editor developed by the KDE free software community. It has been a part of KDE Software Compilation since version 2.2, which was first released in 2001. Intended for software developers, it features syntax highlighting, code folding, customizable layouts, multiple cursors and selections, regular expression support, and extensibility via plugins. The text editor&#x27;s mascot is Kate the Cyber Woodpecker.

==History==

Kate has been part of the KDE Software Compilation since release 2.2 in 2001. Because of KParts technology, it is possible to embed Kate as an editing component in other KDE applications. Major KDE applications which use Kate as an editing component include the integrated development environment KDevelop, the web development environment Quanta Plus, and the LaTeX front-end Kile.

Kate has won the advanced text editor comparison in &quot;Linux Voice&quot; magazine.

, development had started to port Kate, along with Dolphin, Konsole, KDE Telepathy, and Yakuake, to KDE Frameworks 5.

In 2022, the KDE text-editor KWrite was modified to use the same code base as Kate with deactivated features.

==Features==
Kate is a source code editor that features syntax highlighting for over 300 file formats with code folding rules. The syntax highlighting is extensible via XML files. It supports UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO-8859-1 and ASCII encoding schemes and can detect a file&#x27;s character encoding automatically. Kate offers code completion and reference finding for various programming languages through its Language Server Protocol Client plugin. The default configuration supports C, C++, D, Fortran, Go, Latex, Python, Rust, and OCaml.

Kate&#x27;s main text editor widget is called &quot;KatePart&quot;, which is reusable under the terms of the LGPL version 2 license. It must not be confused with the KParts, a KDE plugin framework for user interface components that Kate also uses.

Kate can be used as a modal text editor through its &quot;vi&quot; input mode.

Kate features multiple document interface, window splitting, project editing and sessions to facilitate editing multiple documents. Using &quot;sessions&quot;, one can customize Kate for different projects by saving the list of open files, the list of enabled plug-ins and the window configuration. 

Kate includes the KDE terminal emulator Konsole through its Terminal Tool View plugin. Since version 23.04, the terminal is also available on windows.

The &quot;quick open&quot; feature allows searching opened files by name for quick recalling. Line modification indicators highlight lines with unsaved changes and lines added in the current session.

Being a KDE application, Kate transparently opens and saves files over all protocols supported by KIO libraries. This includes HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMB and WebDAV, among others.

, unlike Xed, &quot;Kate&quot; is equipped with a session manager which allows naming, saving, and restoring sessions, meaning a list of momentarily open file tabs. Saved sessions are stored as key-value-formatted codice_1 files into codice_2.

Other features are a clipboard history with up to ten items, the ability to jump to a line number, and source control integration using Git

Francis Christopher Oakley (born 1931) is the former Edward Dorr Griffin Professor of the History of ideas at Williams College, President Emeritus of Williams College and President Emeritus of the American Council of Learned Societies, New York. He also served as Interim Director of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.

== Biography ==
Born in England in 1931 of Irish immigrant parents and raised in Liverpool. He was educated at Oxford University, where he graduated in 1953 with First Class Honours in the Honours School of Modern History. Awarded a Goldsmiths&#x27; Company&#x27;s Commonwealth Traveling Research Scholarship, he spent the next two years studying Latin Palaeography and the history of Medieval Philosophy at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto.

Oakley&#x27;s graduate studies were interrupted by the need to return to England to serve for two years (followed by reserve duty) in the British Army, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals and was attached to the Commonwealth Communications Army Network (COMCAN). Having decided to return to North America, he completed his Ph.D. in History at Yale University in 1959 and spent the next two years teaching in the Yale History Department before taking a position in the history department of Williams College. There, for forty years, he taught medieval and early-modern history, as well as courses in the Interdepartmental History of Ideas major (of which he was co-founder) and in the Environmental Studies Program until his retirement in 2002.

Oakley spent seventeen years of senior administrative service at Williams (1977–94), first as Dean of the Faculty, then as President of the College, and later, 2002–03, as President of the American Council of Learned Societies in New York City—an interim appointment.

Oakley has held visiting research appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the National Humanities Center in North Carolina, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. During the academic year 1999-2000, he held the Sir Isaiah Berlin Visiting Professorship in the History of Ideas at Oxford University.

Oakley has written extensively on topics pertaining to medieval and early modern intellectual and religious history and to American higher education, and is the co-editor of three volumes as well as the author of fifteen books. Prominent among the latter are his &quot;Omnipotence&quot;, &quot;Covenant and Order: An Excursion in the History of Ideas from Abelard to Leibniz&quot;, (1984), &quot;Community of Learning: The American College and the Liberal Arts Tradition&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Conciliarist Tradition: Constitutionalism in the Catholic Church 1300-1870&quot; (2003), which was awarded the Roland H. Bainton Book Prize in 2004. For ten years, Oakley worked on a trilogy with the overall title of &quot;The Emergence of Western Political Thought in the Latin Middle Ages&quot;, published by Yale University Press between 2010 and 2015, and for which he received the 2016 Haskins Medal from the Medieval Academy of America. An honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he is also Fellow of the Medieval Academy of America (President of the Fellows, 1999-2002) and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He holds honorary degrees, LL.D., L.H.D. and Litt.D., from Notre Dame, Northwestern University, Wesleyan University, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Sacred Heart University, Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Southern Methodist University, and Williams College.

The historian has served for many years on the boards of various non-profit organizations in the arts and higher education, among them the Williamstown Theatre Festival, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), the American Council of Learned Societies (board chair 1994-97), the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute (board president 1998-2005), and the National Humanities Center (board chair 2004-7). Oakley currently serves as the Interim Director of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.

He is married to the former Claire-Ann Lamenzo of Manchester, CT, a fiber artist and horsewoman. They have four children—Deirdre, Christopher, Timothy, and Brian—and seven grandchildren; William, Charlotte, Ryann, Erin, Kevin and Joslyn Oakley.

<doc id="756506" wikidata="Q7328152" url="?curid=756506" title="Richard Oastler">
<text>Richard Oastler (20 December 1789 – 22 August 1861) was a &quot;Tory radical&quot;, an active opponent of Catholic Emancipation and Parliamentary Reform and a lifelong admirer of the Duke of Wellington; but also an abolitionist and prominent in the &quot;anti-Poor Law&quot; resistance to the implementation of the &quot;New Poor Law&quot; of 1834. Most notably, as his sobriquet of the &quot;Factory King&quot; indicates, he was at the heart of the campaign for a ten-hour working day in its early years: although less so by the time of its successful culmination in the Factories Act 1847, he retained the sobriquet.

&quot;Moved by pity and indignation at the long hours worked by young children in factories, he devoted his life to their emancipation, and was a tireless champion of the Ten Hours Factory Bill&quot; noted a commemorative plaque erected in Leeds parish church in 1925. &quot;He cannot altogether claim prominence as a political thinker...but history acclaims him not as a politician, but as an agitator&quot; commented the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; on that occasion.

==Early years==
Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, Oastler was the youngest of ten children born to Sarah (a daughter of Joseph Scurr) and Robert Oastler, a linen merchant. Robert continued to live in Leeds when he later became steward for Thomas Thornhill, the absentee landlord of Fixby, a large estate near Huddersfield, and of Calverley (between Leeds and Bradford, to the north of both). When Richard was six, his twelve-year-old brother Robert died as a result of a fire in a flax mill. Richard attended a Moravian boarding school from 1798 to 1806 (&quot;It was there that I learned to be bold, for I was taught there to fear nothing but sin&quot;), and then (his father vetoing Richard&#x27;s desire to become a barrister) started training to become an architect.
After four years his failing sight forced him to give this up; in 1810 he became a commission agent, dealing in oils and dry-saltery: he also acted as a steward for the Dixons of Gledhow Hall near Leeds, and was used by his father from time to time to carry out work for the Fixby estate (as when in 1812 he organised precautions against the Luddites). He became involved in charity work in Leeds; sick visiting with Michael Thomas Sadler and organising charitable relief of the destitute. In 1816, he married Mary Tatham, daughter of Mary (née Strickland, from Leeds) and Thomas Tatham, a Nottingham grocer. Richard and Mary had two children, both of whom had died by 1819. Early in 1820 he went bankrupt; later that year on the death of his father, he was invited to succeed him as steward of the Fixby estate, looking after a rent roll of £18,000 per year, on an annual salary of £300. He accepted, moving to Fixby Hall in 1821. When in 1827 the vicar of Halifax (in which parish Fixby lay) attempted to increase his income by &quot;resuming&quot; collection of various tithes which he claimed to be &quot;customary&quot;, Oastler was prominent in opposition. He later claimed that it was this struggle that had broken his health, leaving him liable to periodic breakdowns in health.

==Political philosophy==
To Oastler &quot;Tory-Radical&quot; was not a description of a political philosophy (and certainly not of his) but of a tactical alliance of the supporters of two different philosophies against the Whigs. He was a &quot;Church and King&quot; Tory but, as the Duke of Wellington noted, a strange one. He denied any element of Radicalism in his political philosophy, and regarded himself as an &quot;ultra-Tory&quot; rather than a Peelite &quot;Conservative&quot;; he thought Peel too readily accepted (and adopted) the Whig application of the modern doctrines of &quot;political economy&quot; to the country&#x27;s problems. He held that God knew better than Malthus: nothing could supersede Biblical injunctions that the poor should not be oppressed and the distressed should be succoured. Market forces were not a &quot;hidden hand&quot; working for some greater good, nor was interference with them imprudent folly. On the contrary I believe that man is a fallen, selfish, ignorant being, and that every unregulated and unrestrained action of his is fraught with evil – that, if left without the restraining and regulating laws of God (which, by our Constitution, must be part and parcel of the laws of the land), instead of preferring such schemes, in the search of his own advantage, as would be advantageous to the society, his selfishness would lead him to injure all for his own benefit. I learn this from the Holy Bible. I have often witnessed it.
 Reform on a Whig laissez-faire agenda had worsened the condition of the poor and led to chronic discontent, to which the response was greater centralisation and greater coercion; this was a vicious circle which could only end badly. He had seen the &quot;poor deluded famished Luddites&quot; and thought them to be pitied rather than feared – only because they were famished had they allowed themselves to be deluded. English working people loved peace, order and their old local habits; they disliked change and confusion The great mistake in the minds of those raised above the working class is, that they think the people want plunder and anarchy. I know they want no such thing – they want peace and rest – and their rights. They want to be able to go out in a morning, get a good day&#x27;s work done, and come home with a fair remuneration... If the working men of England were dealt with according to the Bible rather than &quot;political economy&quot; their economic woes would disappear. With those woes gone support for Reform, Radicalism, trades unionism etc. would evaporate. There would then be no need for a centralised coercive state apparatus: instead the throne (and the rest of the constitution) would rest on the securest foundation – the love of the people. To Oastler, therefore, rich Whigs were a greater danger to the &quot;status quo&quot; than were working-class Radicals. Until the 1840s, very few Tories would have agreed with him: events such as the Bristol riots of 1831 seeming to provide evidence that coercion was essential.
Working class radicals were initially dubious about allying themselves with an opponent of their constitutional aspirations, but eventually came to value Oastler more highly than many of their ostensible allies; a co-belligerent &quot;above purchase and above suspicion&quot; on bread-and-butter issues: the portrait of Oastler reproduced in this article was given away by the Chartist Northern Star in its series of prints of &quot;Portraits of Patriots&quot;.

==Factory Reform==
===&quot;Yorkshire Slavery&quot;===
In 1830 Oastler, a committed abolitionist, was visiting John Wood of Horton Hall near Bradford, one of the largest worsted spinners in the country. Whilst an existing (virtually un-enforceable) Factory Act specified a minimum age and maximum hours of work for children in cotton mills, it did not apply to other textile industries (such as: silk, flax, woollen and worsted ). Wood, unhappy at the hours and conditions of work for children in Yorkshire worsted mills and his inability to persuade his competitors to ameliorate them, explained his concerns to Oastler and got him to promise to &quot;remove from our factory system the cruelties which are practised in our mills&quot;. Oastler wrote the next day a letter to the Leeds Mercury the leading West Riding newspaper contrasting speeches made at Yorkshire anti-slavery meetings with the treatment of children in Yorkshire factories – &quot;Yorkshire Slavery&quot;:

Thousands of our fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects, both male and female, the miserable inhabitants of a Yorkshire town, (Yorkshire now represented in Parliament by the giant of anti-slavery principles) are this very moment existing in a state of slavery, more horrid than are the victims of that hellish system &#x27;colonial slavery&#x27; These innocent creatures drawl out, unpitied, their short but miserable existence, in a place famed for its profession of religious zeal, whose inhabitants are ever foremost in professing &#x27;temperance&#x27; and &#x27;reformation&#x27; and are striving to outrun their neighbours in missionary exertions, and would fain send the Bible to the farthest corner of the globe aye, in the very place where the anti-slavery fever rages most furiously, her apparent charity is not more admired on earth, than her real cruelty is abhorred in Heaven. The very streets which receive the droppings of an &#x27;Anti-Slavery Society&#x27; are every morning wet by the tears of innocent victims at the accursed shrine of avarice, who are compelled (not by the cart-whip of the negro slave-driver) but by the dread of the equally appalling thong or strap of the over-looker, to hasten, half -dressed, but not half-fed, to those magazines of British infantile slavery the worsted mills in the town and neighbourhood of Bradford!!!
After a fortnight&#x27;s delay, the Mercury published the letter. This triggered correspondence; it became clear that other readers of the Mercury were also perturbed at conditions for children not only in the worsted industry, but also in other unregulated textile trades carried out in the West Riding. Oastler took up the cause of factory regulation. However, the millowners organised to resist any attempt to regulate their mills.

===Halifax resolutions – breach with the &quot;Mercury&quot;===

In 1831, John Cam Hobhouse put forward a Bill to extend the Factory Act to other textile industries; Yorkshire millowners opposing the Bill met at Halifax and passed anti-Bill resolutions which the &quot;Mercury&quot; printed with an editorial endorsing the resolutions and opposing Hobhouse&#x27;s Bill. Oastler wrote a long letter to the &quot;Mercury&quot; criticising the resolutions and reiterating the need for factory regulation. The &quot;Mercury&quot; printed his letter but omitted his detailed criticism of the resolutions, telling readers it had not printed the full letter because it &#x27;outraged the judgement&#x27; and exceeded &#x27;the bounds of reason and justice&#x27;, objection being particularly taken to his &#x27;brimstone rhetoric&#x27;. Oastler took great exception to this; the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot;, the great (Tory) rival of the (Whig) &quot;Mercury&quot; was happy to print the letter in full, including such passages as:Resolution 3 – attempts to persuade the public that if the manufacturers are not allowed to continue their present cruelties, the children will be starved and unemployed, and that, &quot;as these poor children are the main support of their strong and healthy parents&quot;, why, forsooth, the parents must starve too! That compelling the masters to treat their children better &quot;will REDUCE wages&quot;, and, what is very singular, &quot;will, at the same time RAISE THE PRICE of goods to the consumers&quot;. Thus destroying &quot;at one fell swoop&quot; the maker, the buyer, the consumer – both the home and foreign markets will be lost – the agricultural and landed proprietor ruined:- all this they say will be the consequences if poor little English children are protected from the cruelty and oppression of their worse than Egyptian task-masters. Happy England, whose very existence depends upon thy cruelty to infants! ... Self interest and avarice, and &quot;not necessity&quot; now goad thee on to ruin. England, beware! Let her inhabitants consider. They pretend to be Christians, and their God hath said – &quot;If thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgement and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.&quot; &quot;But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days.&quot; &quot;Rob not the poor because he is poor, for the Lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of those who spoil them&quot; &quot;Deliver the poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked.&quot; &quot;If the poor curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him.&quot;&quot; &quot;A prayer out of a poor man&#x27;s mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his reproach cometh speedily.&quot; &quot;He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker.&quot;&quot;

From this time forward, Oastler used the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; as the chief outlet for his letters. The &quot;Leeds Patriot&quot;, a Radical newspaper, commented favourably on the letter and gave Oastler its support on the issue.

===&#x27;Fixby Hall Compact&#x27; – common cause with the Radicals===
Short Time Committees (predominantly (but not exclusively) organisations of millhands in which Radicals and trades unionists were prominent) had sprung up in the West Riding textile towns (and also in Lancashire) to secure Parliamentary legislation regulating the hours of work in textile mills (for children explicitly, and with the further aim that regulation would be by means which meant that adults worked the same hours). After Hobhouse&#x27;s Bill was lost when a General Election was precipitated by defeat of the Reform Bill, a deputation from the Huddersfield &#x27;Short Time Committee&#x27; called on Oastler at Fixby and agreed with him (the &#x27;Fixby Hall Compact&#x27;of 19 June 1831) to combine their efforts on the issue despite fundamental differences on other political issues.

===&#x27;The Factory King&#x27;===

Hobhouse reintroduced his Bill, but a combination of the pressure of parliamentary (Reform Bill) business and determined opposition by millowner MPs and MPs lobbied by millowners meant that although an Act was passed, it had lost virtually every significant provision in the original Bill. Michael Thomas Sadler, advised by Oastler, then introduced a &#x27;Ten-Hour Bill&#x27; for which the Short Time Committees organised mass demonstrations of support. Oastler spoke at these meetings, soon showing himself to be &quot;one of the most accomplished popular orators that ever addressed a large assembly of the working classes&quot;. At a monster demonstration by West Riding textile workers at York (Easter 1832) he said &quot;We will have our Act, whatever Parliament will vote&quot;; the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; seized upon this as showing even less respect than the King for the judgement of Parliament, and mockingly dubbed him &#x27;King Richard&#x27; and hence &#x27;the Factory King&#x27;, a title Oastler was happy to accept. More significantly, Oastler urged his listeners that at future elections they should work for the return of candidates supporting a ten-hour bill, whatever their other political views. Sadler&#x27;s bill failed to complete its passage through the Commons before Parliament was dissolved Thornhill (Oastler&#x27;s employer) had had no objection to Oastler campaigning for factory reform, but intervened when told that at Huddersfield (where no Tory was standing in the 1832 election) Oastler was working for the return of a Radical.

===Althorp&#x27;s Act (1833)- the ten-hour movement outflanked===
Sadler failed to be elected to Parliament, and Parliament decided that a Factory Commission should make a thorough investigation of the matter to provide a sound basis for any further factory legislation. The Short Time movement saw no need for further investigation and Lord Ashley – now the champion of factory reform in the Commons – introduced another Ten-Hour Bill without waiting for the Commission&#x27;s report. The short time committees of the textile districts organised mass demonstrations for a Ten-Hour Act, the rhetoric becoming more heated (&quot;Tt is a question of blood against gold. Infants&#x27; blood has been sold for nought, but if we are despised now., it shall be a question of blood in another sense&quot; Oastler told a vast demonstration at Wibsey Low Moor at the start of July) as the aim was no longer seen to be convincing the public of the need for factory reform, but rather deterring the government from using the Commission to avoid any meaningful reform. They attempted to organise a boycott of the Commission and to ensure that wherever the Commissioners went in the textile districts they were met with large demonstrations for a Ten-Hour Bill, and against the Commissioners. Oastler was the &#x27;centre of communication&#x27; for the organisation, and prominent in the agitation against the Commission. When the Commission&#x27;s report came out, it recommended an eight-hour day for children under thirteen, with a declared aim of allowing mills to operate sixteen hours a day by a &#x27;relay system&#x27; employing two sets of children. This addressed the issue of child labour on which the short time movement had been able to gain public sympathy without giving any restriction on adult hours of work. Despite winning a number of Parliamentary votes, Ashley was unable to secure a majority for key clauses in his Bill, and withdrew it, leaving the way open for Lord Althorp to pilot through a Factory Act in line with the Commission recommendations. 
The 1833 Factory Act was unsatisfactory not merely to the Ten-Hour movement but to all interested parties. Members of the government had openly described Althorp&#x27;s Act as &#x27;an evil forced upon the Government&#x27;. Mill-owners (whether reconciled to the principle of state intervention or not) objected that the textile districts did not have the significant pool of unemployed children needed for a &#x27;relay system&#x27;: it was therefore virtually impossible to attempt to comply with the Act. Furthermore, mill-owner magistrates, who had been barred from hearing cases brought under the previous Factory Acts, were allowed to hear cases under the 1833 Act, which they saw no point in enforcing: only if non-compliance came to the attention of a Factory Inspector (given powers to act as a magistrate by the Act) was there any prospect of a successful prosecution

===Blackburn speech of 1836===
Oastler&#x27;s agitation for a Ten-Hour Act having failed, he was temporarily swept aside in favour of a Society for Promoting National Regeneration, the brainchild of John Doherty and Robert Owen, which aimed to secure an eight-hour day by concerted strike action but failed to organise a general strike of textile workers (partly because of pre-emptive anti-union action by millowners). Another Ten-Hour Bill was now contemplated for 1836, but was pre-empted by a government Bill to weaken the existing Act by reducing the age up to which only an eight-hour day could be worked to twelve. Oastler played a prominent part in agitation against the government Bill and for the introduction of a revived Ten-Hour Bill. The government Bill was withdrawn after it secured a majority of only two at Second Reading; the campaign for a Ten-Hour Act continued, but was seriously set back by a speech Oastler made at Blackburn in September 1836. The &quot;Blackburn Standard&quot; (a friend of the Ten-Hour Bill) published only an expurgated account of the meeting at which Oastler spoke, preceding it with an editorial in which they deplored the speeches of him and his fellow orators: Such of the sentiments to which they gave utterance, as we deem safe to publish, we report at some length in other columns, but we must say, that they delivered a vast deal of empty, impudent, nonsensical, mischievous, and disgusting balderdash, which we consider it to be our duty to exclude altogether from the Standard. ... we much regret that the management of this important ... measure should have fallen into the hands of these injudicious advocates. We do not hesitate to aver that they have, in one night, done more injury to the cause of the factory operatives in this town, by the disgraceful advice which they tendered to their hearers ... than the true friends of the people can repair by the most strenuous attention for many months. It is not surprising that Christian ministers decline to join in a crusade where the leaders are utterly devoid of Christian charity, and reckless of the consequences of their violence
The &quot;Standard&quot; therefore did not report that Oastler had talked of teaching children to sabotage mill machinery,; this was however seized upon by his opponents such as the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; which urged that either &#x27;his friends should put him under some restraint&#x27; or &#x27;the law should interpose to end the career of wickedness which he seems disposed to run&#x27;. In a justificatory letter to the &quot;Guardian&quot; Oastler said that he was only advocating sabotage where (as at Blackburn) magistrates were denying justice to factory children by openly refusing to enforce the Factory Act. &quot;If after this your magistrates should refuse to listen to your complaints under the factory act and again refer you to me, bring with you your children and tell them to ask their grandmothers for a few of their old knitting needles which I will instruct them how to apply to the spindles in a way which will teach these law-defying mill owner magistrates to have respect even to &#x27;Oastler&#x27;s law* as they have wrongly designated the factory law.&quot; 

This caused widespread outrage and the rupture of relationships with Ashley and Wood the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; ceased to publish his letters : John Fielden however stood by him . Oastler&#x27;s health broke down at the end of 1836; a meeting at Manchester in January 1837 was told he was unable to address it as &#x27;his exertions on behalf of the factory slave had brought him to the edge of the grave&#x27;

==&#x27;The fiend-begotten ...new Poor Law&#x27;==

 Less than a fortnight later, though, he was back in action at a mass meeting in Huddersfield, but in a new cause : delivering a speech (subsequently published under the (representative) title of Damnation! Eternal damnation to the fiend-begotten &#x27;coarser-food&#x27;, new Poor Law !) urging resistance to implementation of the &#x27;New Poor Law&#x27;. In the preface to this speech, Oastler denounced the Poor Law Amendment Act as an unjust, unChristian measure, declaring 

===The Poor Law Amendment Act===
Alarmed at the cost of poor relief in the southern agricultural districts of England (where in many areas it had become a semi-permanent top-up of labourers&#x27; wages – the &#x27;allowance system&#x27;, &#x27;Roundsman system&#x27;, or &#x27;Speenhamland system&#x27; ) Parliament had set up a Royal Commission into the operation of the Poor Laws. Its report had recommended sweeping changes:
* Out-relief should cease – relief should be given only in workhouses, and upon such terms that only the truly indigent would accept it.
* Different classes of paupers (men, women, boys, girls; able-bodied, infirm) should be segregated &quot;the separation of man and wife was necessary, in order to ensure the proper regulation of workhouses&quot;
* There should be a central board with powers to specify standards of pauper treatment and to enforce those standards; this could not be done directly by Parliament because of the legislative workload that would ensue.
The ensuing Poor Law Amendment Act set up a three-man Poor Law Commission, an &#x27;at arms&#x27; length&#x27; quango to which Parliament delegated the power to make appropriate regulations, without making any provision for effective oversight of the Commission&#x27;s doings. Local poor-rates payers still elected their local Board of Poor Law Guardians and still paid for local poor law provisions, but those provisions could be specified to the Board of Guardians by the Poor Law Commission; where they were the views of the local rate-payers were irrelevant. The Act was passed by large majorities, despite Oastler personally lobbying Tory leaders (including the Duke of Wellington) to oppose it. Oastler&#x27;s objections were that the Act pursued aims dictated by political economy by un-Christian treatment of the poor (and particularly of the married poor: &quot;whom God hath joined together let no man part asunder&quot;), and to ensure this was done with consistent heartlessness was setting up an unconstitutional body. Oastler told the Duke &quot;if that Bill passes, the man who can produce the greatest confusion in the country will be the greatest patriot, and I will try to be that man&quot;. The chairman of the Commission was Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis, an exact contemporary of Thornhill at Eton

===Resistance to the New Poor Law===
The new dispensation was implemented progressively, starting with the southern counties of England, where it achieved a considerable reduction in the poor rates. Not until January 1837 were the first steps taken to introduce the system into the West Riding by setting up &#x27;poor law unions&#x27; and electing Boards of Guardians for them. The Poor Law Boards were then to appoint a clerk to administer whatever system of relief was specified for that Union by the central Commission. The Commission intended (or said they intended) to allow the new Poor Law Boards in manufacturing areas to continue out-relief, but opponents of the New Poor Law held that best way to defend out-relief was to prevent new Poor Law Boards being established (or clerks to Poor Law Boards being appointed), since their existence would greatly facilitate the cessation of out-relief should the Commission change its mind (or not be telling the truth). Short Time Committee men played a prominent part in organising protest meetings, disruption of Poor Law Board meetings (Keighley, Huddersfield) and/or election of anti- Poor Law &#x27;Poor Law Guardians&#x27; (Huddersfield).

A meeting of Fixby rate-payers agreed to take no part in the election of a Poor Law Guardian; Thornhill instructed his tenants (through Oastler) that they should. Oastler passed on the instruction, but wrote back to Thornhill defending opposition to the appointment of guardians, concluding his letter &quot;But it is no use my writing about these matters -you cannot understand me. My living is in your hands – my conscience is my own. Oastler played little active part in the resistance until May. In April–May 1837, he campaigned on the Ten-Hour Bill and the Poor Law &quot;a gross &amp; wicked law .. if it was truth, the Bible was a lie&quot; at a by-election in Huddersfield, but was defeated by 50 votes by the Whig candidate.

Oastler was a leading light in a series of intimidatory pickets of meetings of the Huddersfield Guardians. Violence at the third of these (in June) went beyond anything Oastler intended or would countenance (when the guardians refused to receive a deputation, demonstrators stormed the workhouse building and dispersed the meeting; when the meeting reconvened at a local hotel stones were thrown through the windows) but the crowd ignored Oastler&#x27;s appeals to disperse, and Oastler had to personally shield the parish officers. The (Tory) Huddersfield magistrates threatened to read the Riot Act. but did not do so. A fresh election was held in July (Parliament automatically being dissolved on the death of King William IV); Oastler stood again at Huddersfield, and was again defeated by 22 votes by a different Whig opponent. When Oastler fell behind in the poll, a mob attacked the hustings and polling had to be suspended: the Riot Act was read and the cavalry called out to restore order. At the subsequent West Riding hustings at Wakefield, Oastler and a contingent from Huddersfield were prominent in the fighting between Whig and anti-Whig forces in which two people died.

At the start of May 1838, Oastler suffered another collapse. Whilst he was recovering, Thornhill dismissed him. Thornhill&#x27;s letter noted that Oastler had become steward on the basis that this was a full-time job and complained that Oastler had not attended to estate affairs as Thornhill would have wished, but did not go into further details. Despite his convalescence and his dismissal, Oastler continued his activities as a polemicist (e.g. his open letter to Earl Fitzwilliam) and an orator. Lord Howick had dismissed petitions against the New Poor Law on the grounds that they came largely from areas where the new law was not yet in operation; the true views of the agricultural labourers in the areas where it had been applied was approbation as shown by agrarian unrest being much less than in 1830. Oastler responded in a speech in Halifax in July; telling his audience that there was little point in petitioning: the agricultural labourers had petitioned and government had laughed at them; they were now arming secretly. That could only lead to assassinations; better by far to arm openly, as was their right; the government and the poor law administrators would then treat them more civilly:
&quot;I would recommend you, every one, before next Saturday night, to have a brace of horse pistols, a good sword and a musket, and to hang them up on your mantelpieces (not by any means to use them). &quot;They&quot; will petition for you&quot;
As with the Blackburn speech, this alarmed and alienated moderate support.

The Anti-Poor Law agitation was however rapidly overtaken and supplanted as the great working-class Radical cause by the more sweeping Chartist movement, (whose constitutional program Oastler did not support); when that collapsed in 1839 (with the failure of the National Petition and a Government crackdown with many leaders arrested and charged with seditious speeches and involvement in unlawful assemblies), so did organised resistance to the New Poor Law. Many of Oastler&#x27;s associates were involved in Chartism, and Oastler did not disown them: he played a prominent part in raising funds for the defence of J R Stephens; his last public campaigning for 5 years.

==Imprisonment for debt==
The prosecution of Chartist leaders did not include Oastler because, as Lord John Russell told the House of Commons, the Anti-Poor Law agitation &quot;was of a nature very difficult to meet by any execution of the laws of the country; for it was not applied to any purposes for the overturning of the institutions or the laws of the country or any particular political purpose; but pretended solely to an exclusive regard for the interests of the poorer classes, and whatever could be done for their benefit.&quot; Nonetheless, Oastler was to spend over three years in prison.

===Previous difficulties with Thornhill===
By Oastler&#x27;s own account, there had been past disagreements between him and Thornhill.
Fixby was entailed, and would not be inherited by Thornhill&#x27;s children (including his only son) by his first wife but by his daughter by a second marriage. 
Thornhill therefore wished to maximise the profits from Fixby and use them to build up his unentailed properties (worth roughly £22,000 a year) which his son could inherit. Oastler, however, administered Fixby less in accordance with Thornhill&#x27;s wishes than with the former practice of Thornhill&#x27;s father: he would not employ labourers at less than a living wage, nor let farms at rents too high to allow the tenant&#x27;s prosperity; callers at Fixby on estate business were offered a drink, and their horses were stabled. In 1834, accusations/advice by third parties led Thornhill to dismiss his sub-agent at Calverley for dishonesty. Oastler thought this unjustified (and was aggrieved that his views had not been sought); he therefore prepared to offer his resignation. In doing so he drew up accounts which showed that the expenses he had considered necessary to maintain the good name of Fixby and of Thornhill exceeded his salary; Oastler was indebted to the estate by over £2,700. Thornhill had not at the time seen this as implying any dishonesty and had refused Oastler&#x27;s resignation and increased his salary (but advised greater economy in future, and secured a promissory note from Oastler for the £2,700). By July 1837, despite Oastler&#x27;s election campaigns and his anti-Poor Law activities, the debt was under £1750.

===From dismissal to prison===
Oastler had previously told other anti-Poor Law campaigners that Frankland Lewis was urging Thornhill to sack him, and his dismissal was described in various sympathetic papers as &quot;the rewards of independent resistance of Whig tyranny&quot;. Placards advertising a procession to pay tribute to Oastler as he left Fixby (August 1838) offended Thornhill; he wrote a letter for publication saying that Oastler had been sacked, not because of his anti-Poor Law activities, but &quot;because he converted my money to his own use, and paid so little attention to my concerns and his duty that the persons employed under him have cheated me&quot; Thornhill&#x27;s letter was written at Cowes (17 August 1838) and hence without the knowledge of his legal adviser, who (once shown it) persuaded Thornhill to instead send to the papers a letter (also dated as from Cowes, 17 August) saying that Oastler had been sacked because he owed Thornhill money and was devoting his efforts to politics, rather than repaying the debt. Through the incompetence of Oastler&#x27;s successor as steward of Fixby both letters were published in (different) Yorkshire papers. &quot;He found he had gone too far, and having by his first letter dug a pit for his reputation, he writes another by way of putting a tombstone on it&quot; said Oastler, but his promissory note put him at Thornhill&#x27;s mercy.

Thornhill went to law for prompt payment of the full sum due; he did so in Middlesex because he thought a Yorkshire jury would be prejudiced. In January 1839 Oastler failed to have the case heard in Yorkshire; at this stage Oastler intended his defence to involve all the estate business during Oastler&#x27;s stewardship, and Oastler anticipated calling about 60 Yorkshire-based witnesses. Thornhill repeatedly postponed the action, which was not heard until July 1840. After the opening statement of Thornhill&#x27;s counsel, Oastler said if his honesty was not being questioned he was prepared to settle. The Lord Chief Justice assured Oastler that there was no suggestion of dishonesty (Thornhill&#x27;s counsel said only there had been no suggestion of dishonesty in the material he had laid before the court); there was an agreed verdict that Oastler owed Thornhill £2600. He was unable to pay this: Thornhill&#x27;s lawyer indicated that any indication that Oastler was prepared to declare himself bankrupt (under the Relief of Insolvent Debtors Act) if faced with debtors&#x27; prison would avoid any move to put him there, but Oastler scorned this and was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison (Dec 1840).

===Fleet Papers===
Oastler&#x27;s imprisonment brought reconciliation with former allies who had broken with him, and visits and gifts not only from his supporters from every class but also from political opponents who thought Thornhill&#x27;s conduct oppressive. Various intercessions on his behalf with Thornhill were fruitless; to a resolution passed by a Leeds meeting Thornhill replied &quot;that I have no enmity towards Mr Oastler, but that after the treatment I have received from him, I cannot in justice to myself, or my family, set him at liberty, without security for his debt to me.&quot;
In prison Oastler wrote (weekly) his &quot;Fleet Papers&quot;, ostensibly letters addressed to Thornhill reviewing current political affairs, published and sold for 2d per issue . This was the only means by which he could earn money, and the only way he could continue to resist the advances of &#x27;political economy&#x27;: &quot;I can only now aid by my pen; but I will strive to do the duty of an Englishman, and, &quot;whether they will hear or they will forbear,&quot; I will warn the people of the danger to which the &quot;Liberal&quot; schemes of the self-styled Free-trading Philosophers must eventually lead them.&quot;. Mixed with current politics were explanations of past events in his life and accounts of visits and gifts by sympathisers and well-wishers, and of life in the Fleet. A contrast with Thornhill&#x27;s lifestyle was always lurking, and sometimes made. 

===Oastler ransomed===

When Oastler was dismissed, an &#x27;Oastler Testimonial Fund&#x27; had been inaugurated, intended to raise enough money to provide an adequate income for Oastler. This had not been successful, and on Oastler&#x27;s imprisonment transformed itself into an &#x27;Oastler Liberation Fund&#x27;; this initially also stalled well short of its target until relaunched in the summer of 1843 by an editorial in &quot;The Times&quot;, followed by fund-raising meetings held across the factory districts and reported nationally. As with the gifts to Oastler in the Fleet, donations to the liberation fund came from across the political spectrum. By January 1844, over £2000 had been raised, but the debt had risen to nearly £3200 and there were concerns about Oastler&#x27;s health. To secure his release, wealthy supporters guaranteed the shortfall, and Oastler was released in February 1844. On Shrove Tuesday 1844, a procession and meeting to mark his liberation were held at Huddersfield; he told the meeting that he now had no animosity towards his opponents, and that violent language was no longer necessary; the press and the public now fully supported further factory legislation and reform of the New Poor Law.

==After prison==
Oastler, initially recuperating at a nephew&#x27;s country house, was soon drawn into a series of public meetings agitating for a Ten-Hour Bill, in the aftermath of the Government asserting that millworkers no longer wished for a Ten-Hour Act and making the retention of a twelve-hour limit in the 1844 Factory Act a question of confidence. He was now only a support speaker, and his speeches kept to the less violent tone promised at his Huddersfield homecoming.

In July 1844, having been advised by his Liberation Committee that money was not forthcoming to support him in public life, he advertised himself in Leeds papers as &quot;Umpire, Arbitrator, Agent for the Purchase or Sale of Estates, and for Obtaining or Opposing Private Bills in Parliament&quot;. He was a Leeds sharebroker in 1845, by 1846 he was working in a London stockbroking office; in 1849 he was made bankrupt. Thereafter, Oastler was discreetly supported by his friends; from 1851 he edited a periodical &quot;The Home&quot; but this was never a paying proposition and closed in 1855.

In the autumn of 1846 he was summoned from retirement, by the West Riding Short-Time Committee, to be the principal speaker at public meetings to demonstrate the millworkers&#x27; continuing support for a Ten-Hour Act; following this he undertook a similar speaking tour of textile areas in Scotland.
The Ten Hours&#x27; Act was passed in 1847, but Oastler continued to be relied upon as a spokesman for the Short Time movement, pressing for full implementation of the Act and the outlawing of the &#x27;false relay system&#x27;; he supported the unsuccessful opposition to the 1850 &#x27;Compromise Act&#x27;, accusing Lord Ashley of &quot;betraying the poor&quot;. He continued to argue for Protection, and against Free Trade and the &quot;Manchester School&quot;, but his appearances at Short Time meetings were now to receive congratulatory addresses, to reminisce, and to pay tribute to former colleagues in the struggle. After an &#x27;alarming illness&#x27; at the start of 1861, he recovered sufficiently to again visit Yorkshire to see old friends, but was taken ill en route near Harrogate (8 August 1861) and died there a fortnight later. He was buried in the family vault at Kirkstall, Leeds: he had asked for a simple and private funeral, but many of his old Short Time comrades attended and at their insistence the coffin was carried by twelve factory workers.

==Memorials==

At the nadir of Oastler&#x27;s fortunes in 1840, the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; told its readers &quot;Important religious, moral, and social consequences have been the fruits of his herculean labours, and it is probable that posterity will decree him a statue&quot;. After Oastler&#x27;s death a national subscription was raised for a permanent memorial to Oastler. The &quot;Intelligencer&quot;, supporting this, noted that the Ten Hour Act had been so beneficial that it could not serve as that memorial. The ten-hour day was now accepted as normal and proper: consequently it was now passing from remembrance that &quot;the agitation in favour of it was by no means well received, and the struggle that won it was a hard one&quot;.
The money to erect a statue was raised (somewhat delayed by the Cotton Famine) and the West Riding town in which the statue was to be erected was voted for by subscribers, Bradford being the overwhelming preference. The statue was unveiled in Forster Square, Bradford (in front of the railway station) on Whit Saturday 1869 by the former Lord Ashley, now Lord Shaftesbury. Church bells were rung and all places of business in Bradford were shut for the occasion. It was estimated that the preliminary procession had involved about 30,000; the crowds at the ceremony and along the procession route totalling over 100,000. The figures, sculpted by John Birnie Philip, were cast from three tons of bronze and cost £1,500. A public house (previously a chapel) in Park Street Market, Brighouse, and a school in the Armley district of Leeds, West Yorkshire, also bear his name.

<text>Gyo Obata (小圃 暁, February 28, 1923 – March 8, 2022) was an American architect, the son of painter Chiura Obata and his wife, Haruko Obata, a floral designer. In 1955, he co-founded the global architectural firm HOK (formerly Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum). He lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and worked in HOK&#x27;s St. Louis office. He designed several notable buildings, including the McDonnell Planetarium and GROW Pavilion at the Saint Louis Science Center, the Independence Temple of the Community of Christ church, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois.

==Biography==

Obata was born and raised in San Francisco. Due to his family&#x27;s Japanese heritage, he was nearly interned with other Japanese-Americans during World War II. Though his family was sent to an internment camp, he avoided it by leaving the School of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, to study architecture at the School of Architecture at Washington University in St. Louis, the only university in the United States willing to accept Japanese nationals at that time. He earned his bachelor of architecture degree there in 1945.

He then studied under master Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, receiving his master&#x27;s degree in architecture and urban design in 1946.

After serving in the U.S. Army from 1946 to 1947 and working as an architect in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill from 1947 to 1951, Obata returned to St. Louis in 1951 to join the firm of Minoru Yamasaki (who would later design the World Trade Center towers), another Nisei architect. Four years later, in 1955, he joined architects George Hellmuth and George Kassabaum in establishing the St. Louis-based architecture firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.

Due in part to Obata&#x27;s prowess and growing reputation, the firm achieved global renown, and Obata himself has won numerous awards for his designs. Today, HOK has more than 1,800 employees in 23 offices worldwide.

In 2010, Obata was featured in a book written by Marlene Ann Birkman and published by The Images Publishing Group titled, &quot;Gyo Obata: Architect | Clients | Reflections.&quot; The book features 30 of Obata&#x27;s projects (and clients) spanning five decades.

Obata&#x27;s design philosophy is &quot;to provide spaces which are not only functional, but also enhance the quality of life for those who work and live in them.&quot; In &quot;Gyo Obata: Architect | Clients | Reflections,&quot; he says that, &quot;The language that architects use to define space is daylight. Each project offers new potential for discovery, for understanding the site and program, and an opportunity to do a thoughtfully designed building that will bring meaning and enjoyment to the people who will occupy it.&quot;

Obata died in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 8, 2022, at the age of 99.

<doc id="756509" wikidata="Q2782424" url="?curid=756509" title="Lisa Scott-Lee">
<text>Lisa Scott-Lee (born 5 November 1975) is a British singer from St Asaph, Wales. She is a member of the pop group Steps, formed in 1997. Scott-Lee signed a record deal with Mercury Records and launched a solo career in 2003, achieving only minor success after the release of debut single &quot;Lately&quot;. She was dropped after her second solo single. She released her debut solo album &quot;Never or Now&quot; in 2007 through Concept Records.

==Early life and education==
Lisa Scott-Lee was born on 5 November 1975 in St Asaph to parents Anthony and Janet. Her younger siblings are Andy, Anthony and Steven, who were in the group 3SL. She attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts stage school.

==Career==
===1997–2001: early career with Steps===

Scott-Lee is a member of the UK pop group Steps. The group, which came together in 1997 and had 14 top 5 singles in the UK, split up on Boxing Day 2001 before reforming in May 2011.

Ever since the group&#x27;s break-up, rumours had been circulating that they would reunite in one form or another. In 2009, Lee Latchford-Evans revealed that the group had been approached to perform a series of concerts. He hinted that a future reunion was possible, but that &quot;it isn&#x27;t the right time right now&quot;.

===2002–2008: Solo career and &quot;Totally Scott-Lee&quot;===
Scott-Lee spent a short time managing her three younger brothers, including Andy, in a group of their own called 3SL. After little success they were dropped from their label and disbanded. Scott-Lee then signed a solo recording contract with Mercury Records, releasing her debut solo single, &quot;Lately&quot;, which she co-wrote, in May 2003. The song became a UK top 10 hit, peaking at number 6. On 8 September 2003, Scott-Lee released her second single (which she also co-wrote), &quot;Too Far Gone&quot;, which narrowly missed out on the top 10, peaking at number 11. Mercury parted company with Scott-Lee when they feared her success as a solo artist might be limited, which left her without a record company. As a result, her album, &quot;Unleashed&quot;, was cancelled, although promotional samplers had already been released.

Scott-Lee went on to be featured in the Girls of FHM music video for &quot;Do You Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; in the summer of 2004, while preparing to release a new single, &quot;Get It On&quot;, with Intenso Project. As both Scott-Lee and Intenso Project did not have a record deal, the music video was self-funded. Eventually Ministry of Sound picked up the song and released it on 28 November 2004. Despite numerous personal appearances, various promotional events, and a B-list placing on Capital Radio, the song peaked at number 23. The &quot;Get It On&quot; music video, however, was ranked in the FHM top 100 sexiest music videos.

In the summer of 2005 it was revealed that a camera crew from MTV UK had been following Scott-Lee, as well as her husband (Johnny Shentall of Hear&#x27;Say), her brother (Andy Scott-Lee), her publicist (Sean Borg), her manager (Nathan Moore), and her brother&#x27;s girlfriend Michelle Heaton (of Liberty X) for nearly a year. The show, which was intended as the UK version of MTV&#x27;s US hit &quot;&quot; followed Scott-Lee&#x27;s atttempts to revitalize her career. In the show, titled &quot;Totally Scott-Lee&quot; (originally &quot;Scott-Lee Unlimited&quot;), Scott-Lee vowed that she would quit the music industry if her next release missed the UK top 10.

Scott-Lee was signed to a small record label, Concept Records, and began recording songs for her next single. Concept chose &quot;Electric&quot; and started making plans for its release. The single had to be released on 10 October 2005 to meet with deadlines for the show, with the chart position to be revealed live on MTV on Sunday 16 October 2005. Roseann McBride, assistant to managing director Max Bloom of Concept Records went on record several times to indicate that she was against the record being released on this date, as it would have very little promotion time (5 weeks as opposed to the usual 8–10 weeks). The song was released as planned, but despite a television show backing her and extensive media coverage, it failed to reach the top ten, charting at number 13.

Following the chart reveal Sott-Lee indicated she regretted her earlier vow, admitting she had only agreed to it to please other people and wished she had never said it.

Following the failure of &quot;Electric&quot; to achieve its targeted top 10 position, plans were announced to release &quot;Electric&quot; in Japan, Australia, Germany and South Africa. In Australia, &quot;Electric&quot; spent two weeks in the Top 100, but failed to reach the Top 40. She went to South Africa and Germany to promote the single and released &quot;Boy on the Dancefloor&quot;, a song from her then-unreleased album, on her website as a Christmas gift to her fans in 2005.

On 1 October 2006 it was announced that Scott-Lee would &quot;film a great new TV show for mainstream TV&quot; on her official website. It later emerged that the TV show in question was the second series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, although this was not officially confirmed until late December 2006. Her participation in &quot;Dancing On Ice&quot; began on 20 January 2007. On 24 February 2007 she lost in the dance off, finishing in 6th place. Scott-Lee&#x27;s association with &quot;Dancing On Ice&quot; continued between March and May 2007 when she took part in Dancing on Ice: The Tour which toured across the UK.

Scott-Lee&#x27;s first full-length solo album was &quot;Never or Now&quot;. The UK digital release date was supposed to be 26 March, presumably to capitalise on her success in &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. However, following her defeat in the sixth episode, the debut album was delayed again. It was released in South Africa by Sheer Music on 26 March 2007 and in the UK as a music download on 18 June 2007. A CD version was also released in Belgium and the Netherlands.

<text>Dositej Obradović (, ; 17 February 1739 – 7 April 1811) was a Serbian writer, biographer, diarist, philosopher, pedagogue, educational reformer, linguist and the first minister of education of Serbia. An influential protagonist of the Serbian national and cultural renaissance, he advocated Enlightenment and rationalist ideas, while remaining a Serbian patriot and an adherent of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Dositej Obradović was born Dimitrije Obradović, probably in 1739, in the Banat village of Čakovo, in the Habsburg monarchy, now Ciacova, in present-day Romania. From an early age, he was possessed with a passion for study. Obradović grew up bilingual (in Serbian and Romanian) and learned classical Greek, Latin, modern Greek, German, English, French, Russian and Italian.

On 17 February 1757 he became a monk in the Serb Orthodox monastery of Hopovo, in the Srem region, and acquired the name &quot;Dositej&quot; (Dositheus). He translated into Serbian many European classics, including &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;. Having devoured the contents of the monastery library, he hungered for further learning. On 2 November 1760 he left the monastery of Hopovo, bound for Hilandar, Mount Athos.


=== Further education and travel ===
In 1761 he went to Zagreb where he studied Latin. From 1761 to 1763 he was a teacher in a Serbian school in Kninsko Polje. For a brief period, he taught at a monastery in the Bay of Kotor before he was ordained as a priest by Vasilije Petrović. After falling ill, he returned to teach in Dalmatia in the village of Golubić near Knin. He then went to Corfu where he studied Greek before going to Venice and then coming back to Dalmatia where he became a teacher again, in Plavno. He enrolled at the University of Halle in 1782, where he studied philosophy.

In 1783, he transferred to the University of Leipzig and published his first work. He was a student of Johann Eberhard who himself was a disciple of Christian Wolf. More than a third of his life was spent in Austria where Obradović became influenced by the ideas of Joseph II and the German Enlightenment. Additionally, he was an Anglophile and influenced by English educators, seeing England as the land of spiritual freedom and modern civilization. In 1785 Obradović presented his books printed in Leipzig to the British Museum Library in London. These were the first modern Serbian books acquired by the British Museum Library. Besides these countries, his forty-year travel journeys across Europe and Asia Minor also took him to Greece, Hungary, Turkey, Romania, France, Russia, England, and Poland.

=== Later life and death ===
At the time of the First Serbian Uprising (1804) Obradović was in Italy, where he published his pivotal poem Rise O Serbia (Vostani Serbije) in honor of Karađorđe Petrović and the insurgents. In Dositej&#x27;s song, Serbia is pictured as a ‘sleeping Beauty’, asleep for centuries. The verses call upon her to wake up and give an example to her ‘sisters’, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Montenegro. In 1807 Obradović moved to Belgrade at the invitation of Karađorđe Petrović, to become, in the newly organized government, Serbia&#x27;s first minister of education. In 1809 he founded Higher School, the first higher education institution in Serbia that later developed into a university. The school was located in a two-story building in Zajrek, one of the oldest parts of Belgrade. The building now serves as the Museum of Vuk and Dositej.

Obradović wrote first individual biographies and quickly the genre expanded to the form of biographical collection modelled on examples of Nepos, Suetonius, Plutarch, or Diogenes Laertius.

Obradović helped introduce to the Serbs the literature of certain western European countries. He and Vuk Karadžić, whom Obradović influenced, are recognized as the fathers of modern Serbian literature. Because the Serbian populace often suffered famine, Obradović also introduced potato cultivation to Serbia.

Dositej Obradović died in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1811. He was honored with a large funeral procession and buried in St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral. A monument to Obradović was errected by the Kalemegan park entrance in 1914. It was moved in 1930 to a prominent spot at the newly opened Academic Park, close to the University of Belgrade administration and governance building, where it still stands.

==In popular culture ==
*&quot;&quot;, a television miniseries based on the biography of Dositej Obradović and directed by Sava Mrmak, was produced in 1990 by the Serbian broadcasting service RTS.

<doc id="756514" wikidata="Q297557" url="?curid=756514" title="Miloš Obrenović">
<text>Miloš Obrenović (; ; 18 March 1780 or 1783 – 26 September 1860) born Miloš Teodorović (; ), also known as Miloš the Great () was the Prince of Serbia twice, from 1815 to 1839, and from 1858 to 1860. He was an eminent figure of the First Serbian uprising, the leader of the Second Serbian uprising, and the founder of the house of Obrenović. Under his rule, Serbia became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. Prince Miloš was an autocrat, consistently refusing to decentralize power, which gave rise to a strong internal opposition. Despite his humble background, he eventually became the most affluent man in Serbia and one of the wealthiest in the Balkans, possessing estates in Vienna, Serbia and Wallachia. During his rule, Miloš bought a certain number of estates and ships from the Ottomans and was also a prominent trader.

==Early life==
Miloš Teodorović was the son of Teodor &quot;Teša&quot; Mihailović (died 1802) from Dobrinja, and Višnja (died 18 June 1817). His family descended from the Bratonožići tribe. This was the second marriage of his mother Višnja, from which also sprung Jovan (1787–1850) and Jevrem (1790–1856). From Višnja&#x27;s first marriage, with Obren Martinović (died 1780) from Brusnica, Miloš had half-brothers Jakov (died 1811) and Milan (died 1810), and half-sister Stana. After the death of Obren, Višnja moved from Brusnica and married Teodor in Dobrinja.

Although many historians put 1780 as the year when Miloš was born, according to foundation plaque in the wall of the Old Church in Kragujevac, his capital, he was 35 when the church was finished in 1818, meaning that he was born in 1783. After the death of his brother Milan, a famed revolutionary with great reputation among the people, Miloš adopted the surname Obrenović. In official documents, his name was sometimes written Miloš Teodorović Obrenović (; ).

==First Serbian Uprising==

Miloš fought in the First Serbian uprising until its very end in 1813. He was wounded in the battle for Užice. His half-brother Milan also took part in the uprising, rising to become the voivode of the Rudnik district, until his death in 1810. After Milan&#x27;s death, Miloš adopted the surname of his half-brother, Obrenović. This name was the patronymic which his half-brother derived from Obren, the first name of his own father (Miloš&#x27;s step-father). After the rebellion collapsed, Miloš was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the returning Ottomans.

==Second Serbian Uprising==

In April 1815, Prince Miloš organized and led the Second Serbian uprising. After defeating the Turks, and Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in Russia, the Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815. After the killing of Karađorđe Petrović, in 1817, Obrenović became the leader of the Serbs. As a result of the agreement, Serbia gained some autonomy, but remained under Ottoman sovereignty. Miloš Obrenović was left in power as its absolute ruler.

Between the end of 1828 and the autumn of 1830, Prince Miloš created a so-called &quot;legislative commission&quot; to translate the Code Napoléon into Serbian and codify the laws and customs of the country. After discussing the commission, Miloš invited two distinguished legal specialists to come from Hungary to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for Serbia. They were Vasilije Lazarević, &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; (mayor) of Zemun, and Jovan Hadžić, lawyer, poet, and member of the municipal senate of Novi Sad.

In January 1831, Prince Miloš informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial edict from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The Sultan&#x27;s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made Serbia a sovereign principality, with Miloš Obrenović as hereditary prince. A Metropolitanate of Serbia was established in Belgrade as an autonomous unit of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Russia&#x27;s status as the guarantor of Serbia&#x27;s autonomy was also recognized.

==Reign==
The supporters of the rule of law often rebelled against Miloš&#x27;s government. Following one such rebellion, he agreed to adopt a constitution, the &quot;Sretenje&quot; or Candlemas constitution, in 1835. The move was opposed by neighboring Austria, the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia. It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. Metternich&#x27;s Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and foreign ministry. Miloš abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey, and it was replaced by the &quot;Turkish&quot; Constitution of 1838.

Miloš abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons—Milan, who died a few weeks later, and Mihailo, who then became prince. Mihailo was deposed in 1842, and the family was out of power until 1858, when it returned with Miloš restored as prince for the last two years of his life.

Thanks to his good contacts during his stay in Vienna, Johann Strauss II composed the &quot;Serben-Quadrille&quot; intended for Serbian balls.

==Legacy==
Miloš Obrenović was given the epithet &quot;the Great&quot;. He was proclaimed &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot; by the National Assembly.

<text>Edward Joseph Harrington O&#x27;Brien (December 10, 1890 – February 24, 1941) was an American writer, poet, editor and anthologist.

As Edward J. O&#x27;Brien, he created a series of annual anthologies containing his selection of the previous year&#x27;s best short stories by U.S. authors, &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; (originally &quot;The Best Short Stories of 1915&quot;, and so on). In that he was succeeded by Martha Foley, who continued the work until her own death in 1977 without a great change in format. 

He went to live in Europe in 1919. He married his first wife, English writer Romer Wilson, in 1923. Two years after her death in 1932, he married German writer Ruth Gorgel, who survived him.

He died at his home in Gerrards Cross, England. The cause of death was heart failure. At the time, he was the European story editor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s England studios.

<doc id="756533" wikidata="Q589934" url="?curid=756533" title="Maadi">
<text>Maadi ( ) is a leafy and once suburban district in the Southern Area of Cairo, Egypt, on the east bank of the Nile about upriver from downtown Cairo. The modern extensions north east and east of Maadi, New Maadi and Zahraa al-Maadi are administratively part of the Basatin district.

The Nile in Maadi is paralleled by the Corniche, a waterfront promenade and the main road north into Cairo. There is no bridge across the Nile at Maadi; the nearest one is located at El Mounib along the Ring Road (Tarik El-Da&#x27;eri, ) on the way north to the downtown.

Maadi&#x27;s population was estimated to be 85,000 according to the 2017 census. The district is popular with international expatriates as well as Egyptians and is home to many embassies, as well as major international schools, sporting clubs, and cultural institutions such as the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt and the national Egyptian Geological Museum.

==Name==
&quot;Maadi&quot; is the plural form of the word ( ), which means &quot;ferry&quot;; hence, el-Maadi literally means &quot;The ferries&quot;. The story goes that the name comes from a ferry crossing in the area where ferries carried people from the east side of the Nile to the west.

==History==
Maadi today stands on the site of a town that has turned out to be a significant predynastic, Ancient Egyptian archaeological site, founded ca. 3500 B.C. Building activity in the area has destroyed some archaeologically sensitive places.

In Middle Ages the area of Maadi became a Coptic monastic region comprising &quot;Deir at-Tin&quot; (, ) and &quot;Deir al-Adawiya&quot; (, ).

Maadi traces its modern history to 1904, when the railway between Cairo to the north and Helwan to the south was built. This, in combination with land speculation by the Mosseri cousins and city planning by Alexander Adams, gave rise to a new town. Construction was originally limited to the area adjacent to the railway, but eventually spread west to the Nile. Also, a large British army camp was built east of the railway.

The town planning was done in 1905 by a Canadian retired officer, Captain Alexander J. Adams. His vision led to the wide streets and large villas still seen in Maadi today. There were very strict rules associated with residential development in Maadi with regards to the size of houses, how much of the property could be occupied by the house and how much had to be left for the garden, and the size of the sidewalks. Even window shutters had prescribed colours. Other regulations included wireless radio noise control after 22:00 and fines for not maintaining gardens properly.
The world&#x27;s first solar thermal power station was built in Maadi.
An example of British colonial life in Maadi may be found in &quot;The house at Maadi&quot;, a short story by Gerald Bullett from his collection &quot;The street of the eye&quot; (1923).

===Second World War===

During the period between 1940 and 1945, Maadi had an important role in the Military of New Zealand during World War II.
The Divisional Cavalry Regiment disembarked on 14 February 1940 and entrained for the New Zealand base camp at Maadi. In total around 76,000 members of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force trained at a camp near Maadi at the base of the desert slopes of Wadi Degla and Tel al-Maadi. During that time this area belonged to the Delta Land Company which created Maadi in 1907. The rocky plateau was leased to the New Zealand Military Forces, and for the next six years it became the central depot and training area for 2 NZEF in the Middle East.

A British Army interrogation centre was also located in Maadi. In July 1942, at the height of the Western Desert Campaign, two German spies revealed under questioning that they had been using a copy of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;, found among their possessions, as a codebook for secret, coded radio transmissions. Their equipment, stored on a houseboat on the River Nile, had been examined by a young signals officer from the Egyptian Army, future President of Egypt Anwar Sadat.

===Post-1952 revolution===
Following the 1952 revolution (which ended the British occupation of the Suez Canal) and the 1956 Suez Crisis, in which Britain, France and Israel launched an invasion of Egypt to regain control of the canal, British and French expatriates living in Maadi and elsewhere were forced to leave by the Egyptian government. As a result, some of their institutions, such as St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, were taken over and run temporarily by other nationalities.

== Administrative divisions and population ==
Maadi is a district in the Southern Area of Cairo, and is subdivided into five shiakhas (census blocks).
In the 2017 census Maadi had a total population of 108,575 people spread over the five shiakhas as follows:
==Maadi today==

The oldest area in Maadi is El Sarayat, composed mostly of villas and low rise buildings. It is the most affluent part of Maadi along with the adjacent Degla area. These two areas are recognizable by the high number of roundabouts, quiet atmosphere and greenery.

There are many flats in Maadi, mostly in lowrise buildings. There are several highrises along the Corniche by the river, as well as in the newer, eastern part of Maadi, known as Degla.

The new Maadi areas include El-Laselky St. and the Autostrad, as well as Masaken El Arays, Saqr kuraish and the houses of the Kuwaiti company, and el basatin el sharkya. which is between saqr kuraish and the houses of the Kuwait company. It is characterized by the large number of oil companies, most notably the Gulf of Suez Oil Company, as well as some other companies.
The Arab region is also the most popular areas in Maadi and the Arab Maadi which is available from shops and crafts and various means of transport and its location, which connects all areas of Maadi.

Maadi is the highest densely populated district in Greater Cairo, and much of it is inhabited by well-to-do Egyptians, as well as expatriates, many of whom are connected with embassies, ambassadorial residences and international corporations located in Maadi. The Cairo office for the USAID is also located in Maadi.

Many streets in Maadi continue to have speed bumps as a traffic calming measure.

===Atmosphere===
Maadi has a reputation for being green, quieter and more relaxed than urban Cairo. In some parts of Maadi, most notably around Cairo American College, there is virtually no traffic noise. The abundant greenery bears little resemblance to most of the crowded areas seen in urban Cairo. This reputation is true of the original core of Maadi and Degla; however, outlying developments such as &quot;New Maadi&quot; have brought in the same treeless neighborhoods and mundane architecture as found in much of the rest of Cairo&#x27;s metropolitan sprawl.

===Economy and retail===
Along with its affluent residents, Maadi is home to many major restaurants, outlets and chains as well as a variety of high-end clothing shops, and other retail businesses, many of which are located along the locally famous &quot;Road 9&quot;, Nasr st, or new Maadi as well as Maadi&#x27;s original &quot;downtown&quot; located just south of the Maadi Metro stop on the east side of the track. Road 9 still remains a hub for both locals and expats with its diverse dining options as well as coffee shops and even bookstores. Most notably are expatriate owned businesses such as Lucille&#x27;s (known for their American style hamburgers) and The BookSpot (an English language bookstore that has become a staple for Egyptians and westerners for more than 15 years). Many businesses come and go but the residents of Maadi can always depend on Road 9 to make them feel right at home.

Taisei Corporation has its North Africa office in Maadi.

===Transportation===
Maadi is served by the Cairo Metro&#x27;s Line 1, which has now taken over the Cairo-to-Helwan railway. There are three stops in Maadi – from north to south: Hadayek El Maadi, Maadi and Sakanat (Thakanat) El Maadi. Further metro construction in Maadi is foreseen, especially related to Line 6, but nothing is beyond the proposal stage as yet.

Egyptian National Railways also operates a line through Maadi, although it is strictly a freight line. There is no longer any passenger service; the station is now closed.

===Nature protected areas in Maadi===
* Wadi Degla Protected Area
* Protected fossil trees

===Culture===
Cultural life in Maadi is geared to a great extent towards serving the large expatriate and affluent, bilingual Egyptian populations. For expatriates, Maadi offers a variety of community activities: religious institutions (many churches and a synagogue), amateur theatre groups, sporting clubs, adult courses, and other interest groups. The Maadi Sporting Club, for example, has served the local expat and Egyptian communities since 1921. It is also associated with the Maadi Sporting &amp; Yacht Club by the Nile. Maadi has also become a popular place for foreigners to study Arabic, as the suburb now hosts a number of local language schools.

Cultural venues include the new Egyptian Geological Museum and the large Maadi Library.

Cultural life, locally, largely revolves around dining out and shopping. In addition to numerous Western restaurant chains and cafés, Maadi offers a variety of international cuisine. The most popular places for westerners to shop at &quot;local&quot; stores is along Road 9. There are also international and multilingual bookshops selling foreign newspapers and magazines catering to Maadi&#x27;s multi-ethnic population.

==Educational institutions ==

Maadi has a variety of public and private schools. Here are some international schools in Maadi:
* Cairo American College
* Lycée Français du Caire Maadi Primary Campus
* Victory College
* Maadi Community School
* Al-Amal Semi-International School
* The Higher Institute of Engineering - Thebes Academy
* The Higher Institute of Computers - Thebes Academy
* Sadat Academy For Management Sciences

==Sport==
During World War II members of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force based at Maadi Camp competed in regattas on the Nile against local Egyptian rowing clubs. At a regatta held on 20 November 1943 the Maadi Camp Rowing Club &quot;Kiwi&quot; oarsmen beat the Cairo River Club by 11 points to six to win the Freyberg Cup, which they then gifted to the competitors. In return, as a token of friendship, Youssef Bahgat presented the Kiwis with a cup.

Youssef Bahgat&#x27;s cup was offered to the NZARA (now NZRA) as a trophy for an annual boys&#x27; eight-oared race between secondary schools and was brought to New Zealand at the end of the war. Renamed the Maadi Cup it was first raced for in 1947 at Wanganui where it was won by Mount Albert Grammar School. The Maadi Cup gained its native timber pyramid-shaped base from Mt Albert Grammar&#x27;s woodwork master, Jack Jenkin, in 1951.

The Maadi Sporting Club and Yacht, founded in 1920 by British expatriates who mainly worked at the Delta Real Estate Company, today offers a range of sports, such as Tennis, Football, Swimming, Squash, handball, hockey, Judo, Table Tennis, Sailing, and Rowing.

Victory College is no longer the home of a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s softball league; softball has not been played there since 2015.

<text>Achille Leone Occhetto (; born 3 March 1936) is an Italian political figure. He served as the last secretary-general of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) between 1988 and 1991, and was the first leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the parliamentary socialist successor of the PCI, from 1991 to 1994.

==Early life and career==
Occhetto was born in Turin. He served as secretary of the Italian Communist Youth Federation, to which he had belonged starting from 1953, from 1963 to 1966. Subsequently, he was the regional secretary of the PCI in Sicily, where he distinguished himself for his war against any kind of mafia.

In 1986, Occhetto was appointed as national coordinator of the PCI and became its secretary in 1988, succeeding Alessandro Natta. Under his leadership, the party witnessed the collapse of both the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. He responded by declaring the Communist state experience over, and persuaded the PCI to dissolve and refound itself as a democratic socialist party, the PDS. This political shift, known in Italian politics as the &quot;Svolta della Bolognina&quot; (the name derives from the celebration of a partisan battle in World War II), during which he announced that the PCI would change its name, logo, and orientation, was accepted by approximately 70% of the members at the 20th National Congress held on 8 February 1991.

In 1994, Occhetto challenged and was defeated by Silvio Berlusconi in the 1994 Italian general election, leading the Alliance of Progressives; because of this loss, he resigned as party secretary. He returned to politics in the 2004 European Parliament election in Italy, being elected to the European Parliament on a joint ticket with anti-corruption campaigner Antonio Di Pietro; he immediately resigned and was replaced by Giulietto Chiesa. After the 2006 Italian general election, he returned to the European Parliament by taking up one of the seats vacated by an elected deputy, and sat as an Independent member of the Party of European Socialists group. In 2009, he joined the new left-wing formation Left Ecology Freedom. He is an atheist.

==Personal life==
Occhetto was married to the activist and former actress Elisa Kadigia Bove, with whom he had two sons, Malcolm and Massimiliano (both born in Sicily); he was later married to fellow party member Aureliana Alberici.

<doc id="756543" wikidata="Q2154382" url="?curid=756543" title="Rio Hondo (California)">
<text>The Rio Hondo (Spanish: &quot;Río Hondo&quot;, meaning &quot;Deep River&quot;) is a tributary of the Los Angeles River in Los Angeles County, California, approximately long. As a named river, it begins in Irwindale and flows southwest to its confluence in South Gate, passing through several cities (though not the city of Los Angeles). Above Irwindale, its main stem is known as Santa Anita Creek, which extends to another northwards into the San Gabriel Mountains where the source, or headwaters, of the river are found.

==Background==
The Rio Hondo has sometimes been described as a second channel of the San Gabriel River. For much of its length, the rivers flow parallel to each other about two miles (3 km) apart. Both rivers pass through the Whittier Narrows, a natural gap in the hills which form the southern boundary of the San Gabriel Valley. Here, both rivers are impounded by the Whittier Narrows Dam, which the Army Corps of Engineers describes as, &quot;the central element of the Los Angeles County Drainage Area (LACDA) flood control system&quot;. During major storms, the outlet works at Whittier Narrows Dam can direct water to either channel, or runoff can be stored.

The Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River have both been part of a revitalization program called the Emerald Necklace. The goal of this program is to create a &quot;necklace&quot; of parks and reclaimed wild spaces with the two rivers. They are connected by a narrow strip in Irwindale and by Whittier Narrows to give them the appearance of a necklace if viewed from above. The project garnered broad support from organizations such as the Sierra Club along with the governments of the many cities the rivers pass through.

Most of the Rio Hondo is a concrete-lined channel to serve its primary flood control function, but in two places the river flows over open ground: the Peck Road Water Conservation Park, and the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. Large spreading grounds for water conservation surround much of the river, and its bike paths are very popular.

The river passes through the location of the Battle of Rio San Gabriel, fought on January 8, 1847, and which resulted in a U.S. victory. Although the battle was actually fought on the west bank of the present-day Rio Hondo near where it is crossed by Washington Boulevard, the battle is named after the San Gabriel, which at that time flowed along these banks. A flood in 1867 caused the San Gabriel to change course, which it retains at present. The old San Gabriel was renamed the Rio Hondo after this flood. In Downey, California, the Rio Hondo was once known as the &quot;Old River&quot;, because it was the old course of the San Gabriel River. The Old River School was named for it, and Old River School Road was named for the school. The &quot;New River&quot; is the present course of the San Gabriel River.

==Legacy==
The Rio Hondo College and Rio Hondo Preparatory School were named after the river.

In what is now the Bosque del Rio Hondo Natural Area, Marrano Beach was born on the riverfront property of El Rancho de Don Daniel, a Mexican land grant from the nineteenth century that had belonged the Repetto-Alvarado family, a prominent family of California land owners. El Rancho de Don Daniel encompassed riparian wetlands and ponds surrounding the Rio Hondo, which flowed year-round, and the seasonal Mission Creek. With few opportunities for respite after toiling in the fields, Mexican-American residents of the local barrios cultivated recreational lifestyles around this section of the river and embraced it as a bucolic resource for community and family activities.

==Parks and recreation==

The Rio Hondo River Trail is a multi-use trail that runs parallel to Rio Hondo through the San Gabriel Valley. The northern end starts along the reservoir at the Peck Road Water Conservation Park and continues along the channel to Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. The trail is 15.6 miles long. Allowed uses include hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding and walking dogs on leash. There is also bird and wildlife watching.

<doc id="756544" wikidata="Q887753" url="?curid=756544" title="Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat">
<text>Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat (; 23 January 1942 – 17 January 2025) was a Mongolian politician and a member of the Constitutional Court of Mongolia. He served as a president of Mongolia from 1990 to 1997 first as Chairman of the Presidium of the People&#x27;s Great Khural in 1990 then, as the President of Mongolia from 1990 to 1997. He was the first President of Mongolia to be elected by direct popular vote.

==Early life and career==
Ochirbat was born on 23 January 1942 in Tüdevtei district, Zavkhan Province. His father is from Govi-Altai Province. He adopted his mother&#x27;s name &quot;Punsalmaa&quot; after his father died in 1947. From 1951 to 1960, he attended school in Ulaanbaatar and then studied at the Leningrad Higher School of Mining, graduating in 1965 with a degree in mining engineering. That same year he returned to Ulaanbaatar and joined the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party.

In 1967, Ochirbat was named Chief Engineer at the Sharyn Gol coal mine in Darkhan-Uul Province before becoming deputy Minister of Mining and Geology in 1972. In 1976, he became a deputy in the People&#x27;s Great Khural, a member of the MPRP Central Committee, and was concurrently promoted to full Minister of Mining and Geology. In 1985, he was appointed Chairman of the State Commission for Foreign Economic Relations and then became Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Supplies when the commission was elevated to ministry status in 1987.
===1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia===
Ochirbat was named Chairman of the Presidium (titular head of state) of the People&#x27;s Great Khural on 21 March 1990 following the resignation of Jambyn Batmönkh and other government leaders in the wake of the 1990 Democratic Revolution. He was re-elected to the People&#x27;s Great Khural in July 1990 parliamentary elections and then chosen by Khural members for the newly created position of President of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. The new Constitution of 1992 changed the official name of the country to Mongolia and Ochirbat&#x27;s official title to &quot;President of Mongolia and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces&quot;. The new constitution also set new presidential elections, the first to be decided by direct popular vote, for the following year, 1993.

==Presidential term==
Although Ochirbat strongly advocated policies of rapid national revitalisation and economic reform to break the country from its socialist past and adopt capitalism by the year 2000, he had a reputation for flexibility and willingness to compromise and his persuasiveness helped diffuse confrontations and political crises in the lead up to the first free elections in June 1993. Nevertheless, ideological splits within the MPRP lead the party leadership to reject Ochirbat as their presidential candidate and instead nominate hardliner Lodongiin Tüdev, editor in chief of the communist newspaper &quot;Ünen&quot;. Sensing an opportunity, a coalition of opposition parties, including the National Democrats and Social Democratic party, nominated Ochirbat as their candidate. On June 6, 1993, Ochirbat soundly defeated Tudev, winning 57.8 percent of the vote to become the first president ever elected by popular vote in Mongolia.

Ochirbat&#x27;s term in office was beset by a series of political and economic crises. By the end of 1993, Ochirbat had become a harsh critic of government&#x27;s failure to address the country&#x27;s worsening economic situation. The country suffered food and energy shortages and high inflation. Ochirbat accused the government of not meeting its social welfare obligations. He was also critical of the Mongolian Intelligence services for failing to prevent the rise of transnational organised crime in Mongolia. He blamed over burdensome local and central bureaucracies for blocking faster economic improvement and called for reducing the overall size of the bureaucracy and speeding up privatization of government owned assets. By 1995 only 19.2% of economy had been privatised.

When in March 1994 opposition parties withdrew from parliament, Ochirbat publicly called for a protection of the rights of the minority parties and accused the ruling MPRP of exploiting the media to their advantage by limiting press coverage of parliament. He also supported reforms to election law to open elections to all parties in advance of parliamentary elections in 1996. In 1994, he vetoed a parliamentary decree to promote Cyrillic script in Mongolia and delay introduction of classical script.

In foreign affairs, Ochirbat called for a re-orientation of Mongolian foreign policy to broaden international cooperation with all nations, especially with Mongolia&#x27;s two powerful neighbours China and Russia. He rejected the transport and stationing of weapons of mass destruction in Mongolia, and declared Mongolia a nuclear free zone. In 1994, Ochirbat undertook official visits to South and Southeast Asia, signed cooperation agreements with India and Laos, and obtained financial assistance from Thailand to address the food shortage crisis. Ochirbat was the first Mongolian leader ever to officially visit the United States as well as the first Mongolian head of state in 30 years to visit Beijing, although relations with China suffered in autumn of 1995 when workers at the Mongolian embassy in Beijing discovered electronic bugs that had presumably been in place more than 10 years. 
===1997 presidential election===
Ochirbat again ran for president in the May 1997 election, but faced a Mongolian public unhappy with the economic dislocation caused by the fast pace of reforms. The country was racked by high unemployment, 30 percent inflation, widespread shortages of foodstuffs and energy supplies and a falling GDP. According to the World Bank, one third of population was living in poverty. Winning only 29 percent of the vote, Ochirbat lost the election to the chairman of the MPRP Natsagiin Bagabandi who had pledged to try to slow down the Government&#x27;s radical reforms.

==After politics==
After the election, Ochirbat left Mongolian politics and founded the &quot;Ochirbat Foundation&quot;, a non-profit, non Governmental organisation that focused on poverty alleviation and self-sufficiency, environmental, and education programs. In 2000 he became Director of the Center for Ecology and Sustainable Development at Mongolian University of Science and Technology. In 2005 he was appointed Member of the Constitutional Court of Mongolia and re-appointed in 2010.

==Personal life and death==
Ochirbat was married to Sharav Tsevelmaa and had two children.

Ochirbat died on 17 January 2025, at the age of 82. Following his death, Mongolia’s current President, Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, issued a decree declaring a period of national mourning from January 24 to January 25, 2025.

==Awards==
Ochirbat was the recipient of several awards and medals, including; Order of Chinggis Khan, Order of the Polar Star, Honoured medal of labour, Medal of the 50th, 60th, 80th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Revolution, Medal of Military Force, Medal of the 800th Anniversary of the foundation of the Great Mongolian State, and Medal of the 20th Anniversary of the Democratic Revolution.

<text>Paul Theodore Davenport, (born December 24, 1946) was the tenth president of the University of Alberta and ninth president of the University of Western Ontario.

Born and raised in Summit, New Jersey, he graduated magna cum laude from Stanford University in 1969 with a BA in economics. He moved to Canada and earned an MA and Ph.D in economics from the University of Toronto.

From 1973 until 1989, he taught economics at McGill University and from 1986 to 1989, he was Vice Principal for Planning &amp; Computer Services. He served as president of the University of Alberta from 1989 until 1994, and became president of the University of Western Ontario on July 1, 1994. Davenport&#x27;s tenure as President of the University of Alberta was tumultuous. Several years into his term, during a period of tight provincial budgets, he sought to close the Faculty of Dentistry and drop the Football program. These controversial proposals proved unpopular and brought resistance on many fronts, including that of the university&#x27;s Board of Governors, and he was not offered a second term.

He has honorary degrees from the University of Alberta (1994), the University of Toronto (2000), and the International University of Moscow (2002). He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2001, one of only a few foreigners to be awarded this honour. He was also named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2002. Among UWO students, especially the student newspaper The Gazette, he was often referred to as &quot;the French knight.&quot;

He is a member of the economics department at UWO and continues to supervise theses and publish articles. His term ended 2009, making him only the third president of Western to serve longer than ten years. He was succeeded by Amit Chakma.

Davenport is the chair of the board of governors of the University of Rwanda, and is also a member of Rwandan president Paul Kagame&#x27;s Presidential Advisory Council.

<text>The pi Puppids are a meteor shower associated with the comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup. The meteoroid streams approach the Sun at around 37 km/s and have to overtake Earth that is orbiting the Sun at 30 km/s, resulting in atmospheric entry at a relatively slow 15 km/s.

The meteor stream is viewable around April 24 but only in years around the parent comet&#x27;s perihelion date, the next being in 2023. However, in 1999 the planet Jupiter perturbed the comet&#x27;s perihelion to beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit, and it is uncertain how strong the shower will be in the future.

The pi Puppids get their name because their radiant appears to lie in the constellation Puppis, at around right ascension 112 degrees and declination −45 degrees. This made them only visible to southern observers.

They were discovered in 1972 and have been observed about every 5 years - at each perihelion passage of the comet - but often at very low rates per hour.

== 2019 ==
With a large error bar, the Pi Puppids may have briefly reached a Zenithal hourly rate of around 380 on 17 April 2019. Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup had come to perihelion in October 2018.

<text>Struga ( ; , ) is a town and popular tourist destination situated in the south-western region of North Macedonia, lying on the shore of Lake Ohrid. The town of Struga is the seat of Struga Municipality.

==Name==

The name Struga was first mentioned in the 11th century. It is of Slavic origin. and means a &quot;river bed&quot;.

The ancient name of the city is Enchalon (Εγχαλών), the ancient Greek word for eel, which may be related to the Illyrian Enchele tribe that was known to live in the region. According to E. Hamp, a connection with Albanian ’ngjalë’ makes it possible that the name Enchele was derived from the Illyrian term for eels, which may have been anciently related to Greek and simply adjusted to the Greek pronunciation. In Polybius the word &#x27;Enchele&#x27; is written with a voiceless aspirate &quot;kh&quot;, &quot;Enchelanes&quot;, while in Mnaseas it was replaced with a voiced &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;Engelanes&quot;, the latter being a typical feature of the Ancient Macedonian and northern Paleo-Balkan languages.

==History==
In ancient times, the Lake Ohrid region, including Enchalon (ancient name of modern Struga) was inhabited by the Illyrian Enchele and Dassareti tribes. The Via Egnatia ran through the Lake Ohrid region, and is believed to have passed west of Enchalon.

Etymologist Qemal Murati believes that the name Strugë-a was first used as the name of a village; this name was used in a document of Tsar Dusan in the 14th century in the form of Struga. Later, in the 16th-17th centuries, the Codex of Slepçan, the name &#x27;Strugi&#x27; was used.

In the 16th century the city was visited by the Venetian Ambassador Lorenzo Bernardo who described it as a city in Bulgaria which was more akin to a small village. He describes the town as an important destination for wheat shipments and a town with fertile plains and valleys, and he speaks highly of the local eel and trout.

Struga was visited by Henry Fanshawe Tozer in his travels in the Ottoman Empire, who spoke highly of the region and the Ohrid Lake which he compared to Italian lakes and to Biblical sites such as the Sea of Galilee, he considered Struga to be a head-quarters of fishery in European Turkey and that the fishery in Struga was property of the Ottoman Sultan who sublet it to locals for a large sum, he spoke highly of the endemic Ohrid trout. According to him the marshes in the region were turned into a habitable region by the Samuel of Bulgaria at the time when he made the city of Ohrid Bulgarian capital. He visited a large local Bulgarian school and mentioned the admiration that the Byzantine princess Anna Comnena had for the hundred of channels, embankments and watercourses in the city.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Struga was part of the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

Struga is the home-city of the Miladinov brothers poets who played a crucial part in the Bulgarian national revival and in whose honor the Struga Poetry Evenings are held in the city. Struga was also the birthplace for a number of IMARO revolutionaries such as Hristo Matov.

Struga was the birthplace in 1865 Ibrahim Temo, who would go on to be a doctor and one of the founders of the Ottoman reform movement known as the Committee of Union and Progress.

Struga was part of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia since 1945 as part of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia until the 1991 Macedonian independence referendum when Macedonia peacefully seceded from the federation.

==Geography==
Struga is located in an open valley on Lake Ohrid. The Black Drin river (Crn Drim) starts at the lake and divides the city.

==Demographics==
During the 16th century, Struga was located in the Sanjak of Ohrid of the Ottoman Empire. It was registered as a Christian village in the Nahiya of Ohrid with 184 Christian families, 20 unmarried men and 36 widows, as well as 8 Muslim families.

In statistics gathered by Vasil Kanchov in 1900, Struga was inhabited by 4570 people, of whom 3000 Christian Bulgarians, 1000 Turks, 350 Muslim Albanians and 220 Romanis&#x27;. The Bulgarian researcher Vasil Kanchov wrote in 1900 that many Albanians declared themselves as Turks. In Struga, the population that declared itself Turkish &quot;was of Albanian blood&quot;, but it &quot;had been Turkified after the Ottoman invasion, including Skanderbeg&quot;, referring to Islamization. Jordan Ivanov, professor at the University of Sofia, wrote in 1915 that Albanians, since they did not have their own alphabet, due to a lack of consolidated national consciousness and influenced by foreign propaganda, declared themselves as Turks, Greeks and Bulgarians, depending on which religion they belonged to. Albanians were losing their mother tongue in Struga.

According to the 1943 Albanian census, Struga was inhabited by 2,876 Orthodox Macedonians, 2,063 Muslim Albanians, 443 Aromanians, 14 Serbs and 10 Russians.

As of the 2002 census, the city of Struga has 16,559 inhabitants and the ethnic composition was the following:

*Macedonians, 8,901 (53.7%)
*Albanians, 5,293 (32.0%)
*Turks, 907 (5.5%)
*Vlachs, 550 (3.3%)
*others, 908 (5.5%)

The mother tongues of the city&#x27;s residents were the following:
*Macedonian, 9,665 (58.4%)
*Albanian, 5,615 (34.0%)
*Turkish, 823 (5.0%)
*Aromanian, 271 (1.6%)
*others, 185 (1.1%)

The Gheg and Tosk dialects of Albanian are both spoken by the Albanians in Struga, and speakers are divided in the settlement by the Black Drin. The Albanian dialects in Struga are somewhere between Central Gheg and Northern Tosk, and they do not have many distinguishing features between them. The differences between them lie mainly in phonetics and morphology, with very few differences in terms of lexicology. Also, the Tosk spoken language and the town one - which is a transitive spoken language - do not have many differences from today&#x27;s contemporary language.

The religious composition of the city was the following:
*Orthodox Christians, 9,197 (55.5%)
*Muslims, 7,075 (42.7%)
*others, 287 (1.7%)
*PWDTFAS-Persons for whom data are taken from administrative sources
Until the last few decades of the 20th century Albanian Tosk, in particular the geographically central variety of the dialect dominated among speakers of Albanian in Struga. The local Romani population of Struga speaks and sings in the southern Tosk Albanian dialect, as does the local Turkish population.

==Culture==
Struga is also a place of important cultural significance in North Macedonia, as it is the birthplace of the poets Konstantin and Dimitar Miladinov.

The main event of the cultural life in Struga is the world&#x27;s largest poetry gathering, Struga Poetry Evenings, whose laureates have included several Nobel Prize for Literature winners such as
* Joseph Brodsky,
* Eugenio Montale,
* Pablo Neruda,
* Seamus Heaney,
* Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca
and many others since 1966.

There are several cultural monuments in Struga and in its vicinity such as
* the Monastery of Kališta, a few kilometers away from the town center, lying on the shore of Lake Ohrid. It is believed that it dates from the 16th century, with frescoes from the 14th and the 15th centuries.
* Another rock church is present in the neighbouring village of Radožda with frescoes from the 13th and 14th centuries.
* The Church of Sveta Bogorodica (St Mary) in Vraništa, is believed to be where Tsar Samuel was crowned. 
* The church of St. George is also located in the town; built on top of Samuel&#x27;s church, it has many icons from the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries.
* Near the village of Radolishta, a basilica from the 4th century was discovered, with a mosaic.

Struga&#x27;s old architecture dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. 

==Sports==
Local football clubs FC Struga and FK Karaorman have both played in the Macedonian First Football League. A third club Vllaznimi, currently plays in the Macedonian Third League (Southwest Division).

==Economy==
===Tourism===

Much of the town&#x27;s income is through internal tourism. Struga&#x27;s location on Lake Ohrid makes it a slightly quieter and more peaceful experience than the more bustling Ohrid.

When visiting this quiet town of North Macedonia, there are a few other places that show the beauty and culture, like the clay chamber pots at the house of the Miladinovci Brothers, the old bazaar, the century-old churches and mosques.

Before the evenings you can enjoy on 3 kinds of beaches called &quot;Male beach&quot; (maška plaža), &quot;Female beach&quot; (Ženska plaža) and Galeb (&quot;Gull Beach&quot;), located just before the estuary of the river Crn Drim (Black Drim) in its own flow, and between the two previous beaches.

Just in front of the &quot;Male beach&quot;, at the estuary of the river Crn Drim it is located the biggest 5 star Hotel Drim in Struga.

Out of the town there is another tourist place near the lake called Biser (Pearl), also a hotel.

Every August the Struga Poetry Evenings (SPE) are held at the &quot;Poetry Bridge&quot; () and are attended by poets, writers and artists from across the world.

<doc id="756571" wikidata="Q5252430" url="?curid=756571" title="Rowlf the Dog">
<text>Rowlf the Dog is a Muppet character created and originally performed by Jim Henson. Known most notably as the resident pianist on the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Rowlf is an anthropomorphic scruffy brown dog of indeterminate breed with a rounded black nose and long floppy ears. Laid-back and wisecracking, his humor is characterized as deadpan and as such, he is one of few Muppets who is rarely flustered by the show&#x27;s prevalent mayhem. Henson&#x27;s closest collaborators and family members have claimed Rowlf to be the Muppet character most similar to Henson&#x27;s real-life personality.

Rowlf was created in 1962 being introduced as the spokesman of Purina Dog Chow television commercials aired in Canada, in which he appeared with Baskerville the Hound. Rowlf was designed and performed by Henson, and was built by Don Sahlin; it was Sahlin&#x27;s first Muppet construction. Rowlf subsequently appeared on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot; from 1963 to 1966, becoming the first Muppet to appear regularly on network television. In the 1970s and 1980s, Rowlf appeared as a regular character on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1982), as well as in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984). After a brief hiatus following Henson&#x27;s death, Rowlf returned to the forefront in Muppet films and television series with Bill Barretta performing the character since &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996).

==Career==
===&quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;===
Rowlf rose to popularity as Jimmy Dean&#x27;s sidekick on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;, performed by Henson with Frank Oz assisting. He was the first Muppet with a regular spot on network television, appearing in 85 of the 86 total episodes from 1963 to the show&#x27;s end in 1966. Jimmy Dean stated that Rowlf&#x27;s segments were one of the most popular parts of the show, and that Rowlf drew two thousand fan letters a week. Henson was so grateful for the exposure Dean offered on his show, even proposing that he take a 40% stake in Henson&#x27;s company. Dean refused, however, later saying in 2005, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything to earn that.&quot; Dean and Rowlf appeared together for the last time in an episode of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; airing on October 8, 1967, performing &quot;Friendship&quot; while doing the &quot;herd of cows&quot; gag.

===&quot;Sesame Street&quot;===
In 1968, Rowlf appeared with Kermit the Frog on the pitch reel for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. At the end of the pitch reel, Rowlf is depicted as being eager to join the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; cast, while Kermit seems reluctant to do so; however, it was Kermit who became a &quot;Sesame&quot; star, while Rowlf appeared only in one filmed segment and was never a part of the show&#x27;s regular cast.

===&quot;The Muppets&quot;===
In 1976, Rowlf joined the recurring cast of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; as the show&#x27;s pianist. Rowlf also played Dr. Bob, the wisecracking doctor in the recurring medical drama parody skit &quot;Veterinarian&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, alongside nurses Janice and Miss Piggy. Though considered one of the main characters, he rarely interacted with any of the backstage plots involving the show&#x27;s weekly guest stars.

Rowlf has a primary role in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979). In 1984, Baby Rowlf debuted playing a toy piano during a musical number in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;. This fantasy sequence with the Muppets as babies was so popular that it resulted in the successful animated cartoon spinoff &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. He was voiced on that program by Katie Leigh.

Jim Henson&#x27;s last public performance as Rowlf before his death was as guest on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in 1989. For several years afterward, the character was retired out of deference to Henson&#x27;s memory (only returning for silent cameos in &quot;The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;), as he was both the first Muppet to achieve popularity and, according to some sources, the character closest to Jim Henson&#x27;s personality, with Henson&#x27;s son Brian saying in the introduction to episode 117 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;: &quot;Kermit was my father&#x27;s best known character, but a lot of people think he was more like Rowlf in real life except he couldn&#x27;t play the piano as well.&quot;

Since 1996, Rowlf has been portrayed by puppeteer Bill Barretta. Barretta has gradually transitioned into the role. Rowlf&#x27;s first words since Henson&#x27;s death were in the second episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;. Rowlf also had several lines of dialogue in &quot;The Muppet Show Live&quot; (2001) and spoke two lines of dialogue (&quot;Hey, Kermit!&quot; and &quot;Yeah! Heh, heh. Oh!&quot;) in &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; (2002). In 2005, Rowlf had a 190-word monologue in the second episode of &quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot;. Rowlf appeared in the &quot;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot; music video for rock band Weezer. Although he&#x27;s only briefly seen, Rowlf had a more prominent role in the behind-the-scenes making-of special that accompanied it, &quot;Weezer and the Muppets Go Fishin&quot;&#x27;.

Additionally, Bill Barretta recorded the vocals as Rowlf singing &quot;The Christmas Party Sing-Along&quot; for the 2006 &quot;The Muppets: A Green and Red Christmas&quot; album.

Rowlf and Kermit appeared together at the 2011 Disney D23 Expo to honor Jim Henson&#x27;s posthumous induction as a Disney Legend, singing a live duet of &quot;The Rainbow Connection&quot;, as they were Henson&#x27;s first two Muppet characters.

Rowlf appears in &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011), initially saddened he wasn&#x27;t included in the montage depicting the principal Muppets being reunited (Rowlf was asleep, and was simply woken up by Kermit and easily convinced to join the cause), and helps rebuild the Muppet theater. He also performs &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; in a barbershop quartet with Sam the Eagle, Beaker, and Link Hogthrob during the Muppet Telethon, as well as an unwilling (and captive) Jack Black.

As of 2014, Rowlf is on long-term display at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 2019, Rowlf appeared with Darci Lynne on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent: The Champions&quot;, singing &quot;Can&#x27;t Smile Without You&quot;.

<text>Max J. Rosenberg (September 13, 1914 – June 14, 2004) was an American film distributor and producer, whose career spanned six decades. He was particularly known for his horror or supernatural films, and found much of his success while working in England.

==Life and career==
Rosenberg was born in The Bronx, New York City, to a family of Jewish immigrants. In 1945, he entered the film business by becoming a film distributor, using the business names Classic Pictures Inc. and, occasionally, National Roadshows. As such, he first distributed mainly reissues, but by 1950 was adding a range of film types (from Murder in the Cathedral to Chained For Life). 

He entered production with the film &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot; (1956), a rock-and-roll story. His partner in the production of this film was Milton Subotsky. Subsequently, he and Subotsky emigrated to England, where they founded the British company Amicus Productions in 1962. With Amicus, he primarily produced horror or supernatural films, such as Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors in 1965, the title of which he had originally used for a National Roadshows film of 1945. 

Over the course of his career, Rosenberg produced more than 50 films, although his work was not always credited. Among the other horror and supernatural films he produced were such titles as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972), &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot; (1974), and its sequel, &quot;The People That Time Forgot&quot; (1977).

Rosenberg also produced a children&#x27;s film, &quot;Lad, a Dog&quot; (1962), director Richard Lester&#x27;s first film, &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; (1962), and two films based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; British science-fiction television series: &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966). He was particularly proud to have produced the 1968 film of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, starring Robert Shaw and directed by William Friedkin. Rosenberg continued to work well into his 80s; his final film credit was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Perdita Durango&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Dance with the Devil&quot;).

Rosenberg died in Los Angeles, California in 2004, at the age of 89.

<doc id="756593" wikidata="Q2994643" url="?curid=756593" title="Windows Console">
<text>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the key combination. The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.

Windows Console instances are typically used for apps that do not need to display images but might use color. Examples include cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, Far Manager, and Midnight Commander.

In 2019, the console host was open-sourced under the MIT License, alongside Windows Terminal.

==Window and full screen modes==
In Windows, a console application may run in two modes.

One mode places the text in a window and uses an operating system&#x27;s font rendering. In this mode, an application&#x27;s interaction with user is controlled by the windowing system. This is analogous to X Window System applications such as xterm.

The second is the full-screen mode. In Windows XP and earlier, the full-screen console uses a hardware text mode and uploads a raster font to the video adapter. This is analogous to a text system console. This early full-screen mode only supports VGA-compatible text modes, giving it a maximum character resolution of 80 columns by 28 rows. This mode was deprecated in Windows Vista. It was possible to circumvent this issue by installing a Windows XP display driver; however, Windows 8 and later do not accept them. Windows 10 features a full-screen mode once again, but this implementation uses the native Windows rendering subsystem, instead of the text mode. It can have as many columns and rows as fits on the screen.

Apps can be made to switch between the two modes using the key combination.

==Details==
The input buffer is a queue where events are stored (from keyboard, mouse etc.). The output buffer is a rectangular grid where characters are stored, together with their attributes. A console window may have several output buffers, only one of which is active (i.e. displayed) for a given moment. Apps may programmatically interact with Windows Console through Windows API, which exposes both high-level functions (such as codice_1 and codice_2) and low-level functions (e.g. codice_3 and codice_4). 

Users can change the color palette or font, either on the system-wide level or app-level. Each instance of a console app themselves, however, cannot change its color palette or font on the fly.

Windows Console apps are distinct from MS-DOS apps, even though on Windows (especially on Windows 9x), they may not look different. Windows Console apps have access to entire Windows API and do not run on MS-DOS or compatible operating systems. DOS apps, however, cannot access Windows API and may only run on 32-bit versions of Windows with the aid of Virtual DOS machine (VDM).

==Implementations==
In Windows 3.1 and earlier, there is no native support for consoles. Because those version are merely a graphical interface for MS-DOS, most text programs that ran on earlier Windows versions were actually MS-DOS programs running in a window. To simplify the task of porting applications to Windows, early versions of Visual C++ are supplied with QuickWin, a library that implements basic console functionality inside a regular window. A similar library for Borland C++ was called EasyWin.

===Windows 9x===

Windows 9x support is relatively poor compared to Windows NT, because the console window runs in the system virtual DOS machine and so keyboard input to a Win32 console application had to be directed to it by conagent.exe running in a DOS VM that are also used for real DOS applications by hooking the keyboard interrupt. codice_5 then calls Vcond (which is a VxD). Vcond then had to pass the keyboard input to the System VM, and then finally to the Win32 console application. Besides performance, another problem with this implementation is that drives that are local to a DOS VM are not visible to a Win32 console application. This can cause confusion.

Under Windows 9x, the screen buffer mirrors the structure of VGA text buffer, with two bytes per character cell: one byte for character code, one byte for attributes (the character must be in OEM character set, the attribute is with high-intensity background/no blinking). This speeds up operation considerably if the actual VGA text mode is used.

===Windows NT and Windows CE===
Traditionally, the Client/Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) has been responsible for managing console windows on the Windows NT family of operating systems. In Windows 7, CSRSS spawns one codice_6 for each console window, to manage it. In Windows 8 and later, the console apps spawn their codice_6 processes directly. This change has both security and usability implications. While CSRSS runs in a highly privileged security context, each codice_6 runs in the same security context as the console app. In addition, in Windows 7, this change enabled console windows to have the features of the Aero Glass theme.

On Windows NT and Windows CE, the screen buffer uses four bytes per character cell: two bytes for character code, two bytes for attributes. The character is then encoded in a 16-bit subset of Unicode (UCS-2). For backward compatibility, the console APIs exist in two versions: Unicode and non-Unicode. The non-Unicode versions of APIs can use code page switching to extend the range of displayed characters (but only if TrueType fonts are used for the console window, thereby extending the range of codes available). Even UTF-8 is available as &quot;code page 65001&quot; (displaying only from the UCS-2 subset of full Unicode).

As of the Windows 10 October 2018 update, the Windows Console has full Unicode support.

<text>Haim Yosef David Azulai ben Yitzhak Zerachia (1724 – 1 March 1806) (), commonly known as the Hida (also spelled Chida, the acronym of his name, ), was a Jerusalem born rabbinical scholar, a noted bibliophile, and a pioneer in the publication of Jewish religious writings. He is considered &quot;one of the most prominent Sephardi rabbis of the 18th century&quot;.

Azulai embarked on two extensive fundraising missions for the Jewish community in Hebron. His first journey, spanning 1753–1757, crossed Italy and German lands, reaching Western Europe and London. A second trip, between 1772–1778, saw him travel through Tunisia, Italy, France, and Holland. Following his travels, Azulai settled in the Italian port city of Livorno, a major center of Sephardic Jewish life. He remained there until his death in 1806.

The Hida&#x27;s intact and published travel diaries, similarly to those of Benjamin of Tudela, provide a comprehensive first hand account of Jewish life and historical events throughout the Europe and Near East of his day.

Some have speculated that his family name, Azulai, is an acronym based on being a Kohen: (&quot;Leviticus&quot;, 21:7), a biblical restriction on whom a Kohen may marry.

== Biography ==
Azulai was born in Jerusalem, where he received his education from some local prominent scholars. He was the scion of a prominent rabbinic family, the great-great-grandson of Moroccan Rabbi Abraham Azulai. The Yosef part of his name came from his mother&#x27;s father, Rabbi Yosef Bialer, a German scholar.

His main teachers were the Yishuv haYashan rabbis Isaac HaKohen Rapoport, Shalom Sharabi, and Haim ibn Attar (the &quot;Ohr HaHaim&quot;) as well as Jonah Nabon. At an early age he showed proficiency in Talmud, Kabbalah, and Jewish history, and &quot;by the age of 12 he was already composing chiddushim on Hilchos Melichah.&quot;

In 1755, he was—on the basis of his scholarship—elected to become an emissary (&quot;shaliach&quot;) for the small Jewish community in the Land of Israel, and he would travel around Europe extensively, making an impression in every Jewish community that he visited. According to some records, he left the Land of Israel three times (1755, 1770, and 1781), living in Hebron in the meantime. His travels took him to Western Europe, and North Africa. 

In 1755 he was in Germany, where he met the Pnei Yehoshua,
 who on the basis of prior written communication confirmed Hida&#x27;s identity. In 1764 he was in Egypt, and in 1773 he was in Tunisia, Morocco, and Italy. He seems to have remained in the latter country until 1777, most probably occupied with the printing of the first part of his biographical dictionary, &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot;, (Livorno, 1774), and with his notes on the &quot;Shulhan Aruch,&quot; entitled &quot;Birke Yosef&quot;, (Livorno, 1774–76). In 1777 he was in France, and in 1778 in Holland. Wherever he went, he would examine collections of manuscripts of rabbinic literature, which he later documented in his &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot;.

On 28 October 1778 he married, in Pisa, his second wife, Rachel; his first wife, also Rachel, had died in 1773. Noting this event in his diary, he adds the wish that he may be permitted to return to the Land of Israel. This wish seems not to have been realized. In any event, he remained in Leghorn (Livorno), occupied with the publication of his works, and died there twenty-eight years later in 1806 (Friday night, 11 Adar 5566, Shabbat Zachor). He had been married twice; he had two sons by the names of Abraham and Raphael Isaiah Azulai.

===Reburial in Israel===
In 1956, the 150th anniversary of Hida&#x27;s death, Israel&#x27;s Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Nissim 
began work on a plan to reinter Hida in Israel. This included getting the approval and cooperation of the Leghorn Jewish community, acquiring a special 600 square meter plot on Har Hamenuchot, and constructing an ohel over the grave. On Tuesday, 20 Iyar 5720 (17 May 1960), 154 years after his Petira, Hida&#x27;s final written wish, to return to Israel, &quot;came true.&quot;

== His early scholarship ==
While being a strict Talmudist, and a believer in the Kabbalah, his studious habits and exceptional memory awakened in him an interest in the history of rabbinical literature.

He accordingly began at an early age a compilation of passages in rabbinical literature in which dialectic authors had tried to solve questions that were based on chronological errors. This compilation, which he completed at age 16, he called העלם דבר (&quot;Some Oversights&quot;); it was never printed.

Azulai&#x27;s scholarship made him so famous that in 1755 he was chosen as &quot;meshulach&quot;, (emissary), an honor bestowed on such men only as were, by their learning, well fitted to represent the Holy Land in Europe, where the people looked upon a rabbi from the land of Israel as a model of learning and piety.

Azulai&#x27;s literary activity is of an astonishing breadth. It encompasses every area of rabbinic literature: exegesis, homiletics, casuistry, Kabbalah, liturgics, and literary history. A voracious reader, he noted all historical references; and on his travels he visited the famous libraries of Italy and France, where he examined the Hebrew manuscripts.

== His works ==
Azulai was a prolific writer. His works range from a prayerbook he edited and arranged (&#x27;Tefillat Yesharim&#x27;) to a vast spectrum of Halachic literature including a commentary on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; titled &#x27;Birkei Yosef&#x27; which appears in most editions. While living and traveling in Italy, he printed many works, mainly in Livorno and Pisa but also in Mantua. The list of his works, compiled by Isaac ben Jacob, runs to seventy-one items; but some are named twice, because they have two titles, and some are only small treatises. The veneration bestowed upon him by his contemporaries was that given to a saint. He reports in his diary that when he learned in Tunis of the death of his first wife, he kept it secret, because the people would have forced him to marry at once. Legends printed in the appendix to his diary, and others found in Aaron Walden&#x27;s &quot;Shem HaGedolim HeḤadash&quot; (compare also &quot;Ma&#x27;aseh Nora&quot;, pp. 7–16, Podgorica, 1899), prove the great respect in which he was held. Many of his works are still extant and studied today. His scope was exceptionally wide, from &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;Birkei Yosef&quot;) and &quot;Midrash&quot; to his main historical work &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot;. Despite his Sephardi heritage, he appears to have been particularly fond of the &quot;Chasidei Ashkenaz&quot; (a group of Medieval German rabbis, notably Judah the Chasid).

=== &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot; ===
His historical notes were published in four booklets, comprising two sections, under the titles &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot; (The Name of the Great Ones), containing the names of authors, and &quot;Va&#x27;ad la-Ḥakhamim&quot; (Assembly of the Wise), containing the titles of works. This treatise has established for Azulai a lasting place in Jewish literature. It contains data that might otherwise have been lost, and it proves the author to have had a critical mind. By sound scientific methods he investigated the question of the genuineness of Rashi&#x27;s commentary to &quot;Chronicles&quot; or to some Talmudic treatise (see &quot;Rashi,&quot; in &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot;). However, he does assert that Rashi indeed is the author of the &quot;Rashi&quot; commentary on Neviim and Ketuvim, contrary to some others&#x27; opinions.

Nevertheless, he firmly believed that Haim Vital had drunk water from Miriam&#x27;s well, and that this fact enabled him to receive, in less than two years, the whole Kabbalah from the lips of Isaac Luria (see &quot;Ḥayyim Vital,&quot; in &quot;Shem HaGedolim&quot;). Azulai often records where he has seen in person which versions of certain manuscripts were extant.

== His role as Shadar==
The Hida served the role of shadar (&quot;shaliach derabanan&quot;), or emissary, for the Jewish community of Hebron. He left Israel twice on five-year-long fundraising missions that took him as far west as Tunisia and as far north as Great Britain and Amsterdam. The Hida collected money on behalf of the Jewish communities in Israel who suffered from poverty and persecution.

The Hida, like many emissaries, was a qualified and highly regarded personality who was chosen to represent his community. A shadar often had to be able to arbitrate matters of Jewish law for the local Jewish communities Ideally, emissaries were multi-lingual so that they could communicate with both Jew and Gentile along the way. Emissaries had to be willing to undertake dangerous journeys mission that would separate them away from their families for so long. One in ten emissaries sent abroad for these fundraising missions never made it back alive. Emissaries would often divorce their wives before leaving, so that if they died along the way and their deaths could not be verified, their wives would be able to legally remarry. If they returned safely from their journey, they would remarry their wives, who would sometimes wait as long as five years for their husbands to return from their mission.

Moreover, the Hida records numerous instances of miraculous survival and dangerous threats of his day, among them, close scrapes with the Russian Navy during its support of the Ali Bey uprising against the Turks, the danger of boarding and worse by the Knights of Malta, the hostility of the English government officials towards anyone entering the country from France or Spain, as well as those aforementioned countries&#x27; wrath against someone crossing back over from their hated enemy, England, and the daily danger of running into various anti-semitic locals and nobles throughout mainland Europe (especially Germany).

=== Travelogue: Ma&#x27;gal Tov ===
Azulai authored a detailed travelogue recounting his two journeys to Europe. The travelogue documents Azulai&#x27;s encounters with various communities, rare books and manuscripts, and the challenges of overseas travel, including storms, pirates, custom officials, and occasional hostility from non-Jewish inkeepers. Likely intended for personal use, the travelogue was first printed in the 1930s by Aron Freimann based on the original autograph manuscript.

In his travelogue, Azulai also shows an interest in tourist attractions, visiting landmarks such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Boboli Gardens of Florence, the Palace of Versailles, and the Tower of London. He also climbed the Campanile in Venice for a panoramic view of the city and explored destinations like the new promenade in Nizza, an ancient temple in southern France, and the natural science museum in Amsterdam.

<text>Metsovo (; ) is a town in Epirus, in the mountains of Pindus in northern Greece, between Ioannina to the west and Meteora to the east.

The largest centre of Aromanian (Vlach) life in Greece, Metsovo is a large regional hub for several small villages and settlements in the Pindus region, and it features many shops, schools, offices, services, museums, and galleries. The economy of Metsovo is dominated by agriculture and tourism, the latter flourishing in winter.

Metsovo is served by Greek National Road 6 (Ioannina – Trikala) and by the A2 motorway.

==Etymology==
From medieval times till well into the 19th century, Metsovo was known, in various sources, as &quot;Metzovo&quot;. From the end of the 18th century on, the literary form of &quot;Messovon&quot; makes its appearance. The town is known as &quot;Aminciu&quot; in Aromanian (Vlach), and as &quot;Miçova&quot; in Ottoman Turkish.

===Ottoman census records===
In the Ottoman census records we see the word &quot;Mcwh&quot; (مجوه), which is usually pronounced &quot;Miçova&quot;. In Aromanian, Metsovo is called &quot;Aminʤu&quot;, a word combining the preposition &quot;a&quot;— meaning &quot;to, into&quot;—and the word &quot;Minʤu&quot;.

===Various names===
From &quot;Minʤu&quot; derive terms signifying ethnic origin &quot;Miʤanu&quot; and &quot;Miʤanə&quot;—meaning, respectively, &quot;man from Metsovo&quot;, &quot;woman from Metsovo&quot;—as well as the adjectives &quot;miʤənescu&quot; and &quot;miʤəneascə&quot;—meaning &quot;Metsovite&quot;, &quot;of Metsovo&quot;—which are used today by the residents of Metsovo. The Aromanian part of the population, that part which does not use the term &quot;Aminʤu&quot;, uses the name &quot;Meʤova&quot;. Some firman refer to Metsovo as Derveni.

===Modern form===

The derivation of the name &quot;Metsovo&quot;—from the words &quot;Mitsous&quot; and &quot;Mesovounon&quot; or from the unattested Slav word &quot;*Mẹčovo&quot;, meaning bear-place—which has been proposed by academics and historians, is not confirmed by linguistic research. Alternatively, there appears to be an etymological relation between the Aromanian &quot;Minʤu&quot; and the Greek &quot;Metsovo&quot;, the latter being a combination of the stem &quot;Mets&quot; and the Slavic-ending &quot;ovo&quot;.

==History==

In the 15th century Metsovo came under Ottoman rule and became part of the Sanjak of Ioannina. Throughout the late period of Ottoman rule (18th century-1913) the Greek and Aromanian population of the region (Northern Pindus) suffered from Albanian raiders. On one occasion, during the local Greek revolt of 1854, the town was plundered by both Ottoman troops and the men of Theodoros Grivas, a former general in the Greek military, during their struggle for control of the town. During the First Balkan War, Metsovo was burnt by raiding bands. In the last 10 days of October 1912, military volunteers from Crete, together with about 340 soldiers of the tactical Greek army under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mitsas, advanced through Thessaly to the then Greek-Turkish border along the mountains east of Metsovo. On October 31, 1912, the Greek troops assisted by rebel groups from Epirus and volunteers from Metsovo, having crossed the Katara-Zygos mountain ridge overnight, attacked the Turkish garrison of Metsovo, which then comprised 205 soldiers and two cannons. The battle lasted until 4 p.m. when the Ottoman soldiers inside the besieged Turkish garrison raised a white flag and surrendered.

===Social stratification===
Socially, the residents of Metsovo, up until the beginning of the 20th century, were divided into three classes: the &quot;arhontzi&quot; (arxondzɨ), the &quot;vinitsi&quot; (vinitsɨ) and the &quot;algi&quot; (alɟi) or, mockingly, &quot;gizari&quot; (ɟizari). This socioeconomic stratification developed during the Ottoman occupation.

====Árhontzi====

The arhontzi were the wealthiest part of society. Their revenues derived from wholesale and retail commercial activities. Although locally very powerful, they were not a closed group in terms of social mobility. Wealth gave anyone the right to climb up the social ladder to the next higher level, although such ascent often gave rise to serious conflicts.

====Vínitsi====
The vinitsi comprised the middle and lower classes of the settlement that were not occupied in livestock breeding. It mostly included farmers, small business owners, technicians, mule drivers, and small-scale merchants. Despite the economic and professional diversification among the vinitsi, they saw themselves as a unified social class, which was evident in their social relations. For example, they would marry among themselves but never with members of the algi.

====Álgi====
The algi were the class of traveling sheepherders, whose occupation was large-scale sheepherding, livestock breeding, as well as woodcarving. They had set rules regarding the social roles of their members, and a strict patriarchal structure that governed their class.

====Distinctions between vinitsi and algi====

The social differences between the two lower classes were not based on income criteria but on the fact that their members came from very different economic structures. In the past, the distinction between sheepherders and non-sheepherders existed in all developed Aromanian settlements of Pindos, and could possibly be concealing, in a latent form, the socioeconomic reality of past times. This was not a class distinction based on wealth, since in most cases the members of both groups belonged to the poorer segments of the population, but a differentiation related to the establishment of the settlements during the Ottoman period, which produced the co-existence of populations with the same linguistic base but with clearly different economic and social structures.

===Ottoman tax district===

Karye-iMiçova denoted the tax district of the Ottoman timar that constituted the area of Metsovo. Six settlements are recorded in it. Each settlement&#x27;s name is preceded by the indication &quot;karye&quot; and usually followed by the phrase &quot;tâbi&#x27;-iMiçova&quot; meaning &quot;subject to Metsovo&quot;.

The word &quot;karye&quot;, as a term in the organizational structure of the Ottoman Empire, defined a settlement or a group of settlements constituting a unified tax district. In the Greek language it is usually translated by the word &quot;chorion&quot;. However, it does not correspond to the term &quot;settlement&quot; as used in modern statistical terminology, but rather to &quot;community&quot;. In other words, it does not signify a group of buildings, but a well-defined geographical area with a self-contained legal entity. A karye could include more than one settlements regardless how far apart they were from each other.

In the 1506 census, Karye-iMiçova is followed by the phrase &quot;tâbi&#x27;-i Τirhala&quot; meaning &quot;subject to Trikala&quot;. The names of eight settlements appear in it. Before the name of each settlement, the indication &quot;karye&quot; of the 1454–55 census has been replaced by &quot;mahalle&quot;. The specific administrative structure of the area constituted the basis for its administrative organization in the centuries to come. In administrative documents of the 18th century, the present settlement of Metsovo is termed &quot;chora&quot; and the other villages as &quot;mahalades&quot;.

===The privileges of Metsovo===
Starting in the mid-17th century, the residents in the region of Metsovo were relieved from the obligation to pay the regular and ad hoc taxes that were usually paid by Christian residents in other Ottoman regions, on the condition that they would pay a lump sum per year. The Ottoman administration often made such arrangements for groups of its subjects that offered a special service to the state.

====The case of Metsovo====

The special service provided by the Metsovo residents was the guarding of the local mountain passes and the servicing of travelers. The special tax regime did not mean self-government in theory. The notion of autonomy was unknown to the Ottoman understanding of polity. In practice, however, the granting of tax exemptions was equivalent to self-governance of the area.

Since the 18th century, the management of &quot;lasa&quot;, or bequests left to a community, constituted one of the most important municipal functions. The love for their birthplace and the social altruism of the Metsovites living abroad resulted in the amassing of significant benefactor funds in Metsovo. As early as the beginning of the 19th century, there was a special logbook where the wills and testaments of the benefactors were recorded. The logbook was destroyed in 1854; it was then redrafted by the patriarchal exarchate of Metsovo but destroyed again in 1941.

====Management of state property====
In theory, the sultan was the undisputed owner of all land in Metsovo and had the right to dispose of it as he wished. That is why firmans were only temporarily applicable and defined the area as the property of Ottoman officials, to whom the Sultan granted tenure rights.

====Reduced taxes====

The reduction of taxes meant keeping a larger share of the local surplus crop production. In consequence, regardless of the theoretical framework that governed the land ownership and political regime of the Ottoman Empire, the lands of Metsovo were gradually falling under the absolute possession, ownership, and management of its residents, which corresponded to political self-governance. This development had a cost. Every year, the corresponding taxes and other contributions had to be pre-paid to the Ottoman landlord of the area, otherwise the Chora or Mukataa of Metsovo could lose its status and be combined with neighboring Ottoman regions.

====The phenomenon of beneficence====

Beneficence by Metsovites is a powerful phenomenon, the dimensions of which were formed through the processes relating to the socioeconomic growth of Metsovo during the Ottoman period. It is mainly the expression of the cultural notions that governed the ruling class of Metsovo at the time. Despite the long absence of the men of the community from Metsovo, due to their business and commercial activities, their hometown remains in their hearts as their financial and family seat. Consequently, a large part of their revenue is channeled into the local economy by themselves or their families, as charity or investment capital to be used for the conservation of the social and political superiority of their class.

Beneficence as a notion is directly connected with the special political regime granted by the Ottoman state to the Chora Metsovou. The demonstration of altruism, signaling and confirming their social distinction and status, provides Metsovites with the option to have social and economic control of their homeland. At first, their social solidarity is expressed as a church-sponsoring funding activity according to the standards of a cultural notion that derives from the medieval past of the Orthodox church.

===The Exarchate of Metsovo===

After 1659, the area of Metsovo, thus far under the bishopric of Stagoi, was formed into its own exarchate under a patriarchal exarch. The &quot;Catholic Exarch of Metsovo&quot;—a person appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople—resided in Constantinople and was paid 15 kuruşlar annually for his role as supervisor of the region. In actuality, his duties were performed by a local clergyman, who was elected by the people of Metsovo, approved by the patriarchate, and was obliged to act in the name of the catholic exarch. From 1818, the election of the clergyman was by vote of the ephors of the schools of Metsovo, with his election then being ratified by the patriarchate. The spiritual jurisdiction of the exarch comprised the settlements of Metsovo, Anilio, Derventista (now Anthohori), Votonosi, Milia, Koutsioufleani (now Platanistos), and Malakasi. In 1924, the Exarchate of Metsovo was temporarily upgraded to a metropolis, in order to accommodate the placement of clergy from Asia Minor who had lost their seats. In 1929, the metropolis was abolished without reinstating the exarchate. The region came under the Metropolis of Grevena until 1932, when Metsovo, Anilio, Votonosi and Derventista were annexed to the Metropolis of Ioannina. The Exarchate of Metsovo, functioning as the local representative of the religious ideals of the Patriarchate, played a major part in the formation of the religious and national conscience of the higher social classes of Metsovo.

====The scholars and clergy of Metsovo====
The economic and social growth of Metsovo during the 18th century is reflected in the efforts of the residents to upgrade their level of education. Indicative of these efforts is the establishment of a school as early as the beginning of the 18th century, the continuous care to maintain its operation, and studying abroad in European universities to receive higher education. The result of this process is the appearance of a class of scholars, teachers, and clergymen who participate actively in the intellectual life in the territories of modern Greece. Among these scholars we find Parthenios Katzoulis, Anastasios Metsovitis, Konstantinos of Metsovo, Tryfon of Metsovo, Demetrios Vardakas, Adam Tsapekos, Anastasios of Metsovo, Dositheos Driinoupoleos, Konstantinos Peltekis, Konstantinos Tzikas, Triantafyllos Hatzis Stergiou, Christoforos Varlamitis, the Kyriakos brothers, Konstantinos and Theofilos Tzarzoulis, as well as their father Nikolaos Tzartzoulis who is considered one of the &quot;Teachers of the Nation&quot; by Greek historians.

===The merchants of Metsovo===


The merchants in Metsovo were peddlers that became very active in commercial trade, in both the Ottoman Empire and in Europe.

====Socioeconomic growth of Metsovo====
The impressive socioeconomic growth of Metsovo during the Ottoman occupation is mainly due to the involvement of a large part of its population in the commercial activities of both the Ottoman Empire and of Europe. Taking into account the fact that the residents of Metsovo had been migrating for a long time, it is difficult to determine the beginning of its commercial growth.

====Testimonies – sources====
Substantial information about the commercial development of Metsovo are found from the mid-17th century onward, when we see testimonies of the presence of peddlers from Metsovo in Constantinople and Venice, which indicates an early phase of their involvement in commercial trade in the eastern Mediterranean. During the 18th century we see testimonies of the presence of Metsovite merchants in Constantinople, Bucharest, and Vienna. By the end of the 18th century there is an established community of merchants in Metsovo, which, through a collaborative or overlapping trade network, spread its operations over a rather extensive geographic area.

====19th century====
The first decade of the 19th century signaled the beginning of the most dynamic phase of commercial activity by the Metsovites. Now the geographic and economic reach of their activity exceeds its initial range. Their activity extends as far as Moscow, Cairo, Malta, Livorno, and Trieste.

====Cities of activity====
Records show that Metsovite merchants had a permanent presence in the following cities and towns: Corfu, Serres, Filippoupoli, Odessa, Brody, Moscow, Petersburg, Sevastopol, Nizna, Thessaloniki, in the Romanian cities of Orsova, Chisinau, Iasi, Ismail (Bessarabia), Craiova, Focsani, Galatsi, and Odessa, and a presence in the trade fairs and open-air markets of Perlepe, Sistov, Uzungiova, Rostov, Smyrna, Cyprus, and Damascus. Naturally, the old trade strongholds of Constantinople, Bucharest, and Vienna continued to present the largest concentrations of Metsovite merchants.

====Alexandria====
Another significant overseas hub of commercial activity for Metsovites is the port of Alexandria, in Egypt. The latest records show that the nature of their trading has changed dramatically from the times of their traditional land transport and trade fairs in the Balkans. Although the traditional method of commerce still occupies the merchants that are based in Metsovo or Ioannina, a large number of Metsovite merchants has established trading companies and agencies in distant places where they are occupied with all types of import and export trade.

==Province==
The province of Metsovo () was one of the provinces of the Ioannina Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality of Metsovo, except for most of the municipal unit of Egnatia. It was abolished in 2006.

==Municipality==
The present municipality of Metsovo was created by the 2011 local government reform, by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities that became municipal units:
*Metsovo
*Egnatia
*Milea

The municipality of Metsovo has an area of , the municipal unit of Metsovo has an area of , and the community of Metsovo has an area of .

==Demographics==
==Climate==
Metsovo has a temperate climate with snowy winters and pleasant summers. Precipitation is high all year with a drying trend in summer.

==Transportation==
In the 1980s, a nearby tunnel was constructed that was the longest in Greece, alleviating traffic that would otherwise clog Metsovo&#x27;s twisting roads. In 2006, the junction between the A2 motorway and a section of Greek National Road (Ioannina – Trikala) made for a superhighway with two exits at Metsovo.

==Culture/attractions==

===Cuisine===
The town is famous for its local cheeses (Metsovone and Metsovela, among others) and for its winemaking industries, including the &quot;Katógi&quot; vineyard of the Averoff family.

===Other===
A museum named Averoff Gallery is dedicated to Georgios Averoff. Metsovo is a popular winter vacation destination and ski resort town. The Metsovo Ski Centre is situated not far from the centre of Metsovo.

Metsovo is included in the Aromanian traditional song &quot;Di la Aminciu pãn&#x27; la Ameru&quot; (&quot;From Metsovo to Milea&quot;).

<text>Peter Baynham is a Welsh screenwriter and performer. He appeared in a series of comedic Pot Noodle television adverts in the 1990s. His writing work includes collaborations with comedy figures such as Armando Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Chris Morris, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Sarah Smith. Born in Cardiff, Baynham served in the Merchant Navy after leaving school and later pursued a career in comedy — first in stand-up, and then as a writer and performer for various news and sketch comedies in radio and television while enjoying personal fame starring in Pot Noodle adverts. He then became a writer in feature film.

In television, with Iannucci he is writer for &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, developing the character Alan Partridge as performed by Coogan, and as writer and host of the &quot;Armistice&quot; review shows. With Morris, he is writer for &quot;The Day Today&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, and &quot;Jam&quot;. Baynham himself created the animated series &quot;I Am Not an Animal&quot;. In feature film, with Baron Cohen he is writer for &quot;Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot; (2006), &quot;Brüno&quot; (2009), &quot;Grimsby&quot; (2016), and &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot; (2020). With Smith, he is writer for &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot; (2011) and &quot;Ron&#x27;s Gone Wrong&quot; (2021). With Iannucci and Coogan, he is writer for &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; (2013). Other features as writer include &quot;Arthur&quot; (2011) and &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Baynham was born and raised in Cardiff as the second of four children. He attended St Mary&#x27;s primary school in Canton, then Lady Mary RC High School in Cyncoed. Baynham said he found school difficult, finding himself shy, &quot;&quot;, and unpopular. He found himself too unathletic to enjoy rugby, despite expectations from his father. He left school with eight O-Levels, four with an &quot;A&quot; grade, and joined the Merchant Navy at age 16 with a desire to travel the world. Baynham described his experience in the Merchant Navy as unsuited to his character, he said &quot;I was with men who drank beer for breakfast. A lot of them were fascist, and I mean really fascist. They say travel should broaden the mind but these blokes would have been kicked out of the Ku Klux Klan for being too extreme&quot;. Duties included performing operations on a chemical tanker while wearing a hazmat suit. He reflected, &quot;I&#x27;m small and would basically float around inside the suit like a confused foetus, trying to pick up spanners and operate a walkie-talkie&quot;. Baynham is qualified to navigate a supertanker. After five years, he was made redundant due to government cuts in defence. He went on to serve as second mate on a private yacht in Monte Carlo as a summer job.

==Career==

===1987-2004: radio and television===
In 1987 he moved to London with his brother and worked selling advertising space in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. He began attending a comedy workshop, The Comedy Store. He became a stand-up comedian, and created the character Mr Buckstead, a psychotic teacher and poet. Baynham said the act consisted of &quot;[talking] about the terrible things he did to his pupils&quot;. During this period he financially supported himself with self-employment income under the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, his redundancy cheque from Merchant Navy, and a bank loan that was nominally meant for buying a car. He earned around £20 (GBP) per gig, and made £4,500 in his first year. To additionally support himself, he wrote sketches for the topical radio comedy &quot;Week Ending&quot;. He earned £18 for each minute of material, and contributed around two minutes of material each week. After four years he felt his stand-up career was not progressing, and decided to commit to radio. He became cast for the comedy sketch radio series &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;.

Aiming to break into television, Baynham wrote one-liner jokes for a Friday night show presented by Terry Wogan. He was unimpressed by Wogan&#x27;s delivery of the jokes. Baynham, working at the BBC offices, encountered Armando Iannucci while looking for photocopier paper. Iannucci would introduce him to Chris Morris, who was creating the news satire &quot;The Day Today&quot;. Although Morris was not interested in accepting more writers for the project, he was made a writer after Morris was impressed by a sketch he wrote that involved horses infesting the London Underground. He also appears in a sketch as a reporter named Colin Poppshed who presented &quot;Gay News&quot;, where he farcically announces the gayness of various &quot;roads, periodic table elements, cars, and walls&quot;. He also became a guest and contributor for the radio series &quot;The Chris Morris Music Show&quot;; he was suspended by the BBC for two weeks for conceiving a joke where Morris falsely implies on air that Michael Heseltine had died. Baynham stated that Morris technically did not announce his death, and had only said &quot;if there is any news of Michael Heseltine&#x27;s death in the next hour, we&#x27;ll let you know&quot;. Other radio work included being cast for &quot;Lee and Herring&quot;.

Baynham became a writer for the sitcom &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, a spin-off of the comedy character Alan Partridge as performed by Steve Coogan in &quot;The Day Today&quot;, an incompetent sports reporter progressed as a tactless and self-satisfied television personality. He thought that Alan Partridge was underdeveloped because the format of &quot;The Day Today&quot; made him &quot;bracketed and contained within presenting to [the] camera&quot;. Here he would realise Alan Partridge as a &quot;three-dimensional&quot; character. He, with the writing team, applied worldbuilding, such as establishing the geography of Alan Partridge&#x27;s residence of &quot;Linton Travel Tavern&quot;. Coogan credited Baynham for making Alan Partridge more human and sympathetic. Baynham described his work on &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as a highly productive and enjoyable period of his career, saying &quot;It&#x27;s my happiest, most fun writing experience ever really, it was just so exciting&quot;.

In the same period, &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; transferred to television where Baynham makes an on-screen appearance of his character &quot;Peter&quot;, a &quot;stinking 32-year-old Welsh virgin&quot;. He also served as writer and host of the &quot;Armistice&quot; news review shows. Baynham created and performed the character &quot;Terry from Pontypridd&quot; in a popular television advertising campaign for Pot Noodle, promoted with the catchphrase &quot;they&#x27;re too gorgeous&quot;. The campaign propelled him to unexpected fame; he reported that strangers would shout &quot;gorgeous&quot; at him in public, and that a university student threw a Pot Noodle at him on stage while touring with Lee and Herring. Other television work include &quot;Brass Eye&quot; with Morris, notably as writer for the controversial special &quot;Paedogeddon!&quot; that attracted widespread media attention for its comedic portrayal of paedophilia. Other credits include writer for episodes of &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot;, and writing additional material for the sketch show &quot;Big Train&quot;. He served as writer for the radio series &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, which transferred to television as &quot;Jam&quot;. He also became a guest for the radio comedy game show &quot;The 99p Challenge&quot;.

He became writer for the animated sketch comedy &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;. He created the animated black comedy &quot;I am Not an Animal&quot;, which follows a group of intelligent talking animals who escape a vivisection laboratory.

===2005-present: feature film===
Baynham felt uncertain about his future in television after &quot;I Am Not an Animal&quot; was poorly received by BBC executives, one of whom told him, &quot;I won&#x27;t be paying a return visit to this&quot;. Meanwhile, he received a phone call from Sacha Baron Cohen who asked him if he could help continue his faltering feature film project he had been working on based on the comedy character Borat. Baynham replied that he was not interested because he was working on creating his own sitcom, but then changed his mind and phoned Baron Cohen later that day expressing interest, and became writer for the 2006 film &quot;Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;. After the success of &quot;Borat&quot;, he continued his collaboration with Baron Cohen and became writer for the 2009 film &quot;Brüno&quot;.

Under director Jason Winer he became writer for the 2011 film &quot;Arthur&quot;, a recreation of the 1981 film starring Russell Brand.

Earlier, in 2005, Baynham conceived of a Christmas story where Santa Claus has an &quot;impractical and useless&quot; son, and collaborated with Sarah Smith at Aardman Animations to write a screenplay for the 2011 film &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot;. The story deals with Santa&#x27;s global operation to deliver presents to every child, which Baynham said he considered with &quot;pedantic&quot; detail, such as what would be mathematically possible in 12 hours with one million elves and a mile wide spaceship.

Under director Genndy Tartakovsky he became writer for the 2012 animated film &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot;.

Baynham collaborated with Iannucci and Coogan again to create a feature film based on Alan Partridge, and became writer for the 2013 film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot;.

With Baron Cohen again he became writer for the 2016 film &quot;Grimsby&quot;, and continued this collaboration as writer for the 2020 film &quot;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm&quot;, a sequel to the previous &quot;Borat&quot; film.

In 2021, Baynham - along with close friend and long-time collaborator Jeremy Simmonds - launched the surreal comedy podcast &quot;Brain Cigar&quot;. This has so far run to six episodes and a &#x27;Christmas special&#x27;.

==Reputation==
James Rampton writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; described him as &quot;an anonymous foot-soldier in Armando Iannucci&#x27;s all-conquering comedy army&quot;. Brendon Connelley writing for &quot;/Film&quot; said, &quot;Baynham isn&#x27;t exactly comedy royalty in the UK — more like a secret power behind the thrones&quot;. Baynham himself reflected, &quot;It feels quite cool, in a mad way, to be someone who skulks about in the shadows&quot;. Kathryn Williams for WalesOnline argued that he &quot;revolutionised both topical satire and character comedy in the 1990s&quot;, along with Iannucci, Coogan, and Morris.

==Personal life==
Baynham settled in Los Angeles after completing &quot;Borat&quot;. He is a citizen of the United States.

<doc id="756628" wikidata="Q1348458" url="?curid=756628" title="William Henry O'Connell">
<text>William Henry O&#x27;Connell (December 8, 1859 – April 22, 1944) was an American cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Boston from 1907 until his death in 1944, and was made a cardinal in 1911.

==Early life==
William O&#x27;Connell was born on December 8, 1859, in Lowell, Massachusetts, to John and Bridget (née Farrelly) O&#x27;Connell, who were Irish immigrants. The youngest of eleven children, he had six brothers and four sisters. His father worked at a textile mill and died when William was four years old. During his high school career, he excelled at music, particularly the piano and organ.

O&#x27;Connell entered St. Charles College in Ellicott City, Maryland, in 1876. At St. Charles, he was a pupil of the noted poet John Banister Tabb. He returned to Massachusetts two years later and entered Boston College, from which he graduated in 1881 with gold medals in philosophy, physics, and chemistry. He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome.

==Priesthood==
O&#x27;Connell was ordained to the priesthood by Lucido Cardinal Parocchi on June 8, 1884. A pneumonia and bronchial congestion cut short his pursuit of a doctorate in divinity at the Pontifical Urban Athenaeum, forcing him to return to the United States in 1885 without his degree.

He then served as curate of St. Joseph Church in Medford until 1886, when he became curate of St. Joseph Church in the West End of Boston. Returning to Rome, O&#x27;Connell was named rector of the North American College in 1895. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness in 1897.

==Episcopal career==

===Bishop of Portland in Maine===
On February 8, 1901, O&#x27;Connell was appointed the third Bishop of Portland, Maine, by Pope Leo XIII. He chose for his Episcopal Motto &quot;Vigor In Arduis&quot; meaning Strength in Adversity. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 19 from Francesco Cardinal Satolli, with Archbishops Edmund Stonor and Rafael Merry del Val, at the Lateran Basilica. Upon his arrival in Maine, he was given an official reception by Governor John F. Hill. He was presented with a reliquary of the True Cross by Pope Pius X after the latter&#x27;s election in 1903.

In 1905, in addition to his duties as a diocesan bishop, O&#x27;Connell was named papal envoy to Emperor Meiji of Japan; he was also decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure and made an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1905. He was viewed as having actively campaigned to become Archbishop of Boston, donating to numerous Vatican causes and publicly expressing his loyalty to the pope.

===Archbishop of Boston, and Cardinal===

O&#x27;Connell was named Coadjutor Archbishop of Boston with right of succession and Titular Archbishop of &quot;Constantina&quot; on February 21, 1906. As coadjutor, he served as the designated successor of Archbishop John Williams, who was then in declining health. He later succeeded Williams as the second Archbishop of Boston upon the latter&#x27;s death on August 30, 1907.

On November 27, 1911, O&#x27;Connell became Boston&#x27;s first Archbishop to become Cardinal, and was given the title of Cardinal-Priest of S. Clemente. He arrived late to two papal conclaves in a row, in 1914 and 1922, due to having to cross the Atlantic Ocean in the slower transportation of the day. He made a protest to Pope Pius XI, who in response lengthened the time between the death of the Pope and the start of the conclave. O&#x27;Connell was finally able to participate in the subsequent 1939 conclave, although by that time air travel was available.

O&#x27;Connell favored a highly centralized diocesan organization, encompassing schools, hospitals, and asylums in addition to parishes. He wielded immense political and social power in Massachusetts, earning him the nickname &quot;Number One&quot;. For instance, he was responsible for defeating a bill to establish a state lottery in 1935, and for defeating a referendum liberalizing state birth control laws in 1942. The only politician who had anywhere near O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s political clout was Governor (and future U.S. President) Calvin Coolidge, but even Coolidge picked his battles carefully, preferring to ignore the Archbishop whenever possible. In the years leading up to the Second World War O&#x27;Connell became a powerful force for the neutralists in trying to keep the United States out of World War II in the pre-Pearl Harbor era.

==Views==
Having presided over the marriage of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and Rose Fitzgerald in 1914, he asked actress Gloria Swanson to end her affair with Kennedy.

He opposed the Child Labor Amendment and called Hollywood &quot;the scandal of the nation&quot;.

He denounced the theories of Albert Einstein as &quot;authentic atheism, even if camouflaged as cosmic pantheism&quot;.

He opposed euthanasia, calling suffering &quot;the discipline of humanity&quot;.

He told his priests that they might refuse communion to women wearing lipstick.

He also condemned crooning: &quot;No true American man would practice this base art. Of course, they aren&#x27;t men. ... If you will listen closely [to crooners&#x27; songs] you will discern the basest appeal to sex emotion in the young.&quot;

He had a cool relationship with his auxiliary bishop Francis Spellman, who later was the Archbishop of New York. O&#x27;Connell once said, &quot;Francis epitomizes what happens to a bookkeeper when you teach him how to read.&quot;

He was also decidedly non-ecumenical. In 1908 he said, &quot;The Puritan has passed. The Catholic remains.&quot;

==Influence==
He was very influential with the growth of the Catholic Church. He was called by politicians &quot;Number One&quot; and enjoyed them frequently requesting his approval on issues. He was called a &quot;battleship in full array&quot;.

O&#x27;Connell was the first American to be given honorary life membership in the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus.

==Other affairs==

===Scandal over nephew===

O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s nephew James P. O&#x27;Connell, who served as chancellor of the archdiocese, had secretly married in 1913. Some of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s clerical enemies discovered this and reported it to Vatican authorities. The younger O&#x27;Connell was removed from office and from his priestly duties in 1920. His marriage lasted until his death in 1948. Little else is known of the relationship between uncle and nephew.

===Falsified dates of authorship ===
In 1915, O&#x27;Connell published a collection of letters which, the publication claimed, he wrote between 1876 and 1901. In 1987, James M. O&#x27;Toole discovered that O&#x27;Connell had written the letters expressly for the 1915 publication. Other scholars who discussed the subject of the letters in 1975 had found the dates on the letters &quot;suspect&quot;.

===Frances Sweeney===
In the early 1940s when Frances Sweeney, editor of the &quot;Boston City Reporter&quot;, criticized O&#x27;Connell for his passivity in the face of rampant antisemitism in Boston, O&#x27;Connell summoned Sweeney to his office and threatened her with excommunication.

==Death==
William O&#x27;Connell died from pneumonia in Brighton, aged 84. He was buried in the crypt of a small chapel (Immaculate Conception) he had built on the grounds of St. John&#x27;s Seminary. In 2004 the Archdiocese sold the property to Boston College and in 2007 announced plans to relocate his remains to Saint Sebastian&#x27;s School, which O&#x27;Connell founded in 1941. After a protracted lawsuit, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s relatives, who had opposed any disinterment, agreed that his remains would be removed to a courtyard of the Seminary. The reinterment took place on July 20, 2011.

==Legacy==
His 36-year-long tenure was the longest in the history of the Archdiocese of Boston. He was the second-to-last surviving cardinal created by Pope Pius X behind Gennaro Granito Pignatelli di Belmonte and is the third-longest serving American cardinal behind James Gibbons and William Wakefield Baum. During O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s tenure as Archbishop of Boston, the number of women in religious life increased from 1567 to 5459; the number of parishes increased from 194 to 322; the number of churches increased from 248 to 375; the number of diocesan priests increased from 488 to 947; the archdiocese was operating 3 Catholic hospitals. According to one historian, &quot;It was under O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s influence too, that the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of Boston assumed a conceptual solidarity and impressive visibility that it had never seen before and would never see again.&quot;

One of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s grandnephews, Paul G. Kirk, served briefly as U.S. Senator in 2009.

==In popular culture==
In Henry Morton Robinson&#x27;s best-selling 1950 historical novel, &quot;The Cardinal&quot;, the Archbishop of Boston in the exact time frame as O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s term in office is named &quot;Lawrence Cardinal Glennon&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s physical descriptions of Glennon, his massive building program, his arriving late for two papal conclaves and arriving in time for a third, his popular description as &quot;Number One&quot; and many other details of the Glennon character correspond with O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s career and personality. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; of the title, however, is a young priest who serves as Glennon&#x27;s secretary and himself becomes a cardinal in the course of the novel.

==Hymns==
In addition to his published volumes of letters, sermons and addresses, O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s legacy includes a collection of hymns under the title &quot;Holy Cross Hymnal&quot; published by McLaughlin and Reilly, Boston, in 1915., including:
* &quot;Hymn to the Holy Cross&quot;
* &quot;Hymn to the Holy Name&quot;
* &quot;Prayer for a Perfect Life&quot;

<text>Michael O&#x27;Connor, S.J. (September 27, 1810 – October 18, 1872) was an Irish-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States and a member of the Society of Jesus. He served twice as bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania (1843 to early 1853 and late 1853 to 1860). O&#x27;Connor served briefly as bishop of the Diocese of Erie for several months in 1853.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Michael O&#x27;Connor was born in Cobh, near the city of Cork, in County Cork, Ireland. His younger brother, James, would serve as the first Bishop of Omaha from 1885 to 1891. Michael O&#x27;Connor received his early education in Cobh, where he attended a school attached to the Cathedral of Cloyne. At age 14, he was sent by William Coppinger, the Catholic Bishop of Cloyne, to begin his studies for the priesthood in France.

O&#x27;Connor continued his studies at the Urban College of the Propaganda in Rome. He completed his courses in philosophy and theology with distinction, and won a gold medal for being the first in mathematics. He finished his studies before reaching the canonical age for ordination, and spent the interval as a professor of Sacred Scriptures at the College of Propaganda. O&#x27;Connor earned a Doctor of Divinity degree following a public disputation, in which he underwent the same test made by Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure at the University of Paris in the 13th century.

==Priesthood==
O&#x27;Connor was ordained a priest in Rome on June 1, 1833, by then-Archbishop Costantino Patrizi Naro. He was then appointed as vice-rector of the Pontifical Irish College in Rome. He also served as an agent of the Irish bishops with the Holy See, working with Pope Gregory XVI and Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman. In 1834, O&#x27;Connor returned to Ireland and served as a curate in Fermoy. He was also chaplain for the convent of the Presentation Sisters in Doneraile. He applied for the position of professor of dogmatic theology at Maynooth College but was persuaded by a colleague, Peter Kenrick, to pursue a teaching position in the United States.

In 1839, Patrick Kenrick&#x27;s brother, Francis, a former schoolmate of O&#x27;Connor in Rome, was by then the Bishop of Philadelphia and invited him to join the faculty of St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia. O&#x27;Connor accepted the offer, and arrived in Philadelphia later in 1839. He immediately assumed the chair of theology at St. Charles, of which he became president soon afterwards. In addition to his academic duties, O&#x27;Connon ministered at the missions in Norristown, Pennsylvania and West Chester, Pennsylvania twice a month. He also founded St. Francis Xavier Parish in the Fairmount section of Philadelphia. In 1840, O&#x27;Connor was relieved of his duties as a professor and missionary, but continued to serve as President of St. Charles Seminary.

In June 1841, O&#x27;Connor was appointed as vicar general of Western Pennsylvania and pastor of St. Paul&#x27;s Parish in Pittsburgh. He there established a parochial school and organized a literary society for young men.

==Bishop of Pittsburgh==

The Fifth Provincial Council of Baltimore, held in May 1843, recommended the erection of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and nominated O&#x27;Connor as its first Bishop. When Pope Gregory XVI accepted the recommendation, O&#x27;Connor traveled to Rome for consecration as a bishop. However, once there he petitioned the pope to revoke his appointment and to allow him instead to enter the Jesuits instead. Gregory refused and said, &quot;You shall be bishop first, and a Jesuit afterwards&quot;. O&#x27;Connor accepted the pope&#x27;s will and was formally appointed the first bishop of Pittsburgh on August 11, 1843. On August 15, he received his consecration from Cardinal Giacomo Fransoni at the Church of Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti in Rome.

On his return to the United States, O&#x27;Connor passed through Ireland to recruit clergy for his new diocese, obtaining eight seminarians from Maynooth College and seven Sisters of Mercy from Dublin. He arrived in Pittsburgh in December 1843, where he found a diocese comprising 33 churches, 14 priests, and about 25,000 Catholics. To organize the new diocese, he held the first diocesan synod in 1844, and the same year he founded a girls&#x27; academy and orphan asylum, a chapel for African Americans, the &quot;Pittsburgh Catholic&quot; and St. Michael&#x27;s Seminary. To serve the German immigrants in his diocese, he welcomed the Benedictine monks who founded Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, the first Benedictine monastery in the United States, and to further education he invited the Franciscan Brothers of Mountbellew in Ireland, who established the first community of religious brothers in the United States in Loretto.

== Bishop of Erie ==
On July 29, 1853, O&#x27;Connor was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Erie by Pope Pius IX. The dividing line of the new diocese ran east and west along the northern boundaries of Cambria, Indiana, Armstrong, Butler, and Lawrence Counties, giving thirteen northern counties to the Diocese of Erie and fifteen to the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Father Joshua Young was named his successor in Pittsburgh, but Young&#x27;s reluctance to become bishop of Pittsburgh and the petition of Pittsburgh Catholics to keep O&#x27;Connor moved the Holy See to reverse its decision.

== Bishop of Pittsburgh ==
Five months after his transfer to Erie, O&#x27;Connor was re-appointed as bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh on December 20, 1853, and Young accepted the leadership of Erie.

In 1854, O&#x27;Connor was summoned to Rome to take part in the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, and it is said that changes in the wording of the decree were due to his suggestions. His health entered into a steady decline and, on the advice of his physicians, traveled throughout Europe, Asia, and North America in search of a more hospitable climate. At the end of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s tenure, the diocese contained 77 churches, 86 priests, six religious congregations, one seminary, five institutions of higher education, two orphan asylums, one hospital, and a Catholic population of 50,000.

== Resignation and later life ==
O&#x27;Connor resigned as bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh on May 23, 1860. Pursuing his desire to join the Society of Jesus, he sailed for Europe the following October and was admitted into the Jesuit novitiate at Gorheim, (now part of Sigmaringen), in the Kingdom of Prussia, on December 22. In 1862, when he had completed the novitiate, by a special dispensation of the Jesuit Superior General, Peter Jan Beckx, O&#x27;Connor was permitted to make his solemn profession of the four religious vows unique to the Society immediately, bypassing the normal 15 years of full formation in the Society.

O&#x27;Connor was then assigned to the Jesuit community in Boston, Massachusetts, where he made his religious profession on December 23, 1862. When Boston College was formally founded in 1864, he became a member of the faculty for the new school, where he taught theology. Additionally, he was appointed &quot;socius&quot; (counselor) to the Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in the United States, a position in which he remained until his death. He took a special interest in the spiritual welfare of African Americans, and delivered lectures in many parts of the United States and Canada.

His health failing, O&#x27;Connor was sent to rest at Woodstock College in Maryland during the spring of 1872. He died there some months later, at the age of sixty-two. He is buried in the Jesuit cemetery at Woodstock.

<text>Thomas Power O&#x27;Connor, PC (5 October 1848 – 18 November 1929), known as T. P. O&#x27;Connor and occasionally as Tay Pay (mimicking the Irish pronunciation of the initials &quot;T. P.&quot;), was an Irish nationalist politician and journalist who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for nearly fifty years.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Connor was born in Athlone, County Westmeath, on 5 October 1848. He was the eldest son of Thomas O&#x27;Connor, an Athlone shopkeeper, and his wife Teresa (née Power), the daughter of a non-commissioned officer in the Connaught Rangers. His family were supporters of the Liberal Party. He was educated at the College of the Immaculate Conception in Athlone, and Queen&#x27;s College Galway, where he won scholarships in history and modern languages and built up a reputation as an orator, serving as auditor of the college&#x27;s Literary and Debating Society.

==Career==
From 1867, O&#x27;Connor attempted unsuccessfully to gain a position in the Civil Service before working for the Royal Irish Constabulary as a reporting assistant on nationalist political demonstrations. He entered journalism as a junior reporter on &quot;Saunders&#x27; Newsletter&quot;, a Dublin journal. In 1870, he moved to London, and was appointed a sub-editor on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, principally on account of the utility of his mastery of French and German in reportage of the Franco-Prussian War. He later became London correspondent for &quot;The New York Herald&quot;. He compiled the society magazine &quot;Mainly About People&quot; (M.A.P.) from 1898 to 1911.

O&#x27;Connor was elected Member of Parliament for Galway Borough in the 1880 general election, as a representative of the Home Rule League (which was under the leadership of William Shaw, though virtually led by Charles Stewart Parnell, who would win the party&#x27;s leadership a short time later). O&#x27;Connor had been invited to stand as the Liberal candidate for the constituency on the strength of the unflattering biography of then Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli he had written in 1878. However, after being persuaded by Parnell, O&#x27;Connor stood reluctantly as an Irish party candidate. Despite opposition from Irish Catholic clergymen to the selection of the reputedly agnostic O&#x27;Connor as the Irish Nationalist candidate, he won the seat - allegedly with some support from the Irish Republican Brotherhood - because of his vocal support for the ideals of the Irish National Land League. By now a permanent resident of London, who spoke with a London accent, he did not generally speak at land rallies but was appointed to the Land League executive by Parnell. He also made four visits to the U.S. to raise funds for his party from politically engaged Irish Americans.

At the next general election in 1885, O&#x27;Connor was returned both for Galway and for the Liverpool Scotland constituencies, which had a large Irish population. He chose to sit for Liverpool, and represented that constituency in the House of Commons from 1885 until his death in 1929. He remains the only British MP from an Irish nationalist party ever to be elected to a constituency outside of the island of Ireland. O&#x27;Connor continued to be re-elected in Liverpool under this label unopposed in the 1918, 1922, 1923, 1924 and 1929 general elections, despite the declaration of a &quot;de facto&quot; Irish Republic in early 1919, and the establishment by 1921 treaty of a quasi-independent Irish Free State in late 1922.
From 1905, he belonged to the central leadership of the United Irish League. Although in his later years he was often criticised for distancing himself from the Irish community, he remained the most prominent Irish nationalist politician in Great Britain, and was on close terms with each successive government, and with David Lloyd George in particular. During much of his time in parliament, he wrote a nightly sketch of proceedings there for the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;. He was a highly popular and respected figure among MPs from all parties. At the 1918 general election, following the retirement of Liberal-Labour MP Thomas Burt, O&#x27;Connor became &quot;Father of the House of Commons&quot;, and ultimately would achieve unbroken service of 49 years, 215 days.

O&#x27;Connor supported the Irish Reform Association, and by the 1910s, he had come to accept the idea of partition. Having drawn the admiration of even the Ulster Unionist leader Sir Edward Carson, he played a leading role in the Irish Convention in 1917. The Irish Nationalist Party ceased to exist effectively after the Sinn Féin landslide of 1918, and thereafter O&#x27;Connor effectively sat as an independent, although from the early 1910s, he had been rallying Irish people in Great Britain behind the Labour Party. On 13 April 1920, O&#x27;Connor warned the House of Commons that the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe would galvanise opinion in Ireland and unite all Irishmen in opposition to British rule. He nonetheless supported the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, although he subsequently appealed in vain to the British government to moderate its demand for a substantial contribution from the newly created Irish Free State to the imperial exchequer.

===Newspapers and journals===
T. P. O&#x27;Connor founded and was the first editor of several newspapers and journals: &quot;The Star&quot;, the &quot;Weekly Sun&quot; (1891), &quot;The Sun&quot; (1893), &quot;M.A.P. and T.P.&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (1902). In August 1906, O&#x27;Connor was instrumental in the passing by Parliament of the Musical Copyright Act 1906, also known as the T.P. O&#x27;Connor Bill, following many of the popular music writers at the time dying in poverty due to extensive piracy by gangs during the piracy crisis of sheet music in the early 20th century. The gangs would often buy a copy of the music at full price, copy it, and resell it, often at half the price of the original. The film &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot; (1945), commissioned by the British Ministry of Information, is based on the events of the day.

He was appointed as the second president of the Board of Film Censors in 1916 and appeared in front of the Cinema Commission of Inquiry (1916), set up by the National Council of Public Morals where he outlined the BBFC&#x27;s position on protecting public morals by listing forty-three infractions, from the BBFC 1913–1915 reports, on why scenes in a film may be cut. He was appointed to the Privy Council by the first Labour government in 1924. However, he declined the offer of a peerage, considering the House of Lords to be elitist. He was also a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Journalists, the world&#x27;s oldest journalists&#x27; organisation. It continues to honour him by having a T.P. O&#x27;Connor charity fund. On his eightieth birthday in 1928, O&#x27;Connor was invited to dine with King George V, and despite being confined to a wheelchair, he continued to attend parliamentary debates until his death.

==Personal life==
In 1885, O&#x27;Connor married Elizabeth Howard (née Paschal), a daughter of George W. Paschal, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. The couple, who had no children, rarely lived together, and had separated permanently by the outbreak of World War I, but remained married until O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death.

==Death==
O&#x27;Connor fell seriously ill in 1929; a substantial collection for him was raised in the House of Commons. He died at his flat in Westminster on 18 November 1929 and is buried at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green in north-west London. He was the last Father of the House to die as a sitting MP until Sir Gerald Kaufman in 2017.
